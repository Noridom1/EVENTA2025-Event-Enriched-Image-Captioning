        "content": "(CNN)After several weeks of searching and waiting for news on victims from the Champlain Towers South condominium collapse in Surfside, Florida, all 242 people have been accounted for.Ninety-eight victims have now been identified, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said Monday, including 97 victims who were recovered from the collapse and one person who died in the hospital. Ninety-eight families have been notified, and all 97 people for whom there was a missing persons report have been recovered.Officials had promised families that they would not let up until all of their loved ones were found. Now, that promise has been fulfilled.The victims reflect the area's rich cultural diversity -- the international tragedy has touched members of a tight-knit Jewish community and families from as far away as Argentina, Paraguay and Colombia.Search and rescue teams scoured the site since shortly after 55 of the 13-story residential building's 136 units fell at around 1:30 a.m. on June 24. Read MoreThe death toll has reached nearly 100, with the victims ranging in age from 1 to 92.Cava said the collapse was \"the largest non-hurricane related emergency response in the history of our state.\" While nothing can bring back the victims of the collapse, she said \"we have done everything possible to bring closure to the families.\"Among the victims are: Ingrid Ainsworth, 66; Tzvi Ainsworth, 68; Michael David Altman, 50; Luis Bermudez, 26; Claudio Bonnefoy, 85; Maria Obias-Bonnefoy, 69; Andrea Cattarossi, 56; Gino Cattarossi, 89; Graciela Cattarossi, 86; Graciela Cattarossi, 48; Stella Cattarossi, 7; Brad Cohen, 51; Gary Cohen, 58; Magaly Elenda Delgado, 80; Bonnie Epstein, 56; David Epstein, 58; Christina Beatriz Elvira, 74; Stacie Fang, 54; Francis Fernandez, 67; Andreas Giannitsopoulos, 21; Emma Guara, 4; Lucia Guara, 11; Marcus Joseph Guara, 52; Frank Kleiman, 55; Jay Kleiman, 52; Manuel LaFont, 54;  Nancy Kress Levin, 76; Antonio Lozano, 82; Gladys Lozano, 80; Gloria Machado, 71; Ruslan Manashirov, 36; Juan Alberto Mora Jr., 32; Hilda Noriega, 92; Leon Oliwkowicz, 80; Anna Ortiz, 46; Maria Popa, 79; Anaely Rodriguez, 42; Harold Rosenberg, 52; Elaine Lia Sabino, 71; Simon Segal, 80; Gonzalo Torre, 81; Maria Gabriela Camou Font, 64; Julio Cesar Velasquez, 66; Angela Velasquez, 60; Lorenzo De Oliveira Leone, 5; Alfredo Leone, 48; Maria Torre, 76;  Richard Augustine, 77; Luis Sadovnic, 28; Edgar Gonzalez, 42; Alexia Maria Pettengill Lopez Moreira, 9, Anna Sophia Pettengill Lopez Moreira, 6; Luis Vicente Pettengill Lopez Moreira III, 3; Fabi\u00e1n Nu\u00f1ez, 57; Beatriz Rodriguez Guerra, 52; Lisa Rosenberg, 27; Arnold Notkin, 87; Judith Spiegel, 65; Nicole Dawn Doran, 43; Margarita Vasquez Bello, 68; Cassie Billedeau Stratton, 40; Catalina Gomez Ramirez, 45; Andres Levine, 26; Moises Rodan Brief, 28; Aishani Gia Patel, 1; Mercedes Fuentes Urgelles, 61; Raymond Urgelles, 61; Maria Notkin, 81; Michelle Anna Pazos, 23; Mihai Radulescu, 82; Valeria Barth, 14; Miguel Leonardo Kaufman, 65; Rosa Saez, 70; Theresa Velasquez, 36; Beatriz Rodriguez Guerra, 52; Oresme Gil Guerra, 60; Luis F.

On July 8, authorities made the decision to shift the search effort from rescue to recovery, and on July 15 the county decided it would only report the number of victims who had been identified \"out of respect for the families who are still waiting and to ensure we are reporting the most accurate possible numbers.\"Crews removed 18 million pounds of concrete from the collapse site, according to Cava.Gone but not forgottenEstelle HedayaEstelle Hedaya was the last victim identified in the Surfside condo collapse.Estelle Hedaya loved to dance. She even calls herself Cha Cha Cha on social media.Hedaya was the remaining victim who had not yet been identified.\"It was obviously tough to hear directly, but I can definitely see and feel the sense of relief [my parents] got knowing my sister can rest in peace,\" Ikey Hedaya, Estelle's brother, told CNN. \"This month has been excruciating to say the least.\"Her Miami friends described the Brooklyn native, who lived in unit 604, as a free spirit who loved traveling and new experiences and documented them all on her blog, Follow the Toes. \"She's so vibrant, so social,\" said Luc Davidson, a friend who's kept vigil at the Surfside hotel where authorities are updating loved ones on those still missing. \"She loved spas, dancing and working out. She was so adventurous. She tried a new restaurant every Sunday.\"Hedaya worked in the jewelry industry and shares details about her life and travels on Instagram.Days before the building crumbled, she was in Las Vegas, a trip she documented with photos of her lounging poolside at Caesar's Palace. Davidson said the last time they talked Hedaya was excited about her new car, a red Lexus she purchased a week before the condo collapsed. \"Now I really am the lady in red,\" Hedaya posted on Instagram, alongside an image of the car.In the comments, friends implored her to let them know that she's OK.  \"A lot of people love her,\" Davidson said. \"She's so full of good energy. We are worried about her. We're hoping for a miracle.\"Hedaya's friends said she was living her best life as a single woman. On her blog, she calls herself a \"New Yorker taking Miami by storm in the most fabulous fashion.\" In it she shared details of some of her dating misadventures and urged women to show themselves the same love they give others. Her last blog entry was a love letter to single women everywhere.\"I am here to tell you, children and a husband do not define who you are. DO NOT allow anyone to tell you anything different!,\" she wrote. \"The circle of single friends that I left in NY, are all beautiful, smart, strong, successful and self sufficient women ... They, like myself have chosen to be single rather than settling for an unfulfilling, unhappy relationship.\"Bonnie Epstein, 56, and David Epstein, 58David and Bonnie EpsteinJonathan Epstein lost both his parents, David, 58, and Bonnie, 56, who were asleep on the 9th floor when the building collapsed. He told CNN he had reached out to his mother from the family's Brooklyn home about an hour before the collapse to share a song with her, knowing she'd still be up because \"we were both night owls.\"\"We bonded over music a lot, so it was just a really quick text,\" he said. Right before he decided to head to bed, a news alert on his phone about a building collapse caught his attention, and he texted his mother again -- but that message was never received. He called multiple times, but never got a response. Last week, detectives informed him his parents had been recovered from the rubble. The couple grew up in northeast Philadelphia and attended high school and college in the city before meeting and settling down in Bucks County, according to CNN affiliate WPVI. Several years ago, they sold their Holland Township home and split their time between Brooklyn, Miami and their home in Ventnor, New Jersey.They had just celebrated their 31st wedding anniversary two months before the collapse, and were now enjoying early retirement -- often filling their time with activities like scuba diving and kite surfing. \"This is so weird and surreal that it's breaking in slowly and for the time being I just want to live in my parents' memory, to live the way that I think they'd want me to live and to honor their lives,\" Jonathan told CNN. \"They were just the best,\" he added.David and Bonnie's funeral and memorial services was held on Monday, July 12, in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. In lieu of any gifts, Jonathan is asking that people consider supporting Saving the Blue, a marine wildlife conservation non-profit his parents were dedicated to. \"Thank you to everyone for your kind words over this impossible week, my parents were really the best and it's been so comforting to relive the joy of their lives through the testimony of friends and loved ones,\" Jonathan wrote on Facebook.\"My parents touched so many lives in so many beautiful ways, and I'm relieved that we will be able to give them the memorial that they deserve,\" he wrote on July 6.Marcus Guara, 52; Lucia Guara, 11; Emma Guara, 4; Anaely Rodriguez, 42Pallbearers carry the shared casket of sisters Lucia and Emma Guara before their family's funeral service in Miami Beach on July 6.Among the youngest victims identified so far are 11-year-old Lucia Guara and 4-year-old Emma Guara; they are the daughters of 52-year-old Marcus Guara, whose body was recovered on June 26. His wife, 42-year-old Anaely Rodriguez, also died in the collapse.Three caskets were carried into St. Joseph's Catholic Church for the Guara family's funeral on July 6. Emma and Lucia were placed in the same casket, a decision made by the family according to the family's priest, Juan Sosa. The church, which is a few blocks from the site of the collapse, was filled with relatives and friends of the parents and their children. There were many moving moments, Sosa said; but he vividly remembers the friends of the children crying and embracing their parents.\"Family members were clinging on each other and that's good because they were able to hold one another and support one another,\" Sosa said.Sosa says that up to a dozen members of his congregation are unaccounted for. He knows at least four of them very well. Two weeks after the collapse, Sosa says he is still in shock. He has not had time to grieve.\"Let us appreciate the quality of life more than the quantity,\" Sosa said. \"More than what we have, is who we are as family.\"Friends said Marcus adored his two daughters and was the kindest man who would give the shirt off his back, according to CNN affiliate WSVN. Lucia loved singing, outer space and family, and Emma was described as a princess who loved building obstacle courses in the living room and her family.Guara's employer, Kassatex New York's CEO and founder Ernesto Khoudari, sent the following statement to CNN in an email:\"The Kassatex family is deeply saddened over the loss of Marcus Guara and his beautiful family. From the moment he started working with us, his creativity, vivacity for the business, charming smile, and never give up attitude fueled his passion for our company, and his relationships he made along the way. He was an amazing asset to the team and will be missed immensely.\"Graciela Cattarossi, 86; Gino Cattarossi, 89; Andrea Cattarossi, 56; and Stella Cattarossi, 7Stella Cattarossi, the 7-year-old daughter of a City of Miami Fire Rescue employee, was recovered from the rubble of the tower along with her mother Graciela, a family member confirmed.Graciela's niece, Nicole Mejias, told CNN's Natasha Chen that the pair were in the condo with three other family members when the building collapsed. \"We just miss them so much already,\" Mejias said. \"We wish this tragedy didn't happen, and will always remember them.\" Graciela and Gino's son Marcelo told Chen, \"My family was fantastic and it's still going to be fantastic.\"The anchors of his family were what he described as \"adventurous\" and \"fearless\" parents, who met in New York City in the 1950s when Graciela was a United Nations diplomat representing Uruguay, their son said. Gino was a civil engineer, who had immigrated from Argentina.After moving back and forth from the U.S. to Argentina, the family eventually moved to Miami in the late '80s, where they bought and renovated the Art Deco-style Lafayette Hotel, which is now part of the Blue Moon Hotel, listed on the National Register of Historic Places.Their own house was one filled with art, and a library of any book he could have asked for.\"[My mother] could do a perfect drawing. Just I mean, for a kid -- imagine that you sit down and your mom is drawing for you -- and she flooded us with books,\" he said.Marcelo said Stella was the the light of her mother and grandparents' lives. Taking after her artistic family, Stella had already begun painting. \"My family was fantastic and it's still going to be fantastic,\" Cattarossi said.Ruslan Manashirov, 36, and Nicole Doran, 43Recently married Ruslan Manashirov and Nicole Doran Manashirov were missing, Ruslan's sister-in-law told CNN affiliate News 12 Connecticut.Miami-Dade police identified Manashirov on July 8 and Doran on July 12 as being among those who died.Ruslan grew up in Bergen Beach in New York City and worked as a physician, his sister-in-law told News 12 Connecticut. Nicole grew up in Pittsburgh, CNN affiliate KDKA reported, citing friends.Leah Caliguire told KDKA that she said stayed at the couple's Champlain Towers South condo last month. \"It was a beautiful building, you would never think anything like this could possibly happen,\" she said.Magaly Elena Delgado, 80Magaly Elena Delgado, right, was identified as one of the victims of the Champlain Towers South collapse in Surfside, Florida. Delgado's daughter, Magaly Ramsey, spoke with CNN about her 80-year-old mother. \"My mom was a very independent woman. She came from Cuba, worked hard to make her way and was trying to live her best life at this moment, by the beach, by the water, which she loves,\" Ramsey said. Delgado had been living in Champlain Towers for the last 10 years on the ninth floor, Ramsey said. She loved living in the building and had a close-knit group of friends. Ramsey was at a conference in Orlando when she heard about the collapse. \"She actually called me Wednesday night when I was at the conference. I wasn't able to talk to her because I was at a meeting at the time. I was like 'I'll call her tomorrow morning' and that never happened,\" Ramsey said. The next morning she saw news about collapse. \"Never in a thousand years did I think that was her building or that her building was just not there anymore.\" Andreas Giannitsopoulos, 21Andreas GiannitsopoulosGiannitsopoulos was a student at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, according to the university. The university said it has reached out to the family of Giannitsopoulos to offer its support. \"We extend our deepest condolences to Andreas' family, friends, classmates and faculty as they deal with this unimaginable tragedy,\" a statement read. \"Our thoughts continue to be with all affected by the disaster as they await news of their loved ones and mourn those lost.\" Joe Malouf, Giannitsopoulos' high school track coach in Houston, told CNN he hopped on a plane to Florida with Giannitsopoulos' mother when news broke about the collapse. Malouf said 21-year-old Giannitsopoulos arrived in Surfside a couple weeks ago to stay with a \"dear family friend\" in the Champlain Towers. \"He was expected to come home a day before the collapse, but his friend wanted him to stay a bit longer so they could spend a bit more time together,\" Malouf said. The family and Maloujf headed to the site of the collapse hoping to be nearer to Giannitsopoulos, Malouf said.\"We had gone to the site to get as close to him as we could,\" Malouf said. \"The kids that I coach know how loud my voice is. I was screaming for him to come out, that we're here and just to be patient. Because of how loud my voice is, I know he would have heard it.\"Malouf coaches track at St. Thomas High School in Houston and met Giannitsopoulos when he tried out for the team as a freshman.Malouf said Giannitsopoulos was \"very good natured, conscientious, hardworking, first on and last off the field, wanted to know more to get better -- that's just his athletics.\"\"As a student, Andreas was a high-A student and taking not just your basic courses, but taking AP courses. He was very intelligent,\" the coach said.Beyond his academics and athletics, Giannitsopoulos was an avid horticulturalist, Malouf said. The college student would carry seeds wherever he traveled, ready to plant them.Malouf said his relationship with Giannitsopoulos developed from coach-athlete to a close friendship. They became workout partners at the gym and their friendship stayed close even when Giannitsopoulos went away to college. The pair would work out together at the gym when he was back home for the summer.\"When he came home from college, I felt like I was the first person he would call,\" Malouf said. \"Our relationship was very close. From my perspective, he was like my little brother.\"Michael Altman, 50Michael Altman.Nick Altman describes his dad Michael, 50, as a selfless man who had a love for life, racquetball, and his family.\"He wasn't just my dad, he was my best friend, and I would tell him about everything,\" Nick said. \"Every success I had I would grab my phone or drive by to see him, every troubling situation, I spoke to him right away.\"Michael would text his son twice a day to check in, once in the morning and once at night. The morning after the collapse, the chilling silence of his phone told Altman something was wrong.Altman told CNN his dad was a dual citizen and came to the US from Costa Rica when he was 4, and the condo on the 11th floor of the building had been in their family since the 1980's when it was built.Michael was a champion racquetball player in his younger days, according to Altman, and shared that gift with his two sons, who frequently let him use his skills against them.\"Playing racquetball with my dad is one of my favorite memories,\" Altman said. \"He taught me and my brother Jeffery how to play racquetball and playing games of 21 trying to beat him ... we never beat him once.\"Michael was also a great friend to his neighbors in the complex; Nick said several survivors have asked for him. \"He's just a one-of-a-kind guy, no one can ever replace him or be like him in my life, I've never met someone as lovable as him,\" Altman said.Michael is survived by his sons, his parents Anita and Allen, and his sister Debbie.Antonio Lozano, 82, and Gladys Lozano, 80Antonio and Gladys LozanoAt a time when Gladys and Antonio Lozano's family would have been planning for their 59th wedding anniversary celebration next month, their son Sergio was faced with preparing for their funeral.  The Lozanos lived on the ninth floor of Champlain Towers South. Antonio had been living out his dream of life on a beach.Sergio Lozano had dinner with his parents hours before the collapse, he told CNN's Randi Kaye. After dinner, he hugged and kissed his parents. \"That was it,\" he said.The son said he returned to his condo in another tower, just two blocks away.He woke up at 1:30 a.m. when he heard what sounded like a tornado.Sergio Lozano recalled that he could once see his parents' kitchen from his apartment. Now it was gone.  \"I could see my mom cooking ... when night would fall,\" he said. \"Their kitchen, where my dad would sit and watch TV, it wasn't there.\" Sergio Lozano said he held onto hope they would be found alive in the hours after the collapse. But the couple died in bed, where their bodies were found, authorities would tell their son.\"That's the end of the romantic story,\" he said. \"They were together.\"  Their love story spanned nearly 60 years. They met in Cuba when they were just 12. Antonio migrated to the US first. He then sent for Gladys. They married on Miami Beach. The Lozanos leave two children, seven grandchildren and two great grandchildren. Gladys was godmother to Phil Ferro, chief meteorologist for CNN affiliate WSVN. Antonio was Ferro's uncle.\"They were such beautiful people,\" Ferro wrote on social media. \"May they Rest in Peace.\"Sergio Lozano said his parents often joked about who might die first.\"My dad would say to my mom, 'If you die, I don't even know how to fry an egg. I'm going to die,'\" he recalled. \"And my mom would say that if my dad would die, 'I don't even know how to pay the bills,' and I always told my mom, 'Don't worry, I'll go and do it.'\"\"But they died together,\" Sergio Lozano added. \"It's not fair -- being crushed, being destroyed. It's not fair.\"The couple perished in the collapse, along with all their possessions. Sergio Lozano bought a new dress and suit in which to bury his parents. Manuel LaFont, 54Manuel LaFont and Adriana LaFont.Adriana LaFont says the memories of their time together between walls that no longer stand will be forever engraved in her heart.

Manny LaFont, as he was known to family and friends, was a Houston native and a graduate of Sharpstown High School, family members told the station.\"My kids were born there,\" Adriana LaFont said of the condo she shared with her former husband. \"They learned how to swim in that pool. We had birthday parties, first communions, baptisms. So many memories.\"Days after the collapse, Adriana LaFont wrote an emotional post on Facebook, along with photos of the many special moments the family shared at the condo complex. \"So many memories within the walls that are no longer there will forever be engraved in the heart!,\" she  wrote. \"My Manny, who was my partner for so many years, father of my children, who scolds me and loves me at the same time. Adriana be on time!! Adriana don't change the plans!! Adriana, Adriana...\"She added, \"Manny, Daddy, we want to hug you again and tell you how much we love you!\"Ana Ortiz, 46; Luis Berm\u00fadez Jr., 26; Frank Kleiman, 55 Ana Ortiz, Luis Andres Bermudez, Frankie Kleiman.Luis Berm\u00fadez and his mother, Ana Ortiz, were confirmed as victims of the collapse on Sunday.Ortiz's sister Nicole said the agony of waiting for news of their fate is indescribable. \"I screamed,\" she told CNN's Ryan Young. \"I've almost fainted. I've cried.\"  Nicole Ortiz said she turned to her faith for help. She said she asked God for a miracle on the third day after the collapse. \"You always have the hope that a miracle could happen,\" Nicole Ortiz said. \"For me, a miracle happened. I asked God that it happen on the third day ... On the third day my sister and my nephew were found and the agony of the waiting stopped.\"She asked for prayers that the wait also ends for other families. If she could, Nicole Ortiz said, she would climb the rubble herself to help with the search.She described her big sister as her \"protector\" and \"a great mom\" who gave her son -- who had muscular dystrophy -- \"the best days of his life.\"\"They were all happy,\" she said of Ana Ortiz, Berm\u00fadez and Kleiman.   Berm\u00fadez studied graphic design and created a t-shirt line called Saucy Boyz Clothing.A tag on one of his shirts reads: \"Despite the poor mobility of my hands and fingers because of my muscular dystrophy -- I have achieved my dream because of my attitude.\"\"There are no limits,\" the tag says. \"The perspective with which you look at things, at life and at the world, can be the key to you success.\"His father and Ana Ortiz's former partner, Luis Berm\u00fadez, remembered his son in a Facebook post.\"Luiyo of my life, I miss you with every beat of my heart.

Eiglarsh went on to say that Kleiman was \"just filled with love and happiness and joy and gratitude before we learned that that really was what life's about.\"Stacie Fang, 54Stacie Fang.The first victim of the Surfside building collapse to be identified was 54-year-old Stacie Fang. She is the mother of Jonah Handler, the boy who was pulled from the rubble alive, her family said in a statement.\"There are no words to describe the tragic loss of our beloved Stacie,\" the Fang and Handler family statement said. \"The members of the Fang and Handler family would like to express our deepest appreciation for the outpouring of sympathy, compassion and support we have received. The many heartfelt words of encouragement and love have served as a much needed source of strength during this devastating time.\"Hilda Noriega, 92Hilda Noriega.Michael Noriega said his 92-year-old grandmother had been living in the building for 20 years.\"She's just so vibrant, full of energy, extremely independent. She's probably the most popular person that I know, just tons of friends,\" he said. \"And she lives her life with her faith first, her family, second, and her friends, third.\"The North Bay Village Government, on behalf of the Noriega family, tweeted that Hilda Noriega perished in the collapse.\"It is with great sadness that we announce the tragic passing of Hilda Noriega, the mother of Police Chief Carlos Noriega.\"The family expressed their gratitude to first responders and local and state leaders. \"The Noriegas have lost their 'heart and soul' and 'matriarch' of their family, but we will get through this time by embracing the unconditional love Hilda was known for.\"Michael Noriega said his father rushed to the site as soon as they heard about the collapse.

They have their significant others here supporting them, too,\" Felszer said. \"I'm embarrassed almost to even admit it: We thought we had the perfect family.\"Ilan \"was a 21-year-old young adult. Bright. Everywhere he went, he made an impact,\" his father said, adding that his son is a physics major at University of Chicago.Richard Augustine, 77In the days after the collapse, Debbie Hill told CNN's Erin Burnett that her 77-year-old father, who was on one of the top floors of the building, was missing.\"Not knowing is the big issue,\" Hill said.That changed after Miami-Dade officials confirmed Richard Augustine was among the victims confirmed dead.Hill previously told CNN that her father \"was in air freight sales most of his life.\"\"He had a lot of friends throughout the country, throughout the world. He loved what he did, he enjoyed fishing, he liked to travel,\" she said. \"He was just getting ready to retire.\"\"He was going to be training somebody that's replacing him in the fall and then we got the phone call and everything in our world changed,\" Hill said.Julio Cesar Velasquez, Angela Maria Velasquez and Theresa VelasquezJulio Cesar Velasquez and Angela Velasquez were confirmed dead in the collapse by Miami-Dade officials.After the collapse, their son, David Velasquez, had posted on Facebook that his parents, 66 and 60, respectively, lived in the building. His sister Theresa Velasquez, 36, was visiting her parents and staying with them at the time. Her body was recovered July 8 and she was identified July 17.David Velasquez's wife confirmed that the three were missing in a text message to CNN. She said the family requests privacy at this time.Judy Spiegel Judy Spiegel.Kevin Spiegel, who lived in Champlain Towers with his wife, Judy, said he was on a business trip in California when the building collapsed. When he woke up in the middle of the night, he had an emergency notice on his phone, he told CNN's Anderson Cooper, and he notified the rest of his family. \"We're very hopeful that the community here will be able to find our loved ones,\" said Josh Spiegel, Judy's son, who lives in Orlando.\"My mom is an absolutely amazing person,\" Josh Spiegel said. \"She's a fighter, and she fights for every single one of us, and we won't stop ... fighting until we find her,\" he said.Judy Spiegel was identified among the dead Monday, July 12.Her daughter, Rachel Spiegel, last received a text from her mother around 9 p.m. Wednesday, June 23 -- roughly four and a half hours before the collapse, she told CNN.That text was about a princess dress that Judy ordered for one of Rachel's daughters. The family has been Judy's main focus, Rachel said.Judy has a bond with her grandchildren, and \"the other kids that we hang out with, they love Grandma Judy -- everybody calls her Grandma Judy,\" Rach",

        "content": "(CNN)Baby pictures. Toys. Photo albums. Passports. These are just a few of the items found by the search teams at the site of the collapsed Surfside, Florida, condo building that drove home the immensity of what they were doing, one crew member said.The crews at the site work 12-hour shifts, many sleeping in tents nearby instead of going home. The effort has paused only briefly -- for lightning and the demolition of what had remained standing of the complex -- since the building pancaked in the early hours of June 24.And while the physical work in the South Florida heat can be grueling, the mental toll can be just as great. \"I feel like I'm physically digging, but I'm also emotionally digging for more strength to continue,\" Chief Nichole Notte of the Florida Task Force 2 told CNN. Rescue teams withstand wind, lightning and heat on 12-hour shifts to search for the victims of the Florida building collapseAnd then the enormity of the task pushes her on.Read More\"I bring back into mind the families and friends that want some closure, and are just desperately waiting for any information. And that gives me the strength and motivation to keep digging,\" Notte said. Notte has been at the site since 45 minutes after the collapse, with just one brief respite at home. There are several times every day when scale of the tragedy hits her. \"Some of them are sparked by the things that I find out there. If I find a baby pictures,\" Notte said. \"I think the first time it really hit me was when I found a passport with a baby in it. And then I found the entire family of passports in there as well. Those are the moments that I take a deep breath and kind of, I'm very in my head, in that moment.\"The hardest day, Notte said, was finding the body of the daughter of a Miami firefighter, 7-year-old Stella Cattarossi.Notte and her search and rescue partner, Dig.\"Everything shut down when we found her,\" Notte said. \"We all lined up. And you could hear a pin drop on a construction site, which is just eerie, and amazing and beautiful all in one.\"\"I have visions of them carrying her down the line of firefighters and first responders, and everyone just so intently, seeing reality,\" the chief said.\"It's always harder when it's personal. And that was very personal for us.\"Notte is a veteran of this kind of work, with years spent at the Broward County Sheriff's Office and the Florida Task Force II. She was featured, along with her search and rescue dog named Dig,  on the Broward County Sheriff's Office Facebook page  on June 27. \"Battalion Chief Notte will rest, sometimes cry, shore up her strength, and she and Dig will return to work, searching for signs of life,\" the office wrote. This deployment has been different from other assignments, Notte said, for one heartbreaking reason. \"I don't think there's been one deployment that we haven't saved somebody,\" she said. \"That's been really hard for us. I mean, we would love to even just say, like, we saved somebody's dog, I mean anything.\"\"And it's just been so challenging to not hear somebody say, 'Hey, thanks a lot for helping me out of that.' Not that we need thanks -- that's not what I meant by that -- but to shake the hand of a victim would be nice.\"A son's unanswered text message, two sisters buried together, a newlywed couple and a 60-year-old love story: What we know about the collapse victimsInstead, 79 bodies have been recovered from the site, and 61 people are unaccounted for as of Friday night. And midweek, the effort turned from a search and rescue operation to a search and recovery effort, meaning there was no longer hope of finding survivors. Everyone working at the site has moments when they need emotional support to deal with the task, Notte said. \"The way that each person gets it might be different, it will look differently,\" Notte said. \"Sometimes it's different for me, sometimes I just want to hug. Sometimes I just want to scream. Sometimes I want to cry. And I've gone through all those, I probably go through all those each day that I'm here.\"But, she said, the team members have one another. \"I feel so honored and privileged to be a part of the scene of such a group, such a hard-working group, and we can also rely on each other like a family relies on each other,\" she said.

        "content": "Surfside, Florida (CNN)The death toll in a condo building collapse in Surfside, Florida, has risen to 64, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said, after authorities made the decision to shift the search effort from rescue to recovery. 'The lack of survivors' has been the hardest part of condo collapse search operation, captain says Four more victims were recovered Thursday, Levine Cava said. The Miami-Dade Police Department also identified five additional victims Thursday evening: Juan Alberto Mora Jr., 32; Andrea Cattarossi, 56; Ruslan Manashirov, 36; Harold Rosenberg, 52; and Gloria Machado, 71. All were recovered recovered from the rubble Wednesday.Seventy-six people are \"potentially unaccounted for,\" the mayor said at a news conference Thursday afternoon, two weeks after the Champlain Towers South condo building collapse, which is among the deadliest mass casualty building collapses in US history, not including acts of terror or fires.A total of 200 people have been accounted for, 40 have been identified, and of those, 39 families have been notified, Levine Cava said.Authorities transitioned to search and recovery at midnight overnight, after determining \"the viability of life in the rubble\" was low, Miami-Dade County Fire Chief Alan Cominsky said Wednesday. Read MoreA worker walks away from the remains of the collapsed condo building on July 8.Still, Levine Cava said the recovery effort is \"proceeding just as rapidly with just as many people on the pile,\" and authorities are \"taking as much care as ever\" to find victims. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been scanning the collapse site twice a day and \"flying drones to collect essential imaging that will support the fact-finding process,\" Levine Cava said. So far, NIST has tagged 182 specimens. Levine Cava told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that victim families have been meeting with NIST and other experts and understand the need to transition from rescue to recovery. \"They understood there was no more hope or possibility of finding someone alive,\" she said. \"So they are just now waiting for closure, they're waiting to have a chance to find the victims and put this to rest.\" Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett said that a representative from the fire department told the families \"the Miami-Dade Fire Department will not stop working until they've gotten to the bottom of the pile and recovered every single one of the family's missing loved ones.\"\"The speaker further said that 'I can assure you, we are not stopping. And your missing children are coming back to your family,'\" Burkett said. How to help Surfside victimsA moment of silenceSearch and recovery teams paused work around 1:20 a.m. to honor the victims, the mayor said. At the edge of the rubble, first responders, officials, faith leaders and journalists bowed their heads for a moment of silence Wednesday evening, honoring those who lost their lives under the debris. The scene was largely monochromatic: gray concrete, gray dry wall, gray rebar and gray dust still on the paws of a search dog who stood at attention for the moment of silence. A college student, the daughter of a Miami firefighter, a family of four: What we know about the collapse victimsBut color could be found just around the corner, where a makeshift shrine adorned the fence of a tennis court with flowers, photos and a sign that read, \"Miami-Dade Search and Rescue mourns with you.\"Faith leaders offered prayers, and at one point an impromptu religious procession unfolded as sisters in brown robes lit candles and marched with a priest holding a statue of Our Lady of Fatima. Some of the families who lost loved ones were brought to the site Thursday for a visit at their request, Levine Cava said. \"We held a moment of silence with our first responders. They paused their work on the pile briefly to honor the victims and their families and they received an aerial salute by Miami-Dade County Police Department,\" the mayor said. A man places flowers at the memorial that includes pictures of some of the victims.Each victim recovered is \"handled with extreme care and compassion,\" Levine Cava said in Thursday's news conference. Faith leaders, including rabbis, have been embedded with search and recovery workers and they're working with police to handle the remains of Jewish victims in a way that's consistent with their faith, she said.\"We have a tent designated on-site and when a Jewish body is discovered, a prayer is performed and specific protocols are followed to honor both the faith traditions and the integrity of the investigation,\" Levine Cava said.Authorities are also collecting all manner of personal items, like legal or identifying documents, photos, wallets and credit cards, cell phone and tablets. Any currency, firearms and safes are also being set aside.The way the building collapsed gave people inside the lowest probability of survival, Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Assistant Fire Chief of Operations Raide Jadallah said Wednesday, referring to it as a \"pancake.\"\"The other factors that we have to include, you know, the fact that we did not get in the alert (from) a K-9, a sensor trip forward, sound, and any visual utilizing our cameras. The last known alert that we received was in the initial hours the day of the collapse,\" Jadallah said.Members of search and rescue teams gather for a moment of silence and prayer at the memorial to the victims in the collapsed 12-story Champlain Towers South condo building.Surfside urges condos to hire engineers, inspect foundations Condo associations in Surfside will soon receive letters signed by the town mayor advising them to take steps to give residents confidence their buildings are safe. The Town of Surfside shared a copy of the letter with CNN. It provides recommendations for all buildings east of Collins Avenue, regardless of the age of the building, including retaining a structural engineer to review structural drawings and perform a basement review, as well as a geotechnical engineer to review the foundation.\"The recommendations are made in an abundance of caution based on the current status of the investigation,\" the letter said. \"They are intended to serve as an interim methodology to afford residents some peace of mind until the forensic investigation progresses further.\"Rescue teams withstand wind, lightning and heat on 12-hour shifts to search for the victims of the Florida building collapseThe town hired Allyn Kilsheimer of KCE Engineering, a structural engineering firm, to lead the investigation into what caused the collapse. The investigation is ongoing, per the letter.City and county officials have launched audits and inspections of residential condo buildings in the surrounding areas, and so far, three have generated concern.One in Miami-Dade County had an issue with four balconies. Another in Miami Beach required the evacuation of a three-story building.The largest impact has been in North Miami Beach, where all 156 units of Crestview Towers south were evacuated Friday after officials there said the building was deemed structurally and electrically unsafe. According to an inspection report by Miami-Dade Fire Rescue, the building, built in 1972, has 18 pending code violations, various fines and liens.Eyes are also on the collapsed structure's sister building, Champlain Towers North, which Burkett has previously described as \"substantially the same\" as Chaplain Towers South, with \"the same construction, the same developer, the same name, probably the same materials.\"On Thursday, Burkett told reporters that experts are collecting samples of concrete from Champlain Towers North to look for potential salt contamination, \"which can significantly compromise the structure.\" Photos: Deadly condo collapse near MiamiExcavators dig through the remains from the Champlain Towers South building on July 9.Hide Caption 1 of 58 Photos: Deadly condo collapse near MiamiWooden hearts with victims' names have been put up at the memorial site near the building's remains.Hide Caption 2 of 58 Photos: Deadly condo collapse near MiamiNuns from the St. Joseph's Catholic Church pray at the memorial site on July 7.Hide Caption 3 of 58 Photos: Deadly condo collapse near MiamiA member of a search team moves rubble at the site on July 7.

In Florida, they can produce a report on a topic that does not necessarily pair with criminal charges.In the heap of concrete and twisted steel, the imprint of lives lost, memories and dashed hopeReports of damage to the building, cracks in the concrete and disputes over repair work have surfaced in the weeks since the collapse. And while they have prompted speculation about a potential cause, officials have said they have not identified a single trigger for the collapse.A new detail emerged Wednesday via a police report released by the town of Surfside to CNN, which disclosed a car crash in the basement garage in 2016 caused visible damage to a cement pole.The driver of a BMW sedan said he \"accidentally hit the accelerator instead of the brake\" before crashing into a second car and then the pole, according to the report filed just after the crash.A crash in the garage has been among the theories floated by engineers reviewing the collapse as a possible contributing factor, and the 2016 accident, which has not been previously reported, would likely be another piece of evidence considered by investigators. But engineers who spoke to CNN cautioned it could be insignificant, especially considering when it took place. \"I would think that if the vehicle impacting the column was a factor, that you would usually find that within close proximity to the time of the accident,\" said Richard Slider, a structural engineer who consults on building construction.CNN has reached out to a spokesman for the building's condominium board for comment and the town for more information. CNN's David Shortell, Rosa Flores, John Couwels and Gregory Lemos contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Dozens of condominiums in a Surfside, Florida, residential tower were destroyed when part of the building collapsed early Thursday. At least four people were killed and 159 people are unaccounted for, Miami-Dade County officials said Friday morning.A search and rescue operation is underway after one side of the building fell to the ground for reasons that remain under investigation. Here is what we know about the building and surrounding area:Address: 8777 Collins AvenueRead MoreBuilt: 1981Stories: 13 (the building stands about 160 feet tall)Residences: The oceanfront building contained 136 one-, two- and three-bedroom units, according to real estate records. Most are between 1,200 and 2,243 square feet.      Price: Most condos range from $295,000 (for a one-bedroom in March 2020) to $980,000 (for a three-bedroom a year later), real estate records indicate. A four-bedroom penthouse spanning more than 4,500 square feet sold for almost $2.9 million earlier this year.Other amenities: In addition to housing, the building offered terraces, a club room, tennis courts, fitness center, sauna, private beach, heated swimming pool, underground parking deck and 24-hour security. Inspection: A study last year showed signs the building was sinking at a rate of about 2 millimeters a year between 1993 and 1999, said Shimon Wdowinski, a professor with Florida International University's Institute of Environment. Sinking was unique to the area of Champlain Towers South, not surrounding buildings, he said. Buildings in nearby western Miami Beach, which was built on reclaimed wetlands, were moving at higher rates, \"so we didn't think it was something unusual,\" he said. While the sinking alone likely would not cause the tower's collapse, it could be a contributing factor because \"if one part of the building moves with respect to the other, that could cause some tension and cracks,\" Wdowinski said. Over the last several months, the building has undergone \"thorough engineering inspections\" in preparation for its 40-year certification, said Kenneth Direktor, an attorney for the condo tower residents' association, and \"nothing like this was foreseeable.\" Ongoing construction: At the time of the collapse, the building was undergoing work on its concrete roof, Burkett said, but it's unclear whether the work was a factor in the collapse. Work was being done to meet \"40-year standards,\" a strengthening of the building code -- regarding updates and improvements -- enacted following Hurricane Andrew in 1992, Miami-Dade County Commissioner Sally Heyman said. An engineer who inspected the building determined it needed repairs, but the only repair underway was the replacement of the roof, Direktor said. It was the attorney's understanding the engineer was helping the city investigate the collapse, he said.

        "content": "(CNN)Officials are considering demolishing the rest of the Champlain Towers South as operations continue in sections that crumbled to the ground a week ago, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said Thursday evening. Work on the debris was halted for much of the day as engineers assessed the structure still standing. Levine Cava told reporters at an evening news conference the operation resumed about 4:45 p.m. \"Given our ongoing safety concerns about the integrity of the building we're continuing to restrict access to the collapse zone,\" she said.Engineers are conducting ongoing testing and evaluations of the site to expand the search into more areas as it becomes safe to do so, she said. Miami-Dade Fire Chief Alan Cominsky said crews were working in three of nine grids.The mayor said officials need to make the dgecision about a \"likely\" demolition \"extremely carefully and methodically,\" taking into consideration the impact it could have on the existing pile of rubble.Read MoreFOLLOW LIVE UPDATESScott Nacheman, a structure specialist with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said they will evaluate technical data and stakeholder information and pass along the findings to officials. He said it could be weeks before demolition occurs.But State Fire Marshal Jimmy Patronis said the demolition \"might be sooner than we're anticipating.\"He said they were bringing in heavier equipment that creates potential complications to the weight that keeps the still-standing sections in place.\"The timing of it is still yet to be determined, but in order to complete what it takes, in order to finish the mission, the building will have to go,\" he said. \"It's just too much of a risk.\"A young man with muscular dystrophy, a family here to get vaccinated: What we know about the collapse victimsEarlier in the day officials said there were concerns about the stability of the sections of the building that are still standing.\"Concern assessments included 6 to 12 inches of movement, and a large column hanging from the structure that could fall and cause damage to the support columns in the subterranean garage area,\" Cominsky said. Earlier Thursday, President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden met with the search and rescue personnel, first responders and some the families of the 145 people still unaccounted for. \"Unfortunately, I've done a lot of these circumstances where I've met with families who've had great loss,\" the President said after the three-hour meeting. \"And what amazed me with this group of people was the resilience, the absolute commitment, their willingness to do whatever it took.\" He added: \"I walked away impressed by their strength.\" The Bidens later visited a memorial wall near the collapse site where the first lady laid a bouquet of flowers.Tropical storm might impact areaOne more deceased victim was identified Thursday. Officials said Magaly Elena Delgado, 80, was recovered Wednesday.At least 18 people are confirmed to have been killed, including four members of one family.  Sisters Lucia Guara, 11, and Emma Guara, 4, were located Wednesday as was their mother, Anaely Rodriguez. Their father, Marcus Guara, was one of the first victims found.One of the girls was a student of Miami-Dade County Public Schools, the school district's superintendent Alberto Carvalho said. In total, 17 of Carvalho's students lived in the building; he has made contact with 15, and one remains unaccounted for, he said. Now, he says he prays their district won't have to mourn another student. \"The weight in my heart is unbearable,\" Carvalho told CNN.Video shows fallen debris and gushing water in the Surfside condo garage moments before collapseHoping to bring answers to the families of the missing, rescue teams have been working endlessly to break through 13 to 16 feet of the concrete that came crashing down as many residents slept. Almost 1,400 tons of building material has been removed from the site, Gov. Ron DeSantis said Thursday.Meanwhile, a new obstacle looms as Tropical Storm Elsa has formed in the Atlantic, with Surfside in its extended forecast cone. Division Director for Office of Emergency Management Charles Cirillo said the county faces the risk of heavy rainfall and strong winds from Elsa from Sunday night into Monday morning.Stories emerge of precious moments to escapeThe collapse happened in the early morning hours of June 24, and while some families have told miraculous stories of the mere seconds they had to process what was happening and escape, others spoke of the terror.Ashley Dean's sister, Cassie Stratton, is among the missing. Stratton called her husband to say the pool was collapsing and the ground was shaking, Dean told CNN.Stratton began to scream loudly, and then the phone went dead, Dean said.

She thought she had left the balcony door open, so she ran to close it. But then she saw the ceiling where a crack had begun to form, and from there things started coming down fast, she said. \"Something inside of me said run,\" she said. \"You have to run and save your life.\"Adriana Sarmiento and Roberto Castillero were staying at a hotel near the Champlain Towers South and just happened to record a video that shows debris and gushing water in the garage of the building minutes before it collapsed. The couple watched as people in the building rushed to their balconies, confused about the sound. Sarmiento and Castillero scrambled into the street, trying to wave for residents to evacuate, but they couldn't understand her, she said. Video they recorded after the collapse showed rubble and debris even as far as where they were standing after running back toward their hotel.They were in disbelief.\"I said, 'Where are the people on the balcony?'\" Castillero said. \"I did not realize that the balcony was not there.\"Condo association board member resignationsFive members of the condo association's seven-member board -- including its president, Anette Goldstein -- decided to resign in the fall of 2019, when the condo association was debating multimillion-dollar repairs, the Washington Post reported, citing board meeting minutes and Goldstein's resignation letter.The majority of the Champlain Towers board decided to quit following disputes over the lackluster response in tackling the repairs needed in the condominium complex, the paper reported.\"We work for months to go in one direction and at the very last minute objections are raised that should have been discussed and resolved right in the beginning,\" Goldstein wrote in her September 2019 resignation letter that was obtained by the Post. The resignations took place about 11 months after the structural field survey report, which detailed \"extensive and necessary repairs,\" according to the firm that performed the survey, Morabito Consultants. Goldstein's letter appears to indicate growing frustration in trying to resolve the issue and pay for the repairs, which were estimated to be about $9 million in 2018.  Condo owners in Surfside building were facing assessments for $15 million worth of repairsGoldstein and some of the others would later return to the board -- one of the members just three weeks after stepping down -- documents indicate, the Post reported.The paper said its efforts to reach almost everyone who had served on the board since 2018 were unsuccessful. Two of them are reported to be missing, according to the Post.The estimated cost for repairs had grown to about $15 million by the time the work was approved by the board in 2021, according to an assessment letter obtained by CNN. Those costs would be paid by the residents. Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported Lucia Guara's age.

Ron DeSantis, who toured the site with FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell this weekend.Biden spoke to DeSantis by phone at the end of last week.The President will look to recommendations from a federal safety panel as he steers the federal government's probe into what caused the collapse.Psaki told reporters on Tuesday Biden would use the board's findings to determine how infrastructure like residential towers can be better fortified against catastrophic failure.\"They have announced they sent a team of six scientists and engineers to collect firsthand information on the towers, on the Champlain Towers South collapse, that will be used to determine if an investigation or study will be conducted,\" Psaki said in response to a question from CNN's Allie Malloy. \"So, obviously that would be something the President would support and certainly we would look to that if that's a decision made to learn how we can help protect infrastructure across the country.\"The President issued an emergency declaration to authorize federal assistance and on Friday said his administration was doing everything in its power to be of assistance to those affected.The cause of the collapse is still unknown, but\u00a0a letter\u00a0sent months before the deadly collapse warned damage to the building was accelerating after\u00a0a 2018 report\u00a0raised concerns about structural damage.Biden spent the weekend with family at Camp David but officials said the President received briefings each day over the phone and from a traveling national security adviser, Yohannes Abraham.Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett told CNN's John Berman on \"New Day\" that there are \"waves of men and women\" involved in the search and rescue effort of the collapsed building.\u00a0He said there are concerns about falling debris at the site.\u00a0Criswell said Tuesday the devastation at the site is \"difficult to put into words.\" She praised local rescue efforts and also noted FEMA is on the ground and has a recovery center that is working with families and loved ones impacted by the collapse. \"Our hearts go out to all the families and loved ones that have been impacted by this event,\" Criswell said at a congressional hearing Tuesday.This story has been updated with additional information.",

Col. Golan Vach, commander of the Israeli National Rescue Unit, said that while this is the most difficult site he has ever worked, his team found new spaces in the rubble to search Monday and Tuesday.\"So there is still hope,\" Vach told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. \"Until one week, I have a solid hope that we will find someone. After one week, it's minor.\"Read MoreThe building partially collapsed in the middle of the night last Thursday.Vach's team comprises 15 engineers, search and rescue experts and others. He said he's never seen a collapse like this one.\"This building collapsed very, very badly, if I can use this word, because it collapsed into itself,\" he said. \"And the bedrooms that we are looking for, because the people (slept) in the bedrooms, are under 4 or 5 meters (13 to 16 feet) of concrete.\" The latest on the partial building collapse near MiamiRescuers will continue to consider the unaccounted-for as \"missing until they are found,\" Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a news conference late Tuesday morning.\"Nobody is giving up hope here. Nobody is stopping,\" Surfiside Mayor Charles Burkett said at the same news conference.\n\n\n\nListen: \"It almost resembles the Trade Center\"\n\n\n            A first responder tells dispatch that he has arrived on scene of a\n            13 story building with most of the building gone in dispatch audio\n            published on Broadcastify.\n        \n\n\n\nOfficials acknowledged that conditions at the site are challenging for emergency workers. Burkett told CNN's John Berman earlier on Tuesday that debris had fallen overnight Monday into Tuesday from portions of the building that remain standing.Additionally, workers are steering clear of a \"45-foot area next to the building\" because of concerns about overhanging debris from the standing portion, Miami-Dade Fire Chief Alan Cominsky said Tuesday.More than 3 million pounds of concrete have been removed during the rescue operation, Cominsky said.A six-person team of federal officials from the National Institute of Standards and Technology -- consisting of scientists, structural engineers and a geotechnical engineer -- is conducting a preliminary investigation of the collapsed building's materials, history and applicable building codes at the time the condo was built, the ground surrounding the building and numerous other factors, according to an agency official.The White House announced President Joe Biden planned to be in Surfside on Thursday to visit with victims' families and first responders.People join together in a community twilight vigil on the beach for those lost and missing during the partially collapsed Champlain Towers South condo building Monday.April 2021 letter said damage 'has gotten significantly worse'As investigators converge on the scene, questions are being asked about the building's structural integrity.Letter sent months before deadly Florida collapse warned damage to condo building was acceleratingAn April 2021 letter from the condo's board president to residents said some damage observed in a 2018 engineer's report, including in the garage, \"has gotten significantly worse.\"\"The concrete deterioration is accelerating. The roof situation got much worse, so extensive roof repairs had to be incorporated,\" the letter from board President Jean Wodnicki reads.Wodnicki further described issues facing the building: \"When you can visually see the concrete spalling (cracking), that means that the rebar holding it together is rusting and deteriorating beneath the surface.\"CNN has reached out to representatives of the condominium association for further comment.The 2018 report from an engineering firm documented severe structural damage to the concrete slab below the pool deck and \"cracking and spalling\" located in the parking garage. Spalling is a term used to describe areas of concrete that have cracked or crumbled.The 2021 letter sought to explain a  $15 million assessment that condo owners were to pay for repairs to the building, with payments set to begin July 1. The association approved the assessment in April to complete repairs required under the county's 40-year recertification process, according to documents obtained by CNN.Condo owners in Surfside building were facing assessments for $15 million worth of repairsBuilding residents also had raised concerns over tremors during construction of a nearby building in 2019, according to documents obtained by CNN and interviews with the family members of people missing in the collapse.   The 2018 report didn't say whether the structure was at risk of collapse. Donna DiMaggio Berger, an attorney for the condominium board, told CNN's Chris Cuomo on Monday that she didn't think the building was in a state of disrepair prior to its collapse.\"We have months and years to dig into what happened, and we're going to. The board is already in the process of hiring an engineer to also try to figure out what happened, and they will be evaluating who's responsible.\"While there are no clear answers on the cause, early signs point to some failure in the lower reaches of the 13-story building, perhaps in its foundation, columns or underground parking garage, experts have told CNN.

It's the third lawsuit to be filed against the condo association.Another lawsuit has been filed against condo association after the deadly collapse in SurfsideThe lawsuit was filed on Monday on behalf of Raysa Rodriguez, a resident who lives on the ninth floor of the building, as well as other residents. The suit states the condominium association had the duty to maintain the building in a safe condition and good working order.  \"Despite the obvious duties required by Florida law, and this admitted duty of care by the Association's Declaration and other governing documents, Defendant, through their own reckless and negligent conduct, caused a catastrophic deadly collapse of Champlain Towers South in Surfside,\" the complaint alleges.   In filing the complaint, Rodriguez is seeking class action status to represent all of the people who were affected by the tragedy, and is asking the court to help preserve any materials so everyone who is to blame can be held responsible. CNN's calls to the Champlain Towers South Condominium Association seeking comment on the lawsuit have not been returned. Mayor: County building audit already has uncovered serious issuesBecause of the collapse, a building audit is underway across the county, and that audit has already uncovered serious issues, said Mayor Daniella Levine Cava.Resident of collapsed Florida building says he's alive only because girlfriend persuaded him to stay with her \"Just last night, our building officer notified one of those properties, a building in northeast Dade, that four balconies must be immediately closed to residents due to safety conditions,\" Levine Cava said at Tuesday morning's news conference.\"We're taking swift action to immediately identify and address any outstanding issues with the buildings that have not yet completed their 40-year certification process -- that's our priority right now,\" she said.Levine Cava says she expects all issues the audit turns up will be addressed in a matter of weeks. Families and friends are waiting for answersOf the 12 people known to have died, 11 have been publicly identified. They were Stacie Fang, 54, Antonio Lozano, 82, Gladys Lozano, 80, Manuel LaFont, 54, Leon Oliwkowicz, 80, Luis Bermudez, 26,  Anna Ortiz, 46, Christina Beatriz Elvira, 74,  Marcus Joseph Guara, 52, Frank Kleiman, 55 and Michael David Altman, 50.Family members of those still unaccounted for are waiting for any answers they can get as the search continues. A person adds flowers Monday to a memorial that has pictures of some of the missing from the partially collapsed Champlain Towers South condo building in Surfside.Rachel Spiegel, whose mother Judy Spiegel is unaccounted for, said it's been difficult to relay to Rachel's 4-year-old daughter what has been happening. Rachel told her daughter that there was an accident in the building, and that \"grandma is missing.\"How to help Surfside building collapse victims\"And she told me, 'I can go get her. ... I know where she hides. I'm really good at finding her,'\" Rachel Spiegel told CNN on Tuesday morning. \"When she's telling me that, I'm ... crying even more, but at the same time trying to keep my composure because I don't want my 4-year-old to worry too much.\"\"I hope my mom is alive ... but we also are very aware of the reality of the situation and the time -- I mean, it's Day 6. And the fact that they aren't finding people is of tremendous concern,\" Rachel Spiegel said.Shelly Angle, whose friend Elaine Sabino lived on the building's top floor and has not been found, said it's \"hard to stay composed.\" Angle said she is holding onto \"the glimmer of hope that just maybe somebody survived.\"Ronit Felszer and Carlos Naibryf told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on Monday that they are being realistic about the possible outcome.Carlos Naibryf said his son, Ilan Naibryf, \"was a 21-year-old young adult. Bright. Everywhere he went, he made an impact ... now he's at U. Chicago, physics major.\" When Camerota asked the parents if they're sill believing in a miracle, Felszer shook her head. \"We want to believe in a miracle because we still don't have the physical presence, in part or in whole, of our son,\" she said. \"A miracle can come, yes, but we have to be very realistic,\" the father told CNN.CNN's Amanda Watts, Tina Burnside, Curt Devine, Deanna Hackney, Jamiel Lynch, Hannah Sarisohn, Rebekah Riess, Rosa Flores and Camille Furst contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)The remaining portion of the Champlain Towers South condo building in Surfside, Florida, was demolished just after 10:30 p.m. ET Sunday.Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava told CNN in a briefing Sunday night that once the area has been deemed secure following the building's demolition, search and rescue teams will resume their efforts on the debris pile. The damaged remaining structure at the Champlain Towers South condo building collapses in a controlled demolition, Sunday in Surfside, Florida.Search efforts at the partially collapsed building were paused Saturday around 4 p.m. so engineers could secure the site and prepare for the demolition, which officials said was crucial to allowing authorities to continue to look for survivors safely, eliminating the threat posed by the part of the structure that was still standing. \"As soon as the building is down and once the site is deemed secure, we will have our first responders back on the pile to immediately resume their work,\" Levine Cava said Sunday night.She called the method of demolition \"energetic felling,\" describing it as a process that \"uses small, strategically placed explosives and relies on gravity to bring the building down in place.\" Read MoreThe demolition was planned to be confined to the immediate area around the building, but nearby residents were asked to stay indoors as a precautionary measure, the mayor said, citing the dust and other particles that will be an \"unavoidable byproduct\" of the demolition. Officials have been racing against Tropical Storm Elsa, which is tracking toward South Florida with heavy rain and sustained winds of 60 mph. The demolition team continued its preparations Sunday -- the 11th day since approximately 55 of the building's 136 units collapsed early June 24, killing at least 24 people. There are 121 people who remain unaccounted for. Those who died include 4- and 10-year-old sisters, an elderly couple and the daughter of a firefighter.Nicole Mejias told CNN on Saturday that five of her family members were in the Champlain Towers South building when it collapsed, including 7-year-old Stella Cattarossi, the daughter of the Miami firefighter. Cattarossi's body was found Thursday night.\"We just miss them so much already, we wish this tragedy didn't happen, and will always remember them,\" Mejias said.A family of four, a 60-year love story, a young man with muscular dystrophy: What we know about the collapse victimsAppearing on Sunday's \"Face the Nation\" on CBS, Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett underscored that authorities are still working with the mindset that this remains a rescue effort. \"It is absolutely not a recovery effort,\" Burkett said, later adding, \"There is nobody in charge really talking about stopping this rescue effort. And this rescue effort, as far as I'm concerned, will go on until everybody is pulled out of that debris.\"Burkett said at Sunday's briefing his team was tasked with altering their operational approach around the collapsed structure as Tropical Storm Elsa moved closer.\"It appears as though the approaching storm may have been a blessing in disguise for us in that it initiated the demolition discussion,\" he said.Burkett said he hopes the demolition will eliminate a potentially dangerous threat to workers and possibly open up an estimated third of the remaining pile to search and rescue teams.\"We want to make sure that we control which way the building falls and not a hurricane, so all of this together I think ended up being a good thing,\" Burkett said.Demolition plans and a race against the stormFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for 15 counties Saturday -- including Miami-Dade County -- because of Tropical Storm Elsa.\"We're preparing for the risk of isolated tornadoes, storm surge, heavy rainfall and flash flooding,\" DeSantis said, adding the state has \"begun executing contingency plans for the Tropical Storm Elsa and Surfside co-response.\"  Photos: Deadly condo collapse near MiamiExcavators dig through the remains from the Champlain Towers South building on July 9.Hide Caption 1 of 58 Photos: Deadly condo collapse near MiamiWooden hearts with victims' names have been put up at the memorial site near the building's remains.Hide Caption 2 of 58 Photos: Deadly condo collapse near MiamiNuns from the St. Joseph's Catholic Church pray at the memorial site on July 7.Hide Caption 3 of 58 Photos: Deadly condo collapse near MiamiA member of a search team moves rubble at the site on July 7.

Elsa was a Category 1 hurricane Friday and early Saturday, but weakened to a tropical storm as it took aim at the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Forecasters say the storm's center will not directly impact Surfside, though the city could be affected by its outer bands, with wind gusts and rain starting in the area as early as Monday morning.The potential for weather-related issues at the collapse site influenced authorities' decisions on the ground, and Levine Cava said Saturday officials were hopeful the demolition could be done before the area felt Elsa's impacts. Plans to demolish the remaining portion of the building were announced late in the week as rescuers continued to scour the debris for victims. Search and rescue operations were briefly suspended Thursday after engineers noted shifting on the debris pile that posed a danger to the rescue crews, officials said. After operations resumed later that day, authorities confirmed a demolition would likely be necessary to keep rescue crews and the collapse site safe for further searches.  A cross hangs among wilting flowers at a makeshift memorial near Champlain Towers South.Sunday, the condominium board for Champlain Towers East, a sister building of Champlain Towers South, suggested its residents evacuate ahead of the demolition, according to a letter from the condo association's board of directors obtained by CNN. The letter said that while guidance had not been given yet, they were encouraging residents to evacuate in advance as streets nearby will be congested due to the demolition. They also asked residents to take their pets and valuables, including passports and valuable documents, with them.\"Our building foundation has been checked multiple times, but we make this suggestion in an abundance of caution,\" the letter said. \"We do not expect any impact to us but you can't be too careful under the circumstances.\"The firm Controlled Demolition, Inc. was tasked with the demolition of the remaining Champlain Towers South structure, Levine Cava said. The governor expressed his support for the demolition plan ahead of Elsa's impact and said Saturday he believed it would be best for the building to be down before the storm arrives. \"With these gusts potentially, it would create a really big hazard.\"Survivors unlikely to retrieve belongings before demolitionAs for the survivors, the demolition could mean forfeiting not only their homes but also their possessions. Those whose condos were not affected by the collapse had to evacuate without many of their belongings, leaving behind clothes, valuables and family photographs. But officials indicated it wasn't safe for them to go back inside to retrieve those items. 'Tragedy beyond tragedy': Champlain Towers South was a catastrophe in slow motion \"At this time we're told that the building is unsafe. People are not going into the building,\" Levine Cava told CNN on Friday when asked whether survivors could collect their belongings. \"I do not know how that could occur.\" Asked Sunday whether families of the victims would be able to recover items that belonged to those they lost, such as their clothes, Miami-Dade Police Director Alfredo Ramirez III said homicide detectives had been \"collecting items that are retrievable, and are logging them and documenting them at this time.\" Any type of heirloom that is safe to retrieve is being documented to \"be addressed at a later date with family members,\" he said. Additionally, a system has been set up for family members to report property they are looking for, Ramirez said. Officials have also done what they can to rescue any pets who might remain in the building ahead of the demolition. Sunday night, Levine Cava said Miami Dade Fire Rescue personnel had carried out several sweeps of the premises, searching closets and under beds, along with using thermal imaging drones to locate any animals. The latest information officials had was that no animals were left inside. \"Those who were forced to evacuate the remaining portion of the building left their entire lives behind,\" Levine Cava said. \"We know that. And we're deeply, deeply concerned and empathetic to how extraordinarily difficult this time is for them and their families.\" Miami Beach apartment building ordered to evacuate Amid the investigation into what caused the collapse, the nearby city of Miami Beach ordered the evacuation of a three-story residential building Saturday evening out of an abundance of caution, according to city spokesperson Melissa Berthier.The building is on Lenox Avenue and has 24 units, per Berthier. According to the city, 11 of the units are unoccupied and one person required housing assistance.This is at least the second building ordered to be evacuated in Miami-Dade County since Champlain Towers South collapsed. Crestview Towers in North Miami Beach was evacuated Friday.Firm held off on repairs because of stability issues in months before Surfside building collapseBerthier said Miami Beach fire teams responded to a service call Saturday about a vacant unit. When the city inspector arrived on the scene, he flagged a \"flooring system failure in that unit and excessive deflection on an exterior wall.\"The evaluation of the structural integrity of the building is ongoing, per Berthier.Separately, the city of Surfside has asked the owners of buildings more than 30 years old and more than three stories tall to assess their properties for recertification in advance of their traditional 40-year deadline. According to a memo obtained by CNN from a resident of the Champlain Towers East complex, Surfside building official James McGuinness asked those property owners -- especially those with structures on the ocean side of Collins Avenue -- to hire a Florida-registered geotechnical engineer to perform an analysis of the foundation and subsurface soils. The memo reminds owners it's their responsibility to do these recertifications and regularly maintain buildings. It also calls for a written action plan in response within 30 days of receiving the memo.CNN's Brian Todd, Natasha Chen, Kevin Conlon, Claudia Dominguez, Casey Tolan and Haley Brink contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)The city of North Miami Beach has ordered the immediate closure and evacuation of a condo building after a report submitted Friday determined the structure is unsafe, officials said.Crestview Towers, about seven miles north of the Surfside condo building that collapsed last week, was deemed to be structurally and electrically unsafe based on a delinquent recertification report for the almost 50-year-old building, said City Manager Arthur H. Sorey III. The report was dated January 11, 2021, and was submitted Friday, Sorey said. An engineer retained by the condominium  association concluded in the report that the building was structurally and electrically unsafe, Sorey said.Harold Dauphin, who said he lives in the building with his 7-year-old, told CNN that he first learned of the evacuations when he was picking up his child from camp. As he approached the residence, he said he saw helicopters flying above and police on the premises, going floor to floor, assisting with the evacuation procedures.Read More\"I mean, I understand the call, it's a great call, knowing what happened at Surfside, so it's better to be safe than sorry. It's unfortunate but it's the right call for the safety of others,\" Dauphin said. He added that he is disturbed that the building personnel didn't action sooner to make repairs. Dauphin estimated that his building has been under repairs for nearly three years. \"But if you do a walk around, you see some cracks in the walls and stuff like that they're supposedly fixing, trying to fix.  But again, nobody knew, I didn't know that the building was deemed unsafe since January,\" he said. \"It makes no sense. Six months later, oh you know it wasn't safe?\"Crestview, built in 1972, had not undergone the recertification process required for buildings 40 years old, according to Sorey.\"And that's what pushed us to push the issue of their compliance, and then that's when they submitted their report,\" the city manager said, adding a 30-day notice of closure was posted by the city yesterday. The condo's report was submitted to the city around 2 p.m. Friday, he said.The collapse of the Champlain Towers South in Surfside, Florida, last week prompted the city to launch a review of all high-rise condo buildings above five stories.Crestview has 156 units, Sorey said. The manager said he doesn't know how many residents the building has. The city is aiming to evacuate residents within two to three hours, but Sorey said it is likely to take all night. \"We know people are working jobs and second jobs, and we'll be here all night to help people get out,\" Sorey said.The city is working with the Red Cross to find temporary shelter for displaced residents who do not have a place to stay, he said. \"Nothing is more important than the safety and lives of our residents, and we will not rest until we ensure this building is 100% safe,\" Sorey said. CNN has reached out to Crestview's condominium association for comment. CNN's Aya Elamroussi contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)President Joe Biden, whose empathy amid loss is his chief political characteristic, traveled Thursday to console families in Florida enduring the excruciating search for loved ones inside a seaside condo that suddenly collapsed a week ago.\"Never give up hope,\" he told the anguished relatives of those still missing, who had gathered in a hotel ballroom to hear from a President whose own reckoning with grief has colored his personal and political lives. Later, Biden told reporters the families were \"going through hell\" as they question whether they'll ever be able to recover their loved ones' remains.The meeting with families was closed to the press, but some attendees posted about the event on social media. Biden, who spoke softly, had his words translated into Spanish.\"It used to drive me crazy when they'd say I know how you feel,\" he said, recounting the deaths of his wife, daughter and son -- losses that have punctuated his public life. \"And you know they meant well but you know they had no idea. None.\"He was speaking from experience. From the day in 1972 when he was sworn in as US senator at his sons' hospital bedside following a car crash that had killed his wife and daughter, Biden's persona been defined by grief. When one of those sons, Beau, died of a brain tumor in 2015, grief again came to color Biden's life. He wrestled with it publicly, including as he weighed a presidential run.Read More\"No matter what the outcome, the people you love, the people you may have lost, they're going to be with you always. Part of your soul. Part of who you are,\" Biden said as attendees' eyes filled with tears.\"Be patient with one another,\" he went on. \"Hang on. Hold on. I don't want you to feel like you're being sucked into a black hole in your chest. There's no way out. But there is.\"The devastating structural failure, which so far has resulted in 18 confirmed deaths with another 145 people still unaccounted for, could become the deadliest non-intentional building collapse in American history. It has raised new questions about the safety of high-rises that run for miles along the South Florida coast, along with similar developments across the nation. Biden, who was joined by first lady Jill Biden in Florida, declined to speculate on the cause of the disaster and said there was no \"definitive judgment as to why it collapsed.\" He is awaiting findings from a team of six federal scientists and engineers collecting information on the ground. He hopes to use results from their investigation to determine how infrastructure like residential towers can be better fortified against catastrophic failure, according to officials.But before then, there are grieving families to comfort and exhausted rescue personnel to thank -- a presidential responsibility Biden takes as seriously as any.\"The waiting,\" Biden told the families, \"the waiting is unbearable.\"US President Joe Biden(R) shakes hands with Jimmy Patronis, Florida's Chief Financial Officer, as he meets with first responders to the collapse of the 12-story Champlain Towers South condo building in Surfside, during a meeting with them in Miami Beach, Florida, July 1, 2021. - President Joe Biden flew to Florida on Thursday to \"comfort\" families of people killed or still missing in the rubble of a beachfront apartment building, where hopes of finding survivors had all but evaporated.

(Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)Before he departed Florida, Biden and the first lady stopped at a stretch of chain-link fence, where families have placed flowers, homemade signs and candles near the site of the collapse. The President made a sign of the cross and wiped his eyes after his wife knelt and set down a large bouquet of white flowers wrapped in clear cellophane.The bulk of Biden's day occurred behind closed doors with families. He said he thought it important to speak with each group individually after delivering his opening remarks, including a woman whose husband and baby boy were lost in the collapse.\"The families are very realistic,\" Biden said. \"They look and see cement upon cement upon cement. They talk about watching the whole floor come down on top of another floor. They know that the chances are as each day goes by diminished.\"\"At a minimum,\" he said, \"they want to recover the bodies.\"The President spent roughly three hours meeting with the dozens of families affected by the tragedy. He had been briefed earlier in the day by officials, including Gov. Ron DeSantis, a chief acolyte of former President Donald Trump who is considered a potential presidential candidate in 2024.\"I think there's more we can do, including, I think I have the power -- we'll know shortly -- to pick up 100% of the costs for the county and state,\" Biden said from an interior conference room at the St. Regis Hotel, where maps and diagrams -- including one showing the storm path of an incoming weather pattern -- hung on the wall.US President Joe Biden greets first responders to the collapse of the 12-story Champlain Towers South condo building in Surfside, during a meeting with them in Miami Beach, Florida, July 1, 2021. - President Joe Biden flew to Florida on Thursday to \"comfort\" families of people killed or still missing in the rubble of a beachfront apartment building, where hopes of finding survivors had all but evaporated.

(Photo by SAUL LOEB / AFP) (Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)Biden hailed their ability to work together responding to a catastrophic building collapse.\"You know what's good about this?\" Biden said. \"We live in a nation where we can cooperate. And it's really important.\"The two men have mostly sought to put aside politics in the wake of the disaster -- though Biden raised eyebrows last week when he told reporters he was \"waiting on a call from him if he needs the help.\" They eventually connected in a phone call that one official described as professional and focused on providing Florida the help it needed. Biden signed an emergency declaration that freed up federal resources and Federal Emergency Management Agency search-and-rescue teams. And DeSantis has appeared alongside Democrats throughout this week during news conferences near the site of the collapse.\"You recognized the severity of this tragedy from day one and you've been very supportive,\" DeSantis said during Thursday's briefing.\"This is life and death,\" Biden said. \"And so \u2014 I don't think \u2014 I just got back from 12 days in Europe. They wonder whether we can do this. And you're doing it. Simple act of everybody doing whatever needs to be done. And it really makes a difference.\"While politics inevitably seep into disaster relief, Biden has emphasized the need for bipartisanship to get things done. While aides began planning for a visit to Florida shortly after the gravity of the disaster became clear, the President issued specific and firm instructions that no visit take place if it meant diverting a single firefighter or law enforcement officer from the search-and-rescue efforts, according to a person familiar with the matter.Throughout the weekend and early this week, officials were in talks with authorities on the ground to ensure the efforts at the condo site were not affected by the requirements of a presidential visit, which typically include a large contingent of state and local police.White House officials said they hoped to keep Thursday's visit as apolitical as possible, instead underscoring Biden's unique capacity for conveying compassion in dark moments.The President has long drawn upon wells of his own private grief to help comfort individuals facing loss. Aides have maintained a file folder of dozens of eulogies he has delivered over the years, along with quotes on loss and grief that can be incorporated into speeches or talking points.In Florida, he assumed a role that presidents have long taken on, with differing levels of aptitude, after natural disasters or man-made catastrophes throw communities into grief.The collapse of Champlain Towers South doesn't fall neatly into either of those categories, neither natural nor criminal, though residents of the building have already begun to lay blame on poor maintenance and neglect. And while hope for finding survivors dims by the day, it is still too early for Biden to officially mourn all of those who have been lost.But in traveling to Surfside, Biden hoped to convey solidarity and resolve even as much about the disaster remains unknown.It won't be the first time as president that he assumes the role of consoler-in-chief. He has sought to correct what he said was a glossing over by his predecessor of the hundreds of thousands who have died from Covid-19, including during a somber White House ceremony when the death toll reached 500,000.\"I know all too well that black hole in your chest. You feel like you're being sucked into it. The survivor's remorse. The anger. The questions of faith in your soul,\" Biden said before observing a moment of silence in front of a candlelit South Portico.",

        "content": "(CNN)Families of more than 100 people still missing after a partial condo building collapse in Surfside, Florida, received sobering news Sunday, when the death toll reached nine and a fire chief said the situation looked dire. It came the same day as CNN learned that a town building official told residents in November 2018 that the building was \"in very good shape,\" just days after receiving a report that warned of \"major structural damage\" to the tower involved in the collapse.Rescue crews have been sifting through a mountain of rubble since Thursday morning, hoping to find those missing.Four more of the dead have been identified, Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said at a news briefing Sunday evening. A total of 134 people have been accounted for and 152 remain unaccounted for, she said.The search crews had been stymied by a fire and the constant threat of further collapse where 55 of the 136 units of Champlain Towers South crashed to the ground.Read MoreThe fire and smoke were under control as of Sunday, the mayor said, and the good weather allowed for the rescue teams to \"move forward without some of the previous challenges that we have faced.\"\"So we continue to sweep the mound, with our canines, using all of the technology available to us and machinery to lift the debris,\" Levine Cava said.JUST WATCHEDRescuers race to find survivors after Florida condo collapseReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRescuers race to find survivors after Florida condo collapse 01:18Condo association was told the building was in 'very good shape' in 2018, report saysRosendo Prieto, the Surfside building official at the time, told the building's condo association at a November 2018 meeting that the tower was in \"very good shape,\" NPR reported Sunday, citing minutes from the meeting that it obtained. Two days before the meeting, Mara Chouela, a member of the condo board, forwarded a copy of a structural engineer's report to Prieto that warned of \"major structural damage,\" according to an email released by the town on Saturday.\"Structural engineer report was reviewed by Mr. Prieto,\" the minutes cited by NPR said, in an apparent reference to a 2018 report from structural engineer Frank Morabito, which detailed cracking and dilapidating concrete in the parking garage underneath the tower, among other significant issues. \"It appears the building is in very good shape,\" the minutes noted, according to NPR.Pancake collapses: What they are and why they're dangerousPrieto no longer works for Surfside and currently serves as the interim building official for Doral, another city in Miami-Dade County, according to the Doral website and a county document. Prieto has not responded to requests for comment from CNN. A resident of the condo, Susana Alvarez, told NPR that she attended the Nov. 15 meeting and remembered a representative of the town saying, \"the building was not in bad shape.\"  Emails released by the town confirm Prieto attended the meeting. The day after the meeting, Prieto sent another email to Guillermo Olmedillo, the former town manager, saying the condo board meeting \"went very well.\" \"The response was very positive from everyone in the room,\" Prieto wrote in the November 16 email, which was released by the town Sunday evening. \"All main concerns over their forty year recertification process were addressed.\"He wrote that the building -- which was built in 1981 -- didn't have to start the recertification until 2021, \"but they have decided to start the process early which I wholeheartedly endorse and wish that this trend would catch on with other properties.\"Mystery of what caused South Florida condo collapse deepensThe structural engineer's report pointed out concerns about structural damage to the concrete slab below the building's pool deck and \"cracking and spalling\" located in the parking garage, according to documents.Spalling is a term used to describe areas of concrete that have cracked or crumbled.The waterproofing below the pool deck and entrance drive was failing and causing \"major structural damage,\" according to the report by Morabito of Morabito Consultants.The report didn't indicate whether the structure was at risk of collapse. In a statement to CNN, Morabito Consultants said that they \"provided the condominium association with an estimate of the probable costs to make the extensive and necessary repairs. Among other things, our report detailed significant cracks and breaks in the concrete, which required repairs to ensure the safety of the residents and the public.\"Abieyuwa Aghayere, a professor of structural engineering at Drexel University who reviewed the report, said its findings were alarming and should have spurred further review of the building's integrity.Search and rescue efforts continue \"We have over 400 personnel strictly utilized for search and rescue,\" Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Chief Alan Cominsky said Sunday. Rescuers battle fire, noise and shifting steel and concrete as they scramble to save lives\"It's a strategic process. We can't have one squad working right on top of another. So we have to space out. We have to have different components. So at one time, I think we have over 200 people working on that debris site.\"Israel and Mexico are both helping with the search efforts, officials said. Crews have cut a deep trench, 125 feet long and 40 feet deep, to help in the search efforts. \"This trench is very critical to the continuation of the search and rescue process,\" the mayor said. \"We continued all night to build that trench, and as a result of that, we were able to recover four additional bodies in the rubble, as well as additional human remains.\"When asked to describe the findings so far from the trench, the fire chief said they were \"horrific\" -- partly because of a lack of voids, or spaces where people may be safely trapped. \"We don't have the voids that we are hoping for, things that we are looking for,\" Cominsky said. \"We are still looking. So that's what I mean by horrific. It's just a difficult, difficult situation.\"But rescuers have not given up on finding survivors.

And when we come up empty-handed, it's difficult for us as well.\"While families hold on to hope for the dozens still missing, officials are trying to both support them and prepare them for the worst.  \"We've also talked with them about the developments, for example with the body parts -- finding body parts,\" said Levine Cava, who was meeting with family members until about midnight Sunday morning. \"Obviously that's a very sobering bit of news. And they are understanding that that is a possibility.

Concrete is falling around some team members as they cut into walls trying to find ways into the voids in the rubble. Meanwhile, some family members wait at a reunification center. Some have given DNA samples in case they are needed to help identify victims.Read MoreJason Pizzo, a state senator, said he has been talking with anxious relatives.\"It's absolute desperation; it's devastation. It's still being called search and rescue,\" he said, but when families see the rubble, it seems like no one is listening. \"They just want to see some sort of movement.\"Three bodies were found overnight from Thursday into Friday in the wreckage of Champlain Towers South in Surfside, Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Assistant Fire Chief Raide Jadallah said -- adding to one found early Thursday.The medical examiner's office identified Stacie Fang as a victim killed in the collapse. Fang is the mother of Jonah Handler, a boy who was pulled alive from the rubble, her family said in a statement.\"There are no words to describe the tragic loss of our beloved Stacie,\" the Fang and Handler family statement said. \"The members of the Fang and Handler family would like to express our deepest appreciation for the outpouring of sympathy, compassion and support we have received. The many heartfelt words of encouragement and love have served as a much needed source of strength during this devastating time.\"How to help Surfside building collapse victimsThe number of people unaccounted for is 159, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava told reporters Friday -- up from the figure of 99 that officials gave Thursday afternoon. Those 159 people \"have been identified as possibly being on the site,\" the mayor said at a news conference Friday afternoon in Surfside. \"So those are people that maybe live there, but we don't know whether they were there at the time.\" Dr. Howard Lieberman, a trauma surgeon with the Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Urban Search & Rescue Task Force, told CNN that crews on Thursday \"did hear some tapping, there was some noise,\" adding that the tapping kept up for a while and then, over the course of the day, \"dissipated.\"According to Lieberman, the search effort has been very emotional, as teams find personal effects in the rubble. \"We're seeing stuffed animals, teddy bears, boxed of diapers, a child's bunk bed, and we're finding a lot of pictures, family pictures, and it's, it's a little bit more emotional than going somewhere, where you know there's no one, let's say for a hurricane where they had enough warning and they had evacuation time and they got out.\" LIVE UPDATES: Dozens unaccounted for.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis at the news conference emphasized the importance of finding out the cause of the collapse.\"We need a definitive explanation for how this could have happened,\" DeSantis said. \"We don't want to get [it] wrong, obviously, but at the same time I do think it's important that it's timely because you have a lot of families here, you have families that lost loved ones ... you have other folks who were able to get out safely, but then lost their homes.\"Three of the four victims have been identified, according to Dr. Emma Lew, director of the Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner Department. One victim died at a hospital. No other information was provided. About 55 of the 136 units at the building a few miles north of Miami Beach collapsed at around 1:30 a.m. Thursday, leaving huge piles of rubble on the ground and materials dangling from what remained of the structure, officials said. Thirty-five people were rescued from standing portions of the building by first responders, Jadallah said Thursday.Numerous search and rescue personnel have been scouring the rubble, including from the surface, with search dogs, sonar and cameras. Structural engineers also have been shoring up other places -- such as areas near a parking garage underneath the rubble -- to allow crews to tunnel underneath with light machinery.     Officials don't know how many people were in the building State Fire Marshal Jimmy Patronis said the search involved \"that delicate balance of saving lives while risking lives,\" with the accumulation of water used to extinguish fires adding dangerous weight to the unstable remains of the buildings.  Crews were taking down license plate numbers of cars in the parking garage in an attempt to determine who was in the building, Patronis said. Surfside Town Manager Andy Hyatt said officials do not know how many people were in the building at the time of the collapse.\"We know that it was about 80% occupied but that doesn't mean that there was 80% occupied with people,\" he told CNN Friday. \"We know that some families around here travel quite a bit.\"This is what we know about those missing in the Miami condo collapseThe building's residents reflected South Florida's international and cultural mix, with affluent families from Argentina, Paraguay and Colombia and a tight-knit Jewish community. Kevin Spiegel said his wife, Judy, is among the missing. He said he was out of town at the time of the collapse.  \"She's just the most amazing person in the world and we would do anything to have her back,\" he told CNN, his two sons --  Michael and Josh -- at his side.    President Joe Biden on Friday approved an emergency declaration for the state, making federal aid available to Florida -- including equipment and other resources -- and authorizing FEMA to coordinate disaster relief efforts. Pancake collapses: What they are and why they're dangerousAdditionally, a team of engineers from the National Institute of Standards and Technology is being sent to Surfside to determine whether a larger investigation that could impact building codes everywhere is needed. The federal agency studies building structural failures and recommends changes to building codes, fire response and emergency communications, according to spokeswoman Jennifer Huergo. The goal of such an investigation, Huergo said, would be to determine \"the technical cause of the collapse\" and the possible need for \"changes to building codes, standards and practices.\" Engineers weigh in on the collapse Although the cause of the partial collapse wasn't known, some engineers who saw it on video shared their expertise with CNN on why the building fell the way it did.  'Our heart goes out to them:' Biden speaks on Florida building collapse as rescue efforts enter second dayGreg Batista, a structural engineer who did work on the building years ago, said concrete repair and a spalling problem can cause collapses. Spalling can occur when part of the surface of the concrete peels, breaks or chips.\"Spalling can get to a point that, if not repaired, it can lead to eventual collapse, and I've been to places where there have been collapses of floors, of beams, of columns,\" Batista said. Batista noted that for that type of collapse to occur, the malfunction of one column is enough to bring a structure down. \"All it takes is one column, and everything can come down like a Jenga,\" he said. \"After having seen the video ... you see the actual building coming down, and the actual collapse begins on one of the lower floors. So immediately, I see that something happened down there.\"  Photos: Deadly condo collapse near MiamiExcavators dig through the remains from the Champlain Towers South building on July 9.Hide Caption 1 of 58 Photos: Deadly condo collapse near MiamiWooden hearts with victims' names have been put up at the memorial site near the building's remains.Hide Caption 2 of 58 Photos: Deadly condo collapse near MiamiNuns from the St. Joseph's Catholic Church pray at the memorial site on July 7.Hide Caption 3 of 58 Photos: Deadly condo collapse near MiamiA member of a search team moves rubble at the site on July 7.

If the pillars fail, everything fails. So that's exactly what looked like that,\" Miyamoto told CNN. Batista offered a glimmer of hope for those unaccounted for, saying it's entirely possible for more people to be rescued. \"If you go back to videos of building crumbling in the past, you've seen miracles of babies being pulled out of small voids either the day after or the week after. There's certainly a possibility that this can happen here,\" Batista said. Kenneth Direktor, an attorney for the association of residents at the condo, said the building had \"thorough engineering inspections over the last several months\" in preparation for compliance with a 40-year certification.The building was constructed in 1981, according to online Miami-Dade property records. Building standards were strengthened after highly destructive Hurricane Andrew in 1992.What we know about the building\"What that tells you is.... nothing like this was foreseeable, at least it wasn't seen by the engineers who were looking at the building from a structural perspective,\" Direktor told CNN.An engineer had already conducted inspections to determine needed repairs, but the only work that had actually commenced was on the roof, Direktor said.Alexandria Santamaria, a property manager for the building until 2019, told CNN on Friday that she was never told immediate repairs were needed during her time managing the property.\"No one ever said there were any signs of repairs that were needed immediately or that there [were] any signs of collapsing,\" she said.Little fingers and screaming led a dog walker to a boy trapped in the collapsed Florida condo rubbleA class-action lawsuit filed Thursday accuses the association of the collapsed condo of \"failures to secure and safeguard\" the lives and property of condo owners. The suit cites statements from Direktor, who said \"repair needs had been identified\" for the condo's structure but had not been completed. \"Defendant could have prevented the collapse of Champlain Towers south through the exercise of ordinary care, safety measures, and oversight,\" the suit alleges. The lawsuit seeks damages in excess of $5 million, though a different amount could be sought as the case proceeds. Direktor responded on behalf of the association saying, \"I don't know what caused this building to fall down ... The engineers don't know with certainty what caused this building to fall down.\" \"How is it that less than 24 hours after the building collapses that this lawyer (who filed the lawsuit for the plaintiffs) knows with certainty what caused the building to fall down?\" Direktor asked. Condo association responseMeanwhile, Donna DiMaggio Berger, an attorney for the Champlain Towers condo association, told CNN's Chris Cuomo that the board met this morning, and they were not privy to any information that would have foreshadowed Thursday's disaster.  Berger said that the building was undergoing a 40-year re-certification process, and what knowledge the board had in terms of repair work came from the engineer's certification report. \"Typical things that an engineer looks for in a certification report in Miami-Dade and Broward County, which are the two counties that require this kind of certification, is a review of the roof, the HVAC system, electrical, plumbing, and the building envelope,\" Berger told Cuomo. \"But certainly, there was nothing hazardous that was outlined in that report, anything that would have proven to be a danger to life.\" Berger added that the engineer outlines what the priorities are, and the priority was the roof replacement, which was underway. Cuomo asked Berger if the board was aware of research done in the 1990's that showed the area where the building collapsed showing signs of land subsidence. Berger replied that they were aware, and she thinks it is significant, but her question to the professor or the team that undertook the research was, \"Did they inform the city, did they inform the county, did they inform the state?\"I mean, that is significant, and I think that's something we want to dig into.\"CNN's Rosa Flores reported from Surfside; Aya Elamroussi, Steve Almasy and Ray Sanchez reported and wrote from Atlanta.

        "content": "(CNN)When firefighters arrived at Austin Parra's home on January 12, 2017, they could see smoke and the charred remnants of an office chair outside.   Parra, then 20, had been transported to the hospital. His mother explained to firefighters that her son's chair caught on fire while he was sleeping, and he was burned as he carried the flaming chair outside.   Anthony Dignoti, the Wethersfield, Connecticut, fire marshal in charge of investigating the incident, could see that the door and door frame were damaged by the fire as well. He noticed bowls strewn about, which he wrote in his official report had been filled with water in an attempt to extinguish the fire.      \n\nThe fire at Austin Parra's home originated with an AmazonBasics USB cord, Fire Marshal Anthony Dignoti determined. (Courtesy Wethersfield Fire Marshal's Office) \nBut most interesting to Dignoti was a white USB cord. Part of the cord was hanging off the chair and still intact, but the other side was stuck to the seat and had melted into a bare wire, he said in his report and an interview with CNN.  Dignoti ultimately concluded that the fire originated with the cord Parra was using to charge his cellphone. His report stated the cord experienced a short circuit, and while it was unclear why this happened, \"the heat produced by the cord ignited the upholstery for the office chair.\" Read MoreThe cord had been branded with the name of the world's largest online retailer: Amazon. It was sold by one of Amazon's popular private label lines, AmazonBasics, which offers budget-friendly products including consumer electronics, household appliances, home goods and office accessories.   Launched in 2009, AmazonBasics has grown to offer more than 5,000 products, according to the retailer. Its mission: identifying everyday items that Amazon can create at a similar or higher quality and lower price point when compared to existing name brands -- a strategy also employed by companies such as Costco and Target.  Key findingsUsing keywords including \"fire,\" \"dangerous\" and \"burn,\" reporters identified more than 1,500 reviews about AmazonBasics electronics and appliances posted by US customers on Amazon.com from 2016 through early 2020 that described safety-related issues. More than 10% of the reviews identified by CNN reported that products had caught fire -- in some cases describing how flames shot out of the devices. Nearly 200 included reports of damage to homes or belongings, including charred walls and fried cellphones.A growing number of AmazonBasics products, which the company promotes heavily on its site, have become bestsellers since the line's inception, and many have ratings above four stars, according to Marketplace Pulse research. In recent months, the online retailer's sales have been soaring as millions of Americans have been staying at home -- and in many cases working remotely -- during the ongoing pandemic. But consumers have raised serious safety concerns about AmazonBasics items in complaints to government regulators and in reviews posted on Amazon's own website. Since 2016, at least 1,500 reviews, covering more than 70 items, have described products exploding, catching on fire, smoking, melting, causing electrical malfunctions or otherwise posing risks, according to an analysis of AmazonBasics electronics and appliances listed on its website. The reviews identified represent a small fraction of the overall purchases of the products, and fires caused by consumer electronics are not unique to Amazon branded items. User error can also be a factor, as can faulty or aging wiring within a home or a defective device being used in conjunction with the product.  But when well-made and used properly by consumers, electronics like those sold under the AmazonBasics name should rarely pose dangers, said electrical engineers interviewed by CNN.

Around 30 items with three or more reviews like this remain for sale on Amazon.com today. At least 11 other products that fit this criteria were no longer for sale at the time of publication. Some became unavailable after CNN began its reporting, and at least four product pages were removed from the retailer's site entirely -- leaving behind dead URLs known by employees as \"dog pages.\" Amazon confirmed that at least eight of these products had been under investigation, but said the company determined they all met its safety standards. Customers have written in their reviews and said in interviews that they trusted that AmazonBasics purchases would be safe and well made since they were branded with Amazon's name and frequently touted as \"Amazon's Choice.\" But even as complaints have mounted, the company has provided little or no information to consumers or the public about how it is handling allegations that some of its merchandise is unsafe.     \n\nThis review was written about an AmazonBasics car charger that has multiple consumer safety complaints. \nAmazon shoppers have recounted frightening malfunctions and close calls in vivid detail: A surge protector turned into a \"blowtorch,\" one father recalled -- saying that flames shot out of the device, which was near his baby's nursery. Phone chargers were said to have burned peoples' hands and legs, and exploding batteries allegedly sprayed chemicals in someone's face. A USB cord burst into flames in a parked car while a toddler was inside, according to one parent. A charger in another car was reported as starting an electrical fire on the freeway, allegedly burning the driver and a jacket. Paper shredders turned on by themselves, according to multiple consumers, and one reportedly blew up in a \"fireball,\" burning someone's arm and singeing the hair off. And a microwave suddenly caught on fire when an 8-year-old went to heat up her macaroni and cheese cup as she had done \"a zillion times,\" a mother claimed, saying she had to take the appliance outside and spray it with a hose. Each of these purchases were \"verified,\" meaning Amazon confirmed that the customer who wrote the review actually purchased the product on the site and didn't receive a \"deep discount,\" according to its website. Several were accompanied by photos of the burned items.       \n\nMore than 150 reviews about the AmazonBasics microwave describe safety concerns including flames and smoke.\nWhile the best way to determine why something malfunctioned is to physically test it and take it apart, many customers said they immediately threw out the defective devices or sent them back to Amazon at the company's request. CNN obtained two damaged AmazonBasics products from customers: a microwave that a customer said caught fire and a USB cord a user said overheated and melted. These were tested by researchers at the failure analysis lab at the University of Maryland's Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE) at CNN's request.The USB cord was too burned for researchers to determine what had gone wrong. The microwave testing found that the design of the panel covering the heating device inside the microwave could result in the machine catching on fire, and determined that the way the panel was secured could allow debris such as food or grease to collect behind it and possibly ignite. As soon as the researchers turned it on, the microwave began sparking and smoking, causing it to react as if its user put foil or other metal inside. The testing was cut short when the lab was closed due to Covid-19.      \nTop: A research scientist at the CALCE lab examines the inside of an AmazonBasics microwave.

Right: A damaged part from an AmazonBasics microwave is compared with a new part.\n\"There's a risk in using this machine for sure, and it's a safety risk because this clearly heated up to the extent a fire could occur,\" said engineering professor Michael Pecht, who is the founder of CALCE and has previously assisted in government safety investigations. \"This is more than a reliability problem, this is a potential safety problem.\"Amazon did not comment on whether any improvements had been made to the microwave, but said it is confident the microwave is safe to use and that it continues to \"meet or exceed\" all of the applicable certification requirements. The retailer said \"safety is a top priority\" at the company and that it takes a number of steps to ensure all AmazonBasics products are safe and high quality, such as selecting experienced manufacturers, monitoring customer feedback and testing items to ensure they pass safety and compliance standards both before and after they are available. It also said AmazonBasics offers thousands of products which combined have more than 1 million reviews, and that concerns are thoroughly investigated and that the company acts accordingly. \n\n\n\n\nMute\nUnmute\n\n\n\"Not safe,\" one verified purchaser wrote in a review about an AmazonBasics microwave, including a home video that shows the device sparking and making loud popping noises.\n\n\n\"The outcome of the investigation varies on a case by case basis and may include removing the product from the store, adjusting the design of the product, notifying customers to stop using the product, or other appropriate action,\" a company spokesperson said in a statement. \"We want customers to shop with confidence and if ever a customer has a concern, they can contact customer service and we will investigate.\" Amazon said there are a number of reasons an item may no longer be available, but that customers will be notified if a critical safety issue is identified. When asked how frequently the company has done this, Amazon said it had notified customers about an AmazonBasics product less than five times. It did not specify whether it did this for any of the items reviewed by CNN. 'It's a red flag'  Amazon has already been under intense scrutiny for allowing third party sellers with allegedly dangerous offerings to do business on the site, and multiple court rulings have found that the retailer can be held liable for defective items sold in its third party marketplace.    CNN's analysis focused on products sold with Amazon's own name on them -- a growing part of the retailer's business.  The reviews come from people living all over the United States and span five years, but they often call attention to the very same problems:  The same panel within a microwave catching fire, USB cords melting or burning despite no visible wear and tear or overuse, and paint on outdoor patio heaters lighting on fire. Consumers alleged items malfunctioned the first time they plugged them in. Others said electronics were not in use when they began malfunctioning. In general, one or two reports of problems could be more easily chalked up to user error or other external factors, multiple electrical engineers said. But as the number of reports about the same kinds of failures increases about the same item, so does the likelihood that there is a defect in the design or manufacturing.      \nResearchers at the CALCE lab compare a new AmazonBasics microwave to one that had visible burn damage.\n\"That would certainly lead to more suspicion that the product is at fault,\" said Mark Horenstein, a professor at Boston University's College of Engineering. \"It's a red flag.\" Amazon said customer reviews are only one indication of a potential issue, saying it looks at a number of other factors such as sales history, returns and customer service contacts when assessing potential problems. \"Using customer reviews alone to conclude a product is unsafe or imply there's a widespread issue is misleading,\" the company said in a statement. Former Amazon employees said that even a few reviews mentioning words like \"fire\" and \"hazard\" should automatically prompt the retailer to take action. Amazon said reviews are monitored and can trigger safety investigations, but it declined to provide details about the specific threshold needed for this to happen. The company said products may be temporarily removed during such inquiries and that in order to keep selling something, it must be confirmed to be safe. It also said that if an investigation uncovers a \"potential, non-isolated safety issue,\" it takes appropriate measures to notify the government and \"safely recall the product.\"       \n    \n\nThis AmazonBasics surge protector remains for sale despite reviews about dangers and a report to the CPSC that it \"made a loud popping noise, sparked, and the case was opened by the force of the damage.\" Amazon said the product is safe and that most reports involved customers who plugged in multiple large electronics. Some reviews identified by CNN said nothing was plugged into the device, however. Businesses are required by law to immediately report \"potentially hazardous\" items to the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) so the agency can determine whether an official recall is necessary. Companies can also initiate voluntary recalls in cooperation with the CPSC.Concerns similar to those detailed in Amazon reviews have been relayed to the CPSC in at least 10 reports that specifically mention an AmazonBasics product. The complaints cover at least eight different items and date back to 2012. In the United States, Amazon publicly recalled two AmazonBasics items in 2018 and 2019, after the company received 53 reports in the US about power banks overheating and 25 about versions of a space heater overheating, burning or sparking. It said it proactively notified the CPSC of the results of the company's own investigation and its intent to recall the items.  Beyond these two official recalls, the company has never publicly acknowledged that AmazonBasics products have any safety issues.    \n\n\n\nThe CPSC said it was prohibited by law from discussing any item that had not been recalled and that in general, the agency determines if a recall is necessary based on a number of factors, including \"the nature of the defect, the level of hazard associated with the issue, and the pattern of similar problems (seen).\"Customers reported being shocked or burned in at least 100 reviews on Amazon's website. Parra from the Connecticut apartment fire said in a lawsuit that he suffered second-degree burns and injuries to his throat from smoke inhalation. Dignoti's report shows Parra spent around a day in the hospital. Parra sued Amazon in 2019, and the case settled. He and his attorney did not respond to interview requests.CNN used the information provided by the fire department to determine that the type of cord Parra purchased had been removed from Amazon's website. While it is unclear when the cord was pulled, a version of the page captured by the Wayback Machine, an internet archive, shows the product had an average rating of 4.1 out of 5 stars. It shows the cord was still available for purchase until at least June 2017, and that there were warnings from other customers at least a year before Parra's January 2017 fire.     \nThe link for the phone cord used by Parra now leads to nothing but a dead URL known internally at Amazon as a dog page.\n\n\"End of the cable melted and started smoking. Glad we caught it before a fire,\" one verified purchaser wrote in June 2016.    \"DO NOT BUY! FIRE HAZARD!\" another customer with a verified purchase of the cord wrote in May 2016, attaching 10 photos of the melted and warped cord -- saying it ruined an expensive iPhone and that he considered himself lucky that a fire hadn't ignited. \"These should be taken off the market immediately!!!\"While fires caused by USB cords are uncommon, they are possible, according to electrical engineers who said a range of factors could be at play in situations like this -- from problems with whatever device the cord is plugged into to defects within the cord itself.     \n\nThe AmazonBasics lightning charger that this review was written about became unavailable after CNN began its reporting.\nAn industry non-profit, the USB Implementers Forum Inc, said it does not believe user error is a significant cause of overheating USB cables. A cable that is substandard, whether because of a design or manufacturing defect, can be dangerous and lead to electric shock, overheating, sparks or fire, it said. The group has certified a number of AmazonBasics cables as meeting their standards, though it focuses on the functionality of the cables and making sure their specifications are in compliance -- emphasizing that it is \"not a replacement for industry best practices or any applicable local, state or government statutes, rules or regulations pertaining to safety.\" The group also said it conducted an internal review of several cables CNN brought to its attention and found them to be compliant. It does not certify proprietary lightning USB cords used for Apple devices, however, such as Parra's cord. Apple said it allows manufacturers to use its lightning connectors in their products if those items are tested and confirmed to meet high quality standards, and that the company expects manufacturers to meet any applicable safety standards. \n\n\n\nHave you purchased an AmazonBasics product?\n\nEmail us to share your experience \n\n\nAmazon meanwhile said it investigated the safety claims about the kind of cord used by Parra and determined it met the company's standards. \"If we determine that a product is unsafe, we remove it from our stores and take all necessary actions, which may include contacting regulators and customers,\" it said, specifically in response to questions about the cord used by Parra, which was removed from the site.  The retailer did introduce a new version of the product, however, saying it made updates to improve the customer experience. Losing trust  Matt Citro purchased his AmazonBasics surge protector to protect his family from a fire. Instead, he said that in January 2018, the surge protector itself caught fire. A single phone charger was plugged into the device, but was not being used at the time.  Sitting on the couch as his 9-month-old son slept in his nursery nearby, Citro said he noticed flames coming out of the surge protector -- turning it into what resembled a \"blowtorch.\" He told CNN that he quickly pulled the flaming device from the wall. He wasn't injured but said he was left with more than $1,000 of damage after the surge protector burned a hole in the wall outlet and seared part of his wall.       \n\nMatt Citro says that he sent back his charred surge protector so that it could be investigated by Amazon. He never heard anything back, but did receive a payment to cover damage to his home. (Courtesy Matt Citro)He had never experienced any electrical issues in his home before this, he said, and was convinced the AmazonBasics surge protector was to blame. \"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!...If I wasn't home my entire house would have burnt down from this cheap product,\" Citro wrote in a review. \"I'm extremely disappointed in Amazon. We put a lot of faith in their products and to have (one) almost burn down my home does not make me trust them. This product has amazons name on it!\"  Citro said he immediately contacted Amazon and told the company what happened. At first, he said he was offered a replacement or a refund. Not satisfied, he continued to call customer service. He said he finally got through to someone who connected him with an insurance company, and he was ultimately paid $1,469, according to a settlement document reviewed by CNN in which Amazon denies any liability.  \n\n\n\n\nAmazon continued to sell the surge protector for nearly two years after Citro posted his review, during which time more reviews about similar situations and other concerns piled up. More than 40 customers reported that the product was a fire hazard, had caused damage to their home or belongings or described other dangers. These reviews represented around 1.7% of the roughly 2,600 US reviews posted about the $10.99 device as of late last year, before Amazon removed it from the site. Several included claims of flames and fires like Citro's. As a comparison, a similar product made by a major consumer electronics company and also sold on Amazon's site had six reviews about possible safety concerns earlier this year, representing .07% of its more than 8,000 reviews. And none of the six mentioned actual fires. Amazon said its own analysis, which added global reviews about the AmazonBasics surge protector, found 1.1% involved claims of overheating, fire and other dangers. One former AmazonBasics product manager, who asked to remain anonymous because she still works in the industry, said she was surprised to hear that such a high percentage of reviews raised safety issues about an AmazonBasics item. \"Once you get 40, oh my gosh, no, that would not be acceptable in any shape, way or form,\" she said of the reviews found by CNN, adding that a ratio of around .05% would have been seen as more acceptable when she worked there. But she defended her former employer, saying this was just one product and that during her time with the company, she believed the retailer was even more vigilant than competitors in trying to react to safety concerns.          \n\nMore than 40 customers reported dangers involving the same surge protector that Citro said burst into flames.\nWeeks after CNN began reporting on the surge protector -- reaching out to customers and employees and ordering the same item as part of the investigation -- Amazon pulled it from its site in December despite its high average rating of 4.4 stars as of a month earlier. The company did not appear to provide any notification to customers, including to the reporters who purchased it. And it did not post any message on its site about why it was taken down.  Amazon declined to comment on individual customers, and would not say why the page was removed or whether Citro's surge protector was tested. It did say an updated version of the product had been released, but when asked for the link to the updated version, the company said \"this product is currently unavailable.\"   Citro, who said he still shops at Amazon frequently, said he sent his burned surge protector back for testing as the company requested, but never heard anything about what its investigation found.  \"I do wish this particular product was tested more thoroughly,\" he said. \"A lot was on the line with my son's bedroom in the next room.\"  Just like Parra's phone cord, this specific kind of surge protector has not been officially recalled.Behind the scenes  Three former Amazon employees said the vast majority of AmazonBasics electronics are made in Asia. The company's list of suppliers used for its various private label lines -- including AmazonBasics -- shows that only around 10% are in the United States and nearly half are located in China.  The retailer typically brings AmazonBasics items to market in two ways, explained the former product manager. It either goes straight to manufacturers that are able to meet its standards and works closely with them to create items for the AmazonBasics line. Or Amazon finds an existing product and works with a third-party company, which may use an outside manufacturer of its own, to brand the item with the AmazonBasics name. The reviewsMore than 90% of the reviews CNN analyzed were about \"verified purchases.\" Some 400 reviews posted on the site included photos or videos as visual evidence of their claims. Reviews came from around 70 product pages, which sometimes included multiple variations of an item (such as USB cords in different lengths or colors), which may have separate identification numbers. Reviews were excluded if a product had clearly been used incorrectly -- for example, those saying non-rechargeable batteries were placed in a charger.  Most reviews did not include people's full names, but CNN did reach more than 30 customers, and many provided information such as evidence of their purchases, photos, additional details and correspondence with Amazon.  She said both methods have been implemented for electronics, but that in this second scenario, Amazon typically has less insight into the manufacturing process and is less involved in quality and safety testing. Amazon disputed this, saying it verifies that products meet the same safety standards regardless of the business model. The company also said it most frequently works directly with manufacturers.Related: Fake and dangerous kids products are turning up for sale on AmazonAnother former employee who was involved with AmazonBasics in its earlier years and asked to remain anonymous because of a confidentiality agreement, said employees on the AmazonBasics team would randomly order items to inspect and stay on top of reviews to make sure red flags were being caught. \"We didn't have a lot of problems in my time but were much smaller than they are now so it was easy to keep things under control,\" the former employee said.  Former Amazon manager Rachel Greer, who left the company in 2015, said that when she worked in compliance at the company, she believed AmazonBasics products were closely monitored from conception to the years following their launch, saying there was extensive testing done. She said safety issues were rare, but when they occurred, they were caught quickly and addressed as soon as possible. \"If someone complained on a review, we took it very seriously,\" she said. This required staying on top of manufacturers and making sure corners weren't cut, she and the AmazonBasics product manager both said. In the case of USB cords, for example, Greer described how she made sure there was frequent testing of the cords to ensure that manufacturers hadn't begun to swap in thinner wiring which could be more likely to cause cords to overheat.      A customer said this AmazonBasics retractable USB cord began melting only a few months after he purchased it. \"Had my wife not heard it crackling it could have started a fire,\" he wrote in a review.\"When you're in charge of compliance for something that has the Amazon brand on it, I didn't think it should be something we're messing around with,\" Greer said. \"When you're outsourcing production there's a lot of things that can go wrong.\"     When she left Amazon, she said she was growing concerned that a drive to increase sales would overshadow a focus on safety as the number of AmazonBasics offerings continued to rise. Prior to her departure, she would increasingly disagree with product managers, who she said pushed to get items into the pipeline faster and more cheaply. Performance evaluations reviewed by reporters backed up the idea that Greer had clashed with colleagues but also described her as \"an evangelist for product safety,\" saying \"she is passionate about keeping customers safe.\"Greer now works as a consultant to third-party sellers, and said she wasn't surprised to hear that customers were complaining of alleged dangers. She said that when she worked for Amazon, she was never aware of anything close to the number or level of seriousness of the reviews identified by CNN, and questioned whether testing was still as rigorous as it had been in the past. \n\n\n\n\n\"If this had happened on a seller product, the second complaint of fire it would have been taken down,\" she said, while scanning through some of the more than 150 reviews about serious problems with a voice-activated AmazonBasics microwave \u2014 the same product tested by CALCE. Greer said that if she was still at the company and had seen so many reports of fire about a single item, she likely would have reported the microwave to the CPSC and worked with the business teams to enact a voluntary recall by the company. Since the microwave's release in the fall of 2018, its product page has been flooded with reports from consumers about problems including flames, smoke and sparks. These kinds of reviews made up roughly 5% of the AmazonBasics microwave's more than 3,000 reviews as of February, when CNN's final analysis was conducted. Another roughly 1,000 reviews have been posted since then, with fires being reported as recently as September. A microwave that has been reviewed less frequently but is the same size and wattage had only 10 reviews describing similar safety issues -- amounting to around .7% of its roughly 1,350 reviews on Amazon.      \nResearch scientists use x-ray CT scanning to test AmazonBasics retractable charging cords and microwave parts. .\u00a0\nWhile the retailer did not provide unit sales, Amazon said that as the best-selling microwave on the site, it may have a higher number of sales and reviews, which could result in more mentioning possible concerns.The company disputed Greer's comments, saying safety testing had not become any less rigorous and that it was not aware of any manufacturers using thinner cables \"than they were directed to use.\" It said safety testing is handled by reputable third-party labs with global facilities, including in China and that her statements about the microwave were speculative since she was not part of the team that worked on this item and was not involved in the testing of the device. Amazon also said it proactively sends safety-related customer reports to the CPSC and noted the agency has not issued any consumer warnings about the AmazonBasics microwave.Still for sale   Amazon declined to provide details about why certain products were investigated and removed from its site, while others with repeated complaints about the same hazards are still available to purchase today.  \n\n\n\nLeeona Smail said her AmazonBasics battery charger began to melt and smoke.\n\n\nNew mom Leeona Smail posted her review about an AmazonBasics battery charger late last year. When CNN reached her, she recounted how she and her husband were forced to evacuate their home in the middle of the night when they detected the unmistakable smell of something burning. They gathered their dogs, cats and 4-month-old baby by their front porch, called 911 and waited for help to arrive.  It wasn't until after the firefighters left that the Smails said they found what they believed awas the culprit: an AmazonBasics battery charger. They had used the device for several years to charge batteries. But this time, Smail said, after unplugging it from the wall and placing it in a box on their coffee table, it began to melt and smoke. When the fire chief returned the next day to check on them, she said, he was amazed to see the source of the smell.A Vandergrift, Pennsylvania fire chief confirmed that his team was dispatched to investigate \"a smoke odor and light haze\" at the Smail home. He said they ultimately learned that a battery charger \"overheated and melted,\" and said it was unclear whether it would have caused the house to catch fire if it hadn't been found.     \n\nOther reviews about the same battery charger have described similar concerns. It is still available for sale.Smail posted a photo of the burned device along with her review before throwing it away. Amazon eventually gave her a refund -- though she said she only received a partial one because the warranty window had passed. CreditsVideo Collette RichardsDrew GriffinPhotographerHeather FulbrightPhoto editorBrett RoegiersDesigners Tiffany BakerWill MulleryDeveloperIvory ShermanAt least 21 other reviews about the same battery charger, which had around 2,000 total reviews at the time of CNN's analysis, also said the device had overheated, melted or burned. Three described the same situation that Smail reported: the charger had not even been plugged in and had no batteries in it at the time. The item was still for sale on Amazon at the time of publication. The company said an investigation confirmed the product was safe, and that there were no broader design or safety concerns. But when asked whether it tested any of the actual chargers customers had flagged, and if so, what those tests had found, Amazon said it did not have \"information to share.\"  What should we investigate next?

        "content": "(CNN)A federal judge in Washington on Wednesday declared that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's moratorium on eviction -- a key element of the federal government's efforts to aid those hit hardest by the Covid pandemic and its economic effects -- must be set aside.The ruling from Judge Dabney Friedrich says the Public Health Service Act does not give CDC the legal authority to impose the moratorium, which was first issued last year.The current federal eviction moratorium was scheduled to end on June 30. It is unclear what will happen now. The Justice Department, which is appealing a similar ruling in Texas, filed Wednesday to appeal Friedrich's decision and the judge issued a temporary stay of her ruling.She also set a briefing schedule for arguments on the Justice Department's request for a longer stay of the ruling pending appeal. The plaintiffs' response to the department's request for a longer stay is due by May 12, and the department must then respond four days later.The CDC referred an inquiry for comment to the Justice Department.Read More\"The Court recognizes that the Covid-19 pandemic is a serious public health crisis that has presented unprecedented challenges for public health officials and the nation as a whole. The pandemic has triggered difficult policy decisions that have had enormous real-world consequences. The nationwide eviction moratorium is one such decision,\" Friedrich wrote in her opinion. \"It is the role of the political branches, and not the courts, to assess the merits of policy measures designed to combat the spread of disease, even during a global pandemic,\" she continued. \"The question for the Court is a narrow one: Does the Public Health Service Act grant the CDC the legal authority to impose a nationwide eviction moratorium? It does not.\"There have been several legal challenges to the CDC eviction moratorium. Some courts have said that the CDC has the authority to issue the order and rejected efforts to stop the ban, while others have ruled in favor of landlords. A federal judge in Ohio ruled that the CDC had overstepped its authority in issuing a nationwide eviction ban.Housing experts said they are still reviewing the decision and its implications, noting there are now conflicting rulings at the district court level, all of which have had limited impact. Diane Yentel, CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, called for the Justice Department to appeal. \"The DOJ should immediately appeal the flawed ruling and the Biden administration should continue to vigorously defend and enforce the moratorium, at least until emergency rental assistance provided by Congress reaches the renters who need it to remain stably housed,\" she said Wednesday. But a group representing landlords praised the ruling.\"Today's decision is just the latest in a line of lower courts opinions throwing out CDC's brazen power grab as being well outside of the agency's authority,\" said Caleb Kruckenberg, litigation counsel for the New Civil Liberties Alliance. \"Having now agreed to hear the case on an expedited basis, the Eleventh Circuit is poised to be the first federal appeals court to strike down the moratorium and protect housing providers across the country who have been forced to provide unlimited free housing to their tenants.\"Moratorium ordered by TrumpThe CDC's moratorium stems from an executive action signed by former President Donald Trump last August shortly after a previous moratorium on evictions lapsed, as Congress proved unable to come to a deal to extend the provision.The original ban, which lawmakers approved as part of a massive coronavirus relief bill in March 2020, covered mortgages backed by federal funds. The nonprofit Urban Institute has estimated that moratorium covered just over 12 million households.The following month, the CDC moved to temporarily halt evictions for a broader group of struggling Americans. The White House said the order apply to those who qualified for direct stimulus payments in the March relief bill, which covered individuals who earn less than $99,000 a year. People also have to prove that they've made efforts to get government assistance for their rental payments, declare that their inability to pay is because of financial hardship due to Covid and that they would likely become homeless if they were evicted.In a conference call with reporters at the time, administration officials pointed to the CDC director's authority \"to take measures that are reasonably necessary to mitigate the spread of communicable disease,\" when asked why the move would come from a health agency. \"Congress has delegated broad authority to (the Department of Health and Human Services), the Surgeon General and CDC, to take reasonable efforts to combat the spread of communicable diseases, and frankly I think it makes sense for those authorities abroad because we don't know for any given situation or scenario what steps will be needed to stop the spread,\" an administration official told reporters. \"The home has been sort of the focal point of people social distancing and building sort of a safe space for themselves over the past few months.\"The official also said people \"may end up in overcrowded congregated living facilities or homeless shelters, and that is a potential recipe for a big spread of Covid-19.\"In March, the CDC extended the ban to June 30, the third time the deadline had been pushed back.An estimated 10.7 million adults living in rental housing -- 15% of adult renters -- were not caught up on rent, according to a Center on Budget & Policy Priorities' report on Census data collected in the last half of March.Growing back rent tab While federal and local eviction moratoriums have helped keep people in their homes during the pandemic, back rent continued to pile up. The nation's renters owed an estimated $57 billion in back rent in January, according to a Moody's Analytics report.Congress included $25 billion for rental assistance in its December stimulus package and provided another $27 billion in the American Rescue Plan Act that passed in March.The pot of money from December is making its way into renters' hands now and the money approved in March will follow after Treasury releases new guidance, which is expected in coming weeks.States, cities and counties are either ramping up existing rental assistance programs or launching new ones to get the unprecedented volume of funds out the door. There are currently more than 200 of these programs that are open and accepting applications, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition.Tenants must meet an income requirement, show they've lost income during the pandemic and demonstrate a risk of homelessness in order to qualify for the money.This story has been updated with additional information.CNN's Nikki Carvajal contributed to this story.",

        "content": "New York (CNN Business)Used cars, homes, lumber, gas and chicken: What do they all have in common? They're all getting more expensive.The stimulus-fueled economy is rebounding and Americans are again spending on shopping, traveling and eating out. But the pandemic is far from over, and supply-chain woes mean supply isn't meeting demand -- sending prices even higher. US consumer prices in April increased 4.2% from a year earlier, more than the 3.6% economists had predicted. It was the biggest 12-month increase since September 2008, the height of the financial crisis.Here's what's getting more expensive and why, according to CNN Business' writers.ChickenRead MoreChicken prices are increasing.Chickens are in short supply, sparking an increase in prices. Part of the blame goes to Tyson's roosters.The meat processor, which sells poultry along with beef and pork, said that its chicken volumes have been low in part because the roosters it uses for breeding are not meeting expectations.\"We're changing out a male that, quite frankly, we made a bad decision on,\" said Donnie King, Tyson's chief operating officer and group president of poultry, during an analyst call this week.To increase its chicken supply, Tyson (TSN) is switching back to the male breeding chickens they previously used. The company declined to share what will happen to the rejected roosters, or how many are being swapped out.Food in general is also getting more expensive: Prices rose 0.4% in April as both groceries and restaurant prices went up. Year-over-year, food prices are up 2.4%.GasolineThe average price of a gallon gas hit $3 this week.A growing number of gas stations along the East Coast were without fuel over the last week  as nervous drivers aggressively fill up their tanks following a ransomware attack that shut down the Colonial Pipeline, a critical artery for gasoline, for six days.The panic-buying threatened to exacerbate the supply shock. US gasoline demand climbed by 14% on Tuesday compared with the week before, according to GasBuddy, an app that tracks fuel prices and demand.The pipeline reopened Wednesday night, but before it did average prices at the pump climbed above the key psychological milestone of $3 a gallon on Wednesday for the first time in more than six years, according to AAA.HomesLimited inventory has sparked an incease in home prices.The beginning of 2021 has seen home prices continue to climb to new record-breaking heights, with prices rising in almost every major metro area. Limited inventory is partly the reason why. In 99% of metro areas tracked by the the National Association of Realtors, prices in the first quarter of 2021 increased over the same period last year, according to a NAR report. Nationally, the median sale price for existing homes climbed 16% from the first quarter of 2020 to $319,200, both record highs since NAR began tracking city data quarterly in 1989.Nearly 90% of metro areas saw double-digit percentage price increases over last year. By comparison, only 25% of areas saw such growth in the first quarter of 2020, when housing inventory was at a healthier level and better matched the pace of monthly demand.LumberLumber is getting more expensive.As the pandemic crushed the US economy last spring, sawmills shut down lumber production to brace for a housing slump. The slump never arrived and now there isn't enough lumber to feed the red-hot housing market.The shortage is delaying construction of badly needed new homes, complicating renovations of existing ones and causing sticker shock for buyers in what was already a scorching market.Random-length lumber futures hit a record high of $1,615 last week, a staggering sevenfold gain from the low in early April 2020. That's a big deal because lumber is the most substantial supply that home builders buy. The price fell to $1,533 on Wednesday.Used cars and trucksThere was a 10% price increase in used cars and trucks.The biggest driver of April's inflation jump was a steep 10% increase in used cars and truck prices. That spike accounted for more than a third of the overall inflation increase and was the biggest price rise since the government started tracking used car data in 1953. Over the past year, used car prices rose 21%.Making matters worse is that car dealer lots have only a fraction of the vehicles that they typically have of both new and used vehicles. That's  sending prices to record levels. For example, the average new car price was $37,200 in the first quarter, according to JD Power, up 8.4% from the same period just a year ago.\"That puts wholesale used prices at the highest level they've ever been,\" said David Paris of JD Power. \"And we are seeing used retail prices accelerating rapidly.\"--CNN Business' Anna Bahney, Matt Egan Chris Isidore, Anneken Tappe and Danielle Wiener-Bronner contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)To read the daily missives being sent by former President Donald Trump, you might be led to believe that the ongoing recount of ballots in Arizona's Maricopa County is, well, a serious endeavor. \"This could be Voter Fraud at the highest level,\" Trump promised his supporters late last month. \"Don't think that Arizona is the only State. Much more to come!\"Don't be fooled. The Maricopa recount, which is being run by Republicans in the state Senate, is a travashamockery of an actual audit of votes --- which the county has previously done, and they found no evidence of widespread voter fraud and other issues. It is a conclusion in search of supporting \"facts,\" a witch hunt of the first order.The latest example? The search for bamboo -- yes, bamboo -- in some of the ballots cast in Maricopa County.In an interview with a local CBS TV reporter named Dennis Welch, a man named John Brakey, the founder of a group called AUDIT USA, which is involved in the recount process, laid out the bamboo theory.Read More\"There's accusations that 40,000 ballots were flown in and it was stuffed in the box ... and it came from the southeast part of the world ... Asia,\" explained Brakey, adding later:  \"What they're doing is to find out whether it is bamboo in the paper.\"Welch, rightly confused, asks for clarification. Which Braes provides: \"Because it was bamboo in their paper; there's bamboo in their paper process ... people in southeast Asia.\" Worth noting: Brakey wants to make clear he doesn't believe the bamboo theory himself. \"I don't believe any of that. I'm just saying that is part of the mystery that we want to un-gaslight people about and this is a way to do it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\n\n\nIt appears as though this conspiracy theory comes from the mind of someone named Jovan Pulitzer, whose Twitter handle describes him as a \"Missoula, MT Google Scholar.\" Uh huh. (Kudos to Slate for tracing the genesis of all of this.)Here's Pulitzer explaining his bamboo theory in late 2020:\"Now let's say there was an influx of China ballots. China does not have the tree and lumber population we have because it got deforested primarily a long time ago. They use bamboo -- and they do use wood pulps -- they use bamboo in their paper and they use about 27 different mixes of grasses that we don't have here in the United States. And even though you can't look at it and see it, it's very detectable.\"Uh, riiiiight.  This is, of course, utter bunk being passed of as sound science (or something). There is zero evidence that 40,000 ballots -- bamboo-laced or not! -- were \"flown in and stuffed in the box,\" in the words of Brakey. None.While the bamboo theory is the most outlandish thing to emerge from this Maricopa recount, it's far from the only evidence that this process is simply not trustworthy. Consider: Arizona Senate Republicans have handed the logistics of the recount to a cyber-security company called Cyber Ninjas. The CEO of that firm, according to the Arizona Republic, had touted a variety of election conspiracy theories on Twitter and been a part of an effort to overturn the results in Michigan. Cyber Ninjas have said that the audit will cost far more than the $150,000 Senate Republicans in the state are paying them but won't disclose who else is providing funding for the effort. (One American News has said they are raising money for the recount.)* The auditors are not following Arizona law laid out for the recounting of ballots. And Cyber Ninjas has provided little to no information about who these people are and what their particular expertise is to be involved in this audit.The whole thing stinks. And would be laughable if so many people -- including the former President of the United States -- didn't take it so seriously. Because they do, what's happening in Arizona is rightly and truly scary.",

        "content": "(CNN)Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey on Tuesday signed into law a controversial bill that could remove tens of thousands of voters from the state's early mail-in voting list, shortly after the GOP-controlled state Senate passed the legislation.SB 1485 would revise the state's permanent early voting list, which allows a voter to automatically receive a ballot by mail for every election. It would remove voters who have not participated in the last four elections, including partisan primaries, and don't respond to final mailed notices. \"Arizona is a national leader when it comes to election integrity and access to the ballot box, and today I signed #SB1485 to continue that legacy,\" Ducey wrote on Twitter.Earlier on Tuesday, senators passed the bill on a 16-14 party-line vote. The Arizona House had approved the legislation last month.Under the bill, voters would not be eligible to be removed from the list until January 2025, following the 2022 and 2024 cycles. Read More\"This bill removes nonvoters,\" GOP state senator Vince Leach said in defending the bill. \"These people have plenty of other means for voting.\"Critics say the bill amounts to voter suppression, making it more difficult for occasional voters, voters of color, independents and rural Indigenous voters. Opponents say as many as 150,000 Arizona voters could be affected.Vote by mail was widely practiced in Arizona long before the coronavirus pandemic took hold. The bill has faced a whiplash journey through the Arizona Legislature. The Arizona Senate previously approved the measure before the state House amended it and passed its version in April. The amended bill was expected to get final passage in the GOP-led state Senate last month.But the measure stalled following an intense back-and-forth over a highly controversial election audit between the bill's sponsor and another GOP lawmaker. After coming back to the Senate floor from caucusing on changes to the legislation, GOP state Sen. Kelly Townsend said she was voting against the legislation and any other election bills pending a Republican-backed audit of some of the state's mail-in ballots from the 2020 presidential election.The so-called audit ordered by the Senate began in April and has stretched into May, despite the election results already undergoing multiple reviews that had found no evidence of widespread fraud and ultimately being certified by state election officials. The audit -- which perpetuates the falsehood that the election was stolen from former President Donald Trump -- has been decried by both Maricopa County's Board of Supervisors, which is majority Republican, and the Arizona secretary of state, who is a Democrat. The US Justice Department issued a warning about the audit last week, saying the effort could be in violation of federal voting and civil rights laws.Though the review is still ongoing, Townsend voted in favor of the bill on Tuesday. \"I have been reassured because we are now looking into other issues,\" Townsend told her colleagues.",

The Trump administration had revoked Bensouda's US entry visa in 2019.The retaliatory moves by the Trump administration came after the ICC authorized a probe into alleged war crimes committed in Afghanistan by US and Afghan forces, as well as alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the Taliban. They  followed a push by Bensouda to investigate potential crimes committed by Israel against the Palestinians. She formally launched an investigation into into alleged war crimes by Israel in the Palestinian territories, as well as alleged war crimes by Palestinian militant groups like Hamas, in March of this year.The September 2020 sanctions were swiftly condemned by the international tribunal, human rights organizations and the foreign minister of the Netherlands, where the ICC is based.In his statement Friday, Blinken said they \"continue to disagree strongly with the ICC's actions relating to the Afghanistan and Palestinian situations.\"\"We maintain our longstanding objection to the Court's efforts to assert jurisdiction over personnel of non-States Parties such as the United States and Israel. We believe, however, that our concerns about these cases would be better addressed through engagement with all stakeholders in the ICC process rather than through the imposition of sanctions,\" he said.\"We are encouraged that States Parties to the Rome Statute are considering a broad range of reforms to help the Court prioritize its resources and to achieve its core mission of serving as a court of last resort in punishing and deterring atrocity crimes. We think this reform is a worthwhile effort,\" Blinken added. \"Our support for the rule of law, access to justice, and accountability for mass atrocities are important U.S. national security interests that are protected and advanced by engaging with the rest of the world to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow,\" he said.",

The Trump-era rule increased the likelihood of rejections amid other policies that choked off legal immigration, like suspending much of family-based immigration amid the pandemic and gutting asylum. Examples of fields that might be left blank include middle name, passport or travel document number, and \"other names used,\" according to the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \"We will not automatically reject your form if you leave a space blank.

The agency confirmed Thursday that for all forms it has reverted to the pre-Trump policy regarding blank responses.Describing the Trump-era policy, Moore said in a statement, \"USCIS implemented this intake process from October 2019 to December 2020 to improve operational efficiency and ensure the agency had all information we need to adjudicate an application or petition. Incomplete applications or petitions slow down processing by requiring us to issue Requests for Evidence (RFEs), which extends processing times for applicants in need of humanitarian protection.\"At the end of last year, the agency agreed to stop implementing the rejection policy for asylum applications and visa petitions for victims of certain crimes as a result of litigation, according to the American Immigration Lawyers Association.The reversal \"increases the predictability that these applications will be accepted and seriously considered, as they should, to consider whether an applicant qualifies for an immigration benefit,\" said Sarah Pierce, policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, who added that the Trump-era change \"increased the chances that an applicant would be dissuaded from applying again altogether.\" Pierce noted the reversal from the Trump-era policy is also likely beneficial to USCIS, since it eliminates the extra step of sending back an application because a part of a form isn't filled out, which can be quite common.",

The most recent version of the ban has been in effect since December 2017, and mostly targets Muslim-majority countries. The video campaign, organized by several immigrants from Iran, opens a window into the desperation of what one libertarian think tank estimated is more than 10,000 people from five Muslim-majority countries who have been kept from their loved ones since the ban took effect.Jessica Breitschwerdt Monfared with a photo of herself and her husband, Pouya Monfared.Many say they feel trapped in a bureaucratic limbo, hoping against hope to be granted one of the ban's waivers or exceptions. In practice, the State Department grants few waivers. According to data released by the department in February, during the first 11 months of the ban, through last October, only 5.9% of visa applicants were given a waiver, while another 29% were waiting in \"administrative processing.\"Read MoreThe State Department declined interview requests from CNN, but emailed a response stating, in part, that as of the end of January, \"2,673 applicants were cleared for waivers after a consular officer determined the applicants satisfied all criteria and completed required processing. Many of those applicants already have received their visas. The bases on which an applicant may be excepted from the Proclamation or qualify for a waiver are clearly explained in the Presidential Proclamation itself.\" Those waivers include ones for both immigrant and non-immigrant applicants, such as students and researchers -- a total pool of tens of thousands a year.The department didn't respond to questions about the process for issuing waivers. However, in a February 22 letter to Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, an official wrote that \"The burden of proof is on the alien to establish that they are eligible for a visa and a waiver to the satisfaction of the consular officer.\"A revised ban takes holdAfter Trump repeatedly said during his campaign that he would ban all Muslims from entering the US, federal courts cited his words in blocking the first two versions of his travel ban in 2017. In December 2017, the Supreme Court allowed a third version of the ban to go into effect, and it ultimately upheld the ban last June. That version severely restricted visas from a list of Muslim-majority countries -- Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen -- along with Venezuela and North Korea. Chad was removed from the list last April, after the White House said the country improved security measures.Under the ban, the State Department rejected more than 37,000 visa applications from citizens of the affected countries in 2018, compared with fewer than 1,000 such rejections a year earlier. About four out of ten of those rejections were for immigrant visas, according to federal data.On April 10, Democrats introduced a bill known as the \"No Ban Act\" in the House and Senate to overturn the ban, but the measure is not expected to pass the GOP-controlled Senate. Meanwhile, lawsuits challenging the ban continue.House, Senate Democrats introduce proposal to repeal Trump travel banOne key argument is that so few waivers are granted that \"the process has not been implemented in good faith,\" said Sirine Shebaya, interim legal director of Muslim Advocates, a Washington-based civil rights group involved in the litigation. \"I think Trump's animus towards Muslims continues to be strong evidence of discriminatory intent of policy,\" she said. Legally, however, she said, \"It's a weird landscape right now. We're not sure how it's going to play out.\"The White House, which declared after the original January 2017 proclamation that \"this is not a Muslim ban,\" has continued to claim that the ban is purely a national security measure. \"In this era of worldwide terrorism and extremist movements bent on harming innocent civilians, we must properly vet those coming into our country,\" Trump said in a statement after the Supreme Court upheld the ban. The State Department does not typically release data on visa applications or visa waivers by country, nor does it say how many people cleared for waivers actually get visas. CNN spoke to more than 40 applicants or spouses who said they'd gotten no answers in their individual cases either.\"You have to wait. How long? No one knows. Why? No one knows. Give me a time? A year? Five years? Ten years?\" said Ashkan Ghafari, 30, by phone. He works at a retail computer store in Tehran, Iran. He's been waiting 16 months for news about the visa he applied for in December 2017, just after he married his childhood friend Maryan Asadi Tari. The two had stayed in touch after she emigrated to Nashville, Tennessee, more than 12 years ago. \"Every day, I wake up and check for an email from the embassy regarding my case, but there's no news at all,\" he said.Sitting in limboThe near impossibility of getting a waiver has led desperate visa applicants to think creatively about how to press their cases.Shiva Farrokhi came to the US from Tehran six years ago to get her master's degree in industrial design. She and her husband, also an Iranian immigrant, got their green cards in November 2016, shortly before Trump took office. They live in Portland, Oregon, where for the past two years she has worked to launch a start-up video crowdsourcing site for collective action, called in-it.com.Shiva Farrokhi, founder of the in-it.com site, and her husband video chatted with friends and family abroad at their wedding in Los Angeles in 2016.\"We wanted to do a campaign, and what inspired me was the travel ban,\" Farrokhi said. \"I wanted to gather some video stories, but it was hard; people wouldn't really respond.\" Many feared that if they posted something, they might not get their visas, she said.Then Farrokhi saw a Facebook post about her old school friend Fereshteh Abbasi, who'd earned her Ph.D. in the US, gotten an H1B work visa, and married an American. Abbasi had moved with her husband to the Caribbean island nation of Grenada for him to attend medical school, only to be caught by the travel ban. Her immigrant visa application has been stuck for nine months in the limbo of administrative processing. Now her husband is close to finishing his degree, but she has no visa to return to the US with him.\"I thought, 'Oh, my God, her case is so awful,'\" Farrokhi said. \"I contacted her, asked, 'Do you know others?' She said, 'Yes, so many others, all on [the app] Telegram, they all communicate there and no one gets to see what they are saying, there's no exposure.'\"Abbasi confirmed this account. Starting last May, she said, she spent many hours on Telegram, helping other prospective immigrants with their questions, assisting them with translations for their visa applications. She took part in a letter-writing campaign to the justices on the US Supreme Court about the impact of the ban. Abbasi said she agreed to post a video herself and help Farrohki recruit for more.Fereshteh Abbasi moved with her American husband to Grenada for him to attend medical school, but now is stuck in administrative processing and is not cleared to return to the US. Soon afterward, Abbasi helped Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian connect with another member of the Telegram group, Yahya Abedi, in Tehran. Abedi ran one of the three chat groups on Telegram, in Farsi. He, too, was involved in the letter-writing campaign. And he, too, was in limbo.After a courtship that started on Instagram, in February 2016 Abedi had married Olivia Cross, an American pre-med student at the University of Michigan. Before the travel ban, he'd likely have received his spousal visa after about a year. But at that point, in January of this year, he'd been stuck in administrative processing for 18 months.On January 29, the Post published an opinion piece about the plight of the separated, with a video that profiled Cross and her frustrating wait. Nine days after it ran, the State Department abruptly granted Abedi an exception and issued him a visa. Two weeks later, he arrived in the US.Word spread by Telegram like wildfire.\"After that article, we got like 30 videos posted to the site in two days,\" said Farrokhi.Today, the Telegram and in.it communities remain eager for media attention, hoping it might spur the State Department to take action on individual cases. At my request, Abbasi put out word on Telegram that a reporter from CNN was reaching out about the ban. In less than 48 hours, I received 100 emails and messages from people desperate to tell their stories:Shamim Darchini, 25, says she's a US citizen whose husband, a dentist in northern Iran, has been waiting 21 months since his visa interview in Dubai. Darchini is set to start pharmacy school this fall at University of California San Diego, but she said she's struggling with the ever-longer separation. \"I don't know,\" she said, \"it's hard for me to manage these things. Right now, I'm crying and depressed.\"Mohammed said he's a US citizen from Syria. He asked that his last name not be used because he works for the US military as a trainer and wants to avoid any risk to his wife, a Syrian refugee in Turkey. They married in Beirut in May 2017, and they have been seeking a visa for her since then. He said he expects little change unless Trump is voted out of office in 2020. \"If I think about two more years, I think I will die. Without hope, it's not possible. I am hoping for a miracle,\" he said.Emad Kazerani, who said he's a US citizen and a software developer at Bank of America who lives in New Jersey, met his Iranian fianc\u00e9e, Raziyeh Aghakhanikhanghah, through her sister. After eight months of getting to know each other online, he traveled to Shiraz, Iran, in July 2017 to meet her in person. They became engaged that August and filed for a visa in October. Before her visa interview in Ankara, Turkey, in July 2018, they put together 624 pages of documents to support her case for a waiver -- but she remains in administrative processing. \"We want to marry, but we can't,\" Kazerani said. \"Our fianc\u00e9 visa application would become void and we'd have to start the whole process again. We want to have kids, but we can't until we're married.\" Emad Kazerani and his fiancee, Raziyeh Aghakhanikhanghah, who is seeking a visa but stuck in administrative processing. Others separated by the ban include a Baha'i couple who say they fled religious persecution in Iran (she's in the US; he's a refugee in Turkey); a gay couple who married in South Africa (one is a permanent resident in the US, the other awaits a US visa in Iran, where same-sex relationships are punishable by death); and many, many more.Still, news media attention is no guarantor of success. Ricky Smith, a civil engineer in Milwaukee, was featured in the same Washington Post story and video as Olivia Cross. But he and his wife, Mona Khorasani, who married in March 2018, are still waiting for her visa. Smith said his attorney told him that \"one of the best things I could do is generate publicity because the State Department doesn't like attention being brought to these difficult situations.\"Smith reached out to a local Milwaukee TV station. Their story led to a front-page feature in the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, \"and that's how the Washington Post ended up finding me,\" Smith said. But, so far, it hasn't helped. Smith noted that before the ban, Khorasani had traveled to the US repeatedly on tourist visas. She has lived for six years in Canada, where she works for a pharmaceutical services company in Toronto.\"We file a joint return,\" Smith said. \"I am paying taxes for my wife's income to a country she's banned from.\"\"It's sad. It's upsetting,\" he added. \"I can't believe that my own government is preventing me from having a life with my wife because of the place she was born in, and that the Supreme Court said that was OK. That's really what I find hard to deal with.\"Fereshteh Abbasi, too, thought being featured in The Guardian on March 1 might give her case a boost. \"I was hoping ... but no,\" she said. \"His medical school ends May 17. We were scheduled to move back to the US May 29.\" Her visa for Grenada expires in July. \"I'm really screwed if I have to live here longer,\" she said.Like many of those waiting, Abbasi assiduously tracks whatever data she can glean on the waivers. She called the process \"sketchy.\"A waiver process that some call a 'sham'Some former State Department officers who've seen the process from the inside are even more critical than that. When the Trump administration issued its first travel-ban executive order in early 2017, more than 900 State Department officials signed a dissent memorandum opposing the policy, saying it \"will not achieve its aim of making our country safer,\" and \"runs counter to core American values.\"Chris Richardson, who subsequently resigned as a foreign-service officer in March 2018, submitted a sworn affidavit last year in one federal lawsuit challenging the ban. In that affidavit, he said that consular officers understood they were to prevent people from applying for waivers, that they were not allowed to issue waivers to people who did qualify for them, and that they had to send any such cases to superiors in Washington.\"I am of the mind it is still a sham,\" he said by phone. \"This process is different from any other type of waiver we have\" in taking approval out of the hands of officers in the field. \"If you wanted to design a waiver process that was truly fair, consular officers could make those decisions themselves,\" he said.State Department rejects more than 37,000 visas under Trump's travel banSarah Gardiner resigned from her position as a consular officer at the US embassy in Madrid in October 2017.Under the third version of the ban, Gardiner said, she heard from other consular officers that they \"felt pressure, if not a tacit understanding, to approve as few folks as possible for waivers,\" she said. \"In Spain, we didn't deal with the numbers other posts deal with, but we dealt with enough.\"\"It's really wrecking a lot of people's lives,\" she said. Initially, she noted, there was a significant public backlash to the ban, but now \"as reworked and sanitized by layers of bureaucracy, and with people distracted by next terrible thing ... it can be easy to forget it's all happening.\"Elizabeth Shackelford, who now lives in Vermont and is working on a book on South Sudan, resigned in December 2017 from her position as a State Department political officer in Somalia.  The ban, she said, \"made no sense. It was practically impossible to get a visa from Somalia anyway, so there was no real impact -- it was just a punch in the face to our partners.\"Richardson now works as an immigration attorney in Atlanta. To him, he said, the bottom line is clear: Trump \"said he was going to do a total shutdown of Muslims coming into the country, and we're pretending he didn't say that.\"In response to these accounts, a State Department spokesperson said that the department could not comment on litigation. \"However, we would like to reiterate that the Proclamation lays out a clear set of criteria for the granting of waivers,\" the official added.On the political front, progress is slow. Farrokhi, who started the in-it travel ban project in hopes it would bring the issue to the attention of not just the public but also members of Congress, was thrilled to give a presentation on the video campaign in early February in Washington to staff members of newly elected Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minnesota. Omar, who immigrated from Somalia with her family as a child after four years in a refugee camp in Kenya, and who became a US citizen in 2000, called the ban \"a moral stain on our country's history\" at a ceremony announcing the No Ban Act. She tweeted out a link to an in-it video last week, and told CNN that she considers the video campaign \"a wonderful way to ... talk about the impact the ban has had on many of our community members.\" Whatever happens with the No Ban Act bill, Farrokhi said she hopes that, like her video campaign, it helps remind people about how the ban is continuing to affect ordinary people. \"People talk about immigration reform, but the travel ban is not really part of that conversation, and it's almost forgotten. We don't want this ban to become normalized and part of US immigration laws forever,\" she said.

        "content": "Orlando, Florida (CNN)The first thing some of the women were asked to do when they got to the house parties in the gated community in suburban Orlando was to put away their cellphones, according to two women in attendance who spoke to CNN in recent days. The men inside, a who's who of local Republican officials that often included Rep. Matt Gaetz, did not want the night's activities documented. The partygoers, at times dressed in formal wear from a political event they'd just left, mingled and shared drugs like cocaine and ecstasy. Some had sex.Gaetz, the brash Republican, liked to discuss politics, said one of the women. He behaved like a \"frat type of party boy,\" she said, sometimes taking pills she believed were recreational drugs. Details of the parties, which have not been previously reported, were described to CNN by two women who attended several of them over the past few years. Both spoke on condition of anonymity.The behavior of Gaetz and the other high-powered men at the events, and a pattern of digital payments that followed, will likely be items of interest to the Justice Department as part of its probe of Gaetz that includes allegations of sex trafficking and prostitution.  Read MoreFederal investigators are examining whether Gaetz engaged in a relationship with a woman that began when she was 17, according to people familiar with the investigation. The investigators have also pursued allegations from witnesses and other evidence that Gaetz may have used cash and drugs in his dealings with the young women.After some parties, money would change hands. According to receipts reviewed by CNN, Gaetz and his associate Joel Greenberg, a former county tax commissioner indicted last year on multiple federal charges, used digital payment applications to send hundreds of dollars to at least one woman who attended the parties.The receipts viewed by CNN record payments that took place between 2018 and 2019 and include at least one that indicated in a label that it was to compensate for travel.Gaetz showed nude photos of women he said he'd slept with to lawmakers, sources tell CNN  One of the women said she received money from Greenberg after some of the parties. She said that some of the payments were for providing sex but would not say who she slept with. She did say she never received money directly from Gaetz.Some of the parties were more low-key affairs, the other woman said. Some took place in hotel suites at the end of alcohol-filled political functions.\"No one ever wants to stop partying, stop drinking, once you've had a few glasses of champagne in you,\" she said.A spokesman for Gaetz did not respond directly to CNN's request for comment but challenged the use of anonymous sources.According to people familiar with the investigation, authorities have spoken with some of the women involved with the congressman and his close friend, Greenberg, the former tax commissioner in Seminole County, Florida, who is currently facing 33 federal charges, including sex trafficking of a minor.One of the women who spoke to CNN said she did so in part because the picture of Gaetz as potentially connected to sex trafficking that has emerged in recent days does not align with what she saw. Both women said that they never saw anyone at the parties who appeared to be underage. Neither has spoken with federal investigators, they said.Congressman Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., speaks at a \"Women for American First\" event  Friday, April 9, 2021, in Doral, Florida.Gaetz has denied ever paying for sex and over the past two weeks has sought to frame the allegations against him as the result of political bias in the justice system and the media.He has also accused investigators of twisting his generosity towards women into something criminal.  \"Providing for flights and hotel rooms for people that you're dating who are of legal age is not a crime,\" Gaetz said in an interview with Fox News late last month.The New York Times first reported that Gaetz made digital payments to women, and last Thursday, The Daily Beast also reported on Venmo transactions between Gaetz and Greenberg, and Greenberg and young women.  Greenberg has been providing investigators with information since last year, including about encounters he and Gaetz had with women who were given cash or gifts in exchange for sex, a source familiar with the case confirms to CNN. Greenberg has met several times with investigators, and his cooperation, which was first reported by The New York Times, could put additional legal pressure on Gaetz as investigators work to determine whether he broke sex-trafficking or prostitution laws himself.Last week, Greenberg's attorney and a federal prosecutor told a judge that Greenberg would likely enter into a plea agreement in the coming weeks, possibly giving the Justice Department even more access to a witness with intimate knowledge of any potential wrongdoing by Gaetz.  Speaking to reporters after the Thursday hearing last week, Fritz Scheller, Greenberg's attorney, declined to say if his client would be willing to cooperate as part of the potential plea deal and would not divulge if Greenberg had already met with prosecutors to describe what he knows about Gaetz.He added, however, that his client is \"uniquely situated.\"\"I'm sure Matt Gaetz is not feeling very comfortable today,\" Scheller said  Scheller declined to comment to CNN for this story.  The investigation of Gaetz began in the closing months of the Trump-era Justice Department under then-Attorney General William Barr and was initially part of a broader probe into trafficking allegations against Greenberg.As part of the ongoing probe, investigators are scrutinizing Gaetz's connections to several associates in Florida who may have benefited politically in return for providing the congressman favors including escorts, travel, and campaign donations, according to the sources familiar with the investigation.  One event in focus is a trip that Gaetz took to the Bahamas with friends and young women, CNN has reported. Investigators are seeking to determine whether Gaetz was provided travel and women in exchange for political favors as part of their broader probe, the sources said.A former member of the Florida House of Representatives and the son of a powerful figure in Republican state politics, Gaetz cultivated a tight-knit circle of politically connected friends who stayed in his orbit after he went to Washington in 2017.'He really jumped on the Trump train': How a brash Matt Gaetz climbed the ranks in Trump's Washington In recent days, a number of those allies have been drawn into the scandal. Chris Dorworth, a former state legislator whom Gaetz has described as a friend and \"legislative mentor,\" stepped down from his post at a high-powered lobbying firm on Friday, a day after The New York Times reported that he had spoken with Gaetz about running a third-party candidate in a local election -- which could be considered a violation of campaign finance laws if the third-party candidate were secretly paid for running. \"The current political environment is nasty, and I told Brian I don't think it's fair for the recent media storm to take away from their missions,\" Dorworth wrote on Twitter, referencing Brian Ballard, the founder of the Florida-based lobbying group with close ties to the administration of former President Donald Trump.  Dorworth told CNN on Wednesday that he did not recall talking with Gaetz about running a third candidate and pointed out that he didn't believe it would have been illegal if it did occur. He did not respond to CNN's request for comment on his resignation.  So far, Greenberg appears to be the only person in Gaetz' orbit who is currently facing charges related to the scandal. First indicted in 2020 over the alleged stalking of a political rival, Greenberg has since been accused by federal prosecutors of unlawfully accessing a motor vehicle database to obtain and use the personal information of people including some who he \"was engaged in 'sugar daddy' relationships\" with.Then-Seminole County tax collector Joel Greenberg leaves the federal courthouse in Orlando following his indictment on a federal stalking charge on June 23, 2020.  According to a person close to Greenberg, the former tax commissioner regularly sent identically worded messages to multiple women inviting them to parties through so-called sugar daddy dating websites, where men connect with women that they usually compensate with money or gifts. Few details about the sex trafficking of a minor charge levied at Greenberg last year have been revealed to the public, but in an August indictment, prosecutors said the minor was between the ages of 14 and 17 years old and accused Greenberg of unlawfully obtaining a photograph and driver identification number for the person.People close to both Greenberg and Gaetz have described them as good friends whose connection was as much about Republican Party politics in Florida as after-hours socializing.Greenberg, a newcomer to elected office when he won the county seat in 2016, enjoyed the political status he gained from friendships with Gaetz and other lawmakers, the people close to the men said.Out of the public eye, Greenberg would boast to friends that he was partying with Gaetz and women, according to the person close to Greenberg.For his part, Gaetz appeared to have found an ally in Greenberg, donating $1,000 to one of his campaigns, and promoting him for higher office in an interview.\"If Joel were to run from Seminole Co, I think he'd become the next congressman from the 7th district,\" Gaetz told a Florida radio station in 2017.That relationship is now being tested. Gaetz, in turn, has boosted his defense team, late last week hiring two New York lawyers, including Marc Mukasey, a former federal prosecutor who has also represented the Trump Organization.This story has been updated with additional reporting about Greenberg providing investigators with information since last year, as well as to include comments from Dorworth.",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)The political organization founded by NBA superstar LeBron James and a host of other Black athletes and artists will kick off its post-2020 work with a focus on the wave of Republican-backed legislation aimed at restricting voter access in the wake of the latest presidential election.More Than A Vote will use the 2021 NBA All-Star Game in Atlanta to draw attention to recent efforts by Republican lawmakers in Georgia to make it harder for people to vote by pushing for restrictive election laws. The group is kicking off a campaign named Protect Our Power, which, in addition to fighting these laws in states across the country, will look to mobilize Black voters in off-year and municipal elections.The new program will be punctuated by a new ad campaign voiced by James himself, in which the NBA icon argues that the success his group and others had at registering and turning out voters during the 2020 election led directly to Republicans looking to make it more difficult to vote.\"Look what we did. Look what we made happen. What our voices made possible,\" James says as images and video of activism ahead of the 2020 elections plays. \"And now, look what they're trying to do to silence us. Using every trick in the book. And attacking democracy itself. Because they saw what we're capable of and they fear it.\"He adds: \"So this isn't the time to put your feet up or to think posting hashtags and black squares is enough. Because for us, this was never about one election. It's always been More Than A Vote. It's a fight that's just getting started. And we've been ready. You with us?\"Read MoreThe group said that a 30-second cut of the ad will premier during coverage of the All-Star Game on Sunday. The ad will be part of a broader focus on voting rights during the All-Star Game -- the group announced earlier in the week that they have partnered with the NBA and the players union to highlight attacks on voting around the game.\"We are in a position to let the world know and, in particular, let people who are new to the process or not as engaged with politics know, that these fights around voter suppression don't just take place during an election year,\" said Addisu Demissie, the executive director of More Than A Vote.Michael Tyler, a spokesman for the group, added that they want to make clear that while \"there has been a change of leadership at the federal level, in order to secure lasting justice, people have to maintain a sense of engagement at the local and state level year in and year out.\"A secondary goal for the group is to signal to people that the kind of activism they saw from athletes during former President Donald Trump's administration would not be ending with his loss.\"We called ourselves more than a vote for a reason,\" said Demissie. \"This is us planting the flag that athletes being activists is not just going to stop because the 2020 election cycle is over.\"Republican lawmakers, spurred on by Trump's repeated false claims about fraud in the 2020 election, have begun to push restrictive voting changes across the country, with the Republican State Leadership Committee leading the charge to roll back provisions that expanded the vote in key states. The group claims their aim is to \"restore the American people's confidence in the integrity of their free and fair elections\" by \"making it easier to vote and harder to cheat,\" parroting Trump's baseless claims.The Brennan Center for Justice found last month that more than 250 bills aimed at limiting voter access have been filed since the election.More Than A Vote will begin with a focus on Georgia, a state that became a leading battleground after Joe Biden became the first Democratic presidential nominee since 1992 to win there in November and both US Senate elections were won by Democrats in January. The group will partner with Black Voters Matter Fund, Fair Fight Action, Georgia NAACP and the New Georgia Project.The plan, said group organizers, is to expand work done in Georgia to other states where stricter voting laws may be passed, including Pennsylvania, Florida and Arizona.\"Black and brown voters changed the game in 2020, so in response, lawmakers are trying to change the rules in 2021,\" said Renee Montgomery, a WNBA player who opted to forgo the 2020 season to focus on social justice. Montgomery became a More Than A Vote member and is now a co-owner of the Atlanta Dream, her former team.\"We know that as athletes and as leaders we have to keep our foot on the gas to protect our power, preserve and expand our voting rights, and to continue turning moments into momentum,\" she said. \"More Than a Vote is just getting started.\"More Than A Vote was founded in the run-up to the 2020 election, providing James and others with a vehicle to help register Black voters and turn them out in the November election. The group currently boasts dozens of professional athletes and artists as members, including NFL quarterback Patrick Mahomes, American tennis star Sloane Stephens and comedian Kevin Hart.James has long been one of the nation's most politically active and outspoken athletes and he used his platform to routinely criticize Trump. The basketball star recently got into a spat with Swedish soccer star Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who said athletes like James should stay out of politics.James responded by saying he would \"never shut up about things that are wrong\" and that there is \"no way I would ever just stick to sports, because I understand how powerful this platform and my voice is.\"",

LIVE UPDATESPolice took the suspect into custody at the store Monday afternoon, less than an hour after panicked 911 callers told dispatchers of the killings unfolding there.Here's what we know about the Boulder shooting suspectAlissa, who at some point was shot in the leg Monday, was booked Tuesday into county jail after being treated at a hospital, authorities said. Officers described his wound as a \"through and through\" gunshot wound to his upper right thigh, according to an affidavit from Boulder County. It wasn't clear who shot him, Boulder Police Chief Maris Herold said.Read MoreAlissa will have his first court appearance at 8:15 a.m. (10:15 a.m. ET) Thursday, according to Colorado Judicial Branch online records.The motive in the Boulder killings -- one of several mass shootings in the US over the past week -- isn't immediately known, and the investigation will take a long time, authorities said. Still, investigators believe he was the only perpetrator, they said.\"I promise that all of us here will work tirelessly ... to make sure that the killer is held absolutely and fully accountable for what he did,\" Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said Tuesday at a news conference in Boulder.Police on Tuesday also released the names of those killed: Denny Stong, 20; Neven Stanisic, 23; Rikki Olds, 25; Tralona Bartkowiak, 49; Suzanne Fountain, 59; Teri Leiker, 51; Boulder police Officer Eric Talley, 51; Kevin Mahoney, 61; Lynn Murray, 62; Jody Waters, 65.A young grocery store manager and a heroic officer were among the 10 Boulder shooting victimsThe suspect has \"lived most of his life in the United States,\" Dougherty said Tuesday, without elaborating.The shootings in Boulder, home to the University of Colorado's main campus nestled by the Rocky Mountains northwest of Denver, came less than a week after shootings at three spas in the Atlanta area left eight people dead.In the past week alone, the United States has seen at least seven shootings, in each of which at least four people were injured or killed. Witnesses describe terror and panicWitnesses have described scenes of terror and panic at the supermarket Monday.The affidavit states Boulder police 911 dispatch received multiple calls. One caller told dispatchers the shooter shot out the window of a car and chased a man toward the street. Other callers said the shooter was wearing \"an armored vest.\" Multiple callers said they were hiding in the store.

Montoya and a fellow pharmacist then ran into a counseling room and hid under a desk. The two of them called 911 and stayed under the desk for about an hour. They didn't realize how close the shooter was until police announced they had the building surrounded and they heard him right outside the pharmacy.\"They found his weapons right by the pharmacy,\" she said, adding that she heard the shooter say: \"I surrender. I'm naked.\" Walking out of the grocery store was when it hit Montoya. She said she saw Olds' body. \"And that's when it all crashed down,\" she said. \"It all came crashing down, seeing someone I knew dead, that wasn't going to be able to walk out to her family.\"This image shows police escorting Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa from the supermarket, according to his brother.Ryan Borowski told CNN he was grabbing a bag of chips and a soda when he heard the first shot and saw a terrified woman running toward him. By the third shot, he was running with her toward the back of the store.They and others gathered with employees in the back.\"I saw a lot of very wide eyes. ... The employees in the back of the house didn't know what was going on, so we told them that there was a shooter, and they told us where the exit was,\" he told CNN on Tuesday.Images from the scene -- from a livestreamer and from CNN affiliate KMGH -- recorded police escorting from the building a shirtless man with blood on his leg, with his hands apparently cuffed.That man was the arrested suspect, Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, his brother Ali Aliwi Alissa told CNN Tuesday.Police officer and store manager among those killedThe slain officer, Talley, was one of the first to respond to the scene, according to Herold.  Witnesses told dispatchers they reported seeing the shooter shoot at police, the affidavit said. Officers had exchanged gunfire with Alissa at the store, Herold said.Officers wrote that Talley was down and had to be dragged out by SWAT officers, the affidavit said. Officers reported Talley had a gunshot wound to the head.Officer who responded to a mass shooting in Boulder was killed. He leaves behind seven childrenTalley joined the Boulder police force in 2010, she said. Talley, a father of seven children ages 5 to 18, once had a different profession and \"didn't have to go into policing, but he felt a higher calling,\" Herold said Tuesday.\"He cared about this community ... and he was willing to die to protect others,\" she said.Olds, 25, of Lafayette, was a front-end manager at the store, her uncle, Bob Olds, told CNN.She was a \"strong, independent young woman\" who was raised by her grandparents, Bob Olds said. \"She was so energetic and charismatic and she was a shining light in this dark world,\" he told CNN. Olds and another victim were graduates of Boulder-area high schools, said Rob Anderson, superintendent of  the Boulder Valley School District.Olds was a 2013 graduate of Centaurus High School and Denny Stong was a 2019 graduate of Fairview High School, Anderson's statement read.\"Several of the other victims were parents of our graduates and given the fact that this is a close knit community, there will likely be many other connections to BVSD schools both amongst those who were killed and other victims,\" Anderson said.'Gun, gun, gun! Run, run, run!' Grocery store witnesses describe the deadly rampage in ColoradoKroger, which owns King Soopers, said Tuesday three of the victims were employees: Denny Stong, Rikki Olds and Teri Leiker.\"In the hours since the shooting, we're learning of truly heroic acts that included associates, customers, and first responders selflessly helping to protect and save others. We will remain forever grateful to the first responders who so bravely responded to protect our associates and customers,\" the company's statement read. King Soopers in Boulder will remain closed while the shooting is being investigated, Kroger said.Suzanne Fountain \"was a person who all of her life really was about doing service, helping others,\" her longtime friend Helen Forster told CNN's Erin Burnett. Forster said she met Fountain during a community theater production in the late 1980s and later hired her to work at her non-profit organization, where Fountain worked for 17 years.\"She would be the first person that people would see when they walked in the door of the non-profit building that we operate, and she just would take care of everybody. She was calm and reassuring when things were stressful,\" Forster said.Forster said Fountain also worked at a local hospital for a number of years and later became a Medicare consultant, helping seniors.\"I think we're still a little bit in shock, and we're stunned. And I think we just have to take one day at a time and remember what she did for all of us,\" Forster said. \"You hold someone in your heart, whether they're on the planet or not, you know. So, I think that that's what a lot of us will be doing moving forward.\"Stong was a \"wise young man,\" according to his coworker Logan Ezra Smith.\"Me and him were both big Second Amendment supporters and would go shooting on the weekends,\" Smith said. \"I will miss his smile and his laugh but as well as his honesty. He put you in your place.\"What authorities say happenedPolice said they were called there about gunfire around 2:40 p.m. (4:40 p.m. ET) Monday.Ambulances and officers from several law enforcement agencies arrived at the store, part of a large shopping center with a two-story strip mall next door. In scanner traffic, officers radioed that they were in a gunfight. They reported being fired at with multiple rounds through at least 3:21 p.m. local time.Boulder Police released this booking photo of shooting suspect Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa.A SWAT team responded to the scene, the affidavit said. An officer says they saw the shooter walking backward toward the SWAT team to be taken into custody. The shooter \"removed all of his clothing and was dressed only in shorts.\" Alissa did not answer officers questions about other suspects, but he did ask to speak to his mother, the affidavit said. The suspect was taken into custody at 3:28 p.m., Herold said. There was no indication of alcohol or drug use, the affidavit said. An AR-15-style pistol, modified with an arm brace, was used in the shooting, a senior law enforcement source told CNN on condition of anonymity. A search of the suspect's home turned up other weapons, the source said.Police respond to the King Soopers grocery store in Boulder after a gunman opened fire Monday.\"A photograph of the items that the male removed on scene included a green tactical vest, a rifle (possible AR-15), a semiautomatic handgun, a pair of jeans and a dark colored long-sleeved shirt. There was much blood around the items,\" the affidavit said. Calls for action against gun violenceOn the heels of March 16's three spa shootings in Atlanta, the latest attack stoked calls for action and expressions of fear.Colorado Gov. Jared Polis told CNN's Pamela Brown on Tuesday he thought the case will be \"pretty easy\" to prosecute because of there are many witnesses. At the same time, though, Polis said no matter what the shooter's motive was, it will not make sense to anyone. \"This is just where everybody goes to pick up groceries,\" Polis said. \"Never ever does it cross your mind that that trip to the grocery store could be your last moments on earth.\"Polis said he has ordered flags to fly at half-staff for 10 days to honor the 10 victims.  He also told CNN he has spoken with President Joe Biden, who on Tuesday called for stricter gun laws.\"I don't need to wait another minute, let alone an hour, to take commonsense steps that will save lives in the future. And I encourage my colleagues in the House and Senate to act,\" Biden said.Biden called for specific legislative moves, including the banning of assault weapons and high-capacity weapons. He also called for closing of loopholes in the US background check system, including the \"Charleston loophole,\" which allows some firearms to be transferred by licensed gun dealers before the required background checks are completed.\"This is not -- it should not be a partisan issue. This is an American issue. It will save lives, American lives. We have to act,\" Biden said.  A trip to the spa that ended in death. These are some of the victims of the Atlanta-area shootingsColorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said in a statement Tuesday, \"We need to do better to avoid mass shootings in our state and nation.\"We have grappled with this issue in Colorado and the conversation about how to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people will continue. For now, we all need to rise to the occasion to support the people of Colorado, and each other, as we always have.\"Denver Nuggets head coach Mike Malone was brought to tears Tuesday at a pregame media session. \"I'm just heartbroken for them and everybody else. Hopefully we as a country, we as a state, can find a way to be better,\" he said. The National Rifle Association quoted the Constitution's Second Amendment in a tweet Monday: \"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\"Correction: An earlier version of this story misspelled victim Denny Stong's last name based on information provided by the Boulder Police Department.CNN's Konstantin Toropin, Alisha Ebrahimji, Steve Almasy, Paul P.

Officers had exchanged gunfire with him at the store, but it wasn't clear who shot him, Herold said.Here's what we know about the Boulder, Colorado, mass shooting suspectHe was treated for his injury at a hospital, but by Tuesday he had been booked into a county jail on 10 counts of murder in the first degree, police said.Investigators don't have information about a motive. Still, they believe he was the only perpetrator, authorities said at a news conference Tuesday.The suspect has \"lived most of his life in the United States,\" Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said, without elaborating. \"In terms of statements that he (Alissa) may have made to investigators ... we're collecting those statements now, and we'll be providing those in the weeks ahead,\" Dougherty said.This image shows police escorting Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa from the supermarket Monday, according to this brother.A Ruger AR-556 pistol, modified with an arm brace, was used in the shooting, a senior law enforcement source told CNN on condition of anonymity. The gunman also was carrying a 9mm handgun, according to the source.Alissa had bought a Ruger AR-556 pistol less than a week earlier, on March 16, police wrote in the affidavit, citing law enforcement databases.A search of the suspect's home turned up other weapons, the senior law enforcement source said.Images from the scene on Monday -- from a livestreamer and from CNN affiliate KMGH -- showed police escorting from the building a shirtless man with blood on his leg, with his hands apparently cuffed.That man was the arrested suspect, Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, his brother, Ali Aliwi Alissa, told CNN.Sarah Moonshadow is comforted by David and Maggie Talley after Moonshadow was inside King Soopers grocery store.Ahmad Alissa was sentenced to one year of probation and 48 hours of community service after pleading guilty to third-degree assault in 2018 for an incident that occurred in November 2017. He was accused of attacking a classmate at his Denver area high school, according to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation's database.Where does the investigation go next?Alissa will have his first court appearance at 8:15 a.m. MT on Thursday, according to Colorado Judicial Branch online records.It is unclear whether Alissa will personally appear since a court document noted that \"the Defendant and counsel shall appear personally unless Defendant waives, in writing, his right to appear personally.\"The hearing is meant to advise Alissa of the charges he is facing, his rights and the next court date, according to a statement from the Boulder County district attorney.Police, meanwhile, will be on the shooting scene day and night to learn more about the violence that took place at the store, officials said.\"We will work around the clock to get this accomplished,\" Herold said.A law enforcement official told CNN that the FBI continues to look at everything from the suspect's online activity to interviews with his friends and relatives.The official said Alissa was not previously the subject of any FBI investigation and says it appears nothing in the federal system would have prohibited Alissa from buying a firearm.Analysis: Mass shootings signal a dubious 'back to normal' in AmericaThe killings come less than a week after three spa shootings in Atlanta, in which eight people were killed.In the last week, the United States has had at least seven shootings in which at least four people were injured or killed. Gov. Jared Polis told CNN's Pamela Brown on Tuesday that public information officers have been assigned as the point of contact for victims' families.\"I've made it known ... that when they're ready to take my call, I will of course convey the remembrance the people of Colorado have for the 10 victims,\" he said.Polis said he has ordered flags to fly half-staff for 10 days to honor the 10 victims.

The shooter entered the store Monday afternoon and opened fire, killing 10 people -- including the first Boulder police officer to arrive on the scene.While families agonized for hours waiting to learn the fate of their missing loved ones, several survivors described the surreal attack.'I just nearly got killed for getting a soda'When the gunfire started, some customers were confused.Read More\"Maybe somebody dropped something,\" Ryan Borowski said. \"The second shot came. And then after that, it was, 'Bam, bam, bam!' And I was running.\"A young grocery store manager and a heroic officer were among the 10 Boulder shooting victimsHe and others bolted and \"busted through the back doors to the employee area,\" Borowski said. \"The employees looked at us with shock,\" he said. \"We had to tell them, 'Gun, gun, gun! Run, run, run!' And they made sure we didn't go down any dead ends.\" Customers and employees worked together to quickly navigate the twists and turns in the back of the grocery store. \"We were all running, single file, finding our way through the maze of the back of the house,\" Borowski said. \"I had my hand on somebody else's back, and somebody had their hand on my back, so nobody was tripping or falling.\" Live updates: Grocery store shooting leaves 10 deadAbout a dozen people managed to escape with him out a back door, ducking underneath a trailer before reaching safety, he said.Later, he realized safety is never guaranteed.\"Boulder feels like a bubble, and the bubble burst,\" Borowski said. \"This feels like the safest spot in America, and I just nearly got killed for getting a soda and a bag of chips.\"A woman is killed in front of children Steven McHugh's son-in-law was third in line for a Covid-19 vaccine when the shooter came in and killed the woman at the front of the line. McHugh's two granddaughters were with their father and were on the phone to their grandmother. The grandmother heard about eight shots over the phone before the dad grabbed the two girls and ran upstairs, hiding in a coat closet for 45 minutes. After another mass shooting, these survivors stand ready to help the victims' families\"They were right there, from the first shot to the last,\" McHugh said.Along with the scale of the tragedy, McHugh worries about the lasting impact on his grandchildren.\"The intensity and awfulness is going to last with them for the rest of their lives,\" he said.\"No family should ever have to go through this again in the United States.\"A friend texts: 'Thank you for everything'Andrew Hummel \"heard a loud bang, and then everybody kind of sprinted toward the back of the store,\" he told CNN affiliate KMGH.\"I didn't see anything; I could just hear ... and I just ran -- I just wanted to get out of there,\" Hummel said. The Colorado attack is the 7th mass shooting in the US in 7 days\"There was so much going on in such a compact area.\"As soon as Hummel got out, he called his parents and his friend and roommate, Mason, who works at the store, he said.His first priority was making sure Mason got out safe. He later learned Mason was hiding in a storage room with other customers.\"One of the biggest scary texts he sent, he just said, 'I love you guys. Thank you for everything in case things go bad.' That was a really hard text, especially me being in this situation,\" Hummel said. \"That was something I would never want to hear from any of my friends. It was horrifying. It was truly horrifying.\"Quiet, then random shots of fire -- and store musicMaggie Montoya, a pharmacy technician, was signing up people for Covid-19 vaccine shots when she heard the first gunshot.Her store manager was first in line for the shot, and the manager yelled out \"active shooter, and we all just scattered,\" Montoya told CNN's Anderson Cooper. Montoya took shelter in the counseling room, next to the pharmacy, she said, hiding under a desk. She heard more gunshots and some screaming, she said. \"Then it was just quiet for a long time with just the store music and random shots of fire throughout the store,\" Montoya said.Both she and the pharmacist called 911, but as the shooting continued, Montoya said she hung up and dialed her family instead. \"Hey, I just want to let you guys know there's an active shooter in the store. I love you,\" Montoya said she told her parents.After about an hour, when police announced they had surrounded the building, Montoya said they heard the shooter just outside the pharmacy: \"I surrender. I'm naked,\" he said, according to Montoya. \"They found his weapons right by the pharmacy,\" she said.As Montoya walked out of the store, she saw bloody footprints leading from the pharmacy out the door, she said.And she saw the body of Rikki Olds, a front-end manager of the store. \"And that's when it all crashed down ... It all came crashing down seeing someone I knew dead, that wasn't going to be able to walk out to her family,\" Montoya said.People in other businesses hear the shotsJessica Crumby was lying on a table in a tattoo shop in the same shopping center as King Soopers when she heard about four gunshots. \"All of a sudden we just heard 'pop, pop, crack, crack,'\" she said. \"We kind of stopped what we were doing, and we heard some glass shattering.\" Crumby went outside and saw a nearby yoga studio's window \"looked like it had been shot in.\" She saw people running out of King Soopers and heard sirens in the background. Within minutes, chaosAnna Haynes lives in an apartment across from the grocery store, and can see all of the front  from her living room window. When she heard about 10 gunshots, Haynes thought it was fireworks or a \"car engine failing,\" and she looked out the window \"expecting to see something like that.\"\"Instead, I saw a body in the middle of the parking lot,\" the University of Colorado Boulder student told CNN via Skype.Haynes said she saw the shooter on his way to the store entrance when he turned around and started \"shooting rapid fire at one particular target. I'm fairly sure it was a person.\"The shooter then entered the store through the entrance for those with disabilities, she said, \"And a few seconds later I saw people running out of the building. I heard screaming.\"\"It just devolved into chaos within just a couple of minutes.\" A neighbor glimpses what might have beenA SWAT team member runs toward the supermarket where a gunman opened fire.At an apartment complex near the grocery store, a man named Ben was inside his apartment when the gunfire started.\"I didn't think much of it because it was all muffled from in my apartment,\" he told CNN affiliate KCNC. Later, when he looked outside the window, he saw dozens of police officers -- including some from surrounding cities. And he saw 10 to 12 people being taken to a bus, he told KCNC.What we know about the Boulder mass shooting suspect\"They pulled out a guy who had no shirt on, no pants and his whole right side of his leg was bleeding,\" Ben said. \"It's definitely super scary. I'm there twice a week getting my groceries, and I was actually about to go there until I saw all the cops outside.\"Correction: A previous version misstated which person Steven McHugh said overheard the shots on the phone.

        "content": "(CNN)Delaina Yaun and her husband were at Youngs Asian Massage, a spa in Acworth, Georgia, last Tuesday, when a gunman entered and opened fire.\"They just went to go have some time alone, husband and wife. Just time together,\" Dana Toole, Yaun's sister, told CNN. \"Unfortunately, it went bad. It went bad real fast.\" How to help Asian Americans under attackYaun was killed, one of the nine victims in shootings at three different spas in the Atlanta-area -- one in Acworth and two in Atlanta. Of the eight people who lost their lives, six were Asian women.Four people were killed at the spa in Cherokee County, about 30 miles northwest of Atlanta. They were identified by authorities as 33-year-old Yaun, of Acworth; Paul Andre Michels, 54, of Atlanta; Xiaojie Tan, 49, of Kennesaw; and Daoyou Feng, 44. One man, Elcias Hernandez-Ortiz, survived. Four people were also killed at the spas in Atlanta. On Friday, the Fulton County Medical Examiner identified the victims as Soon Chung Park, 74; Hyun Jung Grant, 51; Suncha Kim, 69; and Yong Ae Yue, 63. Read MoreAmong them were mothers, a business owner and an avid cook. This is what we know so far about the victims.Xiaojie TanXiaojie Tan, the owner of Youngs Asian Massage, was a loving, unselfish person who made others feel like family, Greg Hynson, a friend of Tan's, told CNN. \"Hey, we're family,\" he said they would tell each other often. \"I'll watch your back, you watch mine.\" On his last birthday, Tan sent Hynson a text: \"Hey, what are you doing?\"Xiaojie TanShe invited him over to the business, where flowers and a cake with his name on it were waiting, he said, giving an example of her thoughtfulness.The two met through mutual friends more than five years ago.  Tan was a diligent, hardworking businesswoman, Hynson said, and her employees \"were always sweet and nice people,\" he said. \"Very similar to her personality.\"Hynson would often stop by her Cherokee County business to say hello, just like he did the weekend before the shootings, he said. That was the last time he saw Tan, who was busy at the time.  \"I'll come back later,\" he remembered telling her when he saw her.  \"I didn't get a chance to come back later,\" he said.  My parents came to the US from Korea for a better future. We must stop the hateTan's former husband, Michael Webb, told CNN she was a hardworking woman who had always been determined to own her own business. She became a nail technician while they lived in Florida, he said, working every day and saving her money. They later moved to Georgia, where she ran a business in Marietta for 10 years before she opened Youngs Asian Massage. \"Over the last couple years she'd kept saying to me, 'I'm going to be able to retire soon,'\" Webb said.\"She worked so hard,\" he said. \"I'm sad that it ended in an instant while she was working hard, and she'll never get to enjoy that.\"Webb told CNN that Tan was protective of her employees, sometimes kicking certain men out of the spa.\"She wanted to know where her employees were ... who the customers were, she used to tell me a lot of times she would throw customers out because they would come in and think that they could have sex,\" Webb said.Delaina YaunYaun's sister described her as a family-oriented person. Recently married, she was the mother of two children, including an 8-month-old daughter. Delaina Yaun\"Her family came first. Everything was her family,\" Toole said. \"She had such a wonderful, happy, upbeat personality.\" \"She was a good person,\" Toole said. \"She didn't deserve that. Nobody deserved it.\" Yaun's husband made it out of the Acworth spa safely, according to a GoFundMe page that said her family was heartbroken and \"there's nothing anyone could do to help with the pain.\"Officers handcuffed the husband of one of the spa shooting victims for hours after the attacksIn an interview with Mundo Hispanico, Yaun's husband, Mario Gonzalez, said he was in a different room at the time the shooting started, about an hour into the massages. \"They took the most valuable thing I have in my life,\" he said, adding, \"He left me with only pain, the killer who killed my wife.\"Another GoFundMe page called Yaun a \"beautiful Angel.\" \"She has two beautiful babies she is leaving behind,\" it said. \"We just don't know how to do any of this alone.\"Hyun Jung GrantAsian Americans demand change after shootings: ''I want people to finally hear us ... not only when we're trending'Hyun Jung Grant was among those killed at Gold Massage Spa in Atlanta, her son, Randy Park, said on a GoFundMe page that had raised more than $2.7 million by Sunday evening. Park described her as a \"single mother who dedicated her whole life to providing for my brother and I.\" \"She was one of my best friends and the strongest influence on who we are today,\" he said. \"Losing her has put a new lens on my eyes on the amount of hate that exists in our world.\" Park said he and his brother are the only members of his family in the United States. The rest of their family is in South Korea.Yong Ae YueA statement from Yong Ae Yue's sons released by a family attorney said they are \"devastated by the loss of our beloved mother, and words cannot adequately describe our grief.\"Yong Ae Yue\"Mom was an amazing woman who loved to introduce our family and friends to her home-cooked Korean food and Korean karaoke,\" Yue's youngest son wrote on GoFundMe, adding they would \"miss joining mom on her weekly Sunday routine to the grocery store and traditional Korean dinner.\"\"She was always kind-hearted and willing to help everyone she encountered,\" he said.Elcias Hernandez-OrtizElcias Hernandez-Ortiz was shot at Youngs Asian Massage in Acworth -- the sole survivor of last Tuesday's shootings.Hernandez-Ortiz suffered injuries including being shot in the forehead and will need facial surgery, his wife, Flora Gonzalez Gomez, said on GoFundMe. He is now in the intensive care unit in the hospital, she said.In an interview with CNN en Espa\u00f1ol on Thursday, Gonzalez Gomez said she received a call from her husband, a mechanic, moments after the shooting. \"He called me and told me, 'I got shot, I got shot, please come,'\" she said. \"That was the only thing he told me. It was terrifying listening to that.\" Elcias Hernandez OrtizHis daughter, 9-year-old Yoseline Gonzalez, watched medics load him into an ambulance after the shooting. \"I don't really know what to do. I try to calm myself down,\" Yoseline told CNN affiliate WGCL, wiping away her tears.According to Yoseline, doctors told his family he was very lucky to have survived. \"He is a really good dad,\" she said. \"I don't want him to go.\"Gonzalez Gomez called it a \"miracle\" that he is alive. \"And for that I'm very thankful to God,\" she said, \"because I know he'll move past this.\"Suncha KimOne of Suncha Kim's grandchildren wrote about her on a GoFundMe page, saying she emigrated from Seoul to provide a better life for her family.Admiring her courage for making the move to the US, the family said Kim spoke very little English upon arrival and worked two to three jobs. She leaves behind a husband, two children and three grandchildren.\"As an immigrant, all my grandmother ever wanted in life was to grow old with my grandfather, and watch her children and grandchildren live the life she never got to live,\" the post says.\"Outside of our immediate family, everyone that met my grandmother loved her dearly. She was pure hearted and the most selfless woman I knew. She represented everything I wanted to be as a woman, without an ounce of hate or bitterness in her heart.\"An update from the family Friday said, \"It brings tears to our eyes that you are all standing with us and our beloved halmoni, mother, and wife. Suncha was such a strong, loving presence in all of our lives and we miss her so much.\"Fear among Asian American communityFour of the victims were of Korean ethnicity, South Korea's foreign ministry said Wednesday.  \"Our government is closely watching the situation, holding a deep interest in the safety of our compatriots overseas,\" South Korean Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong said at a news conference. \"We express our deep condolences to the American citizens too.\"This group is giving personal alarms to Asian Americans to protect them from violenceActivist groups, community members and officials said the attacks heightened existing fear among Asians in the US in the wake of increasing incidents of hate resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic.\"It's difficult to ignore the fact that many of the victims were Asian, all of the victims in Atlanta were Asian, in fact, and that he targeted these Asian massage parlors,\" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told CNN on Wednesday.\"Regardless of the motivation, given the concerns the community already has in light of all the attacks that we've seen -- particularly against Asian American women and the elderly -- I think this is a reminder that we need to do everything that we possibly can to protect the most vulnerable among us,\" Georgia state Rep. Sam Park told CNN.The organizations Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, Asian American Advocacy Fund, 9to5 and Korean American Coalition Metro Atlanta said they are gathering resources and funds for those impacted and the families of the Asian victims.

        "content": "(CNN)A month before Election Day in Florida a mysterious company called Proclivity, Inc. contributed $550,000 to a pair of newly formed political action committees in the state.Two days later, the money flowed from the PACs to an Orlando-area print and advertising firm.Shortly thereafter, came a torrent of nearly identical political fliers seemingly intended to siphon away support from Democratic candidates by tricking voters into casting their ballots for purported spoiler candidates who demonstrated no real interest in getting elected. None, for example, engaged in typical campaigning activities or raised significant funds. In one case, the mailers appear to have helped a Republican\u2014a co-founder of Latinas For Trump\u2014unseat the Democratic incumbent in a state Senate race by a razor-thin margin of just 32 votes.The situation, which has been generating headlines in Florida for weeks, has all the makings of a \"dark money\" mystery in the Sunshine State.Read MoreAmong the key questions: What exactly is Proclivity and what was the purpose and desired effect behind its generous contributions to the two fledging PACs? And, why did those PACs support unknown candidates with no party affiliations and no real chance of winning?CNN has learned that Proclivity was created in Delaware in 2019. Its president is listed in its corporate filings as Richard Alexander. Attempts to reach Alexander were unsuccessful; a phone number for the company is no longer working and its listed address is a UPS store in Atlanta. Staff at the store confirmed that Proclivity had a mailbox, but declined to provide any additional information, citing client confidentiality.Though Proclivity's money paid for advertising ostensibly targeting Democratic voters, it flowed through a pair of PACs, one of which has connections to a young Republican political strategist named Alex Alvarado. Alvarado's stepfather is president of the company paid to print the fliers. The company is run out of an Orlando-area home that Alvarado's stepfather and mother own, records show. Republican political strategist Alex Alvarado, a former congressional intern, pictured outside the White House.Alvarado, a former congressional intern and entrepreneur, declined to be interviewed for this story. Records show that his firm, Alvarado Strategies, was paid more than $267,000 so far this year for its political work. The two Florida PACs that received the Proclivity contributions were both registered on the same date and time --- October 2 at 11:34 am, according to Florida Division of Elections documents.One day later, one of the PACs -- Our Florida PC -- got $370,000 from Proclivity; the other -- The Truth PC -- got $180,000. The PACS are each chaired by women in their mid-20s who appear to be newcomers to the political scene. Neither woman responded to multiple messages left for them at the phone numbers listed for the PACs. Attempts to reach them through various other means were unsuccessful.Sierra Olive, who is listed as chair of Our Florida PC, once shared an address with Emily Leiva, the woman with whom Alvarado currently owns a house, according to records. Olive posted a photo of herself and Leiva to Facebook in 2017 with the caption \"favorite human.\" Sierra Olive and Emily Leiva in a photo posted on Facebook in 2017. \"Favorite Human,\" the caption reads.Leiva did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Some of the fliers paid for by Our Florida PC and The Truth PC contained identical language referencing typically Democratic themes such as fixing health care, fighting climate change and speaking truth to power. They were circulated in at least three state Senate races in which a non-party affiliated candidate was running in addition to a Democrat and Republican.In the South Florida race featuring the Latinas for Trump candidate, the purported spoiler candidate had the same last name -- Rodriguez -- as Democratic incumbent Jose Javier Rodriguez.Candidates for a state senate seat race in South Florida in which a spoiler appeared to help Republican challenger Ileana Garcia unseat incumbent Democrat Jose Javier Rodriguez.Though he has no known history in politics and did not actively campaign, Alex Rodriguez garnered more than 6,000 votes. When questioned by a Miami TV reporter after the election, Rodriguez lied about his own identity, according to WPLG, a CNN affiliate in South Florida. Rodriguez was charged with two counts of felony grand theft in 2012, according to court records. He pleaded guilty, though adjudication of the charges was withheld, the documents show.In another case, Miami attorney Juan A. Sanchez said Rodriguez went missing after paying only a portion of what a judge ordered him to pay to a client in a dispute involving a worthless check.\"We couldn't track him down,\" said Sanchez, who said Rodriguez was eventually found living in Boca Raton, Florida. \"He gave a sob story that he was broke and had no money.\"The attorney said he struggles to believe that Rodriguez seriously sought to become a state senator. \"That would be something incredible,\" he said.Candidate Alex Rodriguez lied about his identity when questioned by a Miami TV reporter, according to WPLG, a CNN affiliate in South Florida.Alex Rodriguez did not respond to CNN's request for comment. His attorney, William Barzee, declined to comment.   Jose Javier Rodriguez, the incumbent state senator who lost by 32 votes, has called for a probe into Alex Rodriguez's candidacy and who is behind it.\"Democracy requires transparency,\" he said in a video shared with the media, \"and in order to achieve that I believe this election warrants a full investigation.\" Ileana Garcia, the newly elected Republican state senator, side stepped questions from CNN about her involvement -- if any -- in the other Rodriguez's campaign. \"I will not allow this temper tantrum to distract from the important work ahead,\" Garcia said, in part, in a statement.Erin Isaac, who serves as a spokesperson for both Garcia and Florida's Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, said the committee had no connection to Alex Rodriguez's candidacy.\"Did we have anything to do with it? My answer is no,\" she said.Ileana Garcia, co-founder of Latinas For Trump, unseated the incumbent Democrat by a margin of just 32 votes in a state senate race in South Florida.The Miami Herald, citing \"sources with knowledge,\" reported last week that Miami-Dade prosecutors have launched an inquiry into Alex Rodriguez's candidacy. A spokesperson for the office declined to confirm or deny the existence of an investigation to CNN.Ben Wilcox, research director of the nonpartisan watchdog group Integrity Florida, said he has no doubt that someone running a dark money campaign impacted at least one state senate seat.\"Florida is so loosely regulated when it comes to financing of campaigns that it's probably legal, but it really shouldn't be,\" Wilcox said. \"It's a disservice to voters and it calls into question the integrity of our elections.\"CNN's Amitoj Singh, Yahya Abou-Ghazala, Cybele Mayes-Osterman and Benjamin Naughton contributed to this report.",

To support the applications, the indictment says Pan made untrue statement about the companies' employees and expenses -- complete with fake documents and falsified tax filings.The final amount Pan sought was just over $6.1 million, and he received more than $1.7 million in benefits, according to the indictment.Read MorePan did not respond to CNN's request for comment, and CNN could not determine whether he has legal representation at this time.PPP loans are meant for small business and other organizations for payroll costs, mortgages, rent and utilities. They were part of the CARES act, enacted March 29, which aimed to provide emergency financial assistance to Americans during the Covid-19 pandemic. Yet more than 50 people have been charged for allegedly committing fraud to get money from PPP, Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian Rabbitt said last month. \"Unfortunately, the rapid injection of trillions of dollars in PPP loans into the economy has created a very high risk for fraud at a time when many organizations and their employees are already operating under the kind of intense financial pressure that often leads to fraud and embezzlement,\" John Warren, general counsel for the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE), previously told CNN.Seventy-six perfect of certified fraud examiners expect a rise in loan fraud over the next year, according to an ACFE survey.CNN's Matt Egan contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)The billboards began popping up along a desert stretch of highway in Arizona and California in early August \u2014 plastered with \"Make America Great Again!\" in large capital letters or an image of President Donald Trump looking up to the sky and giving a big thumbs up. The small company that funded the large billboards had just months earlier received a large cash infusion backed by the same administration now being celebrated, public records show.Jones 1 Inc. was approved for a loan of between $150,000 and $350,000 at the end of April through the federal government's Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which was set up to help struggling small businesses save jobs during the pandemic.  The company, which owns a small Shell gas station and travel center in Needles, California, went on to lease \"six beautiful Trump billboards\" near the border of California and Arizona, which a local group of Lake Havasu Republicans heralded \u2014 thanking \"a generous Trump supporter.\" The company that paid for the billboards, Jones 1 Inc., owns a Shell gas station in Needles, California and received a loan of between $150,000 and $350,000 through the federal government's Paycheck Protection Program.Six political billboards could cost anywhere from around $10,000 for four weeks to nearly $30,000 depending on the location, according to average price estimates provided by Lamar Advertising, which leased the space to Jones 1 Inc. It declined to provide the pricing of the specific billboards. But if they stay up through the election, which the local Republican group that inspired the billboards said is the plan, the costs could range from around $30,000 to around $120,000. Read More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse CNN's database of Paycheck Protection Program loans to see where billions in pandemic relief loans went.\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\nJoseph Jones, the owner of the business, told CNN the PPP money was used for payroll, not for the billboards. His loan application reported that the business employed 32 workers, according to data from the Small Business Administration. Jones declined to provide the total cost of the billboards but said he did not spend anywhere near $120,000. \"I simply wanted to support my president, that's all there is to it.\" Whether or not the money Jones 1 Inc. received through the Small Business Administration loan program was directly used to pay for the Trump billboards, business ethics professors and legal experts said non-essential spending like this violates the spirit of the program, which was meant for small businesses that desperately needed the assistance to keep paying workers. More importantly, they said, this spending highlights failures in how the program was implemented and the confusion surrounding which businesses should have been entitled to the money. It also underscores the need for increased oversight \u2014 especially when the government decides which loans to forgive outright.  \"If you have enough capital to spend it on billboards, maybe you shouldn't have been one of the companies to receive this loan,\" said Liz Hempowicz, director of public policy at the Project On Government Oversight (POGO), a nonprofit watchdog group. \"The responsibility really rested with the SBA and the administration to make sure they were spending these taxpayer dollars in a way that Congress intended.\" Linda Ferrell, a business ethics professor at Auburn University, said companies receiving taxpayer-subsidized funds should have a \"social responsibility\" to use the money to protect their employees and customers. But like Hempowicz, she said she holds the government more responsible than any one business owner, especially given the uncertainty at the beginning of the pandemic that may have led some business owners to apply for the loans in good faith, before ending up in better financial shape than expected.Different versions of the billboards funded by Jones 1 Inc. appear off of Arizona State Route 95 and Interstate 40.Gianna Kraft, creator of the Lake Havasu Republicans Facebook group, said that her members came up with the idea for the billboards, and Jones was the one who stepped up to make it happen. \"I'm getting daily pictures, people taking selfies showing their support, people driving by and saying they're awesome and what a great impact they are having,\" she said. \"Where are the Biden billboards?\" Kraft said, saying these recently installed Trump advertisements are indicative of how much stronger the enthusiasm is for the President than for his opponent, especially in the Lake Havasu area, which will be hosting a boat parade in Trump's honor over Labor Day weekend.  She said she had no knowledge of whether Jones used PPP money to fund the billboards or how much they cost. \"I am not familiar with anyone's financial affairs.\" The PPP program was the subject of significant controversy in its initial stages after revelations that large publicly-traded companies like Shake Shack and the operator of Ruth's Chris Steakhouse had received millions of dollars in PPP loans \u2014 which they ended up returning. The SBA and Treasury Department issued guidance around the same time reiterating that all borrowers needed to self-certify \"in good faith\" that the loan was necessary for them to stay in operation. For many small businesses, federal loan money has already run outBased on the rules from the SBA, businesses that falsely certified the loan was necessary to remain in operation and failed to return the funds can face civil and criminal penalties.PPP funds were lent at an interest rate of 1%, which is far lower than traditional private sector business loans, and will be forgiven entirely if businesses demonstrate they used the money for \"payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities\" and \"at least 60% of the forgiven amount must have been used for payroll,\" according to the SBA website.\"I don't know if it matters if it was the PPP loan money or other money that was freed up by the PPP loan,\" POGO's Hempowicz said about the funds used to pay for the billboards. Even if Jones 1 Inc. doesn't apply for forgiveness, she said the business is \"still benefiting from a hilariously low interest rate that wasn't necessarily designed to allow small business owners to buy a bunch of billboards.\"\n\n\n\nWhat should we investigate next?\n\nEmail Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken\n\n\nJones would not provide additional information about the circumstances that led him to apply for the loan. He also declined to say whether his company's financial situation had improved since applying for the loan, or comment on whether he has plans to return the money or apply for the loan to be forgiven. To date, more than $525 billion in loans was approved through the federal lending program established by Congress during the early days of the pandemic. But many small businesses affected by mandatory Covid-19 shutdowns complained early on about not being able to secure a loan. The owner of the business that funded the billboards told CNN the PPP money was used for payroll, not for the signs.The local bank that provided Jones with the SBA-backed loan declined to comment on client information. The SBA also said it couldn't comment on specific borrowers when asked by CNN whether businesses able to afford large non-business expenditures, such as the billboard purchases, should have been eligible for a PPP loan.The agency has said more generally that a bank's approval of a PPP loan does not mean the SBA has determined that company is eligible for the loan and that while only those loans of more than $2 million will be automatically reviewed, all PPP loans are subject to SBA review at any time.It is common for businesses, both public and private, to get involved with politics \u2014 often donating money to political groups known as Super PACs that advocate for specific candidates. There is no limit on independent spending that is not conducted in coordination with political campaigns. But there are disclosure rules for these kinds of \"independent expenditures,\" and spending of more than $1,000 must be reported to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) within 24 hours. While the billboards state they were paid for by Jones 1 Inc., they do not include the required disclaimer that they were not authorized by a political candidate. FEC records also show Jones 1 Inc. has not reported the spending, and Jones did not comment on this. Man spent PPP funds on hotels, jewelry and $318,497 Lamborghini, authorities say The FEC did not comment directly on Jones 1 Inc.'s political billboard spending but confirmed to CNN that it had not been reported.   Businesses that primarily engage in political activities are not allowed to receive SBA business loans under federal law, but this regulation would not apply to a small business like a gas station that is also engaging in political spending. At first, the Trump administration fought to keep information about who had benefited from the massive government assistance program secret, but limited data was released in July after lawmakers put pressure on the agency and media organizations, including CNN, sued in federal court over the disclosure. Michael Santoro, a professor of business ethics at Santa Clara University, said there is an inherent conflict of interest because the recipient of a PPP loan in this case is advocating for the reelection of the same administration that oversaw the disbursement of the money.He said the real question is whether the SBA will investigate this and take action if it identifies improper spending. \"Clearly something looks really, really wrong,\" he said, \"so that's the SBA's job to look into.\"Do you have anything to share about Covid-19 in nursing homes?

        "content": "(CNN)The founder of a popular neo-Nazi website who encouraged his readers to launch an avalanche of hate toward a Jewish woman says the victim could simply have ignored the phone calls, texts and social media messages.Andrew Anglin made the arguments in court documents submitted by his lawyers in response to a lawsuit that seeks to hold him liable after using his website to encourage his thousands of readers to contact Tanya Gersh. Most of the messages contained hate-filled language and centered on the fact that Gersh is Jewish. Anglin wrote that it shouldn't matter what Gersh thought of the words sent to her after his article in the Daily Stormer, as, he claims, it was all free speech protected by the First Amendment.    Gersh, with the help of the Southern Poverty Law Center, is suing Anglin for \"invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress and violations of Montana's Anti-Intimidation Act.\" That suit was filed in April in the US District Court for Montana. Anglin and his legal team are asking for the lawsuit to be dismissed, largely because of the First Amendment.\"[Gersh] clearly would prefer not to hear the words of Mr. Anglin and his alleged readers, but liberty demands that they remain free to speak them,\" according to Anglin's latest legal argument filed with the court. Read MoreGersh said she received a voice mail with the sound of gunshots. There were letters sent to the home she shared with her husband and young son, who also received messages on social media. Gersh earlier this year told CNN she was haunted and threatened by the images, and feared for her and her family's life so much that they debated fleeing the state because the threats felt so real. \"The response may have been voluminous and crude, but defendant is not liable for the speech of his readers,\" Anglin's motion reads. Tanya Gersh says harassing messages reached her in every corner of her life. It started with a small-town dispute The troll storm began after a dispute between Gersh and fellow Whitefish, Montana, resident Sherry Spencer. Spencer is the mother of white nationalist Richard Spencer.Gersh became a target for hate after contacting tenants of a building owned by Sherry Spencer, warning them about possible protests over her son's views.This mixed-use property was at the center of a dispute between Sherry Spencer and Tanya Gersh. When Sherry Spencer called to ask her advice, Gersh said, she advised her to sell the building and donate money to a human rights group as a way to defuse tensions. Gersh said she offered to help Spencer sell the property. Sherry Spencer eventually accused Gersh in a public blog post of threatening her livelihood. She wrote that Gersh told her protesters and media would turn up and drive down the building's value if she didn't sell.  An avalanche of hate: How a Montana mom became the target of a neo-Nazi troll stormThat is where Anglin came in. He began writing about the case on the Daily Stormer, calling what Gersh did \"extortion.\" He encouraged his troll army to tell Gersh what they thought of her and on his website he posted her personal information and ways to reach her. His supporters did so by the hundreds. One way Anglin defends himself is to say Gersh could have simply not checked her phone to avoid messages or social media. \"Social media, email, and telephone messages are not directed to a home \u2014 they are directed to distant cloud computer  servers  to  which  the  individual  must  affirmatively  reach  out  to  acquire.  Unlike mail, delivered by the government daily to the home, plaintiff need not reach out and check her electronic and telephonic messages, from home or elsewhere,\" the response reads. Another angle of the defense is to deny the Holocaust -- a baseless claim that often appears on the Daily Stormer to infuriate Jews and rally Anglin's supporters.  In his legal response, Anglin demands the court take his mindset into consideration when looking at the intent of the imagery created of Gersh, and those sent to her.  Some of those images included pictures of Gersh and her son's faces manipulated to appear to be on the gates of a Nazi concentration camp.  \"In defendant's mindset, there are no gas chambers; there are no ovens; there are no mass killings of Jews,\" Anglin and his lawyers argue in the court document. \"To the speaker, these are fictional metaphors, a 'threat'  as true as a 'Star Wars' fanatic sending Death Star-blowing-up -- Vulcan imagery to a 'Star Trek' fan. It may be hateful, but it is no true threat.\" In response to Anglin's brief,  Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt called Anglin's mindset \"one of Holocaust denial and pernicious anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.\" Greenblatt argued that defense shouldn't be allowed.\"Under the law, Anglin should not be able to hide behind coded language and keyboards, tearing a person's life apart because of their race or religion and then be able to claim that his speech was protected because of his own mindset.\"CNN asked Anglin's attorney Marc Randazza about the claim of the Holocaust denial as a defense.\"It doesn't matter that this guy denies the Holocaust happened, it doesn't matter that he's a bigot. In fact, it matters more,\" Randazza said. \"There is no greater way than to preach your love for the First Amendment then to take on a case from someone whose speech you abhor.\" Anglin: Messages more insults than violent threats  Anglin says other statements made toward Gersh are not threats that imply violence. He explains that one comment, telling Gersh a \"goylash\" was coming, is merely self-referential. The term goy means a non-Jew, and the phrase goylash is often used by the alt-right when calling for a backlash by non-Jews against Jews. He says that statements that people were going to find Gersh or ruin her did not imply violence. They simply stated that people could find her through public means, and threats could be financial. \"There is nothing violent about looking to see what a person does in public, and it was only publicly available information that had been presented about plaintiff,\" Anglin argues. Anglin also defends himself against a charge of intimidation under the Montana Anti-Intimidation Act by claiming the law itself is over broad. But even if it weren't, \"Nothing in the alleged threats cited ... suggests anything other than hyperbolic insult.\"  Greenblat, the Anti-Defamation League CEO, said he sees it differently.\"Anglin has the First Amendment right to post a wide range of hateful and false ramblings online, but we all have a right to be free from what any reasonable person would understand to be a true threat,\" Greenblatt told CNN. \"It is crucial that the courts keep up with the technology and the state of hate today.\"Anglin also argues the court has no jurisdiction in this case, because he was not living in the United States during the time of the alleged threats. Anglin submitted voter registration records in which he asks that mail be forwarded to Krasnodar Krai, in Southern Russia. Anglin checked a box that said he did not know when he was going to return. He maintains in court documents he continues to live abroad, and therefore, the lawsuit should be thrown out.Neo-Nazi site founder says 'troll storm' is protected speech, wants lawsuit dismissedIn the legal document, Anglin and his team wrote: \"Like Samuel Adams, Mr. Anglin behooved his readers to adhere to the law and keep within its bounds.\" In the request for dismissal, Anglin calls the lawsuit \"an affront to the First Amendment.\" The SPLC said its attorneys are reviewing the motion.CNN's Sara Sidner contributed to this report.",

I didn't know who these people were. I didn't know where they were. I didn't know if they were coming to find me,\" Dumpson told CNN in an exclusive television interview.And finally, she decided to fight back.Not with threats of her own or joining in the vitriol, but suing for justice. Her quest to challenge the anonymous trolls led to something no one predicted: A personal apology.Read MoreTaylor Dumpson says she is still on edge, more than two years after being the target of online trolls.\"People think about protests and advocacy or lobbying or different things,\" Dumpson said of ways to fight the hate. \"But litigation can also be a tool for social change,\" she said. Neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin had encouraged trolls to target Dumpson after her historic win in May 2017 as the first African-American female student body president at American University in Washington. She was black, she was a woman and she was excelling at university -- all things that white supremacists hate.Anglin did not respond to the lawsuit against him and his highly trafficked neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website, even when a $725,000 judgment was entered against him, the site and another troll --  money that Dumpson may never see. And no one was ever identified as the hanger of the lynched bananas around the AU campus, a clear hark back to America's murderous racist past and an intimidation tactic. I have real feelings.

His attacks were far from the worst Dumpson received, but he was the only one who would take responsibility.White supremacists increase recruiting efforts at colleges, ADL says Dumpson wanted someone, a real person not hiding behind an avatar or sneaking around campus, to be held accountable for the very real terror she had endured from anonymous haters. She was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder because of the torrent of abuse she endured. She wanted some semblance of closure.But she also believes in restorative justice.

She would not reveal the words they exchanged when they finally sat down face to face.She would barely talk about how it felt.\"It was a trying moment,\" she said. But it was worth it.\"That's why I was able to look him in his eye and it's because I have a true belief that people can change.\" Dumpson said. \"I've had to remind myself, I have to believe that because if I didn't, then that would be them winning.\"Neither Anglin nor the man who apologized to Dumpson responded to CNN requests for comment.Internet sites blamed for helping incite racist violence, but there's no plan to rein them inDumpson left Washington after graduation and earned a place at law school in a different city. She hopes her tormentor and others like him stop their harassment for good. \"Even though you're a white supremacist, even though you're a neo-Nazi, even though you think like this, I don't think you're always going to think like that,\" she said. \"I don't think that it has to be that way.\"Litigation was my clap back.Taylor DumpsonHer case could set a precedent. She won the argument that -- just like physical harassment -- online harassment can also interfere with civil rights such as the right to get an education.\"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first court decision in the country that has held that online harassment can interfere with public accommodations,\" said David Brody, an attorney with the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law that supported Dumpson's case.\"Civil rights laws do not stop where the cloud begins.\"More than two years after it began, the hate still follows Dumpson, and she's still on edge, she said.Neo-Nazi website founder ordered to pay $14M for troll stormAnd there are parts of her life she has lost forever, like how she had planned to start her leadership of the American University students.\"I didn't get a chance to send an email to the student body about, 'Hi, welcome.

        "content": "(CNN)Less than a month before he died of Covid-19, Victor Sison posted photos of himself at the New Jersey nursing home where he had worked for many years. He was wrapped in what appeared to be garbage bags. \"LORD HELP ALL MY FELLOW FRONTLINERS,\" he wrote in early April.Sison, who loved caring for the elderly and went out of his way to spend time with residents who didn't get visitors, had complained to his family about a lack of basic protective gear such as gowns and masks. As the coronavirus crisis worsened, Sison volunteered to come in on his days off to fill in for others who had called out sick. But shortly after posting the photo of himself in plastic, Sison, too, became ill. The 64-year-old died on April 18, just a year before he planned to retire. His family wasn't allowed to visit him in the hospital due to Covid-19, so they said their goodbyes over FaceTime as a hospital worker held the phone over Sison's bed. Read MoreVictor Sison posted photos of himself on Facebook shortly before he passed away of coronavirus.Sison's son, Paulo, said he appreciates that nursing home operators want to help the elderly, but worried \"they sometimes forget about their workers.\" To date, the state health department has reported that 65 employees have contracted the virus at the facility where Sison worked, Complete Care at Hamilton Plaza. Three have died. But when Sison passed away, his death went unnoticed by the one federal agency responsible for protecting workers during the pandemic: the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). OSHA did not send inspectors to the facility to find out what happened to Sison or his two colleagues, or to determine whether working conditions at the 120-bed nursing home were safe, according to agency data. Following inquiries from CNN about Sison, however, OSHA said this week it has launched an investigation into a death at the facility \"to determine the proper course of action.\"Nursing home resident: 'I feel as though I am in #DeathCamp2020'Nursing homes are some of the highest risk environments for contracting Covid-19, and former OSHA officials say the agency is ill-equipped and unprepared to ensure that workers are protected. While these critics say that the agency should require health care employers to report every worker death from Covid-19, OSHA issued guidance in May that gives employers permission to not report deaths to the agency if a \"reasonable and good faith inquiry ... cannot determine whether it is more likely than not\" that an employee's Covid-19 infection was linked to exposure at work.The regional operator of the facility where Sison worked confirmed that he had died of Covid-19 and \"was a valued and beloved staff member who is greatly missed,\" but it said the facility never experienced a shortage of PPE. It said Sison's death \"was not reported to OSHA at that time, in accordance with OSHA's own guidelines\" and that \"due to the lack of contact tracing in April, we have no other definitive information.\" Many other deaths are going unreported as well, with nursing home operators claiming they can't determine whether someone became ill at work or contracted the disease elsewhere -- despite major outbreaks among both residents and employees at their facilities. That means OSHA -- as well as state worker safety programs approved by the agency -- has only physically investigated a fraction of nursing home employee deaths. Even when deaths or imminent dangers are reported to OSHA, and federal or state regulators launch an investigation, the agency has taken few actions to improve working conditions for other employees or hold employers accountable -- leaving countless workers around the country exposed to unsafe working conditions, according to a CNN analysis of OSHA inspection data, worker safety complaints and interviews with former government officials, workers and their families.\n\n\n\nWhat should we investigate next?\n\nEmail Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken\n\n\n\"As far as I can tell, they are sleeping,\" said David Michaels, the former head of OSHA during the Obama administration, specifically about the agency's top leadership. Now a professor at George Washington University School of Public Health, Michaels said that the government should be sending a message to the long-term care industry at large by penalizing employers who are putting their workers in danger.There is no reliable national data on the number of worker deaths at nursing homes related to Covid-19, but at least one government estimate puts the figure at more than 600 workers at around 400 facilities. As of mid-June, only 88 government inspections had been triggered by worker deaths or hospitalizations at nursing facilities. OSHA said it had received reports of 99 fatalities within the industry that were related to Covid-19, meaning regulators had investigated most of the deaths that were actually reported. Since then, another 48 \"fatality/catastrophe\" inspections at nursing homes have been logged, according to recent data. Safety regulators have conducted these kinds of inspections at around a dozen additional long-term care facilities identified by CNN, such as assisted living centers or veterans homes since the beginning of the pandemic. Nurse Mavis Charles-France passed away from coronavirus after her colleague complained to OSHA that the veterans home where they worked wasn't prepared for the pandemic. New Jersey, where Sison worked, is one state where it would presumably be easy for the agency to identify the facilities where worker deaths have occurred because the state's health department publicly releases that information online. According to the state, nearly 120 employees have died of coronavirus at more than 90 long-term care facilities in New Jersey, nearly all of which have battled large outbreaks. Yet OSHA data shows that inspections related to Covid-19 deaths or hospitalizations have only been opened at around 25 facilities in the state.  Had OSHA officials looked at the state's data on nursing home deaths, they would have seen that a single nursing home chain there, Alaris Health, had reported more than 500 employee cases of Covid-19 among its 16 facilities. Seven workers have died. But none of the Alaris facilities have been visited by OSHA inspectors, according to the agency's records. Two employees sued one of these locations in April for allegedly hiding coronavirus infections from employees, refusing to test patients and pressuring staff to come to work with symptoms of the disease.A spokesman for Alaris, which has denied the claims in court, said \"each and every allegation in this case is false,\" adding that employees were never pressured to work while sick and that information was never withheld from staff or residents. He would not say whether Alaris had reported worker deaths to OSHA, saying only that the company \"has and will continue to comply with all state and federal reporting guidelines.\" Covid-19 is ravaging nursing homes. Government records show whyIn a statement to CNN about its oversight of the nursing home industry during the pandemic, OSHA said the agency has the tools it needs to police workplaces through existing regulations and has been providing \"robust guidance for employers and employees.\" The agency declined to comment on ongoing investigations, which can take up to six months to conclude. \"OSHA is swiftly and diligently working to keep America's workforce safe and healthy during the coronavirus pandemic,\" the agency said in a statement. Former OSHA officials, however, say the agency should be doing far more to protect workers during these unprecedented times. They said OSHA lacks the resources to respond to the overwhelming number of complaints and deaths -- with staffing of inspectors at the lowest level in 45 years. And the guidance issued to employers about reporting deaths was murky, they said, leaving an opening for deaths to go unreported and uninvestigated. The American Health Care Association, a trade organization representing long-term care facilities, said that the long incubation of the virus makes it difficult to determine whether fatalities are \"work related\" and therefore required to be reported to OSHA. While the organization said cases among health care workers could be attributable to community spread, it said facilities may want to \"err on the side of over reporting to OSHA.\" Government employees: What public records should we request as we report on the coronavirus?But that does not appear to be happening.Supervisors at an Illinois nursing home, for example, did not immediately report an employee death because they were trying to determine where the virus was contracted, a spokesman for the corporate owner said in June. Even though he acknowledged the facility had an outbreak, with state data showing a total of 59 Covid-19 cases and 11 deaths, the spokesman said at the time it was \"unclear whether this staff member was infected at the facility.\" After the CNN inquiry, the facility did report the death to OSHA. A Connecticut nursing home, meanwhile, told CNN it did not report a nurse's April death to the agency despite eventually learning of a positive Covid-19 test. Even the deaths that do result in inspections may not involve agency officials actually visiting the facilities in-person. OSHA said some can take place remotely when resources are stretched thin.Until this week, the federal agency had only cited one nursing home for a violation related to Covid-19 -- levying a roughly $6,500 penalty on a Georgia facility accused of failing to report worker hospitalizations in a timely manner, which critics said would do little to discourage bad behavior or serve as a warning to other facilities. On Tuesday, the agency issued a press release saying it had cited the operator of three Ohio nursing homes for failing to ensure proper PPE usage, proposing penalties of more than $40,000.Geddes Scott worries OSHA isn't listening to health care workers who believe their lives are in danger. In some cases, the agency had been put on notice that work conditions were potentially dangerous. A review of some 700 closed complaints filed by long-term care employees show they have continued to report not being given adequate protective equipment, such as masks and gowns as recently as this month, and others have claimed they were forced to work while sick with coronavirus or were kept in the dark about outbreaks at their facilities. But the majority of their complaints have been closed after employers denied the claims or promised to address alleged issues. OSHA data also shows that several complaints came from staff working at facilities that later became sites of OSHA investigations into at least one employee death. That was the case at St. Albans Community Living Center, a New York veterans home where Mavis Charles-France had worked for 10 years before dying of coronavirus in May.Worried that the facility was not prepared for coronavirus to strike, Charles-France's coworker and fellow nurse Geddes Scott said he contacted OSHA in April, about a month before Charles-France's death. The federally run facility didn't have enough PPE or tests for employees, he said, and basic precautions to control the spread of the virus were not being taken by management. As Covid-19 cases began to emerge at the facility, he said workers, including Charles-France, were concerned about their safety. \"She told me she was scared,\" said Scott. \"She was crossing her fingers and hoping.\"Nursing home workers warned government about safety violations before Covid-19 outbreaks and deathsScott recalls being told by an OSHA representative that the only way regulators would enter the building to investigate a complaint like his would be if someone died. Agency data shows that a complaint made on April 9 about a lack of masks and gloves at the facility was closed.\"The agency wasn't listening to us,\" said Scott. \"The parachutes and help that are supposed to be there for employees, those are just fallacies.\" It was almost a month after Charles-France's death that Scott said he received a message from an investigator. When they got on the phone, he said, the inspector didn't ask many questions about the facility's handling of Covid-19 and \"seemed like they were clearing their desk,\" instead of trying to get to the bottom of why Charles-France died. Scott said he remains skeptical that the investigation will result in any substantial changes at St. Albans. A spokesman for the VA New York Harbor Healthcare System said it is \"mourning the recent loss of a longtime employee who passed away from COVID-19 complications,\" but disputed Scott's concerns, saying that the facility has always provided workers with adequate PPE and that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance was being followed to protect all employees, adding that \"complaints are not facts, they are merely allegations.\"Charles-France, who had studied to become a nurse after migrating to New York from Guyana in 1985, planned to retire next year, according to her sister Desiree Charles. She wanted to be closer to their mother and do more volunteering. Charles' most recent memory of her sister was how, after getting off her shift on a Friday night in late April, she drove three hours to help care for their 97-year-old mother. \"It was always her dream to be a nurse and to be helping people,\" she said.Winston France, Charles-France's husband, said they also had plans to travel in retirement. He became sick with the virus just days after his wife, and at one point they were in the same hospital room together. He remembered his wife being concerned about her safety at work and specifically complaining about people entering her office without proper PPE. \"A lot of people say why didn't she just take off?\" he said. \"She cared about her job so much ... Mavis wanted to be a nurse and she died. She died being a nurse.\"Do you have anything to share about Covid-19 in nursing homes? Is there something else you think we should investigate?

        "content": "(CNN)When news broke months ago about the country's first coronavirus outbreak at a nursing home, Linda Mayberry immediately recognized the home's corporate logo as it flashed across her television screen. It was the same one emblazoned throughout the long-term care facility where she lived. Her nursing home, she realized, was owned by the same company struggling to curtail a rising death toll in Kirkland, Washington. Mayberry began to dread what would happen if coronavirus swept through her building. Soon after this discovery, her facility in Bellflower, California, instituted a lockdown in March, barring all visitors to try to keep the disease out. Mayberry spent her days alone in her room. Before the pandemic, she passed the time watching hours of classic movies, but now, as the black and white films played in the background, she scoured the internet for news about what was happening in the outside world. Mayberry, a film buff, shared this photo watching TV from her bed in her California nursing home.At first, few local governments released information about how Covid-19 was ravaging the vulnerable populations residing in nursing homes. But as data started coming out, Mayberry saw that the deaths in other facilities were skyrocketing. Read MoreAnd then, in mid-April, she said she learned from staff that a resident somewhere in the building had tested positive for the disease. Since the early days of the pandemic, nursing homes have been hit particularly hard -- grappling with supply shortages and accounting for tens of thousands of deaths. But it is difficult to know what is actually happening inside these facilities, as measures aimed at protecting residents from the spread of the disease have left them even more vulnerable and closed off from the public. \n\n\n\nWhat should we investigate next?\n\nEmail Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken\n\n\nThey have been locked away from friends and family, routine government inspections have been severely limited due to the virus and some employees fear retaliation for raising concerns. It is even more rare to hear from the residents themselves -- since many suffer from dementia and other debilitating conditions or don't have an outlet to share their stories. Mayberry, now 66, said she felt that local government officials weren't doing enough to protect residents in nursing homes. She knew many of her fellow residents didn't have the ability to speak out. But she had an iPad and a Twitter account, so she began sending dispatches from the inside of her room and hoped that someone would see them. \"As a nursing home resident, I feel as though I am in #DeathCamp2020 and we just got our first #COVID19 case 2 days ago,\" she wrote on April 12. \"No testing for staff or patients. Please help us.\"Mayberry has been sharing her experience as a resident at Bel Tooren Villa Convalescent Hospital through Twitter. Mayberry never envisioned spending the early years of her retirement in a nursing home. She had a nearly 40-year career at a local school district working as a computer technician and retired in 2015, only to develop a dangerous skin infection, she said. Then, she said she suffered a broken leg and shattered ankle from a fall during her recovery. The injuries ultimately left her bedridden as she attempted to find a way to pay for the surgery she would need. She was single with no kids, and her brother lived hundreds of miles away in Oregon. Because she needed full-time care, Mayberry resorted to becoming a paying patient at the nursing home, Bel Tooren Villa Convalescent Hospital, owned by the national chain Life Care Centers of America. She had a surgery scheduled for the end of March that she hoped would finally enable her to move back into the home she owns in Long Beach, only around 15 minutes from her facility.  But then, coronavirus hit. Mayberry has always been outspoken. In earlier years, she wrote letters to the editor of her local newspaper, opposing the renaming of her childhood park and criticizing the \"stock\" obituary of a local woman and classic film actress, saying she deserved much better. And she was already active on Twitter before the pandemic, criticizing President Donald Trump and sharing her love of old cinema with her modest list of 200-something followers, which includes a small stable of movie buffs. Linda MayberryThe official Twitter account for the Los Angeles City Attorney became a follower more recently, after Mayberry saw a tweet about a price gouging investigation and responded with a photo of the same bottle of hand sanitizer being sold for $80 that still had its $1.99 price tag. Now, as she learned from several of the nurses taking care of her that a growing number of employees and fellow residents were also testing positive for the virus, she said she made it her mission to draw attention to people like her, who are stuck in nursing homes where the coronavirus is spreading.Related: Covid-19 is ravaging nursing homes. Government records show whyIn some cases, she replied directly to tweets from government officials and journalists. In others, she simply offered dispatches of what her life was like, detailing the outrage and frustration she was feeling. She didn't know if anyone was seeing them, but it made her feel like she was doing something. \"I could scream to the four walls here, but they don't listen very well,\" she said. It is bad enough that I haven't been tested since there is a positive #COVID19 case in my nursing home. But not to test the staff is bordering on Criminal Negligence. https://t.co/ofdyI9gTht\u2014 Linda (@Neurosturgeon) April 21, 2020 Mayberry tweeted about how she spent weeks asking to be tested -- and how it finally happened last month.A nurse showed up in her room in protective gear several days after her 66th birthday to deliver the news. She was positive for the virus and needed to be moved to the isolation unit -- which Mayberry described as starting with a hallway of the facility blocked off by a thick layer of plastic that hung from the ceiling to floor but growing to take over a large part of the building.A snapshot from inside Mayberry's room in the facility's makeshift isolation unit.\"Keeping the sick here and not testing the staff was a recipe for disaster,\" she told CNN in late May. \"I am really pissed off. This didn't have to happen.\"When staff at her nursing home discovered that she had been publicly voicing concerns about the situation, she said she was \"grilled by a corporate bigwig.\" A Life Care spokesman told CNN that residents are free to speak with reporters and that it would never punish someone for doing so. The company will speak to residents concerned about their care to try to resolve any issues, he added. Mayberry said she told them her anger was mainly directed at the Department of Public Health in Los Angeles County, where her facility is located, for failing to ensure that all employees were tested for coronavirus until recently.Thank you. Tested positive on May 15, so I am hoping I don't get any worse. The isolation within a locked down facility is crazy. It took me a month after the first positive case to get sick. 41 positive here. I hear only 8 patients don't have it. The Health Dept. Is to blame.\u2014 Linda (@Neurosturgeon) May 22, 2020 The first positive case had been confirmed well into the facility's lockdown so Mayberry was convinced that a staff member had unknowingly brought it to the facility. And as they went room to room treating patients like her, she worried they continued to spread it.The spokesman for Life Care said it was first notified of a positive case at Bel Tooren on April 10 and acknowledged that \"testing has been constrained, and has taken longer than we'd have liked\" -- noting that testing for the facility has been coordinated through the county health department.  \"They have made the decisions on when and who will be tested in our facility,\" he said. \"Our preference would have been to test both residents and staff sooner.\"What is your rationale for not testing the staffs at nursing homes, since there are so many dying but have no outside contact? Asymptomatic infection seems to be the cause. This seems like criminal negligence. https://t.co/DlDD2Bk7WF\u2014 Linda (@Neurosturgeon) April 17, 2020 The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said it has been working to support testing of both residents and staff at county nursing homes and that not all have completed this testing. A spokesman said the county will audit facilities to make sure they are complying with new state testing requirements, and said earlier this week that Bel Tooren is \"still under investigation.\"At first, the only personal possessions that were brought to the makeshift isolation unit for her were her iPad and iPhone. Her new room still had the belongings of someone else, she said, including fake flowers and a dresser full of items that she was afraid to touch. She said her temperature became slightly elevated and she noticed that her oxygen levels were lower than usual when she checked them herself using a pulse oximeter, but otherwise she said she was mainly asymptomatic. Soon after receiving her diagnosis, she began railing against people she believed were being irresponsible and spreading the virus, using the hashtag #Covidiots.According to Mayberry, she wasn't given a shower in more than a month, and that was the last day she was helped out of bed until recently. She was given a \"bed bath\" in mid-May, but claims that was only because she requested it for her birthday. \"It's been a little bit uncomfortable, but I understand they're just really, really shorthanded,\" she said, adding that many of the nurses have become like family to her. \"You feel sort of guilty that they're giving up so much to work here ... this isn't a job I would wish on anyone and they do it with kindness.\"Signs in the windows of Bel Tooren express gratitude for nursing home employees during the pandemic.After CNN contacted the facility spokesman for comment, Mayberry said she was retested and given a shower and moved from isolation -- suggesting that her test result came back negative for coronavirus this time. Her biggest fear is that employees -- some of whom she said are older than she is -- will stop coming to work entirely, as she has read about happening at other nursing homes. \"I am afraid that I am going to be ignored to death here,\" she said.I am in a nursing home and we have been so short-handed, RN's have had to do diaper changes because each CNA had 25 patients. Just know that the patients love you for what you are doing. And congratulations.\u2014 Linda (@Neurosturgeon) May 28, 2020 The Life Care spokesman said he could not comment on specific patients due to privacy laws, but that \"normal routines for patient care have been adjusted, particularly for those patients who have tested positive.\" He said the facility is starting to see residents recover from the virus, and that when someone is listed as recovered, they are moved into a new wing of the nursing home -- apart from those residents who are positive or negative. Related: Nursing home workers warned government about safety violations before Covid-19 outbreaks and deathsHe said that for the safety of staff, and since many rooms do not have private showers, some residents are given sponge baths two to three times per week. \"We recognize this has been a difficult time for residents, their families, and our staff,\" he said. \"Our staff have endured much and are truly heroic for their efforts to stay and care for their patients, even while they are at risk for contracting the virus.\" 'The biggest problems at nursing homes include three clearly identifiable deficiencies: not enough testing, not enough protective gear, and not enough workers.\"As a nursing home resident. I agree. Please save us. https://t.co/zLO23olbaZ\u2014 Linda (@Neurosturgeon) May 3, 2020 Other than the bits of information she is able to glean from her caregivers, she said residents are not given any detailed updates on Covid-19 cases, so she regularly checks the data posted by the state to try to find out what is happening in her own building. More than 50 residents at Bel Tooren have contracted coronavirus. Before she was moved to isolation, and then to a different room, she was able to listen for sirens, knowing that an ambulance would likely be called if someone had died. But lately she said she has been too far away to hear anything. As of May 29, Bel Tooren Villa Convalescent Hospital has reported 61 resident cases and 16 staff cases, according to the facility. Twelve of Mayberry's fellow residents have died. Do you have anything to share about Covid-19 in nursing homes? Is there something else you think we should investigate? Email us: watchdog@cnn.com.",

        "content": "(CNN)A flu shot will protect you from coronavirus, a worker reported being told by supervisors at a Rhode Island nursing home, where at least 60 residents were diagnosed with Covid-19 and at least one died.Keep working, an employee who was vomiting and running a temperature at an Ohio long-term care facility was instructed, according to another worker complaint.No need to tell authorities, a worker reported being told about the Covid-19 related deaths of colleagues at a Missouri nursing home.These employee accounts were drawn from more than 500 complaints filed in recent months with the federal government's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and state worker safety programs approved by the agency. A CNN review of these records, along with reports made to other government officials and interviews with employees, show that long-term care workers across the country feel their own lives are at risk as they work on the frontlines in facilities that have become hotbeds for Covid-19 -- with more than 10,000 deaths nationwide. Read More\n\n\n\nWhat should we investigate next?\n\nEmail Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken\n\n\nLike hospitals, nursing homes have faced severe supply shortages during the pandemic and have been urgently seeking assistance from the government. Worker complaints allege dangerous conditions in which staff members are deprived of basic protective gear and have been told to use coffee filters as masks and wear garbage bags or rain ponchos as medical gowns. The employees say they have been kept in the dark about outbreaks in their own facilities as they care for elderly and frail residents who are particularly susceptible to the disease.Some of the employees' grievances, CNN found, were made just days or weeks before Covid-19 outbreaks and deaths were announced at the same facilities. Other complaints were lodged after management was allegedly well aware the virus was spreading throughout their facilities. Warning notices were posted on a door at an entrance to the Cedar Mountain Post Acute nursing facility in Yucaipa, Calif. There have been 21 resident deaths there -- the highest number of Covid-19 deaths in any facility in San Bernardino County.In New Jersey, for example, the 10 facilities where CNN identified complaints to OSHA have all had coronavirus deaths. In total, these locations reported around 500 cases and nearly 150 deaths. OSHA, which is charged with enforcing workplace safety laws, has faced criticism for its slow response to complaints related to Covid-19. A spokesperson told CNN the agency investigates all complaints and \"has been acting to protect America's workers\" -- saying it is paying \"particular attention to protections for health care workers, emergency responders, and others with a heightened exposure to coronavirus.\"The same day CNN published its story, OSHA issued an alert with guidance for long-term care employers, providing safety tips to reduce coronavirus exposure in the workplace which included sending sick workers home and regularly monitoring supplies of PPE.  Yet, the records show that OSHA has closed many complaints after operators denied the claims or promised to address alleged issues. On-site inspections, which the agency says it launches to investigate the most serious allegations, were rare. Government employees: What public records should we request as we report on the coronavirus?In the worst examples, employees reported that managers hid positive cases from staff, meaning caregivers had no way of knowing for sure whether they were treating a patient with the disease. They expressed concerns over a lack of preparation, training and supplies to prevent them from contracting and spreading the virus. Employees have also reported staff being forced to work while symptomatic for Covid-19.\"Management is not telling the staff what's really happening nor are they taking the correct steps to prevent the illnesses,\" an employee claimed in March about a Michigan facility, which declined to comment on the complaint. Even though residents were \"non-stop coughing\" and \"very sick with temperatures and upper respiratory issues\" -- and some had died -- the complaint said staff were told they couldn't wear masks and that hand sanitizer was being hidden from employees. Warnings to the governmentUnder federal regulations, employers are supposed to protect workers from hazardous conditions. During the pandemic, that includes requiring the use of gloves and respiratory protection \"when job hazards warrant it\" and ensuring workplaces are \"free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm,\" according to OSHA's website.The more than 500 complaints identified by CNN come from employees working for long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes and assisted living centers, as well as hospice and home health care companies. They were filed with OSHA, as well as states with OSHA-approved worker safety programs, and date from early March to early May. OSHA was continuing to investigate more than 300 open complaints, according to the most recent data posted on the agency's website. More than 200 long-term care complaints had already been closed, meaning OSHA reviewed responses from employers and determined that further action was not warranted. OSHA officials can close complaints if there is \"information indicating the employer is aware of the hazard and is correcting it,\" according to guidance on its website, meaning that just because a complaint has been closed does not mean it was found to be invalid.Covid-19 is ravaging nursing homes. Government records show whyOfficials at the nursing home accused of not reporting worker deaths, for example, said in their written response to OSHA that they didn't report one employee's death because they had only later learned it may have been related to Covid-19, and that the autopsy results were still pending. Representatives of the facilities where employees complained of wearing rain ponchos, being told to work while sick, or that a flu shot would protect workers from Covid-19, denied the accusations in statements to CNN.  Deborah Berkowitz, director of the worker health and safety program at the National Employment Law Project, criticized the lack of thorough oversight by OSHA in connection to Covid-19. \"All the employer needs to tell OSHA is we are trying,\" said Berkowitz, who previously served as chief of staff and then a senior policy adviser for OSHA.OSHA provided data to CNN showing that it had opened more than 40 Covid-19 related inspections into nursing facilities. The majority of these were triggered by employee deaths or hospitalizations, and only two were opened at facilities where there were worker complaints, according to the data available. Only three states with their own OSHA-approved worker safety programs had opened any inspections at nursing facilities related to complaints, according to OSHA. While details about open complaints and inspections are not publicly available, the allegations made by workers in the closed complaints provide a window into the kinds of concerns nursing home workers are expressing to the government.At Opis Coquina Center, a Florida nursing home where the state says 16 residents have died and at least 11 workers have contracted the virus, an employee told OSHA in early April that leaders allegedly waited days to tell staff about a resident who tested positive for Covid-19. The center's corporate owner said it could not comment on the specific information in the complaint, but noted that it had been closed without any action against the facility. Also last month, a worker at the Cardigan Nursing & Rehabilitation Center in Massachusetts reported that residents weren't being tested for Covid-19, and that the facility was reporting them as negative when there was evidence they were positive. The local health department was not being informed of the \"assumed positive\" cases either, the complaint alleged. Nursing homes still struggle to get protective gear and quick testing The state has not released information about where the more than 3,000 long-term care deaths have occurred in Massachusetts, but publishes a list of all facilities with two or more cases. An administrator at Cardigan, which is not on that list, declined to say whether there had been any deaths -- only stating that Cardigan does not fall into the category of two or more positive Covid-19 cases. She denied the allegations in the complaint and noted that it had been closed.The most common problem threatening long-term care employees was a lack of personal protective equipment, or PPE, which includes face masks, gloves and gowns. Some workers said they weren't provided with protective gear because of facility shortages, while others said their facilities didn't allow them to wear masks even if they had them.\"Long-term care providers are facing an unprecedented situation that has left them begging for testing, personal protective equipment (PPE) and staffing resources,\" said Mark Parkinson, president of the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living, a trade organization representing long-term care facilities. \"Just like hospitals, we have called for help. In our case, nobody has listened.\"   Many employees reported not being provided masks while working with residents who had tested positive for Covid-19 or were symptomatic. In some cases, the facilities accused of improper safety measures subsequently reported that coronavirus had infiltrated their facilities.  That was the case at Cedar Mountain Post Acute Rehabilitation in California. Five days after an employee filed a complaint about a shortage of masks there, county officials learned there was Covid-19 in the facility. Cedar Mountain has now reported that 77 residents have tested positive, as well as 36 staff members. There have been 21 resident deaths -- the highest number of Covid-19 deaths in any facility in San Bernardino County, according to state data. A facility spokesperson told CNN that Cedar Mountain \"was never short on PPE\" and that the facility's proper PPE usage and inventory had been verified by the county and state health departments, as well as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An employee filed a worker safety complaint in March about Cedar Mountain Post Acute nursing facility, which has now reported that nearly 80 residents have tested positive for Covid-19.The first positive case of coronavirus at Stafford Hill Assisted Living, in Massachusetts, was reported to the town nearly two weeks after a complaint was made to OSHA. The employee said the facility had not developed or communicated a plan to reduce employees' risk of Covid-19 and that supervisors weren't allowing staff to wear masks, even when they brought their own. A spokeswoman for the facility acknowledged that an employee was told not to wear a homemade mask to work even though medical grade masks were unavailable and said the facility was following CDC guidance at the time. She said that when the complaint was made, Stafford Hill was days away from securing medical masks and emphasized that when the employee requested to wear the homemade mask, there had been no positive cases. Since then, however, 14 staff members have tested positive, and 20 residents, according to the facility. There have been three deaths -- all residents.Four days after Avista Healthcare in New Jersey reported a Covid-19 outbreak to the county, a worker worried about the virus spreading to staff. The worker told OSHA that employees caring for a suspected Covid-19 resident were not given proper PPE and that the same resident was being allowed into common areas. State data shows there have been 60 positive cases at the facility and 18 deaths. The facility did not respond to a request for comment. In a May letter reviewed by CNN, a Camden County official told the state health department that the county had been \"diligently assessing the facilities and educating the staff on infection control measures\" and had \"very serious concerns\" about Avista and other facilities. He asked the state health department, which said the letter is under review, to immediately install a state monitor to keep tabs on the facility -- an action typically only taken when there is a situation that places the health and safety of residents in potential jeopardy. 'This is healthcare providers crying out for help'Nursing home employees have also turned to elected officials for help -- desperate for someone to intervene and echoing many of the concerns detailed in the OSHA complaints filed about other facilities.\"For many weeks we have been working extremely short staffed!\" an employee at the Life Care Center of Nashoba Valley wrote to officials in Littleton, Massachusetts, according to records obtained by CNN. \"Instead of managers stepping up and helping us that are struggling to keep patients safe they're in [their] offices. The Friday our first patient tested positive we were wearing masks and were told we couldn't do that cause (we) were contaminating the floor.\" Littleton documents show that town officials received at least 12 calls and messages from employees as deaths mounted there in April -- eventually becoming the site of 14 deaths and more than 80 positive cases among residents and staff. One employee reported testing positive for the virus but received no response after calling the facility in an attempt to let management know. A spokesman acknowledged that calls may have gone unanswered because family members, town officials and the media had been overwhelming the phone lines and staff was \"prioritizing patient care.\"  As of April 13, the most recent data provided by Life Care, more than 30 employees at Life Care Center of Nashoba Valley had tested positive for the virus or were presumed to have contracted it because they showed symptoms.Another staff member was one of the first employees sent home with a fever, according to a message given to town officials, but hadn't been told of any cases at the facility so didn't get tested. Then the employee learned a colleague was in the hospital.  \"My dear friend and nurse is fighting for her life in the ICU sedated on a ventilator,\" the worker told town officials, according to records containing summaries and in some cases the full text of calls and messages they received from family members and workers. \"Never knew what was going on in the facility.\"The nurse this employee was concerned about later died, and after her death, a caller told the town that there were two more nurses in the ICU.A spokesman for Life Care Centers of America, the corporate owner of Nashoba Valley, told CNN that management immediately notified all staff of the first positive case at the end of March and that \"it is simply not true that we knew information related to the outbreak and didn't communicate this to our staff.\" He said that a state health department survey found the facility was in compliance with infection control regulations and preparation for Covid-19 -- including the proper use of protective equipment. Regarding the two additional nurses an employee claimed had gone to the ICU, he said one recovered and the other was a certified nursing assistant who went to the hospital but \"to our knowledge was never in the ICU.\" As of April 13, the most recent data provided by Life Care, more than 30 employees had tested positive for the virus or were presumed to have contracted it because they showed symptoms. Coroners worry Covid-19 test shortages could lead to uncounted deathsEven more recently, a Pennsylvania state senator, Katie Muth, has been inundated with text messages and calls from employees at a state-run veterans home where her office said there had been around 50 deaths since April 1 -- though not all had been definitively linked to Covid-19. The state did not provide figures for the Southeast Veterans' Center, but said its system of six veterans homes had reported 101 resident cases, 47 staff cases and 39 confirmed or probable Covid-19 deaths.Muth said workers at the Southeast Veterans' Center reported that supervisors were putting pressure on them to erase signs of the disease from medical charts and records and to come to work even after testing positive for Covid-19. \"This is healthcare providers crying out for help,\" Muth said in a statement. The senator, along with the county coroner, has called for an investigation into the facility's handling of the outbreak.Pennsylvania State Sen. Katie MuthA spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, which operates the facility, said that it takes all concerns from its staff very seriously and has been following CDC guidelines of when it is appropriate to bring employees back to work. She said the department has an officer who is responsible \"for ensuring that all employee inquiries are addressed and appropriately resolved\" -- noting that the veterans home had recently passed state and county inspections and these had found that the facility was using the correct protocols. One employee at the veterans home, who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of losing her job, told CNN that what has become a desperate situation all began when the facility banned staff from wearing PPE up until the first week of April. Management, she complained, said wearing masks might \"scare or insult\" residents. A colleague was even disciplined for wearing his own mask to work, she said. She said employees undoubtedly spread the virus throughout the facility as they delivered meals, and that even though certain residents were clearly displaying symptoms of Covid-19, she heard supervisors telling staff they weren't sick. Supervisors have also called and \"bullied\" workers who tested positive, she said, telling them to come to work or not get paid. The state said it could not comment on employee-related matters.  Even as scrutiny on the veterans home has intensified, she said her bosses were putting pressure on employees to stay quiet about just how bad the situation has become.She would have quit by now, but she views the veterans at the facility as her \"adopted family.\" Each morning, she said she cringes as she logs into the facility's system to see whose name is the latest to pop up on her screen as \"expired.\"Do you have anything to share about Covid-19 in nursing homes?

        "content": "(CNN)A new federal criminal indictment against three alleged insurrectionists who plotted their trip to Washington, DC, reveals more about their preparations than was previously known, including their discussing or attending training camps.The Justice Department indicted Thomas Caldwell of Virginia and Jessica Watkins and Donovan Crowl of Ohio on Wednesday, alleging that the three are affiliated with the Oath Keepers, a right-wing extremist group, and that Watkins discussed a basic training camp in Ohio and Crowl attended training in North Carolina before January 6. The Oath Keepers generally believe the federal government has been corrupted and that former military and police can defend the Constitution as a self-styled militia, according to court records. Paramilitary groups have become a major focus of investigators as they work toward understanding why attendees of the Trump rally were armed and wore body armor, and how groups of extremists may have coordinated before the siege. And the mentions of training camps have dotted some of the early court records charging paramilitary-linked rioters with federal crimes.This is at least the second case related to the Capitol riots where defendants are alleged to have ties to military-style training. In the other case, against Robert Gieswein of Colorado, federal law enforcement say he wore to the Capitol a patch on his tactical vest representing a group called the Woodland Wild Dogs, a private paramilitary training organization that he allegedly runs.Read MoreGeiswein also was indicted on Wednesday by the grand jury in DC on six counts, including using an irritant spray and a baseball bat against US Capitol Police.Paramilitary training had also been a feature of the case against right-wing extremists in Michigan who had plotted to kidnap the Democratic governor and took part in tactical training.At a news conference this week, the US attorney in Washington, DC -- Michael Sherwin -- described the Caldwell case as one that showed active planning among militia groups, and said law enforcement was working toward building sedition conspiracy cases. The indictment filed on Wednesday against the alleged Oath Keepers does not include a sedition count, though it accuses Caldwell, Crowl and Watkins of speaking to one another and others about ways they could hamper Congress' certification of the Electoral College vote confirming Joe Biden as the 46th president.The three allegedly communicated for almost two months before January 6 about how they would prepare, including by talking about training.'Basic training class' In early November, nearly a week after the presidential election, Watkins texted people who were interested in her paramilitary group in Ohio about a week-long \"Basic Training class\" run by a drill sergeant near Columbus to become \"fighting fit\" for the inauguration, prosecutors revealed on Wednesday.Prosecutors also highlighted that Crowl attended a training camp in North Carolina in December.Watkins also responded to an invitation to a \"leadership\" conference call about a \"DC op\" on the encrypted messaging app Signal.Caldwell and Crowl also allegedly messaged about meeting up with a \"North Carolina crew,\" the indictment says.Prosecutors say that in addition to the Oath Keepers, Watkins and Crowl also are part of a group called the Ohio State Regular Militia, which has some members who pay dues to the Oath Keepers.The indictment approved by the grand jury in DC Wednesday formalizes four charges that prosecutors had previously leveled against the three, including conspiracy, obstructing an official proceeding, destroying government property and unlawfully entering the restricted grounds of the US Capitol.When they were first charged, the case was the first significant conspiracy allegations related to the Capitol attack. The Justice Department alleges that the three extremists planned and coordinated ahead of the January 6 assault, beginning in November of last year as they discussed lodging and meet-ups in Washington. The indictment filed on Wednesday added details about the Oath Keepers' use of the walkie-talkie-like app Zello to communicate and their intentions for January 6.Watkins, for instance, allegedly said on a channel called \"Stop the Steal J6,\" \"We have a good group. We have about 30-40 of us. We are sticking together and sticking to the plan,\" the Justice Department said.In other messages via text and Facebook leading up to January 6, Caldwell wrote about a need to \"get violent\" and a \"call to action\" in Washington.They discussed buses of people coming from around the country, including North Carolina, and three unnamed people they were in communication with, according to the indictment.Prosecutors say Watkins and Crowl left Ohio to stay with Caldwell in Virginia after the siege, before their arrests.The three have not yet responded to the indictment formally in federal court in Washington.",

        "content": "(CNN)It is an internet battle cry: Stop the Steal has swept across inboxes, Facebook pages and Twitter like an out-of-control virus, spreading misinformation and violent rhetoric -- and spilling into real life, like the protest planned for DC this weekend.  But while Stop the Steal may sound like a new 2020 political slogan to many, it did not emerge organically over widespread concerns about voting fraud in President Donald Trump's race against Joe Biden. It has been in the works for years.  Its origin traces to Roger Stone, a veteran Republican operative and self-described \"dirty trickster\" whose 40-month prison sentence for seven felonies was cut short by Trump's commutation in July. Stone's political action committee launched a \"Stop the Steal\" website in 2016 to fundraise ahead of that election, asking for $10,000 donations by saying, \"If this election is close, THEY WILL STEAL IT.\" Supporters of President Donald Trump protest outside the Clark County Election Department on November 7 in Nevada. He first trotted out the slogan during the 2016 primaries -- claiming a \"Bush-Cruz-Kasich-Romney-Ryan-McConnell faction\" was attempting to steal the Republican nomination from Donald Trump -- before re-upping Stop the Steal for the general election. Read More\"Donald Trump thinks Hillary Clinton and the Democrats are going to steal the next election,\" his website said that October.  Stop the Steal briefly resurfaced around the midterms in 2018 -- with Republicans employing the hashtag during a recount in a neck-and-neck Florida race for U.S. Senate -- but it wasn't until 2020 that it really caught fire.   A Stop the Steal Facebook group was managed by a loose coalition of right wing operatives, some of whom have worked with former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. The group amassed hundreds of thousands of followers in little more than a day before Facebook shut it down on November 5 -- the day after it was launched. Also on November 5, Bannon started his own \"Stop the Steal\" Facebook group; he changed the name to \"Own Your Vote\" the following day. It was not removed by Facebook, but the social media company did later remove several other pages affiliated with Bannon.  \"We've removed several clusters of activity for using inauthentic behavior tactics to artificially boost how many people saw their content,\" said Andy Stone, a Facebook spokesman. \"That includes a group that was originally named Stop the Steal, which later became Gay Communists for Socialism and misled people about its purpose using deceptive tactics.\" Spinoff pages sprung up soon after like brush fires, with Facebook struggling to quickly snuff out the spreaders of bogus information.  All the while, Roger Stone and Bannon have been in full disinformation mode. Stone has appeared on the show of far-right radio commentator Alex Jones to trumpet groundless claims that Biden is trying to steal the election; Bannon is echoing similar conspiracy theories on his podcast, calling the election \"a mass fraud.\" \"We're calling it a fraud or we're calling it a steal -- stop the steal,\" he said on a November 4 episode. Despite efforts by Facebook to shut down the misleading content, it was too late. The cluster of groups and pages -- which altogether had amassed 2.5 million followers, according to an analysis by activist group Avaaz -- had seeded a jungle of misinformation that is being shared -- and believed -- by millions of Americans.  Dozens of people calling for stopping the vote count in Pennsylvania due to alleged fraud against President Donald Trump gather on the steps of the State Capitol on November 5 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. \"I would not consider this a grassroots movement by any means,\" said Ben Decker, the CEO and founder of Memetica, a digital investigations consultancy. \"Stop the Steal is a highly coordinated partisan political operation intent on bringing together conspiracy theorists, militias, hate groups and Trump supporters to attack the integrity of our election.\" The movement has also migrated to in-person events, Decker said, manifesting itself \"in a variety of offline rallies and protests featuring a number of participants that are often armed.\"  Some of the violent rhetoric associated with the campaign has come from its own leaders.  \"Clean your guns,\" said Dustin Stockton, one of the administrators of the Facebook Stop the Steal group, on a Facebook Live Stream video to his followers. \"Things are going to get worse before they get better.\" Stockton acknowledged CNN's request for comment but didn't respond to questions. Stockton previously told CNN he did not see any messages within the group \"calling for violence outside of what is common political hyperbole.\" He said Facebook's removal of the page was \"out of line and they should restore it immediately.\" Stop the Steal triggered voter-intimidation lawsuits in 2016 When Stone launched Stop the Steal in 2016, it wasn't just a campaign slogan and fundraising website -- it also became a self-described \"vote protectors\" project that sought volunteers to monitor polling places. Stone told CNN this week that the purpose of the group was \"to insure the integrity of the vote.\"The project triggered a slew of federal lawsuits just before Election Day by Democratic parties in six battleground states accusing Stone and affiliates of trying to intimidate minority voters in the cities where he intended to send volunteers.  A federal suit filed in Ohio, for instance, accused Stone's Stop the Steal project of violating the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by \"conspiring to intimidate, threaten, harass, or coerce voters on Election Day.\" A judge granted a temporary restraining order against the group, but it was lifted on appeal.  Today, StopTheSteal.org redirects to Stone's personal web page, \"StoneColdTruth.com,\" where Stone has been posting conspiracy theories about \"widespread voter fraud.\"  Roger Stone, former adviser and confidante to President Donald Trump, was sentenced on February 20 to 40 months in prison. Trump later commuted Stone's sentence.This week, he appeared on Alex Jones's show, where Stone groundlessly pronounced that Biden's election was a \"hoax\" and made a plug for Stop the Steal.  \"I think our headline is Join the Patriots in Washington, D.C. this weekend to protest the hoax that is the theft of this election and demand that we Stop the Steal,\" he said, adding, \"hashtag Stop the Steal.\"  In an email, Stone responded pugnaciously to a question from CNN about whether the current Stop the Steal movement is a recycled version of the false narrative of mass voter fraud he led years before.  \"As for the lack of evidence that is the mantra of all you flying monkeys,\" he wrote. \"It's like denying the Holocaust. The evidence is overwhelming and compelling, despite the framing of your question.\" Stone defended the recycling of the slogan in his email, attempting to draw a parallel to other mass protests that share a theme, such as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s March on Washington in 1963 and The Million Man March -- a gathering of Black men in Washington, DC, in 1995. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\n\n\n\nStone distanced himself from Bannon, referring to him as an \"enemy of the people.\" Bannon didn't respond to messages from CNN seeking comment.This fall, as the 2020 election drew closer, there was talk in right wing circles of dusting off the Stop the Steal campaign again -- but not by Stone.  \"I'm thinking about bringing Stop the Steal out of retirement,\" said right wing activist Ali Alexander, formerly known as Ali Akbar, in a video he circulated on social media in September. \"In the next coming days we are going to build the infrastructure to stop the steal.\"  Alexander, a controversial figure on the right whose tweets about Jewish journalists have raised eyebrows, says he employed a successful Stop the Steal campaign during the 2018 midterms in Florida. This year, Alexander's company registered another Stop the Steal website -- StoptheSteal.us -- on November 4.  Alexander did not directly respond to CNN's questions for this story. Also on November 4, the Stop the Steal Facebook group was launched by an organization led by a woman with ties to Stone's ex-wife and managed by a team of several conservative activists, some with close connections to Bannon. Amy Kremer is the chair of Women for America First -- an organization which created the Stop the Steal Facebook group, according to Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), a London-based think tank that monitors online polarization and extremism. Kremer was a lead Tea Party organizer who also started a super PAC with Stone's ex-wife, Ann Stone, called Women Vote Trump.In an emailed response to a set of questions from CNN, Kremer did not deny that Stop the Steal is a planned, recycled version of a similar gambit. She declined to answer a question about the extent to which she was coordinating the Stop the Steal efforts with high-profile right wing operatives, but said: \"We welcome the support and involvement of any individual who is concerned about the integrity of our elections and who supports President Trump.\" The administrators for the Stop the Steal Facebook group also included Dustin Stockton and Jennifer Lawrence, a couple who have both written for Breitbart -- where Bannon once served as executive chairman, according to ISD. Both also were part of Bannon's core team for We Build the Wall, an ill-fated crowdfunding campaign for Trump's border wall that led to the arrest this summer of Bannon and three associates on suspicion of using hundreds of thousands of dollars in proceeds for personal expenses. Stockton and Lawrence were not among those arrested and indicted in August, but their recreational vehicle was raided by federal agents as a part of the probe. Bannon pleaded not guilty to the charges. In an interview last week, Stockton told CNN that the Facebook group had had no contact with Bannon prior to its November 4 creation or while it was active. \"We haven't been able to speak to anyone from that circle since August and the indictments,\" he said.  'The horse has bolted' Supporters of President Donald Trump hold \"Stop the Steal\" signs as they stand outside of the Clark County Elections Department in Nevada on November 7.The Stop the Steal Facebook group took off immediately. Its size swelled at a dizzying pace, gaining some 300,000 followers in just 24 hours.  Some commenters on that Stop the Steal Facebook group and its knockoffs used \"threatening rhetoric anticipating a civil war, or talk from members about how they are locked and loaded,\" said Ciaran O'Connor, a disinformation analyst with the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.  Citing one of the most extreme comments he came across, O'Connor said a user on one of the Facebook groups said they would die fighting for what they believe. \"Since then, this thread has over 450 comments in support of the original statement, with many saying that they would happily do the same,\" he said. Decker of Memetica said he watched the Facebook group radicalize people in real time during the peak of its virality.   \"You had otherwise normal Trump supporters who suddenly wanted to understand what was being done against President Trump in this election,\" he said. \"And suddenly you see comments where people are asking, 'What is this QAnon thing?' 'What is red pilling?' And immediately you see all of these different users engage and share harmful, toxic conspiracy theories that they otherwise would have never seen had they not joined the group.\" The Stop the Steal hashtag has also spread widely on Twitter.   Seeded by a spate of tweets by Ali Alexander and others at least as early as September, the hashtag took off on Election Day -- November 3 -- with a tweet by a lawyer showing a video of a poll watcher in Philadelphia arguing with poll workers who wouldn't let him in the building. The man was indeed wrongfully turned away; city officials told news outlets it was an \"honest mistake\" and that the poll watcher went to another polling site.  The tweet went viral, boosted by retweets from famous conservative firebrands such as Ann Coulter and Donald Trump Jr. Other conservative influencers picking up the hashtag on Twitter were Rudy Giuliani, Michelle Malkin and Dinesh D'Souza, a conservative activist and filmmaker who pleaded guilty to making illegal campaign contributions and was pardoned by Trump. All told, the hashtag was tweeted 1.7 million times, mostly after November 5, said Darren L. Linvill, an associate professor in the department of communications at Clemson University who tracks the spread of information online. Meanwhile, many of those banned from or restrained by the two Big Tech companies have migrated to emerging platforms such as Parler, which became the most-downloaded free app in the Apple app store on the weekend of November 8 -- the day major media outlets called the election for Biden.  Despite efforts by tech companies and fact checkers, the bogus charge that the election has been stolen has entered the bloodstream of American democracy. \"There are still groups active with tens of thousands of members, over 170 Facebook Stop the Steal events, the last time I counted,\" O'Connor said. \"The horse has bolted at this stage.\"  The hyper-polarized rhetoric around the election worries Steven Levitsky, a Harvard government professor and co-author of the 2018 book \"How Democracies Die.\"  \"When people lose faith in the electoral process and don't think elections are clean and legitimate, they are much more willing to accept violence,\" he said. The onus, Levitsky said, is on Republicans in Congress to assure the public that the election was legitimate.  So far, that hasn't happened. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has yet to recognize Biden as the winner. To date only a handful of GOP leaders in Congress have done so.

        "content": "(CNN)For the third time in three days, an Alaska health care worker had an allergic reaction after receiving a dose of the new Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine.A clinician in Fairbanks on Thursday experienced \"a probable anaphylactic reaction\" about 10 minutes after the injection during an observation period, according to leadership at Foundation Health Partners (FHP), a health care system linked to Fairbanks Memorial Hospital. The clinician had symptoms of tongue swelling, hoarse voice and difficulty breathing, according to FHP. The clinician, a female two-year employee, was transported from the vaccine clinic to Fairbanks Memorial Hospital, where she was administered two doses of epinephrine. She remained at the hospital for observation and was released six hours later. According to FHP, the employee reported she had no known allergies, though she once experienced a reaction to a bee sting.The clinician was one of nearly 300 employees to receive the vaccine Thursday. What we know about Moderna's coronavirus vaccine and how it differs from Pfizer'sRead MoreEarlier in the week, two Alaska health care workers in Juneau also had allergic reactions after Covid-19 injections. The first worker on Tuesday was taken to the emergency room after reporting shortness of breath. According to Dr. Lindy Jones, an attending physician at Bartlett Regional Hospital in Juneau, the worker had an elevated heart rate and developed a rash covering her face and torso. She was given epinephrine and responded well.Over the course of the evening, however, symptoms re-emerged and the worker was provided steroids and an epinephrine drip. By the next day, the worker had stabilized. Jones said the worker had no prior history of vaccine allergies.A second worker on Wednesday \"experienced eye puffiness, light headedness, and scratchy throat ten minutes after being injected with the vaccine,\" according to a statement from Bartlett Regional. After being administered epinephrine, Pepcid and Benadryl, the worker was \"completely back to normal within an hour and was released.\"'We are getting crushed.' What's behind the alarming rise in California's Covid-19 casesThe two in Juneau worked in the same hospital system, and it is unclear if there are any other connections between the two incidents. Both incidents were reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state health authorities. FHP stated they also shared details of Thursday's reaction to state and federal agencies.The Pfizer vaccine has been hailed for its safety during clinical trials, though some precautions may be necessary for those with a known history of severe allergic reactions. The FDA has said there is a \"remote chance\" that the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine could cause a severe allergic reaction. But because so many people are talking the vaccine at once, the public may perceive these severe reactions as being far more common than they are. Pfizer commented in a statement obtained by CNN affiliate KTVF.\"We don't yet have all the details of the recent report from Alaska about a potential serious allergic reaction but are actively working with local health authorities to assess. We will closely monitor all reports suggestive of serious allergic reactions following vaccination and update labeling language if needed.\"The company said clear warnings are provided, precautions are advised, and medical treatment and supervision \"should always be readily available\" in the event of a severe allergic reaction. The company also noted that those with a history of such reactions were excluded from Phase 3 trials.\"Overall, there were no safety signals of concern identified in our clinical trials, including no signal of serious allergic reactions associated with vaccine. However, reports of adverse events outside of clinical studies are a very important component to our pharmacovigilance activities and we will review all available information on this case and all reports of adverse events following vaccination,\" the statement said.The clinician in Fairbanks, who wished to maintain her privacy, according to FHP, released the following statement encouraging others to get the vaccine:\"Anaphylaxis is a rare but expected potential side effect that is treatable and does not have long term health implications like Covid. I would get the vaccine and recommend it to anyone, despite my reaction, to help our country get immunized which is needed for the health of all Americans, for the economy, get families hugging again, for getting children back to schools, and to get the country on the other side of this pandemic. \"I've seen firsthand the suffering and death of Covid patients and my adverse reaction to the vaccine pales to what Covid infection can do to people.\"CNN's Danielle Sills, Nadia Kounang and Virginia Langmaid contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Woodstock, Ohio (CNN)In her Ohio hometown, she's known as an Army veteran who runs a bar and set up a small\u202fself-styled militia\u202fher boyfriend says she created to help neighbors if tornadoes hit.To the FBI, she's a\u202fmilitant leader who traveled to Washington, DC, and stormed the US Capitol, encouraging\u202fothers to do the same.\u202f\u202f The two worlds of Jessica Watkins crashed into each other in the\u202fsmall\u202fvillage of Woodstock, Ohio, when FBI agents turned up early one morning to arrest her for her alleged role in the January\u202f6\u202finsurrection.  Jessica Watkins, in military gear, was seen on video taking part in the uprising at the Capitol.\"We could hear so many sirens. And then we heard them yelling for her to come downstairs with her hands up and she did not,\" said Emma Dixon, who witnessed the pre-dawn raid from a home across the street.\u202f\u202f Watkins was seen on video taking part in the insurrection that is linked to the deaths of five people and that terrified lawmakers, who were forced to run to hiding places, fearing for their lives. Read MoreWhen the FBI arrived in Woodstock, Watkins was not there. Her boyfriend, Montana Siniff was. He told CNN disorientating flash-bangs were used.\u202f\u202fA window was broken. It remained that way days later.\u202f FBI agents\u202fquestioned him and eventually\u202fleft, he said. In a complaint filed in court, federal prosecutors said agents\u202frecovered what \"appears to be directions for making explosives, authored by 'the Jolly Roger.'\" Jolly Roger is also the name of Watkins' bar and a Facebook account believed to be linked to her, authorities say.\u202f\u202f\u202f \"That is entirely false. She hates explosives. There is no moral or lawful way to really make use of explosives as a regular citizen,\" Siniff said. Montana Siniff told CNN that Jessica Watkins was not a violent person. \"She can be very spirited, but she is a very good person at heart and she just really wants to try to help people.\"Watkins, 38,\u202fis now detained at the Montgomery County Jail, about 50 miles away in Dayton,\u202fafter she handed herself in to authorities last Sunday.Records show Watkins served in the Army under a different name from April 2001 to December 2003. She was deployed to Afghanistan from September to December 2002. Watkins is accused, along with two other military veterans, of\u202fa multitude of charges: conspiracy,\u202fconspiracy to impede an officer, destruction of government property, obstruction of an official proceeding, entering a restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and violent entry or disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.\u202f\u202f The\u202fthree veterans were the first\u202fto face conspiracy charges, some of the most severe charges so far for those who breached the Capitol on January 6.\u202f CNN has found a disproportionate number of people charged in the Capitol attack are former members of the military. 'The most beautiful thing' No one disputes that Watkins went to the Capitol to protest against the certification of President Joe Biden's election win.\u202fShe is seen on video bragging about it while inside the Capitol building.\u202f Her boyfriend said she went to \"help protect some Trump VIP members within the rally,\" but he did not know whom. After breaching the Capitol, Watkins described the scene inside the building as she saw it. She told the Ohio Capital Journal: \"To me, it was the most beautiful thing I ever saw until we started hearing glass smash. That's when we knew things had gotten really bad.\" Watkins is accused with two other military veterans of conspiracy in relation to the attack on the Capitol.She added: \"It was some people hijacking what started off as a peaceful movement.\" But the words on her Parler account after the breach offer a very different perspective. They are highlighted in the federal complaint against her. \"Yeah. We stormed the Capitol today. Teargassed, the whole, 9. Pushed our way into the Rotunda. Made it into the Senate even,\" she wrote. Another post from Watkins\u202fused as evidence\u202fby the FBI said: \"We never smashed anything, stole anything, burned anything, and truthfully we were very respectful with Capitol Hill PD until they attacked us.\u202f Then we stood our ground and drew the line.\" They swore to protect America. Some also joined the riotWatkins and many others came to Washington trained in warfare, some wearing their combat gear of ballistic helmets, Army fatigues and goggles.  Videos showed one group of more than a dozen people, in formation, hands on each other's shoulders, marching up the Capitol steps. Federal prosecutors say Watkins and others used the Zello phone app, which works like a walkie-talkie, to communicate and plan the assault.   Watkins has yet to have an attorney assigned to her. But her boyfriend did talk on her behalf. The two own the Jolly Roger bar together. They are both members of the group she \"commanded\" called the\u202fOhio State Regular Militia. \"She's not a violent person,\" Siniff told CNN. \"She can be very spirited, but she is a very good person at heart and she just really wants to try to help people.\" But law enforcement and many of the lawmakers inside say the rioters that breached the Capitol put lives in danger.  Links to far-right Oath Keepers Siniff said Watkins formed the militia to help victims of tornadoes when local authorities were absent or overwhelmed.\u202f There's a long history of paramilitary groups setting themselves up in rural areas of Ohio, Michigan and elsewhere,\u202fand\u202fthe FBI says sometimes there is a darker side.\u202f Decoding the extremist symbols and groups at the Capitol Hill insurrection Watkins is a member of the Oath Keepers, a pro-Trump, far-right, anti-government group that considers itself part of the militia movement charged to protect the country. There is no private citizen militia that exists in the US. A militia has to be sanctioned by the state. The Oath Keepers are clear that they try to recruit members from among active or retired military, first responders and\u202f police, and its name refers to the oath taken to \"defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.\"  In court documents the FBI says, \"Oath Keepers will violate federal law if they believe their cause is just.\" \u202f Recruiting veterans Watkins' alleged co-conspirators are named by the FBI as Donovan Crowl, a former Marine, and Thomas Caldwell, who served in the Navy.  Crowl lives just down the street from Watkins' Jolly Roger bar and was a regular there.\u202f Neighbors told CNN that Watkins would try to recruit people when they came into the bar. Most didn't take her up on it. But Crowl did join Watkins and Siniff in their armed group.\u202f Former Marine Donovan Crowl was among those in military garb at the Capitol.\"When drunk, he's the guy you want to shut up. \u202fWhen sober the best man you could have,\" Siniff said of the former Marine. \"The militia was a good thing to help him ... like it was a reason to be sober.\" CNN has reached out to Crowl's attorney but has not received a response.\u202f Crowl's criminal record shows charges for domestic abuse and drunk driving, some of which resulted in conviction. This was noted by the federal judge when his attorney tried to get him released before his trial. His attorney said he merited release as he was not a danger to society. \"He's seen on video saying, 'we overran the Capitol,' his criminal history includes violence and alcohol offenses, he also demonstrated prior non-compliance.\u202fThe suggestion to release him to a residence with nine firearms is a non-starter,\" Judge Sharon Ovington said. Crowl was remanded back into custody awaiting a preliminary hearing in Ohio. Crowl's mother, Teresa Joann Rowe,\u202ftold CNN her son has expressed increasingly hostile political views\u202fin recent years. \"It felt like he did a 180-degree turnaround, felt like the world owed him a living and had a big chip on his shoulder,\" Rowe said. \"I don't know if it's because life didn't go the way he planned.\" Donovan Crowl lives in the same village as Jessica Watkins.Asked why she thinks Crowl may have been drawn to this extremist group, she said, \"I would like to understand myself. I don't get it.\" Caldwell, the third veteran named as a co-conspirator, lives in a secluded property down a country road in Berryville, Virginia, 400 miles from the Woodstock homes of Watkins and Crowl. It is unclear how long Caldwell knew Crowl and Watkins.\u202f But the FBI says they met up in Washington, DC.  Crowl took video of himself and Watkins inside the Capitol and posted it on social media.  Outside the Capitol Caldwell made his feelings clear on January 6. \"Everyone single b in there is a traitor, every single one,\" he screamed in a video, appearing to refer to the legislators inside.\u202f Capitol riot dilemma: Which rioters should stay behind bars before trial?Caldwell was a name in his local Virginia political circles. He was a delegate to the Clarke County, Virginia, Republican convention last year. A lawyer temporarily assigned to Caldwell said at a detention hearing that his opposition to Biden's election win was not out of the ordinary, and that he was not accused of a violent crime.  But the judge disagreed: \"The conduct and statements of Mr. Caldwell and the others, it really is just pure lawlessness,\" Magistrate Judge Joel Hoppe of the federal court in Harrisonburg, Virginia, said on Tuesday. Strong support for WatkinsThe village of Woodstock is home to about 300 people. Many of the homes are clustered around the crossroads, and the only traffic signal still fly \"Trump 2020\" banners.\u202f There is also the \"Don't Tread on Me\" or Gadsden flag of the American Revolution and a Stars and Stripes being flown upside down -- a signal of \"dire distress,\" according to the US code. An upside-down Stars and Strips and a \"Don't Tread on Me\" Gadsden flag suggest anti-government feeling in Woodstock, Ohio.Some of the villagers were hostile to our CNN crew, calling the local sheriff to complain twice. Others were happier to talk and argued with their neighbors to back off.\u202f And even after all the video and social media posts showing Watkins ranting about storming the Capitol, Watkins's boyfriend defends her. \"I do not believe the charges of conspiracy are\u202fat all fair,\" Siniff said.

The new system aims to simplify eligibility, standardize information and data, and address the available supply of doses by streamlining the process, the department said.California has been hit hard by the pandemic.\"While vaccines remain extremely limited, the goal is to build a system to equitably and efficiently administer vaccines when supply increases,\" officials said in a statement.Thus far, 2.6 million doses have been administered in the state, which has a population of about 39 million.Read MoreThe announcement comes a day after the state lifted its regional stay-home orders, saying that four-week projections of the need for intensive care unit beds in hard-hit areas show enough capacity to exit the order.California lifts regional stay-at-home orders as ICU crowding easesIt also comes amid an effort to recall Gov. Gavin Newsom by political opponents who criticized the strict stay-home orders. Send us your questions for President Biden's Covid-19 teamStarting next month, all Californians in Phase 1B Tier 1 will be able to make an appointment to receive the vaccine under a standardized system. This includes health care workers, residents over 65 years old, and workers in education, child care, emergency services and food and agriculture sectors.Newsom shrugs off recall pressures as he lifts California's Covid restrictionsInstead of counties and hospitals running their own vaccination delivery systems, the state will use a third-party administrator to allocate vaccines directly to providers to maximize distribution efficiency, they said. Officials said the third-party administrator has not been selected.\"The vaccine provider network is expected to include public health systems, pharmacies, health systems, public hospitals, community health centers, pharmacies and pop-up and mobile sites,\" officials said.The new system will continue to focus on equity, and the state plans to make sure low-income neighborhoods and communities of colors will have access to the vaccine, officials said. In addition, \"providers will be compensated in part by how well they are able to reach underserved communities,\" state health officials said.\"We have learned that to accelerate pace we need to dial up the scale of our efforts to ensure vaccine supply goes into arms as quickly as it arrives in the state,\" Newsom said in a statement. The state is also launching a website called \"My Turn,\" through which residents can get notified once they are eligible for the vaccine. It will also track vaccination data and automatically report information into state data systems. Health officials hope this will reduce data lags and provide real-time information on the vaccination process.The overall vaccine supply into California will continue to be dictated by the federal government, state health officials noted. Last week, state epidemiologist Dr. Erica Pan said that it may take four to five months to get all California residents 65 years of age and older vaccinated at the current rate the state is receiving its doses of the coronavirus vaccine. Newsom on Monday said the state has tripled its rate of administration of the vaccine.More than 3.2 million people in the state have contracted the virus, and hospitals, especially in Southern California, have been overwhelmed. In that area, ICU capacity remains at 0%. CNN's Theresa Waldrop contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Donald Trump ends his tumultuous presidency with the nation confronting the greatest strain to its fundamental cohesion since the Civil War. The January 6 assault on the US Capitol capped four years in which Trump relentlessly stoked the nation's divisions and simultaneously provided oxygen for the growth of White nationalist extremism through his open embrace of racist language and conspiracy theories. In the process, Trump has not only shattered the barriers between the Republican Party and far-right extremists but also enormously intensified a trend that predated him: a growing willingness inside the GOP's mainstream to employ anti-small-d-democratic means to maintain power in a country demographically evolving away from the party. The result has been to raise the stakes in the ideological polarization of the parties that has been reshaping American politics for decades. In this January 6, 2021, photo, supporters listen as Trump speaks at a rally in Washington that preceded the deadly assault on the US Capitol.Particularly since the 1990s, the parties have steadily pulled apart, with Republicans rallying the voters who are most uneasy with the way America is changing demographically, culturally and economically and Democrats mobilizing those most comfortable with the changes. Read MoreThe Trump presidency, especially its chaotic final months, has shown that both the leaders and rank-and-file voters of the parties are now divided not only by their policy preferences but also by their assessments of the nation's underlying realities, and even their commitment to the traditional norms of democracy. In one sense, the two parties are moving away from each other in mirror image: Vast majorities of voters in each party now say in polls that they view the other side as a threat to the nation's future. But that assessment is provoking a more extreme reaction inside the GOP than among Democrats, as different elements of the Republican coalition have embraced a succession of anti-democratic actions culminating in the widespread support among GOP elected officials for Trump's efforts to subvert the November election and in last week's unprecedented assault on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob. False fraud claims fanned Capitol riot. Now they're fueling GOP efforts to restrict voting.All of this is unfolding against the backdrop of a pandemic that has staggered the economy, plunged millions of families into financial peril, overwhelmed America's health care system and widened the nation's political divisions -- as Republican-leaning jurisdictions, partly because of pressure from Trump, have resisted the measures, like masking, that public health professionals consider crucial. Coalescing at the transition point between the presidencies of Donald Trump and Joe Biden, these pressures have produced a level of internal division and cracks in the constitutional order that most experts agree exceeds even the unrest of the 1960s -- and probably has only one full parallel in American history. \"It is pretty clear that this is the worst since the Civil War, and I say that without difficulty,\" says Princeton University historian Sean Wilentz, the author of \"The Rise of American Democracy,\" a monumental history of America's development in the 19th century. \"And on top of that, what happened on the 6th was the saddest day for American democracy since April 12, 1861.\" That was the day Confederate troops fired on Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, beginning the Civil War.The great sorting outFew experts anticipate a reprise of that experience: a formal attempt at dissolving the nation accompanied by widespread armed conflict (even if they aren't quite as quick to dismiss the possibility as a few years ago). For one thing, today's lines of political conflict wouldn't allow as neat a division as the sectional North-South split over slavery in the Civil War: Our modern Mason-Dixon line separates Democratic-leaning metropolitan centers from red rural and small-town areas in every state, an impractical pattern for any actual separation. Susan Stokes, a political scientist who directs the Chicago Center on Democracy at the University of Chicago, notes that civil wars typically also require a split in the armed forces or the emergence of a full-scale rebel army, dynamics not yet evident in America. And Stokes, Wilentz and others point out that, for all of the pressure Trump imposed, the November 3 election and its aftermath demonstrated enormous resiliency in our political system, with voter turnout soaring to a record level despite the pandemic and courts and local election officials -- including Republicans in each case -- rejecting the President's groundless claims of fraud. \"Let's not forget we had the largest national election in American history amid the pandemic and it went off without a hitch,\" says Wilentz. \"November 3 was a day that will not in infamy but will live in fame for the exercise of democracy, and we ought not to forget that. There's a lot of strength in the system.\"I think we are a long way from choose your outright civil war: We're not Yugoslavia; we're not Spain. But we are definitely in danger of a kind of a lower-level violence, decentralized because that's our country's middle name, constant outbreaks, for years to come.Susan Stokes, director, Chicago Center on Democracy, University of ChicagoTo most experts, all of these mitigating factors make it extremely unlikely that America will follow the path of modern countries that collapsed into full-on civil war, like Yugoslavia after communism, Spain before World War II or Latin American nations during the 1980s. But a few years ago, those comparisons would have been unthinkable, and raising them now, even to dismiss them, underscores the fractures in our political structure.\"I think we are a long way from choose your outright civil war: We're not Yugoslavia; we're not Spain,\" says Stokes. \"But we are definitely in danger of a kind of a lower-level violence, decentralized because that's our country's middle name, constant outbreaks, for years to come.\"These pressures emerge from the convergence of two tectonic developments in American politics, one long-gestating, the other more recent.The longer-term process is the ideological separation of the two parties, a process that I called \"the great sorting out\" in my 2007 book, \"The Second Civil War.\" For most of American history, our political parties have been ramshackle coalitions of disparate ideological views. But starting in the 1960s, and accelerating since the 1990s, conservatives (especially Southern evangelical Whites and Northern working-class Whites) have migrated out of the Democratic Party, while moderates and liberals (especially college-educated Whites and secular voters) have migrated out of the Republican coalition. This process has both encouraged -- and been accelerated by -- the development of overtly partisan media since the 1980s, which has allowed voters on each side to retreat from a shared set of understandings about the nation's condition. The rise of social media in this century has only intensified the withdrawal from shared experience.Trump moves to lift some Covid-19-related travel restrictions, but Biden plans to block the orderAll of this has narrowed the differences within each party's coalition but widened the distance between them. Both among elected officials and voters, a huge chasm now separates the parties on almost all major issues. The distance is especially foreboding on attitudes toward the big structural changes remaking American life, culturally, demographically and economically.Republicans now dominate among the voters who polls show are most uneasy about those changes -- particularly Whites who are non-urban, identify as evangelical Christians or lack college degrees. In recent polling by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute, a larger share of Republicans say Whites and Christians face significant discrimination than say the same about Blacks and Hispanics; more than three-fourths of Republicans say the values of Islam are incompatible with American values; three-fifths say American society punishes men just for acting like men; and nearly three-fifths agree with the harshly worded statement that \"immigrants are invading our country and replacing our cultural and ethnic background.\" Democrats in the poll were far less likely to agree with any of those propositions. That reflects the composition of their competing coalition, which revolves around the groups generally most comfortable with the emerging America: people of color, young people, secular adults who don't identify with any religious tradition, and college-educated White voters, particularly women.Growing political antagonismThis demographic divide has widened the geographic separation between the parties. The GOP has been virtually exiled from the fast-growing metro areas that are driving population growth and economic dynamism: While George H.W. Bush won 57 of the nation's 100 largest counties as recently as 1988, Trump carried just 9 of the 100 largest in November, struggling not only in heavily minority central cities but also in prosperous, well-educated inner suburbs. Simultaneously, the GOP has solidified its control of the nation's more uniformly White exurban, small-town and rural regions: While Bill Clinton won about half of the nation's counties in his 1992 and 1996 presidential wins, Biden carried only about one-sixth of American counties, even while comfortably winning the popular vote.In Congress, these hardening lines of division have made it much more difficult for presidents in either party to secure meaningful cooperation from the other; the parties now vote in lockstep against each other much more routinely than in earlier generations. At the grassroots level, this separation has seeded rising reciprocal antagonism. In the Public Religion Research Institute polling, about four-fifths of Democrats say the Republican Party has been taken over by racists, while a virtually identical share of Republicans say the Democratic Party has been taken over by socialists. Pew polling before the election found that an even higher percentage -- roughly 9-in-10 on each side -- said that if the other party's presidential candidate won in November, it would produce \"lasting harm\" to the nation.Trumps' snub of Bidens historic in its magnitudeThis is an unusually pitched level of political antagonism, and it has unquestionably made it more difficult for Washington to make progress on big problems. But as Wilentz notes, in a country as diverse as America, \"there are always tons of divisions.\" And while those divisions have contributed to dysfunction in Congress, they had not until recently raised real questions about America's underlying political stability. Those doubts have emerged only since the long-standing polarization of the parties has been reinforced by a more recent second factor: the increasing willingness of the Republican Party to employ extreme and anti-democratic tactics to maintain power.Trump White HouseTrump's 11th-hour pardons keep with tradition, even if those pardoned do notTrumps' snub of Bidens historic in its magnitudeCNN Investigates: How Trump allies stoked the flames ahead of Capitol riotMAP: Full presidential election results This pattern has gathered momentum for years but it's tremendously accelerated since Trump's emergence as the party's leader. Signposts of this shift have come steadily over the past decade: the wave of voter identification and other laws in Republican states making it tougher to vote after the GOP's gains in the 2010 election; the 2013 party-line Shelby County decision by Republican appointees on the Supreme Court to gut the Voting Rights Act; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's unprecedented machinations in 2016 to prevent then-President Barack Obama from appointing a Supreme Court justice who would have tipped the majority to liberals; and the congressional Republican acquiescence to Trump's regular threats to the rule of law, from openly extorting the government of Ukraine to manufacture dirt on Biden to attempting, for the first time in American history, to tilt the census results to the advantage of one party. The widespread Republican support for Trump's efforts to steal the election -- which persisted to the point of a majority of House Republicans voting to overturn the results even after the mob of his supporters ransacked the Capitol -- has placed a dramatic exclamation point on this retreat from democracy in the GOP, many experts agree.\"Fifty years from now when people read about [this era] they are not going to say there were two parties that were small-d democratic,\" says Stokes. \"They are going to say that this is a political party that was captured by autocrats, by not-democratic people.\"Desire to maintain power at all costsTo Stokes, the Republican focus on alleged fraud in the 2020 election \"is sort of a big distraction\" from the underlying change that's reshaping the party. While the mass of Trump followers might accept his allegations of fraud, she notes, those claims have been disproved so thoroughly it's hard to imagine that they are believed by many of the party leaders joining his efforts to overturn the election. And that points to a deeper, and darker, meaning for the post-election maneuvering among Republican senators, House members and state attorneys general to subvert the results. \"Pretty clearly they are not really democrats,\" she says, referring to believers in democracy, not the opposing political party. \"They are people who think they should win no matter what. I almost want to say to them: Why don't you have the courage of your convictions and explain to us why the United States should not be a democracy now? Because what they are really saying is that no matter what happens, Trump needs to stay in power.\"Biden TransitionAnalysis: What does Biden's diverse Cabinet mean for a divided countryBiden crafts inaugural address to unify a country in crisisBiden administration braces for new wave of migrants as it rolls out new immigration plansMAP: Full presidential election results These efforts have found widespread support among Republican voters, with three-fourths or more of them routinely telling pollsters they believe the election was stolen and a majority in last week's ABC/Washington Post survey saying GOP leaders should have done even more to try to overturn the result. Those attitudes bring to a point years of surveys showing a retreat from democratic values in a significant portion of the GOP base.In one recent Public Religion Research Institute study, for instance, nearly three-fifths of Republicans agreed that \"because things have gotten so far off track in this country, we need a leader who is willing to break some rules if that's what it takes to set things right.\" In another national survey organized by political scientist Larry Bartels, a majority of Republican voters agreed \"the traditional American way of life is disappearing so fast that we may have to use force to save it.\"Imagine if the Weathermen had had a caucus of 10 Democrats in the House who basically supported them and they in turn were allied with state Democratic parties all over the place, state legislators, etc., and so on. That would have been a political danger of a different order.\nTodd Gitlin, Columbia University sociologistMany analysts believe these attitudes are inextricably linked to the anxieties about demographic and cultural change evident among GOP voters in the polling by the Public Religion Research Institute and others: At its core, the fear of demographic eclipse is eroding the commitment to democracy among both leaders and followers in the Republican Party. As Bartels, now at Vanderbilt University, noted in his paper, \"The strongest predictor by far of these antidemocratic attitudes is ethnic antagonism\u2014especially concerns about the political power and claims on government resources of immigrants, African-Americans, and Latinos.\"Republicans have lost the popular vote in seven of the past eight presidential elections, something no party had done since the formation of the modern party system in 1828. And, according to calculations by Lee Drutman, a senior fellow at New America, a centrist think tank, if you allocate half of each state's population to each senator, GOP senators have represented a majority of the population only once in the past 40 years despite controlling the actual Senate majority about half of that time. (Today Republicans hold exactly half the Senate seats while representing only about 44% of the population, Drutman calculates.) The determination to continue exercising majority power while attracting support from only a minority of the population, many experts agree, is the force that has pushed Republicans to retreat step by step from small d-democratic traditions -- a trend raised to a visceral extreme by the literal assault on the Capitol, a core symbol of American democracy.In this July 22, 1968, file photo, Black Panthers march to a news conference in New York to protest at the trial of one of their members, Huey P Newton. Newton was later convicted of manslaughter in the death of an Oakland police officer.The widespread inroads into the GOP among the forces hostile to democratic traditions mark a key difference from the 1960s, another period of intense social discord. While America in that era also experienced enormous strain -- with massive protest movements, large-scale urban unrest and riots, and anti-war radicals who regularly set off bombs at military recruiting or corporate offices -- the radical elements on that continuum never achieved as much influence inside the Democratic Party as the Trump forces skeptical of democracy have established in the modern GOP. Columbia University sociologist Todd Gitlin, who participated in the student left during the 1960s and has written one of the definitive histories of the period, notes that while \"there were a lot of bombs, that's for sure,\" radicals such as the Weathermen group \"were never a threat\" to the nation's core institutions because they lacked any leverage within the political system.\"Imagine if the Weathermen had had a caucus of 10 Democrats in the House who basically supported them and they in turn were allied with state Democratic parties all over the place, state legislators, etc., and so on. That would have been a political danger of a different order,\" he says. Instead, he says, the Weathermen and other militant groups such as the Black Panthers \"were not politically central in the way that [today's extremists] are. There is now a party made up substantially of people who are either friendly toward violence ... or willing to look the other way. And nobody was willing to look the other way at those bombings.\"One party alone can't fix itThe closest American parallel to the violence unleased by Trump supporters at the Capitol -- and earlier threats like the armed protests against Covid restrictions and the subsequent plot to kidnap Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan -- may be the pro-slavery Democratic Party around the Civil War. Especially after the conflict, White racists across the South employed a massive campaign of violence to undermine the biracial Reconstruction governments and prevent the former slaves from exercising their new freedoms, including the right to vote. That bitter and bloody tradition lingered through nearly a full century of lynchings and other violence to deny the vote and civil rights to Blacks across the Jim Crow South -- all with the support of the Dixiecrat Southern Democrats.Seen against that history, the upsurge in White nationalist violence under Trump seems less like a new phenomenon than the resurgence of an old one -- a determination to use force to maintain a clear racial hierarchy. Political scientist Alvin Tillery, director of the Center for the Study of Diversity and Democracy at Northwestern University, says Trump's success at mobilizing an electoral coalition resistant to demographic change underscores the country's imperfect progress toward creating a true multiracial democracy. While America has formally been a democracy since its birth in the 1700s, he notes, for most of our history those democratic rights were limited solely to White men. In this May 14, 2020, file photo, protesters carrying weapons -- angry at Gov. Gretchen Whitmer for  stay-at-home orders related to the coronavirus -- gather at the Michigan Capitol in Lansing.Democracy, he says, is much easier to sustain when it's limited to \"a master race ... where your skin color or your gender determined your rights and your status.\" Only since the 1960s, with the passage of the Voting Rights Act and immigration revisions that led to a rapid growth in the nation's racial diversity, did \"we really start trying, with much great difficulty, to be a multiracial, gender-equitable LGBTQ-plus tolerant democracy. That's why we have these struggles.\"Few are willing to hazard definitive predictions about whether America will pull back from this brink and restore more stability to the political system -- or spiral further into conflict and division. Biden, who will assume the presidency Wednesday, appears to be betting primarily on a strategy of narrowing divisions by providing bread-and-butter improvements in people's daily lives: more vaccine shots in their arms, more Covid relief money in their pockets -- while stepping up law enforcement efforts against White nationalist groups.That approach might help contain the problem, but most experts agree it is unlikely to end it. While the inclination among Democrats may be \"let's just get to the bread-and-butter issue,\" says Tillery, \"that's not necessarily the motivation of the people that sacked the Capitol.\"Biden crafts inaugural address to unify a country in crisisIn the long run, whatever Biden and other Democrats do, the question of whether the US faces more violence and other threats to its fundamental political stability probably rests more with the choices that Republicans make. If the party continues to validate and welcome extremists at its fringe and move further toward adopting anti-democratic tactics in its mainstream, the nation could be locked into a cycle of rising disorder -- particularly because the growing racial and religious diversity that triggers so much of the alienation in the Republican coalition will only intensify in the years ahead. Wilentz notes there has always been a minority of Americans who embrace conspiracy theories, tolerate violence to advance their goals and are willing to ditch democracy to maintain power for their side. But for much of American history, their influence has been controlled because neither party would fully embrace their causes; that's the barrier that has cracked in the GOP, especially during the tempestuous Trump years.  \"That 35% has always been there, let alone the really crackpot 15%,\" Wilentz says. \"The point is they were contained because both parties respected each other and respected what political representative democracy was all about. The Republican Party forgot to do that. The Republican Party stopped doing that. And that is what unleashed this force.\"However hard Biden tries, history suggests that one party alone is unlikely to repair the widening domestic divisions that may stand as Trump's clearest legacy. It's likely that both parties will need to commit to undoing Trump's damage to America's political stability -- or that damage won't be undone at all.",

        "content": "(CNN)Washington, DC, and states across the country are heightening security and preparing reinforcements this week ahead of potential armed protests from Saturday up to at least Inauguration Day on Wednesday.One week after a pro-Trump mob ransacked the US Capitol, federal officials reiterated a warning in a call with law enforcement leaders across the country, saying they remain concerned about the prospect of extremists appearing at planned rallies and conducting violence.Security is also ramping up in battleground states that were crucial to President-elect Joe Biden's presidential victory, with governors activating the National Guard, closing capitols, erecting fences and barriers and, in at least two cases, boarding up windows. Feds warn extremists may be emboldened to carry out additional attacks after Capitol insurrectionFBI Director Christopher Wray said Thursday that authorities are \"tracking calls for potential armed protests and activity leading up to the inauguration.\"\"We're monitoring all incoming leads -- whether calls for armed protests, potential threats that grow out of the January 6th breach of the Capitol, or other kinds of potential threats leading up to inaugural events and various other targets,\" Wray said. Read MoreIt all adds up to an inauguration unlike any other, with no crowds in DC and security to the maximum across the country.How DC is preparingA week after the US Capitol riot, the area around Capitol Hill is under strict security. Members of the National Guard were present all around, including inside the Capitol, and new fencing blocked off the perimeter of the area.DC Police Chief Robert Contee said Wednesday that more than 20,000 National Guard members could be expected in the district for Biden's inauguration, though he noted the final numbers will be provided by the US Secret Service.Hundreds of National Guard soldiers have been deployed to reinforce security at the US Capitol ahead of Inauguration Day.The officials added that there is no concern that there will be any shortage of Guard forces to meet requirements from states and the District of Columbia.Contee told reporters he remains concerned amid a \"major security threat\" ahead of the inauguration and planned demonstrations in the district this weekend.\"I've been concerned before today and will be through this weekend, and beyond,\" Contee said on Wednesday.He also praised DC Mayor Muriel Bowser's security posture, including discouraging people from coming to Washington for the inauguration.\"There's a major security threat, and we are working to mitigate those threats,\" he added.Pelosi announces retired Lt. Gen. Russel Honor\u00e9 to lead review of 'security infrastructure' after Capitol attackThe National Mall will be closed to the general public on Inauguration Day due to security concerns, the National Park Service (NPS) announced Friday.The temporary public closure began Friday morning and will extend through at least Thursday, January 21. The NPS says protests will be allowed in designated locations and will be limited to those with permits.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Friday that retired Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honor\u00e9 will lead a review of security infrastructure, interagency processes and command and control operations on Capitol Hill.How states are preparingStates across the country are enhancing security and calling up the National Guard to protect capitols ahead of the possible protests, including in California, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.Florida and Maine have also activated the National Guard to work with state law enforcement.Georgia state troopers stand guard outside the Georgia Capitol in downtown Atlanta on the first day of the 2021 legislative session on Monday, January 11.A number of states are deploying heavy fencing and additional crowd control measures around their capitols, including in Arizona, California, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Virginia and Washington, while Pennsylvania has built barriers and increased security.Although many capitols are closed due to coronavirus restrictions, the warnings are particularly fraught in states that allow people to openly carry firearms and those where Trump has falsely claimed fraud.Kentucky and Texas went steps further Friday, announcing that the grounds around the state Capitols will be closed temporarily. The Texas Capitol complex will close from Saturday through Wednesday, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety.The department's director said the agency is aware of armed protests planned at the Texas State Capitol this week and \"violent extremists who may seek to exploit constitutionally protected events to conduct criminal acts.\"Director Steven McCraw said the agency has deployed additional personnel and resources to the Capitol.Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, said he understands the state's move to close the Capitol grounds on Sunday will inconvenience some people.\"We appreciate everyone's understanding and your patriotism,\" he said.How key states plan to secure their capitol buildings ahead of possible armed pro-Trump protestsIn Michigan, where heavily armed demonstrators jammed inside the state Capitol in Lansing in the spring, the open carry of firearms was banned inside the building. Still, Lansing's mayor has asked the governor to call up the National Guard to protect the Capitol, and the state attorney general said that the state's new open-carry firearms ban there is not enough.The Michigan State Police is mobilizing personnel from across the state to secure the Capitol ahead of planned protests, including one on Sunday, the agency said in a statement Friday.Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel told CNN that the actions of law enforcement and the open-carry ban have assuaged his fears for now. \"Hopefully, the temperature of the country comes down a little bit after Trump is no longer in the White House and Joe Biden has been officially inaugurated,\" she said. \"But I think it's going to be a day-by-day process to see what the threat level is.\"The state Senate and House have canceled legislative sessions around Inauguration Day over concerns of \"credible threats.\"In Virginia, a state of emergency has been declared in Richmond and Capitol Square will be closed ahead of anticipated protests at the state Capitol. The state is anticipating a gathering Monday for \"Lobby Day,\" an annual protest event that last year brought thousands of gun rights advocates to the Capitol.Governors in Maryland, New Mexico and Utah also declared states of emergency.In Oregon, the FBI has set up a command post to gather and share intelligence with law enforcement on potential threats of violence to the state Capitol.'That's like putting gasoline on a fire.' Some states are more vulnerable to unrest than othersIn Florida and Oklahoma, lawmakers and staff are being told to work from home this weekend due to the likelihood of protests. Pennsylvania and Utah are closing their capitols altogether. The first-floor windows of the state capitols in Illinois, Michigan, Virginia and Wisconsin have been boarded up  ahead of potential protests. New Jersey has told state employees to work from home on Inauguration Day.Several large states are on high alert. In New York, state police have taken steps \"to harden security in and around the State Capitol in Albany\" ahead of Biden's inauguration.

        "content": "(CNN)A US Capitol police officer is the latest to be confirmed dead after a mob of President Trump's supporters stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday. Four other people died during the stunning attack at the heart of American democracy as mob members vandalized the building and assaulted police officers. One woman was fatally shot by police and three people died of apparent medical emergencies.Several DC Metropolitan Police officers were also injured during the insurrection, police Chief Robert Contee said. One officer had significant facial injuries from being struck by a projectile, and another officer was hospitalized after being pepper-sprayed.Here's what we know about the people who died:Officer dies after being injuredRead MoreCapitol Police released a statement saying Officer Brian D. Sicknick passed away Thursday night \"due to injuries sustained while on-duty.\" Officer Sicknick was injured while physically engaging with the rioters and collapsed after returning to his division office. \"He was taken to a local hospital where he succumbed to his injuries,\" the Capitol Police statement said.Officer Sicknick joined the USCP in July 2008, and most recently served in the Department's First Responder's Unit.  \"The entire USCP Department expresses its deepest sympathies to Officer Sicknick's family and friends on their loss, and mourns the loss of a friend and colleague,\" Capitol Police added. His death is now being investigated. United States Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick Sicknick was originally from South River, New Jersey, and the youngest of three sons, according to a statement issued by his brother on behalf of his family. Sicknick \"wanted to be a police officer his entire life,\" his brother Ken said, and joined the New Jersey National Guard in his pursuit of that goal.According to a statement from New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy's office, Sicknick was a staff sergeant for the New Jersey National Guard. He served as a fire team member and a leader of the 108th Security Force Squadron, 108th Wing, at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, Murphy's statement said. Sicknick's service included two deployments -- one as part of Operation Southern Watch and another as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, Murphy said. Sicknick's family was \"very proud\" of his service to his country, Ken Sicknick said. \"Brian is a hero, and that is what we would like people to remember,\" he said.Air Force veteran fatally shot by policeA woman was fatally shot by a US Capitol Police employee as the mob tried to force its way toward the House Chamber where members of Congress were sheltering, US Capitol Police said in a statement.The woman was given medical assistance immediately and taken to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead.Authorities identified her as Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old from Huntington, Maryland. Babbit's mother, Michelle Witthoeft told CNN on Thursday she was devastated to learn of her daughter's death.\"I loved and admired her greatly,\" Witthoeft said of Babbitt. \"She served this country boldly and proudly.\"Babbitt was an ardent Trump supporter who held strong political views, her mother said, and was \"passionate enough to die for what she believed in.\"Babbitt, who was previously married but separated from her husband in 2019, frequently attended pro-Trump rallies. She flew to Washington, DC, from San Diego, California, with the intent to participate in the protest this week, her mother said.\"Her political views were strong and adamant, and she voiced them whenever she could,\" Witthoeft said.

She also shared content promoting political conspiracy theories often pushed by far-right figures.Babbitt served as a senior airman in the US Air Force from 2004 to 2008 under the name Ashli Elizabeth McEntee, according to military records. She was a member of the Air Force Reserve from 2008 to 2010 and was in the Air National Guard from 2010 until November 2016, records show.\"She served in the United States Air Force and was deployed four times and came back safely, only to have her own country shoot her down,\" Witthoeft said tearfully by phone.The US Capitol Police employee who shot Babbitt has been placed on administrative leave and their police powers have been suspended pending a joint Metro Police and USCP investigation, USCP said. US Capitol secured, 4 dead after rioters stormed the halls of Congress to block Biden's win\"This is a tragic incident, and I send my condolences to the victim's family and friends,\" Metro Police Chief Contee said.Two people who saw the shooting, left-wing activist John Sullivan and documentary filmmaker Jade Sacker, provided CNN with video of the incident and described the moments beforehand.Sullivan said rioters were using flag poles and other items to smash glass windows inside the Capitol. The woman then tried to make her way through the window when several people with guns came out through the doorways.\"The second that she climbed through the window she got shot right in the neck area, fell backwards,\" Sullivan said in an interview that broadcast on CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360.\" \"I just remember the sense of shock and sorrow that somebody just died and did not need to die.\"The woman was trying to enter an area that did not yet appear to have been breached by rioters, Sullivan said.\"It was an area that was completely blocked off,\" he said. \"They had chairs up against the doorway, tables, so people couldn't get in.\"Three others deadThree other people who had come from out of state died of \"medical emergencies\" during the riot, police said.\"One adult female and two adult males appear to have suffered from separate medical emergencies, which resulted in their deaths,\" Contee said. \"Any loss of life in the District is tragic and our thoughts are with anyone impacted by their loss.\"They were identified as Benjamin Philips, 50, of Ringtown, Pennsylvania; Kevin Greeson, 55, of Athens, Alabama; and Rosanne Boyland, 34, of Kennesaw, Georgia. The three were on the grounds of the Capitol when they experienced their medical emergencies, Contee said.Kevin GreesonGreeson had a history of high blood pressure and suffered a heart attack amid the excitement, his family said in a statement to CNN. He was an advocate of Trump and attended the event to show his support. \"He was excited to be there to experience this event,\" the statement said. \"He was not there to participate in violence or rioting, nor did he condone such actions.\"The family says they are devastated by the loss. \"Kevin was a wonderful father and husband who loved life,\" the family statement said. \"He loved to ride motorcycles, he loved his job and his coworkers, and he loved his dogs.\"Boyland's family is also mourning her death, her brother-in-law, Justin Cave, told CNN affiliate WGCL. The family is still working to learn more details about the specifics of her death, he said.As the family watched Wednesday's events, they hoped that Boyland wasn't among the crowd, Cave said. \"Tragically she was there and it cost her life,\" he said.\"She was a wonderful sister, daughter, and aunt. Anyone who knew her knows how compassionate she was, she always put others before herself,\" Cave said. DC Fire and Emergency Medical Services transported people to area hospitals with injuries ranging from cardiac arrest to multiple fractures after falling from scaffolding on the West front of the Capitol building.However, city officials did not say whether any of these people are the ones who died.Correction: Earlier versions of this article misspelled the last name of Benjamin Philips.CNN's Kelsie Smith, Oren Liebermann, Adrienne Winston, Kara Scannell, Alex Marquardt, Aileen Graef and Mary Kay Mallonee contributed to this report.",

        "content": "This story contains images and descriptions of extremist groups and their beliefs.   (CNN)Flags, signs and symbols of racist, white supremacist and extremist groups were displayed along with Trump 2020 banners and American flags at Wednesday's riot at the US Capitol. The pictures tell part of the story of the beliefs of some of those who chose to show up on that day -- from passionate and peaceful Trump supporters to extremists who showed their hate with their symbols as well as their actions.  The mixing of the groups is one issue that experts who track extremism and hate have long been concerned about.  The certification of the election results proved to be exactly the type of event that brought together various groups and could have led to radical ideas being shared, they say. The initial event, which was heavily promoted and encouraged by President Trump, gave all of these groups something to rally around.   \"This was an event designed to oppose the results of a free and fair democratic election and the transition of power that would naturally follow,\" Mark Pitcavage, a historian and expert in extremism with the Anti-Defamation League said.  Read MoreCNN spoke with him to identify the symbols and understand the chilling messages of tyranny, white supremacy, anarchy, racism, anti-Semitism and hatred they portray.  Noose and gallows While a noose on its own is often used as a form of racial intimidation, Pitcavage says he believes in this context the gallows were to suggest punishment for committing treason. \"It is suggesting that representatives and senators who vote to certify the election results, and possibly Vice President Pence, are committing treason and should be tried and hanged,\" he explains. That treason rhetoric was seen on right-wing message boards in days leading up to the event. Three Percenters flag The Three Percenters (also known as III%ers, 3%ers or Threepers) are part of the militia movement in the United States and are anti-government extremists, according to the ADL.  Like others in the militia movement, Three Percenters view themselves as defending the American people against government tyranny.    \"Because many adherents to the militia movement strongly support President Trump, in recent years, Three Percenters have not been as active in opposing the federal government, directing their ire at other perceived foes, including leftists/antifa, Muslims and immigrants,\" according to the ADL. The group's name comes from an inaccurate claim that only three percent of the people in the colonies armed themselves and fought against the British during the Revolutionary War. The flag seen above is their logo on the traditional Betsy Ross flag. Pitcavage says right-wing groups (mainstream or extreme), which think of themselves as patriotic, sometimes co-opt America's first flag. \"Release the Kraken\" flag The flag references former Trump lawyer Sidney Powell's comments that she was going to \"release the Kraken.\" Powell falsely said she had evidence that would destroy the idea that Joe Biden won the presidency.  The \"Kraken,\"  a mammoth sea creature from Scandavian folklore, has turned into a meme in circles that believe the election was stolen. The Kraken, they say, is a cache of evidence that there was widespread fraud. On social media, QAnon conspiracy and fringe sites #ReleaseTheKraken has been widely shared along with false theories of fraud.  The Proud Boys and the OK sign The far right has co-opted the OK sign as a trolling gesture and, for some, as a symbol of white power. The ADL added that symbol to\u202fits long-standing database\u202fof slogans and symbols used by extremists.A photo from the riot at the US Capitol shows several people making the OK hand gesture.Some of the people in the photo are also seen in a livestream from the rally, where they identify themselves as members of the Proud Boys, specifically the Arizona chapter.The man livestreaming the event moves through the crowd at the Capitol saying \"support your local Proud Boys.\"In the video, he goes up to a group wearing orange hats and says, \"They wanna know what the orange hats stand for.\"One man replies that it's a way to keep their group together before another chimes in: \"It stands for the best fcking chapter in the best fcking organization in the world.\" Asked what that organization is, the man in an orange hat declares: \"The Proud Boys.\" The Proud Boys has been supportive of President Trump and present in large numbers at \"Stop The Steal\" rallies in Washington, DC. The Proud Boys' leader, Henry Tarrio, who goes by Enrique Tarrio, was released from police custody Tuesday on\u202fcharges related to allegedly burning a Black Lives Matter banner taken from a Black church last month during protests in the city after a \"Stop the Steal\" event. Tarrio has admitted to CNN he did burn the banner.  He was ordered by a local judge to stay out of DC as he awaits trial, including during this week's protests.\"Kekistan\" flags The green, white and black flag was created by some members of the 4chan online community to represent a made-up joke country named for \"Kek,\"  a fictional god they also created. It has long been present at right-wing and far-right rallies.  \"The Kekistan flag is controversial because its design was partially derived from a Nazi-era flag; this was apparently done on purpose as a joke,\" Pitcavage explained. \"Younger right-wingers coming from the 4chan subculture (both mainstream right and extreme right) often like to display the Kekistan flag at rallies and events.\" Altered historic flags Altered Confederate and Gadsden flags were seen throughout the crowds at the Capitol.  One Confederate battle flag variation included an image of assault rifle and the slogan \"Come and take it\" to convey an anti-gun control message. The phrase \"come and take it\" paraphrases the \"come and take them\" retort uttered by Spartan King Leonidas at the Battle of Thermopylae when the Persian King Xerxes told him and his people to lay down their spears in return for their lives, Pitcavage said.   The Gadsden flag, which is known to many as the \"Don't Tread on Me\" flag, is a traditional and historical patriotic flag dating to the American Revolution. The flag and symbol are also popular among Libertarians.  But it also has been co-opted by right wing groups. Pitcavage explains that while some fly it as a symbol for patriotism, others use it as a \"symbol of resistance to perceived tyranny.\"  Oath Keepers A man is seen wearing an Oath Keepers hat inside the Capitol after it was breached. The Oath Keepers is a pro-Trump, far-right, anti-government group that considers itself part of the militia movement charged to protect the country and defend the constitution. The group tries to recruit members from among active or retired military, first responders, or police. Their leader has spouted vast conspiracy theories on his blog, accused Democrats of stealing the election, previously threatened violence if it was necessary on Election Day during an interview with far-right conspiracist Alex Jones and said his group would be armed to protect the White House if necessary, according to the ADL. The Confederate flag  During the United States' long Civil War, no Confederate battle flag came within the shadow of the US Capitol, but on Wednesday, an insurrectionist carried one right through its halls. Photographers captured a man carrying it past the portraits of abolitionist Charles Sumner and\u202fslaveholder John Calhoun. The flag was always a symbol of support for slavery. After World War II, it became a prominent symbol of Jim Crow and segregation, Pitcavage says not surprisingly, it is a popular symbol among white supremacists -- even outside the United States. America First flag A rioter cloaks himself in an America First flag with the logo of the podcast by far-right commentator Nick Fuentes. Fuentes attended the event at the Capitol, but was photographed remaining outside the Capitol building. \"America First\" was also a slogan President Trump used in describing his foreign policy. Its adoption was criticized by the ADL, which said it had an anti-Semitic use seeking to keep the US out of World War II.  The ADL says Fuentes is part of the \"groyper army,\" which the ADL calls a white supremacist group. \"While the group and leadership's views align with those held by the white supremacist alt right, groypers attempt to normalize their ideology by aligning themselves with 'Christianity' and 'traditional' values ostensibly championed by the church, including marriage and family,\" the ADL explains. \"Like the alt right and other white supremacists, groypers believe they are working to defend against demographic and cultural changes that are destroying the 'true America' -- a white, Christian nation.\"  \"Camp Auschwitz\"  A rioter inside the Capitol wore a \"Camp Auschwitz\" sweatshirt. The bottom of the shirt reads \"Work brings freedom,\" which is the rough translation of the words \"Arbeit\u202fmacht frei\" on the gates of the Nazi concentration camp. Auschwitz was the largest and most infamous Nazi concentration camp, where about 1.1 million people were killed during World War II. Pitcavage says he believes the shirt came from the now-defunct website Aryanwear. The design, which has been around for about 10 years according to Pitcavage, has been popping up on differing websites in recent weeks, though it is often taken down when a complaint is made.  Nationalist Social Club stickers A social media image shows Nationalist Social Club stickers on what appears to be US Capitol Police equipment  It's unclear when the photo was taken, but it was posted Wednesday in a Telegram chat the group uses, which includes a Nazi symbol as part of their name. NSC, apparently a word play on the National Socialists or Nazi party, is a neo-Nazi group that has regional chapters in both the United States and across the globe, according to the ADL. It is unclear if the sticker on the right refers to a New England chapter, or because the group originally called itself the New England Nationalists Club.\"NSC members see themselves as soldiers at war with a hostile, Jewish-controlled system that is deliberately plotting the extinction of the white race,\" according to the ADL. \"Their goal is to form an underground network of white men who are willing to fight against their perceived enemies through localized direct actions.\"  MAGA Civil War January 6, 2021 shirts There are still many questions about how exactly the attack on the Capitol happened and who led the charge. But the calls for overthrowing the government and for a civil or race war have long been rallying cries in far-right circles.  The shirts worn by these men on the Capitol grounds on Wednesday show there was at least an intention to commemorate the day. They wore pre-printed shirts, referencing Trump's signature Make America Great Again slogan, alongside the words Civil war and the date of the event that turned into insurrection.  Many commenters in far-right forums have written since the attack, that this is just the beginning of that civil war that many of them have long desired.

        "content": "(CNN)The US Capitol is once again secured but four people are dead -- including one woman who was shot -- after supporters of President Donald Trump breached one of the most iconic American buildings, engulfing the nation's capital in chaos after Trump urged his supporters to fight against the ceremonial counting of the electoral votes that will confirm President-elect Joe Biden's win.Shortly after 1 p.m. ET Wednesday hundreds of pro-Trump protesters pushed through barriers set up along the perimeter of the Capitol, where they tussled with officers in full riot gear, some calling the officers \"traitors\" for doing their jobs. About 90 minutes later, police said demonstrators got into the building and the doors to the House and Senate were being locked. Shortly after, the House floor was evacuated by police. Vice President Mike Pence was also evacuated from the chamber, where he was to perform his role in the counting of electoral votes.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)An armed standoff took place at the House front door at about 3 p.m. ET, and police officers had their guns drawn at someone who was trying to breach it. A Trump supporter was also pictured standing at the Senate dais earlier in the afternoon. A woman, who is yet to be identified, died after being shot in the chest on the Capitol grounds, DC police confirmed to CNN. More information on the shooting was not immediately available and a police spokesperson said additional details will come later. DC Police Chief Robert Contee said three other people died from medical emergencies during the riot.\"One adult female and two adult males appear to have suffered from separate medical emergencies, which resulted in their deaths. Any loss of life in the District is tragic and our thoughts are with anyone impacted by their loss,\" Contee said at a news conference Wednesday night.Read MoreMultiple officers have been injured with at least one transported to the hospital, multiple sources tell CNN.Smoke grenades were used on the Senate side of the Capitol, as police worked to clear the building of rioters. Windows on the west side of the Senate were broken, and hundreds of officers amassed on the first floor of the building. The Senate floor was cleared of rioters as of 3:30 p.m. ET, and an officer told CNN that they successfully squeezed them away from the Senate wing of the building and toward the Rotunda. The protesters were removed through the east and west doors of the Capitol. At least 52 people were arrested as of 9:30 p.m. ET Wednesday in Washington.The US Capitol Police worked to secure the second floor of the Capitol first, and were seen just before 5 p.m. ET pushing demonstrators off the steps on the east side of the building. With about 30 minutes to go before Washington's 6 p.m. ET curfew, Washington police amassed in a long line to push the mob back from the Capitol grounds.It took until roughly 5:40 p.m. ET for the building to once again be secured, according to the sergeant-at-arms.The stunning display of insurrection was the first time the US Capitol had been overrun since the British attacked and burned the building in August of 1814, during the War of 1812, according to Samuel Holliday, director of scholarship and operations with the US Capitol Historical Society.The shocking scene was met with less police force than many of the Black Lives Matter protests that rolled across the country in the wake of George Floyd's killing at the hands of Minneapolis police officers last year. While federal police attacked peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square outside the White House over the summer, clearing the way for Trump to take a photo in front of a nearby church at the time, protesters on Wednesday were able to overrun Capitol police and infiltrate the country's legislative chambers.     An afternoon of chaosThe protesters first breached exterior security barriers, and video footage showed protesters gathering and some clashing with police near the Capitol building. CNN's team on the ground saw a number of protesters trying to move up the side of the Capitol building. Several loud flash bangs were heard as well.Protesters could be seen pushing against metal fences and police used the fences to push protesters back, while other officers reached over the top to club people trying to cross their lines. Flash bangs could be heard near the steps of the Capitol as smoke filled the air. In some instances officers could be seen deploying pepper spray. Tear gas was deployed, but it's not clear whether by protesters or police, and people wiped tears from their eyes while coughing.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)After the building was breached, the Capitol police officer in the House chamber told lawmakers that they may need to duck under their chairs and informed lawmakers that protesters were in the building's Rotunda. Lots of House members were seen wearing gas masks as they moved between Capitol buildings. Members were calling family to say they were OK.

As Congress prepares to affirm President-elect Joe Biden's victory, thousands of people have gathered to show their support for President Donald Trump and his claims of election fraud.(AP Photo/John Minchillo)Congressional leaders were being evacuated from the Capitol complex just before 5 p.m. ET and were set to be taken to Fort McNair, a nearby Army base in Washington, according to a federal law enforcement official. Trump has directed the National Guard to Washington along with \"other federal protective services,\" according to White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. The entire DC National Guard has been activated by the Department of Defense, according to the Pentagon.\"The D.C. Guard has been mobilized to provide support to federal law enforcement in the District,\" said Jonathan Hoffman, the chief Pentagon spokesman. \"Acting Secretary Miller has been in contact with Congressional leadership, and Secretary McCarthy has been working with the D.C. government. The law enforcement response will be led by the Department of Justice.\"WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 06: Pro-Trump supporters storm the U.S. Capitol following a rally with President Donald Trump on January 6, 2021 in Washington, DC.

(Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images)The official said DC National Guard was not anticipating to be used to protect federal facilities, and the Trump administration had decided earlier this week that would be the task of civilian law enforcement, the official said. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a citywide curfew from 6 p.m. ET on Wednesday until 6 a.m. ET Thursday.Lawmakers return to the CapitolLawmakers began returning to the Capitol after the building was secured and made it clear that they intended to resume their intended business -- namely, confirming Biden's win over Trump by counting the votes in the Electoral College.Proceedings resumed at about 8 p.m. ET with Pence -- who never left the Capitol, according to his press secretary -- bringing the Senate session back into order.\"Let's get back to work,\" he said.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement earlier Wednesday evening that congressional leadership wanted to continue with the joint session Wednesday night.\"Today, a shameful assault was made on our democracy. It was anointed at the highest level of government. It cannot, however, deter us from our responsibility to validate the election of Joe Biden,\" Pelosi wrote.\"To that end, in consultation with Leader Hoyer and Whip Clyburn and after calls to the Pentagon, the Justice Department and the Vice President, we have decided we should proceed tonight at the Capitol once it is cleared for use. Leader Hoyer will be sending out more guidance later today.\"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the floor that the \"United States Senate will not be intimidated. We will not be kept out of this chamber by thugs, mobs or threats.\" It took until deep in the early hours of Thursday morning, but Congress eventually counted and certified Biden's election win.Trump tells supporters to go home, eventuallyTrump finally called on his supporters to \"go home\" hours after the riot started, but spent a large amount of time in the one-minute video lamenting and lying about his election loss. In one stunning line, Trump told the mob to \"go home,\" but added, \"We love you. You are very special.\"Trump struck a sympathetic tone to the rioters he himself unleashed, saying, \"I know your pain, I know you're hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election and everyone knows it. Especially the other side. But you have to go home now. We have to have peace.\"However, later on in the evening Trump justified the mob's actions and praised them.\"These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!\" he said, in a tweet that was later deleted by Twitter. Others inside the President's orbit tweeted their calls for calm as the mob repeatedly attempted to take over the building.Donald Trump Jr., the President's son, said that his supporters who mobbed the Capitol were \"wrong and not who we are.\"\"Be peaceful and use your 1st Amendment rights, but don't start acting like the other side. We have a country to save and this doesn't help anyone,\" he tweeted.Multiple bombs detonated safelyFederal and local law enforcement responded to reports of possible pipe bombs in multiple locations in Washington, DC, according to a federal law enforcement official.Supporters of US President Donald Trump enter the US Capitol's Rotunda on January 6, 2021, in Washington, DC. - Demonstrators breeched security and entered the Capitol as Congress debated the a 2020 presidential election Electoral Vote Certification. (Photo by Saul LOEB / AFP) (Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)A pipe bomb was found at the Republican National Committee's headquarters, a RNC official told CNN. The device was found on the ground outside, along the wall of the headquarters. It was safely detonated by the police, the RNC official said.At least two suspected pipe bombs were rendered safe by law enforcement -- the one at the building that houses RNC offices and one in the US Capitol complex, a federal law enforcement official told CNN. The official said these were real explosive devices and they were detonated safely.The Democratic National Committee was also evacuated after a suspicious package was being investigated nearby, a Democratic source familiar with the matter told CNN. The party had preemptively closed the building ahead of the protests, the source said, but a few security and essential personnel were evacuated.Near the scene where one of the pipe bombs was found Wednesday, police detained a suspect and found a vehicle with a rifle and as many as 10 Molotov cocktails, according to a federal law enforcement official. Investigators are working to determine whether there's a connection to the bombs found earlier.

        "content": "(CNN)The George Floyd police brutality protests are different -- bigger, fiercer, more sustained -- than demonstrations prior.America rises up regularly. It's in the DNA of a country founded on dissent. Millions have forged their anger into action, from the tax revolts of the nation's earliest days, to the labor, housing and busing protests that helped shape the civil rights movement. The Me Too-fueled women's marches of 2017 and 2018 and the March for Our Lives demonstration, born of the Parkland school shooting, each drew a seven-figure attendance.Before Floyd's killing, the highest estimate for any American protest -- the 2017 Women's March -- was 4.6 million. Polls indicate that, as of mid-June, as many as 21 million adults had attended a Black Lives Matter or police brutality protest. They continue today, more than 10 weeks after a Minneapolis policeman knelt on Floyd's neck till the life left his body.It's not just people and protests, though. It's also policies and points of view.\"I never would've imagined I would see a day when the Washington football team would change its name,\" said Tyran Steward, assistant history professor at Williams College, noting demands once deemed nonstarters are now on the table.Read MoreThe Women's March of 2017 drew millions to the streets of Boston and other American cities. Police accountability bills have been introduced in Congress. Americans are discussing what defunding law enforcement actually means. Corporations are recognizing Juneteenth. Mississippi is changing its flag. Tributes to Confederates and others who espoused hate are falling. Athletes kneeling during the National Anthem aren't seen as so un-American anymore.Why now? People demanded change after Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, after Freddie Gray in Baltimore, after Walter Scott and the Mother Emanuel massacre in South Carolina.Publisher and former St. Louis Alderman Antonio French, a staple of 2014's Ferguson protests, oversees coverage of the ongoing unrest in his city. Nationally, there are \"daily reminders of why they need to be out in the streets protesting and demanding change,\" and he's proud they've been overwhelmingly peaceful, he said, but don't take it for granted.\"What started in 2014 in the streets of Ferguson has just spread across the country,\" he said. \"Having this kind of turmoil with that many unemployed young people, with this kind of national leadership that has zero empathy ... this is the makings of real conflict, and I think we should be really concerned.\"The reaction to Floyd's killing has indeed been different, experts say, owing to the graphic nature of the video that captured it, the nation's calls for justice in other killings, a pandemic disrupting normality, widespread unemployment, a phenomenon known as \"vicarious trauma\" and White people joining people of color in the streets. 'Interest convergence'Covid-19 plays a dual role in the protests' momentum, scholars say. The pandemic has kept people home, with more time to consume news of Floyd's fatal arrest and the ensuing unrest. The pandemic has also robbed Americans of popular escapes, such as bars, movie theaters and vacations.Coronavirus also exposed the interconnectedness of human vulnerability, which provides a new lens through which Whites can view Floyd's killing, said Emory University philosophy professor George Yancy.\"It has unveiled the way in which we are all interrelated and haptic. There's a way all of our bodies are touching through Covid,\" he said.It's not a new concept. Poet John Donne wrote in 1624, \"Any man's death diminishes me because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.\" The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said man is \"tied in a single garment of destiny,\" and what affects one affects all. Yancy and Steward also cited legal scholar Derrick Bell, whose theory of \"interest convergence\" posited African American advances are reliant on the dominant culture.JUST WATCHEDSee George Floyd hologram light up Confederate monumentReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSee George Floyd hologram light up Confederate monument 00:53\"The only way in which Black people will have success or the same level of equity is their interests have to converge with White interests,\" Yancy said. \"It's not genuine equity. It conforms to the interests of White people.\"Some of history's most monumental advances for African Americans didn't emerge from a sense of justice or what's right, the scholars say, but because of White leaders' ulterior motives. The government didn't file its amicus brief in Brown v. Board of Education because desegregating schools meant better education for Blacks. Instead, discrimination jeopardized America's \"moral leadership\" and its commitment to democracy, while furnishing \"grist for the Communist propaganda mills,\" according to the brief. Likewise, President Franklin Roosevelt didn't integrate the defense industry because it suddenly became clear Blacks and Whites were equally qualified. He did it to stave off a massive march on Washington as a nation on the brink of World War II clawed its way out of the Great Depression.\"You cannot as a country have the issue of racism sort of percolating or festering at home while trying to project yourself as this paragon of virtue when it comes to democracy abroad,\" Steward said. \"America could not look weak in that particular moment. America could not look undemocratic.\"The video of George FloydDuchess Harris, an American studies professor at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, echoes Yancy's thoughts on vulnerability -- especially White people's vulnerability and \"their relationship to illness and not being able to live life on their own terms.\"It's just one in a complex collection of variables that explain the protests' duration, she said.Early Covid-19 quarantines meant people were home with ample time to watch the Floyd video, which rapidly spread across social media and TV. It was also the eve of summer, the season of protests, she said, noting that Spike Lee's 1989 \"Do the Right Thing,\" about racial tensions and a police violence protest in Brooklyn, opens on a stifling summer day.The financial turmoil from the pandemic hit young people hard; they're the backbone of social movements, she explained. Summer is a time for the youth to vacation or find a summer job. Neither was an option, she said, explaining she knows a summa cum laude graduate who took a nanny job because she had no prospects. This gave people more time to take to the streets, she said.The economic conditions also helped many empathize with Floyd, who had just lost his job and was accused of trying to pass a fake $20 bill at a grocery store, the professor said. JUST WATCHEDVideo shows Minneapolis officer kneeling on George Floyd's neckReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHVideo shows Minneapolis officer kneeling on George Floyd's neck 03:01\"Even if we acquiesce there was a fake $20 bill,\" Harris said, \"he's dead because of that. ... Why was he using fake money? That's structural inequality.\"The locale was important, too. Minnesotans have weathered dozens of police killings in recent years, including the high-profile deaths of Philando Castile and Jamar Clark, she said. Like video of Floyd's killing, Castile's went viral, but it begins after the officer shot him five times. Castile is bleeding out as his girlfriend chronicles what happened. Floyd's death drags out over 10 minutes of footage as Floyd pleads for his life, which is snuffed out as three officers look on without physically intervening. Going back to the 1991 Rodney King beating, Americans have watched police violence, but bits are often missing or extenuating circumstances allow them to explain it away. Not this time, scholars say. The depiction of Floyd's death was too timely, vivid and undebatable to ignore. \"The visual trauma which people were exposed to was a necessary condition to what we're seeing,\" Yancy said. 'I can't breathe'White and Black interests converge today for many reasons. It can't be undersold that the delayed reaction to the Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor killings dovetailed with the anger over Floyd's death, about two weeks before an Atlanta policeman killed Rayshard Brooks. The confluence of the four killings serves to underline problems with racial and police violence, experts say. Video of Floyd's death, however, was a clarion call, Yancy said. Viewers watched, uninterrupted, as an officer kneels on the prone, handcuffed 46-year-old for almost eight minutes as he cries, \"I can't breathe\" and calls out for his mother before his ability to articulate is sapped. Still, the officer continues to kneel. Bystanders protest, but they're helpless.\"I can't breathe\" evokes Eric Garner's 2014 death at the hands of New York police, but it's also an existential cry, a concept that \"goes back to the Middle Passage, to the hulls of those slave ships,\" Yancy said. JUST WATCHED'I can't breathe': Moments that shaped a movement ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'I can't breathe': Moments that shaped a movement  07:47\"The very breath of this Black man was being taken from his body,\" he said of the video. \"It pricked the conscience of White people.\"While the Floyd protests demonstrate a heretofore unseen endurance over a single event, Steward said protests' durations have been growing since Ferguson, where demonstrators took to the street for weeks after Michael Brown's shooting, when a grand jury declined to indict Officer Darren Wilson and again on the anniversary of Brown's death. \"Ferguson is not to be downplayed as a harbinger of this moment,\" the history professor said, adding that every major racial protest, going back to the anti-lynching and Red Summer demonstrations of the early 1900s, was a phase leading to today.What's different here, Steward said, is the myriad White faces. Past police brutality protests generally have been African American affairs. With the coronavirus exposing White people to uncertainty about their health and financial well-being -- concerns more pronounced in Black communities due to systemic inequality -- \"you have individuals who are facing challenges they see as part and parcel of the same system,\" Steward said. Others simply may be more willing to coalesce with protesters.Credit has to go to the Black Lives Matter movement, he said, which keeps the spotlight on White supremacy, police violence \"and its White supremacist tentacles,\" Black-on-Black crime and violence targeting LGBTQ communities. Where BLM was for years unutterable among swaths of the White population, today protests erupt not only in cities with vibrant Black communities (Detroit, Baltimore, Atlanta, et al) but also the largely White enclaves of Prairie Village, Kansas, Northfield, Minnesota, Pullman, Washington, and notably, Portland, Oregon. Steward's seen them in Williamstown, Massachusetts, where he teaches and where four out of five residents are White. Pew polls from 2016 and earlier this summer indicate BLM support has jumped from 43% to 67% in four years. Support among Whites has spiked 20 percentage points in that time, to 60%.For weeks since Floyd's killing, protesters have taken to Portland streets. He also sees more BLM signs popping up in White people's yards, he said: \"It's like grass nowadays. It's ubiquitous, right? Some of it is performative, but more people are comfortable saying it because they're more awakened to the disparities Blacks face in the country.\"Steward and Yancy also point to the movement's internationality. Steward compares it to the global outcry that upended apartheid in South Africa. In recent months, Australia, France, New Zealand, Sweden, the United Kingdom and other predominantly White nations have staged their own BLM protests in solidarity.  \"They all felt the sting of White supremacy within their own historical contexts,\" Yancy said. Vicarious traumaThe nature of trauma is another factor in how the world reacts to Floyd's death, said Dr. Cheryl Singleton Al-Mateen, a professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at Virginia Commonwealth University.\"Watching something horrifying happen to someone else could be a criteria for (post-traumatic stress disorder),\" she said. \"We all had an experience criterion that could result in the development of PTSD. It happened to the entire country -- not just the country but the world because other countries reacted for us, too.\"It's called vicarious trauma, and it takes many forms. Native Americans, Jewish people, African Americans, Japanese Americans and other minorities may experience historical trauma based on horrors exacted on others sharing their identity -- something Al-Mateen says amounts to a \"cumulative wounding across generations even if there's no direct experience.\"Health care workers in West Covina, California, kneel in solidarity with protesters June 11.Al-Mateen was horrified by the Floyd video, she said, but her dismay was compounded when she joined a White Coats for Black Lives demonstration in which health care workers knelt for the eight minutes and 46 seconds the officer reportedly knelt on Floyd (the report was later revised to seven minutes, 46 seconds). \"It hits you. It hits you very hard. This man was kneeling on his neck for this long,\" she said. Where Al-Mateen stops short of saying that watching the Floyd video caused varying degrees of PTSD among Americans, Janet Helms, a Boston College professor of counseling and psychology, says that's exactly what happened. \"The trauma is triggered by seeing the video over and over again,\" said Helms, who is also the director of the school's Institute for the Study and Promotion of Race and Culture.Black people may not know anyone who was lynched or enslaved, but they know their parents' and grandparents' stories of life under Jim Crow, and they share their histories with slaves.\"When you see someone being treated in the way you've heard about,\" she explained, \"you experience the trauma in the same way.\"Her center provides a toolkit for those experiencing racial trauma. In it, Helms and her co-authors wrote, \"Racial trauma is a cumulative experience, where every personal or vicarious encounter with racism contributes to a more insidious, chronic stress.\"JUST WATCHEDVan Jones calls out the dehumanization of African American menReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHVan Jones calls out the dehumanization of African American men 03:00Whites, too, experienced trauma, and Floyd's killing helped humanize Black people in the minds of Whites, especially White women, Helms said. \"George Floyd turned Black men into human beings for White people, and he did that by calling out for his mother,\" she said. \"Covid made White people sit and look at the murder of George Floyd. They couldn't get away from it, especially White women. ... They became aware they were allowing this to happen.\"Most important to the cause, Helms said, is the broad support of White men, who have joined the recent protests as well. They are the gatekeepers to change. It must be remembered, she said, \"White men wrote a whole Constitution to protect the privilege of White, heterosexual men.\"Maintaining the momentumYancy is pessimistic about the ultimate outcome. Paraphrasing Malcolm X, he said you can't plunge a knife 9 inches into Black people's back, pull it out 6 inches and call it progress. \"There's 3 inches to go, and there's a wound,\" the professor said, explaining that leaving the wound open intensifies vulnerability. \"We have to open up and allow ourselves to be wounded by the violence. It has to be registered as angst or deep pain.\"Despite his skepticism, he said, \"I would have to grant something bigger is happening here.\"Past protests didn't last as long, Helms said, because White people felt \"those events had nothing to do with them,\" but the Floyd video and uprising viscerally exposed Whites to the trauma Blacks have always experienced.\"To keep the movement going, White people have to stay in touch with that feeling,\" said Helms, who authored \"A Race Is a Nice Thing to Have: A Guide to Being a White Person or Understanding the White Persons in Your Life.\"JUST WATCHEDBlack Lives Matter supporters gather across globeReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBlack Lives Matter supporters gather across globe 02:24The movement can sustain steam \"as long as White people are involved in anti-racism and re-learn to think of themselves as moral humans and see others as human beings,\" she said. Steward, the history professor, said White people must demand real change, rather than perpetuating an archaic system of race management that favors the symbolic and performative. Policies must have teeth. School integration doesn't work without busing, he said, and body-cam policies are worthless if police aren't prosecuted. \"You have to see more than a statue come down. You have to see more than a policy,\" he said. \"There's a number of people willing to say, 'I agree.' Now, they have to go beyond a yard sign, go beyond rhetoric.\"He, too, quotes MLK -- who said, \"The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice\" -- and he emphasizes America has a considerable journey. \"The arc of history is slouching toward justice,\" Steward said. \"It certainly is not there.\"",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)When President Donald Trump first raised the idea Monday morning of emerging from the 13-foot gate that surrounds the White House, aides were skeptical.The logistics of any last-minute presidential movement are difficult even under normal circumstances, and these were anything but. For three straight nights, protests around the 18-acre White House compound had turned volatile and fiery, at one point sending Trump into an underground bunker with his family. But Trump was determined to show he was still in charge and that the situation, at least outside his own front door, was under control. As he conferred with top military brass at the White House over how to quell protests around the country, Trump said he wanted to make the walk to the nearby historic St. John's Church, where a fire had been set in the basement the previous night.In the ensuing hours, White House officials hurried to make arrangements for the evening event, which ultimately devolved into a discordant and violent spectacle, with federal law enforcement agents clashing with protesters in Lafayette Square, a federally owned greenspace north of the White House. A day after the incident, interviews with White House officials and sources across the government reveal a confusing, harried series of decisions that were not fully coordinated, as well as conflicting accounts of who was in charge and how a peaceful protest ended in a violent confrontation. Read MoreIn an interview with CNN on Monday, Washington police Chief Peter Newsham said he didn't know about the plans until only about 30 to 45 minutes before the visit happened, and that his officers were not involved. Trump's walk to the church also appears to have come as a surprise to the Interior Department, whose secretary, David Bernhardt, wasn't at the White House and didn't get a heads up in advance that the park -- which his department oversees -- was going to be cleared of protesters so quickly. Even some of the top administration officials who trailed Trump as he strode to the church suggested later they were caught off guard to find themselves in the middle of the highly fraught picture.Barr gave the orderUltimately, it was Attorney General William Barr who ordered the move to clear protesters, according to a Justice Department official. Barr and other top officials from agencies responsible for securing the White House had previously planned to secure a wider perimeter around Lafayette Square in response to fires and destruction caused by protesters on Sunday night. Attorney General William Barr stands in Lafayette Square across from the White House as demonstrators gather to protest the death of George Floyd.That plan, had it been enacted, would have cleared the area by 4 p.m., the official said, not 25 minutes before the 7 p.m. curfew put in place by Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, which is ultimately what happened. It's unclear whether Barr's order was communicated to Park Police and other officers on the front lines. Barr eventually appeared in Lafayette Square shortly before 6 p.m. Monday, about an hour before Trump left the White House. In a scene that was captured on news cameras, Barr stood flanked by a security detail, his chief of staff and the head of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel. As Barr surveyed the situation around the park, some protesters spotted and recognized him, and shouts went up. Barr had been told that police believed protesters were gathering rocks to throw at law enforcement, and while he was in the park, water bottles were thrown in his direction, the official said. CNN did not witness any water bottles being thrown at the attorney general. Before walking to the White House, Barr told police to clear the area, the Justice Department official said. If federal law enforcement was met with resistance by the protesters, crowd control measures should be implemented, Barr told them, according to the official. Preparations for a speechMeanwhile in the White House, staffers had begun preparing the Rose Garden with a stage, podium and teleprompters, even though it wasn't yet certain Trump had finalized his decision to deliver remarks or venture outside the complex.After a morning that included a telephone call with President Vladimir Putin of Russia and a video-conference spent berating the nation's governors for appearing \"weak\" in the face of violent protests, Trump and his aides began considering a short address to precede the walk through Lafayette Square. While it was Trump who came up with the idea of the church visit, senior adviser Hope Hicks, chief of staff Mark Meadows, as well as Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and his daughter Ivanka Trump, were involved in the initial planning of the operation, according to two senior White House officials. The final decision to visit the church came roughly five hours before police and military forces swarmed the park to clear out the protesters, though officials in the press office were not looped into the plan until much later. As reporters were scrambled to the Rose Garden to set up for Trump's speech, loud bangs began on the other side of the White House fence.Just after 6:22 p.m., the transmission came over the police radios -- US Park Police had issued the first warning to protesters, a law enforcement source told CNN. With Barr gone from the scene, authorities made their move, with lines of federal officers in riot gear converging on the protesters.A violent advanceThe advance by Park Police was swift and sudden. There were fewer protesters in the park than there had been the day before, but the crowd was energized, alternating between chants supporting the movement -- \"Say his name: George Floyd!\" -- and other more aggressive chants aimed at the wall of forces in riot gear lined up facing them.As authorities converged, demonstrators started running, smoke filled the air and a loud pop sounded of projectiles being fired at those fleeing. Canisters sending up thick clouds of smoke and irritants landed at their feet and all but the few with gas masks started coughing as they were pushed back.Police clash with protesters during a demonstration on June 1, 2020 in Washington, DC.  \"People were running. And I was trying to help clear out people's eyes,\" said Rev. Gina Gerbasi, the rector at a different St. John's Church in Georgetown who was at the Lafayette Square location on Monday evening. \"Police were on the patio pushing people out. Tear gas, the flash bang things.\"\"I am just a middle-aged white woman priest and a mom,\" she said. \"It was completely unprovoked. I didn't hear bullhorns saying 'the President's coming.'\"A spokesperson for the Park Police said its officers were using pepper balls, not tear gas. Though the two have different chemical make-ups, they are both strong irritants that are used by law enforcement. Eyewitness accounts show canisters put off thick smoke that clearly contained an irritant that made people choke and cough. On Tuesday, the Park Police issued a statement saying the decision to move on protesters was made to \"curtail\" violence, and that various objects had been thrown by protesters. CNN's reporter who was on the scene all Monday afternoon did not witness any violence by the protesters, or anything being thrown by them. The protesters who held the line confronted the advancing Park Police chanting \"no justice, no peace.\" Behind the row of police on foot was another on horseback. Deafening flash bangs were fired as they pushed forward. A young man hit by pepper spray was pushed by an officer as he shouted \"I can't see, I can't see.\"\"You're shooting at people with their hands up!\" one protester shouted. \"We are not a threat!\" shouted another.The volleys kept coming. Protesters were flushed onto Connecticut Avenue, many coughing deeply, the canisters whizzing and spinning as they landed.A middle-aged man was caught in a building's alcove as the Park Police pressed forward, firing projectiles at him. He was holding his chest, clearly in distress. Demonstrators ran forward as the projectiles kept coming, helping to carry him away from the advancing forces. By the time 7 p.m. finally arrived -- when Washington's curfew went into effect -- the melee was all but over. The streets around the park and the White House had been emptied of protesters. The violence sent many home. Many others lingered and -- now out on the streets where Washington's police force has jurisdiction -- were rounded up and detained for breaking the curfew.A walk to rememberAt 7:01 p.m. ET, Trump emerged from the North Portico of the White House, striding down the driveway and toward a cordon of law enforcement officers. Behind him trailed a large cadre of senior White House aides, including Ivanka Trump -- carrying a designer purse with a Bible tucked inside -- and her husband Jared, both senior advisers; chief of staff Mark Meadows; and press secretary Kayleigh McEnany.President Donald Trump holds a Bible as he visits outside St. John's Church across Lafayette Park from the White House Monday, June 1, 2020. Also joining Trump were Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, who had been summoned to the Oval Office in the preceding hours to update the President on efforts to use the military to tamp down on violence.A US defense official told reporters Monday that Esper and Milley \"were not aware that the Park Police and law enforcement had made a decision to clear the square.\"And the official suggested neither man planned to join Trump as he walked across Lafayette Square to the church.\"As that meeting concluded, the President indicated an interest in viewing the troops that were outside, and the secretary and the chairman went with him to do so. That was the extent of what was taking place,\" the official said.All of the aides who appeared alongside Trump were white; the President has only a few senior African American advisers and his sole black Cabinet member, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, was not present, though Trump and Carson spoke by phone earlier Monday.Vice President Mike Pence, the President's frequent emissary to religious conservatives, was also conspicuously absent from the walk to St. John's. A source familiar with the matter suggested Pence did not join Trump out of deference and to allow the President \"his own spotlight.\"\"I think the vice president instinctively knows when it's a presidential moment and when it's not,\" the source said. \"Yesterday was very much a presidential moment.\"It's not clear if the President asked Pence to join him for the walk, but the two men had their private weekly lunch earlier the same day.Even as Trump stepped out of the White House and into Lafayette Square, some White House officials insisted the maneuver was unrelated to his photo opportunity.Some officials claimed the push was aimed at establishing a broader perimeter around Lafayette Square and the blocks around the White House. White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere claimed the perimeter was expanded to help enforce DC's 7 p.m. curfew -- an explanation that strained credulity given security forces began to fire tear gas and rubber bullets to push back protesters before the curfew came into effect.The officials could not explain why they needed to establish a perimeter in time for the curfew or why they did not do so earlier in the day, before a large group of protesters had amassed.One White House official said Monday aides now recognize the operation to clear out protesters from the Lafayette Square area should have been carried our earlier in the day in order to avoid the chaos that erupted. \"Maybe they should have done it a couple of hours earlier,\" the official said. \"The timing didn't seem to work out for what the optics were.\"A messy aftermathAs night descended on the capital Monday, and groups of protesters remained in the street in spite of a city-ordered curfew, Milley, Esper and Barr took to the streets of Washington to survey the ongoing military and federal law enforcement effort to clear the streets of protesters. Milley, whom Trump claimed would be \"in charge\" of the military response, surveyed the scene like a field general, camouflage military fatigues and all.Barr monitored events, first in person near Farragut Square a few blocks from the White House. Video captured by news crews shows Barr standing on a broad sidewalk, milling around alongside men in suits, military officials in camouflage fatigues and law enforcement on bicycles, flashing red and blue light from nearby sirens reflecting off of his face. He later spent hours at a Justice Department command center. After a news conference on Tuesday, Newsham, the DC police chief who has worked for the Metropolitan Police Department for three decades, lamented the show of force on Monday.\"The large majority of police officers in this country, certainly the police officers in this city, are very well meaning people trying to do the right thing,\" he told CNN. \"Whenever you have a police action that paints police in a negative light, it's hurtful to me because that action can be attribute to all police officers,\" he said.  At the same news conference, Bowser said she did not \"see any provocation that would warrant the deployment of munitions and especially for the purpose of moving the president across the street.\"  A couple hours earlier, Trump took to Twitter to tout the \"overwhelming force\" and \"domination\" in Washington the previous night, before thanking himself: \"thank you President Trump!\"CNN's Katelyn Polantz, Pete Muntean, Jim Acosta and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)DC Mayor Muriel Bowser has issued a citywide curfew from 11 p.m. ET Sunday through 6 a.m. ET Monday following a weekend of unrest in the nation's capital.Skirmishes between groups of protesters and law enforcement flared across the city on Friday and Saturday night as tensions played out over the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man in Minneapolis who was pinned down by police. Bowser stressed Sunday that protesters have the right to exercise the First Amendment but should not \"destroy our city\" in the process. \"We're sending a very clear message to people that they have a right to exercise their First Amendment rights, but not to destroy our city,\" Bowser said in an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"We saw a level of just destruction and mayhem among some that was maddening.\"The DC Fire Department extinguished two vehicle fires in the area north of the White House Saturday night, as well as several small fires in the downtown area. Some protesters also put up graffiti on some buildings.Read MoreDC Chief of Police Peter Newsham said Sunday that the Metropolitan Police Department had arrested 17 people Saturday night and that 11 MPD officers were injured during the protests. None of the officers sustained life-threatening injuries, though one officer is undergoing surgery for multiple compound fractures to his leg after a protester threw a rock at him. Newsham said that of the 17 people arrested, eight either live in DC or have some ties to the area. He said police expect to make more arrests, as the department is asking private businesses to review their security footage, and will ask the DC community to help identify those who were damaging property or hurting people.More than 60 US Secret Service personnel were injured from Friday night through Sunday morning near the White House, according to a statement from the Secret Service. At one point on Friday night, President Donald Trump was briefly taken to the underground bunker, according to a White House official and a law enforcement source.To this point, Trump has adopted an uneven message on the demonstrations. While in some appearances he has taken a measured approach in calling for calm, on Twitter he has used violent rhetoric and seemed to suggest on Saturday his supporters stage a counter-protest outside the White House.Bowser on Sunday urged Trump to help \"calm the nation\" and to stop sending \"divisive tweets that are meant to harken back to the segregationist past of our country.\"On Saturday, Trump wrongly accused Bowser in a tweet of not allowing the DC Metropolitan Police Department to help the Secret Service keep control of the situation with protesters in Lafayette Square on Friday night. That claim was later refuted by the US Secret Service who confirmed in a statement that the DC police department and US Park police were on the scene. Bowser responded to Trump on Twitter Saturday, saying that the DC police department, \"will always protect DC and all who are in it whether I agree with them (such as those exercising their First Amendment Right) or those I don't (namely, @realdonaldtrump).\"The DC mayor said while Trump \"hides behind his fence afraid/alone,\" she stands with people \"peacefully exercising their First Amendment Right after the murder\" of Floyd and \"hundreds of years of institutional racism.\"Trump also tweeted that protesters \"would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen,\" if they breached the fence outside the White House.In a press conference Saturday, Bowser noted how Trump's reference to the \"ominous dogs\" was \"no subtle reminder\" of segregationists who would attack African Americans with dogs.She added that the city is working on cleaning up after protests and is coordinating with law enforcement \"to ensure calm in our city.\"Atlanta mayor on Trump: 'He should just stop talking'Newsham echoed that message Sunday, praising the behavior of police \"incredibly responsible, heroic, in many instances,\" and said he doesn't expect Sunday night to be \"a repeat of last night.\"Still, a law enforcement source tells CNN that US Park Police, in a situational report Sunday afternoon, informed law enforcement stationed in Lafayette Park that demonstrators have brought boxes of rocks to an evening protest across from the White House. Another person was observed with a bat, the report stated. The information was shared with other law enforcement agencies on hand for the protest, the source said.Earlier Sunday, White House executive office staff received an email urging them to stay away from the White House complex, if possible, due to \"ongoing demonstrations.\"\"Due to ongoing demonstrations, please avoid coming to the White House Complex today if at all possible,\" the email reads, in part. \"The White House currently maintains an elevated security posture.\"The email directs \"essential\" employees, who still need to work on the complex, to a specific entrance and to follow Secret Service instructions.This story has been updated with additional developments.

        "content": "(CNN)One of three major wildfires roaring though California has burned its way into state history as the most destructive blaze on record in terms of structure loss, with more than 6,700 structures gone in two days, according to Cal Fire, the state's fire-fighting agency.The large Camp Fire in Northern California, which obliterated 80% to 90% of the homes in one town, has left at least nine people dead, officials said Friday. Kory Honea, the Butte County sheriff, said 35 people have been reported missing in the Camp Fire.The fast-moving wildfires in the state have destroyed thousands of structures and prompted thousands of residents to flee, sometimes through jam-packed flame-lined streets that forced evacuees to chose whether to try to drive to safety or to get out and run.The Camp Fire left the mayor of Paradise, population 26,000, in shock. \"There's really not much left. There are very few homes still standing and we've been in multiple different neighborhoods this afternoon,\" Mayor Jody Jones said. She estimated only 10 to 20% of homes are left.Read MoreFour people were found dead in vehicles that were overcome by flames and one body was discovered near the vehicles, the Butte County Sheriff's Office said. The other victims were found near or inside homes that burned.Two major fires in Southern California are just miles from the bar where 12 people were killed in a mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, and evacuations were ordered for nearby Malibu, a seaside city popular with celebrities.Authorities have received reports of two fatalities in the city of Malibu, and the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner's office said it was working to confirm whether they are related to the wildfires.Fanned by high winds and fueled by low humidity and dry vegetation, the fires spread rapidly Thursday and overnight into Friday. The threat continued Friday, with millions of Californians under \"red flag\" warnings portending windy arid and warm conditions that pose extreme fire risks.Here's what we know about the trio of fires:Camp Fire: People flee 'carrying their babies and kids'In Northern California, panicked residents began fleeing Paradise on Thursday as the Camp Fire swept through it.By Friday morning, the town's main road was littered with downed trees and power lines. Much of the brush and grasses were blackened along the valleys, and many trees were still burning, a CNN crew there observed.A family that evacuated Thursday by driving along flame-lined roads posted a startling video to Facebook. The recording shows fire claiming houses and trees, and sparks blowing across the road in front of them. Suddenly the vehicle breaks through a wall of smoke and emerges into the safety of a clear road. Jones, the mayor, said a good portion of the business district is gone. And while some trees were torched, Jones said most of them remain.\"One of the things that's beautiful about Paradise are the trees and they're still here. ... I wasn't expecting that, but it's a good thing,\" Jones said.At least 52,000 residents were forced to evacuate from Butte County as the fire burned 90,000 acres.Flames also were on the outer edges of Chico, a city of 93,000 people about a 90-mile drive north of Sacramento. The full extent of the destruction in the county was still unknown, but authorities said more than 6,700 buildings have been destroyed -- many of those in Paradise.Whitney Vaughan described a scene of panic and terror as she recalled her narrow escape from her Paradise home Thursday morning.California wildfire destroys Paradise: 'There wasn't anywhere to go'Vaughan and her husband had just fled their home as flames rushed them. She saw a man \"sprinting past our house carrying a little baby, running as fast as he could.\"They drove away but got eventually got caught in traffic. Flames were feet away, smoke was thick, cars weren't moving and people were panicking. Some people left their cars there \"and took off running, carrying their babies and kids.\"She cried as she recorded video of the terrifying scene, which she posted to Facebook. She and her husband eventually were able to drive away safely.\"We thought the fire was going to kill us,\" she told CNN.Paradise, roughly 80 miles north of Sacramento, is where four people were found dead in different vehicles and one person was found dead near a vehicle on the road where Vaughn recorded her video. The other four deceased victims were also found in the Paradise area.Five people had to be rescued by helicopter from the fire according to Josh Bischof, Riverside Fire Battalion Chief. The rescues were performed by firefighters who were actively engaged in fire-fighting, Bischof said.

At least 75,000 homes in Ventura and Los Angeles counties were under evacuation orders, and some structures have already been destroyed, officials said.The fire crossed US 101 a few miles east of Thousand Oaks -- the site of Wednesday night's bar shooting -- and was headed south to the Pacific coast, in the direction of Malibu Creek State Park and Malibu city, the Los Angeles County Fire Department said.VIDEO: @LACoFireAirOps Firehawk helicopter flying along Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu on the way to protect life and property.

The ex-president of Spain's northern Catalonia region is being held at a police station in Germany, according to a tweet from his lawyer, Jaume Alonso-Cuevillas. Puigdemont was en route to Belgium from Finland and was detained after crossing the border from Denmark.  German police said in a statement that Puigdemont was arrested in the northernmost state of Schleswig-Holstein. Protesters scuffle with riot police at a demonstration in Barcelona on March 25, 2018.Puigdemont has lived in self-imposed exile in Belgium since October, after spearheading Catalonia's referendum on whether to secede from Spain.The independence drive plunged the country into its worst political crisis in decades, with Madrid denouncing the referendum as illegal and calling for Puigdemont's arrest.A protester is pulled by riot police blocking the road leading to the central government in Barcelona on March 25, 2018.Read MoreSpanish authorities accuse Puigdemont of rebellion, sedition and misuse of funds over his role in the referendum, in which 90% of voters were in favor of a split from Madrid. However voter turnout was low -- around 42% -- and Catalan authorities blamed the figure on the election day crackdown initiated by the national government.JUST WATCHEDHistorian: Catalan leader 'an extreme nationalist'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHistorian: Catalan leader 'an extreme nationalist' 05:27Thousands protest, state TV reportsThousands of pro-independence protesters took part in demonstrations in Barcelona, carrying Catalonian flags and banners with slogans emblazoned across them, state media outlet RTVE reported on its website.

        "content": "Austin, Texas (CNN)Days after the Austin bomber blew himself up as police closed in, investigators are no closer to answering the question nearly everyone in the community is asking: Why?Investigators searching for a potential motive are relying on Mark Anthony Conditt's own words from a 25-minute recording he made hours before he was confronted by a SWAT team early Wednesday.In the cellphone recording, Conditt, 23, refers to himself as a \"psychopath\" and shows no contrition for carrying out a nearly three-week-long bombing spree that left two people dead and spread fear across the city. Mark Anthony Conditt\"Why would someone do such a senseless act of random violence? To many of us it doesn't make a whole lot of sense,\" Texas Rep. Michael McCaul said Saturday. \"All we really have at this point in time ... are his own words from his confession tape where he describes himself as a psychopath, apparently expressing no remorse for the killings that he committed.\"It's hard to imagine someone whose mind is so sick that they could commit bombings like this and feel absolutely no remorse,\" McCaul said.Read MoreBoth McCaul and Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said Conditt does not address race in the recording, but authorities have not ruled anything out as the investigation continues. The two victims in the bombings were African-American and the first three bombings were carried out in a largely minority area of Austin, prompting fears of a racially motivated killer. The bomber's mistakeA security camera at a FedEx store south of Austin caught Conditt's red SUV on video, McCaul said.The bomber went to the store on Sunday and made the mistake of parking within view of a surveillance camera that captured the vehicle's license plates, the congressman said.Surveillance photos from the mail delivery office in Sunset Valley showed Conditt wearing a baseball cap, blond wig and pink gloves as he brought two packages to the store. A security camera captured this image of Conditt, in a wig, at a FedEx store.Investigators used cellphone technology to track down Conditt on Wednesday and to confirm that he had been to all of the bombing locations, McCaul said.His SUV was ultimately found later Wednesday, running in a parking lot of a hotel in Round Rock, Manley said. As plainclothes officers and unmarked vehicles descended on the area and authorities worked to get SWAT, tactical and ballistic teams in place, Conditt pulled out of the lot. Authorities followed and a SWAT team performed a tactical maneuver to force Conditt to stop the SUV. The scene where Conditt blew himself up as a SWAT team closed in. Manley praised the officers who confronted Conditt, saying, \"they charged up to a vehicle they knew was likely occupied by the suspect in this incident and that he had a bomb with him. And what happened next was chilling to watch as that explosion went off and one of our SWAT officers flew backward and landed on the ground.\"The officer was not seriously injured. Austin's weeks of 'collective fear'Austin Mayor Steve Adler said the city's \"collective fear and anxiety\" was growing as the bomber carried out the string of attacks.\"There was feeling that there was not much that we could do. There was a collective helplessness,\" Adler said Thursday at a City Council meeting.In Austin, 19 days of terror end with a bomber's final explosion \"Our community was beginning to fray,\" he added.Some residents have breathed sighs of relief since Conditt's death, while others remain shaken up. Narcisa Velasco had rushed to help a friend, a 75-year-old woman who was severely injured on March 12 after picking up a package in front of a southeast Austin home. She said the sight of the woman's bloody wounds and the chaotic scene of debris from the bomb are still haunting her and her family members, some of whom also witnessed the aftermath of the explosion.\"We are sleeping with all the lights on,\" she said. The victimsThe lives of Anthony Stephan House and Draylen Mason were cut short when explosive packages arrived on their doorsteps.The first blast on March 2 killed House, a 39-year-old father who worked as a project manager for Texas Quarries.On March 12, Mason was killed when he brought a package indoors to open it and it exploded, police said. The 17-year-old high school student played bass in a youth orchestra, and was taking college classes.These are the victims of the Austin bombingsBoth men were African-American. Also among the injured were an African-American woman and one Hispanic woman.Prior to Conditt's death, authorities believed the bombings could be racially motivated. But police said Wednesday that Conditt did not mention anything in his video confession about terror or hate.\"I know everybody is interested in a motive and understanding why,\" said Manley, the Austin police chief. \"And we're never going to be able to put a (rationale) behind these acts.\" In a statement, Mason's family thanked law enforcement, saying they felt that Mason has \"received justice.\"\"The most recent chain of events have brought some sense of closure that our beloved has received justice, and we are prayerful that we can now start to move forward with our lives,\" said the statement obtained by CNN affiliate KEYE.Search of bomber's houseFederal agents searched Conditt's home in Pflugerville for almost two days, cautiously removing explosive materials and looking for clues that could point to a reason for the bombings.Authorities surround the home of the Austin bombing suspect Mark Conditt in Pflugerville, Texas, on Wednesday.Investigators discovered components for making similar bombs to the ones that exploded in the past few weeks, but no finished bombs were found, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.The devices that exploded in Austin and near San Antonio were pipe bombs with batteries and smokeless powder and were constructed with materials found in a hardware or sporting goods store, a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN.Austin killer used pipe bombs, source saysThe bombs had distinctive shrapnel inside. Some had \"mousetrap\" switches and others had \"clothespin\" switches, the source said.Two of Conditt's roommates were detained and questioned by police. One of them was released hours after Conditt's death, but the other was not free to go until the next afternoon, police said.They were not arrested, and neither roommate has been publicly identified.  Manley on Saturday left open the possibility the roommates could face more questioning as the investigation continues.

Two civilians also were shot and the suspect was shot and killed later by police, Sheriff Tony Spurlock said.The sheriff said Deputy Zackari Parrish, 29, was killed. The four injured officers are in stable condition, Spurlock told reporters. \"This is a tragic day that we will be feeling for a long time,\" Spurlock said. \"Zack was a good kid, smiley kid. He was eager to work, eager to serve.\"Deputy Zackari Parrish The suspect, who authorities identified as 37-year-old Matthew Riehl, had barricaded himself in a bedroom before he suddenly opened fire with a rifle, hitting four deputies in the apartment, authorities said.Read More\"There were well over 100 rounds fired ... from the suspect,\" Spurlock said.The memorial at our substation showing community support is amazing!

There was a noise complaint call about 3 a.m., but when deputies got there, there was no noise. After they spoke with the roommate in the apartment, they left, the sheriff's office said. \"One male said the suspect was acting bizarre and might be having a mental breakdown,\" the news release said.The second call was dispatched as a domestic disturbance, and by 5:35 a.m. the four deputies had arrived at the scene.The sheriff's office said the roommate returned to the apartment, gave deputies a key and said they could enter the residence. The roommate left, police said.Not long after the deputies found the suspect barricaded in his room, Riehl opened fire, Spurlock said. \"They all went down within almost seconds of each other so it was more of an ambush type of attack on our officers,\" Spurlock said. The sheriff said he was told by a doctor at the emergency room that Parrish suffered mortal wounds.The suspect was killed about 90 minutes later during a shootout when a tactical team went into the apartment, the sheriff's office said.

How could a man suffer a severe spinal cord injury after getting arrested? And what happened in the 30 minutes before he was taken to a hospital? Gray wavered in and out of a coma and died Sunday, one week after his arrest. It's not clear how he suffered the spinal cord injury. But Gray is far from the only suspect who died under questionable circumstances after he was already in custody. Here are several other cases: Phillip White, 32Read MoreDate of arrest: March 31, 2015Date of death: March 31, 2015What happened: Police in Vineland, New Jersey, responded to a call of a disorderly person, and White was arrested and handcuffed. Police dispatch recordings include an officer saying White \"tried to grab my gun.\" One witness, Agustin Ayala, told the Vineland Daily Journal that White was resisting arrest. But two others told WCAU that police attacked White while he was already handcuffed. \"They punched him, stomped him, kicked him and then they let the dog out of the car,\" Ricardo Garcia told the station. \"The dog bit him on his face and around his body. There's no call for that. Once a man is handcuffed and unconscious, you should have stuck him in the patrol car and take him to the police station.\"Witness Luis Martinez gave a similar account.\"The other cop let the dog out, and they just kept punching him and the dog kept biting him at the same time,\" Martinez told WCAU. \"He was on the floor, like he was knocked out.\"As White was taken to a hospital, he became unresponsive, NJ.com reported. He was pronounced dead at the hospital. The aftermath: The Cumberland County Prosecutor's Office has been investigating White's death, and officials have been waiting for the results of White's autopsy to learn the exact cause of death, NJ.com said. Two Vineland officers have been placed on administrative leave. And after Vineland police received criticism on its Facebook page about White's case, the department started hiding unfavorable comments, the Press of Atlantic City reported. An activist filed an Open Public Records Act request, saying the department's official Facebook page was a matter of public record. Vineland police later restored the critical comments on its page. Victor White III, 22 Victor White IIIDate of arrest: March 2, 2014Date of death: March 2, 2014 What happened: Sheriff's deputies in New Iberia, Louisiana, claimed White shot and killed himself in the back of a squad car -- even though White had been frisked and handcuffed. \"Short of him being Houdini or David Copperfield, it's not possible,\" White family attorney Carol Powell-Lexing said.The incident began when authorities were responding to a fight in a gas station parking lot. About six blocks from the store, an Iberia Parish deputy saw White and stopped him, state police said. According to the service report from the Sheriff's Office, Cpl. Justin Ortis received no description of the men involved in the fight. He was told only that they were black, \"and one of the males mentioned having a gun,\" the report said.White consented to a pat-down, and Ortis found marijuana in his pocket.Attorney Benjamin Crump said that detail makes the official narrative even more suspicious. JUST WATCHEDCrump decries 'Houdini handcuff suicides'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCrump decries 'Houdini handcuff suicides' 01:29\"If you pat someone down and you can feel a small package of marijuana, wouldn't you feel a gun?\" he said. State police said once White arrived at the police station, he refused to get out of the patrol car. \"As the deputy requested assistance from other deputies, White produced a handgun and fired one round, striking himself in the back,\" state police said. White was pronounced dead at a local hospital.The aftermath: An autopsy concluded White's death was a suicide -- but said he was shot in the chest, not in the back, like police had said. The autopsy report also said White was \"reportedly in a locked patrol car with his hands handcuffed behind him when officers heard a shot and found the decedent slumped over.\"State police have handed over their investigation to prosecutors, who said a decision won't be made until a federal civil rights investigation wraps up. Kelly Thomas, 37Date of police encounter: July 5, 2011Date of death: July 10, 2011What happened: Officers in Fullerton, California, were responding to a call about a homeless man looking into car windows and pulling on handles of parked cars.Video of the incident showed Thomas, who was schizophrenic, slow to cooperate.Fullerton police Officer Manuel Ramos  then tells him: \"You see my fists? They're getting ready to f--- you up.\"Thomas, who is unarmed and shirtless, stands and another officer walks over. They hit him with their batons and hold him on the ground as he begs for help.JUST WATCHED2012: Graphic beating shown in courtReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH2012: Graphic beating shown in court 03:00\"OK, I'm sorry, dude. I'm sorry!\" he screams. At one point, Thomas says he can't breathe. The officers tell him to lie on his stomach, put his hands behind his back and relax.Toward the end of the beating, the video shows, Thomas cries out for his father: \"Dad! Help me. Help me. Help me, Dad.\"By the end of the video, he is lying in a pool of blood. The aftermath: The Orange County coroner ruled Thomas' death a homicide and said he died after having his chest compressed, leaving him unable to breathe.Thomas' mother, Cathy Thomas, received a $1 million settlement from the city of Fullerton. Officer Ramos was charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter, and Cpl. Jay Patrick Cicinelli was charged of involuntary manslaughter and felony use of excessive force. Both pleaded not guilty. In 2014, a jury acquitted both Ramos and Cicinelli.Jorge Azucena, 26  Date of arrest: September 6, 2013Date of death: September 7, 2013What happened:Azucena was arrested after running a red light and leading Los Angeles police on a chase. Over the next half hour, Azucena repeatedly said he had asthma and couldn't breathe, the Los Angeles Times reported. Officers continued ignoring him. \"Help me, help me, help me,\" he said, according to a report by the Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners. \"I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Help me, please.\"\"You can breathe just fine,\" one sergeant told him, according to the Times. \"You can talk, so you can breathe.\" He didn't breathe for much longer. Azucena was so weak that officers had to carry him to a station's holding cell for booking and left him face-down on the floor, the Times reported. By the time paramedics arrived, Azucena's heart had stopped.The aftermath: A coroner concluded that asthma probably killed Azucena and that his death was an accident.  Last month, the Los Angeles City Council unanimously agreed to a $1.35 million settlement for Azucena's mother, the Times said. The investigation into the officers' actions is ongoing. Jesus Huerta, 17Jesus HuertaDate of arrest: November 19, 2013Date of death: November 19, 2013What happened: An officer in Durham, North Carolina, was taking Huerta to the police station for a second-degree trespassing violation.The Durham Police Department said the teen died from a self-inflicted gunshot while handcuffed in the back of the squad car.Durham police Chief Jose Lopez said gunshot residue tests were conducted on Huerta and the arresting officer, and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation \"found that Huerta was wearing gloves and that his gloves had a saturation of gunshot residue on it. Officer (Samuel) Duncan's revealed that he had no gunshot residue on his hands.\"But Huerta's family, like Victor White's family in Louisiana, suspect foul play by police. The aftermath: Hundreds of protesters took to the streets of Durham to decry Huerta's death. Some carried banners that read, \"Fue Matado Por La Policia\" or \"Murdered By Police.\"A vigil for Huerta turned violent, with six people arrested. The police chief said that as a Hispanic, he had trouble believing the allegations among the Hispanic community that Durham police unfairly target Latinos.CNN's Eliott C.

        "content": "(CNN)A former Trump White House official said then-President Donald Trump initially refused to tweet the words \"stay peaceful\" as the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, was escalating. As a violent pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol and sent lawmakers scrambling for their lives, Trump tweeted at 2:38 p.m. ET that day: \"Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!\" The tweet came 20 minutes after Trump supporters were smashing through windows and evacuations of lawmakers had begun.The former official, who was working in the West Wing and was close to White House messaging during the insurrection, said Trump did not want to include the words \"stay peaceful\" and was \"very reluctant to put out anything when it was unfolding.\" Trump was \"letting it play out,\" the official said of the violence at the Capitol.Top Trump aides -- including the then-President's daughter, Ivanka, and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows -- were pleading with Trump to call off the mob, the ex-aide said. Those officials eventually convinced Trump to include the \"stay peaceful\" message in the tweet about the Capitol Police, the former aide added. A Trump spokesperson denied that Trump resisted including the \"stay peaceful\" message in the tweet.Read MoreThe former staffer's account that Trump was resisting the \"stay peaceful\" portion of the tweet runs counter to excuses given by Trump allies that the then-President was urging his supporters to avoid violent acts in their protest of the January 6 certification of Joe Biden's victory. Trump's reluctance to issue a forceful message was an indication he understood the impact that his Twitter account had on his supporters, the ex-aide said.The former official, who relayed the account to the House select committee investigating January 6,, says congressional investigators are requesting specific information from Trump staffers who are cooperating with the probe.Aides are being asked about the days leading up to the insurrection at the Capitol, conversations among key officials, and minute-by-minute details about what was happening behind closed doors at the White House, the ex-official added.The former official, who declined to be named out of fear of retaliation, described January 6 as \"one of the darkest days in our nation's history.\"Other Trump staffers described the then-President as enjoying the mob violence as he watched live TV coverage of the insurrection at the Capitol. Trump was \"loving\" it, a separate former senior White House official said.Former White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham, who was working as the chief of staff to the first lady on January 6, 2021, told CNN Thursday that Trump was \"gleefully\" watching television coverage of the riot. Trump's actions and inactions during the Capitol attack have become a major line of inquiry for the January 6 select committee. Rep. Liz Cheney, the committee's top Republican, has said the panel already has obtained testimony establishing that senior Trump aides attempted to prod the then-President to do more.\"He could have told them to stand down. He could have told them to go home, and he failed to do so,\" Cheney said of Trump.\"We have firsthand testimony that his daughter Ivanka went in at least twice to ask him to please stop this violence,\" she continued.That \"stay peaceful\" tweet was posted 14 minutes following a separate Trump tweet assailing then-Vice President Mike Pence for refusing to overturn the 2020 election results.\"Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. USA demands the truth!\" Trump tweeted from his @realDonaldTrump account, which has since been permanently suspended by Twitter.",

        "content": "(CNN)If all goes to plan, a Moroccan-born, trilingual former pharmaceutical executive may be one of the few senior figures to escape the Trump administration with his reputation enhanced.Moncef Slaoui has presided over Operation Warp Speed, the US drive to develop Covid-19 vaccines in record time. With several vaccines ready for regulatory approval, there's every sign that, unlike most of the White House's disastrous crisis response, the vaccine program will be a great success. Unlike many other key figures in the Covid-19 team still in good standing with President Donald Trump, Slaoui disdained the unwarranted triumphalism and on-camera sycophancy the President requires of his subordinates. His plain-spoken and rare public comments are rooted in science rather than politics. Slaoui took the job only after being assured of no political interference from a President who had hoped news of a vaccine would guarantee him a second term. He doesn't agree with Trump's refusal to join a global compact to ensure fair vaccine access to less well-off nations.True, Slaoui's initial prediction in May that a few hundred million doses could be available by the end of the year was too optimistic. And Senate Democrats complained that the former GlaxoSmithKline executive's consulting contract allowed him not to disclose potential industry conflicts of interest.But the development of several highly effective vaccines, which Slaoui says could get the US toward herd immunity by next May, will stand as one of the Trump administration's clearest legacy wins, even if the President's claims of all the credit are not fair to scientists and companies that did the hard work.Slaoui's role as America's vaccine savior is also rather ironic. He is a poster child for the open immigration laws that Trump and his aides have spent the last four years trying to curtail. Born in Muslim-majority Morocco, he headed to Europe for his education and is a fluent Arabic, French and English speaker. After arriving in America in the 1980s, he later pursued a career fighting diseases like cervical cancer, meningitis and malaria. Read MoreSlaoui said recently that the immigrant pipeline brought \"talent, innovation, diversity, energy and renewal to all societies, and has been a key element underpinning the successes that the United States has enjoyed over the past decades.\"'We have not seen fraud ... 'When even William Barr says it's over, it really is over.The attorney general, who has often behaved more like Trump's personal lawyer, this week hammered one of the final blows against the President's bogus claims that the election was stolen from him. Barr, who before Americans voted had echoed Trump's false claims that mail-in voting was not secure, said the Justice Department had looked but couldn't find evidence of widespread cheating.\"To date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election,\" Barr told The Associated Press in an interview.His comments will make Republican leaders -- who still refuse to call Joe Biden President-elect for fear of enraging Trump's supporters -- appear even more disingenuous.Even though Barr has intervened in several sensitive legal situations to help Trump -- i.e. reshaping the narrative of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia report -- the President is certain to feel betrayed since he has made clear that anyone who works in his administration has a higher loyalty to him than to the law, facts or reality. Perhaps trying to soften the blow, Barr did offer Trump and supporters a gift on the way out of the door, announcing that John Durham, a prosecutor who has spent months investigating the origins of the Russia investigation -- without turning up much evidence of serious wrongdoing by Obama-era officials -- would now serve as a special counsel.This is not just a change of job title. It means that the investigations into the investigators will drag on into the Biden administration and become a landmine for whoever the President-elect chooses as his attorney general.  Any suspicion of trying to influence the Durham probe will cause shrieks of outrage from Republicans who stood by while Trump trampled all over the Justice Department's independence. And the mere existence of the Durham investigation will fuel months of conspiratorial TV for conservative pundits and will seed Trump's fantasy that he is the victim of an establishment plot.",

(CNN)One of Donald Trump's services to history will be to underscore just how much the integrity of the presidency depends on the character of its incumbent.Most presidents at least demonstrate some reverence for the office, understand how easily the public trust on which it stands can be abused and retain a concept of a national interest that supersedes their own. Trump's obliviousness to such rules is on display in an extraordinary debate about his looming use of the president's absolute pardon power.Departing presidents usually grant clemency to those who suffered miscarriages of justice or who have served long terms for nonviolent crimes. But many have also used this constitutional gift to absolve cronies: Bill Clinton, for instance, pardoned his brother after he pleaded guilty to cocaine charges. President Gerald Ford pardoned his predecessor Richard Nixon, hoping to heal the country after Watergate. But accepting a pardon generally involves an admission of guilt on behalf of the convicted person, a willingness to live within the bounds of the law or the notion that society will benefit from granting mercy.Trump, who has already ignored the official government pardon process in sprinkling clemency on several political allies, is now considering preemptive absolution for his children Don Jr., Eric and Ivanka, and even \u2014 in an incredible constitutional leap \u2014 himself. Other presidential operatives, like Trump's legal fixer Rudy Giuliani, are also reportedly angling for pardons. He is said to fear that a Democratic Justice Department could come after his kin after he leaves office, assuming that President-elect Joe Biden will abuse his powers just as Trump has. But there's no sense that the first family would get clemency for admitted wrongdoing. The aim would be more to shut down any pending investigations they face in civilian life and apparently offer get-out-of-jail-free cards for any past criminality.Read MoreWhile a president can help out whoever he wants, federal pardons would not derail state and local cases embroiling the Trumps.Still, all his life, the President has proved that if you are willing to trample the spirit of the law, you can get away with almost anything. Fire and iceCleveland and Fraser Island are on opposite ends of the Earth, and it shows. But in Cleveland, Ohio, a winter storm dumped heavy wet snow on Tuesday that cut power for  thousands to lose power. Massive bush fires on Fraser Island off the coast of Australia, were captured by Queensland Fire and Emergency Services on Monday. So far more than 187,800 acres have been enveloped by flames. \n'A kind of biological jiujitsu'Boris Johnson stole Donald Trump's thunder.The British Prime Minister won the race to be the first Western leader to announce the approval of a Covid-19 vaccine -- offering the promise to his people of a return to dearly missed normal life within months. Instead of a Stars and Stripes-draped White House news conference, it was Johnson, flanked by union flags at 10 Downing Street, who got to hail the regulatory green light for the Pfizer/BioNTech dose he said performs \"biological jiujitsu to turn the virus on itself.\" But Johnson, striking a note that Trump would almost certainly have ignored, also pleaded with Britons not to gather in large numbers and let their guard down until the vaccine is widely available.TV-addict Trump, who had to endure a day full of cable news stories highlighting Britain's regulatory breakthrough, isn't happy. Dr. Stephen Hahn, head of the Food and Drug Administration, which must approve US vaccines, has been hauled into the White House twice in two days to explain why the US wasn't first.\"(Trump) wants to put out as many vaccines as possible between now and January,\" a person familiar with the President's thinking told CNN. \"He doesn't want Biden to get any credit for it.\"Britain's move has also irked some across the channel. Peter Lieske, who speaks on health policy for the Christian Democrats in the European Parliament, said the approval was \"hasty.\" The European Medicines Agency is due to discuss vaccine approvals at the end of the month and in January.Trump once saw the vaccine as a route to a second term. After losing the election, he's seeking victory laps wherever he can find them. Yet the vaccine process ought to be about more than claiming political credit. And US vaccines are expected to be approved within weeks anyway. In fact, a methodical process of approval is actually a good sign \u2014 given that millions of Americans are skeptical of a vaccine that will end the pandemic. But politicians \u2014 who have spent months delivering bad news and been criticized for lackluster crisis management \u2014 dreamed of the day they could announce deliverance is at hand.The ultra-competitive Trump is mad that he didn't get to go first.",

(CNN)President-elect Joe Biden's hopes of reviving the Iran nuclear deal may already be coming undone.The assassination last week of nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, apparently in a covert operation featuring a remote-controlled machine gun --was a new blow to Iranian pride following the US killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in a January airstrike. Both incidents could wreck prospects for diplomacy.Tehran's clerical leaders now have a conundrum. Do they respond aggressively -- against the country accused of perpetrating the attack, Israel -- and risk a damaging escalation with the United States? Or do they absorb the politically embarrassing blow and hope dialogue with Biden could ease Trump administration sanctions that have strangled their economy?President Donald Trump would likely respond to Iranian military action. And a conflict would not just hand Biden an immediate crisis, it also would probably kill off any talks between Washington and Tehran. That is one reason why Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has always opposed the nuclear deal, might have ordered the Fakhrizadeh attack.US hawks claim Trump's \"maximum pressure policy\" has handed Biden new leverage in negotiating with Iran after Trump pulled out of an Obama-era nuclear deal in 2018 that even US intelligence said Iran was respecting. But since then, Tehran has accumulated 12 times the amount of low enriched uranium permitted under the 2015 deal, according to a UN report in November, and is closer to the point at which it could break out toward a nuclear bomb. US sanctions, while inflicting terrible economic pain, show no sign of catalyzing the regime change hoped for by Trump's hardliners. Read MoreEven if Biden is willing to return to the terms of the Iran nuclear deal, the case for diplomacy has been weakened by the Trump-ordered US strike that killed Soleimani. And how could pragmatists sell a new deal with the US that a future Republican President would likely ditch? An Iranian election next year, meanwhile, could deliver a new hardline president who opposes dialogue with the US.So critics of the deal in the US and Israel may well make it impossible for Biden to work with Iran. That will leave future US presidents with an awful choice \u2014 between living with the possibility of an Iranian bomb or ordering military action that could start a disastrous new war in the Middle East.The Covid bowlPlaying American football without a quarterback is almost as pointless as playing without a pigskin. But the Denver Broncos played with one hand behind their backs Sunday when their quarterbacks were ruled out of their game against the New Orleans Saints after being flagged as high-risk Covid-19 contacts and forced into quarantine. Not surprisingly, saddled with a rookie wide receiver in the crucial role that carries out complicated pre-drawn plays and sometimes changes tactics on the fly -- the Broncos lost 31-3. Their plight is the most extreme manifestation of the worsening pandemic's impact on the league, but there are so many incidents that doubts are growing that the NFL will make it to the Super Bowl early next year.The Baltimore Ravens thrice had a Thanksgiving game against the Pittsburgh Steelers called off. They are due to play Wednesday but could be without more than 20 players ruled out by positive Covid tests. The San Francisco 49s must now play in Arizona after officials in their home Santa Clara County banned contact sports amid a Covid spike. The Saints have been stripped of a draft pick and fined $500,000 for not wearing masks in the locker room.The NFL, which is a massive, television-driven business as well as America's favorite sport, has not opted to play its games in the kind of bio-secure bubble that helped NBA basketball and NHL hockey finish their delayed seasons. The NBA will face similar challenges in a nation wracked by out-of-control Covid cases when it comes back at Christmas playing in teams' home cities. The NHL, targeting an early 2021 puck drop, is mulling a unique Canadian division since the closed border with the US will make international travel impossible.Hopefully, by the time the NFL returns next September for its 2021 season, the promise of Covid-19 vaccines will have been fulfilled and will mean that playing and going to games will again be a ritual that everyone will take for granted.'The virus is not red or blue'The Rev. Raphael Warnock -- a Democratic candidate in one of two US Senate runoff elections in Georgia in January, which will decide which party controls the Senate -- on Monday bemoaned how even the coronavirus pandemic is viewed through a partisan lens.\"It's unfortunate that this virus has become a political issue. The virus is not red or blue. And the things that we need to do should be based on science and not on politics. ... For me it's as basic as love your neighbor. Love your neighbor, love your country, love yourself. Socially distance, wear a mask, wash your hands,\" Warnock said.Trumps' last Christmas at the White HouseDespite her scathing assessment in recently released audiotapes of hosting the festive season at the White House (in which she commented, \"who gives a f* about the Christmas stuff\"), first lady Melania Trump wants it to be known she was the driving force behind decking the halls of the presidential mansion with boughs of holly this year.The theme for what, to quote George Michael, is the Trumps' \"Last Christmas\" at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. is \"America the Beautiful.\"CNN's Betsy Klein reports that highlights this year include a tribute to essential workers in the Red Room, including a light-up ceramic post office, and a tree with ornaments celebrating front-line workers, including a trash truck, scientist, caregiver, lab coat and nurse hat.A military aide walks between Christmas decorations in the East Wing of the White House on Monday.A more intimate scene in the Red RoomThis is the scene that will greet guests in the Cross Hall and the Blue Room in the Trump White House at Christmas parties that are still expected to take place despite the pandemic.",

        "content": "Istanbul (CNN)Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has slammed the decision by a major European human rights group to begin infringement proceedings against Ankara over its failure to free Osman Kavala, a Turkish businessman and philanthropist who has been behind bars for more than four years. Erdogan accused the rights group, the Council of Europe, of ignoring its sovereignty on Thursday, saying: \"We do not recognize those who do not recognize our courts. We expect our own courts to be respected. We are sorry but we will not respect those who do not respect us.\" In October, Erdogan ordered the ambassadors of 10 countries, including the United States, France and Germany, to be declared persona non grata after calling for Kavala's release.Kavala is among Turkey's most high-profile detainees. He was first arrested in 2017 on charges related to the 2013 Gezi Park protests in Istanbul. The trial was closely watched by rights groups, who had accused the Turkish government of using the judicial system to crack down on dissenting voices. Though Kavala was acquitted in 2020, that verdict was overturned and new charges were brought against him for his alleged involvement in the 2016 attempted coup.Turkey's president has ordered 10 ambassadors to be declared 'persona non grata' for backing jailed activistThe Council of Europe said in a Wednesday statement its decision to move forward with infringement proceedings against Turkey, a founding member of the organization, \"clearly indicates the serious concerns related with the case of Mr. Kavala, who has been kept in prison for years without a conviction.\" Read More\"Such attitude sets a worrying precedent and further increases the EU's concerns regarding Turkish judiciary's adherence to international and European standards,\" it said.The European Court of Human Rights had previously ruled that Kavala's detention \"took place in the absence of sufficient evidence\" and ordered his release. Kavala has denied the charges levied against him. His lawyer, lkan Koyuncu, said Thursday that espionage charges leveled against Kavala were \"fabricated.\" \"Osman Kavala's pre-trial detention for four years and three months is a disgrace to the judiciary,\" Koyuncu said. Rights groups like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International applauded the Council's decision. \"The message from the Committee of Ministers today is clear: Turkey must release Osman Kavala and end his politically motivated persecution,\" Nils Mui\u017enieks, Amnesty International's Europe director, said in a statement Wednesday.",

Kabas used traditional Turkish proverbs to make references to Erdogan without actually giving the President's name. \"A crowned head gets wiser, but we see that it is not true,\" she said in reference to Erdogan's nearly 20 years in power since becoming prime minister then president.

However, it was unclear when the decision would be implemented.Death sentence of Saudi man jailed as a teen for anti-government protests is commutedThe decree was not published in official Saudi state media.At the time of the announcement, there were hopes the decree could potentially spare several men from the country's Shia minority, who allegedly committed crimes as minors, from the death penalty. Ali al-Nimr, an imprisoned anti-government protester, was the most prominent of these. The nephew of the executed firebrand cleric Nimr al-Nimr, Ali was arrested at the age of 17 and given a death sentence. That sentence was commuted in February this year, his father told CNN. Ali al-Nimr's sentence was reduced to 10 years in jail by the Specialized Criminal Court, according to Reprieve.In 2019, CNN reported on Saudi teen Murtaja Qureiris, who faced the death penalty for crimes he allegedly committed at the age of 13. The anti-government protester was spared execution after the report spurred an international outcry.Detained since 2018, now Saudi women's rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul is handed a 5-year sentenceSPA quoted the Saudi Ministry of Interior as saying al-Darwish \"launched an armed revolt against the ruler and destabilized security in this country by forming a terrorist network with the aim of killing security personnel, causing riots, provoking chaos, sectarian strife, making bombs with the intention of the breach with some members of that cell.\" According to Amnesty International, al-Darwish had only attended anti-government protests in 2011 and 2012. Amnesty International said that during his detention, al-Darwish \"was placed in solitary confinement for six months and denied access to a lawyer for two years until the beginning of his trial, violating his right to a fair trial.\"\"By carrying out this execution, the Saudi Arabian authorities have displayed a deplorable disregard for the right to life. He is the latest victim of Saudi Arabia's deeply flawed justice system, which regularly sees people sentenced to death after grossly unfair trials based on confessions extracted through torture,\" Amnesty added in its statement.",

        "content": "(CNN)Iran has informed the international nuclear watchdog that it intends to massively ramp up its levels of uranium enrichment following an apparent attack on a nuclear site in the country over the weekend. On Tuesday, Iran's deputy foreign minister and a top nuclear negotiator Abbas Araghchi told state-run Press TV that the International Atomic Energy Organization (IAEA) had been informed of Tehran's decision to ramp up enrichment to 60% purity, a big step up from the current 20% purity levels.The decision pushes Iran closer to reaching the 90% enrichment level that is considered weapons-grade. Iran has continually denied it intends to assemble nuclear weapons.The Biden administration said Tuesday that Iran's intention to enrich uranium up to 60% purity was a \"provocative announcement\" that both \"calls into question Iran's seriousness with regard to the nuclear talks and underscores the imperative of returning to mutual compliance with the JCPOA.\"White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at a briefing the United States \"(takes) seriously\" Tehran's announcement, which the permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany, known as the P5+1, \"should be unified in rejecting.\"Read MoreThe office of the French President Emmanuel Macron called the announcement a \"grave development\" that calls for a \"coordinated response.\"France is one of the signatories of the 2015 nuclear deal which put strict limits on Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanction relief.The announcement came just days after a blackout at Iran's Natanz nuclear site, an underground facility where uranium enrichment takes place. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif accused Israel of sabotaging the facility and vowed to take revenge.  Mysterious blackout in Iran threatens to undermine nuclear talksIn keeping with usual practice, Israel has given no official comment on the Natanz incident, though Israel's army chief hinted at possible Israeli involvement in the attack in comments on Sunday. Several Israeli media outlets, quoting unnamed intelligence sources, said Mossad, the national intelligence agency, was behind the operation but offered no other details.On Tuesday, Iran's semi-official news agency Mehr reported that Iran will add 1,000 centrifuges with 50% more capacity to the Natanz facility, in addition to replacing the ones damaged during the incident on Sunday.Kazem Gharibabadi, Iran's permanent representative to the UN atomic agency, announced that a new generation of machines will be installed in the Natanz nuclear facility and several other technical measures will be also announced this week, Mehr reported.Gharibabadi later added that Iran expects to \"accumulate\" enriched uranium next week. \"Enriching UF6 up to 60% will be done in two cascades of IR-4 and IR-6 centrifuges in Natanz. Modification of the process just started and we expect to accumulate the product next week. This will improve significantly both the quality and quantity of radiopharmaceutical products,\" he said in a tweet.Earlier on Tuesday, an Iranian MP and head of the Parliament Research Center (IPRC), Ali Zakani, told the Iranian state-run channel, IRIB, that thousands of centrifuges had been damaged in the attack on Natanz.Iran has agreed to keep enrichment levels to under 3.67% under the 2015 nuclear deal, known as JCPOA, it signed with the United States and other world powers. Gradual increasingIn July 2019, the Iranian government announced it was increasing enrichment beyond that level, following the decision of then-US President Donald Trump to withdraw from the deal and re-introduce economic sanctions in 2018.Iran's President Hassan Rouhani (L) visits Nuclear Technology exhibition in Tehran, Iran on April 10, 2021.In January this year, Iran announced it would resume enriching uranium to 20% purity.Last week, Iranian representatives met with officials from the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China -- the other signatories to the nuclear deal -- in Vienna to discuss a way forward on how to resuscitate the 2015 deal. US officials were also in Vienna to meet with the other signatories, but did not meet directly with Iranian officials.  Psaki said the Biden administration's objective is a return to \"mutual compliance with the JCPOA with Iran.\"\"We have been engaged constructively, in what we felt was constructive dialogue last week, even as it was indirect, in Vienna,\" Psaki said at the briefing on Tuesday.\"While they were difficult and while we expect this to be long, we expect and we have not been alerted of any change in planned attendance in the meetings that will resume later this week,\" she continued. \"So, we are certainly concerned about these provocative announcements, but our goal remains seeing through a diplomatic process which we expect to resume in Vienna later this week.\"The talks were scheduled to take place Wednesday, but have been delayed by a day by a positive Covid-19 test in one of the negotiating teams, Iran's semi-official ISNA news agency reported Tuesday. CNN's Saskya Vandoorne and Arnaud Siad contributed reporting.",

        "content": "New York (CNN Business)A new children's book called \"Doctor Li and The Crown-Wearing Virus\" is the origin story of Doctor Li Wenliang, who first raised the alarm that a novel coronavirus was spreading in Wuhan, China.The police tried to silence Li, but he continued to speak out. In the book, a 7-year-old, May, learns about Doctor Li's courage and she takes action to cultivate hope.The illustrated book was written by the New York Times best-selling author Francesca Cavallo. It was first made available as a short, downloadable book for free. The online version was downloaded more than 60,000 times in just a couple of weeks and later translated by volunteers into 38 languages. Cavallo told CNN she believes she received so many requests from parents and educators for the print version of this book because they wanted to give children a better explanation of deeper events during the pandemic. So she chose not to wait to write a longer version of the book. Dr. Li died on February 7, 2020, from coronavirus. Cavallo said that \"he became a symbol of freedom, of the importance of science, so the fact that he was featured in a children's book was a hugely important way to preserve his memory.\"Read MoreCavallo also worried about the increase in racism toward Asian-Americans and thought many kids would forever associate the virus with China -- and Chinese people.\"I didn't want those kids to associate an Asian face with the virus,\" Cavallo told CNN. \"That's the kind of racism that's extremely hard to eradicate when you grow up. I wanted them to associate the face of Doctor Li with the face of the first hero of this pandemic.\"After launching a crowdfunding campaign, Cavallo and her team were able to raise more than $52,000 funds in less than a month through Kickstarter and published the book in November. It sold more than 15,000 worldwide with copies in English, Italian, simplified Chinese and Pilipino. Cavallo said the book inspires children to be brave in the face of adversity, adding that \"it also celebrates empathy by showing kids what this crisis means for everyone and will offer you and your children. [It provides] a space to explore their feelings about the pandemic and an opportunity to be inspired and to make sense of what happened together.\"The book is being sold directly online and some publishers around the world are distributing it in the Philippines, Italy and Singapore.Cavallo also recently closed a distribution deal. Starting July 2021, Undercats' books will be distributed in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, which could allow \"Doctor Li and The Crown-Wearing Virus\" to reach millions around the world.",

        "content": "Ottawa (CNN)Multiple criminal investigations have been opened in connection to the \"desecration\" of Canada's National War Memorial among other incidents during weekend protests in Ottawa against mandates for Covid-19 vaccines and other public health measures. \"Several criminal investigations are underway in relation to the desecration of the National War Memorial/Terry Fox statute, threatening/illegal/intimidating behavior to police/city workers and other individuals and damage to a city vehicle,\" the Ottawa Police Service tweeted Sunday. This weekend's protests grew out of the \"Freedom Convoy\" that made its way through Canada for several days before arriving in Ottawa on Saturday. It began as a protest by truckers opposed to vaccine requirements, before gaining followers calling for an end to other Covid-19 mandates as well. The mandate, which took effect January 15, requires truckers entering Canada to be fully vaccinated or face testing and quarantine requirements, though Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters last week that 90% of the country's truckers were already vaccinated (Trudeau's office has not disclosed the location of the prime minister, whose family lives about a mile from Parliament Hill). Vehicles from the protest are parked, blocking lanes on a road, on Sunday, January 30, in Ottawa.Ottawa police were working with protest organizers Sunday evening \"to facilitate the safe departure\" of people and vehicles from the downtown core where protests were focused.Read MorePolice observed \"multiple cases of disruptive, inappropriate and threatening behavior from demonstrators,\" and are aware of demonstrators' intention to stay in place through the week, a statement from the Ottawa Police Service said.Police avoided ticketing and towing vehicles \"so as not to instigate confrontations with demonstrators,\" but confrontations and the need for de-escalation has regularly occurred between police and demonstrators, according to the statement.The agency estimated the financial costs of policing around the demonstrations was more than $800,000 a day.On Saturday, the protests were generally peaceful, police said -- but noisy. The sound of horns honking was heard throughout the capital, though many demonstrators were concentrated in the downtown core, causing traffic in and around Parliament Hill and prompting city officials to ask residents to avoid the area due to gridlock. And while temperatures reached only 8 degrees Fahrenheit, the cold did not stop crowds from joining the convoy on foot or greeting them with Canadian flags on bridges and highway overpasses. No arrests were reported by the Ottawa Police Service on Saturday and overnight. But there were incidents that prompted condemnation by officials such as Canada's chief of defense, Gen. Wayne Eyre, who said he was \"sickened to see protesters dance on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and desecrate the National War Memorial.\"\"Generations of Canadians have fought and died for our rights, including free speech, but not this,\" Eyre tweeted Saturday. \"Those involved should hang their heads in shame.\"A similar denunciation also came from the Canadian Trucking Alliance, a federation of Canadian trucking associations, which had already said a large number protesters in Ottawa appeared to have no connection the trucking industry. Protesters against Covid-19 vaccine mandates and restrictions are seen in front of Parliament on Saturday in Ottawa.\"The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and the National War Memorial are sacred sites for Canadians. The desecration of these sites was a disgusting act and is a dishonour to those soldiers who have given their lives for our country and those Canadian soldiers who continue to fight for our freedom today,\" the CTA said in a statement. It went on to call Terry Fox, the late athlete and cancer research activist, a \"national hero.\" The defacing of Fox's monument was another insult to \"the memory of one of the greatest Canadians in our history,\" the federation said. One photo retweeted by James Moore, Canada's former minister of innovation, science and industry, showed the statue holding an upside-down Canadian flag and a sign that read, \"Mandate Freedom.\" Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson called the display \"completely unacceptable,\" saying he'd asked for the sign and flag to be taken down. \"This kind of stunt by protesters does not help their cause,\" the mayor said.Trucks and cars still lined the streets in Ottawa's downtown core Sunday morning, and again, protesters showed no signs of leaving despite a frostbite warning with temperatures as low as -4 degrees Fahrenheit. Ottawa police promised a \"very large police presence\" Sunday and said national monuments would be fortified and protected. Barricades were installed to \"block any vehicular access to the path in front of the National War Memorial.\"\"The OPS and our partners continue to focus on keeping the peace in and around the demonstrations and maintaining emergency access lanes while addressing any threatening high-risk behaviour,\" Ottawa police said in a statement Sunday morning. People who work in Ottawa's downtown core are advised to work remotely Monday and parents should check if schools in the area will be open, police said Sunday night.CNN's Paula Newton reported from Ottawa, and Dakin Andone and Keith Allen reported and wrote in Atlanta.

        "content": "(CNN)Sarah Weddington, an attorney in the landmark Roe v. Wade case, has died, according to statements from friend and former student Susan Hays and US Rep. Lloyd Doggett. She was 76.Born in Abilene, Texas, in 1945, Weddington attended McMurry University before graduating from the University of Texas School of Law in 1967.Just five years later, she helped represent Norma McCorvey, known in court documents as Jane Roe, before the Supreme Court in the case that affirmed the legality of a woman's right to have an abortion and would go on to become among the most consequential and contested in US history.McCorvey had filed a case against Henry Wade, then-district attorney of Dallas County, because he had enforced a Texas law that prohibited abortion, except to save a woman's life. In 1971, the high court agreed to hear the case against Wade, who was enforcing the Texas abortion law that had been declared unconstitutional in an earlier federal district court case. Wade was ignoring the legal ruling and both sides appealed.Read MoreThe Supreme Court would ultimately side with McCorvey in a 7-2 decision that affirmed the legality of a woman's right to have an abortion under the 14th Amendment to the Constitution.Weddington went on to serve in the Texas House of Representatives and later as general counsel for the US Department of Agriculture and an assistant to President Jimmy Carter. She was also a professor at University of Texas at Austin for 28 years, where she taught courses on leadership and gender-based discrimination.Carter remembered Weddington in a statement Monday morning, saying she \"was a warrior in the continuing struggle for equal rights for women. She dedicated her life to that mission and was a leading force for these rights in my administration. Rosalynn and I add our voices to those who mourn her passing.\"Weddington died in her sleep at her Austin home early Sunday morning and had been battling health issues for some time, Hays said. A cause of death was not immediately available.\"While rightfully known for her remarkable victory and continued advocacy for reproductive freedom, I knew Sarah as a friend and fellow legislator who worked effectively for Austin,\" Doggett, a Democrat from Texas, said in a statement Sunday night.\"Her passion for reproductive freedom was matched by her compassion for our neighbors. She shows the tremendous impact that one determined woman can make,\" Doggett added.  Weddington's death comes as the Supreme Court reconsiders the right she helped win nearly 50 years ago. Earlier this month, the high court seemed poised to uphold a Mississippi law that bars abortion after 15 weeks, with narrow exceptions. While it is less clear if there's a majority to end the right to abortion nationwide, the court's conservative justices expressed skepticism about the landmark Roe v. Wade decision.Weddington spent decades warning about threats to abortion access. \"Since those euphoric days of the 1970s when we won landmark freedoms for women, attacks on Roe have been relentless,\" she wrote in a 2012 afterword to her 1992 book \"A Question of Choice.\"Still, she said at the time, \"It makes me happy to watch as those younger people join our cause\" and that \"my generation will do all that's possible to support their efforts and, increasingly from the sidelines, we will be cheering for them and wishing them success.\"\"Many of those who worked before the Roe v. Wade decision to make that decision possible are still determined to work for its principles, but age has simultaneously made them more tired. The torch will be passing to women and sympathetic men who believe that women are the appropriate people to make the basic decisions that determine the lives of women,\" Weddington wrote. \"It will be on their shoulders to turn back the fanatical forces of the right.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)An Atlanta-area man accused of stabbing a police officer during an attempted burglary last week has also been charged with murder in connection with the deaths of a firefighter and his wife, officials say.Matthew Scott Lanz, 22, was arrested Friday in Sandy Springs, Georgia, after allegedly stabbing a police officer, who was responding to a burglary in progress, according to a news release from the Sandy Springs Police Department (SSPD.) Officers discovered Lanz inside the residence when they arrived and a confrontation ensued, the release said. Officers unsuccessfully attempted to subdue Lanz by using a Taser on him, it said, and that's when Lanz repeatedly stabbed one of the responding officers.\"A back-up officer who witnessed the attack, shot the suspect in an attempt to stop the stabbing. The injured Officer was rushed to a local hospital where he received treatment for his multiple wounds,\" the release reads. The injured officer was later released from the hospital, according to an update tweeted by SSPD Saturday.Lanz was also sent to an area hospital following the shooting, officials said.Read MoreLanz had no connection to the neighborhood where the burglary took place and did not know the homeowners, police said.According to SSPD, Lanz is the brother of Austin William Lanz, the man who the FBI said fatally stabbed a Pentagon police officer on August 3, before taking his own life with the officer's service weapon. Couple killed in their homeLanz was later identified as the suspect in the murder of a husband and wife on Thursday in Acworth, where he lives, according to a press release from the Cobb County Police Department. Acworth is about 25 miles northwest of Sandy Springs. Cobb County Police identified the victims as Timothy Justin Hicks, 31, and his wife Amber Hicks, 31. The fire department in nearby Cherokee County confirmed on its Facebook page that Hicks had been a firefighter with the department for more than six years. The couple was found dead in their home from gunshot wounds. Cobb County police said a 2-year-old was also in the home but was unharmed. Investigators said in the release that the incident appeared to have happened overnight, but they did not give a specific timeline.  Lanz faces two counts of felony murder and multiple other charges, including home invasion, aggravated assault, weapons possession, and attempted murder in connection with the two incidents, according to SSPD. In Cobb County, the release states he is being charged with two counts of felony murder, two counts of aggravated assault, home invasion, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.CNN has reached out to Lanz's court-appointed attorney for comment but has not heard back. Lanz was transferred to Fulton County Jail after he was released from the hospital, both SSPD and Cobb County said in their releases. He is still in custody, according to jail records. Court records show he made his first court appearance Friday. His next court date has not been posted yet.",

        "content": "(CNN)Authorities in Wisconsin have identified the driver of a red SUV who they say intentionally drove his SUV through barricades and into a crowd celebrating the Waukesha Christmas parade.Darrell E. Brooks Jr., 39, is believed to have acted alone Sunday and is the only suspect, Waukesha Police Chief Dan Thompson said Monday. Brooks faces five counts of first-degree intentional homicide, with additional charges based on the investigation, Thompson said.Brooks had been released from jail less than two weeks ago in a domestic abuse case, on a $1,000 bail that prosecutors recommended and now say was \"inappropriately low.\" Brooks will have his initial court appearance at 4 p.m. CT Tuesday at which initial charges will be filed, according to a statement from the Waukesha County District Attorney's Office. The hearing will be available via livestream for the public to view.\"We are working closely with the City of Waukesha Police Department to review the matter and decide what criminal charges will be issued,\" read the statement. Read MoreThompson said Brooks was involved in a domestic disturbance with another person just prior to driving his SUV through the parade Sunday afternoon. Police were not able to respond to the initial call about the domestic incident because they had to respond to the parade so quickly after receiving the call, the chief said.Police stressed there was no police pursuit leading up to the incident. What we know about what happened at the Wisconsin Christmas paradeThompson said there is no information that Brooks knew anyone in the parade.  Five people were killed in the incident. They ranged from age 52 to 81 years old, Thompson said.The city identified the victims as:Virginia Sorenson, 79LeAnna Owen, 71 Tamara Durand, 52 Jane Kulich, 52 Wilhelm Hospel, 81 The police chief acknowledged the heroism of onlookers at the scene, saying first responders and residents worked together to triage the victims and get them as stable as possible.He said officers and citizens took victims to the hospital in their personal vehicles.At least 18 children were hospitalized after the parade, said Children's Wisconsin, a pediatric hospital in nearby Milwaukee.Thompson said the incident is not a terrorist event. The crash also does not appear to be connected to the recent verdict in the Kyle Rittenhouse trial in Kenosha, Wisconsin, according to multiple law enforcement sources familiar with preliminary investigation findings.Suspect had been released on bail from earlier incident, DA saysBrooks was released on $1,000 bail earlier this month, according to court records and the Milwaukee County District Attorney's office, which said in a statement that the bail had been set \"inappropriately low.\"Brooks posted the bail on November 11 in relation to charges including domestic abuse. The charges stemmed from a November 2 incident in which Brooks is accused of running over a woman with his car while she was walking through a gas station parking lot, according to a criminal complaint. Darrell Brooks in a November 3 booking photo.\"Officers observed tire tracks on her left pants leg,\" the criminal complaint read.Prosecutors filed five charges related to the incident including: obstructing an officer, second-degree recklessly endangering safety with domestic abuse assessments, disorderly conduct with domestic abuse assessments and misdemeanor battery with domestic abuse assessments.Brooks was also charged with bail jumping, because he was already out on bail following a July 24, 2020, incident, according to court documents.In a statement, the Milwaukee DA's office now says it should not have recommended such a low bail for Brooks and have launched an internal review into the decision.\"The State's bail recommendation in this case was inappropriately low in light of the nature of the recent charges and the pending charges against Mr. Brooks,\" the office's statement said. \"The bail recommendation in this case is not consistent with the approach of the Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office toward matters involving violent crime, nor was it consistent with the risk assessment of the defendant prior to setting of bail.\"CNN reached out to Brooks' attorney from the 2020 and earlier November 2021 incident about the DA's statement, but has not yet received a response.Here's what we know about the suspect in the Waukesha parade tragedyWith the 2020 incident, Brooks is accused of firing a handgun during an argument, according to a charging complaint. While arresting Brooks, authorities say they found a stolen handgun and three \"multicolored pills,\" which later tested \"presumptively positive\" for methamphetamines.Brooks was charged with two counts of second-degree reckless endangering safety while using of a dangerous weapon and one count of possession of a firearm by a felon.Bail had initially been set at $10,000 in that case but because Brooks had asked for a speedy jury trial, which could not be met, bail was reduced to $500. Brooks was released on bail in that case on February 21, according to the district attorney's office.Brooks has an outstanding arrest warrant in Nevada in an unrelated case for which he was arrested and jumped bail, authorities said. CNN has reached out to a previous attorney for Brooks with no response.  Authorities in Nevada issued an active warrant on Brooks on August 15, 2016, for jumping bail, according to Sarah Johns, Washoe County Sheriff's Office spokesperson. Johns said detectives later determined Brooks was in Wisconsin. \"However, detectives did not have viable intelligence on Brooks' exact location.\"How the disaster unfoldedFamilies, including children in strollers, bundled up in the chilly wind and lined the parade route on Main Street. The city's live stream of the parade showed a marching band had just started playing \"Jingle Bells\" when a red SUV barreled into the parade from behind.

        "content": "(CNN)The accidental discharge of a passenger's weapon in a security area of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport caused widespread panic Saturday afternoon, prompting a brief halt of departing flights over the busy travel weekend. The incident occurred around 1:30 p.m. ET when a \"prohibited item\" was detected in a passenger's property while going through the X-ray screening at the security checkpoint, Robert Spinden, the Transportation Security Administration's federal security director for Georgia, said in a news conference. The property was flagged for a \"secondary search,\" he said. \"During that secondary search, the passenger lunged into his property, grabbing a firearm that was located inside, which ultimately discharged,\" Spinden said. \"The passenger then fled the security checkpoint through an adjacent exit lane with his firearm.\" \"We're fortunate that when the firearm went off, nobody was seriously injured,\" Spinden said.Three people suffered non-life-threatening injuries, the TSA said in a statement. Atlanta police had previously said no injuries were reported. Read MoreAccording to a source familiar with the situation, the injured were not shot but instead hurt during the evacuation. All of the injured were adults, the source said, and two were transported to the hospital. The discharged round went into the property of the person who brought the weapon, the source said.How to fly safer this holiday seasonThe individual whose weapon was discharged was identified as 42-year-old Kenny Wells, according to Atlanta Police Department Airport Precinct Commander Reginald L. Moorman.\"We have taken out warrants for carrying concealed a weapon at a commercial airport, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, discharging a firearm and reckless conduct,\" Moorman said. \"We are actively pursuing this individual.\"Airports spokesperson Andrew Gobeil characterized the discharge as accidental and said the loud noise created a \"sense of chaos.\"Airport officials and Atlanta Police know who the individual is, Gobeil told CNN's Jim Acosta, because the incident occurred while the passenger was being screened. Kenny WellsErika Zeidler, who was traveling from Atlanta to Anchorage, Alaska, said she was sitting in a restaurant in Concourse T when people began running down the hallway. \"We thought they were late for a flight, and then more and more people started running,\" she told Acosta. \"There was some screaming and then somebody stopped and said, 'There's a shooter, you need to go.'\"An investigation into the incident remains ongoing, Gobeil said. In the meantime, there is no danger to passengers or employees, airport officials said on Twitter. Officials gave an \"all-clear,\" and the airport was resuming normal operations.A ground stop was called for the airport for all departing flights, per the Federal Aviation Administration, but was soon lifted.Details about the weapon or circumstances surrounding the accidental discharge have not been made available.The FBI and the ATF are \"providing investigative assistance\" to the Atlanta police, according to a spokesperson for the ATF. The White House is also \"monitoring\" the incident, a White House official said, referring questions to local law enforcement.The shooting scare comes as the Thanksgiving travel period is getting underway. On Friday, TSA screened more than 2.2 million airport travelers across the country -- the highest checkpoint volume for a single day since the pandemic began, according to a TSA spokesperson.Travelers stand inside the Atlanta airport's domestic terminal after an accidental weapon discharge caused chaos and panic Saturday, November 20, 2021.Witnesses recount chaos after scareWitnesses described confusion and disarray as panic erupted in one of the world's busiest airports.

Another video shared by Stepho\u0144 Stafford -- who said he was about to go through security with his child -- showed disorder inside, with a number of stanchions knocked over where people had previously been waiting in line.Greg Romero had just gotten off a flight from Salt Lake City when he heard there was an emergency, he told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield. Airport personnel \"shut off all the escalators and cut off all passengers and turned off the tram,\" said Romero, the father-in-law of CNN correspondent Nadia Romero.\"Right now airport personnel is doing a really good job keeping everybody calm,\" he added. A few travelers were \"a little bit panicked but more frustrated,\" Romero said. \"They're trying to catch flights, to get out of the airport. For the most part, people are just lined up against the walls.\" A still image taken from a video shared by a witness shows airport stanchions knocked over where passengers were previously waiting in line.Dianne Callahan was traveling with her son and had just boarded her flight to New York when the crew closed the door to the plane. That's when she said she heard screams outside the plane. She also heard sirens, Callahan said, but didn't know what was going on. \"It was an extremely tense situation,\" she said. \"People were pushing to get on the plane that were not even on our flight. That's how scared they were.\" Callahan and her son were then sent to go back through security, she said. In response to the incident, Delta Air Lines, which is headquartered in Atlanta, announced it was issuing a travel waiver to assist impacted customers. \"With this, the fare difference for customers will be waived when rebooked travel occurs on or before Nov. 23, 2021, in the same cabin of service as originally booked,\" the statement said. \"Delta is coordinating with TSA and Atlanta airport officials to accommodate customers as quickly and safely as possible,\" the airline said. \"We are also working to proactively accommodate customers who may have missed a flight.\"Firearms being found at airport checkpoints is 'huge problem,' per TSATSA Administrator David Pekoske recently told CNN that airline passengers bringing guns to the airport is a \"huge problem.\" Last month, the agency reported catching 4,650 firearms -- a majority of them loaded -- at security checkpoints in the first 10 months of 2021. That number surpassed the full-year record of 4,432, set in 2019. According to the TSA's statement Saturday, 450 firearms have been detected at the Atlanta airport's checkpoints alone in 2021. \"You cannot take a loaded firearm or an unloaded firearm through the security checkpoint at any airport in the country,\" Page Pate, a Georgia criminal defense attorney and constitutional lawyer, told CNN's Pamela Brown. Generally, a fine that can be several thousand dollars would be imposed under federal regulations, Pate said.'Huge problem': Passengers are bringing a record number of guns to the airport, TSA says\"It can also be referred for criminal prosecution to the state where the airport is,\" Pate said. \"But in Georgia, if you have a carry permit, the security staff just needs to notify you that you've left a gun in your bag, and then you just take it out of the airport. So you're rarely prosecuted for doing something like this, especially in Georgia, which has very pro-gun right-type legislation on the books.\"Saturday's incident \"underscores the importance of checking personal belongings for dangerous items before leaving the airport,\" the TSA said. \"Firearms, particularly loaded firearms, introduce an unnecessary risk at checkpoints,\" the agency said, \"have no place in the passenger cabin of an airplane, and represent a very costly mistake for the passengers who attempt to board a flight with them.\" CNN's Pete Muntean, Melissa Alonso, Nadia Romero and Ray Sanchez contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)A crowd surge at a Houston music festival on Friday crushed concertgoers as they were left trampled and gasping for air, struggling to survive against a wall of people pressing forward toward the stage. Police are investigating the potential causes of the surge, which occurred at the Astroworld Festival at NRG Park and led to the deaths of eight people as well as many more injured. The show continued for 40 minutes after initial reports of spectators being harmed reached first responders.As authorities piece together the moments before and after the surge, here's a timeline of what happened, according to officials, witness accounts and CNN reporting: Before the show: Earlier in the day, video from CNN affiliate KPRC showed numerous people rushing through a VIP entrance at the event -- knocking over metal detectors and other people as well as ignoring security staff.JUST WATCHED'Some kind of crowd surge': Crowds seen pushing through entrances earlierReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'Some kind of crowd surge': Crowds seen pushing through entrances earlier 01:15The video showed some people helping a few others up. Houston Fire Chief Sam Pe\u00f1a told CNN he didn't know what caused the rush, either.Read More\"We do know that we had people jump the fence,\" and at least one person was injured in the afternoon rush, Pe\u00f1a said.CNN asked Pe\u00f1a whether the instance led to special precautions at this year's event. \"It's obvious that if they did, they weren't enough,\" Pe\u00f1a responded.Houston Police Chief Troy Finner visited rapper Travis Scott, the headliner of the festival who also acted as an event organizer, before his set to express \"concerns about the energy in the crowd,\" according to reporting from The New York Times citing a source familiar with the chief's account. CNN has reached out to Houston police and representatives for Travis Scott for comment on The New York Times report.Before 9 p.m. Central Time: Madeline Eskins, an ICU nurse attending the show, told CNN's Christi Paul a countdown timer began around 30 minutes before Scott was set to appear on stage. \"And all of a sudden, people compressed up against each other and were pushing forward and backward. As the timer got closer to coming down to zero, it just -- it got worse and worse,\" Eskins said.Concertgoer Jeffrey Schmidt said breathing became more difficult as the countdown moved closer to zero, as he and his friend decided to try and get out of the crowd.\"Little did we know, all hell was about to break loose. People started to pass out and fall to the ground,\" Schmidt told CNN.Just after 9 p.m.: Scott took the stage to begin his set. The crowd surged forward as the show began, according to one concertgoer.\"The crowd became tighter and tighter, and at that point it was hard to breathe. When Travis came out performing his first song, I witnessed people passing out next to me,\" TK Tellez said.Sarai Sierra, who went to the festival to celebrate her birthday, said she saw multiple people who could not breathe after Scott appeared on stage.\"I truly thought that if I fell it would've been the end of me. I spent at least 15 minutes just getting pushed around due to mosh pits or simply because people were 'raging,'\" Sierra said.9:30 p.m.: Officials first receive reports of people falling injured in the crowd, according to Pe\u00f1a, and said they \"requested additional resources to the scene.\"Finner said Saturday at a press conference \"our people stepped up and immediately went to the producers and told them, 'Hey, people are going down.'\" An empty stage is seen at the 2021 Astroworld Festival days after a stampede killed at least eight people in Houston9:38 p.m.:  A \"mass casualty event\" was officially declared, Pe\u00f1a said.\"From the time that the mass casualty incident was declared, to the first unit on scene, was two minutes when we began to make patient contact,\" he said.Witnesses describe calling out for help but being unable to be heard over the music.'This was not a concert, this was a fight for survival'\"Travis Scott would have a short time in between songs, and we would scream our vocal cords out, so someone could hear us but nobody did,\" Tellez said. \"This year's festival will be stuck with me forever. I've never seen someone die in front of my eyes. It was horrific.\"Scott maintains he had no idea about the severity of what was happening in the crowd as he continued his set, telling fans in an Instagram video Saturday night he is \"devastated\" by what happened.\"Any time I could make out, you know, anything that's going on, you know, I just stopped my show and, you know, helped them get the help they need,\" Scott says in the video.Footage from the concert's live stream also showed Scott pausing his performance and looking on in apparent confusion as an ambulance pulled into the crowd before finishing the concert. Concertgoers Nick Johnson and Angel Rodriguez told CNN Scott stopped the show on at least three occasions to ask for help for those in the crowd. When asked why the show was not stopped sooner, Finner cited potential rioting \"when you have a group that's young\" in a crowd of roughly 50,000 people.Finner said there was a \"discussion between promoters, the fire department, the police department, and NRG officials\" about stopping the event. Around 10:10 p.m.: The performance was stopped and the event came to an end, according to Houston mayor Sylvester Turner. One concertgoer told CNN's Rosa Flores he looked at his watch when the concert ended, and it indicated \"10:13 or 10:14 p.m.\"CNN's Alaa Elassar, Maya Brown, Andy Rose, Jason Hanna, Fernando Alfonso III, Jenn Selva, Tonju Francois and Corey James contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)A New York man was arrested Wednesday night after allegedly assaulting seven Asian women in a span of about two hours over the weekend, according to the New York City Police Department.Police have recommended Steven Zajonc, 28, be charged with seven counts of assault as a hate crime, seven counts of attempted assault as a hate crime, seven counts of aggravated harassment, and seven counts of harassment. CNN has not yet been able to identify an attorney for Zajonc and has reached out to the Legal Aid Society to inquire whether its lawyers are representing him.The attacks took place from Midtown Manhattan down to the Nolita neighborhood between roughly 6:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. Sunday, according to police.  No statements were made before the attacks, and there was no prior interaction between the victims and the assailant, police said.Read MoreI can't stop thinking that I could have been Christina Yuna LeePolice said the first victim, a 57-year-old Asian woman, was attacked near Madison Avenue and East 30th Street. A man struck her in the face before fleeing north toward 31st Street, police said. The victim sought medical treatment at a nearby hospital for a cut to her lip and swelling to her face. About 10 minutes later, police received another call about an assault near Fifth Avenue and East 30th Street. In this incident, the man punched a 25-year-old Asian woman in the face and the back of the arm before running off, police said.  Roughly five minutes later, police say a man punched a 21-year-old Asian woman in the face near Park Avenue South and East 23rd Street. The victim suffered a laceration and swelling to the mouth and was transported to an area hospital for treatment, police said.The fourth assault took place just before 7 p.m. when a 25-year-old Asian woman was punched in the face in the Union Square area near Irving Place and East 17th Street, police said. The victim suffered a laceration to her face and a swollen lip but did not require immediate medical treatment.About 15 minutes later, a 19-year-old Asian woman was approached by a man who elbowed her in the face in the vicinity of Union Square East and East 17th Street, police said. The man took off in an unknown direction.  The sixth and seventh attacks occurred in the Lower East Side. A man elbowed a 25-year-old Asian woman near East Houston and Mott Street, police say.About an hour later, a man approached a 20-year-old Asian woman and shoved her to the ground before fleeing feeling westbound on foot, according to police.  Asian woman attacked last year in New York by man with rock has died, family says Assaults on Asian women have been reported for months in New York and some have turned deadly. Earlier this week, a woman who was attacked last year in Queens by a man with a rock died, her family said.In November, GuiYing Ma, 61, was sweeping the sidewalk of an empty property in Jackson Heights when a man allegedly struck her in the head repeatedly with a large rock, injuring her face and head, police said at the time.The NYPD created an Asian Hate Crime Task Force after an increase in attacks on Asian Americans during the Covid-19 pandemic.The department recorded 524 hate crime incidents in the city last year -- nearly double the 2020 count, according to a department report. That number is the highest it's been in at least five years, according to the NYPD's archive.About 131 anti-Asian incidents were confirmed in 2021 -- a massive jump from the 27 reported in 2020, and the single incident reported a year prior.When it was created, the NYPD's Asian Hate Crime Task Force included at least 25 Asian American officers to help break down language barriers that often kept victims from reporting their experiences, police said at the time.CNN's Nicole Chavez contributed to this report.",

Recent derbies have been a \"celebration of where women's football has come,\" Bardsley said, remembering fondly a 2019 game at City's Etihad stadium which drew a crowd of 30,000 people. \"I thought that was really cool. There were 30, some odd thousand people at that game. It was an amazing atmosphere,\" the 37-year-old said.

It was literally top bins. So there's just nothing to differentiate that men or women, it was just an incredible goal,\" said Bardsley. Sunday's game carries extra weight because City and United are neck and neck in the race for the coveted Champions League qualification spots, sitting in fifth and fourth place in the Women's Super League respectively. City will be without their captain Steph Houghton after the England international underwent an operation for an Achilles issue. It is a blow to a team already blighted by injuries this season, according to Bardsley. \"Yeah, unfortunately we had just really bad timing, I think ... we had the good fortune of a lot of players getting selected to present their respective nations at the Olympics. But I think there was an element of fatigue that they probably couldn't recover from quickly enough.\" Bardsley saves from Alisha Lehmann of West Ham United on May 4, 2019.A match made in heaven Bardsley joined Manchester City in 2014, when the women's team was relaunched. Her arrival came at a chaotic time for the team given it was still in its infancy, but was fortuitous for both parties. Playing for Lincoln at the time, Bardsley was at a hotel by Manchester Airport waiting for a flight to the United States. She received a call from her agent who explained that the club's director of women's football, Gavin Makel, wanted to sign her up. \"I was like: 'Well, tell him that I'm going to be at the airport if he wants to come and speak to me. I'm staying the night.' So he is like: 'All right.' Then he rings me back maybe like 10 minutes later, he is like: 'Yeah, he is going to meet you.' I was like: 'What? Okay.'\"The club promised the footballing community that the squad's development would \"mirror\" the men's team and \"take advantage of the resources of the wider organization.\" It has since been quoted as saying the women's team is a \"strategic investment.\"This commitment to progress was what convinced Bardsley it was the right move for her.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosBardsley celebrates having won the Continental Cup in 2019.\"I think for me at the stage of my career, it was something that I felt like I had been denied for a very long time,\" she said. \"I wanted to be part of an up-and-coming club with a really interesting methodology. I wanted to be a better player as well, obviously.\"She has played over 100 games for City and helped the team win the Continental Cup -- the equivalent of the League Cup -- three times, saving two penalties in a dramatic penalty shootout in their last triumph in 2019. She completed a set of domestic trophies after winning the 2017 FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium. Despite growing up in California and maintaining an American twang to her accent, Bardsley is an England legend. Her parents hail from Stockport, a town in Greater Manchester, and she made her England international debut in 2005. Since then, she has represented the three Lions at three World Cups, and Great Britain at the 2012 London Olympics.",

But what if fate not only brings you together, but also places you in direct competition on one of the world's biggest sporting stages?That was the destiny of tennis sensation Cori \"Coco\" Gauff in 2019 when, as the youngest ever qualifier at Wimbledon, she found herself facing the legendary Venus Williams.\"I just remember walking out on the court blasting music with my head held down because I didn't want to look at the crowd,\" Gauff told CNN's Becky Anderson in Dubai. \"It was such a long walk from the locker room. It was, like, 15 minutes,\" she recalls. \"Then they have all the walls of the champions, and obviously, I saw Venus there so many times. I was like, 'Oh my gosh, she's lifted this trophy so many times. And here I am like, about to go on against her.'\"What happened next was the stuff of fantasy, as the teenager swept her veteran rival aside in straight sets. Stone-faced, almost disbelieving, Gauff walked slowly towards a beaming Williams, who congratulated her warmly from across the net as the crowd erupted in wild applause.Cori \"Coco\" Gauff greets Venus Williams at the net after winning their women's singles match at Wimbledon 2019.Read MoreElegant dominanceAlmost three years on, Gauff still finds inspiration from Venus and her sister Serena. \"I'm inspired by both of them,\" she says. \"And I would say, I don't know, I just think not only their games, but how they handled themselves off the court is something that I look up to.\"Gauff also acknowledges the importance of having two Black role models in a sport that has traditionally lacked diversity. \"For me, there's not much representation of people that look like me in this sport; so, for me as a young girl, just seeing them dominate and do it so elegantly, kind of just inspired me.\"Serena Williams Fast FactsVenus has also become something of a Coco Gauff fan, too. \"I've gotten to have conversations with them, like Venus, I got to play doubles with [her]. That was just something I never thought of happening. And she's always rooting for me. \"I remember her posting Instagram stories saying, people ask her questions like, 'Who she's rooting for?' and she would say, 'Serena,' and then she will say, also me, and I thought that's just really cool because I never thought that would happen. \"I mean, as a kid, I never thought I'd play either of them, let alone play doubles with one of them!\"Gauff plays a backhand in her first round singles match of the Australian Open in January 2022.Role modelAlthough she will only turn 18 in March, Gauff is already treading her own path as a role model for others. She spoke out during the protests following the murder of George Floyd and believes in using her position to inspire change.  \"For me, I just feel like it's not so much of responsibility, I feel like that's just me, and that's like my identity,\" she told Anderson.\"I want to stand up for people who look like me and feel like they don't have a voice. And I'm lucky enough that some people in the world care about what I have to say. So I try to make sure that I say it and say in a correct way, or in a way that people understand.\"  She says she is mindful of setting an example to her two younger brothers. \"I would say I just kind of try to hold myself to what I want my brothers to be, [and be] a role model for my brothers.\"'Your mindset can change everything in your life'The Atlanta-born star also draws her own inspiration from closer to home. Her grandmother survived cancer, and Gauff says watching that battle, and the positive mindset with which her grandmother approached it, was a learning experience. \"I think your mind kind of controls everything. Your mind controls, you know, how your body feels and how your mood is,\" she explains.  \"One of the things I learned growing up, my grandmother she had lung cancer when I was younger, and now she's cancer free, but I just remember her never being too negative about it, and her always being positive.\"Gauff and Anderson on court for a friendly match.That attitude made a lasting impression on the youngster and her views on mental health. \"I remembered my grandmother telling me that the only reason she thinks she conquered it -- because she had stage four and the chances weren't looking good -- was that she would just wake up every day so mentally in a positive and happy light. \"You know, as a kid, I didn't really understand what was going on. But I remember just never seeing her sad or upset or saying, 'Why me?' Instead, she was saying, like, 'Why not me?' So I think for me, now at this age, that showed me that your mindset can change everything in your life. So, if you're not good mentally, you know, it could be as painful.\"Limiting social mediaA new pressure that young sports stars are born into now is the spotlight of social media, and Gauff says that she has learned to avoid spending too much time online. \"I'm really rarely on Twitter or Instagram. I'm just there to like my friends' posts and comment and then log off again,\" she says. \"I would say TikTok is the only one that I'm on the most, just because I don't see much tennis, I don't see much about me on the app, which I like.\"Resisting the temptation to try and please everyone on social media is important, Gauff believes. \"I feel like a lot of people have a lot of nice things to say, I would say definitely the positive outweighs the bad. But I guess, you know, I feel like as a human you kind of want to look at what people are saying to you and saying about you. \"As humans, we have it in our heads to please everyone, so you want to know what bad things people think about you so you can fix it. But some things are just, you just can't fix it. And so I just kind of stay off it.\"Gauff said she tries not to spend too much time on social media.It is a single-minded philosophy that seems to extend to other areas of her life, too. Gauff is a firm believer in following your own path for your own reasons. \"If you're not doing it for yourself, then don't waste your time doing it,\" she says. \"Because you have to remember this is going to be your life and you don't want to spend the only life that you have being miserable.\"Making every moment count is a part of that, she says. \"I think every day counts, whether it's something little that you do every day, it's a chance to improve. The sun goes up and down every day and you want to make sure you make the most of the time that matters in between.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Of all the special moments that Collin Morikawa has enjoyed during his short but action-packed professional career, becoming close friends with Tiger Woods is among his favorites.Morikawa only turned pro in 2019 but has already made history as the first male golfer to win both the PGA Championship and the Open in his tournament debuts.Despite playing golf from a relatively early age, Morikawa didn't really watch the sport when he was growing up. As a result, he never really looked up to the game's greats as heroes or for motivation, as many aspiring golfers would.The exception, however, is Woods.\"I think when you bring up Tiger Woods to someone that doesn't even know anything about golf, they know he represents golf and the sport of golf,\" Morikawa tells CNN's Becky Anderson. Read More\"What he's done for this game, how he's changed the evolution of not just the physical aspect, the mental aspect, but just growing the game around the world. That's someone who I look up to.Tiger Woods names Aaron Beverly as recipient of Charlie Sifford exemption to play PGA Tour event\"It's amazing to have a friendship, to know him, to talk to him and that's the coolest thing, is that he's grown this game like no one else ever has. \"There's only a few athletes in the world that I can think of, and that really anyone can think of, that have done that to their respective sport. So that's, of course, someone who I'm going to look up to.\"There is one interaction in particular from their relationship which stands out to Morikawa.During the 2020 Farmers Insurance Open -- the first time Morikawa had been paired with Woods on the PGA Tour -- Woods nailed a drive down the middle of the fairway, then turned to Morikawa and cracked a joke.\"I'm like: 'What's going on? This is weird,'\" he recalls. \"'He's trying to beat me, I know he is, and I'm trying to beat him as well.' But it made it just that much more relaxing and you could see the human side of him.\"I think what I've realized is that we're not just golfers and I think everyone has that perception, is that all we do is golf 24/7, but there's so much more behind the layers of every single person out here and that's been cool to get to know these people as actual humans.\"Their pairing at that tournament was a significant moment for both players -- and one that will have made several viewers feel quite old -- as Morikawa became the first player born after Woods turned pro in 1996 to be paired with the 14-time major winner in a PGA Tour event.Had Morikawa been playing back then, he speculates their friendship perhaps might not have developed.\"It's so different because you hear these stories when he was turning pro very early on, early when I was really young, that he wouldn't talk to anyone,\" he says. \"He was really focused, really dialed in.\"Obviously, he's grown a lot. He's at a different stage of his life. He's got a couple kids. Thankfully, he's a lot more relaxed.\"READ: After 'life-changing' major win, Collin Morikawa says fame won't change himDon't call it a breakoutTo go along with his PGA Championship win in 2020 and Open victory the following year, Morikawa capped a remarkable 2021 by winning the European Tour's season-ending DP World Tour Championship and became the first American in history to win the Race to Dubai.Morikawa's sustained success in 2021 -- which also included a winning record in Team USA's Ryder Cup victory -- proved that 2020 was no fluke, but the 24-year-old stops short of calling 2021 his \"breakout\" year.\"I like how you state that as a breakout year because I don't look at it as that way,\" he explains. \"I'm sure many people do and look, don't get me wrong, the year I had in 2021 was amazing -- a WGC, a major, Race to Dubai, a DP World Tour Championship -- but I look at it as there are so many places to improve, so many places to get better.Morikawa celebrates on the 17th green after guaranteeing the half point needed for the US to win the Ryder Cup.\"And that's how I keep getting better is that I think I have so much room for growth, that I'm just ready to do more. It's not: 'How do I top last year? How do I do this? How do I do that?' It's just: 'I want to win more. I want to contend more.' And when I don't, I got to figure out why.\"Though still quite some time away, Morikawa has already started thinking about defending his Open title in July.The Los Angeles native put in a fine performance in defense of his PGA Championship title last year, eventually finishing tied for eighth, but has set his sights on topping that at the prestigious St. Andrews course, dubbed 'the Home of Golf.'\"Anytime you're defending a tournament, it's special because obviously you had won that tournament the previous year,\" he says. \"But when it's the Open Championship, it's even that much more special. It's a major ... when it's the 150th, how do you top that? Morikawa kisses the Claret Jug on the 18th hole after winning The 149th Open at Royal St George's Golf Club.\"And then being at St. Andrews, the home of golf, a lot of things had to align to get there as a defending champion.\"But I don't want to just show up as a defending champion and be known for that. I want to come out as a contender. I want to come out and win, and hopefully defend again. So that's the number one goal, obviously to show up and win again.\"If Morikawa's 2021 is anything to go by, then it seems unlikely he'll stop winning anytime soon.",

        "content": "(CNN)The bomb used by the Saudi-led coalition in a devastating attack on a school bus in Yemen was sold as part of a US State Department-sanctioned arms deal with Saudi Arabia, munitions experts told CNN.Working with local Yemeni journalists and munitions experts, CNN has established that the weapon that left dozens of children dead on August 9 was a 500-pound (227 kilogram) laser-guided MK 82 bomb made by Lockheed Martin, one of the top US defense contractors.The bomb is very similar to the one that wreaked devastation in an attack on a funeral hall in Yemen in October 2016 in which 155 people were killed and hundreds more wounded. The Saudi coalition blamed \"incorrect information\" for that strike, admitted it was a mistake and took responsibility.The schoolboys on a field trip in Yemen were chatting and laughing. Then came the airstrikeIn March of that year, a strike on a Yemeni market -- this time reportedly by a US-supplied precision-guided MK 84 bomb -- killed 97 people.In the aftermath of the funeral hall attack, former US President Barack Obama banned the sale of precision-guided military technology to Saudi Arabia over \"human rights concerns.\"Read MoreThe ban was overturned by the Trump administration's then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in March 2017.As the US-backed Saudi-led coalition scrambles to investigate the strike on the school bus, questions are growing from observers and rights groups about whether the US bears any moral culpability. The US says it does not make targeting decisions for the coalition, which is fighting a Houthi rebel insurgency in Yemen. But it does support its operations through billions of dollars in arms sales, the refueling of Saudi combat aircraft and some sharing of intelligence.\"I will tell you that we do help them plan what we call, kind of targeting,\" said US Secretary of Defense James Mattis. \"We do not do dynamic targeting for them.\" A man mourns over the casket of one of the children killed in the strike. The latest strike has left the community in Yemen's northern Saada governorate reeling.Zeid Al Homran visits the graveyard where his two little boys are buried every day. On this occasion, he brought their five-year-old brother along. He is all Al Homran has left.\"I was screaming in anger and all around me women were throwing themselves on the ground,\" he told CNN. \"People were screaming out the names of their children. I tried to tell the women it couldn't be true but then a man ran through the crowd shouting that a plane had struck the children's bus.\"A photo shows Osama Zeid Al Homran, who took cell phone footage inside the bus before it was hit in a strike that killed him and dozens of his peers. 'Bodies scattered everywhere'The bomb's impact as it landed on the bus full of excited schoolchildren on a day trip was devastating.Of the 51 people who died in the airstrike, 40 were children, Houthi Health Minister Taha al-Mutawakil said last week. He added that of the 79 people wounded, 56 were children.Eyewitnesses told CNN it was a direct hit in the middle of a busy market.\"I saw the bomb hit the bus,\" one witness said. \"It blew it into those shops and threw the bodies clear to the other side of those buildings. We found bodies scattered everywhere, there was a severed head inside the bomb crater. When we found that, that was when I started running. I was so afraid.\"Some of the bodies were so mutilated that identification became impossible. Left behind were scraps of schoolbooks, warped metal and a single backpack.Munitions experts said the numbers on this piece of shrapnel confirmed that Lockheed Martin was the maker of the bomb.  Images of shrapnel filmed in the immediate aftermath of the attack were sent to CNN by a contact in Saada. Subsequently, a cameraman working for CNN filmed footage of the shrapnel after the cleanup operation had begun.Munitions experts confirmed that the numbers on it identified Lockheed Martin as its maker and that this particular MK 82 was a Paveway, a laser-guided bomb.Asked to comment on CNN's evidence, coalition spokesman Col. Turki al-Maliki said: \"The democratically elected government of Yemen has been displaced by an Iranian-backed insurgency by minority Houthi militias.\" Yemeni children receive treatment at a hospital after being wounded in the August 9 strike.\"The coalition is in Yemen with the support of the UN Security Council to restore the legitimate government. The coalition is operating in accordance with international humanitarian law, taking all practical measures to minimize civilian casualties. Every civilian casualty is a tragedy.\"He added that it would not \"be appropriate for the coalition to comment further while the investigation is underway.\"Saudi Arabia denies targeting civilians and defended the incident as a \"legitimate military operation\" and a retaliatory response to a Houthi ballistic missile from the day before.   A Pentagon spokeswoman, Lt. Cmdr. Rebecca Rebarich, declined to confirm the provenance of the bomb.\"The US has worked with the Saudi-led coalition to help them improve procedures and oversight mechanisms to reduce civilian casualties,\" she said.\"While we do not independently verify claims of civilian casualties in which we are not directly involved, we call on all sides to reduce such casualties, including those caused via ballistic missile attacks on civilian population centers in Saudi Arabia.\"The United Nations has called for a separate investigation into the strike, one of the deadliest since Yemen's war began in early 2015. Since then, the Saudi-led coalition has battled rebels in support of exiled President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi.Greater US oversightThere have been growing calls in the US Congress for Saudi Arabia, a key US ally in the Middle East, to do more to cut civilian deaths in Yemen, where three years of conflict have taken a terrible toll.On Monday, US President Donald Trump signed a defense spending bill that includes a clause requiring the Pentagon and State Department to certify that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, another key coalition member, are doing enough to reduce civilian casualties. This report must be submitted to Congress within 180 days and then annually for the next two years.JUST WATCHEDDad finds the body of his son killed in airstrikeReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHDad finds the body of his son killed in airstrike 01:40The US, alongside the UK and France, is a major supplier of arms to Saudi Arabia.Trump signed a nearly $110 billion defense deal with Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud in May last year in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on what was his first stop abroad as President.In the same month, the US government reauthorized the export of Paveway munitions to Saudi Arabia, ending Obama's December 2016 ban.Retired Rear Adm. John Kirby, who served as a spokesman for the State Department and Pentagon under Obama, said the Saudis had a right to defend themselves against missile attacks from the Iranian-backed Houthis but that the Obama administration did not believe they were striking the right balance between that need and proper care for civilian life.Asked whether the US had moral complicity in the deaths in Yemen, he said: \"The issue of complicity is one that international lawyers probably are best to work out, not somebody like me.\"\"What I would tell you is that we certainly had under the Obama administration deep concerns about the way the Saudis were targeting, and we acted on those concerns by limiting the kinds of munitions that they were being given and stridently trying to argue for them to be more careful and cautious.\"People gather on August 12 at the site of the deadly airstrike in Saada.'Legitimate military action'In the immediate aftermath of the strike, al-Maliki, the coalition spokesman, told CNN it had been aimed at a \"legitimate target.\"\"No, this is not children in the bus,\" he said. \"We do have high standard measures for targeting.\"The Saudi ambassador to the UN, Abdullah Al-Mouallimi, similarly told the Security Council this week that the strike was a \"legitimate military action\" and that \"the targeted Houthi leaders were responsible for recruiting and training young children and sending them to battlefields.\"\"We are not engaged in the civil war. We will help to prevent, you know, the killing of innocent people. I'm very concerned about the humanitarian situation,\" US Defense Secretary James Mattis said Sunday when asked about the strike. \"Wars are always tragic, but we've got to find a way to protect the innocent in the midst of this one.\"Yemen at risk of third cholera epidemic, health officials warnDespite a lack of public condemnation over the school bus strike, there are signs that the Trump administration is taking action behind the scenes.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo discussed the Saudi-led strike with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in a call on Monday. A three-star US general also raised the matter while in Saudi Arabia to meet with the Saudi government and other coalition partners, the Pentagon said.\"The real key is whether or not the Pentagon can help change the calculus, the thinking, inside the Saudi military,\" said Kirby.The conflict in Yemen has resulted in the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with more than 22 million people -- three-quarters of the population -- in desperate need of aid and protection, according to the UN.",

Young men gather in Victoria Square, central Athens.How it works Read MoreIt starts with eye contact, a seemingly benign hello, or a request for a cigarette.On one bench an older man rubs the shoulders of a young refugee. Others troll the square in small groups scoping out their options.\"It's a game,\" explains social worker Tassos Smetopoulos.\"There are older guys that just offer accommodation, food, clothes. But of course the minors want money. That's the idea: To find money to go illegally to central Europe.\"HookedOne of those seeking an escape is Ali (not his real name), a 17-year-old from Afghanistan. He came to Europe hoping to get an education and eventually bring his mother over to join him.He arrived in Greece alone, with \u20ac270 ($286) to his name, no place to stay and found himself in an environment rife with drugs and prostitution. Now, dependent on drugs and money from clients, the reality of what his life has become is overwhelming.Condoms litter the ground of a park in central Athens.\"I told myself, 'look at yourself, you came to Europe, what was your aim?'\" He says. \"I am not doing this because I like it. \"If I wanted to do something I like, I would date a girl. [But] because I don't have the money I don't have a choice.\"READ: Three generations of refugees on today's crisisLike many of his friends, Ali regularly heads to the sprawling park nearby, where deals are usually made with local men, ranging from \u20ac5 to \u20ac12 ($5.50 to $13). It's #MyFreedomDay: All over the world, students are fighting slavery\"Some offer \u20ac3, some 100, some 80. But I don't go with anyone for less than \u20ac60,\" he explains. 'It doesn't get easier'In the clearings off the pathways, dozens of condom wrappers litter the ground.\"At the end of the day when you go inside the park, they come, some pull their pants down so you see their ass,\" Ali says.\"Some come to you, talk to you and show you their money, it works like this.\"Ali says some of the older men offer to take the boys to a local disco and back to their homes.Migrant crisis: Misery builds in Greek transit camp after migrant route sealedREAD: Thousands flee fire at refugee camp in GreeceHe has been prostituting himself every other day for the past three or four weeks -- the money and an opportunity of a warm bed too good to turn down.\"Some will take you home, give you clothes and anything you like,\" he says.\"They will treat you like their husband, their boyfriend, they will give you \u20ac200, \u20ac300, \u20ac400.\"It's very hard. How can a person be with another man like that? Those men are sick. No matter how often I do it, it doesn't get easier.\"Clinging to hopeMany of the refugees cling to the promises of smugglers, who also roam the park, that with enough money they can get to western Europe illegally and declare asylum there.\"It's shocking for us, for me, for you,\" said Tassos.\"But for them [sex clients and smugglers] it's like new meat. With people who are desperate, it's very easy to abuse them.\"Why now?The seeming rise in unaccompanied minors prostituting themselves comes after a \"one-for-one\" deal brokered between the EU and Turkey in March.The agreement stipulated that Turkey would accept back migrants who had crossed its borders into Greece, while the EU would resettle refugees directly from Turkey. Alli has not told his mother of his plight in Greece.But the deal effectively froze refugees in place, leaving tens of thousands stranded in Greece, a country still unable to adequately accommodate them.Among those still waiting for shelter are around 1,200 unaccompanied minors, according to the Greek government -- but in reality the number is likely much higher.Many refugees have not registered with authorities for fear of being sent back home after struggling to get this far as the EU has declared countries like Afghanistan \"safe.\"What is being done?Greek police said in a statement that they had not had any reports of unaccompanied minors involved in the sex trade in the two specific areas we visited, but added they were aware of the problem and working to address it.The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees also said in a statement that authorities should make sure minors are protected.Read more: Meet Eida -- the 115-year-old refugee with one remaining wishIn the meantime, desperate teenagers like Ali continue to \"do this job,\" despite the humiliation.He willingly answers all of our questions, but when we ask about his mother, and wonder if he will ever tell his family what he is going through, he tears up.\"I am ready to cry,\" he says. \"I don't want to speak about my mother.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Three children were killed and one person was injured in Monday's airstrikes in Mekelle, the capital of Ethiopia's war-torn Tigray region, the United Nations said Tuesday.Jens Laerke, spokesperson of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said at a briefing in Geneva that local health workers in the Mekelle hospital confirmed that the children had been killed as a result of an airstrike on the outskirts of the city. A second airstrike in Mekelle town \"reportedly injured nine people and caused damage to houses and a nearby hotel,\" Laerke said, adding that the \"intensification of the conflict is very alarming.\"A spokesman for the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) accused Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on Monday of targeting civilians in an attack on a busy market day. Ethiopia's federal government launched a military offensive to oust the TPLF last November and fighting has been ongoing since.The state-run Ethiopian Press Agency reported Monday that the Ethiopian Air Force \"launched a successful offensive\" against a TPLF communication network and facility in Mekelle. Airstrikes were \"carried out with the utmost precision to prevent civilian casualties,\" the report said.Read MoreAt least 30 bodies float down river between Ethiopia's Tigray and SudanEarlier Monday, Ethiopia's government communications chief Leggese Tulu denied the strikes, saying that \"the government doesn't have any plan to terrorize its own people. Why should it? It's not true.\"\"Those terrorists want to confuse the world by falsely claiming we are being attacked both by air and land to turn the world against Ethiopia,\" Tulu told CNN. In a separate statement, the government spokesperson's office also said that \"the government of Ethiopia would like to request the US and its partners not to be swayed by the crying wolf TPLF and downplay the suffering of people in north Wollo, Gonder, Wag Hemera of Amhara, and Afar regions.\"The Ethiopian military has been in control of much of Tigray since November 2020, when it launched a major assault on the region with the support of Eritrean soldiers and local militias in an effort to remove the TPLF from power. It was the last time that airstrikes were launched on Mekelle.Mounting atrocitiesAn eyewitness to Monday's incident in Mekelle told CNN she heard an explosion and saw smoke in the vicinity of Adi Haki Market, describing a scene of panic with people running around when she left her office following the blast.One resident of the city told Reuters one strike hit close to a market, behind a hotel. An aid worker and a doctor in the region also said there had been an attack and a diplomat shared pictures with Reuters of what they said was the aftermath, including pools of blood and smashed windows.Laerke reminded all parties of their responsibility according to international humanitarian law on Tuesday saying: \"We also call on unrestricted and sustained humanitarian access to all people in need, who need our supplies. They also need fuel and cash.\" UN says food aid in Ethiopia's war-torn Tigray region will run out Friday as 400,000 people face famineOn Monday the UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said through his spokesman Stephane Dujarric that he was deeply concerned over the escalation of the conflict and reiterated his call for all hostilities to stop.Ethiopia has seen a wave of atrocities over the last 11 months of conflict, which has forced 2 million to flee, fueled famine and left thousands dead. The conflict, by many accounts, bears the hallmarks of genocide.In late September, Ethiopia said that it was expelling seven senior United Nations officials, just days after the UN's aid chief warned that the Tigray region was descending into famine due to the government's blockade of aid deliveries.An estimated 18,600 children in Tigray under the age of 5 have been admitted for treatment for severe acute malnutrition (SAM) from February to August this year, according to UNICEF. That's a 100% increase compared to 2020, it said.CNN's Kara Fox and Eliza Mackintosh contributed reporting.",

The eyewitness in Mekelle told CNN she heard an explosion and saw smoke in the vicinity of Adi Haki Market, describing a scene of panic with people running around when she left her office following the blast.One resident of the city told Reuters one strike hit close to a market, behind a hotel. An aid worker and a doctor in the region also said there had been an attack and a diplomat shared pictures with Reuters of what they said was the aftermath, including pools of blood and smashed windows.A spokesman for the Tigray People's Liberation Front accused Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed of targeting civilians in an attack on a busy market day. Ethiopia's federal government launched a military offensive to oust the TPLF last November and fighting has been ongoing since. One of the targets of the airstrikes was the Planet Hotel where a \"dozen or so humanitarian agencies used to have their employees,\" TPLF spokesman Getachew Reda claimed.  \"Our people won't be cowed into submission by a desperate move by a desperate regime teetering on the brink of collapse.\"Read MoreThe state-run Ethiopian Press Agency reported Monday that the Ethiopian Air Force \"launched a successful offensive\" against a TPLF communication network and facility in Mekelle. Airstrikes were \"carried out with the utmost precision to prevent civilian casualties,\" the report said.Ethiopia's government communications chief Leggese Tulu had earlier denied the strikes, telling CNN that \"the government doesn't have any plan to terrorize its own people. Why should it? It's not true. Those terrorists want to confuse the world by falsely claiming we are being attacked both by air and land to turn the world against Ethiopia.\"In a separate statement, the government spokesperson's office also said that \"the government of Ethiopia would like to request the US and its partners not to be swayed by the crying wolf TPLF and downplay the suffering of people in north Wollo, Gonder, Wag Hemera of Amhara, and Afar regions.\"Ethiopia used its flagship commercial airline to transport weapons during war in TigrayThe Ethiopian military has been in control of much of Tigray since November 2020, when it launched a major assault on the region with the support of Eritrean soldiers and local militias in an effort to remove the TPLF from power. It was the last time that airstrikes were launched on Mekelle. The operation was initiated after Abiy accused the TPLF of attacking a federal military base in Mekelle, and after Tigray's leaders took the decision to elect a regional administration.In July, Tigrayan fighters retook Mekelle -- a city of a half-million people -- marking a stunning turn in the country's devastating conflict. In the wake of Mekelle's capture, the Ethiopian government announced a unilateral ceasefire for several months. But Tigrayan forces categorically ruled out a truce, with a TPLF spokesman saying their forces would not rest until the Ethiopian military and its allied forces had left the entire region.Human rights abusesEthiopia has seen a wave of atrocities over the last eleven months of conflict, which has forced 2 million to flee, fueled famine and left thousands dead. The conflict, by many accounts, bears the hallmarks of genocide. In late September, Ethiopia said that it was expelling seven senior United Nations officials, just days after the UN's aid chief warned that the Tigray region was descending into famine due to the government's blockade of aid deliveries.Men are marched out of prison camps. Then corpses float down the riverAn estimated 18,600 children in Tigray under the age of five have been admitted for treatment for severe acute malnutrition (SAM) from February to August this year, according to UNICEF. That's a 100% increase compared to 2020, it said.Last month, US President Joe Biden signed a new executive order authorizing broad sanctions against those involved in perpetrating the ongoing conflict. But they have not yet gone into effect.Asked on Monday what the administration was waiting for to apply the sanctions, US State Department spokesperson Ned Price told CNN that \"we are absolutely prepared to use that tool as might be appropriate.\"Though all sides have been accused by the UN of committing grave human rights abuses, previous CNN investigations found that Eritrean soldiers were behind among some of the worst abuses carried out in Tigray, including sexual violence and massacres. Eritrea has denied wrongdoing by its soldiers, and has refused to pull them out of the region.",

        "content": "(CNN)Ethiopia's government has used the country's flagship commercial airline to shuttle weapons to and from neighboring Eritrea during the civil war in Ethiopia's Tigray region, a CNN investigation has found.  Cargo documents and manifests seen by CNN, as well as eyewitness accounts and photographic evidence, confirm that arms were transported between Addis Ababa's international airport and airports in the Eritrean cities of Asmara and Massawa on board multiple Ethiopian Airlines planes in November 2020 during the first few weeks of the Tigray conflict.   It's the first time this weapons trade between the former foes has been documented during the war. Experts said the flights would constitute a violation of international aviation law, which forbids the smuggling of arms for military use on civil aircraft.   Atrocities committed during the conflict also appear to violate the terms of a trade program that provides lucrative access to the United States market and which Ethiopian Airlines has benefited greatly from.  Ethiopian Airlines is a state-owned economic powerhouse that generates billions of dollars a year carrying passengers to hubs across the African continent and all over the world, and it is also a member of the Star Alliance, a group of some of the world's top aviation companies. Read MoreThe airline has issued multiple denials about transporting weapons. On Thursday, Ethiopian Airlines said in a statement that it \"strongly refutes\" the findings of CNN's latest investigation. \"To the best of its knowledge and its records, it has not transported any war armament in any of its routes by any of its aircraft,\" the airline said, echoing previous denials.The statement said \"alleged pictures\" in CNN's report are not known to Ethiopian Airlines. It also focused on one entry in cargo documents that said \"food stuff and refill,\" saying that the goods were \"declared on the document as per IATA standards.\"The governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea did not respond to CNN's requests for comment. JUST WATCHEDEthiopian Airlines carried weapons for its government ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHEthiopian Airlines carried weapons for its government  04:15Military refills  Long-simmering tensions between Ethiopia's government and the ruling party in the Tigray region exploded on November 4, when Ethiopia accused the Tigray People's Liberation Front of attacking a federal army base. Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia's Nobel Peace Prize-winning prime minister, ordered a military offensive to oust the TPLF from power. Government forces and regional militias poured into Tigray, joined on the front lines by troops from Eritrea.  Thousands of people are estimated to have died in the conflict, which by many accounts bears the hallmarks of genocide and ethnic cleansing. While all sides have been accused of committing grave human rights abuses during Tigray's war, previous CNN investigations established that Eritrean soldiers have been behind some of the worst atrocities, including sexual violence and mass killings. Eritrea has denied wrongdoing by its soldiers and only admitted to having troops in Tigray this spring.  Documents obtained by CNN indicate that flights carrying weapons between Ethiopia and Eritrea began at least as early as a few days after the outset of the Tigray conflict.  \n\nAir waybill showing transportation of 'RIFFLE & DFS' -- in reference to rifles and dry foodstuffs per airline sources -- on an Ethiopian Airlines flight on November 12.\n\nOn at least six occasions -- from November 9 to November 28 -- Ethiopian Airlines billed Ethiopia's ministry of defense tens of thousands of dollars for military items including guns and ammunition to be shipped to Eritrea, records seen by CNN show.  The documents, known as air waybills, detail the contents of each shipment. In one document, the \"nature and quantity of goods\" is listed as \"Military refill\" and \"Dry food stuff.\" Other entries included the description \"Consolidated.\" The records also had abbreviations and spelling mistakes such as \"AM\" for ammunition and \"RIFFLES\" for rifles, according to airline employees. They told CNN the spelling errors were introduced when the contents were manually entered by employees into the cargo database. \n\nEthiopian Airlines cargo manifest for the same flight carrying rifles on November 12.\n\nBenno Baksteen, chairman of DEGAS, the Dutch Expert Group Aviation Safety, told CNN that these waybills were required for all commercial flights as the crew on board need to know the contents of the cargo to ensure they are transported safely. On November 9, five days after Abiy ordered a military offensive in Tigray, records show an Ethiopian Airlines flight transported guns and ammunitions from Addis Ababa to Asmara, Eritrea's capital.  An air waybill and a cargo manifest from that date show that Ethiopian Airlines charged Ethiopia $166,398.32 for about 2,643 pieces of \"DFS & RIFFLE WITH AM (sic)\" on that flight. DFS is a reference to \"dry food stuff,\" according to airline sources.   \n\nAir waybill showing 'military refill' being transported on an Ethiopian Airlines flight on November 13.\n\nAnother air waybill from a few days later, November 13, has the same shipper and consignee. The content of that shipment was \"military refill and dry food stuff,\" according to the document. The shipments came at a time of increased military activity; security sources in the region told CNN the Eritreans needed re-supply for the fight in Tigray. As planes went back and forth between the two countries, massacres of Tigrayans in the city of Axum and the village of Dengelat by Eritrean troops took place on November 19 and November 30 respectively.  Cargo documents show that the series of flights between Ethiopia and Eritrea continued until at least November 28, 2020. Some current and former Ethiopian Airlines employees, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions, said the flights continued past this date but that the majority of arms trips to Eritrea were in November.  Both cargo and passenger planes were used in the operation, though CNN has no evidence that commercial passengers were on any of the flights carrying weapons. Many of these flights do not appear on popular online flight tracking platforms such as Flightradar24. When they do, the destination in Eritrea is often not visible and the flight path vanishes once the plane crosses the border from Ethiopia.   The employees told CNN the staff could manually turn off the ADS-B signal on board to prevent the flights being publicly tracked.  The flights were often assigned the same flight numbers, primarily ET3312, ET3313 and ET3314, with 'ET' being the code for Ethiopian Airlines. All the planes mentioned in the cargo files seen by CNN are American-made Boeing aircraft. The airline has been in a long relationship with the US aviation giant.   A Boeing representative declined to comment. Ethiopian Airlines workers described witnessing other airline employees loading and unloading arms and military vehicles on flights directed to Asmara. A few even claimed they helped load the weapons on the planes themselves. All spoke of being ethnically profiled for being Tigrayan.\u202f CNN has seen the Ethiopian Airlines' ID cards of these employees and confirmed their identities.  One former employee told CNN they were instructed at Addis Ababa's Bole International Airport to load guns and four military vehicles onto an Ethiopian Airlines cargo plane that was due to fly to Belgium but was sent instead to Eritrea.   \"The cars were Toyota pickups which have a stand for snipers,\" the employee said. \"I got a call from the managing director late at night informing me to handle the cargo. Soldiers came at 5 a.m. to start loading two big trucks loaded with weapons and the pickups.\"\u202f  \"I had to stop a flight to Brussels, a 777 cargo plane, which was loaded with flowers, then we unloaded half of the perishable goods to make space for the armaments.\"\u202f   The former employee warned soldiers that the vehicles were carrying far more gas than was allowed under international air transport rules, but said they were overruled after a direct call from an army commander.   \"He [the commander] said we are going to war and we need the fuel to be loaded,\" the employee said. \"Then I referred the issue to my manager and my manager took responsibility and allowed them to load it.\"  The flight, loaded with both weapons and flowers, traveled to Eritrea, then returned to Addis before flying on to Brussels the following day, the employee said. CNN cross-referenced this testimony with Flightradar24 and found the record of an Ethiopian Airlines aircraft returning from the direction of Eritrea and flying to Brussels the next day, but could not independently verify it was the same flight referred to by the employee.  Days later, the employee said they were temporarily suspended from work. They believe they were suspended for being Tigrayan but also for the incident with the soldiers. The employee fled Ethiopia in March.  Ethiopian Airlines told CNN in its statement that no employees had been suspended or terminated due to their ethnic background.   New video of Ethiopia massacre shows soldiers passing phone around to document their executions of unarmed menIt appears to be not the only long-distance international flight with unplanned stops. A flight from Addis Ababa to Shanghai on November 9, 2020, took a long detour via Eritrea according to the ADS-B signal that tracks the route on Flightradar24.  Several employees at the Addis Ababa airport said they saw multiple weapons flights leave for Eritrea each day at the outset of the conflict. They also spoke about flights carrying weapons from Eritrea back to Ethiopia. It's unclear why armaments were being transferred back to Ethiopia. One said they saw tanks and heavy artillery loaded onto planes coming to Addis Ababa, while small arms -- mortars, launchers -- were dispatched to Asmara. Employees told CNN they believed the smaller weaponry were being sent to Asmara to arm Eritrean troops.    All the employees said they were instructed by the airline to delete photos of the weapons from their phones. Not all of them did.   In June, photos circulated on social media platforms showing crates containing mortars on board an Ethiopian Airlines flight and the same crates being loaded on the plane in Massawa, Eritrea.    The company released a statement strongly denying the allegation that its planes were transporting weapons and claimed the photos were photoshopped.\u202f   However, CNN has corroborated the photos using visual analysis techniques, interviews and documentary evidence, dating them to a 777 Freighter cargo flight that flew from Ethiopia to Eritrea and back between November 8 and 9.  The images show a variety of mortars stacked up in the crates. Dan Kaszeta, a London based defense specialist and an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, identified the mortars as 832-DU 82mm mortar rounds, originally made in Russia but with many versions subsequently manufactured, including in Bulgaria.  CNN has contacted the Bulgarian government and reached out to Bulgarian arms producers but received no response. According to the EU's public database, Bulgaria sold weapons to Ethiopia as recently as 2020.  Another image features an employee wearing a uniform that matches with the Ethiopian Airlines uniform. The interior of the plane also fits the layout of an Ethiopian Airlines 777F cargo plane. The expiry date of the Emirates SkyCargo straps tightened around the crates -- November 2023 -- can be seen in the photos. Since these particular types of cargo straps -- TSO C172 -- have a lifespan of three years, they would have been used in November 2020 at the earliest. CNN has confirmed that these Emirates SkyCargo straps have been used on other Ethiopian Airlines flights. Emirates SkyCargo told CNN that its \"straps may be inadvertently mixed with those of other airlines by ground handlers, who are third-party contractors, and may be used to secure cargo transported on other aircraft.\"CNN has learned that the cargo plane in question took off on November 8 from Addis Ababa empty before landing in Massawa, where local workers were tasked with manually loading it with a variety of weapons, including these mortars. People are seen loading crates of weapons onto an Ethiopian Airlines plane at an airport in Massawa, Eritrea. Some faces have been blurred by CNN to preserve anonymity.A cargo manifest from that day, seen by CNN, confirms the flight was empty when it reached Massawa.\u202f  A screenshot from the Ethiopian Airlines internal database taken by an employee and sent to CNN reveals a flight on November 8 to Massawa that is hidden from flight tracking sites. The weapons were then dropped in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia, before the aircraft returned to Addis Ababa on November 9.  'A lot of legal repercussions'  Several aviation experts CNN spoke to on these findings said Ethiopian Airlines appeared to be in violation of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, commonly known as the Chicago Convention, which prohibits commercial carriers from transporting \"munitions of war or implements of war.\"  Pablo Mendes de Leon, professor of air and space law at The Hague, told CNN there are several indications that these flights were commercial flights -- not military or state aircraft -- including \"that [the flights] carry a commercial flight number of Ethiopian Airlines in conjunction with the fact that an airway bill has been issued.\"      \"I have now arrived at the conclusion that [these flights have] been operated by civil aircraft falling under the terms of the Chicago Convention,\" Mendes de Leon said, adding that CNN's findings \"have a lot of legal repercussions and conditions, all of which may not have been met.\"  Ethiopia's status as a regional economic powerhouse is partly dependent on Ethiopian Airlines' dominance in cargo. The country and the airline have benefited from an American trade program that provides favorable access to the US market for countries that meet certain criteria.  This relationship matters for both countries: in 2017, US exports to Ethiopia consisted primarily of aircraft and aircraft components from Boeing, valued at more than $857 million.    But a clause in the US African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) stipulates that eligible nations must not engage in \"gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.\" Previous CNN investigations found atrocities committed by the Ethiopian government and its allies bore the hallmarks of genocide and ethnic cleansing. In late August, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai warned Ethiopia's chief trade negotiator that \"the ongoing violations of internationally recognized human rights\" in Tigray \"could affect Ethiopia's future [AGOA] eligibility if unaddressed.\" On Tuesday, a spokesperson told CNN that Tai's office would conduct its next review of eligibility for AGOA in 2022, \"based upon compliance with standards that include adherence to internationally recognized workers' rights, rule of law, and human rights.\" After the review, Tai could \"possibly recommend that the President add or remove certain countries from AGOA beneficiary country status.\"This story has been updated to include a statement from Emirates SkyCargo, remove an erroneous reference to a cargo strap manufacturer and correct the spelling of the Ethiopian city of Bahir Dar.",

        "content": "A few scattered human bones lay on the rocky ground, along with a broken skull and several half-burned identification cards.  That is all the villagers could find, six months after Ethiopian troops rounded up their loved ones and shot them at point-blank range, throwing the bodies off a rocky hillside deep in the mountains of central Tigray in Ethiopia. An April 2021 CNN investigation, in collaboration with Amnesty International, examined video clips of the January massacre and used geolocation techniques to verify the video was filmed on a ridge near Mahibere Dego in January 2021. The investigation revealed at the time that at least 11 unarmed men were executed, and 39 others were unaccounted for.  JUST WATCHEDHow a massacre in Tigray was captured on videoReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHow a massacre in Tigray was captured on video 04:45CNN was sent the gruesome footage in March this year by a pro-Tigray media organization, the Tigrai Media House (TMH). TMH told CNN at the time that the video was filmed on a mobile phone by an Ethiopian army soldier turned whistleblower involved in the mass killing. An additional longer video clip of the massacre has now been shared with CNN by TMH, revealing new details about the atrocity and the soldiers behind it.  Read MoreCNN used geolocation techniques to determine the extended footage was also filmed at the ridge near Mahibere Dego. A voice at the end of the new clip identifies the Ethiopian soldier filming the video as \"Fafi.\" He also reveals his military brigade and division. In the extended video seen by CNN, Fafi swaps the phone with another soldier, takes the gun and shoots. The phone is then swapped back as others clamor to be filmed executing the captives, brazenly documenting their crimes.   This extended footage has all the hallmarks of a trophy video and yet -- despite the evidence -- the Ethiopian Prime Minister's Office dismissed the findings of CNN's original investigation saying, \"social media posts and claims cannot be taken as evidence.\"  Six months after the attack, two people in Mahibere Dego told CNN they had collected the national identification cards of 36 people who were killed, but another 37 people remain missing, indicating the toll of the massacre could have been more than double what was initially reported.   CNN reached out to the Ethiopian government but it did not respond.  Ethiopia is under growing international pressure over a number of reported atrocities in its war-torn northern Tigray region that could amount to war crimes.  Thousands of civilians are believed to have been killed since early November, when Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed launched a major military operation against the ruling Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), sending in national troops and militia fighters from Ethiopia's Amhara region.  CNN has previously compiled extensive eyewitness testimony that Ethiopian soldiers and soldiers from neighboring Eritrea were perpetrating massacres, extrajudicial killings, sexual violence and other abuses in the region. Since January, families of the victims in Mahibere Dego say they have been unable to access the ridge due to the continued presence of Ethiopian troops in the area -- leaving them without a way to bury their loved ones.  Read more Tigray coverageEritrean troops disguised as Ethiopian military are blocking critical aidDoctors say rape is being used as a weapon of war They thought they'd be safe at a churchBut last Friday, the soldiers departed for nearby Axum, giving locals a long-awaited opportunity to search for any remains, according to nine people CNN interviewed who had visited the massacre site.   Over a period of days, family members of the victims filmed the church burials, documented evidence of bullet casings at the massacre site and took photographs of skeletal remains which they sent to CNN. We are not naming the family members who fear for their safety.  One family member told CNN that even while villagers were gathering up the remains of their loved ones, the area came under attack. Violence in Tigray has once again intensified in recent weeks after Tigrayan forces launched a renewed offensive last week. Even after Ethiopian soldiers withdrew, the massacre site remained under attack. One photograph from the scene of clothing and an ID card left at the scene of the massacre in Mahibere Dego, Tigray.\"The soldiers from Axum started to bomb the area with artillery [fire] around 9-10 p.m. Everyone scattered and ran back home,\" the family member said.    But the villagers refused to stay away, he said, waiting a few days to come back at night to finish what they had started.   In images too graphic to publish, it's clear the remains were too decomposed to allow for identification of the victims -- for some there were only metal belt buckles. Families said they instead relied on items of clothing and ID cards to identify their relatives. Villagers told CNN the continued presence of soldiers in the area was an attempt to hide evidence of the killings.  Images of bullet casings found by villagers as they scoured the area for their relatives' remains, were shared with CNN. An arms expert told CNN these would normally be used in light machine guns and assault rifles like those seen in the massacre video.   \n\n\"The village couldn't wait any longer, [they were] saying 'we can't get peace unless we bury them'\"\nMahibere Dego resident, June 2021\nCNN used geolocation to verify that the video of the bullet casings was from the same massacre site.CNN also obtained images taken on June 21 that show bones, charred remains, clothes and ID cards at site of the attack. Some of the clothes were also seen in the original video clips investigated by CNN. Families brought the remains they could find to Mariam Megdelawit church, a few kilometers from the massacre site, for an emotional ceremony where they prayed for justice, and to heal their loss on June 21. Video sent to CNN by family members of the victims show the bones of victims being carried into the service in large jute bags and placed together while crowds gathered in a circle around them to mourn and weep.   \"The village couldn't wait any longer, [they were] saying 'we can't get peace unless we bury them,'\" he said. CNN geolocated the footage of the ceremony by matching it to satellite imagery of the area that showed the same church structure, vegetation layout, soil color and topography.  An item of clothing that was left at the scene of the massacre in Mahibere Dego, Tigray.Sunlight in the footage indicates that the burials took place at approximately 9 a.m. This corresponded to the timings stored in metadata, which some of the footage retained.  Many of those targeted in the extrajudicial executions were young men of so-called \"fighting age.\"  One of the young men executed in the massacre was 23-year-old Alula. His brother told CNN he discovered Alula's ID card amid the remains.  CNN first reported on Alula in April when his brothers discovered his fate while watching a TV report about the massacre. At the time, another one of Alula's brothers told CNN it was hard to accept.  Though the family says they have been unable to find his remains, Alula's ID card is enough, they say, to give them some closure.CNN's Oscar Featherstone contributed to this report.

        "content": "(CNN)Hundreds of men in Ethiopia's restive region of Tigray were released on Thursday evening, eyewitnesses and aid workers said, following a CNN report into their detention that prompted international outcry. Speaking to CNN on condition of anonymity, out of fear for their safety, the sources said that the soldiers had released all but a \"handful\" of the men, who were detained on Monday by Ethiopian and Eritrean forces operating in the region. A CNN report published Thursday found that hundreds of men had been rounded up in Shire, a town in Tigray, on Monday this week. Witnesses described, on condition of anonymity, how Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers had beaten and harassed the men. They also said the soldiers broke into at least two shelters for people displaced by the conflict, including an abandoned school, before shouting: \"We'll see if America will save you now!\"One aid worker told CNN that the soldiers had accused the detainees of being members of the Tigray  People's Liberation Front (TPLF), the rebel group leading the resistance against Ethiopian government forces and their allies. \"The soldiers kept telling us they did this because these men were TPLF, but the raid was indiscriminate. How did you know who was TPLF and who wasn't?\" the aid worker said. Read MoreTigrayans told, 'We'll see if America will save you now,' as hundreds rounded up by Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiersA released detainee described physical abuse by Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers while in their custody.\"They take us out one by one and torture us,\" the man said. \"This is the third time I've been beaten by soldiers like this. People here start running and are scared every time they see someone wearing military uniform. The world has to hear our cries and do something -- we are living in terror\"Witnesses and aid workers credit media reports and the ensuing international outcry for the men's release. \"The fact that CNN reported on this, the UN and then Senator [Coons] spoke out about this, it clearly made them know that they are being watched,\" he said, referring to US Senator Chris Coons, who traveled to Ethiopia in March as a personal emissary of President Joe Biden. CNN shared its report with Coons on Thursday. The Senator then raised the issue during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Ethiopia, calling for \"accountability\" for the mass detention. A crowd is seen outside the Guna distribution center on the outskirts of Shire, Ethiopia, in this satellite image captured on May 27. Detainees say they were beaten and tortured at the facility.A US State Department spokesperson on Friday welcomed the news of the detainees' release, but said \"they should never have been detained in the first place.\"\"We remind the government of Ethiopia of its obligations related to protection of civilians, in accordance with International Humanitarian Law,\" the spokesperson said. \"In addition, Eritrean forces must leave Tigray and all those responsible for human rights violations, abuses, and atrocities must be held to account.\"The spokesperson added that \"the atrocities being committed are absolutely unacceptable.\" \"They shock the conscience and must end.\"Babar Baloch, a spokesperson for UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, told reporters in Geneva on Friday that authorities had indicated more detaineeBs would be released in coming days, saying the refugee agency was \"deeply alarmed\" by reports of the detentions. The UN said it was unable to verify this claim independently.\"As the mandated agency lead for protection of internally displaced persons, UNHCR was immediately in contact with the Ethiopian authorities, and we continue to raise urgent concern for the safety of those removed from the camp with the authorities,\" Baloch said.Baloch called on all parties to the conflict to ensure displaced civilians in shelter remain protected there.  How it unfolded Four military vehicles first encircled the Adi Wenfito and Tsehay camps for displaced people, witnesses said, before soldiers began rounding up young men, forcing them onto buses and taking them to a location believed to be on the outskirts of Shire. The soldiers broke into an abandoned school housing the refugees. It was there that witnesses said they shouted, \"We'll see if America will save you now!\" Massacre in the mountains\"They forced open the door, the men didn't even get a chance to put their shoes on. The soldiers had their guns locked, [ready to shoot],\" one witness said. One woman said two of her sons -- aged 19 and 24 -- were dragged from their home at around 9:30 p.m. that night. \"They didn't say why they were taking them, they just rounded them up, beat them and took them away,\" she told CNN, adding that she was too afraid of what would be done to her sons to ask any questions. Several of the men who were rounded up were released late afternoon on Tuesday, after they identified themselves as aid workers. They told CNN hundreds of young men continue to be detained at the Guna distribution center, an aid and foodstuff storage facility which has now been converted into a military camp. One man described hours of beatings by Eritrean and Ethiopian soldiers. \"Many of us are young but there are people there who are much older who won't be able to withstand the beatings much longer,\" he said.

        "content": "(CNN)Days after the United States announced financial sanctions and visa restrictions on Ethiopian and Eritrean officials, eyewitnesses told CNN that hundreds of young men were rounded up from displaced peoples camps in Shire, a town in Tigray, late Monday evening.Witnesses speaking to CNN on condition of anonymity described how Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers invaded at least two IDP centers where they beat and harassed Tigrayans displaced by a conflict that is believed to have killed thousands of civilians since November 2020. The soldiers then took hundreds of people away, the witnesses said Four military vehicles first encircled the Adi Wenfito and Tsehay camps, witnesses said, before soldiers began rounding up young men, forcing them onto buses and taking them to a location believed to be on the outskirts of Shire. As the soldiers broke into an abandoned school housing the refugees, witnesses said they shouted, \"we'll see if America will save you now!\"'Two bullets is enough'\"They forced open the door, the men didn't even get a chance to put their shoes on. The soldiers had their guns locked, [ready to shoot],\" one witness said.One woman said two of her sons -- aged 19 and 24 -- were dragged from their home at around 9:30 p.m. that night. \"They didn't say why they were taking them, they just rounded them up, beat them and took them away,\" she told CNN, adding that she was too afraid of what would be done to her sons to ask any questions. Read MoreSeveral of the men who were rounded up were released late afternoon on Tuesday, after they identified themselves as aid workers. They told CNN hundreds of young men continue to be detained at the Guna distribution center, an aid and foodstuff storage facility which has now been converted into a military camp.

UN confirms military forces blocking aid in Ethiopia's Tigray region following CNN investigationThe UN also condemned Thursday what it described as arbitrary and brutal arrests and called for the immediate release of those detained. \"International humanitarian and human rights law strictly prohibit the arbitrary arrest and ill-treatment of any person,\" said Dr. Catherine Sozi, the UN's humanitarian coordinator in Ethiopia, in a statement. \"Serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law must be promptly investigated, and the perpetrators brought to justice.\"Elisabeth Haslund, spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the agency that works with displaced people, told CNN, \"we have also received very disturbing reports that Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers entered IDP sites taking a number of youths into several vehicles. The reports of how many vary from a few hundred up to 700 youths.\"M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) released a statement on Wednesday that corroborated the eyewitnesses accounts given to CNN. \"On Monday night, scores of people were forcibly taken by military from camps where internally displaced people are seeking refuge in Shire,\" MSF East Africa tweeted. 200 days of violenceThe conflict in Tigray has now raged for over 200 days pitting Tigray's regional leaders, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), against the Ethiopian National Defense Force, Eritrean soldiers and Amhara ethnic militia. From the start of the conflict last year civilians have been targeted by Ethiopian government forces and allied Eritrean and militia forces.This latest incident, however, is a significant escalation in what is described by humanitarian workers and witnesses in Shire as an ongoing, extrajudicial campaign targeting young men perceived to be of \"fighting age.\"'Practically this has been a genocide'Aid agencies estimate the town of Shire has tripled in size, hosting up to 800,000 Tigrayans forced out of their homes in the far west of the region in actions by Ethiopian, Eritrean and Amhara ethnic militia forces described by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken as \"ethnic cleansing.\" Humanitarian workers told CNN Eritrean and Ethiopian soldiers have been blocking a key aid route to Shire for months, restricting supplies even as displaced persons continue to flow into the town.One aid worker told CNN tens of vehicles carrying aid to Shire were turned back on Saturday alone. A CNN team in the region in April was able to capture on camera Eritrean soldiers obstructing aid along this route. CNN has reached out to the Ethiopian Prime Minister's Office and the Eritrean Minister for Information for comment but has not received a response.US sanctions The United States late Sunday evening announced \"far reaching\" financial sanctions and visa restrictions against Ethiopian, Eritrean, Amhara and TPLF officials it finds to be \"complicit\" in abuses or obstructing the resolution of the crisis. A State Department spokesperson told CNN the sanctions would be enforced as a  \"unilateral action\" by the US. CNN has sought comment from the State Department on the latest reports from Shire.In a statement the Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs dismissed the US sanctions. Many witnesses see this latest uptick in violence as a statement of defiance in the face of growing international censure.UN rights chief says war crimes may have been committed in Ethiopia after CNN reveals Tigray massacreIn videos sent to CNN on Tuesday morning, which were secretly filmed, desperate parents can be seen gathering in the compound of the local UNHCR office. In one video Ethiopian soldiers can be seen addressing the parents inside the compound.CNN was able to geolocate the videos to a location in the center of Shire by examining the metadata in the raw files and matching key landmarks in the footage to the surroundings, such as the Kholafaa e Rashedeen mosque. The metadata also revealed the date and time the videos were filmed -- May 25, 2021 at around 7:45am local time -- which fits with the direction of the sunlight and the lengths of the shadows in the video, a CNN analysis shows. One of the videos also features an UNHCR logo supporting the accounts. The audio in the video is indistinct but witnesses say parents were told: \"We could kill you right here and the UN would do nothing to help but take pictures of you.\"This story has been updated.Reporting contributed by DJ Judd.",

        "content": "Axum, Ethiopia \u2014 Eritrean troops are operating with total impunity in Ethiopia's war-torn northern Tigray region, killing, raping and blocking humanitarian aid to starving populations more than a month after the country's Nobel Peace Prize winning leader pledged to the international community that they would leave.A CNN team traveling through Tigray's central zone witnessed Eritrean soldiers, some disguising themselves in old Ethiopian military uniforms, manning checkpoints, obstructing and occupying critical aid routes, roaming the halls of one of the region's few operating hospitals and threatening medical staff. Despite pressure from the Biden administration, there is no sign that Eritrean forces plan to exit the border region anytime soon. On April 21, a CNN team reporting in Tigray with the permission of Ethiopian authorities traveled from the regional capital Mekelle to the besieged city of Axum, two weeks after it had been sealed off by Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers. An aid convoy also made the seven-hour journey. \n\n\n\nCNN team driving into the besieged city of Axum, which remains inaccessible to many aid organizations. Credit: Alex Platt/CNN\nEthiopia's government has severely restricted access to the media until recently, and a state-enforced communications blackout concealed events in the region, making it challenging to gauge the extent of the crisis or verify survivors' accounts. Read MoreBut CNN's interviews with humanitarian workers, doctors, soldiers and displaced people in Axum and across central Tigray -- where up to 800,000 displaced people are sheltering -- indicate the situation is even worse than was feared. Eritrean troops aren't just working hand in glove with the Ethiopian government, assisting in a merciless campaign against the Tigrayan people, in some pockets they're fully in control and waging a reign of terror.The testimonies, shared at great personal risk, present a horrifying picture of the situation in Tigray, where a clash between Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and the region's ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), in November has deteriorated into a protracted conflict that, by many accounts, bears the hallmarks of genocide and has the potential to destabilize the wider Horn of Africa region.Ethiopian security officials working with Tigray's interim administration told CNN that the Ethiopian government has no control over Eritrean soldiers operating in Ethiopia, and that Eritrean forces had blocked roads into central Tigray for over two weeks and in the northwestern part of the region for nearly one month. As the war and its impact on civilians deepens, world leaders have voiced their concern about the role of Eritrean forces in exacerbating what US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, according to spokesperson Ned Price, has described as a \"growing humanitarian disaster.\" In a phone call with Abiy on April 26, Blinken pressed Ethiopia and Eritrea to make good on commitments to withdraw Eritrean troops \"in full, and in a verifiable manner.\"CNN's efforts to reach Axum were thwarted by both Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers multiple times over several days.\n\n\n\n\nOn one of the first attempts, the CNN team encountered what it later learned was the aftermath of a grenade attack, where a group of local residents were flagging down cars, warning passersby not to go any further. But before we reached the scene, a large army truck drove up and parked sideways, blocking the road. Our cameraman got out of the car and started filming only to be confronted by Ethiopian soldiers, who threatened the team with detention, demanding that we hand over the camera and delete the footage. But we refused and were able to conceal the footage until we were eventually released. \n\n\n\nEthiopian soldiers block CNN's path, threatening the team with detention. Credit: Alex Platt/CNN\nOn another occasion, CNN was turned back by an Ethiopian National Defence Force (ENDF) Command operating out of a former USAID distribution center in the outskirts of the city of Adigrat, where several trucks laden with sacks of desperately needed food sat languishing in the hot sun. The aid, bound for communities in Tigray's starved central zone, had been stopped from going any further despite daily phone calls from humanitarian workers pleading for access.Even after being granted entry to Axum by the Ethiopian military, CNN's path was obstructed by Eritrean troops controlling a checkpoint on a desolate mountain top overlooking Adigrat. The forces were wearing a mixture of their official light-colored Eritrean Defence Forces (EDF) fatigues and a woodland camouflage with a green beret, which military experts verified as tallying with old Ethiopian army uniforms.It is one of the first visual confirmations of reports -- relayed in recent weeks by the UN's top humanitarian official Mark Lowcock and US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield -- that Eritrean soldiers are disguising their identities by re-uniforming as Ethiopian military, in what Thomas-Greenfield described as a move to \"remain in Tigray indefinitely.\"  CNN was informed by aid agencies that they had also been turned back by Eritrean soldiers manning the same checkpoint. Ethiopian military sources in the region confirmed to CNN that Eritrean soldiers were in control of key checkpoints along the route to Axum. The military sources said they had requested multiple times for the Eritreans to allow cars and convoys through, but had been refused. CNN has reached out to the Ethiopian and Eritrean governments for comment. Eritrean soldiers are captured on a hidden camera at a checkpoint in the hills above Adigrat, as they block access to the road to Axum. After repeated phone calls to Ethiopian central government and senior military officials, CNN was finally allowed into Axum on its fourth try. On the same day, international medical humanitarian organization Medecins Sans Frontieres demanded that the 12-day blockade of the road into Axum be lifted. Many aid agencies are still being barred from the besieged city, where one of the few hospitals operating for miles is running out of essential supplies, including oxygen and blood, humanitarian workers working in the region told CNN.  On arrival at the Axum University Teaching and Referral Hospital, patients are greeted by a sign asking for blood.The medical staff we spoke to asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, but requested that CNN identify their hospital -- they say that they want people to know that they are still here.Inside one of the under-resourced examination rooms, a malnourished 7-year-old was lying on a gurney, wrapped in a blanket to cushion her fragile skin. Latebrahan's emaciated legs could no longer hold her weight and she lay wide-eyed, staring up at the crowd of doctors gathered around her bed. Seven-year-old Latebrahan lies on a gurney at Axum University Teaching and Referral Hospital, where she's being treated for malnourishment.The medical team were doing their best to keep her alive, but they had run out of a therapeutic feeding agent due to the blockade, the only way to help her gain weight without disturbing her delicate system.  Latebrahan's father, Girmay, who asked to be identified only by his first name, told CNN the journey from their home in Chila, around 60 miles north of Axum, near the border with Eritrea, had been dangerous and costly.\"There is no help, no food, nothing. I didn't have a choice though -- look at her,\" Girmay said. Like many other rural border towns, Chila has been blocked off from receiving aid since the conflict began six months ago. Humanitarian workers say famine could have already arrived there and they would have no way of knowing.\"Based on guesswork there is a sense that in these areas that we are not able to access, out in the countryside for instance, places are falling into pockets of famine. But we're not able to verify that and that's part of the problem,\" Thomas Thompson, the UN World Food Programme's emergency coordinator, told CNN.The fighting erupted during the autumn harvest season following the worst invasion of desert locusts in Ethiopia in decades. The conflict has plunged Tigray even further into severe food insecurity, and the deliberate blockade of food risks mass starvation, a recent report by the World Peace Foundation warned. The Ethiopian government itself estimates that at least 5.2 million people out of 5.7 million in the region are in need of emergency food assistance.USAID distributes supplies in Hawzen, central Tigray, where residents hadn't received aid for two months.Eritrean soldiers have been blocking and looting food relief in multiple parts of Tigray, including in Samre and Gijet, southwest of Mekele, according to a leaked document from the Emergency Coordination Centre of Tigray's Abiy-appointed interim government obtained by CNN. In a PowerPoint presentation dated April 23, the center states that Eritrean soldiers have also started showing up at food distribution points in Tigray, looting supplies after \"our beneficiaries became frightened and [ran] away.\" That report was corroborated by humanitarian workers in Tigray, who said they had \"protection\" issues around distributing aid in some areas as civilians were later robbed of the aid by Eritrean soldiers. Emily Dakin, who leads the USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team in Tigray, also told CNN that she had received reports of health centers being looted, which was \"contributing to some of the dysfunctionality of the hospitals.\"Eritrea's Minister of Information Yemane Meskel has rejected these claims.Hannibal, 7, is treated at Axum Teaching and Referral Hospital for a gunshot wound to the leg, which he received from soldiers' gunfire as he was sitting on his mother's lap.Eritrea's power in the region feels absolute even in the Axum Teaching Hospital, where Eritrean soldiers are among the gun-toting troops roaming the corridors, dropping off wounded soldiers and threatening medical staff. It is a terrifying scene for patients, many of whom say they were injured either directly or indirectly by soldiers.One doctor, who asked not to be named, told CNN that the siege had prompted a surge in patients. In addition to cases of malnutrition like Latebrahan, doctors and nurses are treating a grim array of trauma from shrapnel, bullets, stabbings and rapes. In a desperate attempt to keep pace with demand, medical workers have also begun donating blood.  A sign at Axum University Teaching and Referral Hospital reads: \"Blood Campaign, for mothers, for children, for all those that need it.\"But despite this, there wasn't enough blood on hand to save one young woman, who had been attacked by soldiers who tried to rape her. The doctor treating the woman told CNN that the hospital had seen a spike in sexual assault cases over recent weeks, but that the rise was just \"the tip of the iceberg,\" as many were too scared to seek medical services.An alarming number of women are being gang-raped, drugged and held hostage in the conflict, in which sexual violence is being used as a weapon of war and its use linked to genocide. According to one agency's estimate, almost one-third of all attacks on civilians involve sexual violence, the majority committed by men in uniform.  An autopsy photo of the young woman seen by CNN showed her internal organs spilling out from a wound in her lower abdomen.\"She came to our emergency department and she had a sign of life initially. [But] if you find blood for a patient, it's only one or two units and one or two units could not save this woman. She bled [out] and she died,\" the doctor said haltingly, overcome with emotion.He took a deep breath, then added, \"I see this woman in my dreams.\"This reporting would not have been possible without the support of dozens of Tigrayans, who shared their stories at great personal risk. CNN is not naming them to protect their safety. It also builds on a series of investigations into massacres and sexual violence in Tigray by CNN's Bethlehem Feleke, Gianluca Mezzofiore and Katie Polglase.

        "content": "Hodeidah, Yemen (CNN)When 10-month-old Hassan Ali arrived at the hospital, doctors were hopeful they could save him. So many children in northern Yemen, after all, don't even get this far, starved not only of food but also the fuel needed just to reach medical help.CNN watched overstretched doctors and nurses as they tried to give oxygen to Hassan, who had arrived six days earlier but wasn't putting on any weight, and was struggling to breathe. Just hours later, Hassan died. \"He is just one of many cases,\" said Dr. Osman Salah. The ward is full of children suffering from malnutrition, including babies just weeks old. Ten-month-old Hassan Ali, who died in a hospital in Abs, Yemen, where he was being treated for malnutrition.Every month, this hospital's pediatric ward takes in more patients than its capacity of 50, sometimes twice as many. Around 12 children die there each month, Salah said. He and his staff are running on empty -- they haven't been paid for more than half a year. Yemen has stepped up to the precipice of famine, and back again, many times over its six years of war. Now, famine conditions not seen in the country for two years have returned to pockets of the country. Read MoreAn estimated 47,000 people are likely to be living with \"catastrophic\" levels of food insecurity -- or famine-like conditions -- according to an analysis by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), the world's authority on food security. A further 16 million are living in either \"crisis\" or \"emergency\" food security conditions, the analysis shows. That's more than half of Yemen's population.    \n\nThe rapidly deteriorating situation is the result mostly of funding cuts that have battered activities by agencies like the World Food Programme, which is struggling now to meet the most basic of needs for millions of Yemenis, particularly in the country's north. But it has also been exacerbated by a mounting fuel crisis. Staff at the hospital in Abs, where baby Hassan lost his life, say they will have to shut in less than three weeks if they don't receive more funding and fuel to keep their generators going. It's the same story all over the north.\"If fuel were easily available on the market, the number of cases we are seeing in the hospital would be much higher, because at the moment, there are patients who are staying at home, because of the challenges and expenses of traveling to the hospital,\" Dr. Salah said. As a result, said Dr. Salah, children are simply dying in their homes. A bitter blockadeFuel typically comes into the country's north via the port of Hodeidah, usually bustling with economic activity at the best of times. Even during Yemen's ongoing civil war, it has been a lively gateway for the conflict economy, where food and other aid that Yemenis rely on arrive.But the port is now a ghost town. Hundreds of food aid trucks sit parked in a line stretching for miles along a dusty road. A cavernous tank that usually stores some 2,500 metric tons of oil sits empty at the port. It lets off an echoey clang with the softest touch.Trucks lined up on a road outside Hodeidah, fully laden but with no fuel to leave.Saudi warships have not allowed any oil tankers to berth at Hodeidah since the start of the year, the Houthis say, an assertion backed by the World Food Programme. The practice is starving the north of much-needed fuel. Since 2015, Saudi Arabia has been militarily supporting the internationally recognized Yemeni government, which is now operating in exile from Riyadh.The Saudi vessels that patrol the waters of Hodeidah have control over which commercial ships can dock and unload their cargo. Some goods are getting through -- CNN witnessed aid being loaded on to trucks at the port after being delivered by ship -- but not any fuel to deliver them. CNN obtained documents from the port's arrival log showing that 14 vessels had been cleared by the UN's verification and inspection body to carry fuel to the country. The tracking website MarineTraffic.com shows those vessels are now sitting in the Red Sea between the Saudi-Yemen border and Eritrea, unable to unload their fuel. The UN has previously accused the Houthis of siphoning hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel taxes earmarked to pay civil servants. Nonetheless, the UN has reiterated that agencies still need to operate in the north, where the need is greatest. The port of Hodeidah's fuel storage facility, running dry. The last shipment of oil arrived on December 30 last year. Houthi officials tell CNN that they are being fined millions of dollars by the companies that own the ships while they are unable to dock.Nearly three years ago the UN Security Council criminalized \"intentionally using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare,\" and demanded that \"access to supplies that are necessary for food preparation, including water and fuel\" be kept intact in northern Yemen.   Prince Abdullah bin Khaled bin Sultan Al Saud, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the UN  in Vienna, blamed the Houthis for the issue while speaking to CNN on Thursday.\"Saudi Arabia has always looked for political solution in Yemen. Saudi Arabia has been committed to the ceasefire in the past year. Unfortunately, the Houthis have not,\" the ambassador said while talking to CNN's Becky Anderson.The World Health Organization, which provides critical funding to hospitals and clinics, says it has been left with no funding at all to secure fuel to carry out its services across Yemen.\"From March 2021, WHO will have to stop distributing fuel to 206 facilities across the country, over 60 percent are hospitals providing services not available at the already fragile primary level. This will lead to the stoppage of life-saving services, such as emergency rooms and intensive care units, including COVID-19 ICUs. Over 9 million people will be affected,\" it said in a document, shared with CNN. The Saudi-backed Yemeni government has repeatedly denied CNN visas to enter the country's north after coverage last year that exposed Saudi Arabia's dramatic drop in humanitarian funding for the war. CNN traveled at night by boat from east Africa to reach the Houthi-controlled north, where a Saudi blockade has contributed to widescale suffering and enormous food security challenges. Saudi Arabia has been targeting Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen since 2015, with the support of the US and other Western allies. It had hoped to stem the Houthis' spread of power and influence in the country by backing the internationally-recognized government under President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi. The Houthis continue to hit Saudi targets with missiles from within Yemen and drone attacks.   Can Biden turn the war?The dynamics of the conflict, however, appear to be rapidly changing. In February, US President Joe Biden announced a new Yemen strategy, giving momentum to the search for a ceasefire and eventual political solution.There are few concrete details yet of his policy, but central to his announcement was the US' withdrawal of offensive support for Saudi Arabia. \"The US historically has not viewed Yemen as an independent sovereign nation in its own right. The US has treated Yemen as an extension of either the US-Saudi policy or the US-Iranian crisis,\" said Munir Saeed, former president of a Yemeni pro-democracy group TAWQ, at a Yemen briefing held by Fair Observer last week.He welcomed the change in direction, saying the Biden strategy was the first from the US to put Yemen's interests at its center.\"Dealing with Yemen as a country by itself that has its own problems, and cutting it away from the problems of Saudi-Iranian problems ... is very important to lead to peace.\"JUST WATCHED2020: World's worst humanitarian crisis deepens after US aid cutsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH2020: World's worst humanitarian crisis deepens after US aid cuts 06:27The Obama administration was supportive of Saudi Arabia's intervention in Yemen in 2015 and offered the Kingdom arms deals worth more than $115 billion total, more than any other US administration in the history of US-Saudi relations, according to a report by the Center for International Policy.It later imposed restrictions on the sale of certain arms to Riyadh, including precision-guided munitions, after reports of civilian casualties in several Saudi-led airstrikes. The Trump administration reversed some of those restrictions, though he faced constant challenges in Congress. As part of his new approach, Biden also appointed a special envoy for Yemen, Tim Lenderking, who is wrapping up a two-week visit to region, trying to engage different parties and give mediation efforts a reboot.  There will be limitations to how much the Biden administration can achieve, and ultimately, a ceasefire will depend on Yemeni actors on the ground.And the Houthis are showing little appetite of slowing down, still launching missiles and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia, which has been responding with airstrikes. The Houthis said last week they had also seized control of 10 out of 14 districts of the strategic northern city of Marib. On the back of his Gulf trip, Lenderking told CNN that Saudi Arabia and its allied Yemeni government were ready to agree to a ceasefire, and called on the Houthis to end their cross-border strikes and assault on Marib. \"They are ready to sit down to negotiate an end to the conflict with all relevant parties, including Ansarallah, sometimes referred to as the Houthis, during which access to ports and other issues could be addressed and resolved quickly,\" he said, using the group's formal name, in an emailed response to CNN's questions.When asked about US support for Saudi Arabia while the country was blocking fuel deliveries to Hodeidah, Lenderking said the situation was \"complex.\"\"On fuel, we need to be clear where the problem lies,\" he said, pointing to a UN accusation against the Houthis that they had siphoned fuel taxes earmarked to pay Yemeni civil servants to fund its war effort as the main reason the fuel tankers have been barred from docking. \"Instead, Ansarallah diverted them to their war effort, which they continue to fund with revenues from diverted imports and port revenues.\"The old city of the capital, Sana'a. Houthi rebels control Sana'a after forcing the internationally recognized government out.Lenderking said the US was urging the Yemeni government to work with the UN around the impasse to ensure that aid continues to flow where it's needed and that a fuel shortage doesn't worsen the situation.In Yemen, CNN met with Mohammed Ali Al-Houthi, a senior Houthi leader, who said his group was willing to come to the negotiating table but wanted to see more action from the US first before it put trust in Biden.  \"First of all, President Biden was a partner of President Obama, and during that time they declared that they would join the coalition against our country. They also agreed about and gave the green light for the coalition to continue perpetuating the killing in our country,\" he said.  \"Trust is created by actions not words. Trust must come about by decisions. So far, we have not seen any concrete decisions being made.\" Aid agency's plead for action now A political solution, or at least an initial ceasefire, would go a long way in addressing the country's food security problems.\"Ultimately, until there's an end to the war, we are doing what we can to save lives. But Yemen needs peace,\" said the World Food Programme's Yemen spokesperson Annabel Symington.In April last year, the WFP said it was forced to cut every second monthly food aid delivery to 8 million people in Yemen's north. It's now hoping to raise $1.9 billion, which will be enough just to avert widescale famine.

A pledging conference on March 1 garnered less than half the $3.85 billion the UN estimates it needs just to keep the country fed and running. Philippe Duamelle, the Yemen representative for UNICEF, is making an urgent plea for donors to step up their pledges, warning that 2.3 million children under the age of 5 in Yemen are projected to suffer acute malnutrition this year, up 16% from 2020.\"The children of Yemen cannot wait, we've got to be able to assist them and save them now. The situation has deteriorated significantly, and we need to reverse the trends now,\" he said.But in all humanitarian disasters, there are glimmers of hope.

        "content": "(CNN)The ousted leader of Ethiopia's Tigray region has accused the federal government and its Eritrean allies of genocide and other crimes against humanity, calling on US President Joe Biden to dial up the pressure against \"invader forces.\"In a rare and exclusive interview with CNN, President of the Tigray People's Liberation Front Debretsion Gebremichael called for an independent probe into alleged killings, rape and violence, including those revealed in a CNN investigation published on Friday last week. Eyewitnesses told CNN that a group of Eritrean soldiers opened fire in November on Maryam Dengelat church in Dengelat village, in Tigray's east, while hundreds of congregants were celebrating mass. Dozens of people died over three days of mayhem, with soldiers slaughtering local residents, displaced people and pilgrims, they said.Massacre in the mountainsThousands of civilians are believed to have been killed since Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed launched a military operation against leaders in the Tigray region, sending in troops from the neighboring Amhara region. CNN has previously reported that soldiers from neighboring Eritrea have perpetrated many of the extrajudicial killings, assaults and human rights abuses in the Tigray region.After seizing control of Tigray's main cities in late November, Abiy declared victory and maintained that no civilians were harmed in the offensive.Read More\"They are killing our people in this country, they are killing children, all ages of the population and they are conducting rape,\" Debretsion told CNN in a phone interview from an undisclosed location.\"All sorts of acts of genocide have been committed in Tigray. So, the most important thing is that an investigation must be conducted,\" he added. \"We are calling for an investigation into the CNN findings on the ground in Tigray.\" Ousted Tigray leader Debretsion Gebremichael in Mekelle, Ethiopia, on June 8, 2019.Ethiopia's foreign ministry on Monday rejected a call from the United States for the Ethiopian federal government to pull forces out of Tigray, saying it was \"regrettable\" that the US had attempted \"to make pronouncements on Ethiopia's internal affairs and specifically, the reference to the Amhara regional forces redeployment.\" \"It should be clear that such matters are the sole responsibility of the Ethiopian government, which as a sovereign nation, is responsible to deploy the necessary security structures and means available in ensuring the rule of law within all corners of its borders,\" the ministry said in a statement.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday that the US was \"gravely concerned by reported atrocities and the overall deteriorating situation,\" and called for Eritrean and Amhara regional forces to withdraw immediately. Blinken's statement came one day after CNN's investigation, as well as another by Amnesty International, both detailing eyewitness accounts of civilian massacres in two separate assaults in late 2020.  Ethiopian refugees fleeing Tigray line up to receive supplies at the Um Rakuba camp in Sudan's eastern Gedaref province, on November 16, 2020.Eritrea's government denied involvement in the atrocities reported by Amnesty, but has yet to respond to CNN's request for comment in relation to the Dengelat massacre. Debretsion said he was making an urgent call to the Biden administration to keep the pressure on the Ethiopian and Eritrean governments.\"We want to have peace in this region, in this country so we want [the US] to continue to push [for the withdrawal] of invader forces from Tigray to stop the atrocities, genocide and destruction,\" he told CNN.  \"We need, you know, humanitarian assistance as well ... The whole Tigray is in social and economic crisis. Our people need assistance, they need humanitarian support. So, it's an urgent call. We need this push from the [US] President.\"Repeated denials of Eritrean involvementThe Amnesty International report charged that Eritrean forces killed hundreds of unarmed civilians in the city of Axum, also in Tigray region, in November through indiscriminate shelling and shooting and extrajudicial killings, in what the human rights organization said could amount to a crime against humanity.The Ethiopian foreign ministry's statement Monday did not mention the presence of forces from neighboring Eritrea during the recent offensive. It added that it was \"fully committed\" to investigating any human rights violations. Prime Minister Abiy has also denied that soldiers from Eritrea crossed into Tigray to support Ethiopian forces.Blinken had called for a \"full, independent international investigation into all reports of human rights violations, abuses and atrocities.\"US calls for withdrawal of Eritrean forces in Ethiopia following investigation into massacre\"We strongly condemn the killings, forced removals and displacements, sexual assaults, and other extremely serious human rights violations and abuses by several parties that multiple organizations have reported in Tigray,\" he said.Blinken also acknowledged Abiy's stated commitment to allow humanitarian aid to the region, and said that the US Agency for International Development would send a disaster assistance response team to Ethiopia. On Monday, Ethiopia's foreign ministry said it was working to ensure unfettered access to Tigray for the delivery of humanitarian assistance.TPLF troops seized power in Ethiopia in 1991 with the backing of Eritrea, and the TPLF's Meles Zenawi became the nation's leader. Debretsion became deputy prime minister after Zenawi's death in 2012. The TPLF ruled until 2018, when members of the Oromo and Amhara ethnic groups united against the party. Abiy was appointed prime minister in 2018 and won a Nobel prize last year for his peace deal with Eritrea.Violence flared in the region last year after Tigray went ahead with local elections that the Abiy government had banned because of the pandemic.An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the year Debretsion became Deputy Prime Minister. It was in 2012.CNN's Angela Dewan, Emmet Lyons, Bethlehem Feleke, Gianluca Mezzofiore and Katie Polglase contributed to this report.",

As he enters Sudan, fleeing Ethiopia's Tigray province, border guards direct him to the first aid tent nearby. The medical facilities here are basic and Huyeet grimaces as the grimy dressing is unraveled, revealing a gunshot wound. Huyeet is 24, and like many of the people CNN met as they crossed the border, he refuses to give his surname. Even here, so far from home, he says he feels unsafe. Huyeet says that when the Ethiopian Army captured his hometown, Humera, its soldiers reassured Huyeet and those with him that they would be safe.  Read MoreThen the Ethiopian troops withdrew. Forces from Ethiopia's Tigray region say Eritrean troops are part of the conflict and the war is far from over\"The Amhara militia [Fano] came and I was shot in my leg with a bullet and as I fell on the ground the blood of the other wounded bodies splashed onto my face,\" Huyeet said.   \"As the militiamen came to inspect the bodies to see who was living and who was dead, they saw that I was covered with blood,\" he recalled. \"They thought I was dead, so they threw me into a stream.\" Huyeet said he was saved by a group of Tigray refugees, who fished him out of the water and bandaged his leg. \"The Fano, they left me for dead,\" he told CNN, as medics cleaned his wound. The Fano are an ethnic Amhara militia which is allied with the Ethiopian Army.  A spokeswoman for the Ethiopian government denied the existence of the \"Fano\" Amhara militia but -- confusingly -- did acknowledge that \"the militia of the Amhara Region were engaged to the extent of securing border towns between the two regions.\" The Hamdayat refugee camp in Sudan borders Ethiopia.Violence against civiliansIt's very hard to know what is happening in Ethiopia's Tigray region, because the government has endorsed a communications blackout. A CNN team at the Sudan-Ethiopia border spent days gathering testimony from refugees who say they were targeted because of their Tigray ethnicity. The conflict in Tigray, between the Tigray Peoples Liberation Forces (TPLF) and the government of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, began in early November. Capital of Ethiopia's Tigray region under control of Ethiopian forces, says PM after intense bombardmentNobel laureate Abiy has accused Tigray's leaders of undermining his democratic reforms.According to the United Nations, 45,000 refugees have crossed into neighboring Sudan since he vowed \"military confrontation\" with Tigray. The UN expects as many as 100,000 people to flee over the next six months, describing the situation as a \"full-scale humanitarian crisis.\"JUST WATCHEDWhy are there fears of civil war in Ethiopia?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhy are there fears of civil war in Ethiopia? 03:07International leaders have repeatedly expressed grave concern for the disruption of humanitarian access and for violence against civilians during fighting in the regional capital, Mekelle.  Ethiopian National Defense Forces (ENDF) took control of Mekelle, which is home to half a million residents -- half of whom are children -- late last month. The Ethiopian government has denied bombing civilian areas and accused TPLF forces of sheltering in schools, churches and mosques. CNN has not been permitted to travel to Ethiopia's Tigray region by the Ethiopian government, although we have requested access. A young mother and her newborn baby rest at the Hamdayat camp. She fled violence in Humera, an Ethiopian town near the border.CNN is not able to independently verify Huyeet's story but all the refugees we spoke to told a similar story.  Again, and again, they described how the Ethiopian army enters a town and tells civilians that they are safe. Then the Ethiopian soldiers leave, and other armed groups arrive. Ethnic cleansing fearsUnlike Huyeet, Zeray Gabrgeorgis asked that we publish his name in full -- he was separated from the rest of his family as they fled his hometown and fears the worst. He doesn't believe he has anything left to lose. At least 600 civilians were killed in northern Ethiopia massacre, rights commission says  Gabrgeorgis says that in his town -- Sheraro on the Eritrea-Ethiopia border -- the Eritrean military took over when Ethiopian troops left. \"They beat us with the machine guns, they would make us lie on the ground and put the weapon in our mouths,\" he said. \"If you are afraid, they will kill you, and if you don't show fear, they turn you on your back and hit you with the back of the rifle.\"An Ethiopian government spokeswoman did not specifically deny refugees' claims that Eritrean soldiers were involved but dismissed their claims as propaganda spread by regional Tigray forces. \"The people of Tigray, under Tigray People's Liberation Front's oppressive rule, have been consistently fed a 'fear of the other' propaganda over the past three decades,\" she said.CNN attempted to reach the Eritrean government for comment but was unsuccessful. People sleep outside at the camp.The testimonies -- if true -- speak to growing fears that the month-old hostilities in Ethiopia could draw in other regional actors.  They also raise concerns that it could descend into an ethnic conflict.  Western diplomats based in the region, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of exacerbating the situation on the ground, told CNN their biggest fear is that the conflict could descend into ethnic cleansing.  \"How do you say you didn't know, when all the signs are there -- clear as day,\" wondered one diplomat, voicing a frustration common among Western governments' representatives there. \"But how do you even begin to stop this?\"",
