        "content": "Story highlights Turkish foreign minister, Tillerson spoke WednesdayBoth nations have suspended all mutual non-immigrant visa servicesIstanbul, Turkey (CNN)The US ambassador to Turkey has slammed the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan over the arrest of a consular staff member.The detention last week of Turkish national Metin Topuz, who works for the US Consulate in Istanbul, sparked a sudden deterioration in relations and prompted Washington to suspend all its non-immigrant visa services in the country. Ankara responded by doing the same.Topuz was arrested on terrorism charges, but little else is known about the allegations against him. US Ambassador John Bass complained Wednesday that Turkey had left the United States in the dark as to why he was detained.\"There are ... times that our two governments do not seem to be eye to eye (on) specific aspects of our bilateral relationship. We are observing one of those this week as a result of actions the Turkish government took against some of our local staff,\" Bass said at a news conference in Ankara.In the crosshairs: The Americans detained in TurkeyHe said it was difficult to comment on Topuz's case \"because again there has been no official communication from the Turkish government regarding these matters for the ostensible evidences.\"Read MoreHe added that accusing US consular employees of terror-related crimes was \"a very serious allegation.\" His comments are the latest in a terse exchange of words to mark deteriorating relations between the United States and Turkey.Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu spoke to US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Wednesday for the first time since the visa crisis began, Turkish foreign ministry sources told CNN.State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Tillerson \"conveyed to the foreign minister his profound concern over the detentions of Turkish national employees of our diplomatic mission to Turkey and of several American citizens.\"  The two NATO allies have feuded over several issues, including the United States' refusal to extradite Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen. Gulen lives in exile in Pennsylvania and Turkey blames him for coordinating an attempted military coup last year. There have also been complaints by Ankara over Washington's support for Kurdish fighters in Syria. Ankara considers them terrorists while Washington sees them as the backbone of Syria's anti-ISIS forces.And now a string of arrests of US citizens -- as well as Turkish nationals working for the US mission -- has become a new wedge between the countries. Erdogan snubs BassWashington's visa freeze has caused ire in Ankara, and Bass' comments come a day after President Erdogan said he would no longer recognize Bass as the US' representative. Bass is an outgoing ambassador and will soon take up a new post in Afghanistan.Erdogan: Turkey does not recognize US ambassador after visa spat\"In fact, this ambassador is doing his farewell visits,\" Ergodan said Tuesday. \"And right now, be it our Cabinet ministers, parliament head -- and I personally am not accepting his farewell visit, and will not do so, because we do not see him as a representative of the United States in Turkey -- let me say that clearly.\"But Bass defended the visa freeze Wednesday as a necessary measure while trying to calm the waters. \"It is important to reiterate that it was not a decision we took lightly. It was a decision that we took with a great deal of sadness,\" he said.The ambassador said, however, that he was willing to work with Turkish officials to resolve the problem quickly. Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said Wednesday that he hoped relations with Washington would normalize soon. \"We will not abandon common sense about the the visa crisis with USA. Our hope is the relations will go back to normal shortly,\" he said, state media reported. Spate of US-linked arrestsThe United States has been rattled by the arrests of US citizens and its consular staff, detained as the government continues with a widespread purge after the coup attempt.The Rev. Andrew Brunson is among US citizens detained in Turkey. Turkey is also holding an American pastor, Andrew Brunson, whom Erdogan has suggested could be exchanged for Gulen. It appears that foreign journalists are now being targeted as well. A Wall Street Journal reporter, Ayla Albayrak, was sentenced in absentia Tuesday to two years in prison for spreading \"terrorist propaganda.\" The case was brought forward over her coverage of a Kurdish militant insurgency, according to the Wall Street Journal. Albayrak is a dual Turkish-Finnish national and is now in New York.And on Wednesday, German journalist Mesale Tolu went on trial for terror offenses and could face 15 years in prison if convicted.German journalist Mesale Tolu has been detained for more than five months in a Turkish prison. She is charged with being a member of the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party -- labeled in her indictment as an \"armed terror organization\" -- and with spreading \"terrorist propaganda.\"She has been in prison for more than five months with her young son. Her child's father was also detained. Eleven Germans are being held in Turkey for political reasons, the German Foreign Ministry has said. Chancellor Angela Merkel has described the arrests as \"unjustified\" and repeatedly called for the prisoners' release.While not commenting on specific cases, Turkish officials said charges against Turkish and foreign journalists are usually linked to their membership in \"terrorist organizations\" or their creation of \"propaganda\" on their behalf. At least 81 journalists are behind bars in Turkey, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali and Nadine Schmidt contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Spain's deepening political crisis came to a head Friday when the central government moved to dismiss the top leaders in Catalonia and dissolve the regional Parliament, an action taken not long after the Catalan government finally made a formal declaration of independence.The standoff over Catalonia, the richest of Spain's 17 regions, has plunged one of the European Union's biggest countries into its worst political crisis since the restoration of democracy in the 1970s.It was triggered by Catalan leaders pushing ahead with an independence referendum on October 1 that was declared illegal by Spain's highest court and marred by a violent crackdown by national police.Here's what we know about what comes next and how we got here.      What happened?Read MoreAfter weeks of uncertainty, the Catalan government led by President Carles Puigdemont voted in favor of a unilateral declaration of independence from Spain.The vote came almost a month after the disputed independence referendum, which was banned by Spain's top court and marred by a violent police crackdown.It was the culmination of a yearslong effort by secessionists in Catalonia, one of the richest regions in Spain.Some 90% voted in favor of independence in the referendum, but turnout was only 43%. The secessionist movement has deeply divided Catalonia.Shortly after the vote in the Catalan Parliament on Friday, the Spanish Senate in Madrid voted in favor of imposing direct rule on Catalonia, under the provisions of Article 155 of the Spanish constitution. The provisions have never before been enacted.Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy then dismissed Catalonia's president and cabinet, dissolved its parliament, called a new regional election for December 21 and took over the functions of the administration in Barcelona. The head of the Catalan regional police force, Josep Lluis Trapero, and the force's director general, Pere Soler, were also sacked.Rajoy appointed Deputy Prime Minister Soraya S\u00e1enz de Santamar\u00eda to take charge of the region.International reaction against the Catalonian independence movement was swift.The European Union has made it clear that it does not support the move, fearing breakaway movements in other member states. In any case, under EU rules, Catalonia would not be a member of the EU on its own, and would have to apply for membership from outside the bloc.Germany, France, the United Kingdom and the United States issued statements saying they would not recognize the independence of Catalonia.The Scottish government said Catalans \"must have the ability to determine their own future\" and Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs Fiona Hyslop said the \"imposition of direct rule cannot be the solution. ...\" A referendum for Scottish independence from the UK failed in 2014.What comes next? It is not clear how such a changeover would happen in practice: whether the Catalan government would voluntarily give up its powers or whether officers from Spain's national Guardia Civil would have to remove them from office forcibly.Catalan lawmakers vote to split from Spain amid independence crisisCatalonia's main opposition group called on civil servants to peacefully resist against orders from Madrid.Article 155 of the 1978 Spanish constitution has never been used before. It allows the central government to take back control of regions, such as Catalonia and the Basque Country, that were granted sweeping freedoms after the 1975 downfall of the Franco dictatorship, if they act beyond the law or threaten the national interest.The Madrid government said it was moving ahead with triggering Article 155 to protect the interests of all Spanish people, including Catalans. \"Spain is a serious country and a great nation and we will not tolerate that a few people try liquidate our constitution,\" Rajoy told journalists on Friday.  How did we get here?Rajoy (L) brought about the removal of Puigdemont (R) and other Catalan leaders.More than 2.25 million people turned out to cast their ballot in the October 1 referendum, with the regional government reporting that 90% of voters were in favor of a split from Madrid. But the turnout was low -- around 43% of the voter roll -- which Catalan officials blamed on the central government's efforts to stop the vote.National police launched a concerted effort to prevent people from casting their ballots. That sparked violent clashes that left almost 900 people injured, according to Catalan officials. The scenes shocked Catalans and reverberated around Europe. Madrid's representative to Catalonia later apologized for the violence.The Catalans who oppose a split from SpainKing Felipe intervened on the side of Madrid, saying Catalan leaders had acted \"outside the law.\" Puigdemont had hoped Felipe would mediate the dispute.When Catalan officials called on the EU to intervene, Brussels backed Madrid. Catalan Police Chief Josep Llu\u00eds Trapero has appeared in a Madrid court along with two leading figures in the Catalan independence movement to answer allegations of sedition. Hundreds of thousands of people have marched in the streets of Barcelona, calling for unity and talks between Rajoy and Puigdemont.And in an indication of the uncertainty surrounding Catalonia, several major banks and a number of other companies announced they would move their head offices to other parts of Spain, threatening stability in the country's most economically productive region. What's the history?Catalans have their own language, which is based on the romance Latin-based tongues of southern Europe but is quite different from Spanish, which was influenced by the Arabs who ruled huge swathes of medieval Spain. Several times during its history, Catalonia has found itself caught between the rivalries of France and Spain. The region industrialized before the rest of Spain and had strong anarchist, socialist and communist movements that all fought against General Francisco Franco in the 1936-1939 Spanish Civil War. Franco repressed Catalonia's earlier limited autonomy, and in the early years of the dictatorship at least, expressions of Catalan language and culture. It wasn't until four years after Franco's 1975 death that the region regained some of that autonomy. Catalan independence vote caps four centuries of mistrustIn 2006, the Spanish government backed Catalonia's calls for even greater powers, granting \"nation\" status and financial control to the region. But four years later, the Constitutional Court rescinded that status, ruling that while Catalan is a \"nationality,\" Catalonia itself is not a nation.One of Spain's 17 autonomous provinces, Catalonia has its own regional government with considerable powers over healthcare, education and tax collection. But it pays taxes to Madrid, and pro-independence politicians argue that complex mechanisms for redistributing tax revenue are unfair to wealthier areas, something that has helped stoke resentment.\u00a0The region accounts for a fifth of Spain's economy producing 25% of the country's exports. It contributes much more in taxes (21% of the country's total) than it gets back from the government.In a symbolic poll in 2014, 80% of Catalan voters backed complete secession -- but only 32% of the electorate turned out.CNN's Laura Smith-Spark, Angela Dewan and Vasco Cotovio and CNN Money's Alana Petroff also contributed to this report.",

Falling 2-1 to Trinidad and Tobago, the US failed to qualify for Russia 2018. An early own-goal from Omar Gonzalez set the tone for the defeat, before Alvin Jones doubled the Trinidad and Tobago lead on 37 minutes. Despite a fightback, which included a goal straight after the half-time break from 19-year-old Christian Pulisic, American hearts were to be broken, with the defeat plunging the Americans into fifth place in the CONCACAF table.

But the wins by Panama and Honduras, coupled with their unexpected loss to the last-placed CONCACAF team in Couva, dropped the US team to fifth.The Panamanians' 2-1 victory saw them in third place and guaranteed them a debut World Cup appearance in Russia next year, alongside fellow regional qualifiers Costa Rica, who finished second, and Mexico, who topped the table.

        "content": "Barcelona (CNN)The leader of Catalonia postponed a formal declaration of independence from Spain on Tuesday, stepping back from the brink of a constitutional crisis that has engulfed one of Europe's richest nations.Catalonia's independence standoff: How we got here and what comes nextCarles Puigdemont, the Catalan President, declared that the region had \"earned the right\" to independence from Madrid. But he told the Catalan parliament in Barcelona that he wanted to take the heat out of the political standoff that has roiled Spain since a disputed referendum on October 1.\"With the result of the referendum on the first of October, Catalonia has earned the right to be an independent state. It has earned the right to be heard and respected,\" Puigdemont told deputies in the Catalan parliament. \"I defend the mandate of the people of Catalonia to become an independent republic,\" he said, to applause from the chamber.But he added that parliament should suspend a formal declaration in order to pursue dialogue. He did not specify what form the talks would take, or who would mediate them. Puigdemont and other deputies then signed what amounted to a symbolic declaration of independence. Pro-independence supporters watch Catalan President Carles Puigdemont's speech on a big screen in Barcelona.Read MoreSpain's Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria dismissed Puigdemont's actions, saying: \"The speech of the President of Catalonia is of someone who doesn't know where he is going and what he wants to do.\"Puigdemont cannot impose mediation on Madrid, she said.  \"Dialogue in democracy is done by the rules and not inventing them as you please,\" she told reporters.  Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called an extraordinary Cabinet meeting for Wednesday morning.  Rajoy has previously refused to hold talks unless Puigdemont drops his independence claim. Spain was plunged into political uncertainty after the divisive and controversial referendum found 90% of Catalan voters in favor of independence. But the result was not as decisive it appeared -- turnout was only 43% as many Catalans stayed at home. The referendum was declared illegal by Spain's top court.Tuesday's highly anticipated parliamentary session was delayed for just over an hour amid reports that last-minute attempts at international mediation were underway. Puigdemont said Catalonia was living through a \"historic moment\" that would have repercussions throughout Europe. \"The consequences and effects go well beyond our country,\" he said. He defended the right of Catalans to express their views. \"We are not criminals,\" he said. \"We are not crazy. We are not making a coup d'\u00e9tat ... We are normal people who wish to have a vote.\" Catalan President Carles Puigdemont speaks at the Catalan Parliament in Barcelona.But he also talked about dialogue, de-escalation and peace just nine days after Spanish police tried to shut the vote down by firing rubber bullets and pulling voters from polling booths in scenes that shocked many across Europe.\"If everyone acts responsibly the conflict can be revolved in a calm manner,\" he said.Madrid and the European Union had earlier implored Puigdemont not make a unilateral declaration of independence. The Spanish government had warned Puigdemont not to take any \"irreversible\" action.After the speech, the head of the Catalan branch of the anti-independence Ciutadans party, Ines Arrimadas, accused Puigdemont of dividing the region. \"The people of Catalonia are not united, thanks to you,\" she said, alluding to Puigdemont's claim that the region was united behind the idea of independence. \"Most Catalans believe that Catalonia is their land, Spain is their country and Europe their future,\" Arrimadas said after Puigdemont stopped short of a full declaration of independence Tuesday.     Italy's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Angelino Alfano, on Tuesday joined other European leaders in urging Puigdemont to enter talks with Madrid \"aimed at safeguarding the unity of the country.\"\"Italy therefore considers the unilateral declaration of independence unacceptable and rejects any escalation,' Alfano said in a statement. \"We express our confidence in the Spanish Government's ability to protect constitutional order and legality and, consequently, to ensure respect for the rights of all citizens.\"Earlier, European Council President Donald Tusk urged Puigdemont to back down. \"The force of arguments is always better than the argument of force,\" he said in Brussels.Ada Colau, mayor of Barcelona and an influential figure who has been critical of both sides and has called for de-escalation, thanked Puigdemont on Twitter for choosing \"dialogue and mediation\" and said it was now up to \"Rajoy and other other political forces to make a move.\" In Barcelona, some Catalans expressed mixed feelings after watching the speech on big screens at Ciutadella Park. \"I'm in shock,\" Angels Grabulosa, 34, said. \"It's not the declaration we expected. I don't know what's going to happen now. We are now just waiting to make sense of it all.\" Grabulosa said she expected a full declaration of independence, but added, \"I hope that what starts now is a constituent  process to start our new constitution and new state.\"Maria Miro, 31, said the timeline of the independence process was disappointing. \"It is too early to tell,\" said Miro, holding the flag of Catalonia. \"The people that return home will have to come back out to the streets and revindicate what we have done until now. The referendum was won by a majority. A lot of people want independence and now to prolong it is a mistake.\"Natalie Gall\u00f3n reported from Barcelona. Ray Sanchez wrote from Atlanta.",

        "content": "Barcelona (CNN)Catalonia is prepared to enter into a dialogue on independence from Spain \"without preconditions,\" Catalan President Carles Puigdemont told CNN on Wednesday, as the Madrid government took the first steps to imposing direct rule on the region.Speaking a day after he appeared to delay a formal declaration of independence, Puigdemont struck a conciliatory tone, saying he favored mediation to resolve the crisis.But Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy gave Puigdemont five days to clarify whether he had made a declaration of independence or not, after which Madrid could take over the Catalan government.On Tuesday Puigdemont delivered an ambiguous speech to the Catalan parliament, saying that Catalonia had won the right to declare a republic following a disputed October 1 referendum. But he said the declaration would be suspended, in order to allow for dialogue.Catalonia's independence standoff: How we got here and what comes nextPuigdemont then led a group of Catalan lawmakers in signing what appeared to be a symbolic declaration of independence. The legal status of the document was unclear.Read MoreRajoy said after a meeting of his cabinet Wednesday that he had formally asked the Catalan government to clarify its actions before deciding how to proceed.In a letter to Puigdemont released later, Rajoy said the Catalan leader had until 10 a.m. local time Monday to confirm whether the Catalan parliament had declared independence. Rajoy warned in the letter that if the answer was yes, and Puigdemont refused to withdraw the declaration by the following Thursday, he could impose direct rule under article 155 of the Spanish constitution.\"The council of ministers has agreed to require formally the government of Catalonia to confirm if they have declared the declaration of independence, in spite of the confusion generated by the suspension,\" Rajoy said after the Cabinet meeting.\"This requirement -- prior to any measures the government may adopt under article 155 of our constitution -- seeks to offer citizens the clarity and security that such an important issue requires.\"He called on the Catalan authorities to \"return to institutional normality and go back to legality.\" Rajoy has previously refused to hold talks unless Puigdemont drops his independence claim.     Puigdemont: Politics, not policeRajoy's challenge will force Puigdemont to clarify what may have been an intentionally ambiguous statement. Asked by CNN why he had not pushed for independence immediately on Tuesday, Puigdemont responded: \"In the first place because of a sense of responsibility. I do not want to declare independence, I want to make it happen.\"JUST WATCHEDThe man who wants to break away from SpainReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe man who wants to break away from Spain 03:00He said he felt obliged to open a window for dialogue in response to international demands -- adding that a formal offer of dialogue like the one he had made to Madrid \"needs a response in days.\"Puigdemont insisted the government in Madrid had no reason to apply article 155 of the constitution to Catalonia and that to do so would be a mistake.He also rejected any suggestion that he should be arrested for his actions, saying he was not a criminal. \"My arrest would be unjustified and a mistake; this is not the moment to send people with whom you have political discrepancies to prison.\"Puigdemont said it was an important time for both sides to enter into dialogue. Catalan President Carles Puigdemont speaks to CNN on Wednesday, October 11 in Barcelona. \"We are at a point where the most important thing that there is no previous condition to sit down and talk, to accept that we have to talk, we need to talk in the right conditions,\" he said. \"Maybe, it could help (us) to talk if two people representing the Spanish government and two people representing the Catalan government just simply agree on one thing, for instance, naming a mediator.\"Puigdemont blamed the current turmoil on the state's response. \"Yesterday I tried to send a message of calmness and to remind people that we are facing a political problem that we need to solve with politics and not with police,\" he said.Hundreds of people were injured in Catalonia on October 1 as Spanish national police sought to prevent the referendum going ahead. Catalan authorities said 90% of voters supported a split from Spain. But they conceded that the turnout was only 43%.Rajoy: 'Worst moment in recent history'Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy speaks at the Spanish Parliament following the Catalonian independence vote on October 11.Addressing the Spanish Parliament in Madrid later Wednesday, Rajoy reiterated that the ball is in Puigdemont's court and described the current crisis as \"one of the worst moments in the recent history of democracy.\"The Prime Minister said the tourism sector in Catalonia had already been badly hit by the unrest, with occupancy down 20% in \"big hotels\" and 40% in tourist apartments.\"There have been more warnings to international travelers after what happened recently than after the terrorist attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils in August,\" he said.Catalan referendum, explained: What's behind the push to break from Spain?Rajoy also rejected the role of third-party mediators in the crisis, saying that while most have good intentions, \"there is no possible mediation between democracy and illegality.\"Spanish Socialist opposition leader Pedro Sanchez echoed Rajoy's call for clarity from the Catalan government, saying neither Catalans nor the rest of the nation should be left in a state of uncertainty.Speaking at his party's headquarters, he said Rajoy had agreed to open a process of constitutional reform in Spain but that this was unconnected to events in Catalonia. \"We consider that the best way to defend the constitution is to reform it,\" he said.CNN's Nic Robertson reported from Barcelona and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.

        "content": "Story highlightsSeveral US citizens have been detained in Turkey on terror chargesMany are accused of having links to President Erdogan's adversary, Fethullah GulenIstanbul, Turkey (CNN)The diplomatic row between Turkey and the United States unfolded rapidly over less than a week -- Turkey arrested a US consular staff member, Washington responded by freezing most of its visa services in the country and Ankara did the same.To add insult to injury, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday said he no longer recognized the authority of the US ambassador.But this latest tit-for-tat between the two uncomfortable NATO allies has been years in the making, as Washington and Ankara remain deadlocked over a list of grievances that have soured relations.And in the political crosshairs are several US citizens -- as well as Turks working for American diplomatic missions -- detained in an ongoing purge that followed a failed military coup last year.Erdogan must stop picking fights with Turkey's friendsThe Turkish government accuses many of them for having links to the Turkish Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who lives in exile in the US and whom Turkey blames for orchestrating the failed coup. Ankara considers Gulen and his followers terrorists, and so has made terror allegations against many of the American detainees.Read MoreUp high on the Turkish government's list of grievances is the US' refusal to extradite Gulen. Another is Washington's continued support for Kurdish factions fighting ISIS in Syria -- Ankara considers them terrorists who threaten Turkey's sovereignty and security. The US supports and arms them, and considers them a reliable force fighting ISIS.One cleric for anotherAmong the US citizens detained is American pastor Andrew Brunson, who was arrested a year ago in Izmir, where he lived and worked at a church.Brunson was told that he was detained for being a \"national security risk\" and was later charged with having links to a movement inspired by Gulen.American pastor Andrew Brunson with his wife, Norine Brunson. Gulen lives in exile in Pennsylvania, and Ankara has repeatedly pressured Washington to extradite him. The US has said that it does not have enough evidence to legally do so.Nearly two weeks ago, Erdogan, who sees Gulen as his nemesis, made it clear in a televised speech that Ankara could swap Brunson for Gulen.\"'Give us the pastor back', they say. Well, you have a pastor as well. Give that one back to us, then we will give him (Brunson) back to you,\" Erdogan said.Fadi Hakura, who manages the Turkey Project at Chatham House in London, said the remarks had \"raised question marks\" in Washington.\"It has created the perception in Washington that Brunson was illegally arrested as a bargaining chip.\"Fethullah Gulen: A rare look at polarizing Turkish exileClyde Forsberg, an American academic, told CNN that he was detained in the town of Karabuk for four days the month after the failed coup.He mused that instead of Brunson \"it could easily have been me.\"Forsberg was fired from his job and arrested after he wrote and posted poems on Facebook about his colleagues who had been detained in the purge. He was charged with aiding and abetting a terrorist organization, he said.\"The interrogations were so absurd. They asked questions like, do I have books? I'm a university professor. What they meant to ask was do I have Gulen books? I worked out that the answers to everything had to be no,\" he said.The Turkish Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.Lives in disarrayAnother American detained is Serkan Golge, a 37-year-old NASA physicist who holds dual Turkish-US citizenship.He was working on a project to send astronauts to Mars, looking at the effects of space radiation on astronauts.Serkan Golge was detained in Turkey just after the failed military coup in 2016. He was on holiday in Turkey when he was arrested, accused of having links to the Gulenist movement.Golge's wife, Kubra Golge, dismissed the allegations as ridiculous and said the 14 months without her husband had been \"the most painful in my life.\"\"My entire body aches but I'm not sick. Or it feels like someone has smashed a hammer through my head and just left our lives in complete disarray,\" she told CNN.\"I hope this all works out. Sometimes I have hope and other times I have none. I cannot see the future.\"The couple have two children and have had to put their home in Houston up for sale, she said. Her husband is now on unpaid leave and the pair have been unable to keep up their payments.Their 7-year-old son is now attending school in Turkey.\"But he has trouble adjusting. He keeps dreaming of going back to the US.\"Kurdish issuesBut Gulen is not the only contentious issue. Turkey has also feuded with the US over its support for Kurdish fighters in Syria.The US has backed an alliance of rebel fighters -- the Syrian Democratic Forces -- in its effort to eradicate ISIS from the country. The problem is that the backbone of the alliance is the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), a Syrian offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).Turkey and the US both consider the PKK a terrorist organization, but they differ on their stance when it comes to the YPG.The US sees the Kurdish fighters in Syria as the most crucial and reliable of local forces in Syria, while Turkey is concerned that the Kurds could gain territory in Syria on Turkey's southern border.One person who has been detained over links to the PKK is Hamza Ulucay, who worked for more than three decades in the US mission in Adana.He is not a US citizen, but he was the first of two Turkish nationals working for the US mission to Turkey who have been arrested this year. The second, whom state media named as Metin Topuz, was detained in September and formally arrested last week for having alleged links to Gulen as well as for espionage. It was his arrest that kicked off the visa row. A third consular staff member is now being sought by prosecutors, who have already detained and charged his wife and adult child.",

        "content": "(CNN)He's either a freedom fighter, the defender of the Catalan voice or the disloyal radical risking it all to break Spain apart. It depends on how you view the crisis that's spilled onto the streets of Barcelona as Catalonia pushes to break away from Madrid. Those who know him best believe one thing is certain about Catalan President Carles Puigdemont -- he's always believed in independence. \"Carles Puigdemont has independence at his core,\" said Jami Matamala, one of Puigdemont's closest friends. \"This is not something he's improvised. It's something he knows very well. It's a part of who he is.\" Carles Puigdemont (L) and friend Jami Matamala pictured in 2016.\nMatamala and his wife were godparents at Puigdemont's wedding, a Catholic tradition. They're also close to the Puigdemonts' two children.\"He's a person who has always had strong convictions,\" said Matamala. Read MoreAt 54 years old, Puigdemont's convictions reflect the first Catalan generation to emerge out of the shadow of dictatorship. Francisco Franco ruled over Spain from 1939 until he died in 1975. Franco banned the Catalan language and cracked down on Catalan traditions and culture. His death ushered in a new era of democracy and Spain split into 17 autonomous regions, including Catalonia. But Matamala said the scars of dictatorship remain; for him the police crackdown on last Sunday's referendum serves as a brutal reminder of the past. \"We thought Franquismo was over,\" said Matamala. \"That we were living a full democracy. But what happened these days shows us that democracy in this country is not reliable.\" Catalan is a 'feeling'Puigdemont grew up in Amer, a sleepy village not far from the town of Girona. It was founded in 949 AD during what nationalists maintain was one of the only periods Catalonia was independent. The Catalans who oppose a split from SpainCenturies later, the area remains fiercely pro-independence, with the highest referendum turnout. Ninety percent voted to leave. Multicolored \"Si\" flags still hang from the balconies in a show of Catalan pride. The village is tiny; so tiny we bumped into Puigdemont's 28-year-old cousin in the main square. Joan Molins Puigdemont explained what it means to be Catalan. \"It's a feeling\" he said. \"It's really hard to express in words. We're different from Spanish people. We respect them but we have a lot of traditions, a lot of culture, and that's why we feel so proud.\" Carles Puigdemont is a reflection of that pride, he said.  At the back of the main square is the Puigdemont family bakery, which is known for its delicious sweets and pastries. The Puigdemonts still live upstairs. They've declined all media requests, but inside the shop is a sign of their support. Near the baked goods and magazines is a photo from last Sunday's crackdown: An older woman, hands up, faces down the national police.As a kid, Puigdemont was loyal, cosmopolitan, and fiercely intelligent, according to friends. He had a keen interest in the outside world. Friends also describe growing up frustrated with how the Spanish government treated Catalan officials. The call to independence was always there. Puigdemont, front left, sits with students in Geneva during an international conference in 1982.An old photo taken in 1982 shows 20-year-old Puigdemont and a group of exchange students in Geneva during an international conference. According to his friend Vador Clar\u00e0, Piugdemont decided to walk around the city carrying the separatist 'estelada' flag that a tailor from his hometown had sewn. Many asked him where he was from; some confused the flag with the Cuban flag. 'A very interesting character'When he was 18, Puigdemont left Amer for the nearby town of Girona. He became a journalist and businessman but soon entered local politics. According to friends he was not a natural politician but has evolved rapidly. He became the town's mayor in 2011 and the Catalan president in 2016.  Journalist Antoni Puigverd said he doesn't share Puigdemont's views on independence. Nonetheless they're longtime friends.JUST WATCHEDHow Catalonia's independence crisis unfoldedReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHow Catalonia's independence crisis unfolded 02:24Puidgemont never had \"personal ambition\" for politics, said Puigverd. He became the politician he is today through circumstance, and lacks a personal thirst for power.\"This shows us a very interesting character,\" Puigverd said. \"Because this is a character with huge national Catalan ambition but without personal ambition. It is very strange to find a character like this ... He's a very surprising candidate for the Spanish government because they cannot attack his career, because he already knows he's sacrificing his career.\" Matamala takes it a step further. He said Puigdemont is not only willing to sacrifice his own career for the cause, but also his personal freedom. He knows he could be arrested. \"We've talked about this,\" said Matamala. \"He is very conscious it is possible. Therefore, he also has a plan in case it happens. Carles Puigdemont always has things planned and it's difficult for him to leave loose ends.\"  Catalan referendum, explained: What's behind the push to break from Spain?According to friends, Puigdemont's plan does not include violence nor does he have the stomach to see Catalonia's economy destroyed. They insist the violent crackdown on referendum voters was a shock. Puigdemont could declare independence on Tuesday. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has said he could invoke emergency powers over Catalonia in response. Many fear more violence. Although Puigdemont has some far-left extremists in his inner circle, Puigverd believes he will work to deescalate the situation, even if it means backing off independence -- for now. \"Puigdemont won't take people to the butcher,\" said Puigverd. \"The Spanish Government knows this, and this is why they are stretching the situation to the max ... It's an open wound and we need to get the inflammation down. And I know Puigdemont will try to treat the wound with anti-inflammatories.\"There's going to be a transition period where things calm down \"after the situation reaches the limit,\" he added.

But the session, due to begin at 12 p.m. ET (6p.m. local time) was delayed amid reports of international mediation to end the crisis.Puigdemont requested the delay \"given the contacts for an international mediation,\" his spokesman Joan Maria Pique told CNN. He did not immediately provide additional details on the mediation.The anti-independence Ciutadans party and the Catalan branch of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's  Popular Party (PPC) had also requested a suspension of Tuesday' rsession, according to a document seen by CNN.Puigdemont was under intense pressure to back down from plans to declare independence from Spain following a disputed referendum.Read MoreThe Parc de la Ciutadella, which houses the Catalan parliament building, was sealed off to the public for safety reasons, with the Catalan police Mossos guarding the entrances and exits. National police and the Guardia Civil kept a low profile, according to CNN reporters. Officers of Catalonia's regional police force stand guard outside the Parliament of Catalonia.European Council President Donald Tusk urged Puigdemont to back down. \"The force of arguments is always better than the argument of force,\" he said in Brussels.\"Today I ask you to respect in your attentions the constitutional order and not announce a decision that would make such a dialogue impossible,\" he said. \"Diversity should not lead to conflict whose consequences would be bad for Catalonia, Spain and the whole of Europe.\"Mayor of Barcelona Ada Colau, an influential figure who has been critical of both sides, called for de-escalation. She urged Puigdemont not to make a unilateral declaration of independence, and also called on the government of Prime Minister Rajoy not to impose direct rule from Madrid. \"Now is the time for dialogue,\" she said in address from in Barcelona.Barcelona mayor Ada Colau delivers a speech at the City Council in Barcelona.\nColau said Spain was experiencing its \"worst institutional crisis since democracy began\" and said Spain's political elected representatives should \"find a solution that is inclusive and up to standards we have been living.\"Neighboring France said Monday it would not recognize an independent Catalonia -- and independence would result in automatic expulsion from the European Union. Political uncertaintyHowever thousands of supporters of independence are expected to show up at the parliament in Barcelona to show support for the plan, and to call on Puigdemont to honor his commitments to the separatist movement. The political uncertainty began with a divisive and controversial referendum on October 1 that found a majority of Catalan voters in favor of independence for the wealthy, northeastern region of Spain. Madrid declared the referendum illegal and Spanish police tried to shut the vote down by firing rubber bullets and pulling voters from polling booths in scenes that shocked many across Europe. JUST WATCHEDCatalonia: We want to talk, 'nobody' listeningReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCatalonia: We want to talk, 'nobody' listening 08:36Catalonia's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Raul Romeva Rueda, told CNN's Nima Elbagir that the Catalan side has long wanted to negotiate a fair bargain with the Spanish state. \"What we have always demanded is a political dialogue. The opportunity to (practice) democracy, to allow everybody to express themselves ... We want to talk, we need to negotiate. The problem is nobody's listening from the Spanish state side.\" He said that the Catalan government has invited international mediation and called for dialogue. \"We say, 'we are ready, we want to go to the negotiating table. We are ready to start talks' ... If (the central government has) an offer to make we are very much keen to listen to them.\" PM: 'Spain will not be divided' Prime Minister Rajoy is determined to prevent a breakaway by the northeastern province in the wake of the October 1 vote. \"Spain will not be divided, and the national unity will be preserved. To this end we will employ all the means we have within the law. It is up to the government to make decisions, and to do so at the right moment,\" Rajoy said in an interview with German newspaper Die Welt on Monday.Catalan authorities said 90% of voters chose independence from Madrid, but the result was not as decisive as it appeared -- turnout was only 43%.JUST WATCHEDCatalan leaders threaten independenceReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCatalan leaders threaten independence 01:56What's at stake?The stakes are high for both Spain and Europe if Catalonia chooses to break away.Catalonia accounts for nearly a fifth of Spain's economy, and leads all regions in producing 25% of the country's exports, CNNMoney reports. It contributes much more in taxes (21% of the country's total) than it gets back from the central government.The prospect of an independent Catalonia has already prompted two major banks and some other businesses to move their registered headquarters to other parts of Spain.There is more at stake for Madrid than losing wealth. The country has 17 regions with varying degrees of autonomy, and losing one may inspire others to begin, or revive, separatist movements.But there are many other unanswered questions, including continued membership in the European Union.If forced to apply independently for EU membership, Catalonia would have to convince all of the bloc's current members, including Spain, to agree.And if Catalonia became an independent state, it would not automatically be a World Trade Organization member, so would likely face stiff trade barriers that would hurt its economy.JUST WATCHEDHow Catalonia's independence crisis unfoldedReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHow Catalonia's independence crisis unfolded 02:24Speaking on French TV Monday, Nathalie Loiseau, France's minister of European affairs, said the French government would not recognize an independent Catalonia.\"If independence were to be recognized -- which is not something that's being discussed -- the most immediate consequence would be that (Catalonia) automatically left the European Union,\" said  Loiseau.Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya S\u00e1enz de Santamar\u00eda said in an interview on Spanish radio that the government would invoke powers to take control of the regional government if Catalonia went ahead and declared independence.Journalist Elena Gyldenkerne and CNN's Vasco Cotovio contributed to this report from Barcelona.",

Protesters hold a banner that reads \"Catalonia is Spain\" at the pro-unity rally in Barcelona on Sunday. The Catalan leaders claimed that 90% of voters were in favor of seceding from Spain. Those numbers are unlikely to be representative of true public opinion, as supporters of remaining in Spain may have considered voting illegal and abstained.A week of protests have nonetheless shown a bitter division. Massive crowds have taken to the streets to rally for independence since the vote a week ago. But there have also been large crowds against separation, including in Madrid, as well as protests calling for dialogue.Read MoreA car is adorned with Spanish and Catalan flags reading \"I am Spanish and Catalan\" and \"I am Catalan and Spanish.\"The march was organized by the Societat Civil Catalana, which is supported by political parties in Madrid and which called on people from all over the country to attend the march. It wasn't clear how many people might have come in from other cities. CNN spoke to several  protesters, all of whom were Catalan. In a sea of red-and-yellow Spanish and Catalan flags, protesters sent a clear message, shouting: \"Catalonia is Spain.\"Jose Francisco Sanchez, 38, said that the October 1 independence referendum was illegal. Jose Francisco Sanchez, 38, said that he rejected the vote and didn't cast a ballot himself because he saw the referendum as illegal.\"I am not worried because I believe in the laws of Spain and the laws of Europe.

Something like pop culture which they are curious about or some fun news that occurs in the world society would be one way to do it.\"The 43-year old publishes his paper from New Malden, a 30-minute train ride from central London, which is home to an estimated 10,000 ethnic Koreans.Among them are about 700 North Koreans, the largest such community in Europe. Read MoreThe South Korean embassy was once based in New Malden, and it's where tech company Samsung first established its European headquarters. Both have since left, but the Korean diaspora still uses it as a base to ease the transition to the West and remain close to members of their community.Defectors work in kitchensDozens of Korean restaurants line New Malden's streets, where some North Korean defectors work in the kitchens preparing classic dishes from home -- kimchi and barbecue meat.The latest volley of threats between United States and North Korea has some worried in this community, but they cannot check on their families still inside the country. Communication with the outside world is extremely difficult in North Korea, and calls home carry great risk.One defector, activist Jihyun Park told CNN that she once tried to contact her brother-in-law in North Korea. A couple of years ago, she paid a smuggler in China 1,000 pounds ($1,300) to get a prepaid cellphone to his home in North Korea. The phone call cost her brother-in-law much more.

After moving to the UK she turned to Christianity and plays the Janggu, a traditional Korean drum, in her local church.Hyunjoo Kim dances at a New Malden restaurant.Kim struggles with life in the UK and still can't speak English, but with its dozens of Korean establishments, New Malden offers a safe haven.After a traditional meal of kimchi pancakes and fish stew, the music teacher performs a dance to a Korean song called \"By the Love of My Lord.\"Its Christian lyrics would have sent her to prison or worse in North Korea, where there is only one higher power: the country's leader, Kim Jong Un.But here, she is free to sway and twirl as the restaurant staff nod along to the music.JUST WATCHEDNorth Korean defector reveals smuggling operationReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNorth Korean defector reveals smuggling operation 02:35Sending news homeJoo Il Kim told CNN he too was once unequivocally loyal to the North Korean regime. \"When I was in North Korea, I was a model student,\" Kim said, \"From the time I was in school, I trusted the text books 100% and trusted the North Korean government's revolution. Simply put, I grew up trusting the North Korean regime completely.\"\n\n\n\n\nHe joined the army and was a loyal soldier of the ruling dynasty that began with founder Kim Il Sung, but that changed after he saw his nephew starve to death before his eyes. He defected, brazenly crossing the border into China in 2007 while still wearing his military uniform. CNN was unable to independently verify the details of Kim's or Park's story.Like many in New Malden, Kim does not know if his family in North Korea is dead or alive. He simply tries not to let these thoughts enter his mind.\"I believe there must have been a punishment. Perhaps, punishment that I cannot even imagine,\" Kim said.North Korean defectors say they have seen families of other defectors punished in order to deter their countrymen from leaving. Pyongyang also operates under a system in which families can be collectively punished for the crimes of an individual.\"I try not think about it now, because if there is emotion involving your family, you cannot perform this job. I would be an emotional hostage of the North Korean regime, I do not seek the ways to find my family until the day I go back to North Korea,\" he added.Joo Il Kim shows CNN a copy of Free NK.The only way he and the hundreds living just outside London can return is if the North Korean regime changes, and that's exactly what Kim is trying to do with his newspaper.\"We are putting helium in the balloon and attaching the newspaper on the side, and because they shoot at it, we only do it at night time,\" Kim said, as he showed a video of him sending copies of Free NK by hot air balloon across the South Korean border.The father of two is constantly trying to find creative ways to send news home. He believes the only solution to the crisis is to educate North Korean citizens.\"If I am the only one enjoying the wealth and comfort here just by myself, I will feel guilty towards the people left behind in North Korea,\" he said. \"As long as I am here in a free land, I will never starve to death even if I don't do anything.

Of course it hurts, and we're all disappointed,\" he added.\"But now we need to get back, get some rest and then go flat-out for the last four races and see what happens.\"READ: How crashing out helps F1 drivers winFerrari last won the drivers' title in 2007 -- Kimi Raikkonen beat Hamilton by a single point -- and a decade on the early signs in the 2017 season had been so promising for the Italian team.Class from Sebastian Vettel#JapaneseGP \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5 #F1 pic.twitter.com/1u3eaJbboF\u2014 Formula 1 (@F1) October 9, 2017 Hamilton trailed Vettel by 14 points heading into the summer break after the Hungarian Grand Prix, but even \"flat-out\" probably won't be enough to salvage a championship that just five weeks ago was Vettel's to lose.A combination of Ferrari's unreliability and a resurgent Lewis Hamilton has turned Vettel from favorite to a rank outsider to win a fifth world title.Since returning from F1's summer break Hamilton has picked up 118 points (four wins and one second place) while Vettel has managed a paltry 45. If Hamilton wins the US Grand Prix (on October 22) and Vettel finishes lower than fifth the championship will be over and the waiting for Ferrari will go on.\"It's kind of unbelievable... we are where we are,\" Hamilton said, when asked about the title race and Ferrari's spluttering challenge.\"I was excited to have a good race with Sebastian here as I was in the last race but obviously he's been incredibly unfortunate. Visit CNN.com/motorsport for more F1 news and features\"There's still a long  way to go -- 100 points is a lot of points. Anything can happen in life, so I've just go to keep my head down and hopefully continue to perform like this.\"For Ferrari and Vettel it will be a question of keeping their heads up.",

        "content": "Mer, Torres Strait  (CNN)Australian NBA star Patty Mills could barely walk when he returned after midnight to his spartan lodging on the remote South Pacific island of Mer, his ancestral home in the middle of the Coral Sea.The village Elders gave him as thorough a workout as anything meted out by his trainers at the San Antonio Spurs, who re-signed him as their point guard in August for a reported $50 million ($65 million Australian).Mills is second only to Joe Ingles as the highest paid Australian in the NBA, ending last season shooting 41% from 3-point range, 11th in the entire league.\"My trainer was worried about all the days of training I've been missing coming up here, but when he saw me doing my dance practice and the workout my legs were getting he said I'll be fine,\" Mills said.       Mer, also known as Murray Island, is a tiny dot of land, less than five square kilometers, that sits in the Torres Strait between Australia's Cape York Peninsula and Papua New Guinea.Read MoreFewer than 600 people live there, according to the latest census, and in August the entire island came out to welcome home one of their most famous sons.Mills is a Torres Strait Islander from his father's side and an Australian Aboriginal from his mother's.As one of the most successful ever Indigenous Australian sportsman, Mills is a role model for many young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.And in the Torres Strait, where he spent part of his childhood, he's considered nothing short of a hero.     Career on the courtPatrick Sammy Mills is the second Indigenous Australian to play the NBA after his cousin Nathan Jawai. They come from a strong sporting pedigree.Their uncle Danny Morseu was the first Indigenous player to represent Australia in basketball, at the 1980 and 1984 Olympics.Born August 11, 1988, Mills grew up in Australia's capital Canberra but spent time on Thursday Island, the administrative hub of the Torres Strait, and the home of his father Benny Mills.Now 29, the younger Mills was first exposed to basketball when he was four years old, training with the Shadows, an Indigenous Australian team established by his parents who worked on government projects for Indigenous people.By 16, he had accepted a basketball scholarship with the Australian Institute of Sport and by 18 had taken up a college scholarship at Saint Mary's College of California.Mills made his NBA debut in 2008 at the age of 20 after signing with the Portland Trail Blazers.He has been point guard for San Antonio Spurs since 2012 and has represented Australia playing for the Boomers in the 2008, 2012 and 2016 Olympics.Mills celebrates a basket during the Men's Basketball Bronze medal game between Australia and Spain at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games, August 21.\"It's been a very hard and long journey to get to this stage, but I want everyone to know that no matter what basketball jersey I put on, San Antonio, Australian Boomers, I represent everyone,\" Mills said in a speech to the Mer community in August, before performing his traditional island dance.\"What motivates me is you, so when I shine I hope you feel it too because you all shine too.\" Remote South Pacific island Traveling to Mer requires a 90-minute plane flight north of Cairns over the wilderness of Cape York, to Horn Island in the Torres Strait, then another 50-minute flight in a smaller plane east over the tip of the Great Barrier Reef.Mer is one of three islands which are the remnants of an extinct volcano, but the island's traditional owners, the Meriam Mer people, believe Mer was formed by a boy named Gelam.According to the legend, Gelam and his mother Usar were left alone on Moa Island in the central islands of Torres Strait where they were terrorized by an evil monster called Dhogai. Gelam decides to leave Moa and his mother by building a dugong or manatee from a wattle tree and travels east to Mer Island where the dugong becomes a large hill in the shape of the animal.Australian NBA star Patty Mills looks out of the plane as he heads to his ancestral home of Mer off the northern coast of Australia.Looking out from the plane window on the approach toward Mer, Mills points out the ridge line of the island and how it ties into the tale.\"See, that is the body of the dugong, facing back towards the Torres Strait from where he came,\" he said over the wail of the small plane's engines.The island of Mer, also known as Murray Island, in the Torres Strait between Australia and Papua New Guinea.On arrival, visitors to Mer pass through a metal archway fashioned like the jaws of \"Beizam,\" the tiger shark, an important totem animal.It's not open to everyone; permission to visit the island must be granted by the traditional owners of this all Indigenous Islander community.\"The tarmac is under the law, Australian law, but as soon as you step through the shark's mouth and on to Meriam Mir land, you are under the lore, Meriam Mir lore,\" says traditional owner Doug Passi on the airport's landing strip.Mer is revered throughout the Torres Strait for its strong cultural heritage but also as the \"cradle of Native Title\" after the successful Mabo High Court case in 1992, which recognized the land rights of Australia's Indigenous people.The case was by championed by Mer islander, Mills' great uncle Eddie Koiki Mabo, whose grave on the island is now a sacred site, and where islanders pay their respects.Patty Mills and his partner Alyssa Levesque visit Eddie Mabo's grave on Mer.Reconnecting with cultureAll scheduled engagements were canceled soon after Mills' arrival on Mer as his uncles stole him away for three hours of dance training.After a traditional feast of lobster, clam meat, turtle, pickled fish and yams cooked in coconut milk, Mills had to perform the sacred Beizam shark dance, which is rarely seen outside Mer, in front of the Elders and the community.The dance starts with a slow solemn drumbeat, played by Elders on the traditional wooden warup drum. The three dancers, Mills in the middle, march in time to the center of the clearing, holding their shark mouth headdresses in front of them. The headdresses are sacred emblems of the Malo cult, the Meriam Mir belief system that pre-dates the arrival of European settlers in the 18th century.The chorus of wailing crescendos as the dancers put on their headdresses, biting down on a brace with their teeth, making their mouths become that of the shark.They then spring about in unison, lightly on their toes, their arms out stretched as the turn left and right in movements that mimic the mighty Beizam hunting in the ocean.Australian NBA star Patty Mills wears a shark headdress on his ancestral island of Mer off Far North Queensland.The dance was once performed by the Zogo Le, the powerful sorcerer of the village. Today, it's an important rite of passage for Meriam Mir men. Mills had not performed it for more than a decade.After dance training, Mills rested his aching legs in a deckchair in the common room of the Island Council lodge as he listened to his father, Benny, explain the importance of Meriam Mir culture.\"When you see Islander dancing it's important to understand it's cultural significance, not only to Meriam Mir people but all people of Australia.\"\"This is not like doing the 'bus stop', it's about a deeper level of understanding. It's not just part of Meriam culture but part of Australian culture and something all Australians should have an understanding about -- its part of all of us, it's part of not just being an Islander, but being an Australian.\"Islander dancing is an integral part of the local Indigenous culture. Dances are performed at every social event from funerals to weddings. Everyone on the islands is taught the moves and their meaning, whether they're from there or not.        Mills, the role modelMills is well aware of the responsibility that comes with being a role model to young Indigenous Australians.He's recently published \"Game Day!\" -- a series of children's books about a young basketball player who overcomes challenges on and off the court.Mills' visit to Mer was part of his new role as an official ambassador for the 2018 Commonwealth Games to be held on the Gold Coast, Queensland, next April.Basketball is on the program for the first time since 2006, but Mills won't be playing due to commitments with the NBA.\"I've always been an ambassador for Australians, non-Indigenous Australians and Indigenous Australians... I let people know about who I am and that I'm not just a basketballer, I'm a person who comes from a very rich heritage.\"Based on the latest census, almost 650,000 people identified as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in Australia, about 2.8% of the population of 24 million people.Typically, fewer Indigenous children finish school than non-Indigenous people, they have poorer health and earn less, despite successive governments' attempts to address historic failures and prejudice in the system.Inspiring Indigenous children that they can achieve great things despite adversity is a message that Mills wants to share.  In 2014, after the San Antonio Spurs won the NBA Finals, he brought the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy, which he nicknamed \"Bala Lazza,\" to the Torres Strait.The name itself represents a blend of cultures. In Meriam Mir, \"Bala\" means brother, and \"Lazza\" is Australian slang for Larry. Mills and his teammate, fellow Queenslander, Aron Baynes carried the solid sterling silver and gold-plated trophy through the streets of Thursday Island.The San Antonio Spurs celebrate with the Larry O'Brien NBA Championship Trophy after defeating the Miami Heat 107-84 in Game 5 of the NBA Finals to win the NBA Finals Championship 2014.The whole community got the chance to hold it and Patty, his father Benny and the Elders danced around trophy on the lawn into the night.That sense of shared achievement is something Mills has brought all the way from the Torres Strait to Texas.\"He's just a special competitor, team player,\" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said at a press conference in May.\"He's a big part of the spirit of our team. Whether he starts or comes off the bench, he's the same. Just a beautiful human being that energizes a whole group, and somebody that the group loves to be around. That's who he is.\"For Mills, his culture is a source of celebration -- and strength.He credits his ancestral ties with giving him the grounding to push for the top in the NBA, and for whatever comes next, off the court. \"I have been instilled with culture from such a young age that I know who I am, and I know once sporting is out of the picture, I will have this to come back to and continue the customs and traditions that I've been taught,\" Mills said.\"That's why it's special to come back here and continue that. Now I've just refueled the culture tank for another year so I will be able to go and do what I do.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)German Chancellor Angela Merkel has agreed to aim for a limit on Germany's refugee intake, marking a significant retreat from her previous rejection of a cap.  Merkel made the announcement Monday in a joint news conference with Horst Seehofer, leader of the Christian Social Union -- the more conservative sister party to Merkel's Christian Democratic Union -- after discussions in which the two parties sought compromises on a number of issues following poor results in the federal elections two weeks ago.Through Germany's open door: What life is really like for refugees The parties have agreed to try and limit the number of refugees arriving in Germany each year to 200,000 -- a policy that Seehofer has repeatedly demanded and Merkel had consistently rejected.\"On the issue of an upper limit, my position is clear,\" Merkel said in July. \"I won't accept one.\"Nearly three months later, that position has changed. \"I'm pleased about the compromise we've found,\" she said Monday, describing the deal as a \"very, very good basis\" for the two parties to enter coalition talks next week.Read More2015 'cannot be repeated'The new policy is not described as an upper limit (\"Obergrenze\") and comes with several caveats, but still marks a concession by Merkel to the more conservative forces in her sister party.\"We will continue our efforts to reduce, sustainably and permanently, the number of people who flee to Germany and Europe, so that a situation like that of 2015 will not and cannot be repeated,\" reads a joint CSU/CDU position paper published Monday. \"We guarantee that.\"More than a million refugees entered the country in 2015 as a result of Merkel's so-called open-door migration policy, sparking a heated national debate about immigration and integration.Seehofer has strongly criticized Merkel for allowing over a million refugees into Germany in 2015.The 200,000 figure refers to controlled admissions, such as refugees resettled as part of EU programs or under the deal struck between the bloc and Turkey in 2016.Reducing the number of asylum seekers who arrive outside the framework of these programs can be achieved by fighting traffickers, protecting the EU's borders and striking deals with countries of origin and transit, according to the document. Merkel and Seehofer made clear Monday that the figure itself is flexible -- the Bundestag can decide to raise or lower it in extreme circumstances -- and the fundamental right to seek asylum is guaranteed: People will not be turned away at the borders after the limit is reached.'Regressive' policiesWe can say goodbye to a stable GermanyBut Karl Kopp, director for European affairs at Pro Asyl, a German charity that advocates for refugees, told CNN that any kind of limit is \"not compatible with international law\" and \"totally unacceptable.\"He's also concerned that a further proposal to house all asylum seekers in \"decision and repatriation centers\" while their claims are assessed will be detrimental for the integration process and encourage hostility toward refugees. Kopp sees these \"regressive\" announcements as a direct response to the success of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) in last month's election. The party, which campaigned on an anti-Islam, anti-immigration platform, won 12.6% of the vote and is now the third largest party in Parliament. Alice Weidel and Alexander Gauland, co-lead candidates of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) celebrate after the announcement of the initial results of the federal election on September 24Across Europe, far-right parties have \"hijacked the agenda,\" Kopp said. Discussions about migration in Germany are now \"inspired by the right wing and the AfD. It's a poisoned debate.\"On the night of the election, Merkel described the AfD's success as a \"big new challenge\" and said she wanted to \"win back AfD voters.\" This new position may be an attempt to do just that. Although Merkel's party won the biggest share of the vote in the country's federal elections two weeks ago -- propelling her to a fourth term in office -- support for her party fell by 8.6 percentage points, with many voters turning to the AfD instead.It is unclear whether this move will encourage those voters to shift their allegiance back to the CDU, but it is likely to cause problems for Merkel during coalition discussions. The Green party is committed to fighting any kind of limit on refugee numbers and reiterated that position Sunday night.Und wo ist da der Unterschied zur #Obergrenze? Zahl ist v\u00f6llig beliebig, also rein ideologisch festgelegt. F\u00fcr uns gilt Grundrecht auf Asyl! https://t.co/J3FapZJ4aD\u2014 Simone Peter (@peter_simone) October 8, 2017\n\nIn a post on Twitter, Simone Peter, co-leader of the party, insisted there was no difference between this agreement and Seehofer's earlier demands for an \"Obergrenze.\"\"And where is the difference with an upper limit?\" Peter wrote. \"Number is totally arbitrary, determined purely ideologically. For us it's the basic right to asylum that matters!\"",

        "content": "Story highlights Barcelona mayor says, \"Escalation will not benefit anyone\"Deep divisions over the issue of Catalan independence (CNN)Spain faces a week of deep political uncertainty as the secessionist leader of Catalonia considers whether to make a unilateral declaration of independence, against the backdrop of a bitter standoff with the central government in Madrid.Catalan President Carles Puigdemont had been expected to make a formal declaration at a specially convened session of the Catalan parliament on Tuesday.But there was intense speculation on Monday about whether Puigdemont would go ahead with such a provocative move -- particularly in the light of a huge rally against independence in Barcelona at the weekend that exposed deep misgivings about his tactics among some sections of Catalan society.Spanish leader Rajoy mulls suspending Catalonia autonomyThe French government said on Monday that it would not recognize an independent Catalonia, and that independence would result in automatic expulsion from the European Union.In an interview with the French TV station CNews, Nathalie Loiseau, France's minister of European affairs, said any declaration of independence would leave Catalonia isolated. \"If independence were to be recognized -- which is not something that's being discussed -- the most immediate consequence would be that (Catalonia) automatically left the European Union,\" she said.Read MoreSpanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said he was determined to prevent a breakaway by the northeastern province, which is the powerhouse of the Spanish economy, in the wake of a banned referendum on October 1.\"Spain will not be divided, and the national unity will be preserved. To this end we will employ all the means we have within the law. It is up to the government to make decisions, and to do so at the right moment,\" Rajoy said in an interview with German newspaper Die Welt on Monday.\"We have listened to many people. I believe we know what Spaniards think, and they should know that the government, too, is clear about what it has to do,\" he said.Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya S\u00e1enz de Santamar\u00eda said in an interview on Spanish radio that the government would invoke powers to take control of the regional government if Catalonia went ahead and declared independence. Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau, however, urged the government to refrain from invoking the never-before-used Article 155, which allows Madrid to take over autonomous regions. \"Escalation will not benefit anyone,\" she said, urging both sides to begin dialogue with each other and for Rajoy to \"be responsible and listen to the people,\" and to roll back the police force that was dispatched to the region ahead of the vote. Colau said Spain was amid its \"worst institutional crisis since democracy began\" and said Spain's political representatives should \"find a solution that is inclusive and up to standards we have been living.\"What's at stake?The stakes are high for both Spain and Europe if Catalonia chooses to break away. Catalonia accounts for nearly a fifth of Spain's economy, and leads all regions in producing 25% of the country's exports, CNNMoney reports. It contributes much more in taxes (21% of the country's total) than it gets back from the central government.The prospect of an independent Catalonia has already prompted two major banks and some other businesses to move their registered headquarters to other parts of Spain.The Catalans who oppose a split from SpainThere is more at stake for Madrid than losing wealth. The country has 17 regions with varying degrees of autonomy, and losing one may inspire others to begin, or revive, separatist movements.But there are many other unanswered questions, including continued membership in the European Union. If forced to apply independently for EU membership, Catalonia would have to convince all of the bloc's current members, including Spain, to agree.And if Catalonia became an independent state, it would not automatically be a World Trade Organization member, so would likely face stiff trade barriers that would hurt its economy.Protests on both sidesBetween 250,000 and 400,000 anti-independence Catalans, and supporters from the rest of Spain, marched through the streets of Barcelona on Sunday to protest any moves for a breakaway state, following a divisive and controversial referendum on October 1 that found a majority of Catalan voters in favor of independence. But the result was not as decisive as it appeared  -- turnout was only 43%.Puigdemont rescheduled a session of the Catalan Parliament for Tuesday after Spain's Constitutional Court suspended Monday's session.Members of Puigdemont's Popular Unity Candidacy party had threatened to meet in Parliament on Monday anyway, in an act of defiance, but it is unclear if they will. A Catalan Parliament spokesperson told CNN that a new\u00a0session had been called for Tuesday at 6 p.m. (12:00 p.m. ET), in which Puigdemont is expected to update members on the \"current political situation.\"The address could be the moment when Catalonia's leader declares that the region will break away. PROFILE: Catalan president has 'independence at his core'Protesters wave Spanish, Catalan and EU flags in a march for unity on Sunday in Barcelona.\"Many people believe -- and he seems to be moving in that direction -- that he will use this opportunity to declare, or to announce the results of the referendum which, as far as he was concerned, were overwhelmingly in favor of independence,\" Dominic Thomas, chair of the department of French and francophone studies at the University of California Los Angeles, told CNN. Whatever happens this week, it's clear that there are deep divisions over the issue, not only between Madrid and Barcelona, but within Catalonia as well. Catalan Parliament to meet TuesdayIn an indication of the deep divisions the referendum has caused, those who marched in Barcelona on Sunday in support of remaining part of Spain argued there was no reason they couldn't be both Catalan and Spanish.But protesters have also marched in favor of independence since the October 1 vote, claiming that the Catalans have a distinct culture from the rest of Spain and that they contribute more to the economy than the other regions. A woman takes part in the \"Let's Talk\" protest in Barcelona to call for dialogue on Saturday.Thomas says that the \"powerful\" show of support for unity means that a declaration of independence may not be well received.\"Many people stayed home and didn't vote (Sunday) so the whole question of the mandate that he would have in speaking before that Parliament and declaring independence would be challenged. \"The turnout in Barcelona and across Spain to talk about Spain and unity and to express the voice of those who would not want this referendum to go ahead was also overwhelmingly powerful.\" 'No turning back'Spanish National Police clash with pro-independence supporters in Barcelona on October 1.Divisions between Catalan leaders and the central government took a particularly brutal form on the day of the vote, when thousands of Spanish police went to Catalonia to try to shut the referendum down and clashed with protesters and voters.Catalan independence supporters see brighter future aloneImages of police firing rubber bullets, restraining elderly people and pulling voters from polling booths by the hair have shocked people around the world. Hundreds were injured.Despite the outrage, Rajoy and Spanish King Felipe VI defended the police and doubled down on their stance to take whatever measures necessary to keep Catalonia from seceding.Rajoy was forced to apologize on Friday, but many in Catalan say the crackdown has only fueled their desire for independence. \"I didn't feel that repressed until what happened on October 1,\" said 25-year-old student Mireya Jimenez. \"I think that whatever they do, they have made us angry, and I think we have seen that a ... part of Spain doesn't like us -- the king doesn't like us either and so I think that, also because of how they've treated us just now, there is no turning back.\"Journalist Elena Gyldenkerne and CNN's Vasco Cotovio contributed to this report from Barcelona.",

Catalan leaders say the people voted overwhelmingly to split, but Madrid has declared the vote illegal.Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is facing one of the most difficult political crises of his leadership.Catalonia, of which Barcelona is the capital, is Spain's wealthiest region and has its own language and distinct culture. It has had a strong independence movement for decades and has already won sweeping powers to govern itself as an autonomous region within Spain.\"We are going to stop independence from happening. On that, I can tell you with absolute frankness, that it will not happen. It is evident that we will take whatever decision that we are permitted to by law, in view of how things are unfolding,\" Rajoy told the El Pais newspaper in an interview.  Asked if this would include using Article 155 of the Constitution, the legal mechanism needed to suspend Catalonia's autonomy, Rajoy said: \"I am not absolutely ruling out anything that the law allows. I would like to do it at the right time ... that it is more important at the moment. Read More\"The ideal scenario would be that there were no need for drastic solutions, but for that there would need to be rectifications.\"Catalan referendum, explained: What's behind the push to break from Spain?He added: \"I want to say something with absolute clarity -- while the threat of independence is in the political landscape, it will be very difficult for the government to not take these decisions.\"Rajoy also called on \"moderate\" Catalans to \"come back\" and move away from \"extremists, radicals\" as well as the Popular Unity Candidacy party (CUP) spearheading the movement. It is the first time he has reached out to the Catalan people since the referendum.Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont has threatened to declare independence early next week, and hundreds of thousands of Catalan protesters marched in favor of splitting from Spain this week. A large crowd with Spanish flags, however, began gathering in central Barcelona on Sunday for a pro-unity march.A woman takes part in a pro-unity march in Barcelona on Sunday with a heart bearing the flags of Catalonia, Spain and the European Union.Rajoy also slammed the independence bid as part of a current wave of populism sweeping across Europe, pointing to the rise of far-right parties in France, Germany and the UK. \"Another form of populism, without doubt, is this nationalist populism that we are experiencing, which violates the fundamental principles of the European Union, goes against the rule of law, against law enforcement, and so it is a problem also from Europe.\"And that's why Europeans have stuck up for us and all the governments have supported the Spanish constitution and the upholding of the law.\"The past week in Catalonia has been nothing short of chaotic. Madrid responded to the vote with force, sending thousands of police to the region to shut down the vote.Images of police restraining elderly women and pulling voters out of polling booths by the hair have caused outrage around the world and appear to have fueled anti-Madrid sentiment in Catalonia itself.",

But there are also many Catalans who oppose separatism.Some pro-independence Catalans spoke to CNN in Barcelona on Friday about why they favor going it alone.'Tired of subsidizing'Henrique Aparici wants greater fiscal autonomy for Catalonia.Read MoreRetired industrial engineer Henrique Aparici, 74, said Catalonia -- a wealthy region -- was \"tired of subsidizing practically the rest of Spain\" while receiving no help from Madrid.\"Both sides are very angry. They don't want to talk, particularly Madrid does not want to talk. Here they are always with their doors open for dialogue, but I think this will end badly,\" he said.JUST WATCHEDWhy these Catalans are against independenceReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhy these Catalans are against independence 01:19Unless there is a U-turn, he said, the Spanish state \"will annul the autonomy, more repression, more police forces and we will have a military intervention.\" Aparici said the motivation for Catalonia's separatists has always been gaining greater fiscal autonomy.\"We're subsidizing Andalucia, we're subsidizing Extremadura, we're subsidizing, subsidizing, subsidizing ... and it comes a time where we don't feel like subsidizing any more. So the only thing that could happen here is that, by force, they make us carry on subsidizing,\" he said.\"This is what we wanted with the referendum, to know if we were the majority or not.\"'They have made us angry'Mireya Jimenez says Madrid's handling of the October 1 referendum has made Catalans angry.Mireya Jimenez, 25, a journalism student, said the way the October 1 referendum was handled has hardened people's views in favor of independence. Hundreds of people were injured last weekend as police sent from Madrid tried to prevent the referendum going ahead.\"I didn't feel that repressed until what happened on October 1,\" she said. \"I think a couple of years ago there were more people who didn't want it (independence), but after all that has happened, I think there are more people who want it.\"I don't think there is turning around. I think that whatever they do, they have made us angry, and I think we have seen that a ... part of Spain doesn't like us, the King doesn't like us either and so I think that, also because of how they've treated us just now, there is no turning back.\"Jimenez said she doesn't feel represented by Spain because of its policies and the way it treats Catalans.\"I believe that by being independent we could ... manage ourselves better; we would have another kind of benefits that don't exist within Spain,\" she said. 'A better country'Raul del Hoyo says he believes Catalonia has the potential to be a better country on its own.Raul del Hoyo, 56, a logistics technician, said he feels Spanish as well as Catalan but believes in the region's bid for independence.\"We believe we have sufficient economic potential, social cohesion and initiative to be able to make a better country,\" he said. \"I'm very sad to have seen how the police took people who were only expressing or demonstrating, democratically, their right to vote, and their right to demonstrate on the street in order to achieve a political objective.\"He said he believes there will be negotiations and that the two sides will find a solution that works for them both.\"There could be violence, but if there is violence, I am sure it will be institutional. Catalonia, for decades, not just now, for decades, has always demonstrated democratically its claims,\" he said.\"It's the part of the peninsula, or the part of Spain, that has always voted more in favor of Europe, of democratic values, of its anti-Franco struggle. It's a peaceful people, a people that organized itself around a set of values to grow more. We're not going against anything.\"'They didn't listen to us'Ana, a retiree, says she hopes for dialogue to resolve the situation peacefully.Ana, who didn't want to give her last name for fear of repercussions, said Catalan independence is essential.\"We need to have it. So that all of us take everything that the state from Madrid takes from us,\" she said.A 68-year-old retired administrative executive, Ana has been angered by the central authorities' treatment of Catalans in recent days.\"We've been very peaceful. They didn't listen to us and attacked the people, elderly people, children, very bad,\" she said.\"We hope that they engage in dialogue, that they talk and they fix this because we've never had an issue, between people who don't want independence and people who want it.\"She said she hopes the recent tensions won't deter foreign visitors to Barcelona and the region, saying they will be welcomed with open arms.CNN's Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.",

She was working on a story.Madsen is accused of killing Wall. He denies the allegation and has called her death an accident.The police conducted an autopsy on Wall's head and found no sign of cranium fracture or violence, said Jens Moeller Jensen, who is leading the murder investigation for Copenhagen police. Identification was based on dental records from Sweden, he said.\"We found a bag with Kim Wall's clothing; shirt, skirt, socks and shoes, and also a knife and lead pieces weighing them down,\" Moeller Jensen said. \"Around noon we found a leg, then another leg, and shortly thereafter we found a head, also in a bag weighted down by several metal pieces.\"Read MoreThe submarine dove for several hours overnight from August 10 to 11, during which time police believe Wall's body was cut to pieces, Moeller Jensen said. Officers search for missing body parts of Swedish journalist Kim Wall on August 23, close to the site where her torso was found two days earlier.Divers continued to search Koege Bay on Saturday for the journalist's arms.Police were still working to determine Wall's cause of death, Moeller Jensen said, adding that investigators were focusing on her neck and throat area.Friends' tribute: Wall 'is more than what happened to her'Wall's headless torso washed up on August 21 on an island near Copenhagen, and investigators were able to match blood in the submarine and torso. The charge sheet alleges Madsen cut Wall's body into pieces, punctured her torso and tied pipes to it to make it sink to the bottom of the sea.Madsen: Wall was hit by metal hatchMadsen testified in court last month that Wall was hit in the head by 155-pound metal hatch on the submarine and fell into the water, DR reported.Kim Wall was a journalist most aspire to beAccording to Madsen, Wall was climbing to the top of a platform where he was holding the hatch. He slipped and lost his grip on the hatch, which then hit her on the head, he said. He told the Copenhagen City Court that Wall was badly injured and probably dead.The inventor said he panicked and thought about suicide before deciding instead to dump her body at sea and sink the submarine. He denied having a saw on his vessel when Wall accompanied him, DR reported.Madsen remains in custody while the investigation continues. He has denied accusations that he was responsible for her death. Peter Madsen, pictured on August 11, claims Kim Wall died in an accident aboard his submarine.Talented writer goes missingThe submarine was found on August 11, about 15 hours after it had departed Copenhagen. Madsen was rescued from the sinking vessel and brought ashore, where he was picked up by police, but there was no trace of the missing journalist.Madsen was later arrested and held in custody on suspicion of killing Wall. The inventor originally claimed he had dropped Wall off on land on the night of August 10, according to a police statement.If Madsen is charged with murder and convicted, he faces a sentence of five years to life. The next pre-trial hearing is scheduled for October 31.Wall, a graduate of Columbia University and London School of Economics, was based between Beijing and New York. A talented writer, her work appeared in The New York Times, the Guardian and TIME, among publications.Correction: This story has been updated to clarify that some of Wall's remains were found in a separate bag from her clothing.Journalist Susanne Gargiulo reported from Copenhagen and Katie Polglase from London, while Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.",

It has a bit of everything -- it's demanding, fast, and a big challenge for a driver and for the engineers, so it's the perfect racer's circuit.\"There have been many heroic drives at Suzuka, none greater than Kimi Raikkonen's astonishing victory in 2005 when the Finn took the lead on the final lap after starting the race down in 17th place.Read MoreBut it is the high-speed duels for championship glory that has cemented Suzuka's reputation as one of the must-see races on the F1 calendar. 1988, 1989 & 1990: Prost vs. SennaJUST WATCHEDProst vs. Senna: The Battles of SuzukaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHProst vs. Senna: The Battles of Suzuka 02:50 Few F1 rivalries have matched the intensity between France's Alain Prost and Brazilian Ayrton Senna.A three-act drama began in 1988 when the two were teammates at McLaren. It was first blood to Senna who despite stalling his car at the start recovered to win the race, before going on to seal a first world title at the final race in Australia.  Twelve months later it was Prost in the driving seat at Suzuka. The Frenchman had a 16-point advantage going into the season's penultimate race and led the Japanese GP with six laps to go when Senna, desperate for the win, dived down the inside at the Casio Triangle chicane.

Both cars slewed into the gravel trap and out of the race before Senna and Prost trudged back to the pits.

The Red Bull pairing of Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo enjoyed another good weekend, finishing second and third respectively.

In Brazil, Vettel triumphed once again to record his fifth win of the season and the 47th of his career.

(Source: NFL.com)Hide Caption 1 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 19 (tie): Sam Bradford, $18 million \u2013 After six mostly disappointing seasons in St Louis and Philadelphia, the first overall pick of the 2010 draft has finally found a home. Although Minnesota did not qualify for the playoffs with an 8-8 record, Sam Bradford was mostly error-free, throwing 20 touchdowns and just five interceptions on his way to an excellent 99 passer rating in 2016. Hide Caption 2 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 19 (tie): Brock Osweiler, $18 million \u2013 Brock Osweiler has endured a bumpy road on his way back to Denver. Peyton Manning's former understudy experienced a difficult 2016 spell at Texas (15 TDs, 16 INTs) before being traded to Cleveland and subsequently released. The former Arizona State standout was 5-2 as a starter in Denver filling in for Manning, and Broncos fans hope he can restore some of that magic this season. Hide Caption 3 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 18: Ndamukong Suh, $19.1 million \u2013 Ndamukong Suh was signed by the Miami Dolphins for a six-year, $114 million contract in March 2015, making him the highest paid defensive player in history at the time -- hefty numbers for a 30-year-old lineman who has yet to match the 10 sacks achieved during his rookie season with the Detroit Lions. Hide Caption 4 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 17: Von Miller, $19.1 million \u2013 The MVP of Super Bowl 50 for the Denver Broncos single-handedly badgered Panthers quarterback Cam Newton into submission, with 6 tackles, 2.5 sacks, 2 forced fumbles and 2 quarterback hurries in the title game. Von Miller promptly signed a $114.5 million deal ($70 million guaranteed) with the Broncos, making him the richest defensive player in NFL history. Hide Caption 5 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 16: Ryan Tannehill, $19.25 million \u2013 Though Ryan Tannehill (#17) has shown promise in his five seasons in the league, he suffered a season-ending knee injury in the pre-season. A former part-time receiver in college at Texas A&M, Tannehill has been one of the speediest quarterbacks in the league -- a quality which will be tested after knee surgery. In a 44-26 win against Houston in 2015, Tannehill became the 64th quarterback in NFL history to record a perfect passer rating, throwing four TDs, with 18 completions in 19 attempts. Hide Caption 6 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 15: Tom Brady, $20.5 million \u2013 With five Super Bowl rings, 12 Pro Bowls, four Super Bowl MVP award and two NFL MVP awards, tom Brady is the one player in the list who can claim to be underpaid. At 40, he's on the back end of a two-year, $41 million contract, but has left money on the table in previous negotiations to sign better players around him -- a plan that has yielded a record seven Super Bowl appearances and counting.  Hide Caption 7 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 14: Matt Ryan, $20.75 million \u2013 \"Matty Ice\" will attempt to re-earn his nickname, after suffering perhaps the most remarkable blown lead in sporting history at Super Bowl 51. Up 28-9 going into the fourth quarter, the Falcons handed 25 straight points to New England, with Matt Ryan giving up a crucial fumble and sack in the process. The former Boston College standout and four-time Pro Bowler was inserted as the Atlanta Falcons' starter since being drafted third overall in 2008. Hide Caption 8 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 13: Cam Newton, $20.76 million \u2013 Cam Newton is arguably the most complete player on this list. At 6 foot 6 inches and 260 pounds, he has the size, speed and athleticism -- along with stellar QB instincts -- to take the Carolina Panthers into the playoffs every year. But after a disastrous 2016 season, in which the Panthers went 6-10, \"Killer Cam\" will again trying to erase his unfortunate Super Bowl 50 performance (0 touchdowns, one interception, sacked six times, two fumble losses). Hide Caption 9 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 12: Philip Rivers, $20.81 million \u2013 In his 13-year pro career, Philip Rivers has yet to appear in a Super Bowl, although he has taken the San Diego Chargers into the playoffs five times. The father of eight children has broken most of the major franchise records, surpassing Dan Fouts as the Chargers' all-time touchdown leader, wins leader and consecutive starts leader (185 and counting). In 2014, Rivers broke an NFL record by achieving five consecutive games with a passer rating of above 120. Hide Caption 10 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 11: Eli Manning, $21 million \u2013 The two-time Super Bowl MVP led the Giants back into the playoffs last season, only to lose at Green Bay. At times Eli Manning has befuddled New Yorkers with error-prone performances, but his legacy is cemented in New York sporting lore. His active 211-game playing streak is third all-time for QBs. Hide Caption 11 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 10:  Ben Roethlisberger, $21.85 million  \u2013 Though \"Big Ben\" (#7) has flirted with the idea of retirement, the two-time Super Bowl champion shows no sign of slowing down. Shaking off some niggling injuries, Ben Roethlisberger had an excellent 2016 campaign, earning his fifth Pro Bowl selection before taking his Steelers to the AFC Conference Finals. Hide Caption 12 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 9: Russell Wilson, $21.9 million  \u2013 It's ironic that Russell Wilson threw the most famous interception in NFL history -- the last-minute gaff which cost the Seattle Seahawks the 2015 Super Bowl -- because the 28-year-old three-time Pro Bowler plays virtually error-free. Though standing at just 5 foot 11 inches, Wilson was the top-rated NFL quarterback in 2015, and is second all-time, trailing only Aaron Rodgers.  Hide Caption 13 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 8:  Aaron Rodgers, $22 million \u2013 That Aaron Rodgers holds the top career passer rating record while playing in frozen Lambeau Field is a testament to his talent. Rodgers led the Green Bay Packers to a 2011 championship, and is riding an eight-year playoff streak into 2017. But despite posting stellar regular-season numbers in the six seasons since the Super Bowl (a mind-boggling 219 TDs and just 41 INTs) the Packers have come up short in the playoffs. Hide Caption 14 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 7: Joe Flacco, $22.13 million \u2013 When the Baltimore Ravens offered a three-year, $66.4 million ($44 million guaranteed) deal to Joe Flacco in 2016, it seemed like an aberration. In his 10 seasons, the 32-year-old has yet to make a Pro Bowl. But traditionally the Ravens have thrived on defense, and until Flacco came along in 2008, the team won in spite of its sputtering quarterbacks. The 2013 Super Bowl MVP brings a calm presence to a team which suffered a leadership vacuum after the retirements of Ed Reed and Ray Lewis.   Hide Caption 15 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 6: Kirk Cousins, $23.9 million \u2013 \"You like that?\" Kirk Cousins, who led Washington to the playoffs in 2015 behind that rallying cry, signed his second consecutive one-year deal in the off-season. Unable to come to a long-term deal with the Redskins, the 29-year-old settled for one year and nearly $24 million. Hide Caption 16 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 5: Drew Brees, $24.3 million \u2013 It's hard to overestimate Drew Brees' value to the city of New Orleans. When the former Charger joined the Saints in 2006, the year after Hurricane Katrina, the team was 3-13. Four years later, New Orleans won its first and only Super Bowl. The 10-time Pro Bowler holds team passing records in every major category.  He has also been a face of the community, raising funds for cancer research and other charitable causes. Hide Caption 17 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 4: Carson Palmer, $24.4 million \u2013 Carson Palmer, a three-time Pro Bowl selection, is entering his 14th NFL season. The 37-year-old signed a one-year deal with Arizona in the off season. Hide Caption 18 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 3:  Andrew Luck, $24.6 million \u2013 Andrew Luck -- whose $140 million, six-year deal is still the highest contract total in history -- bounced back from an injury-riddled  2015 to post 31 TDs and just 13 interceptions last season. His off-season shoulder surgery, however, sidelines him for the start of the 2017 campaign. Hide Caption 19 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 2: Derek Carr, $25 million \u2013 The Oakland Raiders made Derek Carr their franchise QB this offseason with a five-year, $125 million deal -- briefly crowning the former Fresno State man as the highest paid player in the league. Carr has been a Pro-Bowler two of his first three seasons in Oakland. Hide Caption 20 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 1: Matthew Stafford, $27 million \u2013 Weeks before the start of the 2017 campaign, Detroit made Stafford the highest-paid player in NFL history with a five year, $135 million deal. Though he is yet to win a playoff game, Stafford is the Lions' all-time leader in passing yards and touchdowns. The nine-year veteran's 99-game starting streak is 11th best of all time.

        "content": "London (CNN)You know things are going badly when even the writing on the wall falls off.British Prime Minister Theresa May's attempt to relaunch her faltering premiership was badly derailed Wednesday when a keynote speech was marred by an interruption from a prankster, a prolonged coughing fit and finally the disintegration of the stage set behind her. An often excruciating address to members of her party was punctuated by coughs, splutters and brief interludes to sip water. May was left fighting to finish, barely audible, in front of a packed hall full of delegates at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester.May, who lost her overall governing majority in the last election, had hoped to relaunch her premiership with her keynote speech. But soon after beginning her address, she was accosted by comedian Lee Nelson, real name Simon Brodkin, who strolled up to the stage and handed her a P45 -- a form that UK employees are given when they leave a company, similar to a \"pink slip\" in the US.Hi @BorisJohnson, I gave Theresa her P45 just like you asked. pic.twitter.com/gzW0UluDMv\u2014 Simon Brodkin (@simonbrodkin) October 4, 2017\nBrodkin, who has performed similar stunts in the past, including throwing money over former FIFA President Sepp Blatter at a press conference in 2015, told reporters that he was put up to it by Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a former rival to May in her leadership bid. \"Boris told me to do it,\" he was heard as saying -- presumably in jest.Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May holds up a throat lozenge given to her by Britain's Chancellor  Philip Hammond .Read MoreWhile May managed to shrug off  the incident as Brodkin was led away by security, she was unable to recover from coughing fits that plagued her.To compound her misery, part of the stage furniture began to fall down as she continued to struggle on.  Two letters fell from the slogan behind May, which had read: \"Building a country that works for everyone,\" until the \"F\" in \"for\" and the final \"E\" in \"everyone\" dropped to the ground. An 'F' falls off the backdrop as British Prime Minister Theresa May delivers her keynote speech.Delegates rose from the floor to cheer encouragement, while her finance minister, Phillip Hammond, came to the stage to offer a cough lozenge. After the speech, the beleaguered Prime Minister tried to make light of the mishaps, posting a photograph on Twitter showing a view of her desk complete with a copy of her speech, her official red box and multiple types of cough medicines. coughs pic.twitter.com/1b6CoW5Mrz\u2014 Theresa May (@theresa_may) October 4, 2017\nGreater Manchester Police later said that Brodkin was briefly arrested but released shortly after. Chief Superintendent John O'Hare confirmed that Brodkin had legitimate accreditation that gave him access to the conference site before adding that the accreditation process will be reviewed with the Conservative Party. For May, the timing was particularly cruel, amid continued speculation over her leadership after the poor result in a general election she called for June.She was fiercely criticized for calling the snap election and used the speech to apologize for a campaign that she labeled as \"too scripted, too presidential.\"Britain's Home Secretary Amber Rudd (C) listens to the speech by Prime Minister Theresa May.\"We did not get the victory we wanted because our national campaign fell short. It was too scripted, too presidential and it allowed the Labour party to paint us as the party of continuity when the public wanted to hear a message of change,\" she said.\"I hold my hands up for that. I take responsibility. I led the campaign, and I am sorry.\"",

That race will be sailed in traditional monohull boats instead of the multihull yachts used in the last three editions of sailing's most prestigious event.\"I wanted to race the day after we lost, to go out and reverse the result,\" he said. \"But it's too early to say really.

'We are in the entertainment business'Usain Bolt wins 2016 IAAF male world athlete of the year.The Jamaican sprinter's departure has left a \"Bolt-shaped hole\" for the sport to fill and Coe called on the current crop of athletes to be more like the Jamaican and \"recognize that they are in the entertainment business.\" \"They have to have an opinion and they have to dominate a room, they have to dominate a stadium,\" said Coe, who is a former middle-distance runner and two-time Olympic Champion and served as a Conservative MP for five years in the 1990s.READ: Farewell Usain Bolt, a wonder of our sporting ageREAD: Usain Bolt urges other athletes to save athletics\"Too often I sit there, because I go to a lot of these post-race news conferences, and I'm thinking, \"Are you really offering as much as you should in terms of the insight and the accessibility?\"They've got to be interesting, they've got to have an opinion and that's what takes the sport beyond the stadium. We can't [avoid the issue] anymore. They have to reach out.    \"Sometimes there are linguistic challenges. The world media is an English-based media so we need to make sure we do the media training and encourage federations and athletes to recognize that they have all got skin in the game here.\"'I'm on the side of personal freedoms'New Orleans Saints players kneel at Wembley Stadium.In recent weeks a number of NFL stars have discovered what it means to have \"skin in the game\" after US President Donald Trump described players who kneel during the National Anthem to protest social injustice as \"sons of bitches\" and called on team owners to fire them.If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017\nThe issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race. It is about respect for our Country, Flag and National Anthem. NFL must respect this!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 25, 2017\n\"I'm on the side of personal freedoms, always. You have to be,\" said Coe, who says he has no problem with athletes bringing politics to the sporting arena. \"Sport has rarely just mirrored society. It's more often than not set its trends if you look back to Jesse Owens' stance in Berlin and the salutes in 1968,\" he added, referring to to John Carlos and Tommie Smith's Black Power salute at the Mexico Olympics. \"It's important sport has a view.\"Frankly, I'm not sure that most of those [NFL] players were particularly bothered [by Trump's comments]. They decided to do what they did.\"\"I've never felt particularly under pressure from any political leader, even in 1979/1980,\" added Coe who defied United Kingdom Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's attempts to block British athletes from competing at the 1980 Moscow Olympics over Russia's invasion of Afghanistan.Sebastian Coe crosses the finish line to win 1500m gold at the 1980 Moscow Olympics.'Encouraged' by Russian responseLast month US Anti-Doping Agency Chief, Travis Tygart called on the International Olympic Committee to ban Russia from the upcoming Winter Olympics in South Korea, given the evidence that has emerged of a state-sponsored doping program at the 2014 Sochi Games. Coe's IAAF made a bold call to ban Russia ahead of the 2016 Summer Olympics and, while he does not have a view on Russian participation at the Winter Olympics, he told journalists that he was encouraged by Russia's response over the last 12 months. USADA CEO Travis Tygart wants Russia banned from Winter Olympics.\"We have set the criteria and if they meet the criteria, then that's when we can start looking at re-introduction,\" Coe said. \"They've made positive steps. [President of the Russia Federation] Dimitri Shlyakhtin made a speech at [the IAAF Congress] which I thought was pretty candid about the challenges that they'd had and what they needed to do.\"They weren't pleading for reinstatement but just talking about the journey they were on. And I thought that was very encouraging.\"We have to be realistic about it, you're not going to make that shift overnight. \"Whenever reintroduction takes place, it's not then a hands off approach. You need to make sure that monitoring is permanent and regular.\"'Why are we wedded to a 400-meter track?'Coe was elected IAAF President in August 2015.Coe has no control over the Olympics but is determined to modernize the IAAF Diamond League season, one-day events and even alter the format of the World Championships in an effort to attract new sponsors and partners to \"set the sport on its way for the next 30 years.\" \"Why are we wedded to a 400m track all the time? Coe questioned.\"Why not have pop-up tracks? 300m or 200m tracks in football stadia, taking the sport where we can get people in without necessarily having to be in a championship stadium.\"Franchises, what about having the excitement of the draft? The Indian Premier League auction? Those are the things I really want to have on the table and I don't want to take them off the table. We have to be radical.\"'We have to connect with ordinary runners'Millions of people around the world run in their free time, but Coe is conscious that athletics has failed to make the connection with amateurs in the way other sports have done so effectively. \"People run,\" Coe said. \"We have to make a closer connection with what they're doing on a Saturday morning or in a charity run.Runners cross Tower Bridge during the 2016 London Marathon.\"I pad up occasionally [for a game of cricket] and, for a few delusional moments on the village green, think I'm Sachin Tendulkar,\" added Coe, referring to the great Indian batsman.\"I'm not sure many people that go out and run the London Marathon think of themselves as being in the same sport as Usain Bolt or Haile Gebrselassie. We have to make that linkage.\"Usain Bolt celebrates at London 2012 OlympicsGo to CNN.com/sport for more stories & featuresCoe cited the success eSports has had in attracting youngsters over the last 15 years and believes it is now up to him and the athletics federations to get them back \"from the virtual, into reality and on to the track.\"Over to you Usain ...",

After coming close on multiple occasions, it was that man Al Somah who looked to have finally drawn the scores level.Firas Al Khatib, widely considered Syria's greatest player and on with fresh legs as a second half substitute, got to the byline and clipped a cross to the near post.Al Somah's header hit the post, hit goalkeeper Matthew Ryan on the shoulder, before again hitting the post and bouncing fortuitously into Ryan's grateful arms.Far from being discouraged though, Syria pressed on. Seemingly out of luck all game, it was a stroke of good fortune -- or generous refereeing -- which eventually gave them a route back into the game.JUST WATCHEDIn war-torn Aleppo, football returnsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHIn war-torn Aleppo, football returns 02:13Al Somah was deemed to have been fouled in the air by Mathew Leckie while jumping for a cross and Iranian official Alireza Faghani pointed to the spot -- a soft decision by any standards.The Al Ahli striker picked himself up and, coolness personified, dispatched the ball emphatically into the top corner, sending the sizable Syrian contingent in the stands wild.With five minutes still left to play -- plus five of injury time -- Syria continued to press forward in search of a late winner.It almost came from an unlikely source, left-back Moayad Ajan's pile driver had Ryan at full stretch, tipping the strike inches over the crossbar.With the final whistle, a visibly emotional Syrian team sunk to their knees, heads to the ground in prayer.Having come so far -- now to within three games of the World Cup -- who would begrudge them continuing to hope.

We will go home and get them on a good pitch in front of our home fans.\"Aaron Mooy, currently playing in the Premier League with Huddersfield and arguably Australia's best player, echoed the sentiments of his compatriot.\"There was a decision that didn't go our way but you just have to recover and get ready for the next game,\" he said.",

Among their claims were rape and indecent assault against children. \"The report does not draw any conclusions as to the likely guilt or innocence of Sir Edward Heath, or make any comment on the action the Crown Prosecution Service may have taken if he was alive today,\" Wiltshire Police Chief Constable Mike Veale told reporters. \"The role of the police service is very clear in the criminal justice process. The police have a duty to investigate and go where the evidence takes us. It is not our role to prove the innocence or guilt, but to simply present the facts.\" Read MoreThe Edward Heath Charitable Foundation, set up in 2005 after the former leader's death, put out a statement describing the report as \"profoundly unsatisfactory\" as it neither proved or disproved the sex abuse allegations.\"All those who knew Sir Edward Heath or worked with him are, without exception, convinced that the allegations of child abuse will all be found to be groundless. Everything that is known of his character, his habits, his intelligence and his principles supports this view,\" said the statement, attributed to the foundation's chair Lord Hunt, and Lord Armstrong of Ilminster, who served as a Cabinet Secretary to Heath.'Watershed moment'Heath led a Conservative government in the UK from 1970 to 1974 and served in Parliament until 2001. He died in 2005 at age 89 and has become the most senior figure to be investigated for child sex abuse allegations dating back decades.Britain has been rocked in recent years by a series of revelations involving the sexual abuse of children by public figures -- including UK entertainer Jimmy Savile -- and allegations that the British establishment may have sought to cover up historic abuse claims involving some former senior politicians.Entertainers Rolf Harris and Gary Glitter were convicted of sexual offenses dating back as much as four decades.Chief Constable Veale described the report's publication as a \"watershed moment\" for victims who have complained of cover-ups of child sex abuse committed by state figures.",

        "content": "(CNN)Catalonia's leader has launched a strongly worded attack on the King of Spain for failing to heal the country's divisions after a bitterly contested independence referendum.In a TV address from the headquarters of the Catalan government in Barcelona on Wednesday, Catalan President Carles Puigdemont said King Felipe had missed an opportunity to mediate in the political and constitutional crisis that has engulfed the country. The King delivered a stern warning in a TV address on Tuesday, saying Catalan leaders had acted \"outside the law\" and accusing them of \"unacceptable disloyalty\" for pressing ahead with their moves toward secession.. Catalonia is an autonomous region of Spain, located in the northeastern part of the country.Puigdemont said the Spanish monarch \"ignores millions of Catalans who think in a different way\" to the central government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy.\"You disappointed many people in Catalonia who appreciate you and are expecting a call to dialogue,\" Puigdemont said after the King's hard-line remarks.Read MoreThe King has a constitutional duty to arbitrate when there is a diplomatic dispute, Puigdemont said. \"We need mediation,\" he said. \"This conflict needs to be resolved in a political way, not with police.\"He directed parts of his address to Spaniards in other parts of the nation, to the King and to Catalonians.Urging calmPuigdemont is expected to formally declare independence on Monday, after 90% of voters in last Sunday's referendum opted for a split. The vote was marred by clashes between citizens and Spanish police.Puigdemont urged calm. \"Let's not allow other people to provoke us.  Let's not fall into provocations of violence,\" he said.Puigdemont said that while others say the vote was illegal, Catalonia will follow \"a democratic way\" that should be respected. The Spanish government on Wednesday said it \"strongly rejects the accusations\" Puigdemont directed at the King.\"These accusations show that Mr. Puigdemont not only is against the law, but also is outside reality,\" the government said. \"Tonight he lost every opportunity to bring Catalonia back to the path of coexistence within the law. Far from that, he went one step further in his path to radicalization, isolation and defiance of institutions.\"JUST WATCHEDTensions high after Catalonia referendum voteReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTensions high after Catalonia referendum vote 02:30Puigdemont's remarks came as the Catalans' standoff with Madrid deepened Wednesday. Spain's highest court summoned the chief of the Catalan police to answer accusations of sedition, or provoking a rebellion against the state.Josep Llu\u00eds Trapero was called to testify in Madrid on Friday: Spanish authorities believe Trapero's 17,000-strong force did not do enough to prevent the banned referendum from taking place. Sedition by public officials carries a 15-year sentence in Spain.He was ordered to appear with three others: his deputy Teresa Laplana and the leaders of pro-independence groups Catalan National Assembly and Omnium Cultural, Jordi Cuixart and Jordi Sanchez.Protesters joined by firefighters raise their hands as they gather during a general strike in Barcelona Tuesday.Puigdemont is due to address the Catalan Parliament on Monday, in a session called to \"discuss the results of the referendum on October 1 and its effects,\" a statement from the parliament said.It will be Puigdemont's first opportunity to make a formal declaration of independence under the Catalan referendum law that was ruled illegal by Spain's top court.Such a move would severely test the government of Prime Minister Rajoy. If Madrid decides that Catalonia is acting unconstitutionally, Rajoy could invoke emergency powers to take control of the Catalan government.That would almost certainly require officers from the Guardia Civil, the national security force, to be deployed again on the streets of Catalonia. Thousands are on standby in the port of Barcelona, and their redeployment would be highly provocative after they led a violent crackdown of Sunday's referendum.     Business groups rattledThe prospect of a rupture in Spain's young democracy -- the dictatorship of Francisco Franco ended only in 1975 -- has rattled business groups.The Spanish business lobby group, Cercle d'Economia, said it was concerned by the prospect of a declaration of independence and called for both sides to start talks. \"Such a declaration would plunge the country into an extraordinarily complex situation with unknown, but very serious consequences,\" the group said in a statement reported by Reuters Wednesday.JUST WATCHEDA look inside Catalonia's referendum voteReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHA look inside Catalonia's referendum vote 02:43The developments have also alarmed the European Union, which has so far supported Madrid. Speaking at a debate on Catalonia in the European Parliament on Wednesday, European Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans called for dialogue. \"All lines of communication must stay open. It's time to talk to find a way out of the impasse,\" he said.Timmermans backed the Spanish government's stance: \"This is an internal matter for Spain that has to be dealt with in line with the constitutional order of Spain,\" he said.But he lamented Sunday's events, when the Guardia Civil raided polling stations, fired rubber bullets and dragged people out of voting centers. \"Violence does not solve anything in politics,\" he said. The referendum and its aftermath has split Catalans. Some 90% of voters backed a split from Spain, but turnout was only around 42%, largely because anti-independence Catalans did not show up. Barcelona taxi driver Ana Maria Lopez, who opposes a split, said Puigdemont \"thinks he's a king\" and said a declaration of independence would be meaningless: \"Him declaring independence is like me declaring 'from tomorrow I'm a princess,' \" she told CNN.But like many in Catalonia, she was critical of the central government in Madrid, saying its poor handling of the situation had made things worse.Anti-independence groups staged a small demonstration in Barcelona on Wednesday evening. About 200 people gathered in front of Spanish government buildings and chanted\"You are not alone\" and \"This is our police\" to the officers from the Spanish National Police and Guardia Civil who guard the buildings.CNN's Milena Veselinovic, Matt Wells and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.",

Now CNN has learned more details of the extraordinary covert operation that was mounted to ensure the referendum took place.A network of thousands of officials and volunteers squirreled away ballot boxes, conferred by encrypted messages and met in secret in an effort to get as many people to the polls as possible.JUST WATCHEDHow Catalonia's independence crisis unfoldedReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHow Catalonia's independence crisis unfolded 02:24From the educators who opened up their schools to the people who ferried the ballots and anyone who counted the votes, all risked a fine of up to 300,000 euros (about $350,000).

Aleix, not his real name -- he spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity to avoid potential legal ramifications -- coordinated the operation at a polling station on the outskirts of Barcelona, the regional capital.His involvement began three months ago with a phone call from referendum organizers. \"They knew me, that I would help. So they called me,\" Aleix told CNN.Secret meetingsPhone calls turned into texts and a virtual game of cat and mouse. The plotters started using Whatsapp, but were worried it was compromised and turned to other encrypted platforms such as Telegram and Signal. Meetings were held in secret, some were canceled last minute out of fear.\"In the end (everyone involved) met three days before the vote,\" Aleix says. \"I bumped into people I didn't know would be there. Everything was very secretive.\"The ballot boxes were assembled at the last minute, he said. In order to try to fool Spanish authorities, the components -- the plastic box, the lid, the insignias, and the box ties -- were stored in separate places.The night before the vote, he and other activists slept at his assigned school to make sure authorities didn't seal it off. People tucked into sleeping bags spread across the gym floor. In the middle of the night, he says, he got a call asking him to move some ballot boxes and ballots.\"I was sleeping at the school and (the caller) told me to meet him somewhere in the city to move the material from one car to another,\" Aleix says. \"We brought the material to three different schools.\"People queue to vote in the banned referendum on Catalonia's independence.By dawn there was a line of voters snaked around the school corner. Some stood for hours, hearts racing as word spread that polling stations were being raided.  Tweets and Facebook posts popped up on smartphones, showing voters and coordinators being beaten by the national police.\"We were informed the police had paid a visit to a school five minutes away from ours and there had been very violent clashes,\" Aleix says. \"I was the person in charge of that school. I felt pressure and was scared that people there would be beaten, that police would storm in violently and hurt many old people and children. My family was there, my parents were there, so that fear was there.\"Madrid denies that excessive force was used. \"If there was any use of force by police, in any way, it was because they were prevented from doing what they were asked to do,\" Spanish Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis told CNN.Voting irregularitiesVoting was plagued by technical difficulties and confusion. Aleix says some volunteers only received their instructions at the last minute, and the websites they were using to check voter identification jammed; he was meant to coordinate four voting stations but for most the day he was only able to run two.Catalan independence vote caps four centuries of mistrustHe admits there were irregularities. At some stations, voter identities could not be verified electronically. People were allowed to vote anyway. The final result is still being tallied.The Catalan President, Carles Puigdemont, is expected to make a unilateral declaration of independence at some point after a special session of the Catalan Parliament on Monday.On Wednesday evening in Barcelona, a small group of Catalans who oppose independence gathered to show their support for Spanish institutions. Some of those who spoke to CNN said they felt that a large number of Catalans who oppose independence feel unable to speak out for fear of recriminations in the current polarized atmosphere.But despite all of the problems, Aleix insists this referendum reflects the will of Catalans.\"The problem may be that people didn't want to vote out of fear of the police,\" he says. \"The result maybe is not the best because not all the people finally vote. But I think it is legitimate.\"",

For some players, that might mean making a statement by taking a knee when the national anthem is played before a game. For others, it can also mean trying to make a difference beyond their own country.Denver Broncos guard Max Garcia helped Denver win the Super Bowl in his first season, but now he's turning his attention to the bigger picture. As he told CNN: \"When the lights are off and you're not famous anymore, you're going to look back and say what did I do?\" In June, Garcia and five other NFL players traveled to Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, with the NGO International Justice Mission (IJM) to learn more about human trafficking and, in particular, the sexual exploitation of children.

When IJM arrived to help a decade later, they claim they found minors being exploited for sex in 90% of the communities they studied. \"You can find cases of children being exploited pretty much anywhere in the country,\" says Fernando Rodriguez, IJM's local field office director.In fact, IJM says that 1 in 10 victims of commercial sexual exploitation in the Dominican Republic are children.More on human trafficking from the CNN Freedom ProjectIt would be easy to blame the tourism trade for the problem -- the country welcomes 5 million visitors every year -- but investigators also blame poverty and a lack of education. According to The World Bank, one third of Dominicans live below the poverty line and that poverty is easy to spot when you drive away from the all-inclusive luxury resorts.Tackling exploitation has been an uphill battle. Such work necessitates time and resources, both of which are in short supply. In a population of more than 10 million people, IJM says that just six officers in the public ministry's anti-trafficking unit are properly trained and equipped to actively pursue sex trafficking cases. IJM says the abuse comes in many forms: youngsters befriended by pedophiles on the beach, young girls delivered to men on the back of a motorbike, or even exploited at home, by their own families. JUST WATCHEDExploited women get a second chanceReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHExploited women get a second chance 03:30The most disturbing stories for the IJM investigators are the ones in which the parents have put their children to work in the sex trade, both young girls and boys. One of IJM's undercover agents is still haunted by the case of an eight-year-old boy. The boy was the subject of a series of pornographic home videos that were uploaded to a distributor in Spain. His mother, now serving a 20-year jail sentence, made $4,000 for the films, according to IJM. It estimates that between 8 and 10 percent of the child victims they work with are male but it's hard to know for sure how many are affected overall because boys are less likely to report the abuse for fear of being stigmatized. Read: Sex trafficking - the new American slaveryReasons for optimismSince IJM's arrival, its operatives on the ground say that they have seen enough progress to be optimistic. Just two years ago, the national police force's human trafficking department couldn't boast of even one successful case. With IJM's help, that number became three in 2016 and so far by the time of our visit in July, it's five. IJM's aftercare director, Daisy Nunez, tells CNN, \"We're on it, we can see changes in the government and we have data to support it.\" In their day jobs, the NFL players who traveled to the Dominican Republic are big, tough, fearless men, but this trip was an altogether different experience. As they interacted with some of the young girls who'd been rescued, I often caught them lost in thought or on the verge of tears, aghast at the abuse suffered by the victims.

CNN has blurred some of the faces in this photo in order to respect their privacy.Baltimore Ravens tight end Benjamin Watson was taken to visit the Boca Chica red-light district, where he was told that children were being exploited just out of sight, around the corner. \"It seems to be commonplace,\" Watson says. \"It's in the open, with no remorse and no consequence.\"'Glimmer of hope'Before the NFL players left for the airport and returned to training camp, they visited another group of children, this time mainly young boys, for a \"day of joy.\" It's hard to imagine what the boys must have been through in the past, but on this day, they were smiling as they learned how to spiral-throw a football from some of the best players in the world. For most of them, language was a barrier, but the language of sport needs no translation. \"That kid can ball,\" exclaimed Garcia, clearly impressed.

But on this occasion, making a personal connection was the most important thing -- showing people who have suffered so much that there are people who care and who want to help them.  Watson said that he left with the knowledge that the problem was bigger than he thought, but that the children's smiles demonstrated \"a glimmer of hope.\" For Don Davis, a two-time Super Bowl champion with the New England Patriots, it put his life's work into perspective. \"Playing football and winning championships is so minor when you are doing good for people who don't even know your name,\" he said. \"To bring someone who is suffering some relief, there's no better feeling than that.\"",

        "content": "Story highlightsWNBA players protesting during FinalsSocial activism high among playersProtests predate NFL movement (CNN)The NFL may be stealing all the headlines when it comes to its National Anthem spat with US President Donald Trump, but women's professional basketball has been consistently taking an even greater stand on its biggest stage. For the first four games of their WNBA Finals series against the Minnesota Lynx, the entire Los Angeles Sparks team has remained in the locker room -- even staging a collective walkout before Game 1 to a clatter of boos. Follow @cnnsport\n\nOn Wednesday, defending champion Sparks opted to stay on the court before their decisive Game 5 85-76 defeat by the Lynx team as Minnesota won its fourth title.\"Their efforts are sometimes overshadowed by the men, but I think it's important that we recognize and credit them,\" Kristen Clarke, the president of the National Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights, told CNN Sport.NFL stars continue protests and remain defiantClarke notes that the personal experiences of black women in the WNBA (comprising nearly 69% of the league, according to The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport) lend themselves to being politically vocal.  Read More\"The WNBA has a fair number of African-American women who understand what it means to be discriminated on the basis of their race and gender, so they lie on the intersection of a lot of the problems that have beleaguered our country,\" she says. \"They have something to say about many of the crises that are unfolding across our country, and some of what they have to say is informed by their own personal experiences with injustice.\" Sylvia Fowles #34 of the Minnesota Lynx and Nneka Ogwumike #30 of the Los Angeles Sparks battle for position in Game 1.'Not even about the flag'Ahead of Game 2, Sparks guard Essence Carson said that people had forgotten what sports stars' protests -- be it men and women -- were really about.\"You're standing for what you believe in, bringing attention to something that needs attention brought to,\" Carson told TMZ Sports. \"I felt like everyone is so focused on the flag, and it's not even about the flag. It's about racial inequality, criminal justice reform, police brutality, and everything along those lines.\"Although WNBA Commissioner Lisa Borders must be mindful of her players' potential to alienate the league's niche fan base, she has been supportive of their right to protest thus far. \"Our players are some of the most socially conscious that you will ever find,\" Borders told reporters in anticipation of the protest before Game 1 of the Finals. \"You have seen that in the years before I got here, and I'm sure it will continue in the future.\"'Impactful' Indeed, the movement is nothing new for the WNBA. Kneeling or linking arms during the national anthem is not an unusual scene before games, with momentum for protest gaining popularity after each racially charged incident of note. In August, Sparks players linked arms with their counterparts on the Washington Mystics before a nationally televised game that followed a death during a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. As American sports figures sound off on politics, their European counterparts stay silentThe WNBA's continued protests, along with those in other sports, are playing a valid role in society according to Clarke.\"I absolutely believe the protests have been impactful,\" says Clarke, who has worked closely with the New York Liberty. \"They have helped to keep these issues front and center, and sustain a real dialogue in our country about police brutality and other crises.\"READ: Soft power and soccer's mega transfersREAD: Will Messi make it to the World Cup in Russia?'We want to use our platforms'NFL players began to kneel during the national anthem last year, when then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand during \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" before kickoff, sparking both support and backlash.Yet even before Kaepernick garnered mass attention during the 2016 NFL season, women's basketball has been at the forefront of social protest in the US.Before a game in July, 2016, teammates on the Lynx addressed police conduct in the wake of the killings of Philando Castile in Minnesota and Alton Sterling in Louisiana. Players wore black T-shirts during warmups with messages of support for the Black Lives Matter movement, and were followed by members of other teams including the New York Liberty. With greater awareness, NFL players learning how not to go broke. In addition, four teams staged media \"blackouts\" where they refused to speak about basketball, only accepting questions that dealt with issues related to the protest. Players were fined $500 each for violating the league's uniform policy, while their teams were fined $5,000 apiece.Yet WNBA players did not stay silent, challenging the fines on social media and in press conferences until they were rescinded days later.  \"We want to be able to use our platforms, use our voices,\" Liberty guard and WNBA Players Association vice president Tanisha Wright said in reaction to the fines. \"We don't want to let anyone silence us in what we want to talk about. It's unfortunate that the WNBA has fined us and has not supported its players.\"\"We'll deal with it when it happens\"The NBA -- which has been subsidizing the WNBA since its inception in 1997 -- did not fine LeBron James and other star players from making a similar stance during warmups in 2014.Although the leagues are closely tied, each has its own set of standards when it comes to player conduct. While the NBA mandates that its players stand for the national anthem, commissioner Adam Silver did not commit to fining players for protesting when the new season starts this month, saying only \"we'll deal with it when it happens.\"Regardless of who wins the championship on Wednesday, don't count on WNBA players quieting down next season. \"All we can do is keep delivering our message in whatever way (we) feel comfortable in delivering it,\" says Carson, \"and hopefully one day they'll finally understand the point of it all.\"",

        "content": "Barcelona, Spain (CNN)Catalan's secessionist leaders appear determined to defy the King of Spain and go ahead with a unilateral declaration of independence -- a move that would steer the country's deepening constitutional crisis into uncharted waters.The office of the Catalan President Carles Puigdemont said he would appear before the regional parliament on Monday, despite a warning from the monarch that Catalan leaders had acted \"outside the law\" of Spain by holding a banned referendum on independence.Puigdemont, who told the BBC that an independence declaration would come within days, is due to address Catalans in a TV broadcast from Barcelona on Wednesday evening.JUST WATCHEDSpanish FM: No excessive use of force in CataloniaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSpanish FM: No excessive use of force in Catalonia 05:19The Catalan police force, Mossos, told CNN that Spain's high court had summoned highest-ranking officer to answer accusations of sedition -- provoking a rebellion against the state. Spanish authorities believe local police did not do enough to prevent Sunday's banned independence vote from taking place.Both sides appeared set on a collision course after the referendum went ahead in the face of a violent police crackdown.Read MoreKing Felipe's rare TV speech was unexpectedly hardline -- he accused pro-independence leaders of \"unacceptable disloyalty\" and made no mention of the nearly 900 people injured in clashes with Spain's national security forces.Instead, the monarch blamed the referendum's organizers for the strife.In a BBC interview recorded before the King's statement, Puigdemont said his government would \"act at the end of this week or the beginning of next\" to split from Spain. A unilateral declaration of independence would severely test the government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. If Madrid decides that Catalonia is acting unconstitutionally, it could invoke emergency powers to take control of the Catalan government.Protesters gather at the Placa de la Universitat square in Barcelona in Tuesday's day of protest against police violence.The sight of Spanish forces seizing Catalan institutions would further polarize opinion in the region, reeling from Sunday's crackdown. Barcelona's city police said 700,000 people took part Tuesday in a day of protest against the police violence.Spain's Foreign Minister denied that security forces used excessive force on Sunday. \"If there was any use of force by police in any way it was because they were prevented from doing what they were asked to do,\" Alfonso Dastis told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. King's hardline speechIn his TV address, King Felipe called the situation \"extremely serious\" and said the pro-independence camp had demonstrated \"an unacceptable disloyalty towards the powers of the state -- a state that represents Catalan interests.\"The \"irresponsible attitude\" of the regional government has \"put the economic and social stability of Catalonia and Spain at risk,\" he said.The King of Spain delivers his TV address Tuesday night.The King said Catalan authorities had acted \"outside the law\" and emphasized the crown's firm support for the constitution, reiterating \"commitment as King to the unity and permanence of Spain.\"The King's address made it clear that he supported the stance of Rajoy, who has refused to entertain dialogue with the Catalan authorities.JUST WATCHEDCatalonia: What you need to knowReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCatalonia: What you need to know 01:10Rajoy has the option of imposing direct rule on Catalonia under Article 155 of the Spanish constitution, drawn up after the Franco military dictatorship was toppled in 1975. Regions like Catalonia and the Basque country were given sweeping freedoms and control, but the constitution also protected the integrity of Spain and gave Madrid powers to seize back control if regions acted beyond the law.Such a move would be a last resort. Puigdemont told the BBC it would be \"an error which changes everything.\"Pablo Guillen Alvarez, an economist and \u200eassociate professor at the University of Sydney, said article 155 gave Madrid wide powers. \"The central government can run the police, the schools, hospitals in lieu of the Catalan government, and the Catalan government couldn't legally do any thing against it,\" he said. Independence riskDeclaring independence would be a huge gamble for Puigdemont. While there was broad support for holding the referendum, support for independence is not overwhelming in Catalonia. Catalan independence vote caps four centuries of mistrustCatalan authorities said 90% of voters in Sunday's referendum backed a split from Madrid -- but turnout was only 42%. The Catalan government blamed the crackdown for the low turnout and said up to 770,000 votes were lost as a result of raids at polling stations.Taxi driver Ana Maria Lopez is among the Catalans who oppose independence for Catalonia, telling CNN that Puigdemont \"thinks he's a king.\" She added: \"Him declaring independence is like me declaring 'From tomorrow I'm a princess.'\"At the same time, she was critical of the central government in Madrid, saying its poor handling of the situation had made things worse.Alvarez said an independence declaration was \"tempting\" for Puigdemont. \"People in the streets are calling for it ... and the central government seems unrepentant, committed to cracking down on the pro-independence movement.\"JUST WATCHEDTensions high after Catalonia referendum voteReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTensions high after Catalonia referendum vote 02:30He suggested Puigdemont may be trying to gain leverage from the central government.

Soon after a man of the match display in his first game back -- a 3-0 win over Colombia which proved to be a false dawn -- Messi led the national team in a boycott of the Argentine media.A few months later, in a home victory over Chile, Messi was banned for four games for verbally abusing an assistant referee, though that ban was overturned after the Barcelona star had already served one match of the suspension.Messi shows his dejection after being defeated by Chile in the 2016 Copa America final.It's a sign of the instability of the Argentina team that it's had three coaches during these qualifiers. Gerardo Martino, who led Argentina to successive Copa America final defeats, was succeeded by Edgardo Bauza.A string of poor results, coupled with Jorge Sampaoli's availability at the end of the season with Sevilla, saw Bauza leave his post and finally allow the 57-year-old former Chile coach to take his dream job.Argentina's remaining make or break fixtures come at home to Peru, South America's in-form side, and away to Ecuador in the altitude of Quito.Thursday's match against Peru will be played at Boca Juniors' Bombonera stadium in Buenos Aires rather than their traditional venue of the Monumental stadium, which is home to Boca's rivals River Plate.The Bombonera is famed for its raucous atmosphere, though it was also where Peru drew 2-2 with Argentina in a World Cup qualifier in 1969 to ensure the Albiceleste wouldn't go to the 1970 tournament.I never saw such disappointment in a dressing room; several of my team-mates were crying and Adolfo Pedernera [Argentina's coach] was sat silently in a corner smoking,\" Argentine player Alberto Rendo, told FIFA.com.Boca Juniors' Bombonera stadium is the venue for  Argentina's game against Peru.Such is the magnitude of the upcoming fixture, Peru coach Ricardo Gareca has reportedly requested a police presence on the rooftops around his training camp to deter Argentine spies.\"I'd prefer to play World Cup Finals than deciders like the one against Peru,\" Argentina's general manager Jorge Burruchaga, who played in a World Cup qualifier against Peru in 1995, told FIFA.com.That game ended in a 2-2 draw with Argentina qualifying for Mexico 1986, while Peru went to the play-offs, where they lost to Chile.\"It was a very stressful occasion, whereas the finals I played in Mexico and Italy were very happy occasions because you knew you were close to achieving something great,\" added Burruchaga.READ: How football's culture club wins with the help of balletSuper Eagles soarNigeria remain on course to qualify for a third successive World Cup, a feat they have achieved only once before in their history.Currently sitting top of Group B, a home victory against nearest rivals Zambia -- who sit just three points behind -- would guarantee qualification to Russia 2018.JUST WATCHEDJay-Jay Okocha on PSG, Neymar and CavaniReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHJay-Jay Okocha on PSG, Neymar and Cavani 02:55In the same group, meanwhile, Algeria -- who impressed at the 2014 World Cup and almost knocked out eventual champions Germany -- are bottom with one point from four games, prompting fans to ask: how did it all go so wrong?In Group E, neutral's favorites Uganda are still in with a chance of qualifying for a first ever World Cup.

He concluded the address with a call for national unity, while continuing to unleash a verbal assault on the Catalan authorities.\"Today Spanish society is fractured and confronted. Those authorities have underestimated the fondness and feelings of solidarity that have united and will unite the whole of the Spanish population, and with their irresponsible attitude they have put the economic and social stability of Catalonia and Spain at risk,\" he said.On Tuesday night Catalonia's leader, Carles Puigdemont, told the BBC in an interview that his government would unilaterally declare independence by \"the end of this week or the beginning of next.\" If Puigdemont follows through on the promise in the interview, recorded before the king's address, it would further deepen the constitutional crisis facing Spain.Read MoreKing Felipe's decision to intervene in the crisis came after 700,000 people gathered in Barcelona, according to City Police, angered by the harsh treatment meted out by national forces who tried to prevent the banned vote from taking place. Many demonstrated in front of the Barcelona headquarters of the Spanish national police.JUST WATCHEDCatalonia: What you need to knowReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCatalonia: What you need to know 01:10Shops were closed, universities halted classes and transport companies ran reduced services as supporters of Catalonia's bid for independence from Spain attempted to maintain the momentum from Sunday's vote. Facing Spain's biggest political crisis in decades, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy held talks with opposition parties in Madrid. Spanish authorities have ordered members of the Guardia Civil, the national security force deployed to Catalonia to block the referendum, to remain on standby in the region for the next week.Protesters joined by firefighters raise their hands during the protest in Barcelona called by Catalan unions.'The streets will always be ours'Protesters gathering in Barcelona said they were motivated by fury at Sunday's violent crackdown -- the Catalan health ministry said 893 people were injured as riot police raided polling stations, dragged away voters and fired rubber bullets.\"This is a protest against police violence and maintaining momentum after Sunday,\" said Victor Noguer, 27, a firefighter.\"The streets will always be ours,\" protesters chanted, some of them draped in the blue, yellow and red Estelada flag used by Catalan separatists. Protesters wave a Catalan pro-independence 'Estelada' flag as they gather at the Placa de la Universitat square in Barcelona during a general strike in Catalonia called by Catalan unions on October 3, 2017.\nOfficers from the Guardia Civil and the Catalan police force stood guard outside the local headquarters of the Spanish government in Barcelona, where hundreds of firefighters gathered. Other groups of protesters gathered outside the headquarters of the national police, shouting \"Spanish police get out!\"In an interview with CNN at a police control center in the city, Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau condemned Rajoy's decision to deploy national security forces as \"seriously irresponsible.\" \"Why is he throwing thousands of police officers against the population,\" asked Colau, who does not support Catalan independence but was in favor of holding the referendum. \"Why is he keeping thousands of police officers on standby in the city of Barcelona and in Catalonia? What is the message of fear he wants to send?\"Protestors gather in front of the Spanish Partido Popular ruling party headquarters in Barcelona, Spain.The presence of the Spanish national police and the Guardia Civil in Catalonia is a source of increasing tension in the city following Sunday's violence. Animosity is also rising between local and national forces. On Tuesday, the Guardia Civil police union, the AUGC, filed a complaint with the Catalan High Court against the Catalan police, or Mossos d'Esquadra, complaining that they failed in their duties by not enforcing the court ruling that banned the referendum. The AUGC also filed a complaint in connection with the eviction of 200 officers from the Hotel Vila in the Calella district of Barcelona. It called for a judicial inquiry into reports the mayor threatened to withdraw the hotel's license if the Guardia Civil remained there. Spanish newspaper El Pais said two hotels in Barcelona and hotels in Reus, 100 kilometers from the city, have ordered Guardia Civil officers to leave following Sunday's referendum. Spain's Interior Minister, Juan Ignacio Zoido, said Madrid would \"take all necessary measures\" to stop the \"intolerable harassment\" of national security forces.The Catalan government says it earned the right to split from Spain, claiming 90% of those who voted in Sunday's poll were in favour of independence. But the result was not decisive: turnout was low, at around 42%. Catalan independence vote caps four centuries of mistrustCatalan authorities blamed the crackdown for the low turnout, but it remains clear that public opinion in Catalonia is deeply split on independence. Catalonia's President Carles Puigdemont stopped short of declaring independence for Catalonia Monday. According to the referendum law passed by the Catalan Parliament -- and declared illegal by Spain's top court -- authorities have 48 hours after the result to declare a split. Catalan authorities have not yet presented a final result to the Parliament in Barcelona.Puigdemont has called for international mediation to resolve the crisis.Spanish PM unrepentantOn Monday, an unrepentant Prime Minister Rajoy met Spanish opposition leaders to discuss the government's next moves.A statement released Monday night by the Spanish government described Sunday's events as a \"serious situation of institutional disobedience in this community.\"Protestors throw referendum ballots as they rally in front of Spain's ruling Partido Popular  headquarters in Barcelona.It said that during his meetings the Prime Minister \"has strongly defended the actions of the security forces during [Sunday's] events and has reiterated that more than 400 officers needed (medical) attention and 40 needed emergency attention because of their injuries.\" Rajoy's office said Tuesday that he was considering calling a special session of Spain's Congress of Deputies to discuss the crisis.So far, European Union leaders and the European Commission have backed the Spanish government's opinion that the referendum was illegal.The European Parliament, the EU's only elected body, will discuss the crisis on Wednesday. The Catalan cause is likely to find more sympathizers there, especially from the smaller nations.  The UN Commissioner for Human Rights has asked to be allowed to send in experts to examine if citizens' rights have been violated.

        "content": "(CNN)Germany's president Frank-Walter Steinmeier has warned of the fractures in its society -- highlighted by the electoral success of the far-right party Alternative for Germany (AfD) -- on the nation's Day of German Unity.On October 3, a national holiday, Germans mark the reunification of East and West Germany in 1990, following the fall of the Berlin Wall the previous year.\"It is right that we celebrate this day, like every year,\" Steinmeier told a large gathering of politicians and citizens in Mainz, western Germany. \"But something is different this year ... we must not go on as if nothing has happened.\"We can say goodbye to a stable Germany\"Other walls have gone up,\" he said, \"less visible and without barbed wire and death strips, but still walls that stand in the way of our collective 'we.'\"Steinmeier spoke of walls between cities and rural areas, between rich and poor, old and young, and online and offline communities.  Read MoreThey are \"walls of alienation, frustration or anger\" and behind those walls there is \"deep mistrust of democracy and its representatives,\" Steinmeier said.Without mentioning the AfD by name, Steinmeier warned that Germany's progress since 1990, becoming a democratic, peaceful and strong country at the heart of Europe, could be lost if politicians and ordinary Germans do not work together to fight the party's far-right ideology and to respond to the concerns of its supporters.The appeal of the far rightThe AfD -- originally an anti-European Union and anti-euro party that has since turned its focus to immigration and Islam -- won 12.6% of the vote in the elections on September 24 and became the third largest party in the German parliament, according to preliminary results.Like many other far-right parties across Europe, the AfD has branded itself as an anti-establishment party of protest, appealing to those citizens previously disillusioned by or uninterested in politics.And their strategy seemed to work: nearly 700,000 votes for the AfD came from former non-voters, according to preliminary data from political polling firm Infratest Dimap.Germans celebrate the \"Day of German Unity\" at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. The monument stood in no-man's land, between East and West Berlin, until 1989.Support for the AfD was particularly high in the former East Germany, where 21.5% of votes went to the far-right party, according to Infratest Dimap.Speaking to CNN on the night of the election results, Jasna Zajcek, an expert on rise of the far right in eastern Germany, said one of the reasons the AfD had performed better than expected was that many voters in the east do not feel integrated into modern Germany.She said these voters feel they still suffer from the loss of the more socialist state system that the former East Germany once provided.Those voters don't understand why economic benefits are \"thrown\" at migrants while they suffer from high unemployment, small pensions and drug and alcohol problems, Zajcek added.Concessions on immigration?Steinmeier addressed this issue in his speech Tuesday, saying many Germans from the former East no longer feel at home in their own country, and question if anyone is looking out for them.Four graphics that explain how a far-right party won third place in Germany\"This desire for a home, a homeland -- we mustn't leave that to the nationalists,\" said Steinmeier. \"There must never be a route back to nationalism,\" he insisted, a statement that was met with a sustained ovation.  Steinmeier did, however, suggest Germany should consider stricter immigration controls in what can be seen as a bid to draw AfD voters back to the mainstream parties. Germany should give asylum to those who are eligible, he said, but must also consider \"which forms of and how much immigration we want ... and need.\"\"Migration should be controlled according to our requirements,\" he continued, insisting that people who come to Germany must learn the language and abide by the country's laws and values. \"That cannot be up for discussion.\"CNN's Lauren Said-Moorhouse contributed to this article.",

Led by Vince Pankoke, who formerly worked with the FBI to track Colombian drug cartels, the project will use cold case investigative techniques and data analysis software developed in the last decade to unravel one of history's greatest mysteries: Who betrayed Anne Frank?The German teenager was best known for her diary documenting her time in the \"Secret Annex,\" a hidden enclave at the back of her father Otto Frank's former office, at 263 Prinsengracht in the Dutch capital. The Franks and another Jewish family spent more than two years in hiding before they were discovered by the Gestapo, the German secret police, in August 1944 and sent off to concentration camps.

Her diary is often many young people's introduction to the horrors of the Holocaust.Hide Caption 8 of 8Anne's diary, nicknamed \"Kitty,\" provided a moving and in-depth documentation of the rise of anti-Semitic laws in Netherlands as well as the pangs of spending an adolescence in captivity. She died shortly before the end of  World War II at the age of 15 in a concentration camp in Bergen-Belsen, Germany. She was survived by Otto, who returned to publish her diary in 1947. In the aftermath of the war, Dutch police launched probes into the betrayal of the Frank family at the insistence of Otto Frank, who suspected a warehouse worker of having disclosed their location, but the investigations were inconclusive.Read MoreLast year, research conducted by the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam suggested that the location of the secret annex could have been uncovered by the Gestapo by accident, and not as part of a mission to find and arrest its residents based on a tip-off from an informant, as previously thought. Anne Frank's arrest might not have stemmed from betrayalThis new investigation, however, will reconstruct the events prior to the discovery and look at all 30 suspects who have been accused over time of betraying the Frank family, hoping to solve the mystery that has puzzled historians. The data generated from Frank's diary and the archives available from that period will be scanned by specialist software to narrow down the suspects. The multidisciplinary investigative team of 20 includes detectives, data analysts, profilers, historians and criminologists. The experts are also seeking tips from members of the public and using actors to reenact witness and suspect statements obtained in the past.The Anne Frank House has opened its doors and archives to the \"Cold Case Diary\" project, which is being filmed and is relying on crowd-funding to pay for its investigation. \"Every school aged-child knows about Anne Frank and so did I. I remember that once in 2005, I was in Amsterdam on a mission, and my Dutch colleague drove me through Amsterdam. While passing the Anne Frank House he told me that this case has never been solved. That surprised me,\" Pankoke said in a statement provided to CNN by Proditione Media, the production company behind the project. \"I must say that I always had a keen interest since my father and his two brothers fought in WW2,\" Pankoke added. \"My father once told me that his unit liberated a concentration camp near Mittenwald and he never could forget the sight of this place and its prisoners.\"  Rare handwritten Anne Frank poem smashes auction estimateXomnia, an Amsterdam-based software company specializing in Artificial Intelligence (AI), will be providing the software for processing data from various archives. \"There is simply far too much data available nowadays for a human brain to analyze,\" a spokesperson for Xomnia said in a statement provided by Proditione Media. \"Our software allows [researchers] to search the data and visualize it new ways. This has already led to a few new traces.\"\"The Anne Frank House's new investigation [in 2016] does not refute the possibility that the people in hiding were betrayed, but illustrates that other scenarios should also be considered,\" Ronald Leopold, executive director of the Anne Frank House, said in a statement to CNN. \"We are pleased that 'Cold Case Diary' is also carrying out research into the arrest and following new leads, and we are interested to see the results.\"Pankoke, who was awarded a medal by the Colombian government for his success in tracking drug cartels, will be detailing the progress of the investigation online. He hopes to unveil the project's findings on the 75th anniversary of the discovery of the Frank family in hiding, on August 4, 2019. \"Considering the amount of data to review, normally I would be pessimistic, but now with these great experts in the team and the AI component, I am really optimistic,\" he said. \"To choose that specific date feels like honoring the victims. But of course, in no way will we let the deadline jeopardize the integrity of the research.\"",

The Catalan health ministry said 893 people were injured in the clashes Sunday as riot police raided polling stations, dragged away voters and fired rubber bullets.The Catalan President Carles Puigdemont denounced the police crackdown as the worst violence Catalonia had seen since the military dictatorship of Francisco Franco, and demanded the withdrawal of Spanish national forces from the region.People help a man injured by a rubber bullet fired by Spanish police officers outside the Ramon Llull polling station in Barcelona.The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, called for \"independent and impartial investigations into all acts of violence\" around the independence referendum, and asked the Spanish government to allow UN human rights experts to visit.Read More\"Police responses must at all times be proportionate and necessary,\" he said in a statement. \"I firmly believe that the current situation should be resolved through political dialogue, with full respect for democratic freedoms,\" he added.Trade unions in Catalonia called a strike and a mass demonstration for Tuesday, an action likely to test public support for the Catalan government in the aftermath of Sunday's chaos. The Spanish government of Mariano Rajoy said it was discussing its response with opposition parties in Madrid.'No traumatic break'All eyes were on the Catalan government as it considered its next move. Under the referendum legislation passed by the Catalan parliament, the regional government has 48 hours after the result is finalized to declare independence from Spain. Final votes were still being counted Monday.JUST WATCHEDHundreds injured in Spain after referendumReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHundreds injured in Spain after referendum 01:05The Catalan President stopped short of declaring independence from Spain Monday -- a move that would further deepen the crisis. But Puigdemont called for an international arbiter to mediate the crisis, ideally the European Union. \"This moment needs mediation,\" he said. \"We only received violence and repression as an answer.\"Puigdemont said Catalonia did not want a \"traumatic break\" with Madrid. \"We want a new understanding with the Spanish state,\" he said.If the Catalan government unilaterally declared independence from Spain, Rajoy could suspend the President and take over the running of the province. Such a move would inflame tensions considerably and would likely be a last resort for Rajoy. Several thousand people gathered outside Barcelona's town hall Tuesday morning where the executive of the autonomous Catalan government was meeting.People shouted \"Long live free Catalonia, we are peaceful people and we only want to vote.\" Photos: Divisions in Spain over Catalonia crisis Protesters march through Barcelona during a demonstration to support the unity of Spain on October 8.

Violence or democracy, this is our demand,\" the Catalan Minister of Foreign Affairs Ra\u00fcl Romeva said. But the EU backed Madrid. The European Commission, the European Unions's executive body, said the vote was illegal. \"We call on all relevant players to now move very swiftly from confrontation to dialogue. Violence can never be an instrument in politics,\" the commission said in a statement posted on Twitter.  It said it trusted Rajoy \"to manage difficult process\" in respect of the Spanish constitution.Rajoy has said the vote was illegitimate. \"At this point, I can tell you very clearly: Today a self-determination referendum in Catalonia didn't happen,\" he said in a televised speech Sunday night.Majority votes for split Of 2.2 million ballots counted, about 90% were in favor of independence, Catalan government spokesman Jordi Turull told a news conference shortly after midnight. Turnout was about 42% of the 5.3 million eligible voters, authorities said later Monday.Turull said more people would have voted had it not been for the Spanish police suppression. Up to 770,000 votes were lost as a result of the crackdowns at polling stations, the Catalan government estimated.Spain's national government in Madrid has ardently resisted separation. In the runup to the vote, national authorities seized ballot papers, voter lists and campaign material. Thousands of extra national police were sent to the region and high-ranking Catalan officials involved in organizing the referendum were arrested.Women walk in the old quarter of Girona, Spain, draped in Catalonia's independence flag.Regional officials said 400 polling stations were closed as a result of the police crackdown. The Spanish Interior Ministry said 92 of about 2,300 polling stations were closed.Pablo Guillen Alvarez, an economist and \u200eassociate professor at the University of Sydney, told CNN that the violent scenes could lead to more support for Catalan independence.While sympathy in the press and on social media lies with the Catalans, hard-right supporters of the Spanish government put Madrid under a lot of pressure to show strength, he said. \"The Catalan question has been boiling for 150-200 years. It's a no-go, red line for the Spanish right.\"(The government) reacted in only way that they could have.\"International responseThe UK's Foreign Ministry said the referendum was a matter for the Spanish government and its people.\"We want to see Spanish law and the Spanish constitution respected and the rule of law upheld. Spain is a close ally and a good friend, whose strength and unity matters to us,\" it said in a statement.

What happened?More than 2.25 million people turned out to Sunday's referendum across Catalonia, a region in the northeast of Spain. The regional government said 90% of voters were in favor of a split from Madrid.JUST WATCHEDCatalans vote to split from SpainReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCatalans vote to split from Spain 02:22But the turnout was low -- around 42% of the voter roll. Catalan authorities blamed the figure on the crackdown on the vote initiated by the national government.Read MoreSpain's highest court had ruled the vote illegal under the Spanish constitution. Citing the judicial authority, Madrid flooded Catalonia with thousands of national police in advance of the vote. Officers seized millions of ballot papers and sealed schools and other buildings to be used as polling stations.On Sunday, the day of the disputed vote, national police launched a concerted effort to prevent people from casting their ballots. Police fired rubber bullets at protesters and voters trying to take part in the referendum, and used batons to beat them back. People help a man injured by a rubber bullet fired by Spanish police officers outside the Ramon Llull polling station in Barcelona.Police smashed their way into polling stations, and were seen pulling voters out by the hair and restraining elderly people. The scenes shocked Catalans and reverberated around Europe.Almost 900 people were injured, Catalan officials said. Opposition parties criticized Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy for taking a heavy-handed approach to blocking the vote. Why did it happen?The long-running dispute goes back to the brutal years under Franco, whose dictatorial regime repressed Catalonia's earlier limited autonomy. In 1979, four years after his death, the region was granted greater autonomy.In 2006, the Spanish government backed Catalonia's calls for even greater powers and financial control of the region, granting it \"nation\" status.

Catalonia is the wealthiest region in Spain and is industrially more advanced than the rest of the country.READ: Spain loses 20% of its economy if Catalonia splitsThe region held a symbolic poll in 2014, in which 80% of voters backed complete secession -- but only 32% of the electorate turned out.Was the vote legitimate?Madrid insists the vote was illegal. Prime Minister Rajoy said on Sunday that it \"didn't happen.\" JUST WATCHEDPolice clash with Catalonia referendum votersReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPolice clash with Catalonia referendum voters 02:35The national government argues that Spain's Constitution, revised in 1978, says that all Spaniards have the right to vote in referenda on major issues, so any vote on secession must be put to all Spaniards. Less than half of the regions 5 million voters appear to have taken part in the referendum.The European Commission wrote on Twitter that the vote was not legal.There are several other complications with the vote. Because Madrid declared the vote illegal, many Catalans who might have turned out to an independence referendum chose not to. Images of the use of force by police also suggest that many voters were physically prevented from casting their ballots, or felt intimated to do so.What's next?The world is now waiting to see if Catalan officials will unilaterally declare independence. Authorities had earlier threatened to make the declaration within 48 hours of the vote if secession won.But on Monday, the Catalan President stopped short of such a declaration, calling for international mediation instead.Madrid has the option of seizing control of Catalonia's administration by triggering article 155 of the Constitution. It could use this time to call a snap election and negotiate with new Catalan leaders. But this is a major risk for the Spanish government. Like the use of force on Sunday, such a measure would likely fuel resentment for Madrid among Catalan independence supporters and create more political turmoil.There is more at stake for Madrid than losing its wealthiest region. The country has 17 regions with varying degrees of autonomy, and losing one may inspire other regions to begin, or revive, separatist movements.CNN's Angela Dewan and Hilary Clarke reported from London.

        "content": "Story highlightsThree Dolphin players kneel Saints players stand for National Anthem Wembley, London (CNN)There was defiance again, but this time it wasn't as raw. Once more, all eyes were on the sidelines for the second Sunday in the NFL following US President Donald Trump's remarks about players protesting during the US National Anthem. In the latest round of matches 52 players chose to sit or kneel during the Anthem -- 30 of them from the San Francisco 49ers -- compared to the 180 who took the knee last week. Follow @cnnsport\n\nAt London's Wembley Stadium, three Miami Dolphins players -- Kenny Stills, Julius Thomas and Michael Thomas -- knelt, while the New Orleans Saints' squad knelt and locked arms during the coin toss before standing for the anthem. On the eve of the 14 Sunday matches, President Trump had urged all NFL players to stand for the National Anthem. Read More\"Very important that NFL players STAND tomorrow, and always, for the playing of our National Anthem,\" Trump posted. \"Respect our Flag and our Country!\" 'Everybody vs. Trump'However, the show of defiance continued -- in London and on football fields in the US.Buffalo Bills players kneel during the National Anthem before their match against Atlanta Falcons at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars knelt before \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was played -- sections of fans booed both teams -- while two members of the Detroit Lions and six members of the Buffalo Bills knelt during the anthem.Oakland Raiders' Marshawn Lynch wore a t-shirt with \"Everybody vs. Trump\" printed on the front as he entered the Sports Authority Field and, as he did last week, sat during the anthem while his teammates, who mostly knelt or sat last week, stood. Ravens' opponents, the Denver Broncos, all stood but Brandon Marshall, who joined Colin Kaepernick in kneeling last season, raised a fist, as did Malcolm Jenkins and Rodney McLeod of the Philadelphia Eagles, reminiscent to John Carlos and Tommie Smith's Black Power salute at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics.  Steve Longa of the Detroit Lions takes a knee with teammate Jalen Reeves-Maybin during the national anthem before the game against the Minnesota Vikings.READ: NFL star defends right to protest READ: Americans split on anthem protests 'Kaepernick's reason has got lost'Lynch's t-shirt highlighted the divisive nature of Trump's comments. His speech in Alabama, on September 27, which called on NFL owners to fire players for taking a knee during the anthem, sparked an unprecedented wave of protest in the country's most popular sports league as more than 200 NFL players knelt, sat or prayed during the anthem last Sunday. JUST WATCHEDOlympian slams Trump's NFL criticism ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHOlympian slams Trump's NFL criticism  03:24According to a CNN poll conducted by SSRS last week, the majority of Americans agreed that Trump did the wrong thing by criticizing players, but people were sharply divided over whether NFL stars were doing the right thing.Feelings were certainly mixed as fans made their way to Wembley for a match which ended in a dominant 20-0 win for the Saints over the Dolphins. Lee Collins, from Georgia, said the meaning of the protests -- which began last year when then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" in protest of racial and social injustice -- had been lost. \"I think the initial reason for kneeling, I understand that,\" the 35-year-old Collins told CNN Sport.\"But the NFL as a whole, someone's ego got hurt and Kaepernick's reason has got lost. I believe in why Kaepernick is doing it but not why the NFL is doing it.\"READ: 'I think they're afraid of their players'Miami Dolphins players kneel down during the national anthem before the NFL game against New Orleans Saints.'It's about the injustices happening to my people'After the match, Saints running back Adrian Peterson said those who did not understand the reasons for taking the knee were \"part of the problem.\"\"If fans can listen to the words that are coming out of my mouth, to understand that it's not about disrespecting our military, it's about the injustice that's happening to my people,\" he told CNN. Peterson defended the right the take a knee\"People are being killed by officers and nobody is paying the cost for those actions. No one. If we stand for something then we need to stand for liberty and justice for all and that's not happening right now in the US. \"So if people can get past the disrespect they feel is going towards the military and really see and feel and talk about the main issue, then I feel like some type of change can come but until then I feel like it's undermining the true cause. \"We all have family members who have served in the military, they would have taken the knee if they had seen where our country was -- liberty and justice for all, that's what they fought for, and liberty and justice for all is not being applied in the US, that's what people need to be upset about, they need to see that justice is not being applied to people of color and if you can't see that, you are part of the problem.\" Photos: American football's big earnersThough Aaron Rodgers (left) and Tom Brady are arguably the two best quarterbacks in the NFL, both are outside the elite level of earners this season. Here are the top 20 highest-paid NFL players for 2017, based on average yearly salaries in their contracts. (Source: NFL.com)Hide Caption 1 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 19 (tie): Sam Bradford, $18 million \u2013 After six mostly disappointing seasons in St Louis and Philadelphia, the first overall pick of the 2010 draft has finally found a home. Although Minnesota did not qualify for the playoffs with an 8-8 record, Sam Bradford was mostly error-free, throwing 20 touchdowns and just five interceptions on his way to an excellent 99 passer rating in 2016. Hide Caption 2 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 19 (tie): Brock Osweiler, $18 million \u2013 Brock Osweiler has endured a bumpy road on his way back to Denver. Peyton Manning's former understudy experienced a difficult 2016 spell at Texas (15 TDs, 16 INTs) before being traded to Cleveland and subsequently released. The former Arizona State standout was 5-2 as a starter in Denver filling in for Manning, and Broncos fans hope he can restore some of that magic this season. Hide Caption 3 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 18: Ndamukong Suh, $19.1 million \u2013 Ndamukong Suh was signed by the Miami Dolphins for a six-year, $114 million contract in March 2015, making him the highest paid defensive player in history at the time -- hefty numbers for a 30-year-old lineman who has yet to match the 10 sacks achieved during his rookie season with the Detroit Lions. Hide Caption 4 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 17: Von Miller, $19.1 million \u2013 The MVP of Super Bowl 50 for the Denver Broncos single-handedly badgered Panthers quarterback Cam Newton into submission, with 6 tackles, 2.5 sacks, 2 forced fumbles and 2 quarterback hurries in the title game. Von Miller promptly signed a $114.5 million deal ($70 million guaranteed) with the Broncos, making him the richest defensive player in NFL history. Hide Caption 5 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 16: Ryan Tannehill, $19.25 million \u2013 Though Ryan Tannehill (#17) has shown promise in his five seasons in the league, he suffered a season-ending knee injury in the pre-season. A former part-time receiver in college at Texas A&M, Tannehill has been one of the speediest quarterbacks in the league -- a quality which will be tested after knee surgery. In a 44-26 win against Houston in 2015, Tannehill became the 64th quarterback in NFL history to record a perfect passer rating, throwing four TDs, with 18 completions in 19 attempts. Hide Caption 6 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 15: Tom Brady, $20.5 million \u2013 With five Super Bowl rings, 12 Pro Bowls, four Super Bowl MVP award and two NFL MVP awards, tom Brady is the one player in the list who can claim to be underpaid. At 40, he's on the back end of a two-year, $41 million contract, but has left money on the table in previous negotiations to sign better players around him -- a plan that has yielded a record seven Super Bowl appearances and counting.  Hide Caption 7 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 14: Matt Ryan, $20.75 million \u2013 \"Matty Ice\" will attempt to re-earn his nickname, after suffering perhaps the most remarkable blown lead in sporting history at Super Bowl 51. Up 28-9 going into the fourth quarter, the Falcons handed 25 straight points to New England, with Matt Ryan giving up a crucial fumble and sack in the process. The former Boston College standout and four-time Pro Bowler was inserted as the Atlanta Falcons' starter since being drafted third overall in 2008. Hide Caption 8 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 13: Cam Newton, $20.76 million \u2013 Cam Newton is arguably the most complete player on this list. At 6 foot 6 inches and 260 pounds, he has the size, speed and athleticism -- along with stellar QB instincts -- to take the Carolina Panthers into the playoffs every year. But after a disastrous 2016 season, in which the Panthers went 6-10, \"Killer Cam\" will again trying to erase his unfortunate Super Bowl 50 performance (0 touchdowns, one interception, sacked six times, two fumble losses). Hide Caption 9 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 12: Philip Rivers, $20.81 million \u2013 In his 13-year pro career, Philip Rivers has yet to appear in a Super Bowl, although he has taken the San Diego Chargers into the playoffs five times. The father of eight children has broken most of the major franchise records, surpassing Dan Fouts as the Chargers' all-time touchdown leader, wins leader and consecutive starts leader (185 and counting). In 2014, Rivers broke an NFL record by achieving five consecutive games with a passer rating of above 120. Hide Caption 10 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 11: Eli Manning, $21 million \u2013 The two-time Super Bowl MVP led the Giants back into the playoffs last season, only to lose at Green Bay. At times Eli Manning has befuddled New Yorkers with error-prone performances, but his legacy is cemented in New York sporting lore. His active 211-game playing streak is third all-time for QBs. Hide Caption 11 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 10:  Ben Roethlisberger, $21.85 million  \u2013 Though \"Big Ben\" (#7) has flirted with the idea of retirement, the two-time Super Bowl champion shows no sign of slowing down. Shaking off some niggling injuries, Ben Roethlisberger had an excellent 2016 campaign, earning his fifth Pro Bowl selection before taking his Steelers to the AFC Conference Finals. Hide Caption 12 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 9: Russell Wilson, $21.9 million  \u2013 It's ironic that Russell Wilson threw the most famous interception in NFL history -- the last-minute gaff which cost the Seattle Seahawks the 2015 Super Bowl -- because the 28-year-old three-time Pro Bowler plays virtually error-free. Though standing at just 5 foot 11 inches, Wilson was the top-rated NFL quarterback in 2015, and is second all-time, trailing only Aaron Rodgers.  Hide Caption 13 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 8:  Aaron Rodgers, $22 million \u2013 That Aaron Rodgers holds the top career passer rating record while playing in frozen Lambeau Field is a testament to his talent. Rodgers led the Green Bay Packers to a 2011 championship, and is riding an eight-year playoff streak into 2017. But despite posting stellar regular-season numbers in the six seasons since the Super Bowl (a mind-boggling 219 TDs and just 41 INTs) the Packers have come up short in the playoffs. Hide Caption 14 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 7: Joe Flacco, $22.13 million \u2013 When the Baltimore Ravens offered a three-year, $66.4 million ($44 million guaranteed) deal to Joe Flacco in 2016, it seemed like an aberration. In his 10 seasons, the 32-year-old has yet to make a Pro Bowl. But traditionally the Ravens have thrived on defense, and until Flacco came along in 2008, the team won in spite of its sputtering quarterbacks. The 2013 Super Bowl MVP brings a calm presence to a team which suffered a leadership vacuum after the retirements of Ed Reed and Ray Lewis.   Hide Caption 15 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 6: Kirk Cousins, $23.9 million \u2013 \"You like that?\" Kirk Cousins, who led Washington to the playoffs in 2015 behind that rallying cry, signed his second consecutive one-year deal in the off-season. Unable to come to a long-term deal with the Redskins, the 29-year-old settled for one year and nearly $24 million. Hide Caption 16 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 5: Drew Brees, $24.3 million \u2013 It's hard to overestimate Drew Brees' value to the city of New Orleans. When the former Charger joined the Saints in 2006, the year after Hurricane Katrina, the team was 3-13. Four years later, New Orleans won its first and only Super Bowl. The 10-time Pro Bowler holds team passing records in every major category.  He has also been a face of the community, raising funds for cancer research and other charitable causes. Hide Caption 17 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 4: Carson Palmer, $24.4 million \u2013 Carson Palmer, a three-time Pro Bowl selection, is entering his 14th NFL season. The 37-year-old signed a one-year deal with Arizona in the off season. Hide Caption 18 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 3:  Andrew Luck, $24.6 million \u2013 Andrew Luck -- whose $140 million, six-year deal is still the highest contract total in history -- bounced back from an injury-riddled  2015 to post 31 TDs and just 13 interceptions last season. His off-season shoulder surgery, however, sidelines him for the start of the 2017 campaign. Hide Caption 19 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 2: Derek Carr, $25 million \u2013 The Oakland Raiders made Derek Carr their franchise QB this offseason with a five-year, $125 million deal -- briefly crowning the former Fresno State man as the highest paid player in the league. Carr has been a Pro-Bowler two of his first three seasons in Oakland. Hide Caption 20 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 1: Matthew Stafford, $27 million \u2013 Weeks before the start of the 2017 campaign, Detroit made Stafford the highest-paid player in NFL history with a five year, $135 million deal. Though he is yet to win a playoff game, Stafford is the Lions' all-time leader in passing yards and touchdowns. The nine-year veteran's 99-game starting streak is 11th best of all time. Hide Caption 21 of 21Asked about his team's pre-game decision to kneel before the anthem and then stand, Saints head coach Sean Payton told reporters he was \"proud of the leadership on the team.\"He added: \"We just felt like they were going to meet and spend some time on it and come up with a plan, and we were going to be really unified, and I thought it went real well.\"",

            "No. 14: Matt Ryan, $20.75 million \u2014 \"Matty Ice\" will attempt to re-earn his nickname, after suffering perhaps the most remarkable blown lead in sporting history at Super Bowl 51 . Up 28-9 going into the fourth quarter, the Falcons handed 25 straight points to New England, with Matt Ryan giving up a crucial fumble and sack in the process. The former Boston College standout and four-time Pro Bowler was inserted as the Atlanta Falcons' starter since being drafted third overall in 2008.",
            "No. 13: Cam Newton, $20.76 million \u2014 Cam Newton is arguably the most complete player on this list. At 6 foot 6 inches and 260 pounds, he has the size, speed and athleticism -- along with stellar QB instincts -- to take the Carolina Panthers into the playoffs every year. But after a disastrous 2016 season, in which the Panthers went 6-10, \"Killer Cam\" will again trying to erase his unfortunate Super Bowl 50 performance (0 touchdowns, one interception, sacked six times, two fumble losses).",
            "No. 12: Philip Rivers, $20.81 million \u2014 In his 13-year pro career, Philip Rivers has yet to appear in a Super Bowl, although he has taken the San Diego Chargers into the playoffs five times. The father of eight children has broken most of the major franchise records, surpassing Dan Fouts as the Chargers' all-time touchdown leader, wins leader and consecutive starts leader (185 and counting). In 2014, Rivers broke an NFL record by achieving five consecutive games with a passer rating of above 120.",
            "No. 11: Eli Manning, $21 million \u2014 The two-time Super Bowl MVP led the Giants back into the playoffs last season, only to lose at Green Bay. At times Eli Manning has befuddled New Yorkers with error-prone performances, but his legacy is cemented in New York sporting lore. His active 211-game playing streak is third all-time for QBs.",
            "No. 10:  Ben Roethlisberger, $21.85 million \u2014 Though \"Big Ben\" (#7) has flirted with the idea of retirement, the two-time Super Bowl champion shows no sign of slowing down. Shaking off some niggling injuries, Ben Roethlisberger had an excellent 2016 campaign, earning his fifth Pro Bowl selection before taking his Steelers to the AFC Conference Finals.",
            "No. 9: Russell Wilson, $21.9 million \u2014 It's ironic that Russell Wilson threw the most famous interception in NFL history -- the last-minute gaff which cost the Seattle Seahawks the 2015 Super Bowl -- because the 28-year-old three-time Pro Bowler plays virtually error-free. Though standing at just 5 foot 11 inches, Wilson was the top-rated NFL quarterback in 2015, and is second all-time, trailing only Aaron Rodgers.",
            "No. 8:  Aaron Rodgers, $22 million \u2014 That Aaron Rodgers holds the top career passer rating record while playing in frozen Lambeau Field is a testament to his talent. Rodgers led the Green Bay Packers to a 2011 championship, and is riding an eight-year playoff streak into 2017. But despite posting stellar regular-season numbers in the six seasons since the Super Bowl (a mind-boggling 219 TDs and just 41 INTs) the Packers have come up short in the playoffs.",
            "No. 7: Joe Flacco, $22.13 million \u2014 When the Baltimore Ravens offered a three-year, $66.4 million ($44 million guaranteed) deal to Joe Flacco in 2016, it seemed like an aberration. In his 10 seasons, the 32-year-old has yet to make a Pro Bowl. But traditionally the Ravens have thrived on defense, and until Flacco came along in 2008, the team won in spite of its sputtering quarterbacks. The 2013 Super Bowl MVP brings a calm presence to a team which suffered a leadership vacuum after the retirements of Ed Reed and Ray Lewis.",
            "No. 6: Kirk Cousins, $23.9 million \u2014 \"You like that?\" Kirk Cousins, who led Washington to the playoffs in 2015 behind that rallying cry, signed his second consecutive one-year deal in the off-season. Unable to come to a long-term deal with the Redskins, the 29-year-old settled for one year and nearly $24 million.",
            "No. 5: Drew Brees, $24.3 million \u2014 It's hard to overestimate Drew Brees' value to the city of New Orleans. When the former Charger joined the Saints in 2006, the year after Hurricane Katrina, the team was 3-13. Four years later, New Orleans won its first and only Super Bowl. The 10-time Pro Bowler holds team passing records in every major category.  He has also been a face of the community, raising funds for cancer research and other charitable causes.",
            "No. 4: Carson Palmer, $24.4 million \u2014 Carson Palmer, a three-time Pro Bowl selection, is entering his 14th NFL season. The 37-year-old signed a one-year deal with Arizona in the off season.",
            "No. 3:  Andrew Luck, $24.6 million \u2014 Andrew Luck -- whose $140 million, six-year deal is still the highest contract total in history -- bounced back from an injury-riddled  2015 to post 31 TDs and just 13 interceptions last season. His off-season shoulder surgery, however, sidelines him for the start of the 2017 campaign.",
            "No. 2: Derek Carr, $25 million \u2014 The Oakland Raiders made Derek Carr their franchise QB this offseason with a five-year, $125 million deal -- briefly crowning the former Fresno State man as the highest paid player in the league. Carr has been a Pro-Bowler two of his first three seasons in Oakland.",
            "No. 1: Matthew Stafford, $27 million \u2014 Weeks before the start of the 2017 campaign, Detroit made Stafford the highest-paid player in NFL history with a five year, $135 million deal. Though he is yet to win a playoff game, Stafford is the Lions' all-time leader in passing yards and touchdowns. The nine-year veteran's 99-game starting streak is 11th best of all time."

        "content": "(CNN)The tensions laid bare between Catalonia and Spain's federal government over Sunday's referendum have a long and painful history that reaches back to the Franco era and beyond. But never since Spain became a democracy have relations been this polarized, the language so inflammatory. On Sunday night, the Spanish Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy, accused Catalan secessionists of \"indoctrinating children, harassing judges and journalists.\" Barcelona's mayor tweeted that \"a cowardly president filled our city with police.\"JUST WATCHEDPolice clash with Catalonia referendum votersReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPolice clash with Catalonia referendum voters 02:35While Catalans were occupying schools to ensure they could open as polling stations, Spanish flags were suddenly hanging from balconies in faraway Andalucia. Jose Luis Nantunez, a retired jeweler in Cordoba, told CNN that the Catalans were \"rancourous traitors, indoctrinated at an early age to become nationalists.\"The brief moment of solidarity after the August terror attack in Barcelona, when King Felipe and Rajoy were applauded at a memorial in the Plaza Catalunya, seems a long time ago.Even then, the sniping resumed within days, with Catalan police complaining that Madrid had deprived them of intelligence from Europol, the pan-European law enforcement agency. The Spanish Interior Minister, Juan Ignacio Zoido, said that such information could only be shared \"in an atmosphere of agreement and trust.\"Read MoreCenturies of mistrustPeople hold Catalan flags as they listen to Catalan President Carles Puigdemont speak as they await the referendum result.Trust has often been in short supply since King Felipe V's army captured Barcelona in 1714, an event still remembered every September 11, Catalonia's national day. As Barcelona became Spain's industrial powerhouse in the early 20th century, separatist sentiment stirred again. It contributed to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War; General Francisco Franco's planes bombed Barcelona in 1938 and his forces took the city early in 1939. Barcelona began removing the last plaques from the Franco era this year; street names recalling his rule were changed long ago. But nearly four decades of military dictatorship still provoke a visceral reaction among older Catalans.Hundreds injured as Spain cracks down on Catalan referendumFranco banned the use of the Catalan language in public -- yet today it's spoken by at least four million people, and taught as the primary language in every school. Culturally, economically and not least on the football field, Catalans see themselves as a distinct nation. The yellow-and-red striped flag is everywhere. The seeds of the current crisis were perhaps sown when Spain adopted a democratic constitution in 1978. It devolved powers to the regions precisely as an insurance against a repeat of Franco's overweening central power, while stressing the \"indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation.\" But Catalan governments always wanted more, and support for outright independence reached a peak during the country's economic crisis from 2008 to 2012. Independence supporters gather in Barcelona's main square on Sunday.Catalonia is the economic engine of Spain; its economy is the size of Portugal's. For years it has complained that its revenues are \"plundered: by Madrid -- that it pays in some $12 billion more than it receives. Madrid says the gap is much smaller -- a view supported by most economic analysis. Charles Powell, history professor at the Universidad CEU-San Pablo, says the Catalan calculation is \"nonsense\" but the region receives less investment than its size would warrant.Catalan self-confidenceSome 20 years ago, I spoke with the then mayor of Barcelona, Pasqual Maragall. The city was basking in the glow of a successful Olympic Games, for which it had transformed much of Barcelona's infrastructure. I asked him how relations were with Madrid. There was a shrug. Barcelona saw itself more as a European city, he said. His reply was a measure of Catalonia's emerging self-confidence. In an era when nationalist movements -- from Scotland to the Baltics and Belgium -- were finding their voice, Catalan politicians felt the tide of history was flowing in their favor.  Barcelona's cosmopolitan self-assurance is often seen elsewhere as arrogance. Powell says that many other Spaniards feel Catalans \"have an annoying superiority complex. Catalans love to describe themselves as more 'European' than the rest of Spain.\" In Andalucia, one of Spain's poorer provinces, older people recall how they had to travel to Barcelona for work. Powell says Catalonia's economic take-off in the 1960s \"was largely possible thanks to the hundreds of thousands of immigrants from poorer parts of Spain (mainly Andaluc\u00eda, Extremadura and Murcia) who went to work there.\"  The most ardent expression of the rivalry is on the football field, when the two giants of La Liga, Barcelona and Real Madrid meet. As a former Barcelona FC President Joan Gaspart told writer Sid Lowe: \"History has transformed us into something more than a football club: Barcelona is the defense of a country, a language, a culture.\" And Real Madrid was Franco's team. The word 'Democracia', Catalan for 'Democracy', is displayed in the Camp Nou stadium board during FC Barcelona's match.On Sunday, in the empty Camp Nou stadium, the scoreboard showed not the goal tally but one word: Democracia. But Barcelona's opponents, Las Palmas, had the Spanish flag embroidered into their shirts for the occasion. Despite the raw emotions, it would be wrong to see opinion on either side as monolithic. The result of this referendum was distorted by circumstances. Polling suggests that support for Catalan independence has slipped in recent years. In elections two years ago, the pro-independence parties won 48% of the vote. Elsewhere in Spain (with the exception of the Basque country, which has its own history with Madrid), many Spaniards disapprove of what they see as the central government's heavy-handed tactics and are anxious about the broader fallout. There is a real risk that the minority government in Madrid could collapse.The leader of the small but expanding centrist party Ciudadanos, Albert Rivera, was born in Barcelona and has a saying: \"Catalonia is my homeland, Spain is my country and Europe is our future.\"But we are where we are. Powell told CNN the government's \"use of force has tarnished its image at home and abroad. It looks incompetent as well as heavy-handed.\"As the newspaper El Pais wrote Sunday night, Spain's democracy faces its greatest challenge.",

But he wasn't able to maintain his imperious form at the Athens 2004 Olympics, crashing out at the quarterfinal stage to Dutchman Elco van der Geest. \"So many people were focused on me and I disappointed them,\" Inoue reflected afterward, unable to come to terms with defeat. \"I've never experienced anything as humbling and devastating in my life.\"JUST WATCHEDRyoko Tani: The greatest female judoka everReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRyoko Tani: The greatest female judoka ever 03:12READ: \"Judo saved my life\"CoachingInoue retired from judo when he didn't manage to make Japan's Beijing 2008 Olympic team in the heavier +100kg weight category -- though not before winning the 2005 Kano Cup and 2007 Tournoi de Paris.Since bowing out, he has spent time in the United Kingdom, learning about other nations' styles of fighting.

        "content": "Barcelona, Spain (CNN)Spanish national police launched a widespread crackdown on Catalonia's disputed independence referendum Sunday, raiding polling stations and firing rubber bullets in a concerted attempt to deny the vote legitimacy.In scenes that reverberated around Spain, riot police smashed their way into some polling locations and beat back voters with batons as they attempted to take part in the referendum. Regional officials said more than 800 people were injured. The mood on the streets of the regional capital, Barcelona, was tense as polls closed Sunday night. Crowds of people waving the regional flag and banners that read \"Si\" gathered in Plaza Catalonia to await results, which are expected to be announced Sunday night.Shortly after voting ended, Spain's Prime Minister said there was no referendum and that most Catalans were fooled into participating in an illegal vote. Spain's top court declared the referendum illegal. \"At this point, I can tell you very clearly: Today a self-determination referendum in Catalonia didn't happen. We proved today that our state reacts with all its legal means against every provocation,\" Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said in a televised speech.Read MoreBut Catalan President Carles Puigdemont remained defiant Sunday night as he condemned the violence, calling it a \"shameful page\" in the country's history. \"We have won the right to an independent state,\" he said.

Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya S\u00e1enz de Santamar\u00eda blamed the violence on the \"crazy rush\" of the Catalan regional government to hold the \"unconstitutional\" vote.\"The referendum couldn't be held, and it's not been held. To carry on with this farce makes no sense, it doesn't lead anywhere,\" she said in a news conference in Madrid on Sunday.The Spanish Interior Ministry said authorities closed 92 of about 2,300 polling stations. Catalonian officers said police had closed 319 stations.Defending the national police actions, Saenz de Santamaria said their objective had been to seize material associated with the referendum and not to target Catalans.Spanish National Police prevent people from entering a voting site at a school assigned to be a polling station by the Catalan government in Barcelona.Spain's Prime Minister echoed those sentiments Sunday night, accusing Catalonian secessionists with indoctrinating children and \"harassing judges and journalists.\"\"The [Spanish] government always maintained that the referendum would not take place,\" he said. \"[The Catalan government] knew the referendum was illegal and impossible, but they decided to carry forward with their attack to the democratic state.\" Catalan government condemns 'state violence'In Girona, where Puigdemont was due to vote, police smashed their way into a polling station by breaking a glass window.

He challenged the Spanish government's claim that police force was only used to confiscate electoral material, citing the number of people injured and adding that \"rubber bullets and tear gas is not how you seize material.\"He accused Madrid of being responsible for \"a state violence unknown to Spain since the age of Franco,\" referring to the former military dictator Francisco Franco who ruled the country with an iron fist for 36 years until 1975. Baton-wielding Spanish National Police clash with pro-referendum supporters in Barcelona.\"The violation of fundamental rights in Catalonia is not an internal problem of Spain, it is an internal problem of the EU, and we Catalans are citizens of the EU,\" Turull said. When asked by a reporter if the unrest was worth it, he replied, \"Defending democracy will be always worth it.\"In a tweet, the Catalan administration called on the Spanish government representative in the province to resign. \"Considering his remarks, we can only urge him to step down immediately for being directly responsible for the repression seen today\"\u2014 Catalan Government (@catalangov) October 1, 2017\nVoters defy Madrid to cast ballotsPeople wait at the doors of a school in Barcelona to start voting during the Catalan independence referendum.Throughout the region, a combination of excitement and tension prevailed as people cast their votes. Elderly people were applauded as they emerged from polling stations, while others hugged friends.\"This moment means a lot to me,\" Joana Rauet, 89, told CNN after voting at the Josep Maria Jojol school in Barcelona on Sunday. \"I feel satisfied that I was able to take part. I'm feeling very happy,\" she said. People told CNN they were told to stay in case the police arrived to shut the voting station down. \"If the police show up, I will stand my ground. I will peacefully resist,\" Xan Fernando, 20, a student told CNN. A group of firefighters, including Miguel Ruiz, right, vowed to protect the vote.Supporters of the referendum were unsure whether police would attempt to prevent ballot papers from being counted. At the largest polling station in Barcelona, a group of firefighters in uniform joined crowds gathered at the Institut Escola del Treball school to prevent police from seizing the ballots. \"We're here to show support, to help if necessary and also to put ourselves in front if it comes to that,\" said Miguel Ruiz, 44.     Why is the referendum taking place?Catalonia, a wealthy region in Spain's northeast, has its own regional government -- or Generalitat -- which already has considerable powers over health care, education and tax collection. But Catalan nationalists want more, arguing that they are a separate nation with their own history, culture and language and that they should have increased fiscal independence.Catalan referendum, explained: What's behind the push to break from Spain?The region pays tax to Madrid. Pro-independence politicians argue that complex mechanisms for redistributing tax revenue are unfair on wealthier areas and result in Catalonian revenues subsidizing other parts of Spain.\u00a0Others, including the Prime Minister, insist that the country cannot be divided. On Sunday night, Rajoy blamed the referendum for dividing the country and creating violence.\"The referendum that wanted to liquidate our constitution and separate a part of our country with no regards to the opinion of the whole nation did not came into existence,\" he said. \"We showed that our democratic state has the means to protect itself from such a serious attack as the one this illegal referendum represented.\"Catalonia's campaign to break away has been gaining momentum since 2010, when Spain's economy plunged during the financial crisis. Catalonia held a symbolic poll in 2014, in which 80% of voters backed complete secession -- but only 32% of the electorate turned out.People wave Spanish  flags as thousands demonstrate Saturday in Madrid in favor of national unity.In the runup to the vote, national authorities seized ballot papers, voter lists and campaign material. Thousands of extra national police were sent to the region. High-ranking Catalan officials involved in organizing the referendum were arrested. In the past few days, authorities blocked the use of a voting location app and seized vote-counting software.The 5.3 million voters on the electoral roll were being asked to respond yes or no to the question: \"Do you want Catalonia to be an independent state, in the form of a Republic?\"The Catalan government has not yet made clear how it will respond in the event of a \"yes\" vote.CNN's Isa Soares and Vasco Cotovio reported from Barcelona, while Hilary Clarke wrote from London.

That's when the actual draw should start. Former England striker Gary Lineker and Russian football reporter Maria Komandnaya will host the draw and they'll be assisted by superstars from each of the eight nations that have won the World Cup. It is a glittering cast: Diego Maradona (Argentina), Cafu (Brazil), Fabio Cannavaro (Italy), Carles Puyol (Spain), Gordon Banks (England), Laurent Blanc (France), Diego Forlan (Uruguay) and Miroslav Klose (Germany, trophy bearer).

Unlike years past, only FIFA's world rankings determines which country goes into which pot and, for this draw, the sport's world governing body has based the seedings on October's world rankings.So, for example, the seven top-ranked teams that qualified, plus Russia, are in pot 1 and the next highest-ranked eight are in pot 2 and so forth, ending with the lowest ranked eight in pot four. Germany are the reigning world champions.Pot 1: Russia, Germany, Brazil, Portugal, Argentina, Belgium, Poland, FrancePot 2: Spain, Switzerland, England, Colombia, Mexico, Uruguay, Croatia, PeruPot 3: Iceland, Costa Rica, Sweden, Tunisia, Egypt, Senegal, Iran, DenmarkPot 4: Nigeria, Australia, Japan, Morocco, Panama, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, SerbiaAs host Russia was placed in pot 1, a boost for them since Stanislav Cherchesov's men -- based on those October rankings -- are the lowest-ranked team in the tournament at No. 65, two places behind Saudi Arabia. Among others in the elite tier are defending champions Germany, record five-time winners Brazil, European champions Portugal and 2014 World Cup runners-up Argentina. The end result will be eight groups of four teams. There is one last caveat -- no group is allowed to feature more than one team from the same confederation, apart from members of European football's governing body UEFA, which, with 14 teams, provided the highest number of qualifiers. No more than two UEFA countries are allowed in a group.

A \"Group of Death?\"Every major football draw seems to produce a so-called \"Group of Death.\" The term was reportedly first coined in reference to Group 3 of the 1970 World Cup, featuring reigning champions England, favorites Brazil, 1962 runners-up Czechoslovakia and Romania. \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddec Egypt\ud83c\udfc6 First World Cup since 1990\ud83c\udf0d Most successful team in African Cup of Nations historyWith over 150 caps and his 45th birthday approaching, goalkeeper @ElHadary is set to become the oldest player in World Cup history. #WorldCupDraw pic.twitter.com/KHyZdb9iYB\u2014 CNN Sport (@cnnsport) November 30, 2017\n\nBut, the \"Group of Death\" isn't necessarily always a single entity -- in 2014 it was widely acknowledged that there were three difficult groups. Friday's draw could potentially pit Brazil, former champions Spain, seven-time Africa Cup of Nations champions Egypt and Serbia against each other. With Spain and England among the second batch of teams, there are a number of mouthwatering scenarios to speculate over before the draw. Who could not get excited about the prospect of Germany, England, Egypt --  returning to the World Cup for the first time since 1990 -- and Nigeria forming one group? Who are the favorites?  Neymar celebrates after scoring against Paraguay during a World Cup qualifying match.Defending champions Germany are bidding to become the first team to retain the title since Brazil did so in 1962. Ranked No.1 in the world and unbeaten since their Euro 2016 semifinal defeat by France, Joachim L\u00f6w's men were peerless in qualifying, winning all 10 of their matches and scoring 43 goals in the process.  Five-time champions Brazil were the first South American team to qualify for Russia 2018 and their form in the last 18 months has helped heal the wounds of that 7-1 semifinal thumping by Germany at their home World Cup three years ago. Coach Adenor Leonardo Bacchi, known as Tite, has overseen a vast improvement since he succeeded Dunga in June 2016. Brazil remain undefeated in competitive fixtures since the new man took charge and won 10 of their final 12 qualification matches. With Lionel Messi in their ranks -- the Barcelona star scored an incredible hat-trick to secure Argentina's place in Russia - Argentina are among the bookmakers' favorites, as are previous World Cup winners Spain, France and Portugal. Belgium have promised much with the talent at their disposal and after a fine qualifying campaign -- they topped their group with an unbeaten run -- 2018 could be the year the Red Devils finally blossom.

In Russia, there will be two: Iceland and Panama. Iceland became the smallest nation -- population of around 335,000 -- to ever qualify for the World Cup by topping, fittingly perhaps, Group I in Europe. While Iceland's inclusion might not be a surprise -- they made the quarterfinals of Euro 2016, beating England en route  -- Panama's most certainly is. Panama didn't even qualify for the final round of 2014 World Cup qualifying in the Concacaf region and were knocked out in the quarterfinals at this year's Gold Cup in a 12-team field. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela declared a public holiday following qualification.

Such was the euphoria when Jefferson Farfan scored the opener in the second leg in Lima, it caused an earthquake in Peru's capital city.\"An earthquake alert was activated due to the underground vibration generated by the fans,\" wrote the official seismology page of Chile, which borders Peru. Who will be missing?Spare a thought for Italian fans. The Azzurri -- four-time winners -- missed out on the World Cup for the first time since 1958 after losing a two-leg playoff against Sweden. It marked the end of legendary keeper Gianluigi Buffon's 20-year international career. Buffon cries after Italy is eliminated.Although Buffon, the most capped Italian in history, is likely to be tormented when watching Russia 2018, he can at least take solace from the fact that he was a key member of Italy's World Cup winning team in 2006. Go to CNN.com/sport for more stories & featuresOther high-profile nations not in the draw are 2010 World Cup runners-up the Netherlands, traditional Concacaf powerhouse the US and Alexis Sanchez's Chile. Two recent ever-presents of African football, Ivory Coast and Ghana, also failed to emerge from an arduous qualifying campaign. Both nations had qualified for three successive World Cups, but failure to reach Russia 2018 ended up costing Belgian Marc Wilmots his job as manager of Les Elephants.",

But she insisted the US-UK relationship would survive the storm, and suggested the visit by Trump would go ahead.As the extraordinary diplomatic clash stretched into a second day, the British ambassador to the US revealed he had expressed concerns to the White House about the affair. Trump also faced an unprecedented barrage of criticism in UK Parliament, where MPs variously called him \"racist,\" \"fascist\" and \"evil.\" Some suggested he should quit Twitter.Asked about Trump's actions on a visit to Amman, Jordan, May said: \"I'm very clear that retweeting from Britain First was the wrong thing to do.

It stands against common British decency,\" she said.Theresa May addresses guests and media during a speech in Amman, JordanBut May declined to rescind the offer of a visit. \"The invitation for a state visit has been extended and has been accepted.

It will be Vonn's first Games since Vancouver in 2010, where her downhill triumph turned her into a global star and one of the world's best-paid winter athletes with a net worth, according to Forbes, of about $3 million.

        "content": "(CNN)As the judge at The Hague read out a verdict confirming Slobodan Praljak's 20-year prison term for war crimes, the white-bearded former Bosnian Croat general rose to his feet.\"Slobodan Praljak is not a war criminal. I am rejecting your verdict with contempt,\" Praljak shouted defiantly.He then tilted his head back and drank from a small vial. As the judge appealed for him to sit down, Praljak declared: \"I have taken poison.\" The judge, looking disconcerted, suspended proceedings. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia confirmed later Wednesday that Praljak had been given immediate medical help in the courtroom before being taken to the hospital, where he died.Emergency services personnel head toward the tribunal building in The Hague on Wednesday.Authorities in the Netherlands were on Thursday urgently investigating what the substance was and how Praljak was able to obtain it while being held in UN detention.Read MoreThe dramatic courtroom scene unfolded as the work of the UN tribunal, set up to prosecute crimes committed during conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s, came to a close after more than 20 years.Wednesday's appeal hearing, which reaffirmed the sentences imposed in 2013 on Praljak and five other former Bosnian Croat leaders for crimes against humanity and war crimes and almost all their convictions, was the tribunal's final ruling and it will formally close at the end of the year.Significantly, the appeal judges upheld the earlier trial's findings that implicated the Croatian regime under then-President Franjo Tudjman in a criminal conspiracy with the goal of \"ethnic cleansing of the Muslim population\" of parts of Bosnia to ensure Croatian domination.The Bosnian Croat leadership, along with Croat leaders, wanted to make this territory part of a \"Greater Croatia,\" the ICTY said when the case first went through the court.Slobodan Praljak drinks the contents of a small vial in a Hague courtroom on Wednesday.How did Praljak obtain poison?Dutch authorities are now investigating the apparent security breach which allowed Praljak to take his own life. The ICTY said only that he had drunk \"a liquid\" and quickly fallen ill.Croatian lawyer Goran Mikuli\u010di\u0107 told CNN's local affiliate N1 that \"anyone could have brought him a bottle of poison easily.\" He said family, friends, journalists and lawyers were allowed to visit Praljak but that only lawyers were allowed to take bags into the detention facility.Praljak isn't the first war criminal or suspect to kill himself while being held in the ICTY detention units.Former Croatian Serb leader makes his initial apparance at the Hague tribunal in November 2003. Milan Babi\u0107, the president of the self-proclaimed \"Serb Republic of Krajina\" in Croatia, killed himself in 2006 after being convicted of crimes against humanity and war crimes against Croat civilians during the war in Croatia.War crimes suspect Slavko Dokmanovic was found hanged in his cell in 1998 as he awaited the verdict in his trial.Former Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, who faced charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and other war crimes for his role in the conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Kosovo, died in 2006 while on trial at The Hague.The official investigation into his death confirmed that non-prescribed pills were found in his cell, but couldn't prove his intent to take his own life.Slobodan Milosevic is seen during his initial hearing before the ICTY in The Hague in July 2001.Edo Batlak, a former prisoner at one of the concentration camps the former Bosnian Croat leaders were convicted of creating, told N1 he believed Praljak's action was influenced by his pre-war role as a theater director.\"Praljak is a director by profession. So this aligns with his profession, he wants to be remembered by it,\" he said.Praljak, who was detained in 2004, had already served two-thirds of his 20-year sentence, for offenses committed between 1992 and 1994, and would have been eligible for release in the coming months.What's the response in Croatia and Bosnia?Despite being a convicted war criminal, Praljak still commands significant support in Croatia, in an indication of how the scars of the 1990s conflicts are yet to heal fully. The Parliament of Croatia, or Sabor, began Thursday's session with a moment of silence to honor Praljak and all war victims.The Parliament's President, Goran Jandrokovi\u0107, read a statement in which he said all parties represented in the chamber agreed that the verdict \"does not honor historical truth, facts and proof\" and as such was \"unjust and unacceptable.\" Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic gives a press conference following Praljak's death. Representatives of the Social Democratic Party of Croatia and the liberal GLAS party, were not present for the minute of silence.Croatia's Prime Minister, Andrej Plenkovic, had already offered his condolences and those of his government following news of Praljak's death.Other Croat politicians also rejected the verdict.Croatia's President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovi\u0107, who spoke Thursday after cutting short a state visit to Iceland, said: \"His act struck the heart of the Croatian nation. Croatia was not the aggressor, but, along with the United States, did most for the unity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Croatia and Bosnia were attacked by Milo\u0161evi\u0107's Serbia and the Yugoslav National Army and those are facts. Croatia didn't attack anyone.\"Dragan \u010covi\u0107, a Croat member of the Presidency of Bosnia, said: \"We consider this (the verdict) primarily a crime against all honorable representatives of the Croat military forces and the Croat nation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\"About 1,000 Bosnian Croats gathered in a square in the southern Bosnian town of Mostar -- where some of the fiercest fighting occurred in the 1990s -- late on Wednesday to light candles in support of Praljak, Reuters news agency reported.Bosnian Croats and residents of Mostar light candles in tribute to Slobodan Praljak in Mostar on Wednesday.'Take responsibility'The other former Bosnian Croat leaders whose sentences were affirmed by the Appeals Chamber include Jadranko Prli\u0107, prime minister of the self-proclaimed \"Croat Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia,\" who was given 25 years in prison. Prli\u0107 led Croat separatists within Bosnia who wanted a part of Bosnia to be annexed to Croatia in collusion with Tudjman. His niece, Lana Prli\u0107, who is vice president of the Social Democratic Party of Bosnia, notably spoke out in support of the Hague tribunal in a statement on Facebook Wednesday morning.\"I respect and accept the verdict of the Court in the Hague,\" she wrote. \"In our life, we have several families -- the one we choose and the one we are born into. The Social Democratic Party of Bosnia is my family that I chose as an activist in 2010. At the same time, I can't and don't want to escape the family whose surname I've carried since my birth in 1993. Everyone has to take responsibility for their crimes.\"She called on politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Croatia to respect the court and also the victims of war crimes and their families, who had suffered for years.Croat politician Goran Beus Richembergh, of GLAS, wrote on Facebook that he had received a number of death threats, including threats to kill his wife, after an earlier post in which he welcomed the verdict and called Praljak a lawfully convicted war criminal. Beus Richembergh said he had alerted the police. He told Croatian TV channel Nova TV: \"In the mass of insults I get every day for publicly taking a stand, I got threats that can be considered serious. Now the police have to solve it.\"CNN has sought comment from the police in Zagreb.According to the GLAS Facebook page, fellow party member Vesna Pusi\u0107, a former foreign minister of Croatia who also welcomed the verdict, has also received a death threat.CNN's Lauren Moorhouse and Hilary McGann contributed to this report.",

Except this time the two-time Super Bowl MVP was no longer the main man -- he was the understudy.It's a sight few -- including Manning himself -- could have envisioned heading into this week: relegated to the scout team, splitting reps with rookie Davis Webb.Follow @cnnsport\n\nGiants head coach Ben McAdoo shocked the NFL world Tuesday, announcing that he will start Geno Smith at quarterback for Sunday's game against the Raiders.It snaps Manning's streak of 210 consecutive regular-season games, the second-longest by a quarterback in NFL history behind Brett Favre (297).\"It's hard,\" Manning, who visibly was emotional, said Tuesday. \"It's been a hard day to handle this. But hang in there and figure it out.\"Read MoreWATCH: Eli Manning reacts to the announcement that he will not start on Sunday pic.twitter.com/nQoPEcfTl3\u2014 New York Giants (@Giants) November 28, 2017\n\nManning said McAdoo gave him the opportunity to start while Smith and Webb would also get to play, but he felt that starting just to keep his streak going and knowing he wouldn't finish the game felt \"pointless.\"\"I mean, I just didn't think that you start knowing that you're going to come out of a game to keep a streak alive, maybe,\" Manning said.\"That's not what it's about. It's not a preseason game where you're going to play the start to the half, what's the next week? A quarter, a series, that's not fair. That's not fair to me, that's not fair to Geno, that's not how you play.\"You play to win. You're named the starting quarterback, you think it's your job to go win the football game. When you know you're just going to play a little bit, I didn't feel like that was the right way to play.\"Quarterback Eli Manning turns 37 on January 3.'Pathetic'Manning had started every Giants game since November 21, 2004, dating back to his rookie season -- where he was the No. 1 overall pick in the draft -- when he took over for Kurt Warner. He led the Giants to two Super Bowl titles, both against the Patriots.The Giants are 2-9 this season. McAdoo cited being out of contention and evaluating his roster -- including at quarterback -- as the reason for the change. Manning, who has 14 touchdown passes to seven interceptions this season, will turn 37 on January 3.\"Well, I have a lot of confidence in Eli as a player, as a quarterback,\" McAdoo said. \"But at this point, it's my responsibility for the organization to make sure we take a look at Geno and at some point take a look at Davis and give them the opportunity to show what they can do heading into next year.\"So is this the end of Manning in a Giants uniform? \"No,\" McAdoo said, though his decision was questioned by current NFL players and alumni, who lit up social media reacting to the news.\"One guy should not be demoted because of a TEAMS effort and lack production,\" former safety Antrel Rolle posted on Instagram. \"If Eli gets demoted then the entire team should be demoted.\"    I will say this without saying too much. Right is Right and Wrong is Wrong. One guy should not be demoted because of a TEAMS effort and lack production. If Eli gets demoted then the entire team should be demoted. All of his weapons are non existing and still the guys shows up every week and gives his all. That has to stand for something. There are ways to go about things and this is not the right way to go about this. Give him a fair evaluation under fair circumstances.

        "content": "London (CNN)The Twitter account of US President Donald Trump on Wednesday retweeted three inflammatory videos posted by the deputy leader of the UK far-right group Britain First. Here's what we know about it.Founded as a political party in 2011, Britain First is an ultra-nationalist organization that opposes immigration and claims to have \"a proven track record of opposing Islamic militants and hate preachers.\"According to Searchlight, a magazine that investigates and reports on far-right and fascist groups, Britain First emerged as a splinter group following a collapse in support for the far-right British National Party. But it is far from being a mainstream organization in the UK. It has no elected representatives at any level of British politics and was \"deregistered\" as a political party earlier this month by the UK Electoral Commission. Its occasional protests rarely attract crowds of more than a few dozen.In its mission statement, Britain First describes itself as \"a patriotic resistance and 'frontline' for our long suffering people\" that will \"restore Christianity as the bedrock\" of national life and put British workers first.Read More\"We want our people to come first, before foreigners, asylum seekers or migrants and we are overtly proud of this stance,\" it says. \"We will not stand back and watch as our people are made second class citizens by leftwing-liberal policies and political correctness.\"The mission statement says that it would end all immigration to the UK.Britain First leader Paul Golding and deputy leader Jayda Fransen arrive at the Royal Courts of Justice in central London.The videos retweeted by Trump's account allegedly depict Muslims assaulting people and, in one video, smashing a statue of the Virgin Mary.They were posted by Jayda Fransen, the party's deputy leader since 2014, who reacted jubilantly online, highlighting that the videos had been shared with Trump's nearly 44 million followers. \"GOD BLESS YOU TRUMP!\" she wrote in all caps.Fransen, who has about 60,000 followers of her own on Twitter, is no stranger to controversy -- or the UK legal system.She was found guilty of religiously aggravated harassment in November 2016 for abusing a Muslim woman wearing a hijab while she was with her four children. Fransen was fined.She also faces four charges of causing religiously aggravated harassment as part of a Kent Police investigation into the distribution of leaflets and the posting of online videos during a rape trial of four men of Afghan origin in May. She pleaded not guilty to the charges at a court hearing in October, CNN affiliate ITV News reported.Police officers monitor a Britain First protest march in Luton, England, in June 2015.On November 19, she was arrested and charged for using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behavior after a speech made in Northern Ireland against terrorism. She has not yet entered a plea but in a Twitter video, party leader Paul Golding described the charges as without merit.In 2015, a court temporarily barred Fransen and Golding from entering mosques or Islamic centers without prior invitation. Police had asked for the ban following a Britain First demonstration in Luton, a town with a large Muslim population, in which the group was accused of offensive actions and remarks. The following year, police obtained an injunction from the High Court that banned the pair from mosques for three years.Britain First has not yet responded to a CNN request for comment.On its website, Britain First says it \"rejects racial hatred in all its forms\" and that members of ethnic minorities regularly attend its events. CNN has not been able to verify that claim.CNN's Carol Jordan and Katie Polglase contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)More than 150 cases of alleged sexual assault have been uncovered in a remote region in northern Norway, according to a police report published Tuesday.The alleged crimes stretch over several decades, with some dating back to 1953 and the most recent occurring in August this year. They all took place in the rural municipality of Tysfjord, which has only around 2,000 inhabitants.Of the 151 cases, 43 involve rape, including three assaults on children. Sexual intercourse with children under 14 is the alleged offense in 40 of the cases.Sexual harassment: How it stands around the globeThe youngest of the 82 victims is four years old, while the 92 suspects are between 10 and 80 years of age, according to the report.Police said most of the alleged suspects and victims belong to the Sami community, formerly known as Lapps, an ethnic minority group descended from nomadic peoples who inhabited northern Scandinavia for thousands of years.Read More\"I'm very sad for the community,\" Vibeke Larsen, president of the Sami Parliamentary Council, an elected body that promotes the interests of the Sami in Norway, told CNN. \"They've been through a hard process and they have a hard process ahead of them.\"'A national tragedy'A report by the Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang in June 2016 prompted the police investigation. In an article for the paper during the course of the probe, Larsen described the scandal as \"a national tragedy\" and called for help from national authorities. \"The extent of the tragedy has become so great that it is not realistic to believe that a small municipality will be able to handle this alone.\"The Tysfjord municipality in northern Norway is home to about 2,000 people.She also praised the people who had come forward to tell their stories. \"By breaking taboos about sexual assault, they are in a position to change the society they are part of.\"The majority of the roughly 65,000 Sami live in Norway, with other communities in Sweden, Finland and Russia. There are three different -- and mutually unintelligible -- Sami languages.Periodic attempts to assimilate these communities into Scandinavian societies have often been met with resistance by the Sami, many of whom are keen to preserve their culture and traditions.Many of the people involved in the alleged crimes were also affiliated with the Laestadian Church, a conservative Lutheran revival movement, according to the report.The police said they had \"no reason to believe that ethnicity or belief in itself can explain the extent of the assaults,\" but acknowledged that certain cultural factors had played a role in the lack of reporting.Strong family ties and loyalty to the ethnic community are highly valued among the Sami, the report explains, but these also acted as \"mechanisms that create silence about assault.\"Many victims were reluctant to tell their story for fear of damaging family ties or breaking up the community, according to the report.There was, however, a \"strong desire to break the silence,\" the report said. Police admit mistakesWidespread distrust of authorities, including the police, was also a significant factor in allowing the scandal to be hidden for so long, according to the report. The police said that a key goal of the investigation had been to build trust with the Sami community, as well as to prosecute offenders and prevent new abuses.The Sami \"don't trust the police as much as the Norwegians do,\" said Larsen. In the past, Sami people have often been told to become \"good Norwegians and leave their own culture, language and symbols behind,\" she explained. \"That's why they have distrust in the system.\"\"They try to fix their problems in their own communities, their own families, and not use the system as it should be used,\" she said.She said she had heard reports that the community in Tysfjord was starting to trust the police more. \"They can see that the police will help them,\" she said. \"But trust is built slowly.\"Norwegian police officials Aslak Finvik, Oeyvind A. Rengard and Tone Vangen (left to right) spoke to the press on Tuesday about the investigation. Police Chief Tone Vangen admitted at a news conference Tuesday that errors had been made before the official investigation began last June. \"I see that the job the police did up to June 2016 was not good enough,\" she said. \"On behalf of the police, I would like to offer my sincerest apologies.\"During the investigation, the police also received extensive documentation indicating that children in the community had been exposed to serious neglect as well as alcohol abuse and violence.\"Although many of the cases occurred a long time ago, it is still hard to understand that no one has seen anything or intervened,\" the report said.'We must dare to listen'The investigation was launched two days after a report headlined \"The dark secret\" was published in Verdens Gang, in which 11 people from Tysfjord told their stories of abuse.Ylva Maria Pavval, who runs Niejda, an organization for Sami girls and women, responded with an open letter calling for more openness within the Sami community.\"The Sami people is a minority in the greater communities of our nations, and it's natural and understandable that we'd want to protect our people, our local community and our families,\" she wrote.\"This, however, makes it more difficult to report a crime committed by one of our own. As it is, it takes great courage and requires sacrifices to do so.\"When these stories make their way into daylight, we must dare listen to them,\" she wrote.\"We need to find ways to deal with these issues in Sami society so that we can ensure that victims get all the support they need.\"CNN's Jim Stenman contributed to this article.",

I was very lucky as the two owners of the kebab shop came to help me push the attacker to the ground,\" Hollstein said. Police then arrived and arrested the assailant.The German town of Altena has welcomed 370 refugees.The incident comes amid a political crisis in the country following recent elections that paved the way for the far-right Alternative for Germany party to enter Parliament for the first time. Read MoreThe party campaigned against Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision two years ago to welcome more than a million refugees from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Talks to form a new coalition government are proving difficult. In September CNN visited Altena and interviewed Hollstein about the decision to welcome refugees to the town.Merkel called Hollstein, who is a member of her Christian Democratic Union party, to wish him a speedy recovery, according to her spokesman Steffen Seibert.German police said the 56-year-old attacker, identified only as Werner S., had been drinking.Through Germany's open door: What life is really like for refugees He was known to authorities because of a minor violent assault in 2013 and also a traffic incident, but so far no connections to the organized far-right have been established, police said.  Hollstein blamed the attack on hate propaganda circulating on social media. \"The handling of the subject of refugees is getting tougher and more ruthless, if they ask me about it, I see this as a decline in values in our society,\" he said. \"I think that the poison that people spread on social media or other platforms enters into simple minds; as such, I would also designate the culprit. I have no hatred for these people. For me he has been a tool for others.\"  It is not the first time the small steel town has witnessed refugee-related violence. When Altena was deciding whether or not to accept additional refugees, a young man hurled a firebomb into the home of a Syrian family, damaging the dwelling and sending its inhabitants to the hospital for smoke inhalation.Henriette Reker, the current mayor of Cologne, who was also stabbed two years ago for pro-refugee policies and suffered life-threatening injuries, issued a statement in support of Hollstein.\"Such an attack changes your life, but it must not change our behavior and commitment,\" she said.\"We have to continue addressing our tasks with openness and strength. Hate and violence are not solutions -- they are the problem.\"",

It was a \"cozy night\" earlier this month at the couple's Nottingham Cottage at Kensington Palace and the pair were roasting a chicken, the American actor said. Or trying to roast a chicken, Harry said, correcting her. \"It was so sweet and natural and very romantic. He got down on one knee,\" she said. \"As a matter of fact, I could barely let you finish proposing. I said, 'Can I say yes now?'\" The pair giggled as they fondly remembered the moment.

The ring!'\"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle speak for the first time since their engagement.\"It was a really nice moment,\" the prince said. \"It was just the two of us, and I think I managed to catch her by surprise as well.\"Read MoreCozy nights have been a theme of their courtship, they said. To avoid the media scrutiny -- which, at times, has been none too kind to Markle and her beau -- they've avoided nights on the town, instead opting for evenings at home, away from the paparazzi and their prying lenses. In essence, they had to \"reverse the whole process,\" the prince said. These were among the revelations -- along with Harry's belief that Markle and his mother, the late Princess Diana, would be \"thick as thieves\" -- divulged by the royal couple-to-be in an interview with BBC's Mishal Husain. The interview aired Monday evening, hours after the pair announced that they planned to wed following an 18-month romance.

The two met for a drink in July 2016 on a blind date, brokered by a mutual friend, whose name they would not reveal, but \"it was definitely a setup,\" Markle said.They didn't know much about each other. Markle wasn't too familiar with the British royal family, and Prince Harry had never seen the television show, \"Suits,\" nor any other example of Markle's work. \n\n\n\n\nHarry recalled his first impression: \"I was beautifully surprised when I walked into that room and saw her. There she was sitting there.\" What Markle tells us about the modern royal family He thought, \"I'm going to have to up my game.\"Shortly after their first encounter, during which they shared their passions and the changes they'd like to effect in the world, they decided another date was in order. \"What are we doing tomorrow? We should meet again,\" Markle recalled asking. Prince Harry was about to head off to Africa, and Markle was busy filming \"Suits.\"\"We need to get the diaries out and find out how we're going to make this work,\" Harry thought at the time.

The family has been \"so welcoming,\" helping Markle to acclimate not only to life at Kensington Palace but to the royal family itself, she said. Certain four-legged members of the family have been particularly hospitable, the prince said.

        "content": "(CNN)Meghan Markle intends to become a UK citizen, the British royal family has announced, confirming that the American actor's marriage to Prince Harry would take place at Windsor Castle in May next year.Kensington Palace said that Windsor, a royal residence west of London, had become \"a special place for the two of them.\"A spokesman said Markle would retain US citizenship through the process of becoming a UK citizen but it was \"too early to say\" if she would retain dual nationality. The process is expected to take several years.The wedding is likely to fall after another big royal occasion -- Harry's older brother, Prince William, and his wife, the former Kate Middleton, are expecting their third child in April.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle at a photocall to announce their engagement at Kensington Palace in London.News of the couple's engagement was announced on Monday and came after months of speculation. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle made their first public appearance as an engaged couple in the gardens of Kensington Palace on Monday afternoon, where Harry told reporters he knew Markle was \"the one\" from \"the very first time we met.\"\n\n\n\n\nRead MoreTheir first official joint engagement will take place in the city of Nottingham on Friday, where they will greet members of the public together for the first time before attending an event to mark World AIDS Day.Kensington Palace also confirmed that the royal family will pay for the \"core elements\" of the marriage ceremony, including the church service, the music, the flowers and reception afterwards.After the wedding, Markle will become the fourth patron of The Royal Foundation, a charitable organization set up in 2009 by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry.The couple will live in Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace, the official residence of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. One of Markle's two dogs, Guy, is already in the UK, while the other, Bogart, is now with friends of Markle's in Canada. A church weddingIn choosing St George's Chapel at Windsor as the venue, the couple are following in royal tradition. Most recently, the church was the scene of the wedding of Peter Phillips -- son of Princess Anne and cousin to Harry -- who married Autumn Kelly in 2008. Although Markle has been married before, that will not pose any obstacle to a church wedding as the Church of England permits divorcees to remarry. Meghan Markle is royal family's unconventional bride-to-be The last royal wedding involving a divorcee was a civil ceremony rather than a church marriage. Harry's father, Prince Charles, married Camilla Parker Bowles in 2005 in a town hall in Windsor.The then Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, agreed the arrangements were \"consistent with Church of England guidelines concerning remarriage.\" The Church of England nevertheless allows the remarriage of divorced people \"in exceptional circumstances.\" Rules state that divorcees must be asked a series of questions designed to ensure \"past hurts\" have been healed and mistakes learned from.The couple will wed in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.Although Markle attended a Catholic school as a child, she is not a practicing Roman Catholic, so an Anglican wedding will not raise any denominational questions. Kensington Palace said she would be baptized into the Church of England before the wedding.Current Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said Monday he was \"absolutely delighted\" at news of the wedding. \"I have met Prince Harry on a number of occasions and have always been struck by his commitment and passion for his charities, and his immense love for his family,\" he said in a statement.

The machine provides basic necessities -- water, fresh fruit, sandwiches, socks, toiletries and books.

It's eyeing London, New York City, San Francisco and Los Angeles as possible locations. \"My ultimate hope for Action Hunger is for our idea to take root in cities all over the world, and for the homeless to have a lifeline to rely on while government policies work towards ending homelessness for once and for all,\" Khaled said.",

Gauff was beaten by Amanda Anisimova in the US Open's junior girls final.READ: Hingis -- The flame that burned twice'There is only one Serena'Frenchman Mouratoglou, who has coached Williams to 10 major singles titles since they started working together in 2012, is impressed with the young American.\"She's amazing because she's an incredible fighter and she is an incredible athlete,\" Mouratoglou told CNN. \"She goes for her shots and takes the risks.\"Although Mouratoglou didn't want to compare Gauff to Williams \"because there is only one Serena,\" he thinks she has a bright future.\"She has a lot to learn of course, because she is very young,\" he said. \"But if she keeps the same attitude that she has now, if she keeps her head where it should be ... if she keeps the same attitude and the same hunger for the game, I think she can go really far.\"Gauff says she wants to meet the standard of Serena Williams.READ: Serena ties the knot\"Capriati Rule\"Gauff may be a future star but tennis fans won't be able to see her play a full schedule on the women's WTA tour until she is 18 years old.That's because of the so-called \"age eligibility rule\" which was introduced in 1994 to prevent players from burning out at an early age, when they are not fully developed mentally and physically.The rule is also known as the \"Capriati Rule,\" following the rapid rise of the American teenage star, who was ranked inside the Top 10 at the age of 14 and won Olympic gold in Barcelona two years later.However, by the mid-1990s, Capriati's career stalled amid off-court problems including arrests for shoplifting and marijuana possession charges. She later returned to win three majors and rise to world No. 1. At 13, Gauff isn't allowed to play in any events on the WTA Tour, the ITF women's circuit, the Fed Cup or the Olympics.When she turns 14 in March, she will be allowed to play in two WTA events. The number of tournaments she will be allowed to enter gradually increases each year until she is 18, when she will be free to compete in an unlimited number.JUST WATCHEDMouratoglou on Serena comeback and McEnroeReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMouratoglou on Serena comeback and McEnroe 02:19READ: Serena 'owned me,' admits SharapovaExtra pressureAlthough former Wimbledon champion Lindsay Davenport agrees with the age rule in principle, she feels it may also put extra pressure on young players.\"I understand what the WTA is trying to do,\" Davenport told reporters at the US Open. \"I don't love it. I think when some of these youngsters get into a tournament, they feel even more pressure.\"Nine-time Wimbledon winner Martina Navratilova said the rule could negatively impact exceptional talents such as Gauff because they aren't able to compete with the very best during much of their teenage years.\"I think they could and should ease up a little bit,\" Navratilova said in a news conference at the US Open. \"We are trying to be the parents, and we're not the parents.

That would be my biggest challenge, trying to stay calm and enjoying the pressure moments.\"Working with Mouratoglou was a revelation.\"He's helped me change so much in my game,\" Gauff said. \"When I went there for the first time, I learnt I can't be all flat all the time, I learnt how to hit spin.\" She also met seasoned pros such as France's Alize Cornet, ATP Finals champion Grigor Dimitrov and her idol Serena Williams.\"Serena, she told me to keep working hard and to keep doing what I'm doing,\" Gauff said. \"It means a lot just to know that someone that amazing is still encouraging younger players to be better than her and be as good as her.

Ronaldo and his fans can rest easy knowing that this handsome bronze figure, made by famous Spanish sculptor Jose Antonio Navarro Arteaga, will forever uphold Ronaldo's beauty.It shows a more striking likeness of Ronaldo with naturalistic eyes dreamily looking into the distance, thick arched brows, a beauty mark resting above lifelike curved lips and perfectly coiffed hair, among other details.The first try at capturing his face was a \"total bust\" when Portuguese artist Emanuel Santos designed a sculpture of Ronaldo's head to commemorate an airport being renamed after him. Being honored as the namesake of the new Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport came with a statue that looked nothing like the soccer god.The original bust, which is still at the airport in Portugal, has an awkward grin with unlevel eyes, faint and indistinct eyebrows and unevenly plump cheeks.Read MoreSome social media users said the bust looked more like other athletes, obscure art and the character Sloth from the film \"The Goonies.\" It was like something from a horror movie, one football podcast joked on Twitter.

But Henry Charles Albert David Mountbatten-Windsor -- fifth in line to the British throne and better known as Prince Harry -- will have few places to hide after the announcement that he is engaged to his American girlfriend Meghan Markle.Born on September 15, 1984, Harry was the second and last child born into the ill-fated marriage of Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales.The pair divorced in 1996, and Diana died a year later. Not yet a teenager, Harry walked behind his mother's coffin in images broadcast to a global audience.Harry took up a place at the school his mother chose for him, the prestigious Eton College -- following in the footsteps of his older brother, Prince William.After leaving Eton, he traveled the world before enrolling at Sandhurst military academy in Berkshire, England. His nickname there was \"Harry Potter,\" according to Lieutenant Kayon Mills, who trained with the prince. After completing the course he joined the Blues and Royals regiment of the British Army.

But his deployment was canceled just three months later after a number of threats were made against him.In December that year he was sent in secret to Afghanistan, where he served for four months until his presence there became publicly known. Along with the other members of his regiment, he received the Operational Service Medal for his service in Afghanistan.After qualifying as an Apache helicopter pilot -- and being promoted to the rank of captain -- he returned to Afghanistan in 2012 on a 20-week deployment. He flew on scores of missions and later admitted killing Taliban insurgents. It was sometimes justified to \"take a life to save a life,\" he said. \"That's what we revolve around, I suppose.\" That was his last mission as an active soldier -- in June 2015, Kensington Palace announced that Harry had ended his army career.Prince Harry served two tours in Afghanistan with the British Army.RebelHarry hasn't always been known for his military discipline. In fact, he's often described as the rebellious royal.In 2002, he faced accusations of under-age drinking and cannabis use. The prince was a 16-year-old schoolboy at the time of the alleged incident.Three years later, he caused outrage by wearing a Nazi uniform to a costume party. He later apologized, admitting \"it was a poor choice of costume.\"In 2012, photos emerged of Harry partying nude in a Las Vegas hotel. A palace official explained that he was \"on a private holiday.\"The prince has been the subject of far fewer sensational headlines in recent years. Prince Harry amuses Emily Henson, daughter of Hayley Henson, at the Sitting Volleyball Finals during the Invictus Games in September this year.Harry appears to be prepared to speak more critically of the royal institution than the rest of his family. In an interview with Newsweek in June this year, Harry questioned whether the position of king or queen was even a desirable one.\"Is there any one of the royal family who wants to be king or queen?\" he asked. \"I don't think so, but we will carry out our duties at the right time.\"And in an unusual public statement last November, he openly criticized the British media for subjecting Meghan Markle to \"a wave of abuse and harrassment\" including \"outright sexism and racism.\" He asked the press to \"pause and reflect before any more damage is done.\"ActivistAs is customary for members of the British royal family, Harry is an active campaigner for a number of charitable causes.In 2006 he co-founded a charity to help AIDS orphans in the southern African state of Lesotho. His more recent work has focused on the needs of army veterans and people with mental health problems.He has trekked to the North Pole and the South Pole with veterans charity Walking With The Wounded and founded the Invictus Games in 2014, an international sporting competition for injured servicemen and women.In the last year, Harry has joined Prince William and wife Catherine in efforts to tackle the stigma of mental illness. As part of that effort, the brothers talked openly for the first time about the death of their mother.Prince Harry races against his older brother and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, in February 2017 at an event for mental health initiative Heads Together.In an interview with British newspaper The Telegraph in April, Prince Harry spoke candidly about the \"total chaos\" he experienced after losing his mother, and the problems caused by bottling up his emotions rather than talking about them.He revealed that he sought counseling at age 28, at the urging of his brother. He also admitted that the pressure of being in the public eye caused him to be \"very close to a complete breakdown on numerous occasions.\"The counseling helped, he explained, and he said he feels \"in a good place.\"",

That's the closest way I can describe it, you're at this really hyped-up party. \"In basketball there's a slam dunk contest and that's what long drive is to golf ... I think it's gonna be something huge. I really believe that.\" READ: The longest hole in golf Allen has won multiple times on the American-based World Long Drive tour and, as well as being one of golf's most powerful drivers, he's also emerged as one of the sport's biggest personalities. His off-the-cuff impersonation of veteran US wrestler Ric Flair after his win at last July's Mile High Showdown in Denver went down a storm on social media.Maurice Allen adds a little Flair to golf \ud83c\udfcc\ud83d\udcaa pic.twitter.com/cg27tXYSNM\u2014 Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) September 21, 2017  Allen's infectious enthusiasm for the game wasn't always quite so evident. As a kid he saw it as a \"boring old white man's sport,\" but his attitude changed when Tiger Woods emerged in the late 1990s.\"Golf became cool because Tiger brought a swagger to the game that wasn't there before, and his athletic ability was beyond what the game had seen before. I'm not saying he's better than Jack (Nicklaus) or Arnie (Palmer), it's just how he did it,\" Allen said.  Like Woods in his prime, the Orlando native is blessed with a powerful physique. At college he played football, volleyball, dabbled with rugby and, with a best time of 10.1 seconds, was lightning fast over 100m. Golf really wasn't anywhere on his radar until a friend challenged him to hit a ball back in 2010.WATCH: Living Golf's November show\"I hit a seven iron 230 yards and literally later that day my friend had me go to a long drive competition. I lost because, like all long drivers, I couldn't keep the ball in bounds but I was hitting it 40-50 yards further than everyone else there that day.\" From that moment he was hooked, but it's been a long, hard slog. \"I was spending anything between 10-14 hours on the driving range just trying to learn how to hit the ball, how to control the ball. It took me a while to get all that going,\" he said.\"It was very tough and I went through a lot of things. I was in chiropractic school, ended up being homeless, had to sleep in my car, on people's couches for a little while because I had this dream that I was going to be a long drive guy.\" Seven years, and thousands of buckets of balls later, Allen is a scratch golfer with a low 18-hole score of 67 and a best in-competition drive of 488 yards -- all powered by a daily intake of 5,000-7,000 calories which fuel long sessions in the gym and at the driving range.Allen can generate club-head speeds in excess of 150mph.'Cracking the whip'Long hitters like Allen are able to generate incredible power by harnessing their core strength, says Jon Wheat, professor of sport and exercise biomechanics at the UK's Sheffield Hallam University.\"In an effective golf swing, the speed is generated by the larger muscles of the body in the legs and in the trunk,\" Wheat told CNN. \"Cracking the whip gets used a lot as an analogy -- energy is transferred down the whip to the tip and that moves incredibly fast compared to the handle end. READ: Trump hails South Korea's golfing stars\"If the body moves in a very well-timed and sequential way -- legs first, then the arms, and then the trunk -- a skilled golfer is able to transfer those huge forces to the club to produce a huge club-head speed.\"Specialist long drivers swing at speeds in excess of 150mph propelling the ball into orbit at 200mph plus. Tour pros average around 110-120mph and 160-180mph respectively. The equipment is also calibrated for maximum length.\"Long drive pros play with extremely stiff graphite shafts compared to pro tour and amateur golfers,\" Wheat explains. \"That's essentially because of the swing speeds -- the torques on the golf club are so much greater, and you can get warping and twisting.\"Also, they are using much lower loft clubs in long drive and that's to control the amount of backspin on the ball. \"Long drivers tee the ball up very high and they approach the ball with a positive angle of attack, hitting upwards on the ball and that's all about trying too reduce backspin.\"JUST WATCHEDA day in the life of Joe MillerReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHA day in the life of Joe Miller 08:53READ: Golf great's mind is 'blown' by modern game's failingsDriving at growthFor most of his career Allen has plied his trade in America, but opportunities are now opening up abroad as rival competitions look to cash in on the sport's growing popularity.Next year, Allen plans to spend more time in Europe competing in the Long Drive World Series which is expanding its roster of tournaments to 10 starting in Dubai next spring.  \"It's really important that we grow Long Drive in Europe,\" Allen said. \"I think next year will be a truly breakout year for that organization.\"Golf has struggled to attract new players in recent times, and even PGA Tour CEO Peter Bevacqua admits golf has suffered from an elitist image and must adapt to changing times -- \"golf doesn't have to be a four-hour experience,\" Bevacqua told CNN earlier this year.JUST WATCHEDPGA of America CEO wants golf to be inclusiveReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPGA of America CEO wants golf to be inclusive 03:38Long drive's fast-paced format fits that bill and so does its energy, says Allen, who'd like to see a little less hat tipping and a bit more passion.\"Look at the Ryder Cup vs. any other PGA or European Tour event,\" he said. \"Those guys get amped up. When they make a good shot they get excited. When you look at them at a normal event what do they do? They hole it out from 150 yards and they tip the cap like 'I'm too cool, I do this all the time.'Visit CNN.com/golf for more news and features\"The average golfer can't get their brain around that because you or I, if we hole out from 150 yards with our friends we go bananas.

The pair appeared overjoyed as they appeared for photographers on a slightly overcast Monday afternoon in London.Markle said she was \"so very happy\" and flashed her engagement ring to reporters. The ring, designed by Harry, has a gold band and features a large diamond from Botswana and two smaller outer diamonds from the personal collection of Harry's late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, according to a statement from Kensington Palace.Read MoreBotswana holds special significance for the couple, who have spent time together there over the past year and a half, Kensington Palace said.Harry designed the engagement ring which was made by Cleave and Company, Court Jewellers and Medallists to Her Majesty The Queen. The pair, who became engaged quietly earlier this month, will marry in spring 2018 and live at Nottingham Cottage at Kensington Palace, where Harry currently lives.  Markle will be the first American to marry a British royal since the marriage of Wallis Simpson to King Edward VIII, a union so controversial that he was forced to give up the throne in December 1936 to go through with it. Monday's announcement was made by Harry's father, Prince Charles, in a statement released from his office at Clarence House. Prince Charles said he was \"delighted to announce\" the engagement, adding that Harry had informed \"The Queen and other close members of his family.\" The Prince of Wales is delighted to announce the engagement of Prince Harry to Ms. Meghan Markle. pic.twitter.com/zdaHR4mcY6\u2014 Clarence House (@ClarenceHouse) November 27, 2017\n\n\"Prince Harry has also sought and received the blessing of Ms. Markle's parents,\" the statement added.The couple went before photographers on Monday afternoon before taking part in a broadcast interview which will air in the evening.Harry's grandparents, Queen Elizabeth II and her husband Prince Philip, are \"delighted\" for the couple and \"wish them every happiness,\" a Buckingham Palace spokesman said.  The palace did not say what titles would be conferred upon the couple when they are married, but the prince is likely to be awarded a dukedom, meaning Markle would become a duchess. Markle will not become a princess in her own right: only daughters of royals can claim such status.

Monday's announcement sets the stage for the most anticipated royal wedding since William married Catherine Middleton in 2011 in a lavish ceremony at Westminster Abbey. Harry's marriage to Markle will not be the first time a British royal has wed a divorcee. The British media has previously compared Markle to Wallis Simpson, the divorced American whose relationship with King Edward VIII led to his 1936 abdication. However, there is significantly less controversy around this union given that in 2005, Prince Charles, the heir apparent to the throne and a divorcee himself, wed Camilla Parker-Bowles, who had also been married previously.Next spring was already set to be a joyous occasion for the British royal family, with William and Catherine recently announcing they are set to welcome their third child in April.",

No-one does giddy quite as well as the zealous supporter who has witnessed his or her team create history, secure a precious trophy or beat an old rival. But then there are the fans who take good times to another level. These are the lovers of the snow, the men and women who devote themselves to the ski season, following the world's best Alpine racers around Europe during the teeth-chatteringly cold winter months. Follow @cnnsport\n\nThey drink, they dance, they cheer -- on mountains, in remote Alpine towns; in the morning, in the dark, in wind, rain or snow. They are an engrossing sight.American fans cheer during a FIS Alpine World Ski Championship event.On a morning cold enough to freeze breath, snow is falling on top of the Rettenbach glacier in western Austria. Gloveless hands quickly become numb on days such as these. A strong wind is holding a row of national flags on full alert. Tiredness is blown away. Read MoreAround 14,500 fans have negotiated meandering hairpins on buses, taxis and vans to watch the best female skiers perform on the Soelden slopes for the opening race of the FIS Ski World Cup. It's the first of 20 World Cup weekends which will be held across the globe, culminating in Sweden in March. With the Winter Olympics just three months away, it's a first opportunity for skiers to test themselves against their rivals, and a chance for fans to see their heroes in action following the lengthy summer break. Fans at the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup in Schladming, Austria.Thundering musicNear the entrance, fans are scurrying to and fro. To entertain there is the skiing, and also some slapstick too as some cower and flinch at the sight of ski-carrying fans making dicey sharp turns. The majority of fans can be found near the finish line, watching racers zig-zagging down the piste, but from wherever the action is observed, thundering music -- the sort of noise that would make the crabby tut and groan -- can be heard. It is nearly loud enough to crack ice. A short distance from the course, as the first round of racing comes to a conclusion, six women appear on stage. Dressed in red ski pants and white coats, they merrily dance to hip-swinging pop tunes, encouraging their ever-growing audience to follow their lead, and many do. It's one way of keeping warm when it's -4C!Fans on the beers already. It's the coldest, most beautiful, nightclub I've been to #fisalpine pic.twitter.com/rI2MsQpEf6\u2014 Aimee Lewis (@aimeeloulewis) October 28, 2017\n\nFans are dancing on the snow and on tables, some are waving flags, ringing cowbells or blowing into plastic horns. Some sing along to the music, others link arms with friends. After all, it would be foolish to stay still when it's so bone-chilling cold. With breakfast barely digested, beer cans are raised skywards. It is one of the coldest, most beautiful, clubs in the world. Towards the bottom of the course are four shivering French fans dressed as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Their outfits are not offering much protection from the elements. Fancy dress is not unusual in these parts -- behind them are men dressed as cows, the udders crudely placed on their chest. It is one part elite sporting event, one part bachelor party.

He has switched allegiances this weekend because he supports Mikaela Shiffrin, the Colorado-born reigning World Cup champion who hoisted last year's Crystal Globe. The 39-year-old software engineer has opted for a routine ski jacket and trousers for the occasion. It is, perhaps, difficult for a man who has, for the last four years, attended most of the European-based World Cup events to find a wacky outfit for every race weekend. \"We like the atmosphere of this sport. Compared to football it's so much fun, it doesn't matter who the people support,\" he tells CNN Sport. Born admits his is an expensive hobby; he spends thousands.\"Always we're trying to be in the VIP area so a weekend will cost about \u20ac1,000-1,500 ($1,165-1,750),\" he says. \"Just last week somebody told me I'm crazy!\"A general view during the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup Women's Giant Slalom in SoeldenREAD: Vonn happy to be back a Rebensburg wins openerBut even for those who aren't ardent ski fans, it is easy to see the appeal of this good-natured atmosphere in a breathtakingly beautiful setting. It is an occasion for all the generations, though the revelry is not solely reserved for the mountains.  Photos: Skiing's speed queenThe world's greatest female ski racer Lindsey Vonn has officially retired from the sport after her final race at the World Championships in Are. Here's a look back at her glittering career. Hide Caption 1 of 18 Photos: Skiing's speed queenShe made her Olympic debut at Salt Lake City 2002 as a 17-year-old, finishing 32nd in slalom and sixth in the combined slalom/downhill event.Hide Caption 2 of 18 Photos: Skiing's speed queenLindsey Kildow -- as she was then before marrying fellow skier Thomas Vonn -- won her first World Cup race with victory in the downhill at Lake Louise, Canada, in 2004.Hide Caption 3 of 18 Photos: Skiing's speed queenIn 2005, Vonn signed with Red Bull and began working with a completely new coaching team. She seemed set for the start of something special. Hide Caption 4 of 18 Photos: Skiing's speed queenAny momentum from the new deal was slowed during the 2006 Olympics in Italy, though.

Hide Caption 9 of 18 Photos: Skiing's speed queenIn 2013, Vonn suffered an horrific crash at the World Championships in Austria. She underwent reconstructive knee surgery and began a long road to recovery. She attempted to return a year later, only to pull out of the 2014 Olympics after aggravating the injury again. Hide Caption 10 of 18 Photos: Skiing's speed queenInjuries continued to hamper Vonn. She fractured her left knee in February 2016 in a crash during a World Cup super-G race in Soldeu, Andorra, but raced the combined event the next day before calling an end to her season.Hide Caption 11 of 18 Photos: Skiing's speed queenVonn worked hard to get back in time to challenge for gold medals at the 2018 Winter Olympics. The American left PyeongChang with a bronze medal in the downhill but insisted she was proud to have made it through her injuries.Hide Caption 12 of 18 Photos: Skiing's speed queenVonn announced the current ski World Cup season would be her last. She is already the most successful woman in World Cup history with 82 victories and was chasing down Ingemar Stenmark's overall World Cup record of 86 victories in her sights. Hide Caption 13 of 18 Photos: Skiing's speed queenHowever, a knee injury from a training crash in November meant she couldn't start her season until January. On her debut in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, she was still struggling with knee pain.

She was eventually able to ski to the bottom and said she would still compete in the downhill to bring the curtain down on her glittering career. Hide Caption 16 of 18 Photos: Skiing's speed queenDespite her damaged knees, Vonn was able to retire on a positive note.

Hide Caption 18 of 18Disco lightsFriday night in the Otztal Valley and fans have gathered in the dark, congregating in a car park which has been transformed into a pop-up shindig.People in wooly hats are drinking gluhwein (a traditional Austrian hot, spiced wine), devouring schnitzels and are waiting for the main event of the night: the bib number draw for the next day's race.It's quite the show. A live band is entertaining the masses; there are disco lights, beer on tap and, as ever, the sound of cowbells ringing in the distance. By 6.30pm hundreds have gathered around the stage. They are craning their necks, waving flags (there is a lot of flag-waving on a race weekend), and watching skiers pick out from a tombola a number that will determine the order in which they will race. There is the touch of the Eurovision Song contest about this draw: two male hosts play up to the crowd, switching from German to English, depending on the nationality of the athlete in their presence. Some skiers, normally those who are yet to become household names, are told to hurry. They become the victims of the hosts' drawn-out chatter.But the major stars can take their time in the spotlight. When the 22-year-old Shiffrin makes an appearance, Stars and Stripes flags pop up like toast and the crowd's roars rise by a few decibels. The American, who loves tap dancing, is encouraged to dance for her fans. At first she is apprehensive but, with a little encouragement, her feet begin to move, then the hips and, within seconds, her arms are in the air. Shiffrin's body is now moving in unison and, buoyed, she spins. It is rare to see athletes as relaxed as this on the eve of a major competition. Thanks to Shiffrin the crowd is now yee-hawingly vocal -- there is no doubting what sport reigns supreme in this part of the world. But the end of the draw does not signal the end of the revelry. These fans will foot-stomp into the night. 'It's crazy to think they're my fan club'Ted Ligety fan club Outside one of Soelden's many ski stores are four Germans, all wearing matching red jackets with \"Push The Limit Ted\" stitched on the back.  They are members of the Ted Ligety fan club and this is their weekend uniform.Formed in Saxony in 2012 in appreciation of the two-time Olympic champion, members of this club -- whose annual membership fee is $23 (\u20ac20) -- travel around Europe to watch their favorite Alpine skier. The fan club's website says its purpose is \"promoting interest in alpine ski racing\" and to \"support the racer Ted Ligety.\" Ligety admits it is \"surreal\" to have a fan club in his name. \"Growing up I never would've thought I'd be where I am today,\" he tells CNN Sport. \"It's pretty crazy to think they travel to most of the races and they're my fan club.\"READ: How fatherhood changed everything for Ted LigetyLigety talks of the initial shock he experienced when, as a 21-year-old fresh on the circuit, he first heard supporters yell his name near the start line. \"You're never fully used to it, but now I can be more focused and not necessarily look over when someone's yelling my name,\" he says, laughing. The shouting and stomping does not go unnoticed by racers, he says. For many, the highlight of the calendar is January's annual night race in Schladming, where thousands of fans line the slopes on a floodlit winter's evening. There is Kitzbuhel too, with its iconic course and 50,000 screaming fans, and the tradition of Canadian and American racers serving post-race beer behind the bar of a local tavern, called the Londoner.\"There's definitely a party atmosphere around ski races,\" says Ligety. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news and videos\"You see it on the finish area, like Kitzbuhel -- it's a full-on party scene, people drinking hard. They get pretty raucous for sure. \"I really like it when we have those races, when there is that atmosphere. It's flattering to think people are watching your races and are super psyched to be there.\"",

They also collected donations for those affected by a deadly earthquake that struck earlier this month in a remote border area between Iran and Iraq.Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who was given a five-year sentence on espionage charges that she and her family vehemently deny, has found herself at the center of an international dispute between the UK and Iran following a mistake by British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.Johnson erroneously told a British parliamentary committee on November 1 that Zaghari-Ratcliffe was in Iran teaching journalists when she was detained in April 2016. Her family and employer have always insisted she was visiting relatives on vacation. Her young daughter, Gabriella, remains with Zaghari-Ratcliffe's parents in Iran.Read More'We want you home'The demonstrators carried two letters to the Islamic center, one an open letter written by a group of local mothers and the second written by Zaghari-Ratcliffe's own mother.Zaghari-Ratcliffe's sister-in-law, Rebecca Ratcliffe, said it was important to show local support. \"When you're a mom, it's all about your community, isn't it?\" she said. \"It's her community reaching out to her and saying, 'We care about you. We want you home.'\"Rosie Ratcliffe, the 10-year-old niece of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, calls for her release.\n \nFears have grown that Zaghari-Ratcliffe's five-year sentence could be lengthened in the wake of Johnson's mistake. She is due to appear in an Iranian court on December 10 to face charges of \"spreading propaganda,\" her husband told CNN on Thursday.\"My Christmas wish is for everyone to come back and we can be a family again,\" Rosie Ratcliffe, Gabriella's 10-year-old cousin, told CNN. \"I remember when she was little, all of our cousins would be together. ... She was very little then, she was 1, and now she's 3. She's been there for quite a long time. It's very sad.\"Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband dreams of wife's release by Christmas One local mother taking part in the protest, Charlotte Samuels, 36, said she did not know Zaghari-Ratcliffe personally but was appalled that her case had still not been resolved. The UK government should do more, she said.\"We are not related to Nazanin, we are not friends with Nazanin, we've never met, but we think that it is absolutely essential that we stand up for someone who is bullied or is being treated unfairly,\" Samuels said. \"That is what we teach our children, and it's what we should practice ourselves.\" Speaking after a meeting last week with Richard Ratcliffe, Johnson insisted the British government was doing everything in its power to free Zaghari-Ratcliffe. He is set to travel to Iran before the end of the year to meet with her.",

        "content": "(CNN)Soccer is considered one of the oldest games in history. So, it may come as a surprise that its wealthiest competition, the Premier League, is just 25 years old. On August 15, 1992, the league was founded in England as media moguls and presidents of Britain's largest football clubs, chasing better broadcasting revenues, clubbed together to create an elite championship. In 1994, then Blackburn Rovers striker Alan Shearer celebrates after his team won the league title.A quarter of a century later, clubs like Manchester United and Manchester City are valued in the billions and the Sky television network pays around $13 million to air a 90-minute match.  While ratings aren't as high this year as in previous seasons, last season the league was broadcast into 1 billion homes around the world.  Read MoreAlan Shearer, once soccer's most expensive player and now a pundit on BBC's \"Match of The Day,\" has been there since the beginning.JUST WATCHED'It's a horrible disease'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'It's a horrible disease' 05:48\"Genuinely, I think it is the best league in the world as a whole package,\" Shearer says, as he meets CNN's Talk Asia at the Hong Kong Football Club (HKFC). \"The stadiums, atmosphere, managers, players, you put all that together and the size of it is just incredible.\"It's just been a hell of a success, it really has.\"In the beginningIn 1992, Shearer started the first Premier League season as a Blackburn Rovers player, scoring 16 goals in 21 games. Since then, his name has become a synonym for success. Three years later, Rovers won the title. Shearer's 34 goals that season took one of England's minnow clubs into the glory books, in a way that was subsequently unmatched until Leicester City's famous 2016 upset win. Newcastle striker Alan Shearer celebrates after scoring in the 77th against Sunderland  on April 5, 1997. In 1996, Shearer became soccer's most expensive player when he was sold by Blackburn to  Newcastle United for \u00a315 million  ($20 million). The Newcastle-upon-Tyne-born player famously rejected an offer from Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson in favor of playing for his boyhood club.He became Newcastle's highest ever goal scorer, putting 206 balls into the net. His career haul of 260 Premier League goals is a record that remains undefeated.  Tottenham Hotspur superstar Harry Kane, 24, could surpass it, Shearer concedes. But Kane would need to keep scoring at his current rate for nine more seasons, while avoiding serious injury. Tottenham, too, would have to ward off suitors such as Real Madrid, a Spanish club with pockets deep enough to make Kane the world's most valuable soccer player.   A money gameTo understand how things have changed since 1992, you only need to look to the money changing hands for players.In 2016, French player Paul Pogba was sold by Italian club Juventus to Manchester United for \u00a396 million ($127 million).

        "content": "Story highlightsYannick Noah trying to bring Davis Cup back to FranceFrance last won the tennis team title in 2001But it hasn't all been smooth since his returnFrance plays Belgium, which is seeking a first title (CNN)Yannick Noah's latest tenure as France's Davis Cup captain hasn't been as smooth as some of the music he produces. But if France beats neighbor Belgium in the final this weekend to end a drought dating to 2001, no one will be able to argue with his results. Follow @cnnsport\n\nNoah was at the helm in 1991 when France won a first Davis Cup title in 59 years -- famously getting the best out of the talented, yet seemingly crocked and out-of-sorts Henri Leconte against Pete Sampras' US -- and was also on the bench when France captured a maiden Fed Cup title in 1997. Those accomplishments cemented his spot as a hero in France, his profile first skyrocketing when he won the French Open -- with net-rushing flair to boot -- in 1983. Despite a golden generation of players in the past decade, France still awaits a men's successor. And away from the court, Noah is indeed a veritable pop star, having released about a dozen albums and once, according to the New York Times, playing in front of 80,000 fans at the national stadium the Stade de France. But if he has legions of fans for his grooves, his popularity within France's Davis Cup squad is another matter. Frane's Davis Cup hopes largely rest on the shoulders of Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.Read MoreThere was for example visible tension between Noah and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga -- long considered the French No. 1 of the last 10 years -- in September's semifinal win over Serbia. The pair barely interacted during changeovers.  Noah's first move in his third stint as Davis Cup captain last year was to pick Guadeloupe as the site of a first-round tie against Canada and that drew the ire of Gael Monfils, who was hoping for less travel time. Monfils eventually played but is ruled out of the series against Belgium in Lille due to injury, a blow since tennis' ultimate showman was France's lone positive in a disastrous loss to Switzerland three years ago in the final in the same city. That result marked the beginning of the end for Noah's predecessor Arnaud Clement, the latter officially dismissed a year later after France lost to Great Britain in the quarterfinals. Clement sued France's tennis federation for $1.8 million early last year before the parties settled. Noah isn't sure if he will be around in 2018, no matter what happens in Lille. There is \"no certainty about anything,\" he told reporters this week. Destiny on France's side? France's path to this year's final might lead one to believe destiny is on the side of the 57-year-old and Les Bleus, however. In victories over Japan, Great Britain and Serbia, France didn't have to confront grand slam winners or finalists Kei Nishikori, Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic. But Belgium's star man David Goffin -- barring a last-minute snafu -- will be taking to the hard court at the Stade Pierre Mauroy, which housed a record tennis crowd of 27,448 on the final day of the 2014 tie and is expected to boast similar figures this weekend. Fatigue is certainly a consideration for world No. 7 Goffin since he played five matches en route to reaching the final at the World Tour Finals last weekend but the 26-year-old is bound to be supremely confident too after defeating Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal indoors in London.Goffin's late season surge began when he won both his Davis Cup matches in September's semifinals against Australia.READ: 'Baby Fed' comes of age Goffin meets friend and 18th-ranked Lucas Pouille in Friday's opening singles -- the 23-year-old Frenchman surprisingly leads their head-to-heads 3-0, having gone 4-0 in their tiebreaks -- followed by No. 15 Tsonga's tussle with Steve Darcis, whose ranking of 76th belies his performances in the Davis Cup.

Now it's just a little more clear,\" Belgium's 1997 French Open semifinalist Filip Dewulf told CNN. \"What has changed is the view from the French media, entourage, public on Goffin. \"David was always so discrete that the French, being the French, still thought in the back of their mind that Goffin was in the top 10 because of his consistency and the luck that Djokovic, Murray, and others were injured. Tsonga and Pouille would probably beat him. Now they're a lot less sure, if not scared. \"A player who beats Nadal and Federer in one week is the real deal and that kicks in a few days before things get going.\"JUST WATCHEDJack Sock's tennis sock challengeReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHJack Sock's tennis sock challenge 01:14Belgium hoping for first titleA nation known more for its female tennis players given the careers of Justine Henin and Kim Clijsters, Belgium has never won the Davis Cup but playing in the 2015 final against Great Britain with the same crop of players will help this time around, added Dewulf.    \"They had the same emotions only two years ago and should be able to use that feeling in their favor,\" said Dewulf.\"To play before 27,000 people will probably be different but the fact that they play an away tie relieves the pressure a bit. They are not supposed to win and it's always easier to be in the underdog position.\"Both captains made changes to their original pairings for Saturday's doubles. Noah drafted in Richard Gasquet -- who struggled badly in the 2014 final -- to play alongside Pierre Hugues Herbert, while Johan van Herck picked Joris de Loore over Arthur de Greef to play with Ruben Bemelmans. \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7 @lapouille and \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddea @David_Goffin will open the 2017 #DavisCupFinal!! pic.twitter.com/nYrC7Gzhwc\u2014 Davis Cup (@DavisCup) November 23, 2017\n\nDe Loore was always the first choice ahead of De Greef, the lone issue being a knee injury. If the tie goes to a decider, look out for Darcis. The man nicknamed the \"Shark\" holds a 22-9 record in the Davis Cup and is a perfect 5-0 in 'live' fifth matches after beating Jordan Thompson in the semifinals.So will Noah's magic touch disappear?  Visit CNN.com/sport for the latest news and features\"I'm convinced that the French will feel the pressure,\" said Dewulf. \"The players are seen as the golden generation but have, in the eyes of the media, not lived up to the expectations from the public and press. They will be reminded of that a number of times. \"I don't feel like there's really a good connection between players and French journalists while everyone on the Belgian side is pulling for the Belgian team. And in the eyes of the general public this is a golden opportunity against a small country like Belgium. \"They are just not allowed to lose, and that's never an easy position to be in.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Germany's Social Democrats will meet next week with Chancellor Angela Merkel's alliance in a bid to break the country's post-election political deadlock, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier announced Friday morning.The parties' leaders will meet at Steinmeier's official residence in Berlin to discuss \"the situation after the breakdown of the coalition talks.\"The announcement comes five days after the collapse of negotiations between Merkel's alliance of the Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union, the pro-business Free Democrats and the Green Party and marks a significant retreat from the Social Democratic Party's (SPD) earlier refusal to enter talks with Merkel or to seek a renewal of the so-called grand coalition of the past four years.Indications of a shift came when SPD General Secretary Hubertus Heil told reporters late Thursday that the party \"is convinced that discussions must be held... the SPD will not rule out talks.\"His cautious language was echoed on Friday morning by SPD deputy leader Manuela Schwesig, who said that a new coalition government was no certainty.Read More\"Just because one says that one is open to talks, that doesn't automatically mean a conversation about a grand coalition and even less a vote for a grand coalition,\" she told public broadcaster ZDF.Merkel's alliance and the SPD suffered significant losses in September's federal election. After Martin Schulz, the SPD's leader, ruled out another grand coalition -- citing the need to rebuild his party and an unwillingness to leave the far-right Alternative for Germany as the largest opposition group in Parliament -- few viable coalition options remained.READ MORE: What next for Germany as Merkel myth implodes?President Steinmeier met with Social Democratic Party leader Martin Schulz on Thursday to discuss the country's next steps.On Monday, less than 24 hours after the discussions broke down, Schulz repeated his refusal to enter talks, arguing that \"the grand coalition got the red card\" in September's elections and suggesting his party was open to new elections instead.Although some party members publicly backed Schulz, others questioned his hardline stance.Schulz has also come under fire from CDU politicians who consider a new grand coalition a better option than a minority government or new elections -- both unprecedented in postwar Germany.Frank-Walter Steinmeier: Can Germany's 'anti-Trump' end Merkel's political crisis?\"The SPD must now consider whether it is going to remain maliciously in the corner, as we've seen in the last days and weeks, or whether it wants to take responsibility for this country and for Europe,\" CDU lawmaker Jens Spahn said Monday.But if the SPD does begin official talks with Merkel and her alliance, it's unlikely Schulz will have the backing of his whole party.Just a few hours before Heil addressed the press, Heiko Maas, an SPD parliamentarian and Germany's justice minister, argued against a renewed CDU/SPD coalition on ZDF's political talk show \"maybrit illner.\"\"It is not the SPD that is responsible for this situation,\" he said. \"We are not Mrs. Merkel's 'German Life Saving Association', always heading out to save her from drowning.\"Maas did acknowledge, however, that talks were likely to happen and said that avoiding them entirely would be \"childish\".",

Qualified vet Chatfield-Roberts beat Owen on board Golden Wedding\"It was a great thrill to get past the winning post at Ascot in front,\" said Chatfield-Roberts. \"The race was good fun, but we went a little quicker than I'm used to. It was a great experience and a day I will never forget.\"Owen said he had \"the time of my life\" at Ascot on FridayTough trainingTrying to control a sizable animal that can reach speeds of 40 miles per hour places huge demands on the human body and training has been tough for Owen, who was never allowed to get on a horse during his football career due to the risk of injury.He lost more than a stone in weight since he started training in March and, earlier this month, was thrown to the ground twice at Newmarket's British Racing School.Owen had never been on a horse before March, 2017Owen training on board Calder Prince the day before the raceHowever, none of that put him off and he chose a lively horse for the big day, Calder Prince, trained by Tom Dascombe, who is the resident trainer at Owen's Manor House Stables which he established in 2007.\"Calder Prince gives me the best chance of winning, and this was never just about taking part,\" joked Owen, who was crowned European Footballer of the Year in 2001 when he was a striker at Liverpool, before going on to play for Real Madrid, Newcastle United, Manchester United and Stoke City. Owen had to lose more than a stone in weight for the race\"Having said that, I realize just crossing the line will be an achievement,\" added Owen, who announced himself on football's global stage with a stunning solo goal against Argentina in the 1998 World Cup. \"It has been a big learning curve.\" \"Riding sometimes looks easy but having tried it myself I realize that it's just the jockeys making it look straightforward.

They've had 599 domestic flat race winners to date, and plenty of success abroad too, most notably Brown Panther, who took the Irish St Leger and the $1 million Dubai Gold Cup.Owen celebrates Brown Panther's Dubai Gold Cup win in 2015.Dascombe told CNN he's been impressed by how the footballer-turned-jockey has prepared himself.\"It's been a smooth transition from having never having sat on a horse before, to getting into the situation we're at now,\" he said.Owen has lost more than a stone in weight for the race.\"Michael's done remarkably well, he's had a couple of tumbles, but he's got back up and got on with it.\"\"To put it into context, I've been riding ponies since I was four and it was still a massive challenge to ride in a race at 19, having had 15 years experience of riding and five years working at a professional racing yard, and he's done it in five months.\"Owen had not sat on a horse before March of 2017.At five foot 7 inches, Owen is the same height at British flat champion jockey, Silvestre de Souza, but Dascombe joked that the former football could never have been a professional rider because \"he wouldn't do the weight.\"Flat jockeys in the UK cannot be any lighter than 53 kg (116.8 lbs) but, the closer to the weight they can be the better to lessen the load carried by the horse.Owen has been thrown off twice in training for this race.'I know I'm stupid'Owen has not ruled out racing again but he is well aware of the dangers involved. In 2004, his wife Louise fell off a horse while riding in the grounds of their home and was lucky to escape with just a fractured pelvis. \"I know I'm stupid,\" Owen told the Daily Express newspaper. \"I'd probably had a couple of drinks when I agreed to do it. And my mum is still beside herself and telling me not to dot it and my wife is saying 'what are you doing?'\"Olympic track cyclist Victoria Pendleton switched to a different kind of saddle last year.Visit CNN.com/sport for more stories & featuresIt's certainly dangerous but at least Owen was racing on the flat, unlike Britain's former Olympic champion track cyclist, Victoria Pendleton, who rode over the jumps at last year's Cheltenham Festival.Despite falling in her debut race a few weeks before, she held her nerve to finish fifth out of 24 runners in the Foxhunter Chase on board Pacha Du Polder, which resulted in one of the biggest cheers on Gold Cup day.",

The Briton has always looked forward to his bread and butter, of course. Grand Prix weekends will always set the pulse racing. But it is his morning routine which has been transformed. Breakfast has never been so mouthwateringly tasty. Follow @cnnsport\n\n\"I used to get to my summer or winter break and the first thing I'd do when I arrived in the morning was have a stack of pancakes,\" Hamilton tells CNN's The Circuit. \"It's exciting when you've gone the whole year not having them, but now I'm having them every weekend and they still taste amazing. Read More\"It's crazy. I'm not putting more weight on because, with this new plant-based diet, I can have more carbs which is contradictory of what you'd normally have thought diet-wise, but I'm not going to complain, I love pancakes so it's great.\"READ: Mental strength key to historic fourth title - Hamilton READ: Hamilton has 'come of age'JUST WATCHED'It's crazy that I have four world titles'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'It's crazy that I have four world titles' 03:36It was in September that Hamilton revealed that, for health and environmental reasons, he was to become a vegan, removing all animal-based products -- meat, seafood, dairy, even honey -- from his diet. There were those who questioned this mid-season lifestyle change. They talked of the potential harm to his \"racing edge,\" of a possible drop in testosterone, and of protein, iron and Vitamin D deficiency, all nutrients which meat easily provides. But such a dietary change during the F1 campaign did not do the 32-year-old any harm. Two months after announcing his switch, Hamilton won the world title, creating history in the process by becoming the first Briton to win four F1 world titles. Far from being a negative, the new diet has made Hamilton feel, he says, \"better than ever.\"\"I feel amazing. It's the best I've ever felt in my life,\" Hamilton says.\"Physically I feel the best I've ever felt. I feel incredibly clean and healthy.\"Poor nutrition can be catastrophicThe Briton has said he had decided to change his diet after watching a documentary about the meat industry and its potential effects on the environment, animal welfare and human health. Many studies have been conducted on the impact the livestock sector has on global greenhouse gas emissions -- an assessment by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations indicated it exceeded that of transportation.A large amount of methane and nitrous oxide are generated through livestock-raising activities.READ: Go vegan, save the planetREAD: English team is the 'world's first vegan football club'READ: Are Germans leading a vegan revolution?There is also plenty of evidence to support the health benefits of a plant-based diet.Followed correctly, it tends to contain oodles of fiber, antioxidants, potassium, magnesium and vitamins A, C and E, while it is also a diet low in saturated fat, which can reduce heart disease by lowering cholesterol and blood pressure. A study carried out by the Vegan Society, which was formed in 1944, found that the number of vegans in Britain had grown by 360% in the last 10 years, with some 542,000 people aged 15 or over adopting a plant-based diet. It has never been easier to be vegan and though Hamilton is not the first sportsperson to go meat free -- tennis greats Serena and Venus Williams became vegans in 2012 -- it is still rare for elite athletes to solely follow such a diet. Hollywood celebrities such as Jennifer Lopez, Ellen DeGeneres and Brad Pitt may enthusiastically talk of the virtues of veganism, but they do not rely on their athletic prowess to fuel their greatness. it is not essential to their trade that their bodies be machine-like in efficiency. For elite athletes poor nutrition is catastrophic. Too little protein and the mind will start to lose focus when speed of thought is of the essence, too many carbohydrates and the body may begin to slow under the weight of the extra brawn. Tofu is a good source of protein for vegans.For those striving for sporting perfection, every nutrient has a purpose, every calorie must be accounted for. But discipline and focus is part of an athlete's habitual routine which is why nutritionist Tara Ostrowe, a consultant for top athletes and teams -- she worked with French Ligue 1 champions Monaco last season -- says it is possible for elite athletes to get all the nutrients they need from a vegan diet. \"He needs to be extra disciplined ... it sometimes makes it a little bit more difficult being a vegan athlete,\" Ostrowe tells CNN Sport, reflecting on the dietary challenges potentially faced by Hamilton and other vegan athletes.\"Racing is both physically and mentally demanding so he needs to make sure he's getting top nutrition to obtain peak performance in the car and that he's following good recovery practices. \"He has to be careful that he's meeting his protein needs, but he can absolutely get that in his diet, as long as he's making some good choices.\"     Protein, a macronutrient commonly found in animal products, is essential to building muscle mass and is particularly important after exercise when muscles are receptive to protein synthesis. Someone who exerts as much energy as the 1.74m Hamilton needs, according to Ostrowe, around 1.4g of protein per kilogram of bodyweight, which equates to 95g of protein a day. Those of us who do not follow Hamilton's lung-busting training routines will need about 0.8-1.0g of protein per kilo. While 251g of steak would have given Hamilton 62g of protein, 248g of tofu only provides 20g of protein and 200g of chickpeas has about 39g of protein. His dietary change will have given him plenty of food for thought. \"If his protein sources are low, I'd recommend a protein shake 30 minutes after training. That is something I'd recommend for vegan athletes anyway,\" says Ostrowe.For a man whose annual income makes him, according to Forbes, the 10th highest-paid sportsperson of 2017, it is perhaps easier for Hamilton to adjust to this lifestyle change than most thanks to the nutritional and training advice at his disposal. But there are potential pitfalls, even for multimillionaire vegans (The Sunday Times reports that the Briton has a \u00a3131 million [$174 million] fortune).Iron deficiency can be a problem for many athletes, be they carnivores or vegans. \"Animal protein is a high source of iron so he needs to make sure when he has iron-rich food he combines it with food rich in vitamin C food because that helps with absorption of the iron from non-meat sources,\" says Ostrowe.\"For example, if he's having oatmeal in the morning, then he needs to add strawberries or blueberries to help with the absorption.\"Every single day he would need to take additional multi-vitamins. In a vegan athlete, vitamin D -- which plays a huge role in a lot of body functions -- and calcium tend to be difficult to get and B12, crucial in the formation of red blood cells, is very difficult to get.\"JUST WATCHEDThe Baja 1000: \ufeffAn unforgettable race adventure\ufeffReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH (15 Videos)The Baja 1000: \ufeffAn unforgettable race adventure\ufeffMax Verstappen on becoming Formula 1 World ChampionChristian Horner: Red Bull aren't the favorites for F1 titleNASCAR champion Kyle Larson experiences the lowest-lows and the highest-highsValtteri Bottas: F1 title race will go down to the wireLewis Hamilton on the US Grand Prix and championing change off the trackPecco Bagnaia: MotoGP's rising Italian starTeen off-road racer proves herself in male-dominated sportMonaco Grand Prix to be cut to three-day format in 2022, says F1 CEOCharles Leclerc on Ferrari, Euro 2020 and Cristiano RonaldoMick Schumacher on the 'big privilege' to carry his legendary surname into F1Stephanie Travers: From Zimbabwe to an F1 podiumLife after seeing death: Romain Grosjean's journey back to racingSebastian Vettel on whether he ever considered walking away from F1Max Verstappen: Red Bull star aims for back-to-back podiums in BahrainDr Rob Child, a performance biochemist who has worked with F1 teams McLaren and Ferrari, told the BBC that a vegan diet reduces free testosterone levels, a hormone which contributes to aggression, a must-have trait for drivers competing in a sport where even a hundredth of a second matters. \"For Lewis, he's probably taking in a lot of healthy fat to be able to make that testosterone,\" says Ostrowe.\"In terms of the normal individual, there are a lot of mixed reviews out there in terms of how the vegan diet can affect testosterone. If you're getting the right nutrition and, again, getting those healthy fats in then I don't think there's that much impact.\"Healthy fats, usually monounsaturated and polyunsaturated, are also good for heart health and supply plenty of omega-3 fatty acids, essential for brain function and cell growth. A man who puts himself under draining gravitational forces needs an efficient cardiovascular system to counter the stress. Competing in countries such as Malaysia and Singapore will also add to the heat and humidity of the cockpit. With his fourth world title, Hamilton established himself as the greatest British racing driver of all time.\"As a racing driver, to be heart healthy is really important because the heart rate goes up so much during driving and following a vegan diet is very heart healthy,\" says Ostrowe. \"Avocados, walnuts, olives, flaxseeds, chia seeds or pumpkin seeds are full of healthy fats.\"Hamilton has himself said that his on-the-go lifestyle has made his new diet taxing at times. During the F1 season, held from March to November, drivers will compete in 20 races in 20 countries. \"Some [countries] don't understand what a vegan is,\" he tells CNN's The Circuit.     \ud83d\udda4 A post shared by Lewis Hamilton (@lewishamilton) on Oct 10, 2017 at 1:35pm PDT \"It's not easy, particularly I would say more so on the road and I'm on the road all the time.\"What makes traveling more challenging for vegan athletes is the need to eat regularly. There can be no running out of steam during a high-intensity workout or in the 56th lap of a 61-lap race. But, again, the burden of eating on the go may not weigh heavily on Hamilton's shoulders. It is easy to travel in style when you own a private jet. Ostrowe, who recommends that the Briton takes snacks with him when traveling, says: \"Maybe a vegan diet takes an extra bit of planning, but any athlete needs to be on top of their diet so I don't think it takes too much extra effort at all.\"He would need to eat every two to four hours to make sure his blood sugar levels are steady.\"Staying fit and lean is super important for a racing driver and eating every two to four hours keeps the metabolism running efficiently for weight management, as well as energy and focus. He also needs to make sure he's hydrating well because flying is very dehydrating. \"Lewis needs somewhere around four-and-a-half liters of water per day, making sure he's getting those electrolytes. He will be sweating a lot in the car and he needs to make sure he's replenishing those electrolytes and fluids.\" JUST WATCHEDHow beet juice could win the Champions LeagueReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHow beet juice could win the Champions League 02:47On the back of his success this season, on his elevation to a racing great, will other sports superstars follow Hamilton down the road from which he says there is no return? \"Once you cross the line, once you go over that hill, I can't imagine going back,\" Hamilton tells The Circuit.Hamilton's conversion to veganism was a gradual process. He cut out red meat two years ago, then decreased his intake of white meat until removing animal-based products from his diet entirely.

        "content": "(CNN)Just over a year ago, Frank-Walter Steinmeier was nominated for the job of German President. \"My joy at the task is great,\" he said in an acceptance speech in Berlin.But not everyone was happy.Some doom-mongers grumbled that Steinmeier was much too important for him to be \"consigned to the periphery of power.\"After all, as Torben Luetjen and Lars Geiges wrote in their biography of Steinmeier, German presidents \"don't really have to make many decisions.\"That all changed on Monday.Read MoreWhat next for Germany as Merkel myth implodes?After coalition talks to form a new government unexpectedly collapsed late on Sunday, dealing a blow to longtime Chancellor Angela Merkel, it was President Steinmeier -- a man more accustomed to unveiling monuments than dirtying his hands with parliamentary politics -- who was given the unenviable task of restoring order. This week he's meeting with five party leaders, urging them to restart talks -- or begin new ones. If they refuse, Steinmeier is the man who could set the country on a complicated path to new elections -- unprecedented in post-war German history.\"Courage is the lifeblood of democracy,\" he said in his first speech as President in March this year. He'll need plenty of that in the days and weeks ahead.So who is Frank-Walter Steinmeier?The pragmatic bureaucratSteinmeier's journey from a working-class home in northwest Germany -- his father was a carpenter and his mother a factory worker -- to the office of the President is a remarkable one.But he's otherwise unremarkable, according to Luetjen. \"There's nothing extraordinary about him ... He's usually described as someone rather dull.\"Steinmeier's first foray into politics came in 1991 when he took a job with Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder -- state president at the time and later German Chancellor -- and was soon running his office.According to Luetjen, Steinmeier quickly began to fit the mold of a typical German bureaucrat.As German Foreign Minister, Steinmeier supported Barack Obama's bid for the presidency and the two men worked closely together. Steinmeier has spoken much less favorably about President Trump. His two stints as Foreign Minister -- during which he tackled a military crisis in Ukraine, Greece's financial meltdown and unprecedented levels of refugee arrivals to Europe and was instrumental in negotiating the nuclear deal with Iran -- only confirmed that impression. He may not be \"overly exciting,\" as Luetjen admits, but he's pragmatic, patient and rarely fazed.\"He's good at finding deals and talking to all sides,\" says Luetjen. \"Now that we have this situation -- close to a constitutional crisis -- those are talents that are really needed.\"The deal makerSteinmeier's nomination as President came as a surprise to many. He's a man who \"enjoyed real power,\" Luetjen explains. In the aftermath of the Second World War, the previously powerful role of President became largely ceremonial.He or she is the public face of the nation, a German ambassador to the world. When Steinmeier speaks, people listen.But he's not known as a great speaker. And \"he didn't seem comfortable with becoming a public figure\" at the start of his presidency, Luetjen says.On Tuesday, Steinmeier met with Christian Lindner, leader of the Free Democrats and the man who announced his party's withdrawal from coalition talks Sunday night. He believes that Steinmeier -- the deal maker, the man who \"likes to get things done\" -- will be embracing the challenge of restoring order in the currently chaotic German political landscape.\"Now he's back, doing real politics,\" Luetjen says.What are his chances of success?Luetjen and Geiges describe Steinmeier as the \"master of anti-chaos.\" \"If anyone can (make a breakthrough), then it's him,\" says Luetjen. \"Yes, I think he's capable of doing this.\"Making a brief statement from his official residence on Monday afternoon, Steinmeier had the aura of a disapproving school principal admonishing a group of unruly students.He urged all parties to come to the table and refused to entertain the possibility of fresh elections -- the option favored by Merkel and Martin Schulz, leader of Steinmeier's own Social Democratic Party. \"I expect everyone to be willing to negotiate to make it possible to form a government in the foreseeable future,\" he said. Responsibility can't simply be \"handed back to the voters.\"Despite their different party allegiances, Steinmeier has worked closely with Chancellor Angela Merkel since 2005 and they share a pragmatic, cautious approach to politics.For all his caution and composure, Steinmeier does not mince his words. Three months before Donald Trump was elected US President, Steinmeier (then foreign minister) described him as a \"hate preacher.\"And speaking just after Trump's election, Steinmeier made no attempt to disguise his deep disappointment. \"Nothing will be easier (now),\" he said, \"lots will be more difficult.\"He has even been described in the German media as the \"anti-Trump.\" Steinmeier has spoken out strongly against the rise of populism in Germany too, embodied in the far-right party Alternative for Germany (AfD), which entered the federal Parliament for the first time in September's election, winning 12.6% of the vote.Despite the country's history, Germany is not immune to populism and the damage it does to democracy, Steinmeier warned in March.With Merkel partly to blame for the AfD's recent success -- according to some German politicians -- and weakened by a poor election result and failed coalition talks, Steinmeier is the \"most stable figure in German politics right now,\" according to Luetjen.\"He's the last survivor of a generation. And he might be the right federal president at the right time.\"Correction: This story has been updated to correct a direct quote that misstated Steinmeier's title.",

        "content": "(CNN)Hillary Clinton is on stage addressing the media, telling her audience she will take their questions when, mid-sentence, she yells: \"Oh no, my period!\" Seconds later, in a manic high-pitched voice, Clinton, then the US Secretary of State, declares that her country should \"nuke\" England. It's an unfortunate turn of events. Five years on and Queen Elizabeth II and her subjects are, thankfully, still alive and well. The big red button was never pressed, of course, as the on-screen meltdown was a scene in the American sitcom \"30 Rock.\" The show's creator, Tina Fey, was mocking the perceived effect menstruation has on women. But periods can be a problem.Follow @cnnsport\n\nFor elite athletes, gaining a better understanding of menstruation could be the difference between success and failure, be the difference between competing with confidence or competing with dread.           Read MoreTo help athletes and coaches gain a better grasp of how the menstrual cycle can affect training, performance and well-being, a PhD student in England has helped develop what has been described as a groundbreaking new app.  Launched in Boston this summer, the FitrWoman app has been downloaded all around the world, from Australia to the US and the Middle East. Co-creator Georgie Bruinvels describes the creation as a \"no excuses app.\"\"It provides people with an understanding and solutions about what they can do to reduce the impact [of the menstrual cycle],\" Bruinvels, an elite runner who won the Manchester marathon in her first attempt at the distance, tells CNN Sport. By inputting typical cycle length, period duration and the date of their last period, the app will calculate where the user is in their cycle and give daily, tailored, information on their physiology -- what is happening to their body as a result of changes in their hormone levels -- and also provide training and nutritional suggestions to reflect these changes. How much of an impact could such information have on an elite athlete's performance? In a world where coaches are ever searching for small, incremental improvements, it could be significant.READ: Sport and menstruation: periods stop play?READ: How do women handle their periods in space?READ: What are your period options? Periods are often described as the \"last taboo\" in women's sport. Though sportswomen have talked openly about menstruation in recent years it is only, says Bruinvels, a \"handful\" who speak out.\"People are starting to talk about it more, which is great, but no-one is really doing anything about it,\" Bruinvels says. \"What can we do to help athletes?\"According to BBC News, around 200 million people worldwide have downloaded period-tracking apps, some of the most popular are Clue, Glow and iPeriod Period Tracker, but FitrWoman focuses on maximizing sporting performance during the monthly cycle. The FitrWoman app aims to help athletes train betterBruinvels, a full-time sports scientist and researcher for the Irish sports and data company Orreco, developed the app with Grainne Conefrey, Orreco's product development manager. Ultimately, the sports enthusiasts are on a mission to pass on all that they have learned so that the prospect of young girls ditching sport, whatever their level, during puberty is diminished. But, so far, the app's main influence has been on the training and nutritional habits of elite and recreational athletes.Bruinvels' research paper on \"Sports, exercise and the menstrual cycle,\" published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, serves as the foundation of the app's expertise. Bruinvels and Conefrey also sent questionnaires to over 1,800 elite and recreational athletes to help gain a greater understanding of the impact menstruation has on performance.  From the questionnaires, the pair found that the menstrual cycle affected the training and performance of more than half of the elite athletes questioned, while it also impacted a third of the recreational athletes.An example of the information available on FitrWoman \"During my research, I was finding more interesting information around the menstrual cycle,\" says Bruinvels.  \"How it can affect performance and what can be done to reduce that, and what caution should be applied at certain times of the month.\"Athletes train for every eventuality, but they don't train for their menstrual cycle.\"I know an athlete who competed in the Sydney Olympics and she said she came on her period the night before the race, because tapering, which is a reduction in training before big races, and flying can bring on a period. She was so underprepared that she didn't know what to do.\"Curse or myth?In 2015, British athlete Heather Watson blamed \"girl things\" on her first-round defeat at the Australian Open, while two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova has said periods could be \"difficult\" for females on the tennis tour. British long jumper Jazmine Sawyer, who uses the FitrWoman app, pulled out of a competition in Boston this year because of period pain and, a few years ago, British middle-distance runner Jessica Judd admitted that her running times could vary by 15 seconds depending on what stage she is at in her cycle.Paula Radcliffe is still the women's marathon world record holder.But periods, though still clouded in euphemism, are certainly not a curse. Paula Radcliffe first broke the women's marathon world record in Chicago in 2002 on the first day of her period, though she did experience stomach cramps during the final third of the race. A recent study, published in the journal Behavioral Neuroscience, found that women's cognitive performance, specifically memory, attention and cognitive bias, was not altered by the hormonal changes which happen during the menstrual cycle.But, in elite sport, research on the impact periods have on different athletes is limited. However, there is evidence to suggest women could be more susceptible to injury at different points of their monthly cycle as tendons and ligaments become lax and elastic around the time of ovulation, due to oestrogen levels being at their peak. Anne Keothavong is a former British No.1 tennis player.Anne Keothavong's tennis career was one troubled by knee injuries sustained when the former top-50 player was menstruating. Adapting training regimes could prevent injuries, says Bruinvels.\"Risk of injuries, like anterior-cruciate ligament or other soft tissue ligaments, is increased when oestrogen levels are high just before ovulation,\" she explains. \"When you have high levels of oestrogen, it means stability is affected. \"The most important thing is understanding. They need to have physiological awareness of why. There are certain times of the month when you are stronger so you can lift heavy weights, but there are certain times, to get the same benefits, you don't have to lift those heavy weights. \"The best thing we've had is athletes saying 'if only we had your app, we wouldn't have the injury problems I have now.' \"The injury risk is huge, especially in team sports like football and rugby.\"Women do not always have to lift heavy weights, says Brunivels, to get maximum benefit from training.If athletes train smarter, focusing on endurance when oestrogen and progesterone levels are starting to increase, switching to high intensity and resistance routines when oestrogen is high and progesterone is low just before ovulation, then, says Bruinvels, the risk of injury will decrease. As well as giving information on when to lift or stretch or run, the app also informs users about what to eat and when -- iron and carbohydrates during menstruation, for example, healthy fats towards the end of the cycle.Heat and humidity can affect an athlete during her period, too, because hormonal imbalance can cause the body's core temperature to slightly rise. But there are solutions: hydrating before and during exercise, and drinking sodium-based electrolyte drinks to make sure the fluid is absorbed. Whey shakes and fish oils, says the app, can reduce anxiety and stress during a period, while it advises users to eat protein with every meal during menstruation: \"Protein and slow carbohydrates will help maintain your energy levels, stabilize blood sugars and reduce cravings.\"\"When you're pre-menstrual your blood sugar is more likely to fluctuate so we recommend foods to counter that and eating regularly,\" Bruinvels explains. Learning to train like womenHormonal fluctuation makes it more complex to study women rather than men.During a typical 28-day cycle, a woman's hormone levels will change daily, which is why it was historically men, rather than women, who were tested for medical research. \"Around the time of the first and second world wars, due to potential harm to unborn fetuses, it was decided that research should be done on men and not women,\" explains Bruinvels.\"More latterly, it's been appreciated that women are different and that women have cyclical hormonal fluctuation, making them more complex to study than men, and way more expensive. \"Typically, when research is conducted in women, it'll be when they're bleeding, which is when their hormone levels are low and therefore most similar to men, or on women who are on the contraceptive pill, or studies just ignore the menstrual effects and don't consider it at all, which is catastrophic.\"It is still, it seems, a man's world. JUST WATCHEDWomen talk: Paging 'Aunt Flo'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWomen talk: Paging 'Aunt Flo' 01:07During a recent lecture before around 400 tennis coaches, Bruinvels was shocked to learn the largely male crowd did not know about the physiological differences between men and women. It led Bruinvels to ask: what if these male coaches helped women train like women? Would, she wondered, more world records be broken if everyone was better informed, if training was smarter?After all, only an athlete at ease with herself and her \"invisible troubles\" has the bombast to train and perform like a great. \"Men and women are very different. Physiologically they're different, they shouldn't train the same,\" she says.\"I would say men are keen to learn, but where do they find that information? How do they access it?\"Some of the coaches said they already change the training to the girls' needs, but they don't really know how or what that looks like.\"We have a coach who we work with regularly and he would say how one of his athletes would have two days every month where she couldn't compete. It was just accepted. The need for understanding from the coach's perspective is huge and that's the biggest thing that's been highlighted.\"Data, drinking, eating -- influencing performanceBruinvels and Conefrey's app is still in its infancy and so to help with development they have been working closely with Celtic Women's football team. Currently half the Glaswegian team's squad use the app, with the club's sports scientists keeping a close eye on results. Some members of Celtic Women's football team have been using FitrWoman.\"It gives the players autonomy,\" Andrew Wiseman, Celtic Women's athletic development coach, tells CNN Sport. \"We very much encourage them to take the reins. It makes them more aware of the influence of the cycle on performance. \"Performance is such a big thing. There are so many factors that can influence it. It certainly has had its benefits for us. Before the app, I'd just blamed work for everythingCeltic Women's captain Kelly Clark\"We collect data every day. If I was to look back over two or three months of data and can't work out why that person isn't performing, if we can't pinpoint anything, we do now have an alternative and we'll ask that player: can we have a look if you're using the app.\"Since using the app, Celtic Women's captain Kelly Clark, a trainee accountant, has noticed she has more energy to perform after a day in the office. \"Before the app, I'd just blame work for everything,\" she tells CNN Sport. \"I'd just think to myself 'I've worked hard this week so maybe that's why I feel tired.' I didn't think it could be anything to do with the menstrual cycle. It's reassuring at times to know that that's probably the way I should be feeling. \"There was one day at work when I drank two liters of water throughout the day, but I was still thirsty. I didn't understand why so I checked the app and it said 'make sure you drink enough water today.' That day it was so on-point that I began to take it more seriously. \"I've never focused on hydration and nutrition as much as I do now and this season is the fittest I've been. It could be down to the app, it could be down to training, but it's probably a combination of both.\"Clark admits that menstruation is still a subject the squad rarely talks about, although teammates with history of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries have spoken of the benefits of having an easily accessible reference point. You don't want to go into that quarterfinal thinking 'oh crap, I'm on my period'Orreco's product development manager Grainne Conefrey\"For the players who had done their ACLs, the app reassured them that they could really push themselves in training. It really helped mentally,\" says the Scot. \"Because football is a team sport you can't completely change training sessions for one person. But if it's proven that during certain times of the month you need to be more careful, we should all have access to that information. \"In football especially, there are a lot of male coaches and it's an area they don't want to speak about, but this information has probably forced that upon them.\"What next for Bruinvels and Conefrey? They have already embarked on the second part of their project, asking more questions to hundreds of women, making plans to update the app to accommodate the fresh information at their disposal.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news and videos\"We've lots of plans,\" Conefrey tells CNN Sport, her eyes widening. \"This is just our first version of it. It's about sharing information and giving it to a wider audience. We want to build an app that takes everything into account for the female athlete and will then generate its own data. \"We asked the question whether anyone altered their training and nutrition and the answer was 'no.' Then we asked do they want to and the answer was 'yes.' But if you Google it, there's no information on how to do this. \"You don't want to go into that quarterfinal thinking 'oh crap, I'm on my period'. I definitely want to change that mindset.\"",

About 50% of it is used once and then discarded, and 91% never recycled.\"We've created this problem for our planet and unless we actively do something about it or stop using it or make manufacturing change it's only going to get worse,\" says the 44-year-old Caffari. The 2016 report by the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the EMF said that if this trend continues at the same rate, there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean (by weight) by 2050.Britains' Prince Charles told delegates at the recent Our Ocean summit in Malta it was crucial to create a circular economy that allows plastics to be \"recovered, recycled and reused instead of created, used and then thrown away.\"READ: Plastic island -- How our throwaway culture is turning paradise into graveyardREAD: The plastic plague -- can our oceans be saved?

These come from sources such as cosmetics, clothing and industrial processes as well as the breakdown of larger plastic items. Fish, other sealife and birds mistake it for food. In turn, this plastic enters the human food chain and is ingested by us.  \"Plastic is on the menu,\" warned Prince Charles in his speech in Malta.  To collect new data, Caffari's team will take water samples each day as they race 45,000 miles around the world in 11 legs across four oceans.The exact location of each sample will be pinpointed by GPS and the results analyzed to build up a global map of micro-plastic concentration levels in the oceans.     \"This real data has to be acted up on,\" says Caffari. \"We often pay lip service to a lot of things, but hopefully this will be proactive and make change happen.\" Photos: The plastic age Plastic pollution in our oceans \u2013 Some researchers estimate there will be more plastic than fish in our oceans by the year 2050.

        "content": "Story highlightsGreg Norman isn't impressed by standard of players' short game\"Their distance control is not consistent,\" says golf greatIn 2016, Greg Norman gave CNN's cameras rare access to his prized golf room at his estate in Florida. Some of his clubs date back to the 1970s, and many were made by Norman himself. (CNN)It's hard to imagine any of today's top professional golfers hunkered in a workshop making their own golf clubs. Rewind a couple of decades though and that's exactly what former world no.1 Greg Norman used to do,  before he headed out to compete on the PGA Tour.Follow @cnnsport\n\n\"I used to hand make all my equipment, assemble my shafts, weigh up my grips, get the spine angles of my shafts exactly the same for every iron shot so you get absolute consistency with performance of your shaft,\"  the 62-year-old Norman told CNN Sport over the phone earlier this month from his office in West Palm Beach, Florida.With that in mind, you can perhaps understand why Norman was baffled by the recent revelation that US Ryder Cup star Patrick Reed had failed to notice he'd been playing with the wrong club set-up.Reed's approach-play statistics had taken a dramatic dip before he eventually discovered that his irons had been off by as much as 2 to 2.5 degrees, something Norman believes would never have happened to him or his contemporaries.Read MorePatrick Reed's form dipped because his club set up was wrong.\"We knew our games so well, we knew our equipment so well,\" said Norman. \"Then today you read about stuff like Patrick Reed. How the hell can you take a brand new set of golf clubs out on to the course without even knowing that the lie angle was bad, the divots, the ball flight or anything. \"That blows my mind and he's a top player.\" Greg Norman was one of the biggest hitters on the PGA Tour in his prime.'Amazingly poor'Today's pros hit the ball further than ever before but Norman is also \"amazed\" how poor some of them are at the shorter stuff.Nicknamed \"The Great White Shark,\" Norman was known for his aggressive, big hitting style during the 1980s and 1990s, but it was his consistency that kept him top of the sport for so long.And it's that consistency which the Australian feels is lacking among the current crop of professionals, especially when it comes to their short game. Norman prided himself on distance control.\"If you look at today's top players, their distance control inside 150 yards with a wedge is quite amazingly poor,\" he said.\"These guys are 20 feet short, 30 feet left, 20 feet long, their distance control is not consistent. It could just be the way they play -- when it works, it works and when it doesn't, it doesn't.\"In our era, every time you'd put a pitching wedge in your hand, if you didn't think you'd get the ball inside 10 feet every time, or seven out of 10 times, you weren't having any control over your golf game.\"Lexi Thompson led the LPGA Tour in driving accuracy and greens in regulation in 2017Women more accurateWhile the distances being achieved in the men's game are impressive, when it comes to accuracy, they are being outdone by their female counterparts on the LGPA Tour. Last season, 86 women hit more fairways off the tee than the leading PGA Tour player, Ryan Armour, who hit 72.73%. Lexi Thompson was the leading woman with a remarkable 86.7%.Thompson also led the way with approach shots, hitting 77.7% of greens hit regulation, and there were 32 women altogether ahead of the top performing male player, Martin Flores, who hit 70.64%.\"It's not just about how far you hit it, you have to get the ball in the hole,\" former women's No.1 Annika Sorenstam told CNN's Living Golf in October.\"It's consistency, a lot of people think that watching a lady swing is something they can relate more than to one of these long hitters where it's just something we cannot achieve, but women show more long swinging, tempo like swings that amateurs can relate to.\"Greg Norman with the claret jug after winning the 1986 British Open.Consistency was keyNo one can accuse Norman in his prime of inconsistency. The two-time Open Champion won 21 times overall on the PGA Tour, though he's almost more famous for his 31 runner-up finishes, including eight times at major championships. He always put himself in contention, and a 2014 study by Golf Digest found that, since 1980, Norman was a better player week in and week out than everyone except Tiger Woods. Indeed, Woods is the only player to have spent longer than Norman at the top of the world rankings -- the Australian was No.1 for 331 weeks compared to Tiger's staggering record of 683 weeks. Greg Norman and a young amateur Tiger Woods during a practice round at the 1995 Masters.\"In Tiger's era, my era, Jack Nicklaus' era, consistency really was the key, consistently putting yourself in a position to do it,\" said Norman, who won the 1986 Open at Turnberry and at Royal St George's in 1993.\"That meant understanding your game and how you want to get around from point A to point B.\"Woods himself recently spoke about his frustration at watching the \"mental mistakes\" of the younger generation managing their way around the golf course, specifically at this year's Presidents Cup where he was a US vice captain.US vice captain Tiger Woods alongside Jordan Spieth at the 2017 Presidents Cup in New Jersey.Tiger frustrationsThe 14-time major winner said he saw six players make the same error at the par-three 10th hole at Liberty National, failing to take account of the wind and placing the ball in the wrong position on the tee box.  \"It drives me nuts,\" Woods told college women's basketball coach, Geno Auriemma, on his 'Holding Court' podcast.\"It's simple. Move it over to the right side, fire it into the wind so a bad shot ends up in the center of the green, not off to the right or in the bunker.\"It's little things like that which are very simple that you can correct, but I just don't think these players have been taught that.\"  Photos: Golf's world No. 1sJustin Rose, England: current No. 1  \u2013 Justin Rose is only the fourth Englishman to hold the world No. 1 spot.

Eighteen-time major winner Jack Nicklaus and Norman have consistently called for limts on ball flight.John Daly was the first player on the PGA Tour to record a driving average of more than 300 yards in 1997. Fast forward two decades and 43 players averaged 300 yards or above in the 2016/17 season, with Rory McIlroy top of the pile with a 317.2 yard average. \"What Tiger is saying today is no different to what we said 20 years ago,\" said Norman who would like to see pros restricted to 300 yards, including carry.\"He is seeing it more now because he's probably being out driven by 20 yards by some of these young players now. \"The skillful part of the game will come to the fore more but, more importantly, it's about the building of sustainable golf courses. When you build a course for a PGA Tour event once a year, the cost of maintaining it for the rest of the year is just ridiculous. Tiger Woods finished 12 shots clear at the 1997 Masters, his first major title.Augusta National, the home of The Masters, set about \"Tiger proofing\" its course after the big-hitting Woods grabbed the world's attention with a 12-shot victory in the 1997 Masters, finishing 18-under par for the tournament.They extended the layout by more than 500 yards and they're not finished yet. Earlier this year, Augusta bought land off a neighboring golf club with a view to extending the iconic par-five 13th hole, which currently stands at 510 yards. \"I remember the eighth hole at Augusta was nearly impossible to reach in two and now these guys are hitting irons in there,\" said Norman who finished second three times at The Masters, perhaps most notably in 1996 when he blew a six-shot lead and Nick Faldo took the green jacket.

What makes the 1975 New York Islanders special is that, as a recent expansion team, they weren't supposed to be a match for the Pittsburgh Penguins. But after dropping three games, the Islanders won four straight to win the series. Unlike the first six games, Game 7 was a defensive affair, scoreless until the final minutes, when Islanders captain Ed Westfall slotted a backhander into the net.Hide Caption 18 of 18\"Augusta can't lengthen itself anymore, but the tech is going to allow these players to keep hitting it longer year after year.\"If they sent out an invitation to the players and said 'you're going to use a gutter percha ball and a hickory shafted golf club, go get them worked out, practice before you get there, the best player will still win that week. \"The best players have that ability to make that adjustment no matter what they're using.\" Norman is one of the world's most successful sportsmen-turned-entrepreneur.Shark ExperienceNorman may want the professionals to be restricted but he's an advocate for technology delivering a better experience for the everyday player, whether it's balls, irons, drivers or even golf carts.In October, he launched \"Shark Experience,\" a multimedia platform that allows golfers to stream music, live sports action, news bulletins, entertainment and even Greg Norman golf lessons straight to their carts while out on the course.WATCH: Greg Norman: From golfing legend to entrepreneurThe technology will continue to evolve over time as more features become available -- just like updates on a smart phone. \"Every time you walk into a hotel you have a TV that's connected to everything -- music, kids games, movies, anything you want -- and I thought why can't we do this on a screen on every golf cart?\" said Norman, whose company operates in many areas including golf course design, clothing, award-winning wine and even his own line of steak and beef products.  \"You have a choice about playing whatever music you want from Frank Sinatra to heavy metal.

        "content": "(CNN)Former Bosnian Serb army leader Ratko Mladic was sentenced to life in prison Wednesday after being found guilty of genocide for atrocities committed during the Bosnian war from 1992 to 1995.Verdict proceedings had been interrupted earlier when the 74-year-old's legal team claimed that his blood pressure was too high to continue.After outbursts from Mladic, Judge Alphons Orie, who was delivering a summation of the case, ordered the removal of the ex-general, telling him he could monitor proceedings by audio and video. \"I am very distraught,\" Mladic shouted inside the courtroom. \"Everything that you have said is pure lies. Shame on you. It's all lies.\"Mladic's legal team had asked for proceedings to be halted or for the summation of the case to be skipped, which the Judge refused. Read MoreMladic was charged with two counts of genocide and nine crimes against humanity and war crimes for his role in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia from 1992 to 1995, during which 100,000 people were killed and another 2.2 million displaced. He was found not guilty on one charge of genocide, but received a guilty verdict on each of the other 10 counts. Mladic's lawyer, Dragan Ivetic, said it was \"certain\" Mladic would appeal.\"Butcher of Bosnia\" Ratko Mladic has been found guilty of the highest crimes against international law, says CNN's @camanpour, who covered the Bosnian war https://t.co/4A7DtVjHn8 pic.twitter.com/HdPKU3tqRD\u2014 CNN International (@cnni) November 22, 2017The trial, which opened in 2012, took place at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague, Netherlands. The ad hoc court was established to prosecute crimes committed during the Balkans conflict.  Mladic was accused of orchestrating a campaign of ethnic cleansing, including the slaughter of thousands of Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica in July 1995. It is the worst massacre to have taken place in Europe since the Second World War.Mladic judgment brings back stench of Bosnian genocideProsecutor Serge Brammertz told reporters that Mladic will be remembered by history \"for the many communities and lives he destroyed.\"\"Today's judgment is a milestone in the tribunal's history and for international justice,\" he added.The trial of Mladic, who was arrested in 2011, has lasted 530 days and included more than 500 witnesses and nearly 10,000 exhibits. Before the case was adjourned last December, prosecutors recommended a life sentence. Mladic had previously referred to the court as \"satanic\" and labeled the charges against him as \"obnoxious.\"ReactionAt a center for the association of women victims of war in Sarajevo, there was an outpouring of emotion during the judge's summation.There was particular frustration that Mladic was acquitted on one charge of genocide in Bosnian municipalities outside of Srebrenica.Amela Meduseljac (L) and Meliha Mrdzic were unhappy that Mladic was acquitted on one charge.Meliha Mrdzic, who said her father and brother were killed and thrown into the Drina River in Visegrad, told CNN she was left humiliated by the decision.\"The international community made me a victim a second time,\" she said. \"They make it seem like we killed ourselves, raped ourselves, slaughtered ourselves. I feel so hurt, I can't describe it.\"Amela Meduseljac, who said she was raped by Mladic's soldiers at Visegrad, said that victims will struggle to get over the judgment.\"Our mission as a rape survivor association was to stop victims from feeling like victims,\" she said. \"But it's getting worse from year to year and it will get especially worse after this verdict.\"People in Srebrenica celebrate as they watch a live TV broadcast of the trial Wednesday.UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein called Mladic the \"epitome of evil\" and labeled his conviction a \"momentous victory for justice.\"  \"Mladic presided over some of the darkest crimes to occur in Europe since World War II, bringing terror, death and destruction to thousands of victims, and sorrow, tragedy and trauma to countless more,\" Zeid said in a statement.\"His conviction is a testament to the courage and determination of those victims and witnesses who never gave up hope that they would see him brought to justice.\"A woman writes in a book inside a traveling monument called \"Prijedor 92\" outside the tribunal in The Hague on Wednesday.In Serbia, the country's president, Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, urged his people to look forward to the future.\"Today is not a day for joy, nor for sorrow, but to see what kind of future we want,\" he told reporters. \"We all knew that the judgment would be like that. There is no one who did not know it in advance. My call to all citizens of Serbia is to start looking at the future today. \"Let's think about where and how our children will live. How and in what way will we preserve peace and stability in the region\"In a separate development, Serbia's Minister for Justice Nela Kuburovi\u0107 urged that Mladic be released to undergo medical treatment.Who is Ratko Mladic?The ex-general -- accused of being \"the Butcher of Bosnia\" -- was in command of the Bosnian Serb army that entered the town of Srebrenica in July 1995. In the days that followed, 8,000 Muslim men and boys were systematically slaughtered by troops under his leadership.JUST WATCHEDAmanpour meets the 'Butcher of Bosnia'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAmanpour meets the 'Butcher of Bosnia' 04:05The late Bosnia peace negotiator Richard Holbrooke once described Mladic as \"one of those lethal combinations that history thrusts up occasionally -- a charismatic murderer.\"Read: Bosnia's future is tied to justiceMladic faced charges over his actions during the siege of Sarajevo, where his heavily armed forces cut the city off from the outside world.

He was extradited for trial in the Netherlands.Srebrenica massacre: Two decades on, wounds still raw, graves still openIn 2011, a tribunal judge entered pleas of not guilty for Mladic after he refused to cooperate and was forcibly removed from the courtroom at the judge's order.Mladic's judgment day comes more than a year after Bosnian Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic was sentenced to 40 years in prison for his role in the 1990s conflict. Former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic was arrested in 2001 but died before his trial could be completed.At a news conference following the verdict, Mladic's son Darko said that his father felt sorry for every victim of the conflict. \"General Mladic cannot accept responsibility for things he did not do,\" Darko Mladic said.

The new AC75 will feature canting foils and a return to traditional soft sails.'Challenging' and 'competitive'When they first announced a return to monohulls, fans of the high-speed catamarans in Bermuda claimed it was a backward step, that it would turn off the new audience drawn in by the spectacle of these flying boats, and reduce the interest of potential new teams.   Unfazed, the Kiwis and Italians evaluated a wide range of designs as they sought a high-performance boat that will produce close match racing, will be \"challenging and demanding to sail\" and will reward the \"top level of skill for the crews.\"Safety was also key, and as a result the AC75 will also be able to right itself in the event of a capsize. \"The choice of a monohull was a fundamental condition for us to be involved again in the America's Cup,\" said Patrizio Bertelli, chairman of Luna Rossa.  \"This is not a return to the past, but rather a step towards the future.\"READ: America's Cup afterlife -- how life has changed for Kiwi winners  Team New Zealand hopes the new boats will promote close, high-speed racing in Auckland.'Incredible challenge'Bertelli added: \"The concept of the new AC 75 Class ... will open new horizons for racing yachts, which, in the future, may also extend to cruising.

In his column for CNN Sport, he recalls what it was like playing golf with the future President of the US back in 2014 at Trump's golf course in Scotland.  (CNN)In May 2014, we were scheduled to have our second interview with the business tycoon and TV celebrity Donald Trump at the newly-opened Trump International Golf Links outside Aberdeen, Scotland. We had been allotted two hours with the man who would, as we now know, go on to become America's 45th President and we had him to ourselves -- to interview him as we played a few holes of his stunning links course.Follow @cnnsport\n\nTwo years previously, I had interviewed Trump in a cottage office on site, when the construction of the Scottish course was well underway but far from complete. Back in 2012, he was in the throes of taking on the Scottish Parliament over a proposed wind farm that would be visible from his beloved golf development. Trump playing golf on the Trump International Golf Links back in 2012He was in no mood to back down and had no issue commanding the floor of the packed Parliament in Edinburgh to defend his views. Read MoreIn the years before all of that, he had fought with some residents and landowners about his plans for his first Scottish course and, despite their objections, pushed on relentlessly. The following year he purchased the Doonbeg links on the Atlantic coast of mid-west Ireland and, prior to our latest feature on him, we had just returned from Dubai, where his new golf and property development with the DAMAC group was underway. Trump was becoming a massive name in the golf world, mainly through acquisitions but, increasingly, with newer designs.READ: Trump's businesses are losing millions in ScotlandREAD: Trump's son opens new Turnberry golf course JUST WATCHEDLee Westwood: Modern courses are too difficultReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLee Westwood: Modern courses are too difficult 01:51'A savvy media operator'I was interested to see how Trump's Aberdeenshire course was looking and get a sense of what the man who was making all of this happen was like. As if to underline his growing influence in the sport, he completed the purchase of the famed Open Championship venue, Turnberry, on the Ayrshire coast just days before we arrived in Aberdeen.As ever, the ambitions were massive.Upon arrival, it was clear the star attraction was on a very tight schedule. When I approached him on the porch of the temporary clubhouse to introduce myself, he was friendly but seemingly unaware of our appointment. He made a quick appraisal of the situation and, within seconds, was asking for his clubs and golf attire to be brought to him. Within minutes, the cameras were rolling -- five holes were selected on the back nine -- and we were up and running.Whenever we stopped to chat and film some interview segments, it was like an internal red light switched on and he was in full \"Trump\" mode. He was a savvy media operator and knew the value of a good sound bite. He was the consummate professional in this regard. It was the quieter moments of my time with him, as we walked between holes or waited for our crew to get a good camera angle, that were a little more illuminating. He was turning 68 the following month and acknowledged how \"big\" his whole life was. He said that it wore him down a little, but not enough to derail his business juggernaut.Overall, he was very pleasant to deal with and good fun during the shoot. He played extraordinarily well, hitting every fairway with his tee shots. He doesn't possess the prettiest swing, but he was deadly accurate from the tee. It is worth noting that, since we played, his golf handicap has been reduced by a shot to 3, which is astonishing given how much busier his life since became.JUST WATCHEDA tour of Trump International LinksReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHA tour of Trump International Links 04:41READ: Trump plays golf with Japanese hero MatsuyamaREAD: What Trump's golf game tells us about his style After kindly inviting me to join him for lunch, we retired to the temporary pavilion for some clubhouse burgers, club sandwiches, fries and diet cokes. As we ate and chatted in the company of his head groundsman at the course and one of his key legal team, George Sorial, Trump was on top form. As we parted, he invited me to play with him at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, at some point in the future and gave me his secretary's contact details. A full 12 months later, on May 27, 2015, I was emceeing an event in New Jersey and found myself in front of Mr Trump again. I reintroduced myself to him and mentioned how we had filmed with him at his course in Aberdeen the previous year for CNN.

Putin (right) praised Assad for his work fighting ISIS.It's the first time the two leaders have met since October 2015, just a month after Russia came to the aid of the embattled dictator with a series of airstrikes against rebels opposing Assad's regime.Putin and his government have been one of the chief supporters of the Syrian President's government, both militarily and in helping negotiate ceasefires in the country's long-running civil war.Hostilities between Assad and the Syrian rebels began in March 2011.The two leaders met for talks ahead of a trilateral summit on Wednesday between Russia, Turkey and Iran, Syrian state media SANA said. Both men, who are pictured hugging in official photos, agreed that the emphasis in the long-running Syrian conflict has moved from military operations to the search for a political solution. \"Huge successes have been achieved, both on the battlefield (and) on the political level. Many areas in Syria have been liberated from terrorist(s), and civilians who were forced to leave those areas have been able to return,\" Assad said according to state media.\"We must admit that the operation made it possible to advance the process of political settlement in Syria.\"CNN's Matthew Chance and Emma Burrows contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)It was just before midnight on Sunday when Christian Lindner, leader of Germany's Free Democrats (FDP), made the stunning announcement that his party was pulling out of coalition talks.Exhausted, emotional and flanked by his team of negotiators, he told reporters there was \"no common vision\" and no \"common basis of trust\" among the four parties.\"It's better not to govern than to govern badly,\" he concluded, shattering Germany's best hopes of building a coalition government after federal elections in September. A day of recriminations followed. The FDP consists of \"irresponsible narcissists,\" tweeted one politician from Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats, while the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) called on Merkel to resign. But beyond the hysteria and hyperbole looms Germany's biggest political challenge in decades. Read MoreHere's what's happening in Germany, what could happen next and why it matters.Should we be surprised by the breakdown of talks?Building this coalition \"was always a very difficult and complicated task,\" says Leopold Traugott, policy analyst at think tank Open Europe.Merkel's conservative CDU/CSU alliance, Lindner's liberals and the left-leaning Greens are not natural political partners.Christian Lindner, leader of the Free Democrats (FDP) announced his party's withdrawal from coalition talks late Sunday.And it was a goal without a road map -- Germany has never been led by a coalition of more than two parties.\"But most people assumed that the pressure would force the parties together,\" explains Traugott. Few people wanted to contemplate the likely alternatives -- a minority government or new elections.What happens next?President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Monday urged all of Germany's parties to keep working towards a coalition. He is meeting with leaders of the FDP and the Green Party Tuesday. Politicians have a responsibility to keep trying to form a government, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Monday.If the FDP can't be coaxed back to the four-party talks, Merkel's CDU/CSU (the largest party in Parliament) could try to form a minority government with the Greens or the FDP. Merkel has also said she is open to talks with the Social Democrats (SPD) -- the second-largest party in Parliament and Merkel's junior governing partner for the last four years.Merkel's critics will miss her when she's goneBut Martin Schulz, leader of the SPD, has repeatedly ruled out a renewal of the so-called Grand Coalition.The final option -- and the one preferred by both Merkel and Schulz -- is new elections. For that to happen, President Steinmeier must suggest a parliamentary vote on Merkel as Chancellor. If she doesn't win a majority, he will call a second vote, then a third if she again fails to win the support of more than half of Germany's lawmakers.On the third vote, the candidate with the most votes wins. Steinmeier could then name the winner as Chancellor or choose to dissolve Parliament. In that case, elections must be held within 60 days.  READ MORE: Merkel: New elections a 'better path' than minority governmentWhat does this mean for Merkel?\"Frau Merkel has taken a hit,\" says Christoph Nguyen, political scientist at Free University Berlin. \"She always seemed unflappable, but now that image is wavering.\"If there's a fresh vote, he believes that Merkel's position as Chancellor could be in doubt -- a position that seemed unassailable before September's election.Chancellor Angela Merkel said Monday she was \"very skeptical\" about the idea of minority government and saw new elections as \"the better path.\"But Nguyen is skeptical whether anyone is ready and waiting in the wings of the CDU to take over.Charles Lees, professor of politics at the University of Bath in England, agrees: \"There's no one to replace her.\"OPINION: Merkel's critics will miss her when she's goneHe believes Merkel will survive as leader for now, but leave office before the four-year term is up.\"She will want to go at a time of her choosing,\" he says. \"She will want to go out on a high as the leader of Europe.\" What does this mean for Germany?Germany could \"go on for a long time without forming a government,\" says Lees. There's a skeleton government still in place and 709 freshly elected lawmakers ready and willing to act.Germany's lawmakers met Tuesday for the second time since elections in September and just two days after the collapse of coalition talks. The German political system is built to absorb shocks like this, he explains. \"It's incredibly stable.\"And he's convinced that a minority government wouldn't cause the instability that so many German politicians seem to fear.First day on the job: Meet Germany's new far-right politiciansTraugott is less positive about the idea. \"A minority government would make Germany more inactive, domestically and on the European level,\" he says. \"There would be no strong government to say, 'this is the way it is.'\"If there's a new vote early next year, the outcome is unpredictable. While Traugott thinks the AfD could be weakened by a boosted turnout on the left and in the center, Nguyen believes the far-right party \"is the main party that will benefit.\"\"It will all depend on electoral strategy,\" says Nguyen.What does it mean for the rest of the world?It's clear that Germany will be taking a back seat in European and global decision-making for now.\"In terms of EU (European Union) leadership, all eyes are going to be on France now,\" says Nguyen. \"Regardless of what happens, there won't be any strong position from Germany for a while.\"The project for closer EU integration -- championed by Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron -- looks \"a lot weaker now,\" he says. \"It all depends on how France will fill that leadership vacuum. It's difficult to steer alone.\"Traugott agrees that it will now be more difficult to push through any EU reforms. \"But Germany is not the sole king of Europe,\" he says. \"Many things will still be possible, although progress on key issues will be slowed.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Fresh elections in Germany appeared increasingly likely Monday evening after Chancellor Angela Merkel announced that she preferred a new vote over governing without a parliamentary majority.The country has been plunged into its worst political crisis in years after negotiations to form the next government collapsed overnight, dealing a serious blow to Merkel and raising questions about the future of the longtime Chancellor.  Merkel's party, which lacks a majority in the Bundestag, had spent weeks trying to cobble together a ruling coalition with three other parties. But the plan fell apart when the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) walked out of talks shortly before midnight on Sunday over disagreements on issues ranging from energy policy to migration.Speaking to state broadcaster ARD Monday evening, Merkel said that the \"path of minority government\" should be considered \"very very closely\". \"I am very skeptical and I believe that new elections would be the better path,\" she said. Merkel also confirmed that she would be ready to lead her party into any new vote.Read MoreShe did not rule out further talks with other parties, however, and acknowledged that the country's next steps were in the hands of German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Monday that the country's parties had a responsibility to try to form a government.Merkel met with Steinmeier earlier in the day to discuss the country's options. Speaking after their meeting, Steinmeier described the situation as unprecedented in postwar Germany and urged the country's parties to work together to try to form a government. But Merkel is not the only party leader who has voiced doubt about whether further talks could lead to a resolution. Martin Schulz, the leader of the Social Democrats -- the second largest party in parliament after Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) -- described new elections as \"the right path\" earlier Monday.Either way, the setback has raised concerns about the political stability of Europe's largest economy. The euro weakened against major currencies on Monday and Germany's DAX dropped 0.4% in early trade before recovering its losses.Why the \"Jamaica coalition\" fell apart Merkel had hoped to build a coalition consisting of her conservative CDU, its sister party the Christian Social Union, the pro-business FDP, and the Green Party. The FDP's walkout came after the four parties had already missed several self-imposed deadline to resolve their differences. Merkel must now address Germany's biggest problems\"The four discussion partners have no common vision for modernization of the country or common basis of trust,\" said Christian Lindner, leader of the FDP. \"It is better not to govern than to govern badly.\"Speaking Monday, he expressed regret that the talks had failed but said that his party would have had to compromise on its core principles. The parties failed to make progress on a number of policy areas -- including the right for family members of refugees in Germany to join them there -- and tensions had risen.While the FDP blamed the CDU/CSU alliance for the breakdown, the Green Party thanked Merkel and the leader of the CSU, Horst Seehofer, for negotiating \"hard\" but \"fair,\" and accused the FDP of quitting the talks without good reason.The so-called \"Jamaica coalition\" -- named after the parties' colors -- would have been unprecedented at federal level.How did we get here?Merkel's position was widely seen as unassailable in the run-up to September's elections, with many commentators suggesting the outcome was so predictable as to be boring. But the country's two mainstream parties -- Merkel's CDU/CSU alliance and the center-left Social Democratic Party (SDP) -- suffered big losses on the night.      Smaller parties, including the FDP and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) -- who won 12.6% of the vote and entered parliament for the first time -- were the beneficiaries. Unable to form a coalition with one other party (as is the norm in Germany), Merkel emerged from the election substantially weakened.On Monday, the AfD hailed the collapse of coalition talks. \"We are glad that Jamaica isn't happening,\" said AfD co-leader Alexander Gauland. \"Merkel has failed.\" His co-leader, Alice Weidel, welcomed the prospect of fresh elections and called on Merkel to resign. The Chancellor told state broadcaster ZDF Monday evening that she has not considered resigning. \"There was no question that I should face personal consequences,\" she said.What options does Merkel have?Short of resolving the impasse with the FDP,  Merkel's options are limited. The SPD, Merkel's junior governing partner for the last four years, ruled out a renewal of their so-called \"Grand Coalition\" on the night of the election and reiterated that position on Monday. First day on the job: Meet Germany's new far-right politiciansThe SPD is also reluctant to renew the coalition as it would leave the AfD as the largest opposition party, granting it a set of privileges including the right to respond first to the Chancellor and a boost in resources -- an outcome none of the other parties want. Merkel's CDU/CSU alliance could still attempt to form a minority government with either the FDP or the Green Party separately, but this has happened rarely -- and never successfully -- at the federal level in Germany.If all other options fail, Steinmeier, the German President, has the power to set in motion a complex process that could lead to a new vote next year. But recent polling puts all parties roughly where they were on election night, meaning a new election could result in similar deadlock. CNN's Nadine Schmidt, Stephanie Halasz and Susanna Capelouto contributed to this report.",

Is it already time to pencil in a fourth straight NBA Finals with the Warriors and Cleveland Cavaliers? Here are four observations from the first month.1. Kyrie Irving and the Celtics are contendersThe Celtics' season looked doomed from the opening minutes when Gordon Hayward suffered a gruesome fracture dislocation of his left ankle. Turns out that was far from accurate.For more CNN NBA coverage ...For more CNN coverage of the NBA, go to CNN.com/nbaBoston has been rolling since thanks to the blockbuster acquisition of Kyrie Irving, who is making his case for superstar. Irving wanted out of Cleveland despite winning an NBA title and playing for a perennial championship contender.Kyrie Irving's 16 points helped the Celtics defeat the Warriors 92-88 in Boston on Thursday.He's fitting in nicely in Boston. Heading into Monday, the Celtics have won 15 straight games, including rallying to defeat the defending NBA champion-Golden State Warriors 92-88 on Thursday. Despite playing with a facial fracture, Irving shed his protective mask during the game and went on to score 16 points. Of those, 11 came in the fourth quarter, including two free throws to give the Celtics the lead in the final seconds.Read MoreLast year, the Celtics were the No. 1 seed in the East, bowing out to the Cavs in five games. But with a reshaped roster -- even without Hayward -- and the best record in the league, Boston is a contender to reach the NBA Finals.JUST WATCHEDWhat NBA players do on summer vacationReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhat NBA players do on summer vacation 00:58Perhaps Stephen Curry agrees. After Thursday's result a reporter asked him about his Warriors possibly playing in Boston in June. He smiled and said, \"It's looking very, very likely right now.\"Curry also added: \"They're playing the best right now in the East. And obviously, until they beat Cleveland, who has done it three years in a row -- so we'll see. But I hear the weather is great here in June, so we'll see.\"2. The Cavaliers have work to doIn Cleveland, it's been a sluggish start for the NBA Finals runners-up.The Cavs have had rough patches before. But for a team that is aiming for its fourth straight NBA Finals appearance, the results so far this season have been troubling.Cleveland is one of the worst defensive teams in the league, wading near the bottom statistically in opponent points per game and opponent field goal percentage. Another factor -- though this isn't new for a team led by 32-year-old LeBron James -- may be age.LeBron James leads the NBA in minutes played per game.Entering the NBA season, the Cavaliers average roster age was 30, the oldest in the league. In Miami and now in Cleveland, aging stars joined James -- who is aiming to reach the NBA Finals for the eighth consecutive time -- in the quest for championships.JUST WATCHEDHave you seen Nike's new NBA gear? ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHave you seen Nike's new NBA gear?  01:02This year's roster includes former Heat teammate Dwyane Wade, who turns 36 in January, 36-year-old  Jose Calderon and Jeff Green, 31. Additionally, Kyle Korver, acquired by the Cavs last season, turns 37 in March.There also are injuries. Isaiah Thomas, who was shut down in May because of a hip injury, hasn't seen any playing time since he wore a Celtics' jersey. He possibly could return to the court in January. Tristan Thompson (left calf strain) is targeting a return in December. Derrick Rose (ankle) and Iman Shumpert  (knee) also are dealing with injury.As it currently stands, their star in James isn't getting a lot of rest. He leads the league in minutes per game.3. There's (cautious) optimism in PhiladelphiaThe Philadelphia 76ers are an entertaining team -- when they're healthy. That's a big qualifier, because that hasn't happened recently.But with Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons on the court, the 76ers are electric. Embiid had one of the stat lines of the season with 46 points, 15 rebounds, seven assists and seven blocked shots in Wednesday's win against the Los Angeles Lakers.He's entertaining off the court, too, with a strong social media game. After the game against Los Angeles, Embiid posted what appears to be a subtle troll at LaVar Ball, father of Lakers' rookie Lonzo Ball, whom Embiid has feuded with in the past. The younger Ball is seen falling in the photo, while the location is tagged as \"Lavar, Fars, Iran.\"    WHAT A NIGHT !!!!! #TheProcess A post shared by Joel \"The Process\" Embiid (@joelembiid) on Nov 15, 2017 at 10:56pm PST Simmons, the early favorite for rookie of the year in a deep class, is averaging 18 points, nine rebounds and eight assists per game.But there is one current cause for concern. Rookie Markelle Fultz is out with soreness and scapular muscle imbalance in his right shoulder. And their young stars currently on the floor previously have missed time as well. Simmons is a rookie this season because he missed all of last season recovering from surgery to repair a fractured right foot. Embiid has a more exhaustive injury history since joining the league, missing his first two seasons, undergoing surgeries on his right foot. He played in just 31 games last season before he underwent surgery on his left knee.4. Checking in on the WestEfforts were made to try to match the Warriors' firepower in the West during the off-season, as the Rockets, Thunder and Timberwolves worked to stack their teams by acquiring the likes of Chris Paul (Houston), Carmelo Anthony and Paul George (Oklahoma City) and Jimmy Butler (Minnesota). So far the results are mixed.This year's MVP favorite plays in Houston. James Harden, the NBA leader with 31.6 points per game, has led the shot-happy Rockets to the top of the West standings with the Warriors. Paul, who missed 14 games with a knee, injury is back.James Harden leads the NBA in points per game.\"We've got everybody healthy now,\" Harden said. \"We're more versatile and more active.\"There's reason to feel hope in Minnesota, where the Timberwolves haven't made the playoffs in 13 years. With the current core of Butler, Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins, they look poised to end that drought, currently tied with the Spurs for the third-best record in the West.The Thunder, meanwhile, have sputtered out of the gate. On Friday, they blew a 23-point lead against the Spurs, falling to 7-8 on the season.\"No moral victories here,\" reigning NBA MVP Russell Westbrook said after the loss.But while these teams are intriguing for different reasons, does any of it matter when dealing with a super team of Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green? No matter who the challenger is, that team has to be clicking on all cylinders to dethrone Golden State in a seven-game series. That's a big ask.",

The team's official social media accounts also used the \"Come to Besiktas\" hashtag, joining the race to post the most viral-worthy content to confirm summer signings. Follow @cnnsport\n\nPortuguese defender Pepe was just one that heeded the calls -- compatriot Ricardo Quaresma and former Manchester City striker Alvaro Negredo were others -- trading the Bernabeu for the \"beautiful project\" underway on the banks of the Bosphorus river.Now, while Real Madrid's travails in La Liga make headlines around the world -- the Spaniards are 10 points behind leaders Barcelona in the Spanish league -- Besiktas are on the verge of reaching the UEFA Champions League last 16 for the first time in the club's history. #ComeToBe\u015fikta\u015f \u26a1 pic.twitter.com/x2o2xmsc2R\u2014 Be\u015fikta\u015f JK (@Besiktas) August 2, 2017\n\nRead More\"I had many offers from many big, important European clubs,\" Pepe, who joined the Turkish champions on a free transfer, tells CNN Sport. \"When Besiktas came to me with their offer and their project, it grabbed my attention.#ZAFEREKANATLAN, @Besiktas \ud83d\udc4d\u270c pic.twitter.com/ZlXKXKGuVk\u2014 Pepe (@officialpepe) July 15, 2017\n\n\"Many, many people sent me messages on social media.

Football is a passion of theirs. They demonstrate it with love and affection for their team.\" How far can Besiktas go in this season's Champions League? Have your say by tweeting @CNNSport or commenting on our Facebook page'I'd love Ronaldo to come'One man who has so far resisted the allure of the reigning Turkish champions is Pepe's compatriot and close friend Cristiano Ronaldo. During a live video on his personal Instagram page in September, the Real Madrid star was asked to \"#ComeToBesiktas\" on numerous occasions and took the time to respond to the fans' pleas.\"Pepe's there, and Quaresma!\" the 32-year-old forward laughed. \"They don't need me!\" The ever combative Pepe vies with Lionel Messi. But Pepe would pick his former Real Madrid teammate to join him in Istanbul over any other player in the world. If it were possible for this to happen, of course I'd love for Cristiano Ronaldo to come to Besiktas.Pepe\"Of course I would like for Cristiano to come here,\" Pepe tells CNN Sport, singling him out as a \"more complete\" player than Barcelona's Lionel Messi. \"He's a person for whom I have maximum respect; a friend; an extremely important person to me. If it were possible for this to happen, of course I'd love for him to come to Besiktas.\"The duo were club teammates for eight years, turning out for Los Blancos over 700 times between them on their way to winning countless honors.

Indeed, Pepe was named man of the match as Portugal beat hosts France in the Paris final. There can be few that know four-time Ballon d'Or winner better. \"Off the pitch, Cristiano is an extremely normal person,\" says Pepe. \"When something gets out in the media talking about him... I look and I say: 'This can't be. It's a lie.' \"People talk without knowing the real Cristiano. He's a normal person with normal habits like us.\"He likes his relatives. He loves his sons. He stresses the importance of being a father which I think is important.

His three-set triumph over Belgium's David Goffin was broadcast live on three Bulgarian TV stations, he received a personal message of congratulations from the country's President and the Mayor of his hometown wants to name their tennis courts after him.Follow @cnnsport\n\n\"This win means a lot to me, to my family, for the team but also for the country,\" Dimitrov told Christina Macfarlane in the CNN studio the day after his win at the O2.

An emotional Dimitrov thanked girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger after his O2 winIt earned him a winner's check of $2.5 million -- which is more than the winner of the French Open gets -- and 1500 ranking points, which means he'll finish the year as the world No.3, behind only 19-time grand slam champion Federer and world No.1 Rafael Nadal. Bulgaria has experienced tennis success before with the Maleeva sisters, Manuela, Katerina and Magdalena, who played in the 1980's and 1990's. They remain the only three sisters to make it into the top 10 at the same time. But Dimitrov, 26, is the country's most successful male player by some distance -- Orlin Stanoytchev reached world No.96 in 2000 -- and the first to earn more than $1 million in prize money. Thanks to Sunday night, his career earnings have now been boosted to more than $13 million.Dimitrov turned pro in 2008 and works with Andy Murray's former coach Daniel Vallverdu \"It's so nice when you achieve something like this when you're from a country like mine,\" said Dimitrov, who is the first player since Spain's Alex Corretja in 1998 to win the season-ending finals on his debut.  \"We have a tennis tradition with the Maleeva sisters but also I just want this to be an example, not only of sport, but the hard work and everything.\"Because it doesn't matter where you're from.

Dobri Belivanov, the town's Mayor, now wants to name the local tennis courts after the country's highest profile sports star.   Go to CNN.com/sports for more stories & featuresIt's not hard to understand why Bulgaria has latched on to Dimitrov's achievements. They've not experienced sporting success on the global stage since their national football team reached the semi finals of the 1994 World Cup in the USA.

In 1994, the Buffalo Bills fell to the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl XXVIII, losing their fourth consecutive title game. Super Bowl XXXIV in 2000 had a dramatic finish, with Tennessee Titans wide receiver Kevin Dyson being tackled just short of the goal line to give the St. Louis Rams the victory.One of the most iconic moments in US Olympic history took place at the Georgia Dome in 1996 when an injured Kerri Strug, later diagnosed with torn ligaments in her ankle, courageously nailed her second vault to help the American women win gymnastics team gold for the first time. The 1996 \"Dream Team\" won gold in men's basketball, while the American women's basketball team won gold as well.The Georgia Dome hosted three NCAA men's Final Fours, with Maryland (2002), Florida (2007) and Louisville (2013) taking those national championships. It also was the host for the 2003 NCAA women's Final Four, with Connecticut winning the title.Additionally, the history of the Georgia Dome is tied to two natural disasters. In January 2006, the Sugar Bowl -- usually held in New Orleans -- was moved to the Georgia Dome because of damage from Hurricane Katrina. The West Virginia Mountaineers stunned the Georgia Bulldogs 38-35.On March 14, 2008, a men's college basketball game between Alabama and Mississippi State went into overtime, and it might have been a lifesaver for fans at the dome. A 3-point shot by Crimson Tide guard Mykal Riley forced the extra period, keeping spectators from heading toward the exits. A tornado hit downtown Atlanta a few minutes later. There was extensive damage in the area, including at the Georgia Dome, which forced that game and the rest of the SEC tournament to finish at Georgia Tech's Alexander Memorial Coliseum.Final Falcons chapterThe Georgia Dome wasn't the original home for the Falcons -- the team played at the now-demolished Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium from 1966-1991 -- but it has seen the most success.Atlanta had 10 winning seasons and reached the playoffs nine times at the Georgia Dome. The NFL playoff history started in January 1999 when the Falcons defeated the San Francisco 49ers 20-18 in the divisional playoff round. Atlanta would go on to advance to its first Super Bowl, losing to the Denver Broncos.Atlanta hosted the NFC Championship Game in 2013. But the home team missed out on reaching Super Bowl XLVII, with the Falcons losing to the 49ers, 28-24.In January, the Falcons defeated the Green Bay Packers 44-21 to advance to Super Bowl LI, ending their tenure in the Georgia Dome with a historic win.\"For the fans, for this city and for the teams that rocked this place for 25 years, we felt your energy from the very beginning,\" Quinn said after the victory. \"So it's only fitting, at the NFC Championship Game, the last game played here, we felt that, too.\"",

It also temporarily was the home court for the NBA's Atlanta Hawks in the late 1990s while nearby Philips Arena was being built.Crews are beginning to install the blast wall. #DomeFarewell pic.twitter.com/yQYJhGS9m8\u2014 Georgia Dome (@GeorgiaDome) November 10, 2017\n\nThe stadium housed two Super Bowls. In 1994, the Buffalo Bills fell to the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl XXVIII, losing their fourth consecutive title game. Super Bowl XXXIV in 2000 had a dramatic finish, with Tennessee Titans wide receiver Kevin Dyson being tackled just short of the goal line to give the St. Louis Rams the victory.One of the most iconic moments in US Olympic history took place at the Georgia Dome in 1996 when an injured Kerri Strug, later diagnosed with torn ligaments in her ankle, courageously nailed her second vault to help the American women win gymnastics team gold for the first time. The 1996 \"Dream Team\" won gold in men's basketball, while the American women's basketball team won gold as well.The Georgia Dome hosted three NCAA men's Final Fours, with Maryland (2002), Florida (2007) and Louisville (2013) taking those national championships. It also was the host for the 2003 NCAA women's Final Four, with Connecticut winning the title.It's going to take 4,800 pounds of explosives + 6 miles of detonating cord + 1 mile of wire connections to bring the @GeorgiaDome down!READ/WATCH: https://t.co/wchvPevyuu pic.twitter.com/AAkODHNhxu\u2014 WSB-TV (@wsbtv) November 16, 2017\n\nAdditionally, the history of the Georgia Dome is tied to two natural disasters. In January 2006, the Sugar Bowl -- usually held in New Orleans -- was moved to the Georgia Dome because of damage from Hurricane Katrina. The West Virginia Mountaineers stunned the Georgia Bulldogs 38-35.On March 14, 2008, a men's college basketball game between Alabama and Mississippi State went into overtime, and it might have been a lifesaver for fans at the dome. A 3-point shot by Crimson Tide guard Mykal Riley forced the extra period, keeping spectators from heading toward the exits. A tornado hit downtown Atlanta a few minutes later. There was extensive damage in the area, including at the Georgia Dome, which forced that game and the rest of the SEC tournament to finish at Georgia Tech's Alexander Memorial Coliseum.Final Falcons chapterThe Georgia Dome wasn't the original home for the Falcons -- the team played at the now-demolished Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium from 1966-1991 -- but it has seen the most success.Atlanta had 10 winning seasons and reached the playoffs nine times at the Georgia Dome. The NFL playoff history started in January 1999 when the Falcons defeated the San Francisco 49ers 20-18 in the divisional playoff round. Atlanta would go on to advance to its first Super Bowl, losing to the Denver Broncos.Atlanta hosted the NFC Championship Game in 2013. But the home team missed out on reaching Super Bowl XLVII, with the Falcons losing to the 49ers, 28-24.In January, the Falcons defeated the Green Bay Packers 44-21 to advance to Super Bowl LI, ending their tenure in the Georgia Dome with a historic win.\"For the fans, for this city and for the teams that rocked this place for 25 years, we felt your energy from the very beginning,\" Quinn said after the victory. \"So it's only fitting, at the NFC Championship Game, the last game played here, we felt that, too.\"",

It was our home,\" Antonio \u00c1lvarez, a lifelong Atletico Madrid fan, says ruefully.At the start of this season, Spanish side Atletico moved into their ultramodern 68,000-seater stadium, the Wanda Metropolitano, leaving behind the Vicente Calderon, the place the La Liga team had called home for more than half a century.Follow @cnnsport\n\nThe old stadium, in many ways, had come to reflect the team on the pitch; rugged, rough around the edges, but also impressive.The atmosphere and architecture was like no other stadium in the Spanish top flight and, in the club's toughest matches, it could be the team's heartbeat. Atletico Madrid celebrates after scoring the opener in the 2-0 win over Sevilla, one of only two home victories this season.The Wanda Metropolitano may look better, but it is not the same as the old Vicente Calderon.Read MoreLocated 10 kilometers from central Madrid, Atletico's new home is, say some, too far from their old stomping ground, which was in the heart of the Spanish capital. Gone is the pre-match tapas and no longer do fans congregate in the city center before the match to drink, predict scores and debate over the team's fortunes. \"Now we have to make this new ground our home,\" Alvarez continues. \"In my case, what I miss the most is the time before the match. Going to La Latina, having some beers and tapas right before kick off was priceless.\"Beatriz Moliz, a fellow Atletico Madrid season ticket holder, echoes these sentiments.\"I think people are taking in all the changes,\" she says. \"Not only the new stadium, name or logo, but also the stadium's location, it's too far from the town center.\"But, however difficult the move, it was necessary. Atletico, a team which in the last five-and-a-half years has won the Europa League, the Copa del Rey and La Liga and reached two Champions League finals, have to keep apace with their rivals Real Madrid and Barcelona, as well as football's increasingly commercial world.

While at times the tactics have been adapted, the same pragmatic philosophy has remained.The frustration towards the team's indifferent start to the season -- they are unbeaten in the La Liga but have drawn five of their 11 games -- has been exacerbated by the move to their new home.Atletico did not win a trophy last seasonThe team sit on the verge of elimination from the Champions League group stages, too, with a draw against Qarabag at the Wanda Metropolitano the low point in a campaign which is yet to yield a win.At times over the past two seasons we have seen a more expansive and exciting Atletico, but this season the team seems to have retreated into its shell, their performances not befitting their spectacular new stage.Spanish football expert Guillem Balague tells CNN Sport: \"It's true that new lights and new shapes bring new demands because the stage is so huge and so impressive that you want an Atletico Madrid that plays better football perhaps. \"So there seems to be a divorce between the expectations of the team right now and what they can produce. \"But it's also six years with Simeone, a guy that just gets everything out of you. And I just wonder that if, at some point, having won what they've won, having been where they've been right at the top, now everybody is like, 'pfft'.\"It's too much.\"\ud83d\udccb | SQUAD LIST\ud83c\udfe7 Check out who @Simeone called up for #AtletiRealMadrid! \ud83d\udc47#A\u00fapaAtleti pic.twitter.com/QwCGyJE8xH\u2014 Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid (@atletienglish) November 17, 2017\n\nSimone revealed he had thought of walking away from the club following the 2016 Champions League final defeat to Real Madrid, but last month the Argentine signed a new contract, extending his deal to at least 2020. The 47-year-old seems determined to be part of the club's future. Though Atletico are experiencing a difficult period, they can still be expected to finish inside La Liga's top four, while dropping into the Europa League -- a competition they won in 2010 and 2012 -- presents a realistic chance of claiming a major trophy.But Balague says there is \"something fundamentally missing\" from the team this season. \"I just wonder if Simeone has the capability to take this team from what it is into something else that projects better football, more offensive, that they actually don't go backwards when they go 1-0 up, they go for 2-0,\" says Balague. \"Can he do it? The question mark is still there.\"READ: Chapecoense celebrate retaining place in Brazil's first division READ: World Cup 2018 -- who are the favorites? Home sweet home?Atletico are by no means the first team to have struggled with a change of scenery.Since moving to the Emirates, English Premier League side Arsenal have not come close to emulating the success they had at Highbury. Indeed, the Gunners have not won a league title since moving to their current plush surroundings in 2006.Last season Arsenal's north London rivals Tottenham suffered an early exit from the Champions League after staging their home matches at Wembley.But while Tottenham's usual residence, White Hart Lane, is being redeveloped, the club is also now playing its league fixtures at Wembley and Spurs' upturn in fortunes in their temporary home could, perhaps, act as inspiration for Simeone and his men. After failing to win their two opening home matches of the season -- losing to Chelsea and drawing to Burnley -- Tottenham beat Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League and have since gone on to win six of their last eight matches, including a famous 3-1 Champions League victory over Real. Real Madrid were thumped by Tottenham in the Champions LeagueOn Saturday, Atletico will play the same opponents Tottenham slayed. It is their biggest game of the season to date. What makes Saturday's Madrid derby all the more intriguing is that both teams are experiencing difficult times. Real -- who won the Champions League last season and a first La Liga title since 2012 -- are joint third in the table with Atletico, eight points behind leaders Barcelona. Neither can afford to slip up at the Wanda Metropolitano.\u00c1lvarez believes, much like Tottenham's win over Dortmund, that this is a match which could shape the rest of Atletico's season.\"A victory against Real Madrid could not only mean a turn for the team, but also for the fans,\" he says.\"The Metropolitano is modern but fans are reasonably close and the atmosphere could be amazing, but the team is simply under performing. Some players are not at his old level anymore and all this has coincided with the move to the new stadium.\"We never stop supporting, but I have to say that the last couple of Champions League games have been a very big disappointment.\"Moliz says a win over Real would be \"amazing\" but insists the team needs to keep \"fighting,\" a trait Atletico has become synonymous with in the Simeone era.JUST WATCHEDCopa90: Milan Derby - Derby della MadonninaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCopa90: Milan Derby - Derby della Madonnina 04:13Who do you think will win the Madrid derby?

Costa to the rescue?Atletico reportedly spent $57m on bringing Costa back to MadridIn July 2016, Atletico were banned from signing players for two transfer windows after breaching FIFA's laws over the signing of minors.More than the move to the new stadium or the current team's failings, it is the inability to rejuvenate the squad with new blood which has arguably hit Atelti the hardest.The club has already completed the signings of Diego Costa -- who returns three years after departing for Chelsea -- and Vitolo, but neither player can be registered to play until the ban expires on January 1, 2018.There is a sense that the red half of Madrid is just waiting for the arrival of Costa, known as the \"Beast,\" to restart their season, hoping that by the time the Spain striker arrives they are not out of contention for both La Liga and the Champions League.Frenchman Greizmann has been linked with a move away from Atletico \"Quite clearly they don't have the player that they need, which looks very much like Costa, to play the kind of football that they want to,\" Balague explains.\"With (Kevin) Gameiro, (Angel) Correa and Antoine Griezmann you cannot play the long ball, you just cannot do it. With Costa you can. \"Costa and Griezmann is a very, very exciting proposition but they might just be too far away from the top of the league and maybe even out of the Champions League.\"The fans, meanwhile, are in no doubt who the man to save their season is.Go to CNN.com/sport for more stories & features\"It\u00b4s crystal clear that we just don't score despite having really good chances,\" says Alvarez. \"Griezmann seems to be too worried about his future, Correa is the only player that gives us hope, but we all are really looking forward to have Vitolo and Costa in January.\"\"I don't know if the team is waiting for Costa,\" says Moliz. \"But I am.\"",

While it currently only applies on the mainland, it's being adopted into Hong Kong's statutes, and an amendment to the law which would extend the punishment to a maximum of three years is being considered by Beijing. Read MoreThe law has become the latest flashpoint for those fearing growing Chinese encroachment on Hong Kong affairs, amid warnings it could contravene international conventions to which Hong Kong -- but not China -- is a signatory. A Hong Kong fan sits in front of a flag before an international friendly football match between Hong Kong and Bahrain at Mong Kok Stadium in Hong Kong on November 9, 2017. OppositionPassage of the local version of the law is not expected until next year, and is sure to meet with concerted protest from the city's opposition pro-democracy movement. Even some pro-government lawmakers have raised concerns about the severity of the Chinese law, which comes after a highly criticized move by officials to pursue prison terms for student protest leaders. Those protesters -- including well-known activist Joshua Wong -- were granted leave to appeal their sentences to Hong Kong's highest court earlier this month. That case will be heard in December. JUST WATCHEDThe global fight for Hong Kong democracyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe global fight for Hong Kong democracy 01:48Hong Kong politician Claudia Mo, an independent democrat who's a member of the Legislative Council, told CNN that if the law is enacted in the city and people are punished for booing the anthem, their \"frustration and anger will grow.\"\"They will feel worse that they're getting clamped down, that the government is behaving in a rather authoritarian way.\" She says the perception is the government \"isn't trying to solve problems, just punish people who act against these problems.\" This year marks 20 years since the handover of Hong Kong from British to Chinese rule in 1997, when, under the principle of \"one country, two systems,\" Beijing promised to preserve the rule of law, freedom of speech and the right to protest for 50 years. A Hong Kong fan covers his face during the Chinese national anthem before the match between Hong Kong and Bahrain on November 9, 2017.\n'Critical time'Jeffery Au, a catering manager who was in the stands to see his team lose 1-0 to Lebanon, told CNN that now was a \"critical time\" for Hong Kong, as Beijing's hand in Hong Kong affairs seems more apparent.Au, like others, fears a clampdown on booing is a sign of unwelcome political change.\"Of course (fans have the right to boo). It's a stadium, we can do what we want. If we like the song we will celebrate the song but right now (fans don't) really like the song.\"He says fans will take whatever measures they can -- covering their faces with scarves or wearing masks or hats -- to obscure their identities and continue to boo the anthem. The law change in China will \"definitely\" have an effect on fans in Hong Kong, Patrick Au Yeung, a sportswriter for a local football website says. \"A lot of reporters are filming especially the Hong Kong cheering section so (the fans) will try not to have their face on the TV. The booing has actually diminished since last Thursday in the (friendly) game against Bahrain.\" In this October 10, 2017 photograph, a flag that reads \"Hong Kong is not China\" is displayed by a local football fan in front of the old British colonial flag after a match between Hong Kong and Malaysia in Hong Kong.\nHe also says that the fans have the right to boo, but should separate sports and politics.  \"I think everybody should respect their own national anthem, but I think Hong Kong fans should be concentrating more on the game than the political issues.\"Mark Sutcliffe, CEO of the Hong Kong Football Association (HKFA) called the booing \"a bit tedious\" in a blog post after the Lebanon match.\"The fans who boo have made their point now and I'm pretty sure that if there hadn't been such interest shown by the politicians and in particular the media, it would have stopped a long time ago,\" he said.Sutcliffe also criticized what he termed an \"orchestrated anti-booing rent-a-crowd\" who, he alleged, were paid to attend the match for the purpose of confronting the booing fans. \"I don't know who these people are or who is paying them but they are clearly not there to watch the football,\" he said. The Asian Football Confederation has threatened sanctions against the team if the booing continues. Local football fans hold up the Hong Kong flag during a match against Malaysia in Hong Kong on October 10, 2017.Boos, jeers, offensive gesturesAs the Chinese anthem was announced, the boos started and increased in intensity as the first notes of \"March of the Volunteers\" were played, a sizable number of people in the crowd, many wearing the red shirts of the Hong Kong national team, jeered and booed, gesticulating and waving their flags. Pro-Hong Kong flags, including one which read \"Die for Hong Kong\" were waved. Stewards rushed up the stairwells in between the stadium seating sections, waving their hands at the booing fans but that wasn't enough to quell them. Banners are supposed to be approved by the HKFA, an association spokesman told CNN.Meanwhile, a counter group of fans, who support both China and Hong Kong, were positioned in a distant part of the stadium. They numbered around 80 and were located in an isolated part of the South Stand. Above where they were seated they had draped a Chinese flag.Umbrella connections?In amongst the Hong Kong supporters, there were a few signs of the Umbrella movement, the 2014 political movement which saw sections of Hong Kong blocked by protesters for months -- one older fan, a man in his 50s or 60s, wore a t-shirt with \"I love HK\" written on it, but with the heart replaced by an umbrella. Many of those booing the Chinese national anthem have expressed support for Hong Kong independence, calls for which have been growing since the end of the Umbrella Movement pro-democracy protests in 2014. Beijing has reacted angrily to any calls for Hong Kong to separate from China, with President Xi Jinping warning during a ceremony to mark 20 years of Chinese rule over the city that it was a \"red line\" for the central government. Lawmaker Alvin Leung told CNN that there was no connection, nor coordination between the fans who are booing and the pro-democracy camp. However, he said that while his camp does \"not welcome\" the form of protest, watchers need to understand the rationale. \"In the past couple of years there have been growing issues, unhappiness against China, and the growing encroachment of Beijing on local issues.\"We need to understand why young people are not happy; (the booing) is just a reflection of their emotions.\" Set-toNot all pro-Chinese elements were sequestered in the stadium's South Stand. During half-time an altercation sprung up in the ultras' section -- hundreds of red-shirted fans surrounded one or a couple of people for several minutes, yelling obscenities in Cantonese and gesturing at them with their middle fingers raised. It was impossible to verify the identity of those being abused but fans told CNN they were journalists from Chinese state media CCTV. They were eventually hounded out of the section as fans sang, \"we are Hong Kong\" in English. CNN was unable to reach CCTV for comment.Hong Kong's South Korean coach, Kim Pan-gon, declined to comment on the effect the boos may have on his players' morale.\"I'm a football coach,\" he told CNN at the post match press conference. \"Ask about football. I only know about football.\" CNN's James Griffiths contributed reporting.",

Losing the championship last year enabled me to be the driver and the man I am today.\" Hamilton insists that he didn't learn from how Rosberg went about his business last year.  \"No. Zero,\" was his swift reply when asked.\"I'd say probably the only teammate I've ever really learned something from would have been Fernando (Alonso) -- it was my first year in F1,\" he said, referring to his teammate at McLaren in 2007.  \"After that, I would say I was able to have the experience, so I never felt I was taking anything from another driver.

Of course I want to win more but if I don't win another championship would that be the end of my life?

        "content": "Salerno, Italy (CNN)Twenty-six matching coffins for the mostly nameless victims of the latest Mediterranean migrant disaster were lined up in two rows in the center of the main cemetery in Salerno in southern Italy on Friday. Local representatives from the Muslim and Catholic communities blessed each coffin. Local students, refugees and survivors of the incident that killed the Nigerian victims laid white roses on their coffins. Ten were interred in Salerno. The others were put in hearses and taken to area cemeteries. The 26 women and girls were in a rubber dinghy that capsized in the Mediterranean on November 5. Also on board were 150 or more other people, according to Salerno chief prosecutor Corrado Lembo, who says as many as 100 people are considered missing. People touch the coffins after the memorial service.The Spanish vessel Cantabria brought the bodies to Salerno with the 64 survivors of the shipwreck, along with 400 migrants who had been rescued in operations off the coast of Libya. Monsignor Antonio De Luca, who presided over the ceremony, told the crowds that had gathered that the 26 women and girls and the two \"creations of nature\" -- two of the victims were pregnant, one in the fifth month and the other at six weeks -- died looking for a better life. Read More\"They were searching for freedom and they found death,\" he said. \"We hope God can accompany them in peace. Peace that they didn't find on earth.\"Monsignor Luigi Moretti blesses the coffins of the 26 Nigerian women.The names of only two of the victims are known. Osato Osaro was identified by her brother who was traveling in the same rubber boat, and Marian Shaka was named by her husband. Both were 20 years old. The rest were buried with a simple white card stating the number of their coffin. The Salerno coroner's office told CNN that each coffin also contained a picture and an information card with copies of dental scans and a list of traits like tattoos and scars that might someday be used to identify the victim if a family member ever comes looking. People for sale: Where lives are auctioned for $400Many of the victims were wearing two layers of clothes, which is common for migrants who are held in Libyan detention centers. Others had manicured fingernails and coiffed hair, which suggests they might have escaped the detention centers. One was wearing a shirt that said, \"I am super happy.\"In 2017 so far, more than 114,000 migrants have arrived in Italy by sea, and more than 2,700 have died or are missing, according to the United Nations' International Organization for Migration.  Lembo, the prosecutor, said that all efforts now are on finding those responsible for the latest deaths. \"I feel a profound sense of pity,\" he said. I want to shine the light on the phenomenon of the trafficking in the most thorough way possible.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)It all started with a Facebook post in May 2017. Krista Young was browsing \"Hawkeye Heaven,\" a Facebook page for fans of University of Iowa athletics, when she had an idea. She had seen pictures online of the University of Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital, which opened its new facility earlier in the year just a stone's throw from Kinnick Stadium, where the Iowa Hawkeyes play football. The new hospital towers over the east side of the stadium, sporting a bird's-eye view of the action below from its 12th floor \"press box\" -- a space where young patients and their families can take in the excitement of Iowa football.Her idea was simple: During each game, fans in Kinnick Stadium would turn and wave to the children looking on through the hospital windows above.\"It was just a quick thought,\" Young said. \"I just typed it on a whim and that's all it took.\"Read More'It's working!'Young didn't expect the moderator of \"Hawkeye Heaven\" to read her post -- let alone respond -- but within an hour, they replied and said they'd be \"pushing for this.\" A month passed and Young didn't hear much else. But over the summer, Facebook photos like this one began appearing and signaled that perhaps she had started something big.At the Hawkeyes' home opener on September 2, Young was in the stands as the team took on Wyoming. As the first quarter came to an end, she wasn't sure what was about to happen, but she pulled out her phone and hit record. On the video she captured and posted on Facebook, fans around her begin to turn around, and before long, the entire stadium is standing and waving toward the hospital.Astonished at the scene unfolding around her, all she could muster was to say \"It's working!\"JUST WATCHED'Railgaters' ditch the quad for train carsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH (9 Videos)'Railgaters' ditch the quad for train carsHome of the 'best butts in town'Lions fans show off the flavor of DetroitHave boat, will tailgateHow 'nerd nation' tailgatesKevin Gillespie's Chile Lime RibsNFL legend Hines Ward learns how to tailgate Northwestern tailgaters fire up Chicago pizza from the parking lotStepping and grilling at a Howard University tailgateHandprints, smudges and 'good medicine'Gwen Senio, manager of child life at Stead Family Children's hospital, works with children and their families to tend to their psychosocial needs as they undergo treatment and recovery. Many of the young patients she sees are facing severe and chronic illnesses, so simple acts -- like getting out of bed -- can be exhausting. But on fall Saturdays, no matter the pain it inflicts or energy it requires, kids will do whatever it takes to get up to the \"press box\" windows to experience \"The Wave.\" \"They're not thinking about how they're feeling -- they're just thinking about what's happening beyond that window,\" Senio said. \"Being a part of that is good medicine.\"To her, perhaps the most powerful reminder of the impact of this new tradition comes towards the end of the game, when most of the children have returned to their rooms ... and to the reality of the ailments they're facing. \"What I noticed early on is that after The Wave, the windows are covered with little handprints and smudges,\" Senio said. \"To me, that was just such a heartwarming recognition that there was a connection between the children here in the hospital and what's happening out in the stadium.\"'I just can't envision it ever stopping' In the months since \"The Wave\" was born, it's shown no signs of stopping. \"The Wave\" has made its way to Iowa away games, like this clash against Michigan State in East Lansing, Michigan.

While the vast majority were Poles, other protesters came from all over Europe.Poland regained its independence in 1918.One of the lead organizations involved in the march is the National Radical Camp, which has previously taken to the streets to protest against Muslim immigration, gay rights, the EU and anything it considers undermines Polish Catholic values. Demonstrators disrupted the march.While support for the group remains small, its critics argue that the Polish government, which they say has struck a nationalistic tone and linked immigrants to crime and disease, has fostered an atmosphere of intolerance and xenophobia that has emboldened it.Some of those marching lit flares during the event.Read MoreIn a statement this week, Poland's Deputy Prime Minister Piotr Glinski strongly condemned the gathering saying: \"We do not approve of support in the public sphere for an ethnic national community, we support the idea of a nation rooted in culture.\" This was echoed on Monday by Poland's President Andrzej Duda who said there was \"no room or tolerance for xenophobia, sick nationalism or anti-semitism\" in Polish society.Earlier on Saturday, the Polish capital had seen a far smaller demonstration by groups condemning  the hijacking of Polish independence day, which falls on November 11. Far-right marchers waved flags as they took part in the march.The day celebrates the re-birth of Poland in November 1918, 123 years after the Prussian, Habsburg and Russian empires carved up Poland among themselves and erased it from the map of Europe.But in the past few years, the holiday has been overshadowed by the far-right march and fears of violence despite condemnation from key political figures in Poland.President Duda led the formal celebrations of Polish independence day in central Warsaw. After laying a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier, he told the crowd to remember the price of freedom and independence. Update: Edits have been made to this story to clarify the involvement of ultra nationalists in the march. Subsequent statements from Poland's deputy prime minister and president have been added.Correction: An earlier version of this article reported that some of the banners at the march said, \"White Europe, Europe must be white,\" and \"Pray for Islamic Holocaust.\"The freelance reporter who cited the banners got that information from other media reports. But CNN cannot independently confirm the presence of those banners at this year's march, and so that reference was removed.",

The 34-year-old, three-time Formula One world champion from Sao Paulo wanted to help those less fortunate than him and reduce the gap between rich and poor.Follow @cnnsport\n\nHis fatal crash at the San Marino Grand Prix meant he never got to realize those dreams but, 23 years later, his name still carries a lot of weight and, thanks to his sister, it's being harnessed to make a difference in the country he held so dear.Senna won three F1 titles with McLaren and a record six Monaco Grand PrixLegacy securedSix weeks after her brother's death at Imola, Viviane set up the Ayrton Senna Foundation, a non-governmental organization (NGO), which has gone on to pump hundreds of millions of dollars into Brazilian society, specifically the education of children.Read More\"Ayrton represents a valuable asset to the country, a bright power for Brazil,\" Viviane, the Foundation's CEO, told CNN's The Circuit.\"I decided to focus on something big and that is education because it's the basis of any person or country doing well. There's not a person or a country that does well, if there is no education.Viviane Senna with current F1 world champion Lewis Hamilton ahead of 2017 Brazilian Grand PrixEducation is keyBrazil has the ninth largest economy in the world but has lagged behind when it comes to educating its youngsters.In 2015, the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) ranked Brazil 63rd out of 70 countries in terms of 15-year-old students' performance in science, reading and maths.The Ayrton Senna Foundation is trying to tackle this problem and every year helps around two million children and trains 60,000 teachers. Viviane with Prince Harry during his 2014 visit to the  Ayrton Senna Institute in Sao PauloIt's not just targeting the traditional subjects though. The Foundation runs computer coding programs for school children and tries to teach them the \"soft skills\" needed to compete in the modern world.\"There's other skills to be learned such as leadership, teamwork, respect, collaboration, initiative, flexibility, soft skills that are as important as the classic cognitive skills for the full development of people living in the 21st century,\" Viviane says. \"Schools, not only in Brazil, but in the world, haven't understood that new task. So the institute has the goal to offer knowledge and solutions to help develop this whole group of new skills so we can prepare people for the world that is out there and I think this knowledge could be made available to other countries because this is a task for the world.\"Strong brandThis work doesn't come cheap and is funded mostly by Senna's brand, which remains incredibly strong even though he has been dead for more than two decades.Senna's brand is still big business 23 years after his deathSo official Ayrton Senna ketchup is a thing.

He was one of the few. \"He went beyond just being someone who was admired, an idol, a cool personality. He was a hero and represented this bright side of Brazil, in a time where Brazil was dark. He had a profound role in Brazil's psyche. A very important role.\"`Ayrton and Brazil were as oneAn exhausted Senna could hardly live the trophy after winning the 1991 Brazilian Grand PrixSenna, who would be 57 if he were alive today, is widely regarded as one of the best Formula One drivers of all time -- certainly one of the most exciting -- and has become synonymous with overcoming the odds.He racked up 41 victories during his career, including a record six Monaco Grand Prix and two wins at his home track of Interlagos.Senna competed in Formula One from 1984 until his death in 1994\"Ayrton showed up, winning, racing talented drivers from first world countries and winning, it was like Brazil could be a bright, winning country, in an area such as Formula One, even if our background was negative,\" says Viviane.\"All the Brazilians would sit in his car, would push his car, we would raise the flag with him in the podium. It was like we were as one. Ayrton and Brazil were as one.\" F1 drivers carry Senna's casket at his funeral including his great rival Alain Prost, Emerson Fittipaldi, Jackie Stewart and Gerhard BergerSuch was his standing in Brazil, the government declared three days of national mourning after his death in May 1994 and an estimated three million people went to his hometown of Sao Paulo for his funeral.Later that year, Brazil's football team dedicated their World Cup win to Senna and today he continues to have a huge impact on the current generation of Brazilian sports men and women.

With that in mind, ahead of the Games, the Senna Foundation released 'On the Pulse of Brazil', a short animated movie with an inspirational message from Senna which Brazil's athletes were able to watch using an augmented reality app and a bracelet.Senna's story has enjoyed success on more traditional platforms too. The 2011 British documentary film \"Senna\" won a BAFTA and took nearly $11 million at box offices worldwide and a there's even a stage production, \"Senna: The Musical,\" which opened at a theater in Rio earlier this month.The Senna juggernaut shows no sign of slowing down soon and Viviane is determined to use it to help children in Brazil achieve their potential and \"develop the gift they come with in life.\"Go to CNN.com/sport for more stories & features\"I think people come into this world to be something,\" she says. \"Being able to be himself. that's what people really admire [about Ayrton], to be able to be what you were meant to be in this world.\"We want to offer people the chance to do the same, to develop their own nature through a full education.\"",

        "content": "Berlin (CNN)This week, the German city of Bonn is the venue for hundreds of diplomats who are busy hammering out a road map to save the planet from climate change. The country would seem an ideal host, with its sterling reputation for driving an ambitious green agenda centered around \"energiewende,\" or transition to renewable energy.Yet less than an hour's drive away from the COP23 summit lies an example of Germany's dirty environmental secret: A 12-thousand-year-old forest that has been almost completely consumed by the country's ravenous addiction to coal power.  Germany's biggest electricity provider, RWE, runs the vast open-pit mine that encroaches on Hambach Forest. Giant steel excavators grind away at the 33-square mile hole, leaving a scar on the green landscape but producing 40 million metric tons of coal annually.Every year since 1978, the mine has been allowed to fell a section of forest to access the lignite, or \"brown coal,\" beneath.  As a result, the Hambach woodland has now shrunk to less than 10% of its original size, according to estimates by RWE and environmental activists.Read MoreA court decision next week could clear the way for logging operations to continue again this year. If the court finds in favor of RWE, the firm says it plans to raze another section of the forest.An activist's treehouse in Hambach Forest. If you gaze up into the leaves of Hambach Forest, you may see the homes of its newest inhabitants perched amid the branches: More than 30 tree houses occupied by around 100 activists who see themselves as guardians of a woodland that sits atop one of the country's richest energy sources.\"They want to cut the forest down but they cannot cut the trees we live in. Unless, of course, they drag us down,\" explained Simon, a 30-year-old former forest ranger who now dedicates himself to environmental activism. He spoke to CNN from a solar-powered phone on the tree that has been his home for the last two years, and asked CNN not to publish his last name. Europe's biggest polluterAlmost 40% of Germany's electricity comes from coal-powered plants -- nearly a quarter from brown coal -- making it Europe's biggest polluter, spewing out more than 20% of the greenhouse gas emissions from the European Union, according to Eurostat. \"We need lignite. Lignite is not subsidized and we have a good supply in Germany. It makes us less dependent on imported natural gas, oil or other fossil fuels,\" Guido Steffen, a representative for RWE, told CNN.\"Conventional energy is still needed for a country that is as industrialized and as populated as Germany. You need a lot of energy, and renewables are just not yet ready to fully supply the country.\"A giant excavator operates at the mine in Hambach in 2015. Germany has invested billions in renewable energy and there has been substantial progress: On one particularly sunny weekend this May, the country was able to meet a whopping 85% of its electricity needs through wind, solar and other clean energy sources, but it was unable to sustain that for long. Previously, the country had relied on nuclear power, but after the 2011 tsunami that disabled Japan's Fukushima nuclear power plant, Chancellor Angela Merkel vowed to shut down Germany's nuclear plants by 2020. That left lignite coal as one of the primary natural resources for Germany's energy needs. The number of coal-powered plants in the country has more than doubled in the last three decades, jumping from 35 to 76, according to the Climate Action Network Europe. Many of them are in the North Rhine-Westphalia region, where the Hambach mine is located.Germany had hoped to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40% in 2020, but that number is more likely to fall to little more than 30%, according to the Environmental Ministry.\"Phasing out nuclear power and coal at the same time does present major challenges,\" Armin Laschet, the Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, told attendees at the climate change conference in Bonn, though he remains optimistic. \"Mining in Germany could end inside the next two decades.  We don't have an end date. But the expectation is it could be in the 2030s.\"Further expansion plannedActivists protest at Hambach in August 2017.In the meantime, the logging of Hambach's woodlands will continue, according to Steffen from RWE. \"We have had to log most of the Hambach Forest in the past, that is true. We are going to continue to log this season as well, it is inevitable. We have to do it because the forest is in the way of the excavators,\" he explained. Steffen pointed out that RWE has committed to leaving at least 500 hectares of the original forest intact, and said that RWE has planted 10 million trees over the last 40 years on the other side of Hambach in the hopes of cultivating a new forest.  \"Unfortunately, people in favor of the old forest never mention this kind of re-cultivation,\" he added ruefully.   The energy giant also insists it is working hard to reduce CO2 emissions.  Little more than six weeks ago, RWE shut down one lignite power station that was emitting as much as 5 million tons of CO2 a year. \"We will close down more power stations so that by 2050, lignite mining will be finished and the CO2 footprint will be zero,\" Steffen said. \"But this takes time.\" Environmental activist Simon says the oldest part of the forest is now at risk. For now, however, RWE is planning on expanding into the lignite reserves under Hambach Forest, even as environmental activists dig in, determined to resist. They have staged a forest occupation of sorts, creating a tree house village accessible only by rope ladders and powered by solar panels.\"If we can stop them this year, then we might have a chance at protecting the forest,\" Simon, the environmental activist, told CNN. \"But if they proceed with the chopping as planned, it will destroy the oldest part of the forest.\"\"What will be left over will be isolated islands of woodland, young, disconnected, with little biodiversity.\"",

During the meeting, Ratcliffe asked Johnson whether the British government would afford his wife diplomatic protection. But the Foreign Office had reservations about such a move, Ratcliffe said. \"Diplomatic protection is, in essence, when a state like Britain decides that Nazanin was being treated badly because she is British, and she is entitled to be protected as an extension of the British state. It is not unprecedented, but it is a big step,\" he told a news conference.\"I said I thought it would be important and helpful.

He is now hoping to have both of them back in Britain for Christmas and for Zaghari-Ratcliffe's birthday on December 26, especially, he said, with his wife's health suffering.Last weekend she was examined by a specialist after finding lumps in her breasts, said Ratcliffe, who also has concerns about his wife's mental wellbeing. \"She talks about being on the verge of a nervous breakdown,\" he told the news conference Wednesday. \"I absolutely believe that's true.

        "content": "London (CNN)Richard Ratcliffe is relentless.On Wednesday, after two weeks of constant interviews, writing press releases and telling the story of his wife Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe to the world, he will meet British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to discuss how he can secure her release from an Iranian jail.It is a significant milestone in a story that began 19 months ago when Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a dual British-Iranian citizen, was detained at Tehran airport on suspicion of spying -- claims which she and her family vehemently deny. What initially appeared to be an administrative error quickly escalated, and Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in prison. The couple's daughter, Gabriella, now three, was given over to her grandparents in Iran, while Richard Ratcliffe has fought for his wife's release from his home in Britain. In a quirk of fate, the meeting with Johnson would almost certainly be not happening were it not for an ill-judged remark by the famously off-the-cuff politician, which set off an avalanche of criticism surrounding the British government's handling of the case.Read MoreBut Ratcliffe is acutely aware that the sudden focus on the case will not necessarily result in an instant breakthrough for his wife.\"I've been promising her for quite a long time that it will be over soon,\" Ratcliffe told CNN. \"It can feel like quite an empty promise.\"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and daughter Gabriella.Johnson blunderThe renewed attention on the Free Nazanin campaign, led by Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband and an army of supporters, came two weeks ago when Johnson, appearing before a British parliamentary committee, said Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been detained for teaching journalism during her visit to Iran. The remark directly contradicted the position of Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family, her employer, and, not least, the British government, all of whom maintain that she was on vacation when she was arrested.The comments were particularly insensitive as Iran views with deep suspicion any attempt to foster an independent media in the country. But Johnson's blunder also fed into a wider political narrative that he is an ineffective foreign secretary, lacking a grasp of the fine detail of policy that is essential in sensitive diplomatic situations. That propelled Zaghari-Ratcliffe's story to the top of the news agenda in the UK.Britain's Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is set to visit Iran before the end of 2017.The seriousness of Johnson's error became apparent days later when Zaghari-Ratcliffe was summoned to an unscheduled court hearing, at which the foreign secretary's remarks were cited as proof that she had engaged in \"propaganda against the regime.\"  Fears have grown that her five-year sentence could be lengthened.But for all the political swirl, Ratcliffe is only focusing on one thing -- his family.He worries for his wife, who has endured interrogation, launched a hunger strike, and most recently was taken to hospital after discovering lumps in her breasts.The only insights Ratcliffe gains into his wife's mental or physical state come during their phone calls, which normally take place every Sunday.Some calls are harder than others, he says. Zaghari-Ratcliffe can spend the entire time crying down the phone.Other times she talks about she has been knitting and sewing new outfits for her daughter, who she sees twice a week.\"Sometimes when we speak she can be tearful and distraught,\" Ratcliffe says. \"When I spoke to her on Sunday she was all four seasons. She was laughing about Gabriella and what she had done and then was angry at other things.\"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is being held in an Iranian prison.While he fears for his wife's health and safety, Ratcliffe is also aware that his relationship with Gabriella is changing.\"It has been a long time since I saw Gabriella and I think she clearly noticed that she's lost her mummy and her daddy's not around,\" he says.\"She's understanding she's different to other children that her mummy and daddy don't pick her up from nursery.\"'Panicking'Today's grim situation seemed so improbable on March 17, 2016, when Zaghari-Ratcliffe flew to Tehran with Gabriella to visit her family.Ratcliffe remembers the day clearly, talking about how Gabriella would cope on the flight and how she might behave.He was looking forward to collecting them on their return from Iran and hearing all about their trip.But when Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Gabriella were supposed to leave for the UK, the trouble began.Ratcliffe says he had initially been told that his wife would return home after a \"passport issue\" had been resolved and put on a flight back to the UK the day after her scheduled departure.Ratcliffe says it was three days before he heard from her. She had called her parents to say she was safe, was helping police with some inquiries and would be home soon.Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe with her husband Richard and daughter Gabriella. But Zaghari-Ratcliffe never left Iran. Instead she was imprisoned and interrogated. \"I was sitting at home half understanding and panicking and not doing anything, discovering how dark it was and what she was going through, I felt that I really hadn't protected her,\" Ratcliffe says, recalling the first time he heard what had happened.\"I just assumed that it would be OK and the government would take care of it. I thought that it was all too crazy and couldn't really be happening. I was in denial.\"'Similar stories'After two weeks, Ratcliffe began to approach human rights groups. He spoke with those who had experiences of being held in Iranian jails and says he began to realize his wife's story fitted a pattern.Supporters hold a photo of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe during a vigil.\"I thought that something had happened with Nazanin over there, it was scary and everything would be OK. But when I started listening to the stories of others, they were all the same.\"The stress began to take its toll. In desperation, he went public with his campaign, creating a petition which rapidly gathered around 500,000 signatures.Discussions with the Foreign Office and lawyers started to give him hope, but the process has been slow.Then came Johnson's gaffe.  \"When I look at what Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was doing, she was simply teaching people journalism, as I understand it,\" Johnson told the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, in what should have been a routine hearing two weeks ago.Johnson has since apologized, claiming his remarks \"could have been clearer.\" He is due to travel to Iran before the end of the year and could now visit Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who has requested a meeting to discuss her case.While it's possible that Johnson's comments could have imperiled Zaghari-Ratcliffe further, the ensuing controversy has undoubtedly raised her profile.Ratcliffe, while desperate to set the record straight, seized the opportunity to publicize the case.\"It's important to put her story out there and let them know quite what level of injustice has been done,\" Ratcliffe says. \"People say to me: 'What? No, that can't be true?'\"This was quite a low level complaint at first. I didn't think the government was prioritizing her enough at a time where UK-Iran relations were being upgraded.\"There was a battle for her to be a diplomatic incident and we're now on the foreign secretary's radar. Now the Iranians have used his comments to frame her it means the government has to respond.\"Richard Ratcliffe, husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe holds a '#Free Nazanin' sign and candle.Amid the constant media attention, Ratcliffe has still managed to keep himself and his emotions in check, while wrestling with not being able to protect his wife or daughter.But now, with the government appearing to make moves and his wife's story in the spotlight, he is only thinking of the future.\"Nazanin's birthday is on December 26, it would be wonderful to have them both home for Christmas,\" says Ratcliffe.\"We are both closer and further away than we have ever been.\"",

Venus Williams has won a Tour-leading $5.5 million in prize money this year.Venus Williams topped the 2017 money list in women's tennis, earning $5.5 million from reaching two major finals, at Wimbledon and the Australian Open, and finishing runner-up at the year-end WTA Finals. South Korean golfer Sung Hyun Park, winner of the Women's US Open, leads the LPGA 2017 money list with $2.3 million in prize money.But even for female tennis players, life on the Tour is tough.Take British tennis player Heather Watson, who has been on the women's tour for eight years and earned more than $2.7 million in prize money. That may sound like a lot, but a large chunk of that is spent on being on the road, Watson said in an interview in Wuhan, China last year. Unlike team sports such as soccer, tennis pros are their own bosses, paying their own way to events and employing their own coaching staff. Briton Watson is ranked No.74 in the worldFor example, Watson -- who finished the season as the world No. 74 with $467,763 in prize money -- said players have to be ranked \"consistent Top 50\" to be able to afford a full-time coach. American golf agent Rocky Hambric, who has been in the business for four decades and represented 18 major champions, tries to sign players to his agency before they turn pro, at around 22 years of age. Although there is \"a long lead time\" before golfers really start earning a good living, the pay-off can be \"significant,\" because they can play at a high level for a long time, Hambric told CNN earlier in the year.

I'll do a couple of courses and basically be a soldier again.\"Ready for any opportunityJUST WATCHEDCNN interviewed Rokoduguni back in 2013ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCNN interviewed Rokoduguni back in 2013 03:00Rokoduguni was called back into the England squad this Autumn for the first time in 12 months thanks to an impressive run with Bath which saw him score seven tries in as many games.He came on as a replacement for the concussed Mike Brown early in the match at Twickenham and his second-half try was one of very few highlights in an underwhelming performance by the world's second best side.Rokoduguni signed a professional contract with his club Bath in 2012 The Lance Corporal has now scored in each of his three international appearances and he hopes that he's done enough to retain his place for Saturday's game against Australia.\"All I can do now is focus on the things I can control; my performance on the training field so that I keep banging on the door,\" he said.  \"I will review my stuff from [the Argentina game]; things I need to work on and improve, then train as hard as I can. I have to be ready for any opportunity that comes across.\"'Grindathon'It was England's 11th consecutive home victory but they struggled to create chances and Argentina, who missed five penalty kicks, enjoyed the majority of possession in what was described as a \"grindathon\" by England head coach, Eddie Jones. At one point during the match, angry Jones was caught by TV cameras launching a foul-mouthed outburst in the stands after a mistake by his team -- he was asked about it in the post-match news conference.\"We want to play good rugby so I don't think there's any reason why I shouldn't be frustrated,\" said Jones, who has said from day one that his main focus is winning the 2019 World Cup in Japan.Eddie Jones admitted his players were not at their best Value for money?Jones reacted angrily when asked if fans paying roughly $131 for a ticket got value for money from the performance.\"I'm not an economist, I'm not a businessman,\" Jones said. \"All I do is coach a rugby team and I try to get them to play as hard as we can. We might not have played well, but we played hard so I'm disappointed in the question. \"I'm sorry guys if you didn't think we tried. I'm really disappointed.\"Australia up nextTwo of England's Lions stars, Owen Farrell and Maro Itoje, were rested for the Argentina game but are expected to return for the biggest test of the autumn against Australia, who beat Wales 29-21 in Cardiff on Saturday.Jones, 57, who was born in Australia, expects his players to be \"much better\" after another week's training and he's relishing the prospect of playing the Wallabies, a side he coached between 2001 and 2005. Australia pose for a photo after beating Wales in Cardiff Go to CNN.com/sport for more stories & features\"We're hoping Australia bring their absolute best game so we can see where we're at,\" said Jones who has lost just one of his 21 games as England coach and beaten Australia four times in that period. \"We've got a very clear vision of how we want to play against them, it should be fun. I'm obviously not going to share it with you though.\"",

        "content": "London (CNN)Britain's beleaguered Prime Minister Theresa May has been urged to sack her Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson over his handling of the Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe case.On Sunday both Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and London Mayor Sadiq Khan called on May to fire Johnson -- who has been under increasing pressure since Iranian state TV claimed that his statements on the plight of the British-Iranian woman imprisoned in Tehran on charges of espionage confirmed her guilt.Writing in the Observer on Sunday, Corbyn took aim at Johnson, calling for him to be relieved of his duties after \"undermining our country\" and \"putting our citizens at risk.\"Khan echoed those sentiments, telling the BBC that if \"May was a strong Prime Minister she would have sacked him a long time ago.\"Also on Sunday, the UK Foreign Office told CNN that Johnson had held a \"constructive\" conversation with Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Zaghari-Ratcliffe.Read MoreZaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested in 2016.Johnson has been on the defensive over the past week since being forced to correct remarks he made to a British parliamentary committee, when he said that Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who has been in jail since she was detained at Tehran airport in April 2016, had been teaching journalism during her visit to the country. Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family have maintained that she was in Iran visiting family.After Johnson's original comments, authorities in Iran filed further charges against Zaghari-Ratcliffe, prompting fears her five-year sentence could be extended. On Wednesday, Iranian state TV IRIB said Johnson amounted to an unintentional confession.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is set to visit Iran before the end of the year.In his article, Corbyn says that the \"heartbreaking\" case of Zaghari-Ratcliffe has left her future liberty in peril because of Johnson's \"serial bungling.\"In a blunt final paragraph, Corbyn added: \"We've put up with him embarrassing and undermining our country through his incompetence and putting our citizens at risk for long enough. It's time for Boris Johnson to go.\"Khan was similarly critical of Johnson, his predecessor as mayor of London calling on him to \"clarify the huge error he made\" and help bring Zaghari-Ratcliffe back to the UK.Zaghari-Ratcliffe with her daughter Gabriella.Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is being held on allegations relating to espionage, has denied the charges, always maintaining that she was in Tehran to visit family and was not working in the country at the time of her arrest.She was detained at the airport in Tehran in April 2016 on her way back to the UK from visiting family with Gabriella, her then 22-month-old daughter.The Iranian government accused her of working for a UK media network involved in activities against Iran. She was sentenced to five years in jail and her child was placed in the care of her parents.Last month, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) opened a new case against her, accusing her of having joined organizations specifically working to overthrow the regime. She was also charged with having attended a demonstration outside the Iranian Embassy in London.JUST WATCHEDAmanpour questions Rouhani about prisonersReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAmanpour questions Rouhani about prisoners 05:13Further tensionOn Sunday, Johnson's colleague Michael Gove, the UK Environment Minister, added yet more uncertainty during an interview with the BBC.Asked what Zaghari-Ratcliffe was doing in Iran when she was detained in 2016, he answered: \"I don't know. One of the things I want to stress is that there is no reason why she should be in prison in Iran as far as I know.\"When told that Richard Ratcliffe said his wife was in Iran on holiday, Mr Gove added: \"In that case, I take exactly her husband's assurance in that regard.\"Michael Gove is the UK  Environment Secretary.Questioned as to whether she had been training journalists, he said: \"Her husband said she was there on holiday and her husband is the person who should know.\"Gove's answers are likely to create yet more ammunition for the government's critics over its handling of the case.Last week, amid an outcry from Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband and fellow lawmakers, Johnson held a call with his Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif in an attempt to clarify his remarks and call for her release. He admitted that his comments to the parliamentary committee \"could have been clearer,\" and added that he was \"sorry\" if his remarks were misconstrued.During the call, Johnson \"expressed concern at the suggestion from the Iranian Judiciary High Council for Human Rights that his remarks last week at the Foreign Affairs Committee 'shed new light' on the case,\" the UK Foreign Office said in a statement.May under pressureThe calls for Johnson's dismissal come with May facing a crisis over her Cabinet after losing two ministers this month.JUST WATCHEDHusband: Iran detained wife without chargesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHusband: Iran detained wife without charges 04:26Just last week, Priti Patel was forced to resign as secretary of state for international development following revelations she had met senior Israeli officials during a family holiday in the summer, a significant breach of diplomatic protocol.Patel's resignation came just over a week after Defense Secretary Michael Fallon quit after becoming embroiled in the Westminster sexual harassment scandal.Read: Johnson backtracks on remarks about jailed UK-Iranian womanThere is also speculation over May's de facto deputy, Damian Green, was forced to deny allegations that \"extreme\" pornographic material was found on his work computer in 2008.May's leadership is under increasing pressure with her Cabinet reeling from two resignations in the past week and her party's failure to win an overall majority in June's general election.She is also facing criticism over the UK's handling of the Brexit negotiations with the government being called upon to release secret documents detailing the economic impact of withdrawing from the European Union.",

Tushishvili is going to keep moving and, if Riner faces two or three more mobile competitors on the trot, it could be very difficult for him to sustain the pace.\" Naidan Tuvshinbayar (Mongolia) Mongolia's Naidan Tuvshinbayar poses with his bronze medal alongside Riner, Tushishvili and Brazil's Rafaela Silva in Budapest.

        "content": "Story highlightsThe MotoGP season is going down to the wireAndrea Dovizioso credits Luigi Dall'Igna for \"evolution\" (CNN)If you think of glamor and cars, one name tends to stand out: Ferrari. When it comes to bikes, whether on the road or on the race track, there is nothing quite like a Ducati.Last year the Italian marque celebrated its 90th anniversary, releasing a giant coffee table book -- Stile Ducati -- filled with sumptuously photographed bikes and telling the company's evocative story.  Follow @cnnsport\n\nOn the race track though, that story has its share of disappointing twists. Ducati's last MotoGP title came in 2007, via Casey Stoner. It has been a long and often frustrating drought.This year however, things have changed. Andrea Dovizioso has chalked up six wins this season, with two other podium finishes. The 31-year-old Italian led the standings at points this season, and arrives in Valencia in second place, behind Repsol Honda's Marc Marquez, but still in with a chance of the title.It's all in your mind...

He replaced the great Valentino Rossi, who endured two nightmarish seasons with the team, and no one since has ever managed to tame the bike.READ: Coming to a track near you - Honda's new motorcycle race car hybridA 'less brutal' bikeDucati Team Principal Luigi Dall'Igna A year after Dovizioso joined, team principal and much feted Italian engineer Luigi Dall'Igna arrived. The transformation has been gradual but profound.\"Dall'Igna arrived and the evolution got underway.  Bit by bit the bike was improved,\" Dovizioso says. \"However, it always retained its Ducati characteristics, with strong and weak points.\"In MotoGP, \"Ducati characteristics\" tends to be shorthand for incredibly fast, but incredibly hard to ride. Dall'Igna says this is changing: \"I don't think our bike is as brutal as it was before,\" he told CNN. \"Now there are several riders who can get good results with our bike. We still need to iron out some aspects, but generally we have achieved a well-balanced performance on many tracks.\"Dall'Igna's influence has been felt across Ducati, and extends to the way the factory and the track communicate. \"There were totally separate areas, the track and the working group back home,\" he says. \"That was the first thing I dealt with at an organizational level.\"READ: Will MotoGP's Catalan king wear the crown in Spain? New-found fameThe investment of Volkswagen, which bought Ducati in 2012, has also helped. \"Ducati is a company that makes a profit and manages -- on its own -- to face up to its economic commitments, including racing activities,\" Dall'Igna explains.\"But it's also true that having such a solid and robust group behind it -- on a financial and technological level -- is certainly important, because it gives you the possibility of approaching the future in the best possible way.\"Andrea Dovizioso on the grid in Sepang, Malaysia Away from the track, Dovizioso's success has led to him being recognized more. \"Obviously with all the wins things have changed a lot, and on the one hand it's great because people recognize all the good things I've done this year, but on the other it's not so easy to manage!\"The Italian also says the sport's fanbase is growing increasingly intense. \"Before it was mainly in Italy and Spain, but now also in Asia, Australia and America, the passion is increasing so much that there are now few places where it doesn't exist.\"READ: The curious case of MotoGP's missing AmericansSeason to remember Ducati holds a now biannual event called World Ducati Week, in Misano, Italy.  The 2016 event attracted 65,000 fans.Dall'Igna says his first experience of the gathering was astonishing. \"You can never have an idea of just what Ducati means until you go to a World Ducati Week,\" he exclaims. \"You realize just how many fans and how much passion surround the name. I will remember it for the rest of my life.\"Dovizioso will become world  champion if he wins in Valencia and Marquez finishes 12th or worse. But whatever happens on Sunday, this has been a season to remember for Ducati.  \"This year, to work for an Italian team, with so many Italian engineers and technicians, and with an Italian rider, and manage to score such fantastic results, is a unique and memorable experience,\" Dall'Igna says.Visit CNN.com/sport/motorsport for more news and featuresDovizioso sees this season as a stepping stone to more success. \"Luckily there have been many great moments this year.

Reportedly aided by the offshore law firm Appleby, records purport to show that Hamilton received a $4.3m VAT (Value Added Tax) refund when the aircraft was imported to the Isle of Man, a British Crown Dependency and an offshore tax haven.  The jet was entered into a complex series of leasing agreements which enable a full VAT refund based on business use. However, the BBC and the Guardian report the plane was also used by Hamilton for private flights. VAT refunds for private use of jets are banned under UK and European Union law.   The Paradise Papers were released when the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and its dozens of collaborating news outlets published investigations last Sunday. The reporting partners included the New York Times, the Guardian and the BBC.The project, which is based on more than 13.4 million documents dated from 1950 to 2016, covers a large number of global corporations, government leaders, and prominent people and their use of offshore accounts to avoid taxes or otherwise hide ownership of assets.The documents have not been independently reviewed by CNN.

But he's now starting to make waves in the singles game as well. A number of big names were missing in Paris but Sock still had to show plenty of psychological strength to get his hands on the trophy, surviving two match points in his first-round match and fighting from a set down in the final to beat Serbia's Filip Krajinovic.Jack Sock is first American to win in Paris since Andre Agassi in 1999 (Photo by Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images)\"Tennis is a very physical sport but the mental side is big too,\" Sock told CNN Sport's Alex Thomas after flying into London from Paris.\"I spent the last 12 to 18 months really honing in on it.

        "content": "(CNN)There's much that's still unknown about Brexit as Britain concludes its sixth round of talks with Europe, but what has been revealed is the exact hour of Britain's departure.In an opinion piece published in Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper on Friday UK Prime Minister Theresa May said Brexit would formally take place at 11 p.m. GMT on March 29, 2019.She also warned that she would \"not tolerate\" any attempts to delay this eleventh-hour departure -- which will fall at midnight in most European capitals.\"Let no-one doubt our determination or question our resolve, Brexit is happening,\" May wrote.The comments come at the end of a turbulent spell for May's government, which saw the second resignation of a Cabinet minister in a week, a serious gaffe by her top diplomat, further twists in the Westminster sexual harassment scandal and renewed questions about her leadership.Read MoreOn top of that, business and EU figures have warned that the clock is running down on Britain's chances of making \"sufficient progress\" on the terms of its exit for the European Union to agree to start talks on a transition period and future relations -- including, crucially, trade -- after a crunch EU leaders' summit next month.The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier, right, says it's vital to agree Britain's \"divorce bill\" soon if talks with David Davis, left, are to move forward.Britain's Brexit secretary, David Davis, and the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, ended the sixth round of talks Friday in Brussels, Belgium, with talk of some progress on the three key elements of the UK's exit -- what it will pay, the Northern Ireland border, and citizens' rights. But as expected no major breakthrough was announced with all eyes on next month's summit.  Most significantly, Barnier told reporters it was \"absolutely vital\" to deal with the so-called divorce bill within the next couple of weeks if the UK wants to begin talks on its future trade relationship with the bloc.Here's what we still don't know about Brexit:How much will Britain pay?The stickiest issue is the \"divorce bill,\" or what the UK will pay to settle its financial obligations to the bloc -- although Barnier said Friday he wanted to see \"sincere and real progress\" on all three elements before moving forward.JUST WATCHEDBrexit showdown bringing uncertainty to UKReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBrexit showdown bringing uncertainty to UK 01:48Speaking in Florence in September, May said she would honor financial commitments the UK made while an EU member, but EU leaders complain that her words have not translated into a specific monetary offer from British negotiators.May has also insisted that there can be no final agreement on the financial settlement until there's also agreement on the future trading relationship between the EU and UK. Different sums have been bandied about over the past few months, from 20 billion to 100 billion euros. Assessing the outcome of the sixth round of talks on Friday, Barnier said: \"On the financial settlement, we need to work over the next few weeks on the objective interpretation of the undertakings entered into by Prime Minister May in Florence. I think this is absolutely vital if we are to achieve sufficient progress in December.\"He added: \"It is just a matter of settling accounts, as in any separation.\"Asked by a reporter if he would need \"clarifications or concessions\" from the UK within the next two weeks for talks to enter the second phase, on future relations, in December, Barnier said, \"My answer is, yes.\"Davis, meanwhile, said that \"substantial technical progress\" had been made on financial settlement issues and reiterated that the UK would \"honor the commitments we have made during the period of our membership.\"The fifth round of talks ended last month in apparent deadlock, with Barnier saying discussions with Davis had failed to produce progress on the key issue of how much Britain should pay to leave.May faces pressure from within her government -- and from large portions of the UK electorate -- not to offer too much to settle Britain's account. But at the same time, the calls from UK and international business leaders for greater certainty as the clock ticks down toward March 2019 may force her to give ground in order to move on to discussion of future relations and trade.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, UK Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron talk in Brussels, Belgium, on October 19 during a summit of EU leaders.Where will citizens' rights stand?Another stumbling block is what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the European Union and EU citizens living in Britain after Brexit.May told the UK House of Commons last month that Britain and the EU were united on the key principles of EU citizens' rights, and were within \"touching distance of a deal.\"It's a complicated issue with potentially far-reaching consequences. Roughly 3 million people from other EU countries live in the United Kingdom, while around 1.2 million Britons reside elsewhere in the European Union.The UK published new detail Tuesday on a \"streamlined, low-cost and user-friendly\" process for those EU citizens seeking to gain \"settled status\" in Britain after Brexit, saying it wanted to offer them reassurance.Barnier said Friday that the sides were \"making a fair degree of progress,\" including clarification from the UK on how the process will work and how citizens can appeal if their applications for settled status are unsuccessful. But, he said, there are \"still a number of points that need more work,\" including on family reunification, people's right to \"export\" social security benefits and the role of the European Court of Justice.Davis said the two sides had continued to make progress on citizens' rights and \"are now seeking political solutions to the last outstanding issues on both sides.\" It is a \"key priority\" for the United Kingdom to retain the sovereignty of its courts, Davis said.David Davis discussing the progress made in citizens' rights - this week's detailed note on the issue can be found here https://t.co/zTY9806Uyx pic.twitter.com/wfCnj2gQsr\u2014 Exiting the EU Dept (@DExEUgov) November 10, 2017\n\nWhat will happen in Northern Ireland?Both sides agree that they want to avoid a \"hard border\" between the Republic of Ireland, which will remain part of the European Union after Brexit, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom.There is free movement across the border and many businesses have facilities on both sides.A key question is how to avoid the need for border checks if Northern Ireland, as part of the United Kingdom, is no longer part of the EU single market and customs union after Brexit. Free movement across the border was a key part of the Good Friday Agreement, the 1998 accord that helped bring peace to Northern Ireland after decades of sectarian conflict.David Davis and Michel Barnier say some progress but no major breakthrough has been made in the latest round of Brexit talks.Davis said Friday that the two sides had had \"frank discussions about some of the big challenges around the border\" and that the UK was firmly committed to to avoiding any physical infrastructure there.\"We respect the European Union desire to protect the legal order of the single market and Customs Union. But that cannot come at cost to the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom,\" Davis said. \"We recognize the need for specific solutions for the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland. But let me be clear. This cannot amount to creating a new border inside our United Kingdom.\"Barnier said the two sides had common goals. \"The unique situation of the island of Ireland requires specific solutions,\" he said.The 'Brexit Bill'May, who heads a minority Conservative government since a disastrous snap election in June, faces a battle to get the EU Withdrawal Bill, known as the Brexit Bill, through Parliament.She's announced her intention to put forward an amendment adding the precise time and date of Brexit to the bill before it goes before lawmakers next week for further scrutiny. But what's not yet known is what impact the many amendments put forward by other lawmakers will have on the legislation.May wrote in her opinion piece Friday that the government would listen to any proposed amendment to improve the bill. \"But I am just as clear of this: we will not tolerate attempts from any quarters to use the process of amendments to this Bill as a mechanism to try to block the democratic wishes of the British people by attempting to slow down or stop our departure from the European Union,\" she said.Not too late to forget it all?Meanwhile, the man credited with authoring the clause which allows a country to leave the European Union -- Article 50 -- has said it's not too late for the United Kingdom to change its mind.May wrote to the European Council President on March 29 this year to formally notify him of Britain's \"intention to withdraw from the European Union.\" But Lord John Kerr argues that the letter was only a notification of the UK's \"intention\" to withdraw and that Article 50 has been \"misrepresented\" in the current political debate.\"The fact is, it is a political decision that has been made in this country to maintain there can be no going back,\" he told an Open Britain event in London on Friday. \"Actually, as far as Brussels is concerned, as far as the treaty is concerned, this country still has a free choice about whether to proceed. As new facts emerge, people are entitled to take a different view and there is nothing in Article 50 to stop them. And I think the British people have the right to know this, they should not be misled.\"CNN's Simon Cullen contributed to this report.",

Just three years ago, Andersson was a 20-year-old taking extra mathematics classes to get onto an engineering course at college in Gothenburg. Then he made a tandem sky dive -- the standard first step into the world of parachuting in which the novice makes a jump while strapped to an instructor.Read More\"I really had no idea what sky diving or any of this sport was all about,\" Andersson recalls.  \"But when I did my first jump everything became really clear for me, that it was just this that I wanted to do, a lot, and I wanted to try and do it for a living and try to do it every day because I'd never experienced anything like it.\"A year after his first jump, Andersson tried wingsuiting for the first time. A form of base jumping, the pilots don aerodynamic suits that allow them to \"fly\" as they fall, steering with considerable accuracy before using a more conventional parachute to land safely.A few weeks ago, Andersson -- now 23 -- achieved that mark of becoming the youngest pilot to fly through a solid target at 250 kph after jumping off the Hintisberg mountain in Switzerland -- a peak that rises 3,000 meters above sea level.  The eye-watering stunt saw him steer through gaps just 15 meters wide and through targets that were just three meters off the ground.READ: 'The thrill, the fear and the excitement' of BASE jumping'What are you doing?'\"When you stand on the edge you're pretty nervous and it's bubbling in your stomach,\" Andersson admits.  \"All these feelings come and run through your head and you're questioning yourself, like 'what are you doing?'\"JUST WATCHEDSee daredevil hit apple-sized target over Great WallReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSee daredevil hit apple-sized target over Great Wall 01:22Once in the air though, those doubts quickly disappear. \"After you're jumping off and you're falling you cannot focus on anything but the now. You get into this zone where you cannot think. I mean, you can reflect and take decisions, but it's not like you can think 'oh I'm so scared.'\"You don't have time to react that way. Your brain kicks in with a kind of survival instinct.\"At such extremes, danger is ever-present, and Andersson says his preparation is meticulous. \"We use a lot of GPS data and measuring equipment to make sure what we're doing is safe,\" he explains. \"I also communicate a lot with other pilots to find out what they're doing. Body type and weight and so on, that all plays a part.\"Time stands stillHe describes the sensation of flying through a solid object as \"mind-blowing.\"\"Once you're flying through it you don't exactly realize that you even went through, because it's so, so quick,\" he exclaims. \"But on the same side, it's just like time stops when you're flying.\"JUST WATCHEDThese handmade suits give you wingsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThese handmade suits give you wings 01:58Andersson's passion for the sport comes across in everything he says.  \"I love to do it so much,\" he says breathlessly.  \"Even if I go and jump every day I don't feel like I'm getting tired of six hours hiking up in the mountains, seven days a week.\"Now a veteran of more than 1,600 jumps, many of which are documented on his Instagram and Facebook pages, his plan now is to work on his craft and try to take the sport in new directions. \"My goal is to become the world's best pilot.

On Wednesday, Iranian state TV IRIB said Johnson amounted to an unintentional confession.Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is being held in an Iranian prison.\"It seems Boris Johnson's remarks repudiated all the claims that we've seen in the past year and a half from British media and government officials who were saying Nazanine Zaghari-Ratcliffe had come to Iran for humanitarian purposes,\" IRIB reported.The IRB report said that Zaghari-Ratcliffe's role with the Thomson Reuters Foundation amounted to working for a \"multi-national company established with the aim of promoting Western-style democracy.\"Read MoreThe Free Nazanin Campaign released a statement saying that Zaghari-Ratcliffe's Iranian parents were distressed by the state media report. \"Nazanin's parents watched the main evening news in growing horror last night. They remain in a state of shock and disbelief,\" the statement said.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is set to visit Iran before the end of the year.Earlier this week, the head of the Thomson Reuters Foundation rejected the allegations and instead urged Johnson to meet with her.Read: Johnson backtracks on remarks about jailed UK-Iranian woman\"Nazanin has never trained journalists in Iran and we are pleased that he has admitted to the Iranian Foreign Minister that she was in Iran purely on holiday,\" Monique Villa, CEO of the Thomson Reuters Foundation said in a statement.\"It's time now for the Foreign Secretary to meet Nazanin in jail, as he proposed last week, and to bring her back home.\"'Sorry'On Tuesday, amid an outcry from Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband and fellow lawmakers, Johnson held a call with his Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif in an attempt to clarify his remarks and call for her release. He admitted that his comments to the parliamentary committee \"could have been clearer,\" and added that he was \"sorry\" if his remarks were misconstrued.During the call, Johnson \"expressed concern at the suggestion from the Iranian Judiciary High Council for Human Rights that his remarks last week at the Foreign Affairs Committee 'shed new light' on the case,\" the UK Foreign Office said in a statement.

It was clear, as it always had been, that Mrs. Zaghari Ratcliffe had been in Iran on holiday when arrested.\"\"The Foreign Secretary concluded by emphasizing that his remarks could form no justifiable basis for further action in this case and urged the Iranian authorities to release Mrs Zaghari Ratcliffe on humanitarian grounds.\" JUST WATCHEDHusband: Iran detained wife without chargesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHusband: Iran detained wife without charges 04:26Fellow Conservative MP Anna Soubry described Johnson's remarks as \"appalling,\" writing on Twitter that \"in 'normal' times\" the Foreign Secretary would have been \"sacked long ago.\"Opposition Labour lawmaker Yvette Cooper also registered her disgust on Twitter, writing: \"Hard to find words for how appalling this is. For him it's just another lazy, arrogant failure to check facts. For her it's incarceration.\"'Espionage'Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is being held on allegations relating to espionage, has denied the charges, always maintaining that she was in Tehran to visit family and was not working in the country at the time of her arrest.

She was sentenced to five years in jail and her child was placed in the care of her parents.Last month, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) opened a new case against her, accusing her of having joined organizations specifically working to overthrow the regime.

Follow @cnnsport\n\nHad Ospina not connected with the ball, the goal wouldn't have stood.With nobody inside the Estadio Nacional de Lima -- or watching up and down Peru -- quite sure what decision the referee had made, the celebration were strangely muted and delayed.Then came the realization -- and with it came the joy.

Despite Guerrero's absence, the mood in Peru is still one of confidence and expectation.\"It's a blow ... but its not catastrophic,\" Echegaray says. \"With all due respect to New zealand, if we were playing against a tougher, bigger soccer power I would be more worried. \"Yes, New Zealand should be taken seriously and have a lot of talent (Winston Reid, and Chris Wood) but Peru has enough talent to go through.\"Reportedly, Guerrero's lawyers have since said some flu medication he took for a cold he was suffering from at the time may have contained the illegal substance.Currently in Germany undergoing further testing, Peru are confident their all-time record goalscorer's previously impeccable record will help his defense in front of FIFA's disciplinary committee.JUST WATCHEDAfrican nations competing in the 2018 World CupReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAfrican nations competing in the 2018 World Cup 00:55\"For Peruvians, Paolo Guerrero is a national hero,\" Echegaray explains. \"Aside from everything he has done for the national team, his international reputation has made him into the most celebrated Peruvian footballer of all time alongside the legendary Nene Cubillas.\"It was big in Peru, that (drug ban) is all everyone could talk about but he is supported by everyone. He is a hero for Peruvians, so to the nation believes he is innocent till proven guilty and he has a right to defend himself.\"Folks from other nations who are blessed with so much talent (Argentina, Brazil, France, Spain) need to understand that this Peru squad, although filled with talent, is young and inexperienced at international level so Guerrero's role as a leader needs to be remembered.\"Peru national team midfielder Renato Tapia echoes these sentiments and, with or without Guerrero, knows the team has a job to do.\"We support him in all the things that he says,\" Tapia told reporters. \"He is our captain and he is always going to be. And yeah, we just need to be calm and be focused on those games.\"'Lack of professionalism'On top of Ospina's fingertips, Peru's good fortune in World Cup qualifying was extended from the pitch to the courtroom.

Technically a Bolivian citizen having lived in the country for three years, Cabrera's citizenship wasn't recognized by FIFA, whose rules state a player must have lived in a country for at least five years.The Court of Arbitration for Sport reversed Bolivia's win, awarding all three points to Peru and similarly converted Chile's draw into a win.JUST WATCHEDIs Russia ready to host the World Cup?

But with the triumphs came a series of human tragedies as \"Ferrari: Race to Immortality,\" a new documentary about the rise of the Italian team tells in graphic detail. Follow @cnnsport\n\nThe film focuses on the stories of five Ferrari pilots: Italians Eugenio Castellotti and Luigi Musso, Spanish aristocrat turned racing driver Alfonso de Portago, and British stars Mike Hawthorn and Peter Collins.Four of them ended up paying the ultimate price, dying on track in a horror-strewn 18 months for Ferrari.Read MoreIn March 1957, Castellotti was killed while attempting to set a lap record at the Ferrari test track in Modena. Two months later he was followed by de Portago when the Spaniard crashed out of the Mille Miglia (a 1,000-mile Italian road race). Worse was to follow when Musso was fatally injured at the French Grand Prix in July 1958, a month before Collins spun off at the treacherous Nurburgring while competing in the German Grand Prix.    Hawthorn survived his F1 career, retiring at the end of 1958 after becoming world champion. But three months later he was also dead -- crashing off the road on his way up to London from his home in Surrey.They were all pushed to their limits by the autocratic Enzo Ferrari who famously heaped pressure on his drivers, pitting them against one another in the belief that it would improve performance. But they all did it willingly. \"Ferrari is a dictator,\" de Portago says at one point in the film. \"If he doesn't like you he won't sell you a car but as far as I'm concerned he's a wonderful guy.\" The film is peppered with graphic footage of crashes and their aftermaths, including the 1955 Le Mans 24-hour race which killed 82 spectators, but there are also many unguarded moments off the track.\"It's got some brutal elements, but also at the same time it's got some beautiful elements,\" the film's director Daryl Goodrich told CNN. \"It's that contrast of the beauty of the era, but with that came the danger.\" JUST WATCHEDFerrari's secret:  make fewer cars ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFerrari's secret:  make fewer cars  02:55READ: F1 engines set to get louder Goodrich spent 18 months trawling through the archives -- 80% of the film draws on footage shot at the time.The mood of the story was transformed, he says, with the discovery of cine film shot by fellow F1 racer Wolfgang Von Trips who captured the drivers off track and on their travels to and from races.\"It was kind of a game changer,\" Goodrich says of the footage shot by Von Trips, who also died behind the wheel of a Ferrari, crashing at the 1961 Italian Grand Prix killing himself and 15 spectators. \"It gave a different feel to the film, made it much more personal, much more candid.

ESPN's Los Angeles-based reporter Arash Markazi is covering the team from China.Chinese officials wouldn't confirm the ESPN report that Ball, Riley and Hill were arrested.

        "content": "(CNN)Germany's top court ruled Wednesday that lawmakers must legally recognize a \"third gender\" from birth.Once a law is passed, Germany would become the first European country to offer intersex people the option of identifying as a designation other than male or female.The court ruled that the current system, which \"does not provide for a third option -- besides the entry 'female' or 'male,'\" is unconstitutional. In 2013, Germany became the first European country to allow parents of intersex children to leave the gender box blank on a birth certificate.Shame, taboo, ignorance: Growing up intersexBut Wednesday's ruling in the case, which was brought by an intersex person, goes further, requiring lawmakers to create the possibility for a \"positive gender entry\" for these babies.Read MoreThe new legislation must be in force by December 31, 2018, the court said. Johannes Dimroth, spokesman for Germany's Interior Ministry, said Wednesday: \"We fully respect the decision of the Federal Constitutional Court and the government is fully willing to implement the decision.\"'A very important step'Between 0.5% and 1.7% of the global population is born with intersex traits, which means a person does not have typical male-female sex characteristics, according to the United Nations.Some intersex traits are visibly evident, such as ambiguous genitalia, while there are a number of others which involve genetic, hormonal or anatomical differences.According to the UN, intersex children and adults around the world are at risk of human rights violations, in the form of surgery, discrimination or even torture.In 2016, a group of UN and international human rights experts called for \"an urgent end\" to these violations, urging governments to ban harmful medical practices and protect intersex people from discrimination.Infants born in Germany with visible variations in their sex characteristics often undergo painful and irreversible surgery to give them the appearance of a conventional male or female gender, according to an Amnesty International report published in May.\"Many intersex people suffer throughout their lives, physically but also psychologically,\" Maja Liebing, expert in LGBTI rights at Amnesty International in Germany, told CNN.Judge blocks enforcement of Trump's transgender military ban\"This judgment is a very important step for intersex people in Germany,\" she said. \"We hope it can lead to a rethink in society, to a realization that there are more than two genders.\"The word that will be used to describe the third sex on official documents is still to be decided. Liebing hopes it will be a term such as \"inter\" or \"divers\" (meaning \"diverse\"). This would mean that the designation would be open to adults who identify as neither male or female -- and who could then change their sex on their birth certificate -- as well as biologically intersex infants.A law introduced in New York in 2015 led to over 700 people changing their birth certificates to \"intersex.\"Once passed, the new legislation recommended by the federal court would give Germans the same right.Mixed reactionMany Germans voiced their reaction on social media. \"A third gender in the birth register is super...,\" wrote Twitter user Kenni. \"It hurts no one -- quite the opposite. A good step further in the direction of equality and human rights!Ein drittes Geschlecht im Geburtenregister ist doch super. Wenn es euch nicht betrifft, dann kann es euch doch egal sein. Es schadet niemanden, sondern genau im Gegenteil. Ein guter Schritt weiter Richtung Gleichberechtigung und Menschenrechte!\u2014 Kenni (@DKenni18) November 8, 2017\n\nOthers were less supportive. In a tweet, the Berlin wing of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party -- the third largest in parliament following September's national elections -- described the recommendation as \"the craziest idea of all time.\"But Germany is not the first country to move away from the traditional binary understanding of gender. In 2014, the Australian high court ruled that the government should legally recognize a third gender. And earlier this year, California became the second US state (after New York) to allow state residents who don't identify as male or female to change their birth certificates to match their gender identity.

Many from sub-Saharan Africa, are fleeing war and persecution; others from impoverished nations in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia have made the treacherous journey in search of better economic opportunities.The North African country is a hotbed for human traffickers, whose network of smuggling operations have gone widely unchecked due to Libya's lack of effective central governance.A rescue that came too lateOn Monday, Italian police arrested two men, an Egyptian and a Libyan accused with human smuggling. The men are not believed to be connected to the boat that was transporting the teenage girls.Since the start of this year, 2,839 migrants have died on the central Mediterranean route, according to the International Organization for Migration. 150,982 migrants have reached European shores, of which around 74% are Italian arrivals.In August, Italy deployed two military ships to Libya, offering training to the Libyan Tripoli Coast Guard following an agreement signed between the Italian Interior Minister, the Tripoli government and various mayors of Libyan villages to fight human trafficking.",

She also met with Yair Lapid, the head of Yesh Atid, one of Netanyahu's coalition partners, who tweeted about their meeting.Great to meet with Priti Patel, UK Secretary of State for International Development, today. A true friend of Israel. pic.twitter.com/8q9qSeX7YZ\u2014 \u05d9\u05d0\u05d9\u05e8 \u05dc\u05e4\u05d9\u05d3 (@yairlapid) August 24, 2017\n\nEven as Patel offered a \"fulsome apology\" on Wednesday in her resignation letter, May offered a firm rebuke to the departing minister.Read MorePatel's departure will throw May's Conservative government into further chaos after the sudden resignation last week of Defense Secretary Michael Fallon, who stood down after becoming embroiled in a growing Westminster sexual harassment scandal.Adding to the turmoil, May's de facto deputy, Damian Green, was forced to deny allegations at the weekend that \"extreme\" pornographic material was found on his work computer in 2008. In another development, former Welsh government minister Carl Sargeant, who was sacked last week after undisclosed allegations about his personal conduct, was found dead on Tuesday. He had apparently killed himself, the UK Press Association reported.Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was forced to backtrack Tuesday over comments he made about a British-Iranian woman, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is jailed in Iran accused of espionage, after an outcry from her family and other lawmakers.UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, pictured on October 31, is under fire for comments made about a British-Iranian woman in custody in Iran.The scandals are an unwelcome distraction at a time when May, who failed to win an overall majority in June's general election, faces an uphill struggle in ongoing Brexit negotiations. Her government is also under pressure from Labour to release secret documents detailing the economic impact of withdrawing from the European Union.Still, May's position is likely safe for the time being because nobody wants to step into her shoes at this point in the Brexit negotiations, CNN correspondent Diana Magnay said.\"Hers is an unenviable position right now, and unless she faces a sort of back-bench revolt from her own MPs -- which is perfectly possible -- she may limp on for a while yet,\" Magnay said.'Fulsome apology'Former Secretary of State for International Development Priti Patel in October 2016.In a letter to May on Wednesday, Patel apologized for causing a \"distraction\" and admitted that \"my actions fell below the high standards that are expected of a secretary of state.\"\"While my actions were meant with the best of intentions, my actions also fell below the standards of transparency and openness that I have promoted and advocated,\" she wrote. \"I offer a fulsome apology to you and to the government for what has happened and offer my resignation.\"May, in a letter to Patel released by Downing Street, thanked Patel but also rebuked her for the undisclosed meetings.\"As you know, the UK and Israel are close allies, and it is right that we should work closely together,\" May said in the letter. \"But it must be done formally, and through official channels.\" May said she welcomed an earlier apology from Patel for the meetings, which took place in August, but that it was right for her to resign \"now that further details have come to light.\" Patel forced to clarify commentsAccording to the UK Foreign Office, Patel's meetings in Israel were not disclosed in advance, but rather \"while (her trip) was underway.\" By convention, ministers' meetings with foreign officials are conducted under strict protocol. Any private meetings should be disclosed in advance.News of Patel's meetings with Israeli officials emerged in the UK media at the end of last week. In an effort to explain her actions, Patel told the Guardian that Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson knew about her trip.JUST WATCHEDWelsh politician found deadReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWelsh politician found dead 02:26However, Patel was forced on Monday to correct the record and make clear that the foreign secretary was not informed in advance of her trip to Israel, but became aware of it while she was there. In the same statement, she clarified that she had met with a dozen Israeli politicians and organizations. Patel apologized, saying: \"In hindsight, I can see how my enthusiasm to engage in this way could be misread, and how meetings were set up and reported in a way which did not accord with the usual procedures. I am sorry for this and I apologize for it.\"Jon Trickett, Labour's shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, said May had serious grounds to launch an investigation into Patel's apparent breaches of the ministerial code, and should do so or explain how Patel deserved to stay in her post.\"Downing Street has confirmed that even after she was caught, Priti Patel was far from frank in her meeting with the Prime Minister yesterday about her secret meetings and discussions with members of a foreign government,\" he said. Further meetings reportedPrime Minister Theresa May faces questions over her leadership as pressure mounts on her weakened government.Patel's apology failed to dampen the story. It was later revealed that Patel held two further meetings with Israeli officials that were not disclosed in Monday's statement.Britain's Guardian newspaper reported that Downing Street had also rebuked Patel on Tuesday for failing to inform May of departmental discussions over plans to send aid money to the Israeli army to support humanitarian operations in the Golan Heights, a move that would contravene British foreign policy. Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967 and annexed it in 1981. The UK, in line with almost all the international community, regards the Golan Heights as Israeli-occupied territory. The Jewish Chronicle then published a story claiming that May was made aware of Patel's meeting with Netanyahu within hours of it occurring and that Patel had been instructed by Downing Street not to mention the two meetings that were not disclosed on Monday.Downing Street dismissed the claims. \"It is not true that the Prime Minister knew about the international development secretary's meeting with PM Netanyahu before Friday, 3 November,\" a spokesman said in a statement. \"It is equally untrue to say that No. 10 asked DfID (the Department for International Development) to remove any meetings from the list they published this week.\"In response to a request for comment from CNN, the Israeli Foreign Ministry confirmed Patel's meeting with Rotem, a senior ministry official, but would not disclose the content of the meeting. The ministry also declined to comment on a report by Israel's Haaretz newspaper that Patel had visited the Golan Heights while in Israel.Yair Lapid's office told CNN that the politician \"regularly meets with senior leaders from abroad who are visiting Israel. The meeting with Priti Patel was warm and friendly. He looks forward to continuing to strengthen the Israel-UK relationship.\"CNN's Max Foster, Euan McKirdy, Andrew Carey, Hilary McGann, David Wilkinson, Eric Levenson and Sarah Chiplin contributed to this report.",

Look up, look down.Whatever you may observe, whatever you may come across, you won't spot the things that Dr. Sherylle Calder can see.The South African has been described as the most successful person in sport. She is often called a visionary, a pioneer.She is the go-to coach for many of the world's elite athletes, standing alone in her field, an expert in an area that is often overlooked; improving what is regularly abused, even by those at the peak of their sporting powers. Speed, strength, mental fortitude -- the key components to sporting greatness. But it is incremental improvements, often called marginal gains, which can separate the great from the good, be the difference between winning and losing. Read MoreFor Calder, the eyes are the missing piece of the sporting jigsaw, a weakness that can become a strength. Specializing in eye-hand, foot and body co-ordination, she is the woman charged with helping athletes see better, anticipate quicker. It is not about having impeccable eyesight, she says. Her work is not sight-related, but is based on improving the visual motor system and decision making. \"The eyes have to move effectively, just like the body,\" Calder, the first sports scientist to be awarded a doctorate in visual performance, tells CNN Sport.\"Most people believe we are born with the system we have, but you can train the eyes, the brain and the body to perform better.\"We warm up the rest of the body, but about 80 to 90% of the information that you base a decision on comes from the eyes and it's the only system we put by the wayside.\"JUST WATCHEDMeet the doctor training elite athletes' eyesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMeet the doctor training elite athletes' eyes 02:31The creme de la creme of world sportCalder currently works with England's rugby union team, Formula One driver Valtteri Bottas and Kenny Stills, the Miami Dolphins wide receiver who has thanked her for adding \"the edge\" to his game.The sports scientist was labeled as the \"secret\" to Ernie Els' victory at the British Open in 2012 after the South African golfer had sought her help in the months leading up to his victory in England.The list of Calder's past clients is exhaustive. It is the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the sporting world: the All Blacks, Australia's cricket team, English Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur, the Prada Yachting team and French Ligue One side AS Monaco.She can also lay claim to having won back-to-back Rugby World Cups with different nations, first with England in 2003 and South Africa four years later. Former Springboks winger Bryan Habana thanked her for making his eyes as quick as his feet.Habana would throw a rugby ball at an elastic net in a frame that returned the ball at a variety of angles and on one particular day caught and threw the ball 118 times in a minute.Calder says that the winger's intercepted try against Argentina in the semifinals of the 2007 Rugby World Cup won the Springboks the tournament and was proof that, in subtle ways, visual training impacted the performance.\"Elite athletes think they're good at everything. They think they're perfect, especially when it comes to visual motor skill level,\" Calder says, smiling.\"We show them they have strengths and weaknesses and it's really exciting for us to make every player a little bit better.\"Future of Performance: Eat, sleep and work out like the athlete of the future Future of Performance: Leverkusen explore the future of techEls won his second Claret Jug in 2012, ending a 10-year wait.The digital decline The professional athlete of today lives in a different era to the stars who were idolized in years gone by. The digital age, the habitual use of social media, the soaking up of information from a small screen, has created new problems. Calder says she has scientific evidence which suggests that skills and visual awareness, such as the processing of information, concentration, co-ordination, to name a few, are in decline.Those in the \"better-in-my-day\" camp, bemoaning that today's ball players haven't the flair or the skill of their predecessors, may have been on to something after all.Sport's best of the best, as are the rest of us, are suffering from digital deterioration courtesy of our irresistible digital devices.\"We've found in the last five to six years there's been an overall decline in the visual motor skill level of elite players,\" she says.\"The eyes were never designed to work on small devices and, because of that, we're really abusing how we should be using our eyes.\"When you look at your phone there is limited eye movements happening and everything is pretty static.\"When we're on digital devices we really have limited attention span so our ability to concentrate and pay attention to a specific task is deteriorating.\"Any system you don't use effectively or abuse deteriorates so we think that every person in the world should be doing some form of eye/brain  training to prevent the decline of the system.\"Looking up to the furthest point you can focus on helps, and therefore looking up now and again would be a start. However you need to specifically train that system.\"'We're trying to change behavior'Calder admits that she sees elite athletes on their smartphones or iPads \"all the time.\" Over the next three years with England's rugby union squad, as the country builds to the 2019 Rugby World Cup, she will attempt to alter habits. \"We're trying to change behavior and any behavior-change takes time,\" she says. \"By the time we get to the World Cup we'll be ready to perform.\"Players have been told not to use their devices on match day, while they have been asked to reduce their digital consumption during training weeks.What will the long-term impact of this digital decline have on sporting performance? Particular sports won't suffer more than others because, says Calder, the decline is across the board.\"People don't notice because everyone's doing the same,\" she says.\"In 10 years' time the situation might be better, I'm sure it's going to evolve. The awareness of the problem is starting to surface.\"You have to find a way of training the visual motor system -- that's really the only thing you can do.\"Training the eyes at the gymIt is winter in England and Calder is overseeing her first training sessions as England's visual awareness coach, an appointment made by head coach Eddie Jones this January. The Six Nations, which England will go on to win undefeated, is just weeks away. During her initial on-field exercises, she notices one player in particular is poor at catching the ball whenever it falls from on high.Here is one his country's best, a player of considerable talents, but his ability to judge distance and space is not up to standard.\"He was really bad at judging where the ball was in space,\" Calder recalls.\"If out of 10 balls you always drop three, it puts pressure on you as a player.\"If you can't catch high balls, there's a tendency to think that's just the way it is, but we show them it's something that can be improved.\"Once it is improved they begin to refine their skill and can move to the next level -- they can also improve the skill of having more time on the ball. The earlier you see, the more time you have to make a decision. That's a trainable skill.\"Calder's role with England, the world's second-best side, for the next 12 months is to improve how the backs -- the team's creatives, the speedsters -- see the game.Next year she will work with the remaining squad members, bringing the granite-jawed forwards onto her roster.This year she has twice flown from her South African base to Pennyhill Park, a luxurious complex west of London where Jones and his men hold training camps, and will work in person with the squad again this autumn. In her absence, the players are told to go to the gym -- Calder's EyeGym, an online program developed over the last 20 years which contains 60 varieties of drills, each adapted to the individual. The EyeGym, says Calder, is an antidote to the visual system's digital decline and the beauty of the software is that this in-demand coach can monitor results wherever in the world she may be. Players can also train anywhere in the world. Calder has worked with Eddie Jones perviously when the Australian was head coach of JapanThe EyeGym is akin to a computer game, but based on science -- objects whizz up and down and across the screen, testing the user's reactions, memory, coordination, peripheral and special awareness.It is the EyeGym that F1 driver Bottas uses before he gets into an F1 car, training the eyes on a specially-devised warm-up drill.\"If you make a mistake in F1 it is a lot more crucial than in, for instance, a rugby game so we make sure he's ready to perform by getting the visual system fit and ready to respond to anything happening around him,\" explains Calder. It is the EyeGym which has also helped stop the aforementioned rugby union player, who Calder prefers not to name, from wobbling under the high ball.\"He's been one of our greatest trainers,\" says Calder.\"We're still working with him. It's like a fitness skill. We train these skills and we get them up to standard and we top it up all the time. Once you get a skill up to standard there's always something else you have to work on.\"If we make each player on the field make one better decision per match, that could be 22 better decisions in the game.\"Sometimes when the players are tired and fatigued we put them on the training system because that's often when you have to perform. \"The eyes and the brain get tired, just as the body does. Often with elite players we find that physically they're in good shape, but if they lose concentration they make mistakes -- not because they technically can't do it but the visual system is giving them information either too slowly or inaccurately. \"The eyes get tired and they start to misjudge. It's not always because you're physically tired.\"The A-star students, such as former England outside-half Jonny Wilkinson, whom Calder describes as \"one of the greatest trainers I've ever worked with,\" will do extra sessions.Few, Calder understands, possess Wilkinson's relentless drive for self-improvement and so demands a minimum of 10-minute sessions three times a week.Seeing things differently Calder first noticed she saw things differently while playing field hockey in Europe during her country's sporting isolation in the apartheid era. \"People would ask 'how do you do that?' 'how do you see that?' I presumed they all saw what I saw,\" says Calder, describing how she would be first to the ball even when she was not the fittest or the quickest on the pitch.  \"Most people said I was born with those skills and I'd say I wasn't, that I actually trained them by being inquisitive and testing out things.\"After 50 Tests for South Africa she retired in 1996 to start her research into how the eyes affect performance, working with athletes from different sports and various countries.\"I decided to take the way I trained and put it into a training program,\" she says. \"I proved in my research that if you train your eyes in a certain way and you train on the field in a certain way, if you combine the two you can improve performance.\"As I've tested elite players, I've asked certain players to tell me about how they grew up and I've found that skills in different countries are different.\"The countries where athletes grew up playing outside had better skills in certain components, but were lacking in other components.JUST WATCHEDHow beet juice could win the Champions LeagueReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHow beet juice could win the Champions League 02:47\"If you've grown up playing outside, you've got better coordination, better peripheral, awareness of depth, where you should be reaching, eye-hand, eye-foot co-ordination. Just decision-making really.\"People don't play outside anymore. I think kids should be playing outside, climbing trees, jumping over fences, walking on walls, falling off, getting back on, learning to do it again.\"Calder's influence is not solely fixed on judging where a ball is going to be or the line and length of a putt. She trains a vast section of society, from business people to students and schoolchildren.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news and features \"We work with everyone, normal guys on the streets, a lot of kids, a lot of older people on memory skills. We work with big corporates on productivity because with concentration skills declining the productivity has also come down.\"If you use your eyes you should be training them, you should be keeping them fit. It applies to everyone.\"",

Sargeant is understood to have taken his own life, CNN affiliate ITN and the UK Press Association reported. North Wales Police told CNN on Tuesday that they were not treating his death as suspicious and that the matter has been referred to the coroner. Sargeant, 49, was minister for communities and children in the Welsh Assembly, the elected parliament for Wales, until he was suspended from Labour party membership and \"removed\" from the Assembly's cabinet last Friday. In a statement on Friday, Sargeant said he was told by First Minister Carwyn Jones about the existence of \"shocking and distressing\" allegations against him, but said he had not been given details about the claims. He said he had asked for an independent inquiry \"to allow me to clear my name.\"Read More\"I won't be commenting further at this stage,\" he added.Personal Statement pic.twitter.com/6VEOtGtj2Z\u2014 Carl Sargeant (@carlsargeant1) November 3, 2017\n\nSargeant, who was married and had two children, was a \"much loved husband, father and friend,\" his family said in a statement to PA. The news of Sargeant's death represents a tragic twist to a growing sexual harassment scandal that has shaken British politics.At least seven Conservative lawmakers and three Labour politicians have been accused of inappropriate behavior towards female staff and colleagues. These include UK Prime Minister Theresa May's de facto deputy, Damian Green, who has denied allegations that \"extreme\" pornographic material was found on his work computer in 2008.Green is also set to be interviewed as part of a Cabinet Office inquiry into allegations made by journalist Kate Maltby that the Conservative lawmaker made unwanted advances towards her during a meeting in 2015. Green described the allegations as \"completely untrue\" last week.May is also still recovering from the loss of her Defence Secretary Michael Fallon, who resigned on Wednesday amid allegations of improper conduct. Journalist Jane Merrick, who is a contributor to CNN, revealed that Fallon lunged at her and attempted to kiss her on the lips after a lunch meeting in 2003.May held a meeting Monday night to look at ways to protect political staff.On Tuesday, British opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn tweeted: \"I'm deeply shocked to hear of the terrible news about Carl Sargeant. My thoughts and profound sympathy are with his family and friends.\"I'm deeply shocked to hear of the terrible news about Carl Sargeant. My thoughts and profound sympathy are with his family and friends.\u2014 Jeremy Corbyn (@jeremycorbyn) November 7, 2017\n\nDeputy Labour leader Tom Watson told the Press Association: \"I campaigned with Carl for many years. He was a powerful voice for working people and Wales. He put community at the heart of his politics and was respected by his constituents for it. My love and prayers are with Carl's family today. This is a tragedy beyond words.\"His biography on the website of the Welsh National Assembly says he was married with two children.Before becoming an Assembly Member in 2003, Sargeant worked at a leading chemical manufacturing plant and was an environmental auditor and industrial firefighter.He was a campaigner against domestic abuse and a supporter of the local women's shelter and the \"White Ribbon\" campaign by men to end violence in the home, according to the Welsh Assembly website.",

'It's a dream to even just ride in the race, but to win it again? I'm lost for words.\"Brown previously won the Melbourne Cup in 2009 racing on Shocking.Twenty-four horses tore up the track at Melbourne's famous Flemington racecourse in an attempt to win the coveted cup, which comes with a prize pool of $4.8 million (A$6.2 million).Read MoreAustralia's Melbourne Cup: From ridiculed tea set to treasured trophyKnown as \"the race that stops a nation,\" workplaces and schools across Australia regularly grind to a halt every November to watch the event.Run over 3,200 meters, the race was first held in 1861 and is now regularly attended by tens of thousands of racegoers. The event has grown so large it is now a public holiday in parts of Australia.O'Brien is the son of famed Irish trainer Aidan O'Brien, whose horse Johannes Vermeer came in second to his son's stallion. \"I can't quite believe it, this is unbelievable,\" Joseph told Channel 7 reporters.Ahead of the race, British horse Marmelo and German thoroughbred Almandin were favorites to win in what was considered a fairly open field.Tens of thousands of people from across Melbourne flocked to Flemington Tuesday dressed in suits, frocks and elaborate hats. For many people, Melbourne Cup day is a chance to show off the latest fashion, and there's stiff competition for the best dressed.Racegoers enjoy the atmosphere on Melbourne Cup Day at Flemington Racecourse on November 7.Celebrations around Tuesday's race were marred by protesters attempting to draw attention to the plight of refugees trapped without food or water in a recently closed detention center in Manus Island, Papua New Guinea.Local media reported protesters had parked a car across train tracks leading to the Flemington race track, covered in messages saying \"Evacuate Manus.\"Meanwhile other demonstrators climbed a crane close to the race course to display a banner reading \"SOS: Evacuated Manus now.\"The women climbers view from the crane & message to @TurnbullMalcolm @PeterDutton_MP #SOS #EvacuateManus #Justice4Refugees #MelbouneCup pic.twitter.com/cphbKVCAE9\u2014 WACA (@akaWACA) November 7, 2017\n\nThe race is also regularly the focus of complaints over animal cruelty, ranging from the whipping of horses during the race to the euthanizing of animals injured during the run.Three-time Melbourne Cup runner up Red Cadeaux was euthanised after he was injured during the 2015 Melbourne Cup, shocking racegoers.According to Australia's Royal Society for the Protection of Animals, the racing industry doesn't provide a full accounting of the number of injured or euthanized horses every year.List of horse protection orgs & rescues to donate to instead of placing a bet: https://t.co/mHJLllplXW#MelbourneCup #LoveHorsesNotRacing pic.twitter.com/b8rKvTuTfQ\u2014 Animals Australia (@AnimalsAus) November 7, 2017",

A year later he won the title again, with 13 race victories -- the most by any premier class rider -- beating a record held since 1997 by the legendary Mick Doohan.  Follow @cnnsport\n\nThen, in 2016, he became the youngest rider to win three MotoGP world titles.This weekend, in Valencia, Spain, the Repsol Honda rider will fight for a fourth premier class title, his sixth across the sport's classes. With a 21-point lead in the standings, he is hot favorite to take motorcycle racing's ultimate prize yet again.If all this sounds like plain sailing for the 24-year-old Catalan, this season has been anything but. Six races into the campaign he had managed just a single win -- at the Grand Prix of the Americas in Austin -- and had failed to finish in two other races.Read More\"I knew we could have a difficult start [to the season]\" Marquez told CNN Sport. \"We had made important changes to the engine and we needed time to understand how it worked, but I always try to be positive.\"JUST WATCHEDThe United States F1 Grand PrixReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe United States F1 Grand Prix 22:52READ: Andrea Dovizioso keeps title dream alive in MalaysiaREAD: Lewis Hamilton wins fourth F1 titleREAD: Alonso to fulfill Daytona 24 hours ambition'Good feelings'Positivity flows from Marquez. In person, his infectious grin is only rarely absent.  He laughs spontaneously and often. Members of the Marquez family mingle happily with his Repsol Honda team, and the atmosphere in his garage is focused but warm.\"I trust the potential of my team and the factory and I know that they always work hard to achieve the best level possible,\" he explains. \"They have shown one more year that all together we can overcome any situation.\"Overcome it they did.  From the sixth round onwards Marquez chalked up five race wins and four other podiums, moving up the standings before tightening his grip on the championship. \"The improvements that we've made to the setup during the season helped me to feel so much more comfortable on the bike,\" he says.\"And when you have good feelings, you have more confidence, and this allows you to push to the limit.\"JUST WATCHEDJenson Button on yellow sunglasses and sweetsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHJenson Button on yellow sunglasses and sweets 02:17Formidable DucatiThe surprise this season has come in the form of Ducati and 31-year-old Andrea Dovizioso, who remains in contention ahead of this Sunday's final race.  Marquez says the reinvigorated Italian outfit has become a formidable package. \"We all knew that Ducati had a very good bike for certain circuits,\" he says. \"But what has impressed us this year was that they took a big step in those circuits where they used to struggle more. This shows that they have been working hard to be in front. Lately, when you follow a Ducati, it's hard to see weak points.\"The gracious and unassuming Dovizioso is widely liked in the paddock, and that cordiality extends to Marquez. For fans a new face near the top of the standings has been a refreshing change, but Marquez says he pays little attention to who he is racing against. \"The most important thing for me is to be one of the riders who are battling in front,\" he says. \"Honestly, I don't care if I fight with this or this other rider, I care about giving my best and try to win. \"That said, I have a good relationship with Dovi and I've enjoyed fighting with him in the track this season. He's been a tough opponent.\"JUST WATCHEDFormula E gears up for season 4 ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFormula E gears up for season 4  02:43Rossi fans have not forgivenThe battle between Marquez and Dovizioso has occasionally threatened to sour that relationship this season, with the world champion's uncompromising style testing its boundaries. The overall atmosphere, however, is of genial mutual respect. It's a stark contrast to Marquez's battles with nine-time world champion Valentino Rossi, which threatened to tear the championship apart two seasons ago.The 38-year-old Italian appears to have buried the hatchet with Marquez, but many in his legion of fans have yet to forgive the Catalan for his brushes with \"The Doctor,\" which some maintain prevented their idol from claiming a tenth crown. It is not uncommon to hear boos when Marquez takes to the podium. Marquez is philosophical about the ongoing rancor. \"I don't know [if the boos will stop],\" he says. \"It is said that 'time cures all,' but I try not to think a lot about this. I'm focused on my work to do my best and make happy the people who cheer for me which, fortunately, are a lot.\"Spain awaits its Catalan kingAs a Catalan preparing to race in Spain, there is another interesting dimension to Sunday's race: if Marquez finds himself on the podium celebrating a championship win, will the political turmoil in the country cross his mind?  Perhaps sensibly, the man from Cervera is not being drawn into the debate. \"I wish I will be in the podium,\" he says. \"Because this would mean that we've reached our goal and I would be very happy for that.\"Visit cnn.com/motorsport for more news and videosOne thing is for sure, a fourth premier class title this weekend will see both Spain and Catalonia keener than ever to claim Marquez as one of their own.",

It is one my favorites on image alone but, for me, it holds a special place in my heart because 2012 was the first time I had ever been to Japan, the home of judo, and it was my first visit to the legendary Tokyo Grand Slam.

There were no distress calls, the sheriff's office said.A photo of Roy Halladay and his A5 airplane that he posted to Twitter.Icon A5s are considered light, amphibious airplanes.

One post said: \"I have dreamed about owning a A5 since I retired! Real life is better then (sic) my dreams!!\"In a statement following the crash, Icon called Halladay a \"great advocate and friend\" and said the company \"will do everything it can to support the accident investigation going forward and we will comment further when more information is available.\"          Halladay pitched parts of 16 seasons in the major leagues, the first 12 with the Toronto Blue Jays. He won the Cy Young for the Jays in 2003, when he went 22-7 with a 3.25 ERA and led the American League with nine complete games. He was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies before the 2010 season and won another Cy Young in his first year with the team. That season he went 21-10 with a 2.44 ERA and threw a perfect game in the regular season and a no-hitter in his first postseason start. The no-hitter is the only one in National League postseason history.\"There are no words to describe the sadness that the entire Phillies family is feeling over the loss of one of the most respected human beings to ever play the game,\" a team statement said.  \"It is with the heaviest of hearts that we pass along our condolences to (his wife) Brandy, (and sons) Ryan and Braden.\"    My heart hurts writing this. I can still remember the first day we met. It was 5:45am on the first day of spring training when I arrived. He was finishing his breakfast but his clothes were soaking wet.

Thank you Roy for allowing us to witness what it takes to be the best. We will all miss you. A post shared by @therealchaseutley on Nov 7, 2017 at 2:32pm PST\nThe Blue Jays said the club was grief stricken by \"the tragic loss of one of the franchise's greatest and most respected players, but even better human being.\"Halladay finished his career with a 203 wins and a career ERA of 3.38. Hall of Famer Pedro Martinez said he would watch while his opponent threw.\"I can't believe it.

PRAYERS for his whole family!!\"Halladay will be eligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2019. The National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the crash. According to the website of the Federal Aviation Administration, the certification for the plane was issued Monday, meaning the aircraft was brand new.In May there was a crash of an A5 in California that killed both people on board. The NTSB ruled pilot error was the cause.CNN's Jamiel Lynch, Aaron Cooper, Chris Boyette, Amanda Jackson, Danielle Hackett and David Close contributed to this report.",

On September 10, 2017, Steinhaus made history in Germany by becoming the first female to officiate a top-level league match.The setting was iconic too -- Berlin's 74,000-capacity Olympiastadion has hosted Olympic Games, World Cup matches and a Champions League final.\"It actually gives me goosebumps now as I'm thinking back to it,\" Steinhaus says, running her hand up her forearm.

This is the same organization, after all, that still banned women from taking part in football as recently as the 1950s.Germany's female equivalent of the Bundesliga, the Allianz Frauen-Bundesliga, is now one of the most organized and competitive leagues in the women's game.No country can boast as many Champions League winners, with Frankfurt, Turbine Potsdam, Wolfsburg and Duisburg having won the competition a total of nine times. Frankfurt hold the joint all-time record of four along with Lyon.Though Steinhaus, Germany and football as a whole are making steps forwards -- she is keen to emphasize that every fourth official in the group stages of the recent Under-17 World Cup was female -- sexism inevitably still persists.One Spanish newspaper recently wrote an article about Karolina Bojar, a Polish referee officiating in her country's men's youth league. The headline read: \"Karolina Bojar, Europe's sexiest referee is a Barcelona fan.\" This of a woman who, as well as refereeing, is a law student and an accomplished 800m and 1,500m runner.Steinhaus herself has been subjected to sexism while on the field of play.In 2015, during a second division game in Germany, she sent off Fortuna Dusseldorf's Kerem Demirbay for two \"reckless\" yellow cards.Upon receiving his red card, Demirbay turned to Steinhaus and told her: \"Women have no place in men's football.\"JUST WATCHEDFootball at 19,000 feet for equalityReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFootball at 19,000 feet for equality 01:15She filed the incident in her match report and Demirbay's own club took disciplinary action against him, suspending him for five matches and making him referee a junior girls' match.\"If you're not fine with women around you, you don't have to play,\" Steinhaus says matter-of-factly. \"It's your choice, right? \"The federation is always promoting the game for male, for females, for youngsters and grassroots. This is the way it should be and so that's why I reported the comment. \"If you think that way, you don't belong on my football field.\" Steinhaus was again in the news at the beginning of this season -- before she had refereed her first Bundesliga match -- in what was then the biggest game of her career.During Bayern Munich's German Cup victory over Chemnitzer, winger Franck Ribery, while bending over to put the ball on the ground, untied Steinhaus' shoelaces.The Frenchman had never before or has never since done the same to a male referee. It is put to Steinhaus that this prank could be seen as a sign of disrespect, though she disagrees.\"I would handle the situation with Franck Ribery again in the way that I did,\" she explains.\"Because it didn't feel like he wanted to underestimate my respect as a referee.

I'm not a very successful football player,\" she quips. \"So I picked up the whistle and just gave it a try.\"It was important, she believes, for her dad to teach her from an early age that not everything in football is positive, which may explain how she was able to deal with Dermibay's sexism so calmly.JUST WATCHEDKaren Bardsley: Manchester Derby is a 'battle for rights'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH (15 Videos)Karen Bardsley: Manchester Derby is a 'battle for rights'Is this the year Ajax reclaim European supremacy?Teqball World Championships pave the way for Olympics inclusionAlexia Putellas is hungry for more success in 2022Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 is hungry for more World Cup success in QatarKylian Mbappe on playing alongside Messi at PSG and what's in store for his futureTackling discrimination on a Chelsea matchdayAdnan Januzaj on Real Sociedad's rise in La LigaQatar 2022: How a unique World Cup will play out as seen from the air\ufeffAxel Witsel: \ufeffBorussia Dortmund's elder statesman\ufeffKhalida Popal and Andrea Radrizzani on evacuating the Afghan women's soccer teamGianni Infantino sees 'great evolution' in Qatar human rightsPeter Schmeichel: I want the next coach to 'get Manchester United under his skin'Lilian Thuram says players need to walk off the pitch when subjected to racial abuse\ufeffThe footballer who changed his shirt number to highlight the climate crisis\"He definitely showed me what to expect as a referee,\" she says. \"There are not only good sides of the game, so that's a message I want to give out to everybody that's involved in football: Just treat each other with respect.\"From local amateur games, women's football and through the ranks to the highest level, there isn't much Steinhaus hasn't seen.The full-time, professional Bundesliga referee sounds just as enthusiastic about her profession as the amateur who just refereed for fun all those years ago. \"I still think it's the best occupation in the world,\" she says, again smiling broadly. \"So I have the passion and I just love what I'm doing and so I continued doing it and progressed over the years, from one level to the next and this ... kind of guided me to the Bundesliga.\"Enjoying the momentJUST WATCHEDNagelsmann: Meet Hoffenheim's 'Baby Mourinho'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNagelsmann: Meet Hoffenheim's 'Baby Mourinho' 03:26Steinhaus agrees that it's fair to say most kids dream of becoming footballers, and far fewer dream of becoming referees.They are forced to make split-second decisions, which are then scrutinized relentlessly by fans, managers and players, who usually make their judgments with the benefit of television replays.But now she is in the limelight and a role model to many -- a \"beautiful\" position to be in but one, she admits, that also brings \"pressure\" -- what advice would Steinhaus give the young girls and boys who can picture themselves in the middle of the pitch wearing black?\"If you want to be part of this beautiful game and if you find your way to refereeing, grab the opportunity, go for it, take the whistle,\" she says, repeatedly punching her fist into her palm.\"It was one of the best decisions in my life.

The Melbourne Cup  on display during the  Melbourne Cup Carnival Launch at Flemington Racecourse on October 30, 2017.\"The 1915 Cup trophy was the last one made in the UK after it was delayed in arriving to the Melbourne Cup Carnival that year,\" said Joe McGrath, VRC Racing Engagements and Cup Tour Manager, who is also known as the \"Keeper of the Cup.\"\"This was due to the outbreak of World War One, which saw enemy destroyers parked in the Indian Ocean.\"Read MoreThe VRC engaged Melbourne-based William Drummond & Co. to manufacture the trophy, and Drummonds selected Australia's leading gold and silversmith James Steeth to design and create it.\"James did beautiful work. He just had the hands for it. Everyone in the industry I met used to say of Jimmy that he was a real craftsman,\" said Fortunato \"Lucky\" Rocca, who joined J.W. Steeth and Son as an apprentice in 1962 and went on to make 30 Melbourne Cup trophies of his own.READ: After 168 years, is the Melbourne Cup finally going home?Iconic designIt took Steeth three years to settle upon today's iconic three-handled design, which represents the relationship between the winning trainer, jockey and owner.\"In 1916, Steeth made a gold bowl in an art-deco style with similar dimensions to today's trophy. I would call it the prototype,\" said Andrew Lemon, a consultant historian to Victoria Racing Club (VRC), host of the Melbourne Cup.The following year, Steeth added a stem to elevate the base, plus two handles.\"It's a slightly cruder version of what we have today; while it's obviously an attractive object, it doesn't have the elegance of the three-handled version that appeared in 1919,\" said Lemon, who wrote the three-volume History of Australian Thoroughbred Racing.When James Steeth passed away in 1959, his son Maurice Steeth, a fine-arts lecturer and Australian silver expert, took over the family business.READ: Police plan for 'hostile incursion' at Melbourne Cup Maurice Steeth took over from his father James as the designer behind the Melbourne Cup.\"I don't remember a lot about my grandfather, but I was very involved with my father's work and spent a lot of time with him in his workshop,\" said Maurice Steeth's daughter, Anne O'Donoghue, an immigration lawyer in Sydney.Her childhood memories include weekend expeditions to her father's gold mine, which Maurice bought and mined as a hobby, and peering into his safe to see golden candelabras that had been gifted from the likes of Queen Victoria and Lord Melbourne.Rocca also has fond memories of his boss, who allowed them to stop work to listen to the race on the radio in the years before Melbourne Cup day was made a public holiday in Victoria.\"Maurice was strict, but we got along famously,\" he said.O'Donoghue said if he father hadn't died suddenly of a heart attack when she was 17, she too would have gone into the business.\"He saw me as another Hester Bateman, the well-known English silversmith who was also a woman,\" O'Donoghue said. \"But back then, it was a barrier for women to get into that kind of business.\"Instead, Rocca took over the family owned company and made the Melbourne Cup trophies for 30 years, from 1970 until 2000.Flemington Park hosts the Melbourne Cup. 'A dying art'To mark the centenary of the Melbourne Cup trophy in 2019, O'Donoghue plans to launch a foundation that includes an artisan scholarship to help preserve what she describes as a \"dying art.\"Rocca believes he is the only craftsman left in Australia who continues to fashion trophies by hand.\"The trophies of today aren't what they used to be. Techniques change over the years; that's what happens over a long period of time. I don't blame people for going that way -- it's just the way of the world. But as time goes on, this craft will die out,\" he told CNN.Kerrin McEvoy and Almandin beat Joao Moreira on Heartbreak City to win the 2016 Melbourne Cup.The difference, he admits, is almost imperceptible, but important nonetheless. \"It's like buying a suit from a shop where a machine has made it, or getting a nice suit that has been made to order. They look the same; they probably feel the same, but there's just a bit more character about a handmade suit, because someone has put in the time and effort and has actually thought about it, rather than a machine thinking for you.\"That's not to say that the current Melbourne Cup trophy, which is made from 1.65 kilograms of gold and is valued at more than $200,000 Australian (US$152,000), isn't made without painstaking care.

This technique is slightly different to how Lucky (Rocca) would have manufactured the Cup,\" said Nicola Evans, Pallion's Marketing Manager.Past techniques, such as using fragments of rhino horn to smooth the insides of the cup, resulted in quite strong differentiations between individual trophies, whereas now it's quite difficult to tell different trophies apart, according to Lemon. \"The Melbourne Cup is still surprisingly meaningful to a very large cross-section of Australia. There's a value to it that is over and above the price of gold,\" he said.Visit CNN.com/horseracing for more news, features and videos.",

        "content": "London (CNN)The sexual harassment scandal that has rocked British politics took a new twist Saturday after one of Britain's most senior ministers denied allegations that \"extreme\" pornographic material was found on his work computer in 2008. Damian Green, the first secretary of state and effectively Prime Minister Theresa May's deputy, said the story, which was first reported in The Sunday Times, was \"completely untrue and comes from a tainted and untrustworthy source.\"According to The Sunday Times, former Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick alleged that the material was discovered on one of Green's parliamentary computers by police officers conducting an inquiry into government leaks in 2008.\"The allegations about the material and computer, now nine years old, are false, disreputable political smears from a discredited police officer acting in flagrant breach of his duty to keep the details of police investigations confidential, and amount to little more than an unscrupulous character assassination,\" Green said in a statement published on Twitter. The allegations against Green come on the same day that journalist and CNN contributor Jane Merrick revealed that former Defence Secretary Michael Fallon lunged at her and attempted to kiss her on the lips after a lunch meeting in 2003.Michael Fallon resigned from his position as defense minister last week.Read MoreFallon resigned from his post last Wednesday, the day after admitting he had touched the knee of journalist Julia Hartley-Brewer at a conference dinner 15 years ago.Merrick, who was 29 at the time, wrote in the Observer that she felt \"humiliated, ashamed.\" She added: \"Was I even guilty that maybe I had led him on in some way by drinking with him? After years of having a drink with so many other MPs who have not acted inappropriately towards me, I now know I was not.\"Thank you to the dozens of people who have expressed their support. For those who want to criticise, please read the whole article first.\u2014 Jane Merrick (@janemerrick23) November 5, 2017\n\nMerrick said she phoned Downing Street at 5 p.m. on Wednesday to report the incident to one of the Prime Minister's aides -- by 7.30 p.m. Fallon had resigned.The latest revelations will come as a hammer blow to Prime Minister May, who will meet with fellow party leaders later this week to discuss plans for tackling sexual harassment and abuse in Parliament.Speaking on \"The Andrew Marr Show\" on Sunday, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said there will be a \"clear-out\" in Westminster after the avalanche of claims.\"I know that the Cabinet Office is going to be looking at this tomorrow along with the wider inquiry about Damian, and I do think that we shouldn't rush to allege anything until that inquiry has taken place,\" she added.Further allegationsSaturday's allegations against Green come days after he was accused by journalist Kate Maltby of making unwanted advances toward her during a meeting in 2015.Writing in The Times of London newspaper on Wednesday, Maltby said: \"He offered me career advice and in the same breath made it clear he was sexually interested. It was not acceptable to me at the time and it should not be acceptable behavior in Westminster in the future.\"She said Green, who was a friend of the family nearly 30 years her senior, had \"steered the conversation to the habitual nature of sexual affairs in Parliament,\" before mentioning that \"his own wife was very understanding.\"She added: \"I felt a fleeting hand against my knee -- so brief, it was almost deniable. I moved my legs away, and tried to end the drink on friendly terms.\"One Conservative lawmaker has called for Green to be suspended pending an investigation.Green described those allegations as \"completely untrue\" and \"deeply hurtful\" in a statement Wednesday. He added: \"This untrue allegation has come as a complete shock and is deeply hurtful, especially from someone I considered a personal friend.\"Maltby, who also contributes to CNN, said she had dropped all contact with Green after the encounter. But in May last year, she said, he contacted her by text message after seeing a piece she had written for The Times on the history of corsets that included an image of her wearing one.According to Maltby, Green's text message read: \"Long time no see. But having admired you in a corset in my favorite tabloid I feel impelled to ask if you are free for a drink anytime?\"UK PM's deputy denies sexual harassment claimsMaltby said she had ignored the message but had since had contact with Green on a professional basis.\"Awkward relationships like this are part of being a young woman in Westminster,\" she wrote. \"It shouldn't be the norm -- which is why I have chosen to speak out. But it's crucial to understand that most of us have to maintain relationships with such men in order to thrive professionally.\"Fellow Conservative lawmaker Anna Soubry has called for Green to be suspended while the investigation takes place.May has launched an investigation into the allegations made by Maltby, while a number of other Conservative lawmakers have also found themselves facing investigation.Labour Party allegationsThe allegations of sexual abuse and harassment are not confined to one party, with the Labour Party also being criticized for its handling of the issue.Labour lawmaker Kelvin Hopkins has denied any wrongdoing.Last week, Labour activist Ava Etemadzadeh said the party took three years to act after she informed them that MP Kelvin Hopkins, 76, made inappropriate physical contact with her and sent her unprofessional text messages. In a statement issued by his solicitors and reported by the UK Press Association, Hopkins said: \"I absolutely categorically deny that I in any way engaged in such inappropriate conduct.\"A recent investigation has also been launched into the case of Bex Bailey, a former Labour activist, who revealed she was raped at a party event at age 19, and was discouraged from reporting the attack by a senior official. Bailey did not name her attacker.There is also a complaint against lawmaker Clive Lewis who is accused of groping a woman at the party's annual conference. Lewis strenuously denies the allegation.The claims come in the wake of the scandal involving accusations of sexual assault and harassment against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, and the #MeToo campaign, in which victims of sexual abuse have been sharing their experiences.",

He has said he's not fleeing the Spanish court system but instead is seeking European support for his region's independence bid.Puigdemont tweeted Saturday that he and his associates are \"prepared to fully cooperate with Belgian justice following the European arrest warrant issued by Spain.\"Spain was plunged into its worst political crisis in decades after Puigdemont's administration held an independence referendum October 1 despite the nation's highest court banning the move.The Catalan parliament then declared unilateral independence, and Madrid responded by suspending the region's autonomy, sacking the government and imposing direct rule.Read MoreCarmen Lamela, a judge in Spain's National Court, asked Belgium's prosecutor's office to arrest Puidgemont and four ministers in the dissolved Catalan government who ignored a court order to appear before a judge Thursday. Deposed Catalan leader 'not seeking asylum in Belgium'The charges include sedition, rebellion, misuse of funds, abuse of authority and contempt. The other four named in warrants are Toni Comin, Clara Ponsati, Lluis Puig and Meritxell Serret. Belgian prosecutor Eric Van der Sypt said he has received the arrest warrants for Puigdemont and the others.Van der Sypt told CNN in a telephone interview he would study the warrants and hand them over to an investigating judge within the next three days.Next stepsA statement from the Belgian federal prosecutor's office Saturday set out the next steps in the process, which could take weeks. Once those named are found and brought before the judge, he or she has 24 hours to make a decision on what to do next, the statement said.JUST WATCHEDHow Catalonia's independence crisis unfoldedReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHow Catalonia's independence crisis unfolded 02:24The judge can decide whether or not to issue an arrest warrant, and, if a warrant is issued, can decide whether the person concerned should be held or released under certain conditions.If the judge issues an arrest warrant, then a court has 15 days to decide whether it is executed or not. The parties involved can then lodge an appeal, to be decided within 15 days, and potentially a further appeal to a higher court, also to be ruled on within 15 days.The issuance of the warrant for Puigdemont's arrest was expected but still increases the tension between Catalan leaders and the Spanish national government, which so far has thwarted the region's drive to independence.Puigdemont and 13 former ministers were ordered to appear before the Spanish high court Thursday. Of the nine former officials who showed up, eight were detained and one was freed on bond.Puigdemont didn't appear and issued a video message calling the court's action \"an attack on democracy.\" He and some of his former ministers turned up in Brussels earlier this week after Spain's state prosecutor announced he would seek charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds against them.The arrest warrant issued Friday also said Puidgemont would not be allowed to testify via videoconference from Belgium.

I would not countenance this going forward. \"I don't want to play NASCAR globally. I just don't,\" Marchionne said referring to the American racing series where the cars are largely the same and the races tend to be a lot closer than Formula One. Ferrari is synonymous with F1 and, after 68 seasons, they are the most successful team in the sport's history with 16 constructors championships and 15 drivers titles.They have threatened to pull out of the sport before but never under Marchionne's leadership and he is adamant that he is prepared to withdraw when their contract ends in 2020. \"The fact that we now appear to be at odds in terms of the strategic development of this thing, and we see the sport in 2021 taking on a different air, is going to force some decisions on the part of Ferrari,\" he said. \"You need to be absolutely clear that unless we find a set of circumstances the results of which are beneficial to the maintenance of the brand in the marketplace and to the strengthening of the unique position for Ferrari, Ferrari will not play.\"F1 team bosses are set to meet Liberty Media again on Tuesday for further talks.

His recent results have elevated him to superstar status back home -- some have likened him to Tiger Woods in his pomp -- but Matsuyama also cuts something of a mysterious figure.So little is known of the publicity shy 25-year-old that his fans and even the golf media were stunned when he announced in August he had got married at the start of the year and his wife had a baby girl in July.Hideki Matsuyama is pictured at the 2017 PGA Championship at Quail Hollow.Read MoreMatsuyama explained that he hadn't kept it a secret, just no one had ever asked him if he was married.\"He's very quiet, he doesn't show his emotions very much,\" Andy Yamanaka, executive director of the Japan Golf Association and a member of the golf committee for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, told CNN Sport.\"He's not comfortable speaking about himself to people he doesn't know, but he's a nice guy, a smart guy and he has a sense of humor.\"READ: Matsuyama looking forward to 'fun day' with Trump  JUST WATCHEDThe art of speed golf in ItalyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH (20 Videos)The art of speed golf in ItalyCarnoustie: Paul Lawrie's favorite courseMy favorite golf course: Real Golf de Pedre\u00f1aThe state of golf in MexicoTiger Woods' ideal day: 'Caddyshack,' oatmeal?Rory McIlroy: I will win the Masters Icelandic golfer's ANA Inspiration hole-in-oneGolf in India: The growth of the gameJavier Ballesteros on his father SeveGolf's hardest holes: The 14th at DLF GCCSergio Garcia on the Masters and his familySergio Garcia's magical yearRyder Cup: Europe's journey back to victoryFanny Sunesson's perfect dayThe CEO bringing millennials back to golfBjorn: Ryder Cup represents best of EuropeThomas Bjorn's perfect day?

That took Matsuyama to second in the world rankings behind Dustin Johnson, and he followed it up with fifth at the US PGA in August, after having led with nine holes to play.With five PGA Tour wins, including four in the last two seasons, Matsuyama's recent results have done his talking for him. He was also fourth on the PGA money list for 2017, having earned $8.3 million in prize money.\"He's probably one of the most respected athletes in Japan,\" says Yamanaka, who has known Matsuyama since he was 17 or 18. #Japan will roll out its No. 1 golfer Hideki Matsuyama and 'PPAP' singer Piko-Taro to entertain Trump next week https://t.co/EyCyE33yoM pic.twitter.com/mnZA6jpUwn\u2014 ST Foreign Desk (@STForeignDesk) October 30, 2017\n\nStill, his profile is much smaller than tennis player Kei Nishikori or colorful golfer Ryo Ishikawa, who made a big splash a few years ago.\"Matsuyama doesn't have a particularly big media profile. He doesn't particularly like doing interviews and he doesn't really do many endorsements or anything,\" says Andrew McKirdy, a Tokyo-based sportswriter for the Japan Times.\"A lot of people would've struggled to put a face to the name, but recently, because of the results he's had, the general Japanese public, not necessarily just golf fans, have come to know who he is and now have expectations of him.\"Hideki Matsuyama talks to the media at the Presidents Cup in September. 'Hype'Introduced to golf at the age of four by his father, Matsuyama became the first Japanese amateur to compete at the Masters, in 2011. He turned pro two years later and was soon playing on the PGA Tour. Based in America and with no English, he was accompanied by American Bob Turner, a Japanese translator to the likes of Tiger Woods and Seve Ballesteros, who went to university in Japan and is married to a Japanese woman.\"I am working on my English,\" Matsuyama told reporters at the Open in July. \"I think I am recognised a little more now in America but if I could speak good English more people would know my personality.\"On Tour, Matsuyama is followed by a regular Japanese press pack and a phalanx of often 20 or more photographers, who chart his every move from dawn until dusk. \"They literally follow every shot he hits, every day he plays in a tournament. Even with Tiger Woods at his height we'd never have done that,\" says veteran Getty Images photographer David Cannon.\"But it never gets aggressive, they are incredibly polite. When we were all following Tiger the hype was incredible.\"It's pleasant around Hideki, whereas around Tiger Woods it was somewhat unpleasant and aggressive. He played aggressively and it seemed to feed into the way everybody behaved. \"Hideki is deadpan, there is no emotion and that comes out in the way he's treated. It doesn't create the same hype but there is a hype of its own kind. He's exciting to photograph, but only as a golfer, not as a personality.\"Matsuyama won the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational in August for his fifth PGA Tour victory.'Extraordinary prospect'Matusyama's work ethic is famous, spending hours on the range or practice putting green before and after a round, irrespective of how he played.  \"He's a very hard worker and he's never satisfied with himself, even if he shoots 61 or 62,\" says Yamanaka. \"He doesn't forget one missed shot, one mistake. He always wants to be perfect.\"In all, Matsuyama has had seven top 10 finishes in majors and four top fives, and many observers think it is only a matter of time before he makes the major breakthrough.\"Matsuyama truly can lay claim to major winning potential after his performances in the last two years,\" says Shane O'Donoghue, host of CNN's Living Golf. \"The pressure and anticipation to deliver must be massive, but I fully expect him to get it done. He is an extraordinary prospect.\"READ: Lee Westwood reveals course design ambitionsMatsuyama has played in three Presidents Cups for the International team. South African Louis Oosthuizen, the 2010 Open champion, played with Matsuyama when he won the Hero World Challenge last year, and said afterwards: \"The iron play that I saw off him was close to spectacular.\"If he is really on song, especially in that part of his game, I would say he's as good as Tiger was with that part of the game.\"The next highest-ranked Japanese player is Yuta Ikeda at No. 40, so the focus on Matsuyama to land a major is understandable. Yet the pressure is like water off a duck's back, according to Yamanaka.\"He's not an emotional kind of guy. He never gets hot, he never gets depressed,\" says Yamanaka. \"That's one of his strongest points - - he knows how to control himself mentally and physically.\" READ: Golfer to make PGA Tour debut after surviving Las Vegas shootingShould Matsuyama clinch that first Japanese major, it could revolutionize the flagging golf scene at home, according to Yamanaka.\"It's going to be huge, huge news because we are facing problems,\" he says. \"The golf population is getting less and less and the majority of golfers are senior-aged people. \"We lack young people who play golf and we need someone like Hideki Matsuyama or [women's tour player] Ai Miyazato, who can give a dream to young kids and young people to make them think, 'I want to be like him or her.'\"We need an icon to represent Japanese golfers and Hideki Matsuyama is the one that can make it possible very shortly, we believe.\"Visit CNN.com/golf for more news, features and videosFirst, he needs to polish off President Trump.",

        "content": "(CNN)UK Defense Secretary Michael Fallon resigned on Wednesday, admitting that his past behavior towards women had \"fallen short\", as the swirl of allegations about sexual harassment in British politics intensified.Fallon's departure came after a journalist, Julia Hartley-Brewer, confirmed he had repeatedly placed his hand on her knee at a dinner in 2002.Hartley-Brewer has repeatedly said she did not regard the incident as harassment, but Fallon hinted in a statement that further allegations could be forthcoming.\"In recent days allegations have been made about MPs' conduct, including my own. Many of these have been false, but I realize that in the past I have fallen below the high standards that we require of the armed forces, which I have the privilege to represent.\"The decision is a blow for Prime Minister Theresa May, whose Cabinet is deeply divided over Brexit and whose minority government is propped up in the House of Commons by a small political party from Northern Ireland. Fallon was a key ally, and could be relied upon to provide loyal defenses of controversial policies in frequent media appearances. Read MoreEarlier this week, Fallon, 65, apologized to Hartley-Brewer for the 2002 incident. According to Hartley-Brewer, Fallon -- whom she did not name in her initial account -- withdrew his hand after she told him that if he continued, she would \"punch him in the face.\" She has repeatedly said that she does not believe herself to be a victim, writing on her Twitter account last week: \"He tried it on, I turned him down.

Earlier on Wednesday, May ordered an investigation into her deputy, Damian Green, amid allegations of unwanted advances toward a female writer. Green has denied the harassment claims.Last week, May ordered an investigation into international trade minister Mark Garnier, who reportedly admitted to a newspaper that he asked his personal assistant to buy sex toys and used a sexual slur against her.UK PM's deputy denies sexual harassment claimsThe recent allegations of sexual abuse in some British political circles have snowballed after the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke in October. The accusations against Hollywood movie producer Weinstein have led to a platform for victims of abuse around the world to share their experiences, through the viral #MeToo campaign. The Prime Minister's office has said all allegations of sexual harassment are to be taken seriously and has urged victims of assault and harassment to report it to the police. In a letter accepting Fallon's resignation on Wednesday, May praised his \"diligent service.\"She said: \"I appreciate the characteristically serious manner in which you have considered your position, and the particular example you wish to set to servicemen and women and others.\" Fallon's resignation comes at a politically tumultuous time for May's Cabinet members, who are due to resume Brexit negotiations in Brussels next week.

        "content": "London (CNN)UK Prime Minister Theresa May was forced to replace her Defense Secretary on Wednesday as a growing sexual harassment scandal added to the pressure on a government already struggling with the fallout from Brexit.May named a key Conservative Party fixer, Gavin Williamson, to fill the post vacated after the resignation of Michael Fallon, who admitted his behavior towards women had \"fallen short\" during his career.Fallon was the first minister to resign after a swirl of allegations swept British political circles in recent weeks.Williamson, 41, has been the government's Chief Whip since 2016, in which role he was responsible for enforcing parliamentary discipline within the party.His rapid elevation to a top Cabinet position has prompted questions in some quarters over his qualifications and whether, in effect he promoted himself, since the chief whip advises the Prime Minister on appointments. Prime Minister Theresa May faces political tumult over a sexual harassment scandal in Westminster and the torturous Brexit process.Read MoreWilliamson is known for his loyalty to May, commentators say, but does not have a military background or prior ministerial experience.Shortly after Williamson's appointment was announced, Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston tweeted: \"There are times when offered a job that it would be better to advise that another would be more experienced & suited to the role.\"May's former chief of staff, Nick Timothy, tweeted in defense of the move, saying that Williamson, who was May's campaign manager in the last election, \"has been a brilliant chief whip.\" He added: \"The idea he appointed himself is absurd. She rates him.\"Read new Defence Secretary @GavinWilliamson's statement about his appointment today. pic.twitter.com/dZs1E7U3Hp\u2014 Ministry of Defence (@DefenceHQ) November 2, 2017\n\nThe Ministry of Defence tweeted a statement from Williamson in which he said its work was vital to combat \"rising threats in a worsening international security situation.\" May announced Wednesday that UK party leaders would meet next week to discuss a new process to handle sexual abuse allegations, as she faced questions in the House of Commons over her handling of concerns raised in the past.JUST WATCHEDBrexit showdown bringing uncertainty to UKReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBrexit showdown bringing uncertainty to UK 01:48The crisis has emerged at a time when May already faces deep divisions within her government over Brexit and questions over her future as the Conservative Party leader after June's general election left her without an overall majority.In a sign of the political tumult, the House of Commons on Wednesday night passed a motion requiring the government publish secret documents detailing the economic impact of Brexit on various parts of the economy.The government has so far been resisting pressure to release the information, arguing it would undermine its Brexit negotiating position. It is due to resume talks on Britain's EU departure in Brussels, Belgium, next week.Fallon: 'Fallen below' high standardsFallon's departure came after a journalist, Julia Hartley-Brewer, confirmed he had repeatedly placed his hand on her knee at a dinner in 2002.Hartley-Brewer has said she did not regard the incident as harassment, but Fallon hinted in a statement Wednesday evening that further allegations could be forthcoming.Michael Fallon, pictured October 31, says his conduct fell short of the high standards expected.\"In recent days allegations have been made about MPs' conduct, including my own,\" he said. \"Many of these have been false, but I realize that in the past I have fallen below the high standards that we require of the armed forces, which I have the privilege to represent.\"Speaking later to the BBC, Fallon said that what had been \"acceptable 15, 10 years ago is clearly not acceptable now.\"Reacting to Fallon's resignation on Twitter, Hartley-Brewer said: \"I doubt my knee was the reason.\" No further allegations have yet been made public against Fallon.Lawmakers investigatedIn a letter accepting Fallon's resignation on Wednesday, May praised his \"diligent service.\"JUST WATCHEDUK minister investigated over sex toy claimsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHUK minister investigated over sex toy claims 00:34She said: \"I appreciate the characteristically serious manner in which you have considered your position, and the particular example you wish to set to servicemen and women and others.\"Earlier Wednesday, May ordered an investigation into her deputy, Damian Green, amid allegations of unwanted advances toward a female writer. Green has denied the harassment claims.Last week, she ordered an inquiry into international trade minister Mark Garnier, who reportedly admitted to a newspaper that he asked his personal assistant to buy sex toys and used a sexual slur against her.The Prime Minister's office has said all allegations of sexual harassment are to be taken seriously and has urged victims of assault and harassment to report it to the police.

A grizzled coach is cooing, then a middle-aged woman starts to make incomprehensible sing-song noises. Hearts are melting. This individual is extracting joyous toothy smiles from whoever enters the room. He is the four-month-old son of two-time Olympic champion Ted Ligety, accompanying dad on the road while the man the rest of the world knows as \"Ted the Shred\" goes to work on the slopes. \"He's just sitting there, smiling, doing his own thing,\" says Ligety with a smitten look on his face.

He concedes he is a different person to the one who last competed nearly a year ago, before a back injury forced him under the surgeon's knife. He is softer, more emotional, more focused.He is skiing without pain for the first time in years, too.     Family nap time. We love you so much, Jax. #6/28/17 #daddysboy A post shared by Ted Ligety (@ted_ligety) on Jun 29, 2017 at 3:27pm PDT READ: US ski great Bode Miller retires aged 40\"It's a different mindset, for sure, a different release,\" the five-time giant slalom world champion says of fatherhood. \"I feel I need to be on top of what I'm doing in training because I want to go home, so I'm definitely focusing more because of that. \"I'm not a very emotional person, but the most surprising thing for me is how having a kid softens you up, loving something so much, watching his little evolutions every day. \"The last couple of days he's been making 'oohing' and 'ahhing' noises. Every single day there's something new, which is really neat.\"The view from from outside the US team's apartment blockThe Utah native is speaking in the lobby of the apartments the US ski team has been using as its base during pre-season and the opening weeks of the FIS Ski World Cup season. The sleepy Alpine village of Zwieselstein, the sort of place where a healthy tolerance of hairpin turns is required, will be home for Ligety, his wife Mia and Jax until the team moves 96km away, to a village near Innsbruck, when the season gets into full swing. Outside, on a crisp technicolor afternoon in a part of the world known as \"The Land in the Mountains,\" all is quiet. Only nature makes a sound in a place such as this. Autumn is changing the Alpine trees into varying shades of brown and dotted among the hazel, chocolate and caramel-colored pines are wooden houses, a tiny church and a restaurant to feed the horde of skiing enthusiasts who will descend to this basin of the Otzal valley over the winter. READ: The ski resort with a James Bond museumA river trickles through the village, continuing on its descent from the awe-inspiring mountains, and on a muddy track which leads to the US team's modest-looking secluded block, a woman is pushing a pram. It is not an uncommon sight, not since the Americans set up camp here anyway. \"We've a bunch of newborns on the road,\" says Ligety. Sasha Rearick, the men's head coach, Forest Carey, head technical coach, and skiers Steve Nyman and Andrew Weibrecht have also recently become parents.

You can share the experience because others are going through the same things as well.\"But how do members of the team who aren't parents feel about the new additions to the party? \"You'll have to ask them,\" he says with a shrug.\"We're on the men's team and the boys aren't really all that curious. There's definitely not as much interest on the men's side as there is when you hang around with the women -- they want to hold them more.\"The American is today dressed in casual sportswear; a baseball cap, socks and a pair of slides sandals complete his easygoing look. He seems utterly relaxed on the eve of what was supposed to be his first World Cup competition of the season. Less than 24 hours later, however, as the Apline fog rolled in, Ligety saw red when race organizers canceled the men's giant slalom hours before the first run.@fisalpine Seems odd to have a race cancelled at 645am in Austria when their biggest star is temporarily out... \ud83e\udd14\u2014 Ted Ligety (@tedligety) October 29, 2017\n\nREAD: Five reasons to be pumped for the ski seasonConditions were deemed \"too dangerous\" for the athletes and spectators. Ligety voiced his disapproval on Twitter, hinting at a conspiracy. Baby Jax must wait a little longer, until November 26, for the super-G at Lake Louise, to watch Dad in action for the first time. READ: Surgery marks end of Ligety's medal runThe defending giant slalom Olympic champion, a winner of 25 World Cup races, has brought his family on the road because, he says, of the sadness he felt while training in New Zealand without them. He would speak to his wife daily on FaceTime, and wave and play up to his son on screen, but hearing second-hand tales of his newborn's latest gargles and babbles caused the heart to ache. \"I left and he was a little dough ball, not holding his head up, and I came back and he's sitting up, looking at me, interacting,\" he says. \"He'll be one-and-a-half next year, running around, that'll be a whole new challenge, for sure. But we'll cross that bridge when we get there. I can't imagine not having them on the road with me.\" Ligety is not the only father on the slopes. He can exchange tales of nappy changes and night-time feeds with fellow Alpine skiers Felix Neureuhter, Florian Eisath, Leif Kristian Haugen and Andre Myhrer, while there are also plenty of elite sportsmen combining fatherhood with continued sporting success. There is Roger Federer, of course, the most famous sporting dad of them all, traveling the world with his wife and four children, still winning grand slams, still breaking records. But Ligety laughs at the comparison with a man whose $64 million fortune allows for private planes, nannies and as many luxurious hotel rooms as his entourage requires. \"We have a fraction of the resources,\" he says with a shake of the head. \"It's a different world.\"Regardless of income, every new family needs routine and, for Ligety, his current schedule comprises of gym work when his son is resting and nights in the spare bedroom before early-morning sessions and race days. \"It would be hard waking up at 5.30 in the morning to ski and getting up with him. He wakes up every two to three hours a night,\" Ligety explains. \"When I have a day off we all sleep together.\"    Feeling \"strong\" one day out. #scarsarecool #builtinzipper A post shared by Ted Ligety (@ted_ligety) on Jan 19, 2017 at 2:01pm PST Fatherhood is not the only thing contributing to Ligety's cheerful demeanor. He is back on the mountains, fit again, happy again, after being forced to bring last season to a premature end because of three herniated disks in his back. Breaking bones and tearing ligaments is par for the course for those who ply their trade on the piste. With high speeds comes danger. According to the FIS, the sport's governing body, one in three racers suffer severe injury during the season. Ligety is therefore one of a number of skiers accustomed to the torture of rehab. Early last year he had reconstructive knee surgery for a torn anterior cruciate ligament and to compound a miserable 12 months, after multiple cortisone injections and consultations with doctors and physiotherapists in search for a cure to the back problem which had been causing him discomfort for more than a year, Ligety finally raised the white flag and had surgery again in January. It ended his defense of the giant slalom world title, an event in which he had reigned supreme since 2011.READ: Why 'life is dangerous' for Alpine skiersJUST WATCHEDThe dangers of being an Alpine skierReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe dangers of being an Alpine skier 03:03\"In hindsight, I should've stopped earlier and got surgery earlier,\" he concedes. \"To know you have to pull the pin was definitely tough. \"Watching the World Championships was really tough, but at least I was on the road to recovery at that point, whereas in December and early January I was just struggling to figure out the best course of action.\"Listening to Ligety describe the severe pain he was experiencing while racing last year is enough to make anyone squirm. \"You know those wire cheese cutters?\" he asks, bright eyed. \"It felt like one of those was running from my back down to my foot.\"Whenever I hit a bump, something would yank on it. It felt like a sharp, wiry burning pain every time I hit a bump. \"If I was sitting in a good position it was OK, but standing up, I couldn't do a straight leg raise.\"Ligety, whose broad shoulders make him look as wide as he is 5 feet 11 inches tall, stands up and bends his knee at about a 60-degree angle to illustrate the lack of movement he had in his left leg last season.\"I felt like I could race,\" says Ligety, whose unique style means he is almost horizontal to the hill mid-turn in the giant slalom, his hips grazing the snow. \"I still had strength in it and I could still move, but every single time I hit a bump and my leg went straight, it was shooting pain. \"Every time I was hitting a bump, I was having to brace for that pain and it was not a productive way to going fast.\"Ligety began sking aged twoLigety last won a World Cup race on October 25, 2015. Fighting aches and pains, he reveals, \"definitely weighs on you mentally.\" \"It weighs on your skiing, too,\" he continues. \"When you're going out training, you're trying to avoid the pain and then you start to ski a bit differently to avoid those issues and, two months later, you're wondering why you suck.\"Being healthy is so good because you can get correct motions. That fuels the skiing and fuels the confidence and all that sort of stuff.\"Such is Ligety's love for skiing, he has been zig-zagging on snow since he was two years old, that he never considered retiring during his injury-plagued few years. \"It's a good job so it's easy to have that motivation to come back strong,\" he says.  \"When you haven't been on the skis for three months and you know you have another three months until you can ski, it's hard to grind through it, but it's lucky for me that none of my injuries have been groundbreaking. \"There's always been a clear pathway back, it's just a matter of pushing through it.\"Fiery arrows of pain no longer tear down his leg -- he was back training two months after the microdiscectomy procedure on his back -- and after a summer of working on his technique, Ligety is now earnestly increasing his speed. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news and videosThis is the man who, from 2008 to 2014, dominated the giant slalom. In a sport where the margin of victory is often hundredths of a second, he was winning races by nearly three seconds. Can he return to that form before the Winter Olympics, which start in South Korea on February 9? \"I don't know if I am where I want to be,\" he says. \"But I'm getting close.\"",

Some of Puigdemont's ministers were seen returning to Barcelona on Wednesday, but is unclear yet whether they will show up to court. Spain was plunged into its worst political crisis in decade after Puigdemont's administration held an independence referendum on October 1. The crisis came to a head last week on Friday, when the Catalan parliament declared unilateral independence. Madrid responded by suspending the region's autonomy, sacking the government and imposing direct rule.",

The crisis came to a head last week when the Catalan Parliament declared unilateral independence.In response, Madrid sacked Puigdemont and his government, and stripped Catalonia of its cherished autonomy. Puigdemont: Charges 'punish ideas'A separate case against six other Catalan lawmakers related to the independence bid was adjourned at the Supreme Court. All six, including Parliament speaker Carme Forcadell, showed up to the session.Puigdmeont, who still considers himself Catalonia's rightful leader, denied he was evading justice, claiming that the charges had no legal basis and sought \"only to punish ideas,\" according to his spokesperson.\"We are facing a political trial,\" the spokesperson said.According to the spokesperson, the former ministers who turned up to court Thursday did so to make a complaint against the Spanish judicial system's \"lack of guarantees\" to allow the pursuit of political ideas.In a video message recorded in Belgium and released Thursday, Puigdemont condemned the detention of members of his cabinet as an attack on democracy. He calling the move a \"very, very bad mistake.\"Catalonia's independence standoff: How we got here, what comes nextHe said that \"political imprisonments without precedents are unacceptable in Europe and in the 21st century.\" \"We have to fight it the way Catalans do, like we fight the things that have made us big as a country, as a nation and as a society,\" Puigdemont said. \"Without violence, with peace and respect for all options.\"Puigdemont's Belgian lawyer, Paul Bekaert, told Reuters the former leader would cooperate with Spanish and Belgian authorities.\"The climate is not good, it is better to take some distance,\" he said.Puigdemont has denied he traveled to Brussels to seek political asylum.

Like we've talked about from the beginning, these two teams mirror one another. And the compete and fight in both teams is the most important thing I see as similarities. But, again, we worked all year long to have home-field advantage, and here we are. It's only fitting for this series, yeah.\"Justin Verlander, acquired by Houston for a deep postseason run, was dominant through the first five innings. He had a 1-0 lead thanks to a solo home run by Astros leadoff hitter George Springer in the top of the third off Dodgers starter Rich Hill. It was Springer's fourth home run in this World Series, making him the only other leadoff hitter aside from Lenny Dykstra (1993) to accomplish that feat.But the Dodgers got to Verlander, the former Detroit Tigers ace, in the bottom of the sixth with an RBI double by Chris Taylor and an RBI sacrifice fly by Corey Seager.Read MoreJoc Pederson added a solo home run off Astros reliever Joe Musgrove in the bottom of the seventh. It's Pederson's third home run of the World Series.Joc Pederson celebrates with third base coach Chris Woodward after hitting a solo home run in the seventh inning.Verlander went six innings, allowing two runs on three hits, striking out nine.Hill lasted 4 2/3 innings, giving up the one run, one intentional walk and four hits on 58 pitches. He struck out five.The Astros have never won a World Series in their completed 55 seasons. Only the Cleveland Indians (69 years) and Texas Rangers (57 years) have had longer current championship droughts than Houston. The Dodgers last won the Fall Classic in 1988.This marks the 39th time in a best-of-seven World Series that the Fall Classic has extended to a final game (including 1912, when eight games were played following a Game 2 tie). The Dodgers will attempt to become the 21st team to come back from down 3-2 in the Fall Classic under the current seven-game format.Of the 40 times that a team leading 3-2 has dropped Game 6, it has gone on to win the series 18 times, which is 45%. Ten of the last 12 teams to lose Game 6 with a 3-2 lead went on to lose the series. The last three teams with a 3-2 lead to lose Game 6 and win the series were the 2014 Giants, the 1997 Marlins and the 1975 Reds.This year's Fall Classic has been full of power -- these teams set the record for most home runs in a single World Series with 24 so far -- and dramatic comebacks. Game 5 was the craziest of all, ending with a 13-12 Astros walk-off win in the 10th inning.\"This series has been back and forth,\" Astros manager A.J. Hinch said Tuesday after Game 6. \"And two incredible teams, trying to get to the finish line. And so now, now obviously it's good for our sport. Necessarily bad for us, because we wanted to win tonight. We'll get back to the hotel, where we'll collect ourselves. Both teams will be ready to play with about as much energy as you could possibly imagine in Game 7.\"First pitch for Game 7 is scheduled for Wednesday at 8:20 p.m. ET. Yu Darvish will start for Los Angeles. In Game 3, he lasted just 1 and 2/3 innings, the shortest outing of his major league career. Lance McCullers Jr. will start for Houston.",

        "content": "London (CNN)UK Prime Minister Theresa May has ordered an investigation into her deputy, Damian Green, amid allegations of unwanted advances toward a female writer, a Downing Street spokesman told CNN on Wednesday.The writer, Kate Maltby, said she had met with Green in 2015 to discuss her professional career. Writing in The Times of London newspaper on Wednesday, Maltby said: \"He offered me career advice and in the same breath made it clear he was sexually interested. It was not acceptable to me at the time and it should not be acceptable behaviour in Westminster in the future.\"She said Green, who was a friend of the family nearly 30 years her senior, had \"steered the conversation to the habitual nature of sexual affairs in parliament,\" before mentioning that \"his own wife was very understanding.\"She added: \"I felt a fleeting hand against my knee -- so brief, it was almost deniable. I moved my legs away, and tried to end the drink on friendly terms.\"Read MoreMaltby, who also contributes to CNN, said she had dropped all contact with Green following the encounter. But in May last year, he had contacted her by text message after seeing a piece she had written for The Times on the history of corsets which included an image of her wearing one.According to Maltby, Green's text message read: \"Long time no see. But having admired you in a corset in my favourite tabloid I feel impelled to ask if you are free for a drink anytime?\"Maltby said she had ignored the message but had since had contact with Green on a professional basis.\"Awkward relationships like this are part of being a young woman in Westminster,\" she wrote. \"It shouldn't be the norm -- which is why I have chosen to speak out. But it's crucial to understand that most of us have to maintain relationships with such men in order to thrive professionally.\"The Houses of Parliament in London on October 31, 2017.Green: 'Deeply hurtful' claimGreen, who is effectively the deputy leader to May, described the allegations as \"completely untrue\" and \"deeply hurtful\" in a statement Wednesday.\"It is absolutely and completely untrue that I've ever made any sexual advances on Ms Maltby,\" Green said.\"I have known Ms Maltby since she contacted me as board member of Bright Blue, the Conservative think tank, in 2014, and we have had a drink as friends twice-yearly. The text I sent after she appeared in a newspaper article was sent in that spirit -- as two friends agreeing to meet for a regular catch up - and nothing more.\"This untrue allegation has come as a complete shock and is deeply hurtful, especially from someone I considered a personal friend.\"Green, a Conservative who represents the Ashford constituency in Kent, southeast England, was first elected to Parliament in 1997. He was appointed First Secretary of State in June this year.In a statement, May's spokesman said: \"An allegation has been made in relation to the FSS, which he strongly denies. The Prime Minister has referred the matter to the Cabinet Secretary to establish the facts and report back as soon as possible.\"Prime Minister Theresa May's office has urged UK parliamentary staff to come forward with any sexual harassment allegations.Speaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday, May said she had written to all political leaders about meeting next week to discuss a \"common, transparent, independent grievance procedure\" to deal with sexual harassment allegations within the UK parliament.During Prime Minister's Questions, Labour MP Lisa Nandy said she had raised concerns with May three years ago about party whips  -- those lawmakers responsible for enforcing discipline within their respective parties -- using \"information about sexual abuse to demand loyalty from MPs.\"Nandy called for concrete action to address the issue, saying May had failed to act since she had raised it previously.Responding to the question, May said the party whips should make it clear to people that any allegations of sexual abuse which could be criminal in nature should be reported to the police.May also told Parliament that action would be taken where allegations of misconduct are proven to be true.May's office last week urged staff in the UK parliament to come forward with any allegations of sexual harassment after reports that aides were privately sharing stories alleging inappropriate conduct by lawmakers.Labour Party deals with separate claimSeparately, the UK Labour Party said it had launched an independent investigation into allegations that a young party activist was raped by a senior official in 2011.The activist, Bex Bailey, said it had taken her a while to \"summon up the courage\" to tell others in the party what had happened. But in an interview with the BBC, Bailey said: \"It was suggested to me (by those within the party) that I not report it. I was told that if I did, it might damage me.\"Bex Bailey is pictured at an event in London in 2009.Bailey said she had not reported the incident to the police at the time. \"I was scared, I felt ashamed, I know that the Labour Party, like any family, loves a good gossip - and I didn't want people to know and I also was worried that I wouldn't be believed if I did,\" she said.The alleged perpetrator was not an elected official, she said. It's unclear whether Bailey has since reported the alleged sexual assault to police.In a statement, a Labour Party spokesman said the organization took the allegations \"extremely seriously\" and had asked an independent legal adviser to investigate them. The party has declined to say whether the alleged perpetrator is still a member or official of the party.\"It takes great courage for victims of rape to come forward - and all support must and will be made available to them. We would strongly recommend that the police investigate the allegations of criminal actions that Bex Bailey has made,\" the spokesman said.Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Facebook there was \"no tolerance\" in the party for such behavior, adding that the organization was \"absolutely committed to rooting it out.\"He added: \"Speaking out about rape and sexual harassment takes enormous courage. Bex Bailey has shown incredible bravery by talking publicly about what has happened to her and has my full support and solidarity.\"The claims come in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal and the #MeToo campaign, where victims of sexual abuse have been sharing their experiences.",

He continued to insist his ousted administration was the \"legitimate Catalan government.\"Puigdemont told reporters in Brussels that his party would participate in elections in Catalonia on December 21, called by the Spanish government after it dissolved his administration in Barcelona last week.Deposed Catalan President Carles Puigdemont in Brussels on Tuesday. \"I am not here to demand political asylum. I am here in Brussels as the capital of Europe,\" he told reporters at the Belgian press club, alongside other members of his deposed government. \"I'm here in order to act with freedom and safety.\"Despite the defiant rhetoric, it was clear that Puigdemont and his allies are on the back foot in the month-long standoff with Madrid, which began when Catalonia pressed ahead with a disputed independence referendum on October 1 and came to a head when the Catalan parliament voted for a unilateral declaration independence last Friday.Read MoreThe Spanish High Court has accepted a complaint against Puigdemont, who is expected to return to Madrid by Thursday when he and other members of his cabinet will face court.Bail was set at more than $7.2 million (6.2 million euros), which the accused will have three days to deposit.Thousands of civil servants have returned to work in Barcelona under the authority of the Spanish government, after it imposed direct rule in the wake the independence declaration. The leadership of the secession movement is fractured, with key figures out of the country.Puigdemont appeared to concede the political reality, warning his supporters of an uphill battle ahead. \"To the people of Catalonia, I ask them to be ready for a very long path. We are facing a state that only understands the reason of force,\" he said.     Court dates setOn Monday, as Puigdemont arrived in Brussels, Spain's chief prosecutor Jose Manuel Maza announced he would seek charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds against the ousted leader and several members of his former government. The charge of rebellion carries a maximum jail term of 30 years.The speaker of the Catalan parliament, Carme Forcadell, will be among the first to face court. Judicial authorities summoned her and other MPs to the Supreme Court for Thursday, or face fines.Catalonia's independence standoff: How we got here, what comes nextPuidgemont said his party would take part in the December elections.\"We take the election called for by the Spanish state as a democratic challenge -- we are not afraid of them,\" he said.Puigdemont called on Madrid to give guarantees it will respect the results, even if pro-independence parties  win, and to refrain from violence. Madrid sent thousands of national police into Catalonia on October 1 to shut down the referendum, which it regarded as illegal. Images of officers firing rubber bullets at protestors, dragging people by the hair from polling stations and restraining elderly voters grabbed attention around the world.  A Catalan crisisThe independence bid has plunged Spain into it worst political crisis since the restoration of democracy in the 1970s. Some 90% voted in favor of independence in the disputed referendum, but turnout was only 43%.It has also been deeply divisive. Hundreds of thousands of people have protested in Barcelona both for and against independence.Catalan President Carles Puigdemont, center, takes part in an independence march in Barcelona on October 21.A recent poll that surveyed 1,000 people showed that political parties backing independence would not win a majority if elections were held today. Pro-independence parties would get 61 to 65 seats in the region's parliament, short of a majority in the 135-seat assembly, the Sigma Dos poll suggests. Pro-independence parties had 72 seats in the parliament before it was dissolved.",

In a recorded address made from self-imposed exile in Brussels, Belgium, Puigdemont appealed to Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to accept the election results.\"The ballot boxes have spoken, democracy has spoken, everyone has been able to express themselves. What is Rajoy waiting for in order to accept the results?\" Puigdemont said in a speech posted Saturday on social media.It's unlikely Rajoy will be receptive to the appeal. He has refused to meet with Puigdemont, who went to Brussels after Spanish authorities announced they were seeking his arrest. Rajoy says he will meet only with leaders of the pro-unity Ciutadans (Citizens) party. Read MoreSpain's Rajoy rejects ex-Catalan leader's call to meetThe Spanish government called the early regional election for Catalonia in the hope of quelling the separatist movement, whose push for independence this year triggered the crisis.That ambition, however, was thwarted when voters backed the three pro-independence parties. Ciutadans, known in the rest of Spain as Ciudadanos, came in first in the December 21 election. However, its 37 seats are not enough for it to form a majority government.In his video message, Puigdemont stands in front of the Catalan and European Union flags.\"The Spanish government has a new opportunity to behave as the European democracy it claims to be and therefore recognize the results of the elections that took place on December 21,\" he said in Catalan, \"and in this way to start a political negotiation with the legitimate government of Catalonia.\"Puigdemont called the 82% voter participation rate a \"historic\" success and accused Rajoy of using \"repression\" and \"intervention\" as a way to deal with the separatist movement.Millennials in the region appear to back independence. An opinion poll by the Center for Opinion Studies in Catalonia found that more than half of Catalans between the ages of 18 and 34 would vote to break away from Spain given a simple choice of yes or no.The millennials voting for Catalan independenceFriday, Rajoy told reporters that he will call on Catalonia's new Parliament to hold its inaugural session on January 17.Rajoy called for \"constructive dialogue, open and realistic, always within the law.\" Analysis: No mood for compromise after close voteThe Prime Minister said: \"I hope that Catalonia will be open, from now on, to a phase of open dialogue, not confrontation, of cooperation, not imposition, and plurality, not unilaterally.\"  Rajoy last week said the results showed a decline in support for pro-independence parties since 2010, although \"not as much as we wanted.\" The leader remains under pressure after the vote made it clear that there is no easy way out of Spain's worst political crisis in decades.Former Catalan President Carles Puigdemont welcomes the election results in a speech from Brussels, Belgium.For his part, Puigdemont was pushed from power after his government held an illegal independence referendum October 1 and lawmakers unilaterally declared the region's independence from Spain.Following Catalan lawmakers' declaration of independence, Madrid dismissed the entire Catalan government and Parliament and seized control of the region.CNN's Angela Dewan and Laura Smith-Spark, and CNN en Espa\u00f1ol's Iban De Miguel and Pau Mosquera, contributed to this report.",

In an interview with the Guardian, Bishop of Liverpool Paul Bayes accused \"self-styled\" evangelists of \"colluding\" with an administration in the White House that, he claimed, fomented division and intolerance.Bishop of Liverpool Paul Bayes\"Some of the things that have been said by religious leaders seem to collude with a system that marginalizes the poor, a system which builds walls instead of bridges, a system which says people on the margins of society should be excluded, a system which says we're not welcoming people any more into our country,\" he said.Bishop Bayes encouraged those leaders to reflect on their faith, adding that the acceptance and endorsement of right-wing populism was irreconcilable with Christian values. \"Whenever people say those kinds of things, they need to be able to justify that they're saying those things as Christians, and I do not believe it's justifiable,\" he said.Read MoreBayes noted that not all evangelical Christians were Trump supporters, saying that there were \"many, many Christians who are trying to proclaim the gospel as we've received it, even if that means political leaders have to be challenged,\" he said.Trump retweets anti-Muslim videosThe bishop's comments coincide with the launch of the Ozanne Foundation, a UK charity he supports that focuses its work \"to eliminate discrimination based on sexuality or gender, in order to embrace and celebrate the equality and diversity of all,\" according  to director Jayne Ozanne, a gay Christian evangelical leader and LGBTI activist.Catholic journal criticizes Trump 'value voters'It's not the first time senior leaders of the Church of England have been critical of the US president and his allies. During his Christmas sermon, the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby criticized \"populist leaders,\" although he did not name Trump specifically. In November, the Archbishop said it was \"deeply disturbing that the President of the United States has chosen to amplify the voice of far-right extremists\" and called on him to \"make clear his opposition to racism and hatred in all forms\" after Trump retweeted three non-verified anti-Muslim propaganda videos from the British far-right group Britain First.A spokesman for Bishop Bayes said he would not give any further comments beyond his Guardian interview.",

Markle, an American actor, has been critical of Trump in the past, and there is already widespread controversy in the UK over the prospect of an official visit by the President to the UK.Then-US President Barack Obama meets with Prince Harry at the White House in October 2015.The wedding is not a full state occasion and the guest list is being drawn up by Buckingham Palace, with the British government in a consultative role. It is not clear whether Downing Street would insist on Trump or a representative being invited, or whether it could block an invitation being extended to the Obamas.Read MoreThe vexed issue came up when Harry appeared as guest editor on BBC Radio 4's flagship morning program, Today, on Wednesday. After a pre-taped exchange between Harry and Obama, the Prince was asked whether his friendship with the former President warranted an invitation to the wedding.\"We haven't put the invites or the guest list together yet so who knows whether he's going to be invited or not. I wouldn't want to ruin that surprise,\" the prince said.Harry has become close to the Obamas through their support for the Invictus Games, an event for injured servicemen and women that was started by the UK royal in 2014. The Prince conducted the interview with Obama for BBC Radio 4's Today program while he and the former US President were in Toronto, Canada, for this year's Games. The Prince and Markle, who announced their engagement last month, have set May 19 as their wedding date. The ceremony is to be held in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, west of London.

He and his wife, Catherine, had two receptions in Buckingham Palace: a traditional lunch for over 600 guests, which was hosted by the Queen and included dignitaries and officials, and a more intimate evening party for roughly 300 friends and family.Meghan Markle intends to become UK citizen after marriage to Prince HarrySt George's Chapel was most recently the scene of the wedding of Peter Phillips -- son of Princess Anne and cousin to Harry -- who married Canada-born Autumn Kelly there in 2008.Harry and Markle spent Christmas with Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip, as well as other family members, at Sandringham, the Queen's country estate in rural Norfolk, about 100 miles north of London.Asked on air Wednesday how his first Christmas was with Markle, Harry said they had had an \"amazing time\" and a lot of fun with William and his family. \"Oh it was fantastic, she really enjoyed it.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko met with relatives of the hostages on Tuesday night, according to a statement from his office. \"Nothing is more important than to return our people home,\" he said.Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions have been mired in conflict since separatists declared their independence from Kiev in spring 2014, shortly after Russia's controversial annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region.Read MoreJUST WATCHEDUkraine: US must be clear in message to RussiaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHUkraine: US must be clear in message to Russia 08:21The Minsk agreements, which have never been fully implemented, were brokered in early 2015 by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande in talks between Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany.  The peace protocol called for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of heavy weapons from eastern Ukraine, as well as the release and exchange of all hostages and illegally held prisoners, dialogue on new local elections and the securing of Ukraine's eastern border with Russia.Martin Sajdik, of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, welcomed the exchange, saying it had long been awaited by the prisoners and their families.\"This is a deeply humanitarian gesture, even more so on the occasion of Christmas and New Year,\" he said in a statement on Tuesday, before the exchange began. \"I call upon the sides to provide conditions of dignity and respect for each of the persons to be exchanged.\"OSCE observers have been monitoring the situation in Ukraine since 2014. The organization on Friday hailed what it said was a renewed commitment to the ceasefire plan, which followed a recent increase in clashes between Ukrainian soldiers and Russian-backed separatists.\"If underpinned by withdrawal of weapons and disengagement and made in good faith, this recommitment to the ceasefire holds the promise of a more peaceful new year for the people of eastern Ukraine,\" said Ertugrul Apakan, who heads the OSCE monitoring mission in Ukraine.On Saturday, the US State Department said it would provide lethal anti-tank weapons to Ukraine to help its forces fight Russian-backed separatists. The Trump administration had already announced it would permit sales of some small arms to Ukraine from US manufacturers.Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said the US decision to supply Ukraine with anti-tank weapons meant the United States \"is clearly pushing [Ukraine] to new bloodshed.\"",

There aren't one, two or three multiple grand slam champions making a return in 2018 but a handful. Fresh injury problems for Djokovic but can he dominate once again? An elbow problem cut short Novak Djokovic's 2017 campaign in July and on December 29 the former world No.1 withdrew from the Mubadala World Tennis Championship, citing he had \"started to feel pain\" in his right elbow.Follow @cnnsport\n\nDjokovic received medical attention on court during his fourth-round match against Adrian Mannarino at Wimbledon \"After several tests, my medical team has advised me not to risk anything, to withdraw from the tournament and to immediately continue with the therapies,\" the Serb said on his official website.Read More\"I am very sad because I was eager to return to playing official matches ...\"Now I need to accept this situation, and to wait for the results of the therapies, in order to start playing tennis again and getting back to full rhythm.

JUST WATCHEDFederer: 'Dream scenario' to win 8th WimbledonReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFederer: 'Dream scenario' to win 8th Wimbledon 02:41Indeed despite Federer and Nadal owning more grand slam titles than Djokovic's 12, the Serb achieved something the pair hasn't: Winning four consecutive grand slams -- from 2015-2016. He was the first man to claim four straight since Rod Laver in 1969. When he triumphed at the French Open in June 2016 to complete the job, there were those who -- rightfully -- thought Djokovic would catch or even surpass Federer for the all-time men's lead in majors. That now looks unlikely. Djokovic hit a roadblock, a barrier that not even new coach and tennis legend Andre Agassi could remove in 2017. Why the slump? Djokovic has referred to \"private issues,\" his former coach Boris Becker said he wasn't practicing hard enough and then there were elbow and arm injuries. But he will have a new entourage in tow when he does return to the court. Flamboyant Czech Radek Stepanek -- who retired from the game this season -- will coach Djokovic alongside Agassi.

The American won the Australian Open in January while pregnant, gave birth to her first child about four months ago -- daughter Alexis Olympia -- and got married to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian in New Orleans last month. JUST WATCHEDSerena Williams shows off new baby girlReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSerena Williams shows off new baby girl 00:57Williams' coach Patrick Mouratoglou told CNN in November that a decision hadn't been made yet as to whether she would compete at next month's Australian Open although Melbourne tournament director Craig Tiley has twice said he expects the 36-year-old to show up at the season's first major. And that could very well be the case after it was announced that Williams would be making her comeback at a lucrative exhibition in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 30 against French Open winner Jelena Ostapenko. \"I am delighted to be returning to the court in Abu Dhabi for the first time since the birth of my daughter in September,\" Williams told the exhibition's web site. Despite not playing since January, no one would rule out the now 22nd-ranked Williams winning in Australia if she is in the draw. Williams, after all, could be the greatest tennis player of all time. Collecting a 24th grand slam title would see Williams tie controversial Australian Margaret Court for the all-time grand slam lead, women or men.Andy Murray to resurface too Born a week earlier than Djokovic in May 1987, Andy Murray matched his longtime friend by becoming the world No. 1 -- replacing the Serb -- late last year. But getting there took its toll: A grueling schedule surely led to the Scot's longstanding hip injury getting worse.Although Murray managed to make a grand slam semifinal at the French Open, he visibly struggled with his movement in a defeat to Sam Querrey in the Wimbledon quarterfinals. READ: Murray, Djokovic exit WimbledonLike Djokovic he shut down his season following the fabled grass-court grand slam before playing in a November exhibition in Glasgow against Federer. Whereas Djokovic is set to return to the ATP circuit the first week of January in Doha, Murray is scheduled to join Nadal at the Brisbane International in the same week.  Their performances at the Australian Open foreshadowed the tough times -- six-time winner Djokovic was upset by wildcard Denis Istomin in the second round while Mischa Zverev stunned five-time runner-up Murray in the fourth round -- so the pair will no doubt be hoping for a better start in 2018. But first, they'd take a clean bill of health. So would Nadal. The Spaniard pulled out of the exhibition in Abu Dhabi with knee problems after experiencing knee pain at the end of the 2017 season. He -- along with his fans -- will hope it's a relatively minor issue for the player who has dealt with knee injuries throughout his stellar career. Azarenka ready to resume soon?This year was supposed to be Victoria Azarenka's big comeback. And while Azarenka did return to the tour in June about six months after giving birth to son Leo, the Belorussian was another player who -- as it turned out -- called time on her season after Wimbledon. It wasn't however because of injury. The twice Australian Open winner became embroiled in a custody battle with Leo's father, Billy McKeague, and said she couldn't travel outside California with her son -- the 28-year-old lives in the US state -- while the case was ongoing.

During the layoff, Azarenka's coach Michael Joyce -- formerly in the camp of Maria Sharapova -- then switched to Britain's Johanna Konta. Azarenka received a wildcard for the ASB Classic in Auckland the first week of January and suggested she would be in the field but ended up withdrawing. \"We are obviously very disappointed to not have someone of the caliber of Victoria in Auckland and know how desperately she wanted to be playing here,\" tournament director Karl Budge was quoted as saying by the New Zealand Herald.\"However, I think we can all appreciate family comes first ...\" Azarenka was also the beneficiary of a wildcard to the Australian Open but skipping Auckland may put her participation in doubt.

It also led to Russian athletes being stripped of 11 medals from the 2014 Sochi Games, dropping Russia from first in that competition's medal table to fourth.      McLaren's World Anti-Doping Agency-commissioned reports alleged that Russia's doping scheme and coverup benefited more than 1,000 summer and winter athletes. The findings were based on the testimony of whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov, the former head of the Moscow anti-doping laboratory. Rodchenkov, who fled Russia in 2015 and is currently enrolled in an American witness protection program, claimed to have masterminded the doping and evasion infrastructure that peaked at the Sochi games.\"Dr. Rodchenkov provided credible and irrefutable evidence of the Russian state-sponsored doping system, which was ultimately supervised and financed by then-Minister of Sports Vitaly Mutko and other high-level government officials,\"  the whistleblower's lawyer, Jim Walden, said at the time.

The bus entered the pedestrian passage near the Slavyansky Boulevard subway station at around 3:50 p.m. local time (7:50 a.m. ET), where it hit a number of commuters, according to Russian state news agency TASS.Footage posted on Russian state media shows what appears to be the bus careening down stairs leading to the passage, hitting several people before coming to a halt. Police took the driver into custody but said that authorities are not treating the incident as a deliberate attack, according to state media. Investigators are considering two possibilities -- that the driver lost control of the bus or that the bus malfunctioned, state media reported. \"The driver was detained and the authorities instituted a criminal case citing the services falling short of security requirements and encroachments on the safety regulations for public transport,\" the TASS report said.Read MoreThe Russian Investigative Committee, quoted in Russian state news outlet Sputnik, said that the driver had reported that \"the bus, while being at the bus stop, suddenly began to move on its own. At the same time, despite (the driver's) attempts to stop the bus, the braking system malfunctioned and the bus continued to move.\"The Sputnik report gives a higher death and injury toll -- five deaths and 15 injuries.There was \"a high degree of probability\" that the driver did not engage the bus' brake systems, a statement from the manufacturer said. \"A preliminary analysis of the details of the incident shows that at the beginning of the movement the wheels of the bus were sharply turned to the right and the bus was moving with a significant deviation from the route,\" a statement from GAZ Group reads. \"At the same time, it can be assumed that with a high degree of probability the driver did not use any of the listed brake systems of the bus, let alone engine braking, otherwise it is guaranteed that the bus would stop.\"",

        "content": "Story highlightsThe Elizabeth Line will open in December 2018.Brexit uncertainty has resulted in a 2% drop in house prices.House prices near Crossrail stations grew by 39% in three years. (CNN)December 2017 marks one year before Elizabeth Line trains start to whisk commuters under London's streets. But the line is already having an impact on the London property market -- triggering a spike in house prices near the stations, slashing commute times and opening new residential areas for commuters. Royal PurpleThe $20 billion Elizabeth Line -- called Crossrail while it's still under construction -- will be named in honor of the UK's Queen Elizabeth II. It will add a rather regal shade of purple to the red, yellow, green and blue-colored lines on London's famous Tube map, and a much-needed 10% expansion to central London's transport capacity.The Elizabeth Line was named in honor of the UK's Queen Elizabeth II.The Elizabeth Line will open in stages over the course of a year, with the entire line due to be operational by December 2019. Trains will run from Reading, west of London, and Heathrow Airport, before descending underground into tunnels, with stops at well-known London locations including Paddington Station, Bond Street and Liverpool Street Station. From central London, the trains will continue eastwards, passing through Canary Wharf, with its cluster of skyscrapers, and heading out to stations deep in the county of Essex -- a total journey of over 60 miles. Read MoreThe line will contain 41 stations, ten of which will be brand new. And it will cut some journey times significantly: A trip from Paddington to Liverpool Street will fall from 23 minutes to 10 minutes. The Crossrail \"Bump\"Although it's not yet open, the Elizabeth Line has already led to significant \"Crossrail effects\" on London property. In 2012, a study commissioned by Crossrail stated that by 2021 residential real estate prices around new stations were predicted to rise 25% more than the average price rise in central London, and 20% higher than rises in the suburbs. An aerial view of the new Woolwich Station.A report by Lloyds Bank supports this bold claim. Reporting that the average house price close to new Crossrail stations grew by 39% over the past three years, compared to a 23% increase in surrounding areas.READ: The former London toilet on sale for $1.4 millionThe upcoming Crossrail stations have also transformed the reputations of some London areas that were historically seen as unfashionable. West Ealing, Woolwich and Whitechapel have seen prices doubling since 2007, according to online property portal eMoov. It's stating access to new Elizabeth line stations as the main reason for the above-average growth.\"With a year to go before the Elizabeth line becomes operational, homes close to Crossrail stations are already reaping the benefits with average house prices outgrowing the surrounding areas,\" said Andrew Mason, Lloyds Bank mortgage products director.Quiz: Take our 2017 architecture quizCommuters rejoiceTransport for London (which will operate the Elizabeth Line) also stresses the reach of the new line. It claims that the extension of faster rail services will result in 1.5 million more people living within 45 minutes of central London. The line is expected to be completely operational in December 2019.Houses located near train stations in central London are very expensive. Many first-time buyers have opted to purchase lower-priced properties in counties to the far east and west of the Elizabeth Line to secure access to stations. Reading and Swindon west of the capital and Colchester and Gravesend in the east are being touted as benefiting from a shorter commute.The Brexit blipHowever, for buyers, investors and speculators, property in London might not be the attractive proposition it once seemed. Uncertainty surrounding Brexit, coupled with a change in tax laws and a hike in the interest rate, has led to a marked slowdown in transactions.In September, mortgage lender The Nationwide reported that London house prices fell for the first time in eight years.READ: Is London's tall tower addiction ruining its skyline?While house prices around Crossrail stations have risen 80% (3% more than the average London increase) in the past decade, Brexit has resulted in a 2% drop since May, according to eMoov.Investors now must judge whether the \"Crossrail effect\" is a big enough lure to weather the current storm. Estate agents, of course, say it's never too late to jump on the Elizabeth Line to higher property values.",
