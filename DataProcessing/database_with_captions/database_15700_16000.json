Then the line went dead.\"It was so terrifying to get that call,\" Aegir recalls, \"They were running out, and I lost the connection with them.\" Isaac and his 14-year-old cousin Kara had spent the night watching their idol, Ariana Grande, on stage. The family had come all the way from Iceland for the concert, and had spent months planning their trip.Read MoreCousins Kara and Isaac, in front, traveled from Iceland, with Isaac's mom Aslaug, far right, and his older brother Axel, father Aegir and baby sister Anita Katrin (behind.) But an evening that had been filled with music and fun had ended in fear and bloodshed: at least 22 of Grande's fans -- one just eight years old -- dead, and 59 more wounded.\"I thought I was going to die,\" says Isaac. \"I was so scared.\"Kara says: \"My parents are in Iceland, so my first thought was that I would never see them again.\"\"We didn't know if there would be another explosion,\" Isaac explains. \"Or if there would be people with guns,\" adds Kara.Flowers and messages of support are left in Manchester's St Ann's Square in tribute to the 22 people who died in an attack at an Ariana Grande concert on Monday night.Horrified at the thought of what he might find when he reached the arena, Aegir jumped into a cab and kept calling.\"They said there was blood everywhere. That's when we knew it was serious,\" Aegir said.The family counts themselves lucky that Isaac and Kara emerged safe -- albeit traumatized -- from the arena, when so many did not.\"I can't believe it,\" says Isaac's mom Aslaug. \"I'm almost getting more shocked as time goes on and you hear the stories of parents searching for their children -- that could have been us.\"And it is this, that the bomber appears to have deliberately targeted a concert with a predominantly young audience, which has horrified so many here.Hannah Bougherira (far left) said she was shocked that a terrorist had plotted to attack a concert packed with young girls: \"To think he's planned butchering these kids is disgusting.\"Hiding her tears behind large sunglasses, Jean Taylor, from Manchester, says she is \"devastated, heartbroken,\" at the thought of \"all those young people just going out, having a nice time.\"\"It's just awful, because ... you're going out to see somebody that you follow, you love the music, everybody is excited for that night, and they'll never be coming back home,\" Taylor says.READ MORE: Teen girl's rite of passage ends in horrorDefiance in the face of terrorLarge sections of Manchester city center were off limits Tuesday, as police and investigators searched for clues to the deadly attack.But beyond the cordon, there was plenty of evidence that Mancunians had taken to heart Mayor Andy Burnham's pledge that: \"Today it will be business as usual, as far as possible, in our great city.\"By Tuesday afternoon, many had returned to Manchester's shopping district while billboards shared messages of defiance.Indeed, just over 12 hours after the blast hit, the streets were busy with office workers and visitors. People sat at pavement cafes, sharing a bottle of wine with friends, stopped at the hairdressers for a blow dry, or shopped for clothes.In Albert Square, the city's main public space,  workers on their lunchbreak sat in the sun eating sandwiches as TV satellite trucks gathered around them and the memorial to Queen Victoria's husband.Inside the Victorian Gothic town hall, its corridors lined with statues of the great and the good of Manchester's past, books of condolence had been set up for people to share their thoughts and sympathies.Many Mancunians went to sign books of condolence for those killed in the attack. \"You may see the general public going about their daily lives,\" one contributor had written. \"It is not that we don't care ... we do! We are continuing because they cannot win! They want to take away our freedom and we shall not let them.\"Even Isaac and Kara and their family were out in the sunshine, exploring the city, determined not to let the events of last night completely color their view of Manchester.\"We're going home tomorrow, but I wanted to walk down here with them,\" said Aslaug. \"It's part of the process of healing, to get out, not to close ourselves in a hotel room. \"I wanted them to feel the compassion -- there's compassion everywhere,\" she said, as locals laid flowers behind her, in St Ann's Square.READ MORE: Homeless hero helps concert attack victimsSmall acts of kindness\"It's crazy,\" says taxi driver Robel Tewolde, originally from Eritrea. \"Yesterday, we were talking about football, who's going to win. Today it's a different story.\"Manchester is a city known for its friendliness, the sort of kindness that will surround a family visiting from Iceland in a time of adversity and make them honorary Mancunians, even if just for a while. That empathy was widespread over Monday night and into Tuesday. Soon after the news of the arena attack broke, stories were emerging of small acts of kindness in the face of terrorism: Members of the public offering first aid, drivers providing free rides, local residents giving stranded concert goers a place to stay, restaurants handing out free food to emergency services workers.Cafe workers like Sid wanted to play their part by delivering food and drinks to those working in the aftermath of the attacks. Tewolde had taken excited Ariana Grande fans to the show on Monday evening, \"then in a few hours, everything changed.\" He was working nearby when the blast rocked the arena.Robel Tewolde, a taxi driver, told CNN: \"I was outside the arena, I didn't know what had happened but then I saw a flood of people.\"\"I didn't know what had happened, but then I saw a flood of people. I tried to help them, direct them to a safe place -- a petrol station where they could meet up with their families.\"Artist Rachel Harrington struggled to find something she could do to help.\"I don't have a car, I don't have a bed to offer anybody. I was going to give blood, but they say they don't need any more, but I can do this,\" she says, gesturing at her latest artwork: the words of Mayor Burnham, \"We are grieving today, but we are strong,\" chalked onto the pavement of Albert Square, in the shadow of the town hall.Rachel Harrington draws in Albert Square to show her support for people caught up in the terror.Harrington says she hopes the impromptu artwork will show the victims, survivors and families that \"we're all there for them, we're all together and we're going to get through this.\"A minister, Daniel Valentine, was part of a team supporting visitors to St Ann's Church in the city center, which offered people a \"space to comprehend what's happened.\" He said as soon as the church opened on Tuesday morning, people stopped by to offer drinks and refreshments.\"Even in the depths of the most horrible, horrible assault, the people of Manchester are showing how wonderful humanity can be,\" Valentine added.READ MORE: Ariana Grande superfan among the deadMancunian prideManchester is a proud city: Proud of its industrial heritage, its soccer prowess (many signs are using the names of its rival teams City and United to make a point), its music scene, and proud too, that it has weathered tough times -- surviving previous terror attacks -- and has bounced back, bigger and bolder than before.Poet Tony Walsh speaks at a vigil, to honor the victims of Monday evening's terror attack on a concert in Manchester.Tony \"Longfella\" Walsh voiced this pride and defiance -- to massive cheers, and a fair few sobs -- at the vigil in Albert Square on Tuesday evening, with his poem \"This is the place.\"He reminded Mancunians of their history -- and their destiny: \"To survive and to thrive. And to work and to build. And to connect and create. They'll never defeat the dreamers and schemers who teem through these streets.\"Vigil attendee John Hill made this sign which reads \"Peace + Love Manchester\" in support of the victims of Monday's terror attack.\"There's hard times again in these streets of our city. But we won't take defeat, and we don't want your pity,\" Walsh insisted. \"Because this is the place where we stand strong together.\"Because this is the place, in our hearts and our homes. Because this is the place. It's a part of our bones.\"Manchester is also known for its diversity, with large Muslim and Jewish communities, and a sizeable LGBT population.The crowd at the vigil reflected this, with Mancunians of all ages, faiths and genders present.Charanjit Singh Heera, from Manchester's Sikh community, said the bomber would not succeed in dividing the city.READ MORE: UK threat level raised to criticalCouncillor Eddie Newton, Lord Mayor of Manchester, told those who gathered in the square that the people of Manchester would \"defy the terrorists, by all our diverse communities working together.\"His words were echoed by many of those listening in the square. \"We are together,\" said Charanjit Singh Heera, from Manchester's Sikh community. \"We cannot be broken with this type of barbaric, heinous act. Whoever did this should be ashamed, but they will not break up the city.\"\"They are few,\" the Bishop of Manchester, David Walker, told the crowd of thousands. \"We are many. We are Manchester.\"",

        "content": "Story highlightsOfficials: Salman Abedi went to Libya for three weeks, returning only days before the attackFamily friend says Abedi and brother were getting in trouble in EnglandManchester, England (CNN)Salman Abedi, the man who carried out the deadliest terror attack to hit the UK in 12 years, grew up in Manchester with parents who had fled Libya under Moammar Gadhafi. Abedi's father returned to the African nation in 2011 after the rebels overthrew the government and his wife  joined him earlier this year.  After getting word that Salman Abedi and his brother Hashim were getting into trouble in England, Ramadan Abedi sent for his boys and they joined their parents about a month ago, a family friend in Libya told CNN. But Salman Abedi came back to England last week after telling his father he wanted to make a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia, the source -- who asked not to be named for discussing sensitive family matters -- and a source in the Libyan community of Manchester, told CNN.Three days after he returned, Salman Abedi went to an Ariana Grande concert where authorities said he detonated a bomb that killed 22 fans -- many of them children and young people -- who were leaving the Manchester Arena. Scores more people were hurt, some critically. Read MoreAbedi, 22, is believed to have died in the powerful blast, but a coroner has yet to officially identify his remains, Manchester police said.On the radarAbedi was already known to authorities, UK Home Secretary Amber Rudd said Wednesday. But it's not yet clear why he was on their radar.Rudd said authorities were aware of him, to a point. \"The intelligence services know a lot of people, and I'm sure we will find out more what level they knew about him in due course,\" she told the BBC.\"But at the moment all they have confirmed is that they did know about him, and as I say we will find out more when the operation is complete.\"Salman Abedi in a Facebook image from a few years ago.Authorities now are working to track down Salman Abedi's associates.\"It is very clear that this is a network we are investigating,\" Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said Wednesday.Rudd had earlier told the BBC that the bomber may not have worked alone.

ISIS claimed responsibility, saying Abedi was a \"soldier of the caliphate,\" but offered no evidence. French Interior Minister G\u00e9rard Collomb told BFM-TV that Abedi had \"proven links to ISIS,\" though he did not elaborate. Rudd declined to comment on the claim.Time in LibyaThe Abedi family friend told CNN the two brothers wanted revenge for a friend who was killed by a gang.Their father, a police officer in Libya, got them to go there and took away their passports. Salman Abedi got his travel documents back by saying he wanted to make an Umrah, or pilgrimage, to Mecca, the friend told CNN.US military officials assigned to Africa Command told CNN that Salman Abedi had been in Libya for three weeks. That specific information has been shared between US and British intelligence services, the US officials said, adding they currently have \"high confidence\" the information is accurate.The trip raises questions about what he was doing there, whom he met with and whether he received training or support. Abedi was a student at the University of Salford -- Manchester's third largest university -- where he studied business and management in the 2015-2016 academic year. He was enrolled for a second year, but hadn't been attending classes, nor had he been active in school life, according to those who knew him. Abedi did not stay on campus in Salford, instead living in the Fallowfield area of south Manchester.Suspected bomber was lonely childDetails are slowly emerging about Abedi, who was born and raised in the United Kingdom, according to Prime Minister Theresa May.Abedi had seemed like a lonely child, who kept himself to himself, according to long-time family friend Akram Ben Ramadan, a British Libyan who had known Abedi and his brother, Ismael, since the Abedis were children. There were four children in the family in total -- three boys and one girl.Full coverageWho is attacker?Girl, 8, among victimsCity defiant after attackMom's worst fears confirmedAriana Grande suspends tourHomeless hero helps victimsAnalysis: More attacks expected?Abedi went to a Manchester school, Burnage Academy for Boys, from 2009 to 2011. The school declined to comment on his time there but sent a message of support to all those affected by the attack.Ramadan, who had not seen Abedi much in recent years, said he had noticed that he had begun to dress \"Islamically,\" in a long robe, and was growing a beard.The Manchester Islamic Centre and Didsbury Mosque, a couple of miles from Abedi's home, condemned the \"horrific\" bombing in a statement on its website Wednesday.And Fawzi Haffar, a trustee of the center, told reporters gathered outside the large, red brick mosque -- which welcomes thousands of Muslims every week -- that a small number of media reports that claimed the bomber had worked at the site were \"not true.\"Monday's attack \"shocked us all,\" he said. \"This act of cowardice has no place in our religion or any other religion for that matter. We encourage anyone, and I repeat anyone, who may have information about the individual involved to contact the police without any delay.\"CNN's Lauren Said-Moorhouse and Atika reported from Manchester, while Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London and Steve Almasy wrote from Atlanta.

At the Friends Arena in Stockholm, a United fan held aloft a poster which read: \"Come on United, do it for Manchester.\" And they did, beating their Dutch opponents 2-0.Paul Pogba, the world's most expensive footballer and a man who, less than a fortnight ago, lost his father to a long-term illness, gave United the lead with a 25-yard deflected strike.

A sixth-place finish in the English Premier League meant United had to win this match if they wanted to secure Champions League qualification.Not only will Jose Mourinho's men be playing among Europe's elite next season, benefiting from the prestige and financial rewards that will bring, but the club has now completed its collection of major trophies.United are now only the fifth club -- alongside Ajax, Chelsea, Juventus and Bayern Munich -- to have won all three European trophies. \"If we could, we would obviously change the people's lives for this cup, immediately,\" Mourinho told reporters.\"We wouldn't think twice. Does this cup make the city of Manchester a little bit happier? Maybe. But we just came to do our job.\"We came without the happiness we should bring with us, because when you come for these big matches you come happy, you come proud. And we didn't. we just came to do our job.\"Paul Pogba, the world's most expensive footballer, scored Manchester United's first goal to give the English side a 1-0 lead at halftime (Photo by Alex Grimm/Getty Images)Not a time to critique performanceLast week there was talk that this match would determine the success of Mourinho's first season in charge at Old Trafford. The only manager in United's history to win a trophy in his first season -- his team won the League Cup in February and Community Shield in August -- Mourinho concludes the campaign with three trophies. But win or lose, with the identities of those who lost their lives on Monday continuing to be released, now would not have been the time to critique the team's performance. The scheduled minute's silence turned into a minute's applause before the final In Stockholm, a city recovering from its own terrorist atrocity after a stolen truck was driven into pedestrians on a busy shopping street, killing five, the consensus was that the pre-match mood was somber. A minute's silence held before the match turned into a minute's applause and United's players wore black armbands in tribute to those who had been killed and injured in Monday's terrorist attack. The squad celebrated their victory joyfully, with cries of \"ole! ole!\" Dab + billy dance = \ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udd25 pic.twitter.com/0OL2VAKQlM\u2014 Paul Pogba (@paulpogba) May 24, 2017\nCheers echoed around the arena as the club's captain Wayne Rooney, who came on as a second-half substitute, lifted the club's latest trophy aloft. \"We played for the people who died,\" Pogba told BT Sport.\"These things are terrible all over the world, in London and in Paris,\" added the French international, who was also playing at the Stade de France on the night of the November 2015 Paris terror attacks.\"We went out focused to win and we won for Manchester and the country.Ajax below parWith an average age of 22 years and 282 days, Ajax named the youngest side ever to start in a major European final. In defender Matthijs de Ligt, aged 17 and 285 days, they also had the youngest player to feature in a European final. Peter Bosz's men had sparkled in this competition on their way to the final, playing in a manner the coach describes as the \"Ajax way\" -- pressing quickly, passing swiftly.Henrikh Mkhitaryan scores Manchester United's second goal of the evening Bosz, in his first season, has revived the club -- although they did finish second in the Dutch top flight -- and is preaching the principles which originate from Johan Cruyff, the club's former player and coach. But Ajax were disappointing against a United side which defended smartly to stifle their opponents. Despite enjoying greater possession, Bosz's inexperienced team struggled in what was the club's first European final since 1996. JUST WATCHEDZlatan is steak?

Lone attacker? The suspect apparently acted as a lone attacker and died in the blast Monday night, police said, which left the wounded and the dead scattered across the arena's bloodied entrance and sent screaming girls running for cover. The bombing has drawn condemnation and horror from around the world as a heinous assault targeting children.Teen concertgoer Olivia Campbell, whose mother spoke to CNN during an agonizing wait for news from her daughter, is the latest victim to have been confirmed dead. Fifteen-year-old Olivia had gone to the concert with her friend Adam to celebrate his birthday.  She is one of four victims, including eight-year-old Saffie Rose Roussos, who have been identified.Olivia Campbell, 15, had been  confirmed as one of the dead. While police believe Abedi acted alone, May warned that investigators could not discount the possible involvement of a \"wider group\" of terrorists. The raising of the terror threat level means \"not only that another attack remains highly likely but that a further attack may be imminent,\" she said.It will enable the government to deploy armed military personnel of support of police and other security forces, particularly in the guarding of key sites, concerts and sporting events, May said.   Emergency crews evacuated victims at the Manchester Arena Monday night.\"I do not want the public to feel unduly alarmed,\" she said, calling the response \"proportionate and sensible\" to the threat level. The blast marked the deadliest terror attack on British soil since the 2005 London bombings. Claim of responsibilityISIS claimed responsibility for the attack but offered no evidence. The terror group said on its Telegram channel Tuesday that a \"soldier of the caliphate\" was able to \"plant explosive devices\" at the arena, a US counterterrorism source told CNN.ISIS routinely claims attacks it has no proven connection to.     Authorities have discovered no evidence of a link between the attacker and an established terror group, a British counterterrorism official told CNN. A US counterterrorism official said bombing \"looks much like\" an ISIS attack but that American intelligence officials were working with British counterparts to determine more.No determination has been made on the sophistication of the explosive device or what chemicals were involved, the official said. Remembering the victimsOn Tuesday evening, hundreds attended a vigil outside Manchester City Hall in honor of the victims.      Will and Catherine both live and work in Manchester. They've come to the vigil to show their solidarity with the victims and their families. \"This is where we live -- it's a tragedy what happened, and people need to stand together, there needs to be love, not hatred,\" said Will.

That the attacker went for the softest of soft targets -- children and teenagers packed into the enclosed space of a pop concert -- makes it all the more horrifying. As Prime Minister Theresa May said on Tuesday morning, the attack \"stands out for its appalling, sickening cowardice.\"Manchester Arena: 22 killed in Ariana Grande concert terror attackAlthough Monday's atrocity was particularly shocking in nature, Manchester and the wider United Kingdom have a long memory of terror attacks. For more than 30 years from the early 1970s, the Irish Republican Army (IRA), a paramilitary group, carried out multiple attacks across the UK.  The deadliest were the Birmingham pub bombings of 1974, when 21 were killed. In 1996, the IRA detonated a massive 1500-kilogram (3300-pound) bomb in a Manchester shopping center not far from Monday night's attack, injuring more than 200. The explosion destroyed buildings but a cast iron red postbox not far from the blast site remained unscathed; its image came to symbolize the resilience of the city. This is the postbox in Corporation Street which survived the IRA bomb in 1996. A symbol that Manchester will not back down. pic.twitter.com/p4lOa6KBbV\u2014 \ud83d\udcfb Colin Paterson \ud83d\udcfa (@ColinGPaterson) May 23, 2017\nEarly on Tuesday morning, a picture of the same iconic postbox was shared hundreds of times on Twitter to represent how Manchester would once again remain steadfast in the face of terror.Read MoreFrom the IRA to ISIS Photos: Deadly explosion at Ariana Grande concertPeople in Manchester, England, gather in St. Ann's Square on Thursday, May 25.

On July 7 2005, a cell of four British Muslim suicide bombers inspired by al Qaeda detonated devices on the London transit network, killing 52. Since then, successive British governments have warned the public to be on alert for terror attacks, elevating the threat level to \"severe\", the second highest alert. And the UK's homeland intelligence agency MI5 has thwarted dozens of terrorist plots, mainly involving British-born would-be attackers.Since 2013, attention has shifted to Britons returning from Syria who have been inspired by the terror group ISIS. In March, Mark Rowley, the highest ranking counter-terrorism official in the UK, said 13 terror attacks had been averted in the past four years. In a sign of the challenge facing the authorities, Rowley said there were up to 500 anti-terror investigations active at any one time. In their words: Witnesses describe horror of children attacked at concertWith the Paris attacks of November 2015 and the Nice truck atrocity of July 2016, British counter-intelligence officials were increasingly concerned at the prospect of marauding attackers or lone wolves using low-tech methods of guns, knives and vehicles to cause death and destruction -- plots that are harder to infiltrate than those involving sophisticated explosives. Those fears were realized on March 22 when Khalid Masood, a single attacker inspired by ISIS, drove into pedestrians on London's Westminster Bridge, killing four, before stabbing a policeman to death outside the House of Commons.But the improvised explosive device used at the Manchester Arena shows that the nature of the terrorism threat in the UK remains wide-ranging.Attack comes weeks before electionConcert bombing victims: Eight-year-old girl among deadIt is also the first terrorist attack to have taken place during a British general election. The timing has echoes of the Madrid train bombings of March 2004 that had a direct impact on Spanish Premier Jose Maria Aznar's defeat in the general election three days later, which was partly attributed to his handling of that atrocity. Yet it is unlikely the Manchester attack will change the outcome of the June 8 election, which Theresa May remains on course to win. Politicians from all sides will be wary of trying to score political points, particularly as campaigning has been suspended. If anything, voters feeling fearful of terrorism may be inclined to stick to the status quo and back a party led by a Prime Minister who has a background as an authoritarian Home Secretary and has pitched herself as the \"strong and stable\" candidate. While the nature of the attack and the age of the victims have caused national shock, politicians and religious leaders said the nation would be resolute.Please hold the people of #Manchester in your prayers. We've faced terror attacks before and this latest won't defeat us.\u2014 David Walker (@BishManchester) May 23, 2017\nThe Bishop of Manchester David Walker tweeted: \"Please hold the people of #Manchester in your prayers. We've faced terror attacks before and this latest won't defeat us.\"Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis wrote on Facebook: \"The devastation of these attacks, both at home and abroad, is becoming all too familiar but so too is the remarkable resolve with which we react to them ... When we are attacked by hate, we respond with love. Nothing and no one can divide us.\"My heart goes out to families who have lost loved ones, my admiration to our brave emergency services. A terrible night for our great city\u2014 Mayor Andy Burnham (@MayorofGM) May 23, 2017\nAndy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester who was a Home Office minister during the 2005 London bombings, said: \"London pulled together in exactly the same way Manchester, in its own unique way, will pull together and will stand strong and will stand together. We are grieving, we are hurt today but we are strong and this city has dealt with difficult days in the past and we will do so now.\" Johnny Mercer, a Conservative politician and former army officer, said: \"This is a cowardly act, the type of which we have tragically become familiar with over the last few years, although not often with the scale of tragic consequences of last night's atrocity. We live in an inherently safe country, where our security and emergency services work around the clock to keep us safe; these individuals want to disrupt our lives and draw attention to their dreadful cause, yet the majority of the time we live in isolation from their activities.\"My thoughts are solely with the families of those killed, and those injured as they fight for survival and put their lives back together in the years ahead.\"",

The prize is the Auld Mug -- the sterling silver America's Cup itself -- first awarded in 1851 and known as the oldest trophy in international sport.Read MoreHere's what you need to know.Bermuda will host the 35th America's Cup in May and June 2017.What's the format? The event begins with the Louis Vuitton qualifiers, a round-robin matchracing competition from May 26-June 3 before the knockout series of challenger playoffs from June 4-12.The America's Cup Revolution has seen the shift to stadium-style racing, in venues like Bermuda's Great Sound: https://t.co/IDiNE4XYvr pic.twitter.com/oGynejRsC1\u2014 America's Cup (@americascup) May 4, 2017\nThe 35th America's Cup between the victorious challenger and defender Oracle Team USA (which also takes part in the qualifiers) is scheduled for June 17-18 and June 24-27.  Each race will last 20-25 minutes and involve several upwind and downwind legs on Bermuda's Great Sound before finishing in front of the America's Cup race village.This \"stadium racing\" is an evolution of the last Cup in San Francisco Bay in 2013 and is designed to be more fan and TV friendly to attract a new audience. \"From a sailing perspective and also a fan perspective it is a great thing to bring the racing in close,\" says America's Cup chief executive Russell Coutts, a three-time Cup-winning skipper.In another break with tradition, all six teams have been racing against each other in practice on the Great Sound, throwing up some early contenders and generating plenty of gossip. It's been a time of intrigue and scrutiny as hands are revealed for the first time. Have they been showing their full potential? Probably not. Are they all up to speed? Not yet. Are there upgrades to come in equipment and new crew configurations in the pipeline? You bet.The Defender  Oracle Team USA, skippered by Australian Jimmy Spithill. The Americans, bankrolled by Larry Ellison, are aiming for a three-repeat after that remarkable 9-8 victory from 8-1 down against Team New Zealand in San Francisco. The team includes Australian Olympic Laser gold medalist Tom Slingsby as tactician. The Americans have appeared quick in practice, but they suffered a scare recently when they capsized, although no-one was hurt and no damage was done to the boat.\"We've shown that we are a hard team to close out. We're going to fight until the final race, win or lose. The other teams know that,\" Slingsby told Oracle's website.

Land Rover BAR won the 2015-2016 World Series warm-up circuit, but has struggled with the pace of some of the other teams in practice in Bermuda. Ainslie played down the incident with Team New Zealand, calling it a \"love tap.\" \"I wouldn't lay my cards down on who's got the speed or not until we start racing in the qualifiers,\" Ainslie told CNN. \"That will be the true gauge of where the teams are.

Japanese sailing great Kazuhiko Sofuku is also on the team alongside countrymen Yugo Yoshida and Yuki Kasatani. Britain's Olympic bronze medalist Chris Draper is tactician and sailing team manager. The team have worked closely with Oracle in the build-up. \"Every day you go out on the water everyone is still improving at a very rapid rate,\" Barker told AmericasCup.com. \"It definitely rings true for us that there are always gains to be had right from the first race to the last race that you do.\"Groupama Team France is another newcomer and is led by round-the-world and offshore sailing great Franck Cammas.The multihull expert and winning Volvo Ocean Race skipper nearly lost his foot when he was thrown under the foils during a training accident in 2015. The French are considered underdogs in Bermuda with a learning curve described as \"exponential\" by grinder Nicholas Heintz.The boatsThe boats are essentially identical 48-foot -- reduced from 72ft in 2013 -- twin-hulled catamarans with a 77ft high rigid wing sail, which rise out of the water on hydrofoils the size of surfboards to sail three times faster than the speed of the wind and more than 50 mph.The America's Cup has always been about pushing the limits of technology in sailing, and foiling is no exception: https://t.co/UA4UFGPzk3 pic.twitter.com/sOGjNHUvzh\u2014 America's Cup (@americascup) May 3, 2017\nThe cutting-edge design element comes in the foil packages, and the systems developed to move the hydraulic power around more efficiently.With no stored power, all the energy to drive the hydraulics, which adjust the wing and lower and raise the daggerboards which support the foils, must come from the crew.  Foiling -- when the hulls rise out of the water -- is the fastest way to sail as it reduces friction. It was first introduced in 2013 when the Kiwis spotted a loophole in the laws, and forced the other teams to scramble to catch up. It has since exploded across every discipline of sailing.The optimum state is \"stable flight,\" when the boat maintains a consistent platform on its foils, particularly through turns. Foiling gybes (when the stern passes through the wind) became the norm in 2013, foiling tacks (bow turns through the wind) are now the holy grail.\"The game changer for me was foiling, we got lucky really,\" Percy told reporters at a news conference on London.\"Not only did it provide speed, which was apparent immediately, but it allowed racing to be very tactical because boats could turn very fast without losing speed.\"The modern America's Cup boats \"fly\" out of the water on hydrofoils.The sailorsThe AC 45Fs are manned by a crew of six, broadly divided into the roles of helmsman, wing trimmer, a tactician who doubles as a grinder and three other grinders.We challenged fitness expert @RossEdgley to an intense @americascup sailor gym session. Find out how he got on https://t.co/vicN7cPhGW pic.twitter.com/ZIixacxzlI\u2014 Land Rover BAR (@LandRoverBAR) April 12, 2017\nRules limit the total crew weight to 525kg, meaning an average of 87.5 kg per man (they are all men). Teams tend to save weight in their rear two sailors (helm and wing trimmer) to add to the engine room (the grinders). In pre-2013 Cups grinders were 100kg-plus giants capable of short bursts of power. Now, endurance is key as they need to keep grinding for the entire duration of a race. Training programmes have changed accordingly and sailors have become elite endurance athletes, and in the case of Team New Zealand, elite cyclists.\"It's beyond anything physical I've ever done,\" Percy told CNN.Artemis have been setting the pace in practice racing in Bermuda.The historyThe America's Cup began with a race around Britain's Isle of Wight in 1851. The winner was the US yacht \"America,\" which received a silver jug -- renamed the America's Cup -- as its prize.Since then the competition has been seen by many as the pinnacle of sailing incorporating the best technology at the time and the best sailors. It was dominated by American syndicates until Australian businessman Alan Bond's Australia II beat Dennis Conner's Liberty in Newport in 1983. The Americans dominated again until 1995 when Team New Zealand won and defended the Cup in 2000.Swiss outfit Alinghi, bankrolled by biotech billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli and with a host of Kiwi defectors, ruled in 2003 and 2007 before Oracle Team USA began their reign. The fierce competition and boundary-pushing technology has led to much intrigue and controversy over the years with legal rulings seemingly as much part of the Cup as the sailing. Team New Zealand beat Italy's Prada 5-0 in the 2000 America's Cup in Auckland.Why Bermuda? The winner of the America's Cup decides where the next one will take place and its format. Oracle Team USA moved away from San Francisco which it had chosen for 2013 and settled on Bermuda.The Atlantic archipelago is composed of 181 islands, totaling 21 square miles, and has just over 60,000 residents.

        "content": "Manchester, England (CNN)It was 16-year-old Caitlin Haywood's very first concert. She and her best friend had traveled from the town of Mansfield to see US singer Ariana Grande perform at a packed Manchester Arena.The night should've been a joyous rite of passage for Caitlin and thousands of other teenagers who crowded into the venue to see the show. Instead, the bomb blast that claimed 22 lives and injured scores of others, left her   traumatized and contemplating an uncertain future.  Caitlin Haywood: \"I'm still just shaking constantly.\"\"I'm still very shocked,\" she told CNN, just hours after she scrambled out of the venue in search of her parents, who had been dining nearby.Read More\"I'm absolutely terrified as well because I never thought that would happen. I'm still just shaking constantly and I felt very unsafe.\"While a somber but defiant Manchester was coming to terms with the horror of an attack that appeared to target mainly young adults and children, Caitlin was trying to process what had happened to her.\"The tickets were very expensive and it was a one-time only experience, but for this to be my first-ever experience with an artist I really liked... I'm really disappointed that someone decided to do this.\"Caitlin says she and her friend were able to leave the arena and were quickly in touch with her mom by phone.\"They actually felt it and heard it. They were just down the road, sitting down, waiting for us to finish and they felt it and they rushed over.\"'Like a scene from \"Titanic\"'Joseph Harries: \"I'm exhausted, very shaky still.\"Caitlin's friend Joseph Harries, 16, says paying extra to get good seats close to the stage where Grande was performing, may have saved their lives as it meant they were far from the explosion. \"She finished her final song, 'Dangerous Woman,' and it was spectacular, she did a fantastic job -- but once that song had finished and all the lights came back on, we heard this huge explosion at the back of the arena.\"It was like a scene from 'Titanic.' People were running back in, screaming. It was horrendous... we had to get out of there as fast as we possibly could. We ended up having to climb up over seats, over railings to try and get out.\"Reeling from shockHe too says he's still reeling from the shock, not just from his own experiences but at the wider implications of the attack.\"I haven't got a lot of sleep. I'm exhausted, very shaky still and, honestly, I just I'm more shaken that somebody could do this to a place full of young impressionable girls and boys.He adds: \"I feel like I'll be a bit more wary when considering the choices of places and things that I end up doing in the future.\"Caitlin's dad, 46-year-old technology worker Nick Haywood, says he saw crowds of distressed people pouring from the venue as he hunted for his daughter. Nick Haywood: \"You can't let this stop you doing what you enjoy doing.\"\"My heart goes out to the parents who aren't in our situation -- who didn't find their kids,\" he says. Haywood says he helped ferry other children around the police cordons to find their own parents.  \"I was just trying to get people reunited, but I feel really bad for them -- the parents and children who haven't found each other yet.\"He says most of the concertgoers were young girls between the ages of 10 and 19. \"And for someone to do something like this at a concert for that age group, that demographic, it just boggles belief. You just can't understand how they could do that.\"It's hard for me because I found my children but I saw the relief of parents just hugging the hell out of their kids, the relief that their child is back to them safe and sound. So I can't imagine what parents must be going through when they haven't found their child yet.\"While his daughter says she's unsure if she'd ever go to a concert again, Haywood strikes a more resilient tone. \"They are very rare occurrences. I feel really awful for the families of those killed and those injured... it should have been such a fun occasion,\" he says.\"You can't let this stop you doing what you enjoy doing. It's not going to stop us going out.\"",

The deadliest attack on British soil since the 2005 London bombings has left a country in mourning and police searching for answers. Here's what we know -- and don't know -- so far.  What we know     \u2022 At least 22 people, including children, were killed in the blast, which rocked Manchester Arena at around 10:35 p.m. local time (5:30 p.m. ET) as fans were leaving the venue.\u2022 Three victims have been named, including an 8-year-old girl, an 18-year-old woman and a 26-year-old man.Read More\u2022 At least 59 people were injured. Police said that victims were taken to eight area hospitals for treatment. \u2022 Police have named 22-year-old Salman Abedi as the suspected bomber. He is believed to have died in the powerful blast but has not yet been identified by the coroner, according to police.\u2022 Abedi was born in the United Kingdom in 1994, according to Prime Minister Theresa May. \u2022 He is of Libyan descent, sources in Manchester's Libyan community told CNN.\u2022 ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, but offered no evidence to support the claim.\u2022 The UK raised its terrorism threat level to \"critical\" -- the highest level -- for the first time in a decade on Tuesday.\u2022 Prime Minister May warned that intelligence services believe an attack may be \"imminent.\" \u2022 Police have arrested a 23-year-old man in connection with the attack.\u2022 Police have conducted at least two raids in Manchester as part of the investigation.

I have no doubt he's going to be quick enough, but you need everything to fall in to place.\"'Incredible atmosphere'Whether he's pouring milk over his head or not at the end of 200 grueling laps, Alonso will sample an atmosphere unlike anything he has experienced in F1 -- an estimated 300,000 spectators will attend the race.\"The atmosphere is incredible at Indianapolis,\" says Franchitti, champion in 2007, 2010 and 2012.\"I didn't actually appreciate it until I retired ... my job before that was to completely block all that out so to actually enjoy it was something incredible.Dario Franchitti poses with the Borg Warner Trophy after his third Indy 500 victory in 2012.\"You realize what a big event it is, and when you win it you understand what it means to the team you worked with as well -- whether it's the guy building the engines, the mechanics on the car.\" For Alonso, who has been starved of F1 success in recent seasons in an under-performing McLaren car, the Indy 500 gives him a genuine shot at glory that would otherwise be unavailable.\"There are 33 cars on the grid and around 20 of those have a realistic shot of winning that race,\" Franchitti says.  \"You will not know until the cars leave Turn 4 on the last lap who has got it -- they might be racing to the line!\"If Alonso does manage to pull it off he will become the first F1 world champion to win the race since Jacques Villeneuve 22 years ago.Fernando Alonso's appearance at the Indy 500 means he will miss F1's Monaco Grand Prix.\"Indy is a strange beast,\" Villeneuve says. \"You can win it with speed and talent like (Juan Pablo) Montoya did in 2015 or you can have a little bit of luck -- like (Alexander) Rossi did last year when it goes well with the fuel. \"You have to be there for the whole race. You have to bide your time and throw the dice. It could go his way. \"He's probably with the best team to come as a one off, basically. The Andretti team have done that in the past are they are very good at having the extra car and making that extra car run fast.\" The odds may be stacked against Alonso -- only nine rookies have won the Indy 500 in its 100-year history -- but his commitment will be unswerving.\"I'm not coming for a 'week off' or to just have fun ... I am coming to race,\" he says.\"The Indy 500 is one of the greatest events in the sport. Drivers all over the world know this. I belong there.

For Andrea, upstaging the competition was simple. \"We felt like another rival, as if it was normal, because in fact, it is,\" she said. \"We were going to compete, and that's it.\"The girls, ages 12 to 14, were crowned champions for the first time on March 31. They won 22 matches, and were so far ahead of their competition that they earned the title four games before the season ended, according to the team's GoFundMe page. Read More\"This achievement is the result of a bet that started in the club 8 seasons ago for women 's soccer and they have called us crazy a few times,\" the fundraising page states. \"I do not know if we're crazy and mad, but what I do know is that the way here has not been easy: our players have reached the top through effort and sacrifice, like any other athlete. \"The girls from AEM Lleida are in a local junior division league and have been playing against boys' teams for three years -- a decision made by their club after seeing their potential.Overcoming the oddsIn Spain, women's soccer still has a long way to go to reach the impact it has in other countries. In the 2015-2016 season, more than 112,000 boys were enrolled to play, compared with fewer than 4,000 girls, according to the Spanish football federation.Though the girls said their gender didn't limit them, Andrea recalls enduring insults.\"There was a match in which a referee told us that we were 'Barbies' and that we could not play soccer. Or a mother who insulted us and told us that we had to go and clean,\" she said.The players say part of their success owes to their coach, who has believed in them and prepared them to beat their male rivals.The game plan\"What we planned from the beginning with the girls is that if we wanted to beat the boys, we would have to have the ball much more than them because, in strength and speed, we cannot compete against them,\" said Daniel Rodrigo, the team coach.Rodrigo also had to convince some skeptical parents, but they finally decided to cheer their girls' success.And while the thought of girls competing with boys raised some adults' eyebrows, their rivals often welcomed the competition.La Noguera club was one of the hardest teams to beat last season, but the boys recognized that the girls of AEM Lleida won because they were superior. \"They fought more than us. We also worked hard, but they wanted to win the league, and they deserved it,\" La Noguera player Alex L\u00f3pez said.And Rodrigo is betting on his team setting an example for future generations of female players.",

The British Prime Minister who has a tiny majority in Parliament, is embarking on a Brexit process that has divided her party and her country, and has performed u-turns on everything from tax to her decision to call this election. She has refused to directly debate her opponent, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, on live television, and is rumored to be engaged in a strategy war with her Treasury chief, Philip Hammond.Her one-time rival for the Conservative leadership, George Osborne, is now the editor of a London newspaper from where he takes daily swipes at her agenda, calling her \"politically rash\" and \"economically illiterate\".And yet May seems unassailable. UK Prime Minister Theresa May launches the Conservatives' election manifesto on May 18, 2017.Read More'Tight ship'There is not a squeak of public disloyalty from her own politicians, and -- unlike her counterpart in the White House -- her chiefs of staff Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill run a tight ship in Downing Street, where no one dares leak against her. Her manifesto  -- a political party's guide to its key policies -- contains plenty of controversial measures that will take money away from the middle classes, including wealthier pensioners and children, and leaves the door open to tax rises, an agenda that would normally incur the wrath of the Daily Mail, the popular newspaper that fiercely protects \"Middle England\".British Prime Minister Theresa May speaks to workers at a distribution center in Stoke-on-Trent.Read: Theresa May: A British authoritarian?But May's plans for the elderly, which include taking money from their estates after death to pay for their care, and removing \u00a3200 a year handouts to pay for fuel bills from all but the poorest pensioners, were given the gentlest of coverage.

May has pulled off an extraordinary coup.Key to her success is message discipline. The Prime Minister has repeated the phrase \"strong and stable\" dozens of times over the past few weeks, and there is evidence it is cutting through.

        "content": "Story highlightsBarcelona celebrating 25th anniversary of first European Cup win 1992 Wembley win created a lasting legacyClub has now won five European Cups (CNN)There was a time when Barcelona fans did not expect success. To wallow in pessimism was the accepted norm. Trophies? Titles? They were for others, usually the reserve of the grandiose club of the capital, Real Madrid. The European Cup was as elusive as the unicorn: talked about, looked at with wonder, pictured with others but never seen in this Catalonian city by the Mediterranean sea.A club like Barcelona, the nihilistic fans would say, would never reach the zenith of European club football. There was no bombast, no peacocking, just fatalism. The ironhanded years of General Francisco Franco, whose dictatorial regime had crushed Catalonia's earlier limited autonomy, had ruined the spirit. True, Barcelona had been able to sign football greats such as Johan Cruyff and Diego Maradona, but two European Cup finals -- in 1961 and 1986 -- had ended in defeat and between 1961 and 1990, the club won just two league titles in Spain's top flight, finishing runners up 13 times. Read MoreBut all changed on May 20, 1992.That was the day Barcelona won its first European Cup. That was the day the club, its city, and football was transformed.JUST WATCHEDXavi hails Barca's 1992 Dream TeamReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHXavi hails Barca's 1992 Dream Team 01:54Barcelona's 'Holy Grail' Springtime in London. Cruyff, the football revolutionary, now Barcelona's visionary coach, and his assembled team of artists, known as the \"Dream Team,\" are at Wembley for the first European Cup final of the Dutchman's managerial reign. Opponents Sampdoria have poachers supreme in Gianluca Vialli and Roberto Mancini, but Barcelona can offset the Italians with Michael Laudrup, Pep Guardiola, Hirsto Stoichkov and Ronald Koeman. Barcelona Team Group. (Back Row L-R) Andoni Zubizarreta, Nando, Julio Salinas, Ronald Koeman, Michael Laudrup, Hristo Stoichkov, Eusebio Sacristan, (Front Row L-R) Jose Mari Bakero, Albert Ferrer, Josep Guardiola, Juan CarlosIf it's a title-winning team of regal talent, Barcelona's fans, however, are preparing for the worst.Memories of the club's European Cup final defeat on penalties to Steaua Bucharest in 1986 are still fresh so supporters ask Cruyff to record a few soothing words for the return journey to Spain, a precaution should the worst happen.But Cruyff, in his fourth year as Barca manager, wants his players to forget about the club's past. His battle cry as he sends his men out onto the Wembley turf? \"Go out there and enjoy it.\" \"The European Cup was the football holy grail for Barcelona,\" Graham Hunter -- author of \"Barca, the making of the greatest team in the world\" -- tells CNN. \"It was more than a thorn in their side. It was something that was almost mythical, to get to that final and win it.\"Full-time turns into extra-time and the score remains goalless. Knees are knocking, in the stands and in the dugout. Penalties are looming. Fear. But with less than 10 minutes remaining Barcelona is awarded a free-kick. Koeman, the sweeper with a sniper's eye for long-range goals, steps forward. Watching on television in Barcelona is a teenaged Xavi, an academy player who would go on to become one of the club's greats. \"It was truly an extraordinary experience,\" the former Spain and Barcelona midfielder tells CNN as he remembers the match unfolding.Twenty-five yards from goal, Koeman shoots. He aims low towards the bottom corner. Defenders rush forwards, breaking from the defensive wall. The goalkeeper stretches and dives to his right. But they're all too late. They are beaten. Koeman scored 102 goals in 354 games during his career The goalscorer sprints towards the sidelines and his teammates follow, swallowing him up in a jubilant wave of orange shirts when he is caught. When the blond Dutchman emerges from the celebratory mass, he is hiding his face in his hands, using his fingertips to hold back tears. His is the winning goal, a strike which unshackles his club from the heavy weight of history. \"It was the beginning of big changes,\" Koeman, who pulled on Barca's blue and garnet shirt over his orange top before lifting the European Cup, would later say. Cruyff's Dream Team won four successive league titles between 1990 and 1994The genius from AmsterdamCruyff had made an impact at the Camp Nou as a player, winning the title in his first season following a world-record move in 1973, but it was the Dutchman's appointment as coach in 1988 that changed the club's DNA.On May 4, when Cruyff is announced as Barcelona's coach, the team is experiencing its worst season since 1941-42.  The club is in debt and in crisis.  They go on to finish sixth in the league, two points off 10th place, while Real Madrid celebrate a fifth straight La Liga title. Ignominy. He had, Cruyff said, inherited players who \"wanted to have fights about the past.\" Cruyff died, aged 68, in 2016In planning for the future a manic period of departures and arrivals follows -- 15 players are sold and 12 are bought. Cruyff, one of the greatest players of all time, took risks but rewards followed. Among the newcomers are the young and eager Txiki Begiristain, Jose Mari Bakero, Julio Salinas and Eusebio Sacristan, a quartet which would become crucial cogs in the manager's Dream Team. \"They were conditioned to coming second,\" says Hunter of the Barcelona squad Cruyff inherited. \"He felt there was a losing mentality around Catalonia itself and that this was a product of years of oppression under the Franco dictatorship. Commenting on another tragic day had become a habit.\"To accompany the change of personnel, came a shift in style. Naturally, Cruyff -- a three-time European Cup winner with Ajax -- wanted to win, but there was a way of winning. A philosophy, an identity. In the era of 4-4-2, the young manager introduced the 3-4-3 formation -- an adaptation of the 4-3-3 system Cruyff had played under the coaching pioneer Rinus Michels for the Netherlands and Ajax in the 1970s. Cruyff reached the 1974 World Cup final with the Netherlands, who were lauded for their 'Total Football' style, but were beaten 2-1 by West Germany\"We couldn't believe how many attackers were in the team,\" Eusebio, who made more than 250 appearances under Cruyff, said of the day the boss first drew three defenders, four midfielders, two out-and-out wingers and a center-forward on the blackboard. This radical change would require players to be comfortable interchanging positions. They would have to press, they would have to pass swiftly. Possession would reign supreme, which was not an easy task in a club where defenders were usually jeered for passing the ball back to the goalkeeper. For Cruyff to implement this cerebral approach, he needed a production line to supply him with possession-hungry players. Cue the overhauling of La Masia, the club's academy. Barcelona would never be the same again. Differentiating Barcelona from the restEvery team, from the under-eights to Barcelona's B team, were ordered to play the revolutionary 3-4-3, with an emphasis on technique rather than physique, another volte-face for a club which, as recently as 1986, selected young players based on whether they would be taller than 1.80m. First off the conveyor belt were Albert Ferrer, Guillermo Amor and Guardiola, the 1992 history-makers.JUST WATCHEDXavi hails Barca's 1992 Dream TeamReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH (9 Videos)Xavi hails Barca's 1992 Dream TeamXavi: I'm open to managing Qatar in 2022Barcelona legend Xavi reveals Ultimate PlayerTer Stegen: 'Messi is the greatest ever'Pep Guardiola: 'No bigger title than to follow Cruyff legacy'The business behind GuardiolaMeet the Iranian Messi dopplegangerGuardiola to end Barcelona reign Barcelona: A guide to the Catalan city For Carlos Hugo Garcia Bayon, a former assistant coach at Barcelona B, winning the European Cup with academy graduates in the side was confirmation that Cruyff's methods worked. Bayon tells CNN: \"It was that victory which changed the culture and mentality of the club. They won the European Cup, but won it playing a specific style and with a lot of players from La Masia. \"It was something unique, something that differentiated us from others. \"Without a doubt, if you have a methodology and that methodology doesn't win, you are going to lose confidence to play players from the academy.\"Cesc Fabregas, one of La Masia's graduates, holds aloft the World Cup trophy after Spain won the 2010 finalFrom that famous Wembley win, other world class seedlings blossomed at the La Masia hothouse: Xavi, Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta, Carles Puyol, Gerard Pique, Cesc Fabregas, to name but a few.All of them, bar Messi, integral to not only Barcelona's success but that of the Spain team which won the World Cup in 2010 and two consecutive European Championships in 2008 and 2012. \"They were the generation who paved the way for us,\" says Xavi of the European Cup-winning Dream Team. \"They gave Barcelona a winning mentality. It was an example for all of us.\" Hunter says academy players grew up \"thinking anything was possible\" after seeing the likes of Guardiola succeed on the biggest stage of all.  \"The brand of football we saw from 2003-12, the unbroken stretch of success, those types of players, the promotion from the youth system, the attitude, the winning mentality, all of these have geneses in the Wembley victory over Sampdoria,\" he says.'Now you have it here'From Wembley to Barcelona and a dizzying week of celebrations for the club's European pioneers.On the balcony of Placa de Sant Jaume, stood Cruyff's men, soaking up the adulation of their fans, holding aloft the European Cup. Fantasy had become reality. A 21-year-old Guardiola, the Catalan symbol, shouted: \"Citizens of Catalonia -- now you have it here.\" The midfielder, says Hunter, had prepared in advance, modifying a phrase used by Josep Tarradellas, named \"President in absentia\" by his people in 1954 during the Franco dictatorship, when on the same balcony in the city's gothic quarter 15 years earlier. The Dream Team's European success, combined with the Olympic Games which was held in the city later that summer, transformed Barcelona and its people. Hunter describes the summer of 92 as the \"one of the most important summers in the history of Barcelona and Catalonia.\" The football club, whose slogan is 'more than a club' for its defense of the Catalan culture and language, became Catalonia's most important institution. The radical shift was not solely on the pitch.      Spreading the Cruyff gospelNovember 25, 2012, the day the teachings of Cruyff, his vision for a team full of La Masia pass masters becomes reality. Barcelona is playing Levante in a league game. In the 14th minute Martin Montoya replaces Brazilian full-back Dani Alves. It is the first time in Barcelona's history that the entire first team comprises of players who graduated through the club's now famed academy. It is the legacy of Cruyff and the 1992 European Cup win. \"La Masia is a football school but also a school of values, a school of life,\" explains Xavi.\"It is something to feel proud about. We now have 20 to 25 years of harvesting titles for Barcelona and playing an attractive style of football for the fans.\"Guardiola won 14 trophies from a possible 19 in his four years as Barcelona coachGuardiola, the great player who became the club's most successful coach, has often said that he and other Barcelona managers have simply been restoring, or improving, the chapel that Cruyff painted. The Catalan himself created a football masterpiece, winning 14 trophies in four golden seasons between 2008 and 2012 with one of the greatest teams in history, the heart of which were other wordly academy talents. For Bayon, currently academy director at Celta Vigo, the transformation of the Dream Team from playing greats to high-class managers is another lasting legacy of that 1992 win, with Cruyff's former players spreading his gospel in various leagues around the world. In England there is Guardiola at Manchester City and Koeman at Everton, while Eusebio is in La Liga. The latter two are being linked with succeeding Luis Enrique as Barca boss when he leaves at the end of this season. There are others too: Michael Laudrup managing in Qatar, Txiki Begiristain, an unused substitute at Wembley, as sporting director at Manchester City and Andoni Zubizarreta in Marseille as the French club's sporting director.  \"They have become great managers, that's one of the most important thing from that victory. It generated a culture of coaching. It is not only to generate great players, but great coaches,\" says Bayon.      An identity changedAnd so, to the future. What about the Barcelona of today?Under Enrique, who will depart at the end of the season having won the Champions League and two Spanish titles, does the legacy of Wembley 1992 still run through the side like letters in a stick of rock? Of the title-chasing Barcelona team which started in the 4-1 victory over Las Palmas on May 14, only four players -- Sergio Busquets, Messi, Iniesta and Jordi Alba -- had played for the academy. Alba, released by the club in 2005, was repatriated seven years later at a cost of 14 million euros ($15.49m) from Valencia. Possession has not always been king for Enrique's Barcelona, although there have been significant departures during the Spaniard's reign. Aged 35, Xavi left in 2015 to play in Qatar, following another academy great, Carles Puyol, who retired in 2014, out of the Camp Nou. Suarez, Messi and Neymar have been lethal goalscorers for Luis Garcia's Barcelona\"No youth system will be able to produce that generation repeatedly on demand,\" says Hunter. \"It's just not feasible, but the tail-off has been pretty dramatic and has inevitably changed the football Barcelona play. \"When you sign from outside they don't have the same aptitude, they don't speak the same football language. \"There are fewer youth products available to Enrique than there were to (Frank) Riijkard and Guardiola and it's also been a strategic idea that the front three -- Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez -- need to be given the ball more quickly and with less elaboration because they're different strikers to any in the club's history. \"They need less work, they're able to score on their own so the midfield is sometimes bypassed.\"The identity of the first-team football in the last two-and-a-half years has significantly changed, but the actual existence of the youth system in unchallenged, it's part of their identity.\"Who would make the cut in your Barcelona Dream Team?

That would be the most dramatic induction of Cruyff and Guardiola values into the club.\"Academy graduate Messi is Barcelona's all-time leading goalscorer, netting over 500 times for the club How different would Barcelona's history be had they not won in 1992? The trophy cabinet tells a story: Three league titles in the 25 years leading up to the Dream Team's European Cup success, 13 thereafter and four nights of Champions League glory -- a total of 44 trophies in 25 years and their status as one of the sport's dominant forces fixed. Pessimism replaced with confidence, fatalism defeated, and the club's global status only reinforced by the style -- dubbed tiki-taka -- that accompanied that success.Had Barcelona not won in 1992, they may have had greater motivation, Hunter argues, in the 1994 Champions League final against AC Milan, which they lost 4-0. \"They were complacent, they believed they would win for sure,\" he says. But without European success under Cruyff there is less glue to hold his system in place. Visit cnn.com/tennis for more news and videos\"You can't say whether they would have won other Champions Leagues because each of the Champions Leagues subsequently won after 1992 have direct lineage to Cruyff and his beliefs,\" says Hunter. \"With no trophy under Cruyff then Barcelona's history is subsequently going to be much poorer and the trophy cabinet is going to be more barren. \"No European Cup win under Cruyff and the subsequent history, which we've become so used to -- the signing of Messi, the recruitment of Iniesta -- probably wouldn't have happened.\"",

That is not acceptable.\" Assange added that WikiLeaks would continue regardless of \"the threats towards me and my staff\" before hailing the release of Chelsea Manning, the former Army intelligence analyst who provided classified information to WikiLeaks in 2010.Before his balcony appearance on Friday, Assange, now 45, took to Twitter to share an an old image of himself smiling. pic.twitter.com/dDvB1Vekhg\u2014 Julian Assange (@JulianAssange) May 19, 2017\nA lawyer for one of the Swedish women who accused Assange of sexual assault said the prosecution decision to drop the investigation was a \"scandal.\" Is he facing US charges?Authorities in the United States have prepared charges to seek his arrest, US officials familiar with the matter told CNN last month.The Justice Department investigation of Assange and WikiLeaks dates to at least 2010, when the site first gained wide attention for posting thousands of files stolen by Manning.Julian Assange has been living in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for almost five years.Britain and the US have an extradition treaty, so if Assange leaves the Ecuadorian Embassy where he's claimed asylum, the British could arrest him and send him to the US.Barry Pollack, an attorney in Washington representing Assange, said the British should allow Assange to travel to Ecuador. \"The decision by the Swedish prosecutor only highlights the fact Mr. Assange has been unlawfully detained for years,\" Pollack said. \"At this point, it is more apparent than ever that the UK should provide Mr. Assange safe passage to Ecuador.  Ecuador has granted Mr. Assange asylum.  Recent comments by the United States attorney general and director of the CIA  demonstrate the obvious need of Mr. Assange for asylum.  The UK no longer has any legitimate basis to interfere with Ecuador's lawful decision.\"The UK government declined to comment Friday on whether the US has asked for Assange's extradition, but last month US Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Assange's arrest was a \"priority.\"What did Sweden say?Sweden's chief prosecutor Marianne Ny told a news conference in Sweden that the decision to discontinue the preliminary investigation into the rape allegations, which date back to 2010, had been made because \"all possibilities to advance the investigation have now been exhausted.\"JUST WATCHEDWikiLeaks founder lashes out at the CIAReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWikiLeaks founder lashes out at the CIA 02:36However, if Assange were to return to Sweden before the statute of limitations for the suspected offenses expires in August 2020, the investigation could be reopened, she said.Dropping the investigation is not a result of deciding he is not guilty, Ny added -- it's because there's no practical way to continue it. \"The decision to discontinue the preliminary investigation is not because we've been able to make a full assessment of the evidence in this case, but because we didn't see any possibilities to advance the investigation forward. So we don't make any statements on the issue of guilt,\" she said via a translator.Lawyer: Accuser 'shocked'Elizabeth Massi Fritz, the lawyer for Assange's accuser, criticized the Swedish authorities' decision in a statement to CNN.\"It is a scandal that a suspected rapist is able to evade the judicial system and thus avoid trial,\" Fritz said. \"Evidence in the case is available and that evidence should have been tested in court.\"Fritz said the process had dragged on for too long and that her client was \"shocked\" by the decision to drop it now. \"To conduct a preliminary investigation for so many years and today make a decision to close the investigation is something I am very critical of,\" she said. Fritz also called for a review of parts of the judicial process, including how Sweden tries suspects who deliberately avoid court for years.\"He has acted like this consciously and his fear must be that he is afraid of being sentenced for rape. Nobody wants to be sentenced for rape because it's a terrible and humiliating crime,\" she concluded.CNN is not naming the alleged victim whom Fritz represents.What's next for Assange?Possible US charges aside, Assange is still subject to an arrest warrant in the UK after he failed to surrender to Westminster Magistrates' Court in June 2012, London's Metropolitan Police Service said Friday.WikiLeaks slams CIA director for trying to 'stifle speech'However, it noted that now that the Swedish authorities had dropped their investigation, Assange was \"wanted for a much less serious offence\" than before and said the force would \"provide a level of resourcing which is proportionate to that offence.\"It added: \"The priority for the MPS must continue to be arresting those who are currently wanted in the Capital in connection with serious violent or sexual offences for the protection of Londoners.\"Journalist Per Nyberg reported from Stockholm, while CNN's Laura Smith-Spark and Lauren Said-Moorhouse wrote from London.

The image outraged many in Turkey, prompting an outpouring of anger on social media. The aide, identified as Yusuf Yerkel by Turkish media and CNN Turk, reportedly said he was deeply saddened by the events. \"I am sad that I could not keep my calm in the face of all the provocation, insults, and attacks that I was subjected to that day,\" he said, according to Turkey's semi-official Anadolu news agency.UN brawlIn September 2011, a brawl erupted between members of then Prime Minister Erdogan's security detail and United Nations security officers in the halls of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.A UN guard was reportedly taken to hospital with an injury after the incident.Several days later, a spokesman for the UN Secretary General issued a statement about \"some unfortunate misunderstandings involving security between UN uniformed officials and security officials of member delegations.\"A UN spokesman went on to tell journalists the issue had been resolved, and \"necessary action has also been taken to prevent such misunderstandings in the future.State Dept: 'Concerned'After this week's assault by Turkish security officials against protesters in front of the Turkish ambassador's residence in Washington, the US State Department said it was \"communicating our concern to the Turkish government in the strongest possible terms.\"A statement from the Turkish embassy argued \"Turkish-Americans responded in self-defense.\"Critics argue the violence illustrates the much broader pattern of human rights abuses in Turkey.\"Clearly Erdogan's guards feel complete impunity, drawing on tools of repression they use at home & knowing he has their back, no matter what,\" wrote former US ambassador to the UN Samantha Power on Twitter.Clearly Erdogan's guards feel complete impunity, drawing on tools of repression they use  at home & knowing he has their back,no matter what https://t.co/jq1tFHwv35\u2014 Samantha Power (@SamanthaJPower) May 17, 2017\nIn the 15 years that Erdogan has served as prime minister and president of Turkey, there has been a broad trend to crack down on freedom of the press and expressions of public dissent.Turkey is frequently ranked as the world's top jailer of journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.Why Trump is cozying up to strongman leaders",

Read MoreChampagne will be probably sprayed around the dressing room in celebration, which might just resonate with Buffon given he's launched his own wine brand. Swapping the goalmouth he regularly patrols for vineyards, Buffon's venture involves the production of a line of wines in the historic cellar of Novoli, Southern Italy, in the Apulia region famed for its wine-making traditions.The grapes of enjoyment ... Buffon savours a glass of his own win.Fabio Cordella, the man who is helping Buffon in this new venture and owner of the cellar \"Fabio Cordella Cantine,\" first suggested the viticulture collaboration to the Juve goalkeeper through his agent Silvano Martina. READ: Italian team's crest represents the future of footballREAD: Juventus claim fifth straight Serie A title\"Knowing about Gigi's passion for wines, I pitched him the idea of Buffon having his own line of wines,\" Cordella told CNN Sport. \"Within 24 hours, I was in Turin to close the deal.\"'Refined palate'Cordella describes Buffon as \"a big expert of wine\" and having a \"refined palate.\" By the sound of it, according to Cordella, the Juve keeper is also a bit of a perfectionist.\"He expects the best, but he is also very critical with himself, a feature that surely comes from years at the top level in football,\" said Cordella.Buffon's illustrious career started at Parma 22 years ago. Moving to Juventus, he won practically everything -- including seven Serie A titles -- and with Italy the crowning achievement of his career came with the 2006 World Cup win. The only significant trophy missing from his impressive cabinet is the Champions League. Having lost finals against Barcelona in 2015 and AC Milan in 2003, Buffon has another shot June 3 when Juve plays Real in Cardiff's Millennium Stadium.Gianluigi Buffon will appear in his third Champions League final next month.Football and wine -- the perfect marriage? Buffon currently makes three different lines of wine, under the name \"Buffon #1.\"He is keeping the production limited to 90,000 bottles per year with 30,000 each of red, white and rose, while also producing 30,000 bottles of olive oil per year. The price of the wines range from $22 to $33.All the grapes used by Buffon for his wine are local to Apulia and, Cordella assures, \"of top quality.\" The red wine will be of the Primitivo variety, one of the finest in the region, while the white will consist of imported Chardonnay grapes.For Cordella, a career in football and wine-making has enabled him to indulge his two passions. \"I was always involved in football. It has always interested me since my studies in business management,\" he says. \"My first job as a sporting director was at Africa Sport Abidjan in Ivory Coast, where I won two league titles with former Inter Milan and Italy player Francesco Moriero.\"READ: How Monaco toppled PSG to win Ligue 1 titleREAD: How tart cherry juice helped fuel Monaco successREAD: Eight foods to improve athletic performanceBuffon is not the only footballer with his own line in wine.

He has created what he calls a \"selection of champions\" -- a group of footballers dedicated to wine-making, including, along with Buffon, Dutch captain Wesley Sneijder and former Inter Milan and Chile star Ivan Zamorano.\"These wines are created ad hoc for every single player,\" explains Cordella. \"I'm not just putting their name on the label, it's a project they actually take care of from the beginning to the end.\"Naturally it's a business, both for me and for them. But it's a serious business that is proving to be rewarding, both for me and for the footballers. \"They are basically given a second life, which can become as exciting and satisfying as their first one.\"'Second life'Italian footballers are renowned for playing to a ripe old age given many players' careers wind down in their early 30s. While Buffon is approaching his 40s, the 40-year-old Francesco Totti -- the oldest goalscorer in Champions League history --  is playing in his final season for Roma in Serie A and former Italy and AC Milan captain Paolo Maldini retired when he was 41. So in Buffon's case, it's not quite time to throw himself entirely at this \"second life\" especially as the goalkeeper has unfinished business to attend to and a Champions League title to win.Visit cnn.com/tennis for more news and videosVictory for Juventus next month would be the perfect way to toast a remarkable career.",

In driving rain whipped by an onshore wind from the North Sea, the local Labour member of Parliament, Anna Turley, is knocking on voters' doors as she fights to keep her seat in next month's general election. The disaffection with Westminster politics is palpable. Redcar, in the industrial northeast of England, should be safe Labour territory: its voters are, like many in the region, working class and have relied upon steel and other heavy industry for work.The borough of Redcar and Cleveland voted to leave the European Union by 66%. But the community has been knocked off its feet by globalization. Two years ago, its steelworks -- the main source of income for many in the town -- closed with the loss of 3,000 jobs, a victim of falling steel prices worldwide spurred by cheap imports from China. Left behind by the world, Redcar took its chance to fight back: 66% here voted for Britain to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum, far higher than the national average of 52%.Read MoreREAD MORE: Happy in Hull? Why this British town backed BrexitAnd last month the region delivered a huge upset electing a mayor from the Conservative Party. In the general election on June 8, in the same way that Democrats in the steel towns of Pennsylvania voted for Donald Trump, Redcar could elect a Conservative MP -- a first in the 40-year history of the constituency.New fault linesIn this seat -- and across the UK -- Brexit has carved new fault lines in British politics. Old tribal loyalties of left and right, Labour and Conservative, have broken down. As they prepare to go to the ballot box, voters are going through something of an identity crisis.And it is not just Brexit that is shaking up political affiliations: Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative manifesto, which launched on Thursday, appeals directly to Labour's core supporters.British Prime Minister Theresa May speaks to employees at a ScrewFix distribution centre on May 16, 2017 in Stoke On Trent, United Kingdom.Echoing the US president, the Prime Minister has railed against free trade and the global elite, whom she calls the \"citizens of nowhere\". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's manifesto is far to the left of the centrist agenda of Tony Blair, a man seen as the CEO of the global elite.READ MORE: Can left-wing populism win the UK election?In the village of Marske on the outskirts of Redcar, Pat Hamilton, a 70-year-old retired care assistant, says she has voted Labour all her life but now isn't sure who she will support. Her nephew was among 3,000 people who lost their jobs when the steelworks, owned by SSI UK, closed in 2015. There was anger locally when the Conservative government, led by David Cameron, failed to rescue the plant.  \"Now they are importing steel from abroad,\" Hamilton says. \"The Government doesn't think we are important enough.\" Labour's tough battleDespite the Conservatives' failure to save the steelworks, MP Anna Turley is facing a tough battle for votes for Labour, the UK's main opposition party. It is almost as if the joy of Brexit, a power handed to these voters by a Conservative government, trumps the anger over the closure of the steelworks.Turley tells me later: \"People round here feel that no-one cares. They have seen decades of industrial decline and jobs have just not been replaced. They spoke out angrily in the referendum last year, feeling that they wanted people to put them first for once.READ MORE: The 'forgotten tribe' in West Virginia; why America's white working class feels left behind\"Warnings of a dire impact on the local industry of manufacturing meant nothing to people who told me they had nothing to lose anyway. The Tories (Conservatives) closed the steelworks, took 3,000 jobs and blamed the EU. It's no wonder people feel that the current political and economic system is not working for them.\"It is only Labour as the party of the working class that can articulate their views and stand up for them -- we owe it to them to make sure we are doing that.\"A file photo of Labour MP for Redcar Anna Turley in front of the SSI steel blast furnace site on September 24, 2015 in Redcar, England. But there is something else at play here: on the doorstep, Redcar resident Hamilton tells Turley she might not vote Labour because of its leader. Last summer, buffeted by poor poll ratings and criticized for his far-left agenda, Corbyn faced an attempt to unseat him by his own MPs. The coup failed, but his poll ratings have failed to recover.\"I just don't think he is any good,\" says Hamilton. \"I just don't think he is strong enough.\" Turley stays on the doorstep to talk her constituent round to voting Labour, but there are many more who express doubts.Eileen Leonard, 79, will be giving up her lifelong habit of voting Labour. \"I can remember when the lights went out in the 1970s,\" she says, referring to a time beset by unemployment and labor strikes under a previous Labour government. \"It was serious, all the time. They brought the country to its knees. Marxism didn't work. I don't want Corbyn leading the country.\"It used to be that your parents would say you must vote Labour but that no longer applies.Christopher ReillySmoking a cigarette outside The Standard pub in Redcar town center, Christopher Reilly, 50, a head chef, points to Corbyn's failure to sing the national anthem at a World War II remembrance service and his perceived antipathy to NATO as reasons why traditional working-class voters are switching sides -- some to the anti-EU UK Independence Party but many straight to the Conservatives.\"The bond that working class people had with Labour has been broken,\" he said. \"It used to be that your parents would say you must vote Labour but that no longer applies.\"Brexit's roots run deepBut it would be wrong to say this working-class disaffection started under Corbyn.Deborah Mattinson, the founder of research and strategy firm Britain Thinks, says the drift away from the party started under former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair and continued under his successors Gordon Brown and Labour Party leader Ed Miliband: \"Now Corbyn is the cherry on the cake,\" she says.\"Most ordinary people are less tribal than many journalists and Westminster insiders claim them to be. Most people don't see themselves on a left-right spectrum or having particular loyalty to a particular party, even though they have tended to vote for that party. People more likely to define themselves by what they are not,\" she told CNN. Leader of the Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn addresses the crowd at a campaign rally after launching the Labour Party Election Manifesto on May 16, 2017 in Huddersfield, England.Mattinson says that her focus groups suggest that voters are confused by where Labour stands on Brexit and other issues.While Brexit could be a factor in seats like Redcar, in other areas it is less important than jobs and the economy. One focus group that Britain Thinks held in Harrow West, where the Labour incumbent has a narrow 2,208-vote majority over the Conservatives, found that even those who voted to remain in the EU are resigned to leaving -- as Mattinson explained, they feel that \"Brexit is done and dusted -- let's move on\".READ MORE: Brexit: What happens after Article 50? Across the UK, two thirds of voters are either happy with or have accepted Brexit: a poll by YouGov last week indicated 45% identified as \"Hard Leavers\", those who voted for Brexit and still want out, while 23% were \"Re-Leavers\" who voted Remain but are resigned to Brexit -- a total acceptance level of 68%.This helps explain why, in a handful of urban seats in affluent areas in and around London, the Liberal Democrats -- who are battling to be reinstated as the third party of British politics by clearly defining themselves as the anti-Brexit party -- cannot count on remain voters to hand them seats in Parliament.With tribal loyalties cast aside and emotional bonds broken, the UK election will come down to who is seen as most capable of leading the country through an uncertain time. It is no wonder that the Prime Minister is pitching herself as the leader of \"Theresa May's Team\", and of the country, rather than the \"Conservatives\", and points to her securing a convincing victory on June 8.",

Superstars of the grime scene such as JME, Stormzy and Akala as well as young MCs Novelist, Big Zuu and AJ Tracey have all tweeted, instagrammed or snapped their support for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, in the run-up to the UK's general electionCorbyn, a left-wing politician who has been a Labour MP in London since 1983, was elected leader of the party in 2015. Many Labour MPs have been critical of his leadership, his socialist policies and his pacifist stance. But grime artists are now speaking out in support of the politician, and urging their fans to vote for his party on June 8.\"For the first time in my adult life there is a chance to elect someone I would consider a sane and decent human,\" wrote rapper and poet Akala on Twitter soon after the snap election was announced in April. But for the first time in my adult life there is a chance to elect someone I would consider a sane and decent human...\u2014 Akala (@akalamusic) April 21, 2017\n\nRead More\"He has constantly voted/spoken against UK foreign aggression,\" he wrote. \"This alone makes him the most electable politician we have ever had,\" he added, also praising Corbyn's anti-austerity, pro-National Health Service stance.There's now a hashtag -- #Grime4Corbyn -- and a website that encourages users to register to vote before the May 22 deadline. Jeremy Corbyn addresses the crowd at a campaign rally on May 16, 2017 in Huddersfield, England. The website also links to a grime track, the lyrics for which are taken from a speech given by Corbyn in September 2016 after he won a second Labour leadership election.\"If like me, you believe that it's a scandal that here in Britain, the sixth largest economy in the world,\" the track starts, \"four million children are in poverty, six million workers are paid less than the living wage; and if like me, you believe we can do things far better, then help us build support for a genuine alternative that would invest in our future. \"A more prosperous future, in which the wealth we all create is shared more equally.\"Earlier this week, JME, co-founder of grime collective and record label Boy Better Know (BBK), revealed via Snapchat that he and Corbyn had met and spoken about politics and the need for young people to vote in the election.I met @jeremycorbyn today, and explained why bare of us don't vote. I forgot to ask for a pic, so here's one I borrowed \ud83d\udcf8 pic.twitter.com/9X62jU8pQg\u2014 Jme (@JmeBBK) May 14, 2017\n\n\"I've never voted before. Ever!\" said JME. Lots of young people think that \"no one has our best interests at heart,\" he said.\"Now, we seem to be seeing someone that we can actually trust, someone that's human.\"For a short time after this, the BBK Wikipedia page showed Corbyn in the collective's list of members and the Labour Manifesto in the 'discography' section. Lee Barron, lecturer at the University of Northumbria, thinks the explosion of support for Corbyn among grime artists and fans makes a lot of sense. \"Grime is very much about urban experience,\" he told CNN. \"It emerged from economically marginalized areas where there are lots of working-class voters. It's logical that this kind of street music would be more aligned with a Labour attitude, and particularly with Corbyn's impassioned principles.\"Snapchat gets political: Filter urges UK users to register to voteBut while grime music has always been political, Barron explains, until now this has largely taken the form of general criticism of politics.The support for \"a very specific figure is something which is new,\" Barron says. Michael Kyriacou, 25, a grime fan and PhD student in political theory, agrees. \"When it comes to the articulation of politics and grime, the lyric that is often parroted is Skepta Shutdown's 'We don't listen to no politician. Everybody on the same mission. We don't care about your -isms and schisms.' I think with the Grime4Corbyn movement we are seeing this being overturned,\" he says.\"By being reached out to by major artists like JME and Stormzy he's managing to cultivate a clear appeal. This is due to Corbyn being seen as someone with integrity and conviction as well as offering policies which seek to ameliorate the conditions imposed by Conservative austerity. \"It's the convergence of personality and policy in Corbyn that enables him to make political headway in areas previously off limits to mainstream politics.\"And the hashtag is clearly catching on. Twitter user Craig tweeted on May 16, \"Jeremy Corbyn went from a lad who I didn't care about to my favorite politician in the space of a week #grime4corbyn is an excellent idea.\"Jeremy Corbyn went from a lad who I didn't care about to my favourite politician in the space of a week #grime4corbyn is an excellent idea\u2014 \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 \u2606\ud83e\udd18Craig\ud83d\udd25\u2606\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa (@Iconic_AntiHero) May 16, 2017\n\nAgatka, 34, from London, has also used the hashtag. \"I love that grime artists are getting more political,\" she told CNN. \"I only wish it started louder and earlier. Many of the struggles so many grime artists rap about are a direct result of choices our MPs made.\"And it's Conservative MPs that she blames the most. \"The policies of the Tories punish the most vulnerable and breed inequality,\" she said.But is there a danger that fans could be turned off by the politics that now dominates some of their idols' Twitter and Instagram feeds? Barron doesn't think so. \"There is a wider cynicism about politicized celebrities,\" he said. \"In the 1990s, we saw pop artists allied with particular politicians, for example.\"But grime is much more spontaneous than that and much more authentic ... It's about life as it's lived. And with Corbyn, they see someone who relates to that. It's a return to a more classic Labour position.\"",

A keen sportswoman growing up, rowing was her first sporting foray of note at a time when her parents were divorcing.\"I used to row a lot when I was younger,\" she recalls of her teenage self. \"I was in the single scull and double scull and part of it was making the weight category. My parents went through a divorce at the time and I lost contact with my Dad.\"I had no control over my life. It was all so wrong and I was angry inside, and the only thing I could control was to not eat.\"It is something, she says, that remains with her and, if her mood slips or there is sadness in her life, she stops eating.But it is a condition she now has a grip on, having struggled with it for a solid 18 months.\"I remember my Mum seeing me in the bath and saying how skinny I was, and I knew she was right,\" she adds.\"I knew I needed help.

I don't know who he was or his name but he changed me and my career. Hopefully my voice can make a change in just one person.\"For as long as she could remember, Fisher wanted to be an elite sportswoman. The doctor's words transformed her life and allowed her to go on and succeed in various sports. First, from 2006 to 2009, in the British bobsleigh set-up, where she was second in the national trials in 2008 and then sixth in the junior world championships.But the lure of rugby was strong -- a sport she had played before bobsleigh. She was part of the squad which won the 2014 Rugby World Cup and remains a regular on the World Cup Sevens circuit.Rio was supposed to be the high but, following a semifinal defeat by New Zealand and missing out on bronze to Canada, she has struggled in the intervening months.At the time, she wrote a heartfelt message on social media of her Olympic journey, from the anorexia and alopecia to, more recently, injury setbacks. Even now, she has not fully come to terms with it.\"I'm still in that post-Rio dip,\" she confesses. \"The result was what it was and I came away thinking 'is this it?' with everything that went into it.

The aim is to reach young voters, who are statistically much less likely to be registered than older voters and less likely to turn out on polling day.The bespoke filter is the result of a collaboration between Snapchat and the UK Electoral Commission, which runs campaigns before every major poll to encourage voter registration.The new Snapchat filter encourages UK users to register to vote in the general election. \"This is a new way of engaging young voters,\" an Electoral Commission spokesperson told CNN. \"We haven't done this before. We're thinking about where our audiences are and how we can engage with them.Read More\"Young people might not be reading newspapers or watching the news,\" she said. \"But they are on Snapchat.\"Some might not know the deadline is coming up or they might assume they're already registered.\"Bite the Ballot, which tries to empower young citizens to be more involved in politics, approves of the initiative. Can left-wing populism win the UK election?\"This shouldn't be seen as just a gimmick,\" said the organization's Josh Dell. \"It's a very effective way of making people aware of the need to get registered.\"The impact of this can only be positive.\"Chelsea Dalby, 23, one Snapchat user from Sunderland in northeast England, has more mixed feelings. \"I don't think it would encourage people to vote but it's probably going to make people more aware of the election,\" she said.Another user, Emily Pentland, 23, who lives in Durham, also thinks the filter will raise awareness although education is needed to engage young people with politics.\"I think politics awareness should be encouraged in schools from a young age,\" she said, \"because a lot of people our age don't really understand politics and the impact it will have on our future.\"Where Donald Trump got his real powerThe latest available Electoral Commission data (from December 2015) shows that 34% of 18 to 24-year-olds are not registered to vote, compared with just 4% of over-65s.  Both the EU referendum in June 2016 and the Prime Minister's announcement of a snap election a few weeks ago generated big spikes in registrations, particularly among young people.But many may still be missing from the register.\"Anyone who is eligible to vote at the General Election should be able to take part,\" said Craig Westwood, Director of Communications at the Electoral Commision, in a statement. \"However, if you're not registered to vote by the deadline of 22 May, then you won't be able to have your say. We're urging anyone not yet registered to do so as soon as possible.\"The Commission is also working with other social media platforms to encourage people to get signed up.Earlier this month, posts reminding people to register appeared in the Facebook newsfeeds of UK users. Registration reminders will also appear on Instagram in the days before the deadline.",

From a singular financial model to a cutting-edge kitchen, CNN Sport looks at the reasons behind the club's success.A new modelWhen AS Monaco spent upwards of $160 million on players in a single transfer window four years ago, it appeared French and European football had a new powerhouse in town.Read MoreThe small principality had only just been promoted to Ligue 1, but utilized a prince's influence and apparently boundless riches provided by billionaire Russian businessman Dmitry Rybolovlev to secure the signatures of world class talent, from James Rodriguez to Radamel Falcao. A second place finish followed, as fans reveled in a long-awaited challenger to the Qatari wealth of PSG. But perceiving the unsustainability of such a transfer policy, Monaco abandoned its lavish spending as abruptly as it had begun, and one by one the new breed of \"Galaticos\" departed.  PSG, meanwhile, continued to lure some of the world's best players to the capital, utterly dominating French football and wrapping up last season's Ligue 1 title by early March.Over 30 points clear of the nearest challengers in 2015/16, PSG's star-studded squad might have expected to look down on little Monaco once again this season.How wrong they were.  In an era of super agents and $100 million players, vice president and CEO Vadim Vasilyev has bucked football's trend of spending big. And in a game where a leading British pundit once said \"you can't win anything with kids,\" Monaco sits atop the French league with one of European football's youngest starting lineups.\"In the beginning we needed massive investment to convince top players to come, otherwise it would have taken years,\" Vasilyev told CNN Sport in April.However with a population of just under 40,000 and a stadium capacity of 18,523, the former Russian diplomat quickly realized that model was untenable long-term.\"We understand our advantages and we understand our handicaps,\" he shrugged, explaining limited revenues meant Monaco had to change tack and adopt a new policy.Vasilyev calls it step two: \"developing young players and letting them go when the time is right.\"A new generationVadim Vasilyev (C) is pictured with Djibril Sidibe, Corentin Jean, Benjamin Mendy, Morgan de Sanctis and Kamil Glik in August 2016.Since eschewing the big-spending of 2013/14, Monaco's methods have actually yielded $87 million in net transfer profit. PSG's accounts show a $192 million net loss on transfers in the same period, but it is arguably Jardim that boasts the more exciting squad at his disposal.The club's academy, La Turbie, has blossomed under the stewardship of director Betrand Reuzeau, and the conveyor belt keeps running.Those supporters old enough to remember the rapid development of Monaco youth team alumni Lilian Thuram, Emmanuel Petit and Thierry Henry -- World Cup winners in 1998 -- could be forgiven for feeling a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.Today, a new generation ably supports more experienced teammates, stepping out from the shadows to thrill football fans across Europe.Chief among them is the mercurial Mbapp\u00e9 -- an 18-year-old with 26 goals and 14 assists to his name in just 2,570 minutes this season.He's shown so much promise that Monaco officials have reportedly slapped a $168 million price tag to ward off potential suitors.In all competitions the teenager is directly contributing to a Monaco goal every 63 minutes. They're numbers to rival not just a teenage Lionel Messi, but the Messi of today.Kylian Mbappe has scored or assisted every 63.9 minutes in all competitions for Monaco this season -- a record comparable to Lionel Messi (61.9) and better than Cristiano Ronaldo (78.8)\nA fearless dribbler with rare composure, Mbapp\u00e9 is the youngest player to reach 15 league goals in Europe's top five leagues since former Ballon d'Or winner Michael Owen achieved the feat in 1998, and the only player to score in his opening four Champions League knockout games.His goal against Juventus in the Champions League semifinal may have proven little more than a consolation, but Mbappe had beaten a goalkeeper 7,621 days his senior that could conceivably have been his father. JUST WATCHEDMonaco star Silva plots new challengeReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMonaco star Silva plots new challenge 01:55Bernardo Silva, 22, is another talent attracting envious glances from Europe's top clubs.The Portuguese international says he was intimidated when he first took to the training field alongside the likes of Dimitar Berbatov, Ricardo Carvalho and Jo\u00e3o Moutinho, admitting he was \"a little shocked\" to play with such \"amazing players.\" But Silva has quickly cemented his place in the Monaco starting eleven, benefiting from Monaco's unique blend of youth and experience. \"It was here that I learned most of the things that I know about football,\" he told CNN Sport. \"To play with the big players with intensity, with strength.\"I learned that it's not only the technique; you have to be very, very strong, and be concentrated for the full 90 minutes.\"The diminutive attacking midfielder has come to the fore at key moments this season -- capped by a \"special\" extra-time equalizer against PSG in January. Only Marseille's Morgan Sanson has made more league assists, and it was no surprise to see Silva named in the Ligue 1 team of the season -- alongside teammates Danijel Suba\u0161i\u0107, Djibril Sidib\u00e9, Kamil Glik, Benjamin Mendy and Mbapp\u00e9.Can Monaco keep hold of Silva?

I didn't let a moment pass without gaining something for my life \u2014 Radamel Falcao\"Everything in life is a lesson and one can take advantage of this if they can find something in every situation,\" he told CNN Sport on the Monaco training field.Why a prince was the secret weapon in signing Radamel Falcao\"These type of adverse experiences teach you and I tried to learn; to assimilate as much as possible; and to put into practice as much as possible.\"For me, it was like this: I didn't let that moment pass without gaining something for my life.\"After that torrid spell in the Premier League, during which the Colombian was hampered by injury and even jeered by supporters, there's little doubt El Tigre is roaring once again. \"It was only a question of getting confidence back and feeling like an important part of the team,\" he asserted, finally approaching the form that saw him score 142 goals in 178 appearances during his stints at FC Porto and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid.\"This club have always been behind me, supporting me.

So much so that over the weekend he set a world record for the fastest shed on sand -- it reached a speed of 78.965 miles per hour.But he didn't just drive the shed -- he also designed and built it.\"What a wonderful experience -- it's nature's race track,\" the 52-year-old told CNN Tuesday of what it felt like to race across Pendine Sands in South Wales at the Straightliners speed record event.Read More\"It's where Malcolm Campbell did 174.883 mph to set the land-speed record in 1927 and there I was 90 years later.\"Sheds don't come faster than this ...It took Nicks seven months to build the shed, which weighs over two tonnes, and then over four months to persuade the authorities to allow the vehicle on the road.With its own number plate, Nicks says it's the world's only road-legal shed.As part of the process of getting it on the road, former UK Prime Minister David Cameron, who is Nicks' MP, wrote to the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency on his behalf.That process involved a six-hour inspection and Nicks having to master 299 pages of rules.  \"It's not your average shed,\" he says matter of factly, estimating that the vehicle cost him just over $7,000 to build, not forgetting the countless hours of perspiration and perseverance.\"It's got full electric windows and remote central locking.

I am a right-wing man, you will not be surprised. Yet, we do respect each other and both know as you do that the general interest has to come first.\"The choice of Philippe -- widely predicted by political pundits -- indicates Macron's desire to draw support from the conservative opposition and create balance, according to Emmanuelle Sch\u00f6n-Quinlivan, lecturer in European politics at University College, Cork, in Ireland.Read MoreStrong mandate sought\"Macron needs to retilt the people around him to the right as at the moment the main people around him are from the left.

His party, En Marche!, is scrambling to get 577 candidates together to contest every seat in the country. Emmanuel Macron: From political novice to president Although he won the May 7 election against National Front candidate Marine Le Pen with 66% of the vote, his party was only founded last year and has never held a single National Assembly seat.  Macron needs to win a majority in the June vote to have the mandate to push his legislative agenda through.If he manages to achieve that, the Prime Minister's role will be to see through the promised reforms to address unemployment in France and boost the ailing economy.Not a high profile politicianPhilippe, a lawyer with experience working in the private sector, was born in Rouen and grew up in a left-wing environment.

We should give the best of our politics to our country. We should call for appeasement and for the gathering of our political forces.\"But Le Pen said: \"This is the sacred alliance of the old left and right wings that are united in their will to maintain at any cost the same austerity policies, the same submission to Brussels, the same massive immigration and the same laxity, that have already harmed France very badly.\"PM and President are friendsAlthough the new PM has not been a high-profile politician in France, his appointment was no surprise to politics watchers.\"Although he had suggested that he wanted a woman, everyone expected Edouard Philippe,\" Sch\u00f6n-Quinlivan said. \"Macron needs a Prime Minister who could deal with the parliament, and knows the ins and outs of how it works.\"JUST WATCHEDMacron faces challenges in parliamentary voteReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMacron faces challenges in parliamentary vote 02:38The President and his new PM are  friends, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV, having met regularly since they first got to know each other at a dinner in 2011.

At 39, he becomes the youngest president in France's history, and the youngest leader since Napoleon. The new President vowed to bring confidence back to a nation that has been \"broken\" by a spate of terror attacks and a sluggish economy. He said he hoped to restore French values and applauded voters for resisting the wave of populism in choosing him over his rival, far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, in his landslide victory a week ago.Read More\"The world and Europe needs France more than ever. They need a strong France that is sure of its destiny. A France that upholds freedom and solidarity,\" he said. \"I am convinced that the power of France is not in decline, as we are at the dawn of an extraordinary rebirth.\" Emmanuel Macron with his wife, Brigitte Trogneux, at the inauguration on Sunday.He listed a range of challenges facing the country, from migration fluxes, to the \"excesses\" of global capitalism and terrorism. \"Nothing will affect only a part of the population. We are united, we are all neighbors.\"Eying legislative voteMacron has promised to breathe new life into French politics, and in his speech Sunday, he laid out a vision of a vibrant economy boosted by innovation and technology, and an openness to the world. France: Half of Macron's legislative election candidates are womenBut to some skeptical onlookers, Macron is still something of an unknown quantity. He has little experience in governance, serving as economy minister for two years as his most senior role.Just a week since his win, Macron has inherited an extraordinary to-do list and some demanding deadlines. He is expected to name his prime minister on Monday and a full Cabinet by Wednesday. Macron has said he is looking at one male and one female candidate for prime minister, but gave little clue as to who they might be.He will also now be looking to the June legislative elections. His centrist La Republique En Marche! party, which has never held a single seat in parliament, will need a strong parliamentary presence to push Macron's legislative agenda through.Emmanuel Macron's tricky to-do list after French election The party is scrambling to get 577 candidates together to contest every seat in the country ahead of vote, on June 11 and 18.It named 428 candidates on Thursday, half of them women and more than half from outside the political establishment, fulfilling a party pledge made in January. Of the established politicians, the party has attracted candidates from both the left and right, causing panic among traditional parties facing mass defections.Macron won the May 7 election with a resounding 66% of the vote, but his mandate may not be as strong as those numbers suggest. Many in France made it clear that they were casting their votes against Le Pen, rather than for Macron.Bidding farewell to HollandeMacron's inauguration ceremony was steeped in French ritual and tradition. He arrived at the Elysee Palace Sunday morning and walked down a long red carpet, where he was greeted by outgoing  President Francois Hollande.The two men shook hands between the French and European Union (EU) flags, a reminder of France's prominent role in the 28-member bloc and Macron's commitment to the EU. In accordance with tradition, Macron escorted Hollande to his car. Hollande was driven away in a modest Citroen hatchback, leaving behind the leadership of a country battered by several deadly terror attacks and an economy that failed to pick up under his watch.Emmanuel Macron shows his predessor, Francois Hollande, to his car at the Elysee Palace on Sunday. Hollande decided not to run for a second term. His popularity, and that of his Socialist Party, plunged after the Paris attacks in November 2015, in which 130 people were killed.Hollande sent a flurry of emotional tweets as he left the palace, defending his leadership in a time of national hardship. \"I ensured that our country stood firm in these circumstances.

The winning song, \"Amar Pelos Dois\" (\"For The Both Of Us\") was written by Sobral's sister, Luisa.Sobral's win delighted fans gathered in the Ukrainian capital for Saturday's grand final, in which 26 acts took to the stage in a riot of costume and glitter.When the judges announced the points for second place Bulgarian singer Kristian Kostov, and the teenager failed to get anough to overtake his Portuguese competitor, it slowly sunk in for Sobral that he had won.\"I thought this was crazy,\" he told reporters later.The Sobrals' ballad, set to a jazz-like piano and soothing stringed instruments, gave Portugal its first win in the 61-year-old contest.Read More\"If I can help to bring some change to music I will be really joyful.

She also had filled in during some rehearsals for the finals because of her brother's serious health issues.She said: \"Our ears sometimes are so overwhelmed with everything that is happening (in music) that when someone comes and sings something very simple and very straight to you heart, it works 10 times more.\"The Portugese singer won both the most points awarded by judges from each country in the contest and from residents of the nations taking part. He finished with 758 points, well clear of Kostov and the Moldovan entry, the Sunstroke Project.\"As long as people love me I will keep on doing music,\" Kostov, 17, said, according to a video posted on the competition's YouTube channel. He complimented the winner, saying, \"He deserves (the) best. He was really good. ... He's doing nothing but he's doing everything.\"Croatia's Jacques Houdek said he knew in his heart Sobral would win.\"I think it's a very beautiful song. ... It's very fado (a Portugese genre known for being plaintive). It's full of love. It's different,\" Houdek said. This year the contest included people wearing a gorilla suit, a costume horse head, and a lighted full-face mask.The song competition features singers from the 43 countries that make up the European Broadcasting Union (EBU.) This year's finalists were whittled down from a total of 42 entries through semifinals held Tuesday and Thursday. Eurovision's glitzy pageant jars with pain of Ukraine conflictAlthough the contest is supposed to be nonpolitical, this year's Eurovision saw its share of controversy. Russia should have been the 43rd entrant in the show, but pulled out last month amid a row over its chosen singer, Julia Samoylova.Ukraine banned Samoylova from traveling to the capital of Kiev after allegations emerged she illegally entered Crimea to perform in 2015. Ukranian law requires visitors to enter and exit Crimea -- annexed by Russia in 2014 -- with a special government permission since 2015, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine.Eurovision organizers condemned Ukraine's decision to ban Samoylova but said Russian could instead take part in the competition via satellite or simply choose a different contestant who could legally travel to Ukraine.However, Channel One, Russia's TV network, rejected both options and announced it would not broadcast this year's competition.  Russian viewers were not able to vote in the contest either.Eurovision Song Contest winner 2016 Jamala, representing Ukraine, is seen on stage with her award.After Ukraine won in Sweden in 2016, with a song that was controversial in its own right, there were concerns that the security situation in the country's east -- where the Ukrainian military is fighting Russia-backed separatists -- might rule out holding the next contest in Kiev.But Ukraine was determined to host as expected and organizers announced earlier this month that all the tickets for the grand final had sold out. Heavy security is in place in Kiev for the event in the city's International Exhibition Center. One dignitary, however, wasn't present. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko canceled his visit to the final after deadly shelling in the east of the country Saturday, according to his official Facebook account. Four civilians were killed and one seriously wounded by shelling in the town of Avdiivka on Saturday evening, the country's Anti-Terrorist Operation press center said.Some have remarked that the Eurovision Village, where visiting fans gathered to watch the shows live on big screens, is in central Khreshchatyk Street and Independence Square, scene of bloody protests little more than three years ago.But the contest's many fans, some so dedicated that they travel each year to the host city, were ready for the big finale.The wait is over!

Songs must be performed live, be no longer than three minutes and can be sung in any language.Viewers of participating broadcasters can vote for their favorite song but not for their own country. The votes can be cast via telephone, SMS or using the official app. There is also a jury of professionals in each nation to award points.Block voting, nationalism and a settling of old scores have long been accusations when it comes to Eurovision. For many viewers, watching the votes come in as expected from certain nations just adds to the fun.US viewers were able to watch the grand final streamed live via Logo, but were not allowed to cast votes.What you need to knowThe first Eurovision contest was held in 1956, when just seven countries took part. That six-decade run makes it one of the longest-running TV shows in the world. Last year, 204 million people watched at least some part of the contest from around the world.Six countries are always guaranteed a spot in the final -- the host nation and France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom, because they pay the most money toward the cost of the competition. Since 2015, Australia has been among the contestants. Other non-European entrants include Israel and Azerbaijan.By the time the curtain fell on the 2017 contest, 1,479 songs in total were performed, according to Eurovision.Ireland has done best over the decades, winning seven times. Sweden has won the contest six times, while Luxembourg, France and the United Kingdom have won five times.Victory comes at a cost, however. The winning nation must host the contest the following year, which doesn't come cheap.CNN's Victoria Butenko in Kiev contributed to this report.",

She famously went from being Macron's teacher to his partner, and eventually his wife. Now she is France's next first lady.Are we sexist for gawking at Macron's marriage?

Emmanuel Macron's marriage proves politics is different in France\"I often say that if the age relationship were to be inverted, it wouldn't shock anybody, people would find it great,\" he said.\"She is beautiful, and the fact that she's 20 years older than I am is terrible, because it is an issue of mockery, of terrible discourtesy. I give in to nothing, but it has taught us a lot, including in politics. We never build ourselves in relation to others' gaze.\"Macron and Trogneux have been determined to ensure that their relationship, while unconventional, is not painted as some sort of scandal, making a point of making it public and posing for glossy French magazines.'Love took everything in its path'Before she met Macron, Trogneux was on the path to living a relatively conventional life.

It was impossible to resist him,\" Trogneux told Paris Match magazine in 2016.  She divorced Auzi\u00e8re in 2006 and married Macron a year later, moving to Paris to work as a teacher. In 2015, she gave up her career to focus on her husband, who was at the time the country's economy minister. Journalist Pierre-Eliott Buet and CNN's Angela Dewan contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Story highlightsUFC president Dana White upbeat on Mayweather McGregor clashBoxer Mayweather has called on Irish UFC star to make it happenFight could net Mayweather $100m & McGregor $75m (CNN)The president of UFC is \"pretty confident\" the mega fight between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Conor McGregor will become a reality.Dana White has told CNN he'll strive to make the crossover bout happen, and delight mixed martial arts and boxing fans alike, even though it would make \"zero cents\" for his business.Irishman Conor McGregor has quickly become Ultimate Fighting Championship's biggest drawEven for an industry which prides itself on selling its own wares expertly, the speculation machine has gone into overdrive regarding the prospect of UFC's biggest draw, McGregor, switching codes in an attempt to inflict the first ever professional defeat of Mayweather's storied boxing career. For his own part, Mayweather, who proudly boasts a 49-0 record, has supposedly retired. But the lure of a rumored payday in excess of $100m -- with McGregor reportedly in line for approximately $75m -- is making the bout likelier to happen, rather than wither on the boxing vine like so many prospective fights.WATCH: Tale a guided tour of UFC's headquartersRead MoreAnd from White's perspective, despite UFC isn't set to benefit financially from the contest, the fact the Irishman has \"done a lot of big things for this company\" is another reason \"I will do the Mayweather-McGregor fight, because I think he deserves it.\" Floyd Mayweather retired after his 49th straight victory, over Andre Berto in September 2015But the feeling persists that if the UFC megastar is embarrassed by Mayweather inside the boxing ring, it could do real damage to White's product -- not to mention the literal and metaphorical pain inflicted on McGregor's body and ego. \"If you look at this thing, McGregor will walk into boxing, a completely different sport than what we do here,\" White explained in an interview with CNN at his company's new headquarters in Las Vegas. \"If this was a mixed martial art fight against Floyd Mayweather it would last 15 seconds. Floyd wouldn't last 15 seconds with Conor McGregor. \"Conor McGregor will last more than 15 seconds with Floyd Mayweather. Conor McGregor will make a fight of it. He's going into a completely different sport and he's willing to do it and people want to see it so we'll give it a shot.\"READ: The fight club where Conor McGregor isn't welcomeMcGregor celebrates his KO victory over Eddie Alvarez in UFC 205 at Madison Square GardenThere remains much work to be done on the negotiating front before Mayweather vs. McGregor becomes a reality, just this weekend a supposed date for the bout was taken for the Canelo Alvarez and Gennady Golovkin fight.But in White's own words: \"I'm pretty confident that we could probably get it done.\"The always ebullient White revealed that when it comes to communicating with his sport's superstar, their method of discourse might not be the most obvious: direct messages on Twitter. Dee and Junior are doing great everyone! Thank you for all the kind words, I am one proud and blessed Daddy \u2764\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/3JqMpLvs9d\u2014 Conor McGregor (@TheNotoriousMMA) May 7, 2017\n\"Conor and I have always dealt very well with each other,\" White noted. \"We DM each other through Twitter, that's how we communicate. I call him the unicorn. He's a very unique individual. There will never be another Conor McGregor. There will be another star but there will never be another Conor McGregor.\"READ: McGregor gets naked for world's richest horse raceYet even White's patience has been tried by his most challenging of athletes when it comes to the area of timekeeping. \"I can sit here all day and compliment Conor McGregor on a million different things,\" White says, with a smile on his face. \"His willingness to show up on time to media events is the one thing that drives me crazy about Conor McGregor. I don't accept it. \"I do the best I can to let him know that I'm not happy about it and that he needs to show up on time for these things.\"If the richest fight in boxing history does get signed, it's a sure bet that McGregor won't be late for the opening bell.McGregor lost to Nate Diaz at UFC 196 but had his revenge by winning the rematch at UFC 202Is Rousey finished?Meanwhile, White told CNN Ronda Rousey will never fight again in the Ultimate Fighting Championship. And while that's an opinion that has been doing the rounds ever since her crushing back-to-back defeats over the past 18 months, the words carry extra weight when they come from the mouth of the sport's figurehead.He was adamant the 30-year-old Rousey, who has done so much to turn mixed martial arts into one of the most prominent combat sports on the planet, is \"ready to move on.\" White said: \"She hasn't told me she's going to retire but I think she will,\" says the 47-year-old.Ronda Rousey was comprehensively beaten by Amanda Nunes in their women's bantamweight championship fight at UFC 207\"She made a lot of money, she made a huge impact on the sport. Women's mixed martial arts wouldn't exist right now if it wasn't for Ronda Rousey and she can go away having left an amazing legacy and an incredible career.\"When pushed further on whether White feels this way because of Rousey's shocking losses to Holly Holm and Amanda Nunes, he explained: \"Her and I are super close, we're very good friends and you know just like you would talk to any friend who just went through a loss or a hard time, you're there for support and she's always going to be a part of this company no matter what her future is right now... She hasn't told me she's retiring but I think she'll retire. \"I think she's ready to move on. She's made a lot of money, and she's accomplished a lot of things and I think she's probably going to move on now and whatever's next, she's determined, she's smart, she's talented. \"Whatever she chooses to do next I'm sure she'd be great at it.\" UFC boss Dana White said: \"Women's mixed martial arts wouldn't exist right now if it wasn't for Ronda Rousey.\"White is wrestling with plenty of changes in the business which has made him one of the supremos of global sport. Just last year, he oversaw the sale of UFC to talent agency WME-IMG for a reported $4 billion, yet continues as president, minority owner, promoter and, arguably, the face of the sport. And he manages to juggle all these tasks with his tongue firmly in his cheek: \"This sport is funny,\" he states. Visit CNN Sport for more news and videos\"It's the toughest, nastiest, baddest sport in the world, yet it's like a big hair salon. Everybody's pointing the finger and talking about everybody and everybody's upset, mad, and gossiping and it's like a soap opera. \"It just goes on day after day and it keeps the fans interested, it builds new fights, and it creates new story lines and it all just plays out. You couldn't write this stuff better, it is what it is.\"",

        "content": "Story highlightsChelsea 1-0 West Brom Conte's men win Premier League title with two games to spare (CNN)A year on from one of the worst top flight title defenses in the history of English football, the Premier League trophy is once again in the hands of Chelsea. A late goal from substitute Michy Batshuayi was enough to end West Brom's resistance at the Hawthorns Friday, ensuring Antonio Conte's men cannot be caught with two fixtures left to play.Follow @cnnsport\n\nCNN Sport analyzes the London club's spectacular rise from tenth to the title.Mourinho's shadowAfter a campaign of ignominy and disharmony under Jose Mourinho, the Blues are 41 points better off than at this stage in 2015/16.Read MoreWhile Mourinho was the architect of his own downfall -- squabbling with club doctor Eva Carneiro before his undignified departure in December 2015 -- Conte has been the architect of Chelsea's revival. His passion is infectious, and emanates from every pump of the fist. Chelsea can conceivably finish this season with 93 points -- the most by any Premier League team aside from Mourinho's record-breaking side in 2004/05.   A post shared by Chelsea FC - Official (@chelseafc) on Dec 25, 2016 at 12:34am PST\nBut how have they done it? Conte used the word \"work\" 21 times in his first Chelsea press conference in July 2016.The Italian made it clear that the players he had inherited would need to \"fight,\" insisting, \"When you finish 10th in the league ... the problem is not only one person.\"He was right. That person, Mourinho, left because of  alleged \"palpable discord\" in the changing room, but the issues at Stamford Bridge ran deep.Interim boss Guus Hiddink may have steadied the ship following his appointment in December 2015, but Chelsea still finished just 13 points above the relegation zone and as close to 18th as sixth.I hope we can surprise people, that there is a small flame flickering that can grow into a blazing inferno \u2014 Antonio Conte, July 2016Of the three clubs that made headline managerial appointments ahead of this campaign, the greatest expectations came from Manchester.   City and United spent a net total of $245 million on new players between them in the summer of 2016, rekindling the rivalry between Pep Guardiola and the Special One. Conte, meanwhile, quietly went about his business.He had been here before, taking charge at Juventus when the Italian club was similarly resurfacing from the abyss -- coming to terms with the \"Calciopoli\" corruption scandal and Juventus' resultant demotion to Serie B. Within a year, the former midfield general had led Juve -- dubbed the \"Old Lady\" -- to the Serie A title, the first Italian side to do so unbeaten since 1979.Stars rebornConte's influence was sufficient to prompt Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci to compare his boss to a \"hammer.\" Fellow Italian Andrea Pirlo, meanwhile, wrote in his 2014 autobiography: \"When Conte speaks, his words assault you.\"The new manager has certainly shaken Chelsea's fallen stars into action.Only Neymar boasts more completed take-ons than Hazard in the top five European leagues this season.Between August 2015 and 23rd April 2016, star player Eden Hazard didn't score a single Chelsea goal.Mourinho had claimed his forward was the \"best player in England\" but, just as he had thrilled on his way to winning the 2014/15 PFA Player of the Year, Hazard quickly became symptomatic of the club's wider malaise.Antonio Conte: 'I felt in my heart to go and clap the fans and also wish every single Middlesbrough player good luck for next season.' pic.twitter.com/0WToUqB1tv\u2014 Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) May 9, 2017\nUnder Conte, the twisting, turning Belgian has thrown off last season's shackles to score 15 goals in 35 appearances.Now he epitomizes Chelsea's dynamism.This season, he has completed over 50% more take-ons per game (dribbles past an opposition player) and taken twice as many shots.The 26-year-old could have passed when he picked up the ball in his own half during February's fixture against Arsenal. Instead, he shrugged off the attentions of Francis Coquelin and waltzed past the Arsenal back line before slotting past his former teammate Petr \u010cech.Costa has been back to his best this season, matching his best goalscoring season in England with two games to spare. Diego Costa has also been brimming with confidence, becoming just the third Chelsea player to score more than 20 goals in a Premier League season on more than one occasion -- following in the footsteps of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and club legend Didier Drogba.There may be murmurings of a move to China, but the Spaniard has stepped up when it matters, scoring the opening goal on more occasions (7) than any other player in the Premier League this season. INTERACTIVE: Build your Ultimate PlayerFlexibilityThe likes of C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta and Victor Moses have taken to new positions with great aptitude under Conte. It feels as if Chelsea's 3-0 collapse at the Emirates Stadium in September -- Conte's lowest moment and heaviest defeat since his days in charge of Siena -- occurred a lifetime ago. \"We are a great team only on paper, and not on the pitch,\" he said then, his bark reduced to a hoarse whisper. Chelsea hadn't won in three league games, languished in eighth place, and looked set for another season of mediocrity.But Mourinho's successor didn't sulk or bicker. Instead, Conte took to the training pitch, steadily implemented his favored three-man defense perfected during three years in charge at Juventus, and went on to lead Chelsea to wins in the next 13 league matches.Gary Cahill, David Luiz and C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta were reinvigorated in the back three, keeping seven consecutive clean sheets and conceding just two league goals between late September and the new year.     It's game day! Chelsea v Southampton at Stamford Bridge (7.45pm UK). COME ON CHELSEA! \ud83d\udcaa #CFC #PremierLeague @diego.costa A post shared by Chelsea FC - Official (@chelseafc) on Apr 25, 2017 at 12:09am PDT\nN'Golo Kante has put to bed any suggestions he might be a one-season wonder, making more tackles and interceptions than any other Premier League player since his arrival from Ligue 2, and picking up the PFA Player of the Year award. Meanwhile Cesc Fabregas has been used sparingly, but still notched 11 assists in just 12 Premier League starts -- becoming the first player to reach double figures in six separate campaigns. Where does Antonio Conte rank among the best managers in the world? Have your say on the CNN Sport Facebook pageWhile his rivals have sought to spend to solve problems, Chelsea's change was not affected by a new starting 11.     Good morning, Blues fans! \ud83d\ude4c#CFC #Chelsea A post shared by Chelsea FC - Official (@chelseafc) on May 1, 2017 at 12:30am PDT\nWhere Mourinho and Guardiola have arrived and attempted to mold teams in their own image, Conte has constructed the best system from the players at his disposal. It stands to reason he may not have been afforded time to administer his tactical changes had Chelsea been burdened by European football.But next season's challenges will be forgotten tonight as the champagne flows and the trophy is held aloft.He is the fourth Italian manager to win the Premier League, the fourth manager to lift the top-flight trophy in his first season in England, and this is his fourth consecutive championship title as a club coach, having won Serie A with Juventus between 2011 and 2014.He has, in his own words, transformed an \"ugly duckling\" into a \"swan.\"",

        "content": "Story highlightsJust 25.8% percent of French members of Parliament are are women19,000 people applied to be a candidate for Macron's La Republique En Marche! partyParis (CNN)The party of French President-elect Emmanuel Macron has unveiled the names of more than 400 candidates for the June legislative elections -- and half of them are women. At 39, Macron will be sworn in on Sunday as the youngest president in France's history, and he has promised to breathe new life into French politics and the country's sluggish economy.Macron's is now looking to get his fledgling La Republique En Marche! party a strong presence in Parliament to push through his legislative agenda. Emmanuel Macron's tricky to-do list after French election On Thursday, En Marche! secretary general Richard Ferrand announced that 214 men and 214 women had been selected to run for the party -- and added that 52% of the candidates had never held electoral office.The announcement appears to fulfill the party's pledge in January that at least half its candidates would come from outside the political establishment and that half would be women.Read MoreEn Marche! has said it will field a candidate in all 577 seats, so more are expected to be announced in coming weeks.Ferrand said the party had 19,000 applicants, 71% of whom were men and 29% were women. France ranks first in the world, along with Bulgaria and Nicaragua, for the highest proportion of women in ministerial positions, at more than 52%, UN Women data shows. But its female representation in Parliament is dramatically lower, at just 25.8%, ranking 63rd in the world. Winning the most seats in Parliament will be no mean feat for En Marche!, which is less than a year old and is scrambling to finalize its list of candidates to contest all 577 seats. Female supporters of Macron celebrate the centrist's win front of the Louvre Museum in Paris on May 7.Macron's party appears to be plucking candidates from traditional parties on both the left and right, causing panic among senior members of the establishment afraid of defections to the start-up outfit.He said the candidates were from the whole political spectrum, with the exception of Le Pen's National Front.\"This pluralism is the expression of the President-elect's wish for a recomposition of the political landscape,\" Ferrand said at a press conference in Paris. En Marche! has already rejected former Prime Minister Manuel Valls, saying that he did not fit the party's criteria. Valls has declared his own ruling Socialist Party dead after its crushing defeat in the presidential vote.The votes will take place in two rounds on June 8 and 11 to elect members to the National Assembly, Parliament's lower house.The party appeared somewhat shocked by its own success, and following Macron's meteoric win, En Marche! decided to rebrand itself, changing its name to La Republique En Marche! (The Republic on the Move) ahead of the legislative vote. A female prime minister?Macron is also expected to announce his pick for prime minister on Monday. He has given no clues as to who that will be, but has said that he is looking at one male and one female candidate.Does Emmanuel Macron's win signal the end of populism in Europe? Not likelyFrance has only ever had one female prime minister, Edith Cresson, who served for less than a year between 1991 and 1992.Macron has said that the prime minister's post may be temporary. If his party does not gain enough seats in the legislative elections, he may need to later offer the prime minister's post to a politician from an allied party. Macron won a landslide victory last Sunday against his far-right rival Marine Le Pen, with more than 66% of the vote. Although he had the backing of his party, he ran as an independent.Traditionally, the party of a new president wins the largest share of seats in Parliament, but En Marche! is still something of an unknown quantity to many, and it is not clear if loyal voters of the left or right will abandon their local representatives.But an Elabe poll for CNN affiliate BFM found that 52% of people want Macron to have a majority of MPs behind him in Parliament, whether or not they are from En Marche! or allied parties.",

Though the decision was later overturned, it exemplified the limitations put on racially abused players like Muntari who appealed to the referee to take action before taking matters into his own hands. \"I am pleading to FIFA, UEFA, whoever, (to) look into things like this, because, most (players) get abused but they can't say anything,\" Muntari told CNN Sport's Christina Macfarlane.

Because your teammates are your family, (whether) you like it or not. \"You see them every day and for them to turn their back on you was something not very pleasant.\"Muntari approached a section of the stands where he says he heard racial chants, and offered his jersey to a young fan as a symbolic gesture before storming off the pitch with just minutes left to play.Match officials in Italy are required to temporarily stop play and issue warnings to put a curb on racist behavior. Muntari says the fourth official confirmed he heard abuse from a section of the crowd, but tthe second yellow card left him \"feeling like a criminal.\"As American sports figures sound off on politics, their European counterparts stay silentMuntari also points out that the appeal for his one match suspension was launched by himself, with assistance from the Italian Players' Association, and not his club. Though Pescara manager Zdenek Zeman backed Muntari, he stopped short of applauding his decision to walk off.\"Muntari was right, but he shouldn't have left the pitch,\" he said. \"It's not up to us to dole out justice. We can talk a lot about it but then it must be left with the powers that be.\"Montari, in his defense, says some things are more important than the rules of the game. \"This is my skin color here that we are talking about, you can't say this to me,\" he says. \"I don't know why, but I walked off. If I were in (the referee's) shoes, I would stop the game, because that would set an example before the world.\"      'You can't run from your problems'Just 13 months from now the World Cup will be hosted in Russia, a country that has received its fair share of criticism for racial abuse from its football stands. In 2013, Manchester City's star Ivory Coast midfielder Yaya Toure was subject to racist chants from the stands at CSKA Moscow and voiced his disgust after the match.\"I'm not just disappointed, I'm furious,\" he said, while suggesting that other black athletes would think twice before attending the 2018 World Cup. \"If we aren't confident at the World Cup, coming to Russia, we (won't) come.\"Toure retired from international football in September, but Muntari does not want to see the hosts replaced, seeing the global tournament as an opportunity to introduce diversity to sections of the Russian population not accustomed to it. Muntari has played for a number of Italian clubs, including AC Milan.\"I think it is a good thing that Russia is going to host the next World Cup,\" said Muntari.\"They will show that maybe all Russians aren't racist. The world will see another part of Russia, and Russia will see another part of the world. They will mingle with different kinds of people, different kinds of states.\"Other players including Brazilian forward Givanildo Vieira de Sousa, better known as Hulk, Ghanaian Emmanuel Frimpong and former Brazil great Roberto Carlos -- who twice had bananas brandished at him in 2011 -- have complained about facing racial abuse in Russia.Football watchdog FARE Network documented over 200 cases of racism in Russian football in a 2015 report.Alexei Sorokin, the head of the body organizing the 2018 tournament, told FIFA's congress that Russia will do its best \"to ensure that every fan that comes is welcomed and has an unforgettable experience.\"Sorokin added: \"Watch great football, in a big, hospitable, culturally multi-faceted country.\"Despite the closing of its anti-racism task force in September, FIFA insists that its work is not done.\"FIFA's position on any form of discrimination is unequivocal: There is no place for racism or for any form of discrimination in football, as clearly described in the FIFA Statutes,\" it said in a statement.FIFA has also defended its selection of Russia, while appealing for all players to participate.@MuntariOfficial We will fight together my brother!!\u2014 Kevin-Prince Boateng (@KPBofficial) May 6, 2017\n\"History has shown so far that boycotting sport events or a policy of isolation or confrontation are not the most effective ways to solve problems,\" it said in a 2014 statement.\"We can achieve positive change in the world, but football cannot be seen as a solution for all issues, particularly those related to world politics.\"Visit CNN Sport for more news and videosMuntari appears to agree.\"FIFA has done well, because you can't run from your problems.

        "content": "Story highlightsLabour's leaked manifesto sets out plans for renationalization and increased public spendingOpinion polls suggest many voters do not see Jeremy Corbyn as Prime MinisterLondon (CNN)Theresa May's main challenger for prime minister in next month's general election is offering UK voters the most left-wing, big government policy agenda for nearly 40 years.Under a plan which amounts to a charter for left-wing populism, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn wants to renationalize large chunks of British industry, the railways and postal service, increase spending on health and schools, put up taxes for business and hike pay for public sector workers.JUST WATCHEDMay, Corbyn clash after call for snap electionReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMay, Corbyn clash after call for snap election 01:30The plan was revealed in leaks to the British media on Wednesday evening, and the details were not disputed by party officials during the day. The final version of the plan was agreed on Thursday afternoon, and Corbyn said the policies would prove \"very popular\" when they are published in the next few days.There has already been a predictable backlash from Corbyn's critics, including Britain's Daily Mail newspaper, whose front page headline described it as \"a manifesto to drag us back to the 1970s\" -- a reference to an era of nationalized, unionized industry and high taxes under a Labour government.But beyond Westminster, the policies -- which Labour says are \"for the many, not the few\" -- are likley to appeal to voters who are concerned about rising energy bills, overcrowded commuter trains and real-terms cuts to school budgets.Read MorePolling suggests that the brand of left-wing populism that Corbyn represents could have broad appeal and translate to an electoral surge, similar to the surprise grassroots support for Bernie Sanders in the United States and Jean-Luc Melenchon in France, when Britain votes in a snap UK general election on June 8.Nervous votersIn the same way that Sanders and Melenchon defied predictions by pollsters and commentators by punching above their weight and winning popular support to come close to being the main challengers for the presidency, Corbyn won the leadership of his party (and fought off a second challenge a year later) by winning huge grassroots support from party members.British PM Theresa May passes first big test of 'tough Brexit' strategyBoosting funding for public services and renationalization of key industries will certainly resonate in a country where the National Health Service and schools are facing real-terms cuts and rail fares have been increasing faster than the rate of inflation for trains that are often overcrowded and unreliable. A Sky Data poll last year revealed that 55% of voters supported renationalization of Britain's railways.And at the 2015 election, analysis by the polling organization YouGov showed that voters preferred policies from Labour's manifesto (under the then-leader Ed Miliband) to the Conservatives' under David Cameron. There was an overall net approval rating of +34% for Labour's manifesto compared to +24% for the Tories' offer.Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn speaks in the House of Commons in London last month.But the problem for the Labour leader is credibility. Miliband failed to win in 2015, and now, as the United Kingdom prepares for Brexit, voters are more likely to be nervous about radicalism. These may be popular policies, but elections are also about leadership and whether voters believe someone can do a good job leading the country -- and even Corbyn's own circle will admit that Sanders and Melenchon both failed to seal the deal. Voters may want more money spent on the NHS and have cheaper gas and electricity bills, but they still can not see Corbyn as prime minister. His personal approval ratings are -32% compared to May's +13%, according to the latest survey by Opinium.Last week Corbyn's party did disastrously in the country's local elections, losing nearly 150 council seats while the Conservatives gained more than 300. Critics have also pointed out that the draft manifesto policies, which amount to billions of pounds in spending, are also uncosted and would therefore lead to tax rises. Leadership questionKeiran Pedley of research firm GfK said: \"There is evidence that so-called 'left wing' populist policies are actually rather popular among the public. For example, opinion polls consistently show strong public support for nationalizing the railways and increasing taxes on the rich to pay for public services.JUST WATCHEDBritain and EU spar over 'How to Brexit'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBritain and EU spar over 'How to Brexit' 02:26\"However the challenge for the left is twofold. Firstly, we shouldn't forget that plenty of 'right wing' populist policies are also popular (on immigration, law and order, welfare and so on) and secondly, popular policies are not enough to win elections. The British left usually struggles -- in a tough media environment, it should be said -- to present popular policies as credible and deliverable to voters.\"This is why Ed Miliband can present popular policies in 2015 and lose and why I suspect Labour's manifesto in 2017 will poll reasonably well yet they will lose again. You have to get the leadership question right first and then the public will listen to you on policy.\"UKIP faces wipeout in Britain's local electionsA former Labour shadow cabinet member, requesting anonymity in order to speak without fear of recrimination, said: \"This idea of 'popular policies' is a myth. It's motherhood and apple pie. It's credibility that wins you elections and the voters know our leadership and our policies have none.\"Labour governments have done left wing things after 1945 [with the creation of the NHS] and arguably in 1997 -- the minimum wage, a windfall tax on utilities, fairness at work legislation. You just need to pass the leadership and credibility tests -- and that's much harder than producing a manifesto, which is a bit like writing to Santa Claus -- you can ask for anything you want, doesn't mean you'll get it.\"",

        "content": "Kiev, Ukraine (CNN)Ukrainians rolled out the red carpet near the country's parliament on Sunday for performers from 42 countries in an opening ceremony complete with all the theatrics one would except from the Eurovision Song Contest. Loudspeakers blared bubblegum pop as latex-clad contestants rubbed glittered cheeks with fawning television hosts. Balloons bearing the participating countries' flags soared into the sky over this capital city's golden onion domes. Around the same time, roughly 450 miles east, a more somber procession was taking place, as the bodies of three Ukrainian servicemen killed fighting Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine on May 1 were brought back to government-controlled territory.The Eurovision Village on Kreschatyk Street in Kiev, Ukraine.Some 10,000 people, including 2,673 Ukrainian servicemen -- at least five since Eurovision preparations began last week -- have been killed in the conflict, now in its fourth year, according to the military. Read more: Family life amid the shelling in eastern Ukraine's warzoneRead MoreNothing suggests that an end is in sight for the fighting, which has affected pretty much everyone in the country in some way. And some Ukrainians are upset that attention is being diverted from the battlefields to observe a week-long festival of camp.\"It's absolute madness,\" said Alina Anatolyevna, a uniformed member of the Donbas battalion. \"People desecrating sacred ground and behaving like a war isn't happening and people aren't dying -- this is not normal.\"The Ukrainian capital is the host of this year's two semifinals as well as the final. The sacred ground she was referring to is central Khreshchatyk Street and Independence Square. Today it's the site of the Eurovision Village, where visitors lounge atop beanbags and puff hookah. Three years ago it was where more than 100 Ukrainians died in clashes with the security forces of the former Moscow-friendly president, Viktor Yanukovych. The uprising forced Yanukovych to flee and sparked Russia's annexation of Crimea and the conflict in eastern Ukraine -- and set off the worst confrontation between Russia and the West since the Cold War.A view taken on February 28, 2014 shows a protesters' camp at the Independence square in central Kiev.But it hasn't been completely glossed over. Amid the Eurovision Village and fan zones -- with their beer gardens and big screens, selfie stations and LED-lit stages erected to entertain the 20,000 foreign visitors expected to arrive for this week's competition -- stand billboard-sized photographs of wounded veteran Paralympians. And hundreds of uniformed Ukrainian servicemen help make up the 16,000-strong security force protecting the event.It all strikes a jarring note in the otherwise celebratory atmosphere.After Ukraine's Eurovision victory in 2016 won it the right to host the event this year, there was talk about relocating it because of the country's security situation. But Vilyen Pidgornyi, a Ukrainian defense ministry spokesman, told CNN that would have been a mistake. He sees Eurovision as \"a demonstration of the West's trust in Ukraine\" and an opportunity to unveil a reformed country that has endured continental Europe's deadliest conflict since the Balkan Wars in a bid to become \"more European.\"\"People may ask, 'Why are we holding festivities when there are battles every day and people die?' Yes, but isn't this what the people die for?\".Eurovision on the front lineWar is not a foreign concept for Eurovision. In fact, the European Broadcasting Union founded the contest in the 1950s, in the aftermath of World War II, as Europe sought to rebuild itself through cultural exchange -- something Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko took pains to note in his address marking its official start. And Eurovision, often a microcosm of politics in Europe, has itself become a front in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.A Ukrainian serviceman walks through the rubble of a destroyed workshop after fighting with pro-Russian separatists in Avdiivka, Donetsk region on March 31, 2017.The first shot came from Ukraine, with its 2016 winning entry, \"1944,\" sung by Jamala, about Stalin's deportation of Crimea's Tatar population. It began: \"When strangers are coming/They come to your house/They kill you all and say/We're not guilty, not guilty.\" Russia, infuriated by what many observers saw to be parallels between Crimea in 1944 and the recent Russian annexation of the peninsula, protested the decision, saying the song was in violation of contest rules about songs being political in nature.This year, Moscow fired back, choosing as its representative the wheelchair-bound Yulia Samoilova, likely knowing that her performance in annexed Crimea in 2015 would irk Kiev. Sure enough, shortly after she was selected, Ukraine's security service announced she would not be allowed in the country -- the first time a Eurovision host nation has taken such a step -- citing her violation of Ukrainian border laws. As a result, Russia's main broadcaster, Channel One, pulled out of the contest, saying it would not broadcast the event this year.Related: Russia says no, drops out of EurovisionThat's fine with many Ukrainians, including Alina Kosse, whose cottage sits smack on the government side of the front line in war-ravaged Mariinka. Once a sleepy bedroom community, much of the town has been reduced to rubble by artillery fire from Russian-backed separatists. Not that she could watch the song contest anyway, as Ukraine's far eastern regions receive only Russian television. \"Personally, Eurovision doesn't matter when we're under attack every day,\" Kosse said. \"Everything is empty and meaningless, as well as the war.\"",

Bryan added that staff were alerted when the girl fell into the water. \"The theme park staff tried to help her and an air ambulance airlifted her to a hospital nearby,\" he said.

In one scene, she guides him through a practice run of a speech, cutting in to tell him to lift his voice.\"Every night we debrief together and we repeat what we have heard about each other,\" she told Paris Match.\"I have to pay attention to everything, do the maximum to protect him.\"Her adult children, Sebastien, Laurence and Tiphaine, are reported to have a good relationship with their stepfather and have been seen campaigning for Macron in T-shirts bearing En Marche!, the name of Macron's party.OPINION: Macron's victory is reassuring ... kind ofTrogneux (C) with her daughters Tiphaine Auziere (R) and Laurence Auziere-Jourdan at a campaign meeting in Paris.In fact, Macron made sure to get the blessing of Trogneux's children before proposing. \"It was a powerful act because not everyone would have taken that precaution, to come and ask us for her hand in marriage. I mean, it wasn't quite like that, but he did want to know if this was something we could accept,\" Tiphaine Auziere told BFMTV.Celebrating an atypical familyIt's not clear when a serious romance began between the two, but Macron appeared to be a young man who knew what he wanted -- at 17, he professed his love for Trogneux.\"Whatever you do, I will marry you,\" he told her as he left Amiens to study elsewhere.But Macron's parents didn't approve of their son's romance with Trogneux. His father told Trogneux to back off until his son was at least 18, Reuters reported, citing the book \"Emmanuel Macron: A perfect young man,\" by Anne Fulda. \"Nobody will ever know at what moment our story became a love story. That belongs to us. That is our secret,\" Trogneux was quoted as saying.Philippe Besson, a friend of the couple, acknowledged that not everyone was so accepting of their relationship.

They have made a point of making their relationship public, posing in glossy French magazines and describing their marriage as a celebration of an atypical but loving modern family.\"We do not have a classic family, it's undeniable,\" Macron said at a recent En Marche! event. \"But do we have less love in this family? I do not think so. Maybe there's even more than conventional families.\"CNN's Holly Yan, Melissa Bell and Judith Vonberg contributed to this report.",

The Madonna del Ghisallo became known as the patroness of travelers. Later, cyclists adopted the Madonna, and in 1949, Pope Pious XII gave her the title of Patron Saint of Cycling.And in the center of the tiny chapel an eternal flame burns in memory of all those cyclists of yesteryear.The climb up past the Ghisallo church is a regular feature on the Tour of Lombardy.Perhaps the most poignant exhibit is the mangled frame of the bike Como local Fabio Casartelli was riding when he crashed and died on the descent of the Col de Portet d'Aspet during the 1995 Tour de France. Understandably it's an exhibit Nannetti preferred not to linger over.\"It's sad. But as a racer I've learned not to stop and think too much about that because otherwise you will stop,\" he says. \"You know that can happen but you always hope it's not going to be you.\" READ: Froome's bike 'totaled' by hit-and-run driverThe bike ridden by Fabio Casartelli when he crashed and died during the 1995 Tour de France is on display in the chapel.'Peaceful'The chapel sits at the 754-meter high summit of the Passo del Ghisallo, a 10-kilometer climb from the lakeside village of Bellagio.It is a famous climb used every year in the Tour of Lombardy and sometimes in the Giro d'Italia itself.\"It's one of those must-do things if you're a cyclist,\" adds Nannetti, who describes the thrill of \"suffering\" through the climb and then enjoying the \"peace\" and \"cool\" of the church.\"What I liked most was the feeling I got walking into this chapel,\" he adds. \"It was peaceful, quiet, no noise and there was the smiley face of the caretaker. \"Also, you can walk in with cycling gear, which you don't normally do in church. Inside you think about all the people riding those bikes, big names from Coppi to the latest champions. \"On top of that you see some very beautiful bikes. You can see how things have changed. They still have two wheels and a frame and a chain but things have changed quite a lot in materials and weight and shapes and sizes.\"The collection became so big a bespoke modern museum -- the Museo del Ciclismo -- was built next door in 2006 to house yet more artefacts including an impressive collection of Giro d'Italia winners' pink jerseys, with three-time Giro champion Fiorenzo Magni as the driving force.Visit CNN Sport for more news and videosA new cycling museum was opened in 2006, the brainchild of three-time Giro winner Fiorenzo Magni.Bikes shrines in France and SpainItaly doesn't have a monopoly on bike shrines. The chapel of Notre-Dame des Cyclistes in Labastide-d'Armagnac in south-west France is another sanctum of cycling. It was given the seal of approval by Pope John XXIII in 1959 and houses a collection of bikes and jerseys from greats such as Jacques Anquetil, Bernard Hinault, Tom Simpson and Merckx.The Tour de France has passed the chapel four times -- in 1984, 1989, 1995 and 2000. Spain has its equivalent, too -- the Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Dorleta in the town of Leintz Gatzaga in the Basque Country.Notre-Dame des Cyclistes in south-west France is another shrine to cycling.2017 Giro d'ItaliaThe Ghisallo climb is not a feature of this year's 100th edition of the Giro d'Italia, which started in Alghero, Sardinia on May 5.With three stages in Sardinia before two in Sicily -- including a finish near the top of Mt Etna -- the race then heads to the Italian mainland, before finishing with a time trial on May 28 in Milan, which hosted the start and finish of the first ever Giro in 1909. The route includes six mountain top finishes and three major mountain stages including a grueling 227 kilometer slog from Rovetta to Bormio over the Passo del Mortirolo, Passo dello Stelvio and Umbrail Pass.Italian Vincenzo Nibali is the defending Giro d'Italia champion.The defending champion is Italy's Vincenzo Nibali, who has switched to the newly formed Bahrain-Merida team from Astana for whom he won his second Giro d'Italia three years after his first last year. The Giro d'Italia has seen 69 Italian victories from 41 different riders in its previous 99 editions.But Colombia's Nairo Quintana, riding for Movistar, will be looking to add a second victory to his 2014 triumph.We miss a great champion, a special friend and a great man.

The intensity of rugby is greater, and as a hooker he has had plenty of specialized skills to learn, whether it be throwing lineouts, winning scrums, or making the most of his ball-carrying skills. But his schooling in American sports hasn't completely gone to waste. \"I see myself as a basketball player when it comes to lineouts. You get the ball to a teammate and he dunks it; that's kind of the way I approach it. It's almost like another new sport in and of itself.\"The difference between the two sports is that I find American football a lot more explosive. With rugby it's ongoing, whereas American football is short bursts for a short amount of time. \"As far as trying to keep that physicality -- that's where the real challenge is for a lot of Americans making that transition over to rugby [...] After playing a full 80 minutes, my body's wrecked for the next two days.\"'A nobody, playing for the USA'International debuts don't come much more challenging than the one Taufete'e experienced.

Follow @cnnsport\n\nThe 60th-ranked Bouchard screamed and jumped up and down after she won her first match in five meetings against the five-time major winner who had once inspired her to become a tennis player. If it had been billed as a grudge match it quickly morphed into one of the best contests of this season as both women refused to give each other an inch in a contest full of tension, spectacular baseline rallies and momentum swings.Bouchard prevailed in the end, and their handshake at the net was cordial, with Sharapova saying \"well played.\" Sharapova shakes hands with Bouchard after losing to the Canadian in the second round of the Madrid Open.Read MoreAlthough Bouchard has often said she has few friends on the women's circuit, she claimed afterward the locker room had been firmly on her side.\"I was inspired because I had a lot of players coming up to me privately, wishing me good luck,\" Bouchard said in a news conference, without naming anyone.\"They were players I don't normally speak to and I got a lot of texts from people in the tennis world that were just rooting for me. I wanted to do it for myself, but also for all these people.\"\"Cheater\"Although Sharapova's comeback after serving her ban had split opinion among both male and female players, including second-ranked Angelique Kerber and top-ranked Andy Murray criticizing tournaments for giving her a wild card, Bouchard has been the most vocal.How bow dah pic.twitter.com/SOAcpEWflu\u2014 Genie Bouchard (@geniebouchard) May 8, 2017\n\"She's a cheater and I don't think a cheater in any sport should be allowed to play that sport again,\" Bouchard told Turkish broadcaster TRT World on April 25, the day before Sharapova made a highly-anticipated comeback to tennis at an event in Stuttgart, Germany, where she would eventually reach the semifinals. In October, the Swiss Court of Arbitration of Sport reduced Sharapova's initial two-year ban to 15 months on appeal, saying she bore no \"significant fault\" and didn't intend to cheat. Wild card controversyNow ranked 258th, Sharapova is in need of wild cards to play events like Stuttgart, Madrid and Rome next week because she didn't have a ranking at the time of entry as she was still serving her suspension. The French Open, which Shararapova has won twice, said it will take a decision on whether it will hand her a wild card on May 16.

Maria Sharapova in MadridIn the first set's seventh game, the former top-ranked Russian seemed to lose focus as she mistimed a drop shot at 30-30 and let her opponent back into the match by dropping three games in a row. After Sharapova received a pep talk from her coach, Sven Groeneveld, who told her to \"take a deep breath and get back to your basics,\" she broke straight back with aggressive tennis for 5-5.But Bouchard broke once more in the next game and this time didn't waver as she served out the first set with a huge serve followed by a blistering forehand winner. The match went to a decider as Sharapova quickly took the second set, breaking for 3-2 as Bouchard's level temporarily dipped. There seemed to be some psychological warfare going on early on in the second set, as Bouchard turned and smiled after she fended off a backhand that Sharapova had loudly drilled at her from the baseline with a volley.After the third set started with three consecutive service holds from 0-40, play was back on serve at 4-4 as both got broken.Faced with yet another break point, Sharapova went for broke on a backhand but just missed the line. Serving for the match, Bouchard converted her second match point with a cross-court forehand, her 20th winner.Although Sharapova produced 44 winners, her lack of matches in the past 15 months showed as she made 49 unforced errors, including nine double faults. \"I think I would be worried about myself if I sat here and said I'm pretty happy with losing a tennis match, no matter who I face, no matter what round it is, whether it's the first round or final of a grand slam,\" Sharapova said in a news conference after the match.\"Today was just not that day. Of course, I'm disappointed. That's what's going to make me a better player. That's what's going to win me more tournaments and more grand slams.\"READ: Why Maria Sharapova's return has divided the women's TourREAD: How doping ban may extend Maria Sharapova's career to 2020 Tokyo OlympicsREAD: Maria Sharapova's ban reduced to 15 monthsLosing streakBouchard's win is all the more remarkable because she hadn't managed to win a match in three-and-a-half months before she entered Madrid.The 23-year-old Canadian had struggled with the weight of expectation after a breakthrough season in 2014, when she reached back-to-back semifinals at the Australian Open and Roland Garros before going all the way to the Wimbledon finals, where she was overwhelmed by Petra Kvitova. Having finished the 2014 season inside the top 10, the media attention and extra pressure got to Bouchard in the years that followed as she struggled with a loss of form and confidence and saw her ranking plummet. After parting ways with coach Thomas Hogstedt in March last year, Bouchard reunited with the Swede who used to guide Sharapova in December. Although Bouchard started the season with a semifinals spot in Sydney and a third round at the Australian Open, she failed to win a single match until beating France's Alize Cornet in the previous round in Madrid and even played a second-tier ITF event last month in Florida to regain her confidence.

But Macron's mandate may not be as overwhelming as it seems. A record number of French voters were so dismayed by their options that they either skipped the election or cast their ballots for no one at all.      The so-called \"ballot blanc,\" or white ballot, has a long history as a protest vote in France, going all the way back to the French Revolution. This time around, nearly 9% of voters cast blank or spoiled ballots -- the highest ever since the Fifth Republic was founded in 1958. For now, the votes, which are counted towards the turnout, are largely symbolic. But there is a movement underway for the blank ballots to count as a share of the overall election vote. According to a recent Ifop poll, 40% of French voters said they would cast a blank vote if it were recognized under French law.  A woman in Bordeaux reads campaign posters urging voters not to turn out.The protest voteRead MoreGuillaume Castevert, 46, from Bordeaux in southwest France, said he voted blanc in the final round after his favored candidate, Jean-Luc Melenchon, of the left-wing Le France insoumise movement, was knocked out in the first round. Like many voters, Castevert was scared of a Le Pen win and wanted his voice to be heard, but refused to vote for Macron, whose policies he disagrees with. \"I don't want to vote against something,\" he told CNN. \"I want to vote for something.\"France: Emmanuel Macron eyes legislative elections after landslide winHe's also deeply unhappy with the French electoral system. \"I'm quite convinced that the election system is not very democratic. In fact, it's quite the opposite,\" he said. \"Every five years you make people feel like they are important, like their vote counts, but it doesn't really matter.\"Castevert said his white ballot represented a vote against both candidates and against the system he believes they represent.Democracy should be about the people, he said. \"Now it's not the power of the people, it's the power of a few people.\"READ MORE: Macron, Le Pen, or neither? French voters mull third optionHighest number of abstentions since 1969For disillusioned voters, the only other option was to abstain -- and nearly one quarter of French voters did just that.This year's election marked the highest number of abstentions the country has seen since 1969, when the conservative candidate Georges Pompidou crushed centrist Alain Poher.Much like in 1969, disaffected left-wing voters were apparently behind the high abstention rate. In all, a third of voters spoiled their ballots or abstained. Taking abstentions and white votes into account, more people rejected the candidates than voted for Le Pen.     Rim-Sarah Alouane, a PhD candidate and researcher in public law at the University of Toulouse, says that this wasn't a surprise.In the lead-up to the vote, hashtags such as #SansMoiLe7Mai (without me on May 7), #NiPatrieNiPatron (neither country, nor boss) and #NiMarineNiMacron (neither Marine, nor Macron) emerged on social media platforms. \"These hashtags show how society has changed, how the political landscape has changed, and how people are trying to take back what is theirs ... democracy,\" Alouane said.READ MORE: Does Emmanuel Macron's win signal the end of populism in Europe?

There is a voice, a big voice from the people that has gone unheard. These people decided that both candidates who ended up in round two did not address their concerns,\" Alouane said. \"At some point, we need to reform our electoral process and take into account abstentions and blank votes. We elected a president, but what is his legitimacy in the end if so many people didn't go to vote?\"CNN's Bryony Jones contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Paris (CNN)A fiery dance party broke out in the French capital on Sunday night as Parisian voters celebrated the victory of their new president, Emmanuel Macron.Thousands gathered in front of the Louvre, waving the tri-colored flag as they embraced one another under a blazing soundtrack of pop music among scantily clad dancers and neon laser lights. The set was perhaps unconventional for a presidential victory party -- but then again, this was no ordinary election -- nor an ordinary electorate. Throughout the campaign, Macron's unique political offering spoke to neither the traditional left nor the right, helping shake up an already confused electorate looking for political solutions outside of the norm.On Sunday night, with 66.06% of the vote secured, Macron overthrew any chance of his opponent, the far-right nationalist Marine Le Pen, entering a higher political sphere -- and Parisians rejoiced.Read MoreA couple dances at Macron's victory rally at the Louvre in Paris on Sunday night.It seemed as if the city was released from the plague of a decision unlike any other, collectively embracing a joie de vivre once again, manifested in the form of a new president whose landslide victory was celebrated until the early hours of Monday morning. In front of two gigantic LED screens with Macron's party logo \"En Marche!,\" a stoic man waving a French flag stood out from a crowd of undulating bodies. \"This is a new story and a new beginning for France,\" Loic Victor said. Victor, a 30-year-old international development officer originally from Martinique, a Caribbean island that's an overseas region of France, told CNN he supported Macron from the beginning because he defined a new political class, one that is \"not right, not left.\"Loic Victor celebrated Macron's victory at the Louvre on Sunday night.Macron, France's youngest incoming president, was once a political wild card. The 39-year-old centrist independent -- a former investment banker turned government minister who entered the presidential race without the backing of any established party -- garnered a solid footing through his pro-EU stance and promises to reform France's welfare and pension systems. But there is no doubt that his win was also largely thanks to the traditional left, a group that had no candidate in the second round of voting. Many on the left voted for Macron out of fear of the other option: a country led by Le Pen and her xenophobic, anti-EU extremist National Front party. Parisians dance and cheer at the Macron victory rally on Sunday night.At the victory rally, Anas Ammounah, a 29-year-old Syrian refugee, said he was especially on-edge in the weeks leading up to the election. Along with his wife and daughter, who were reunited in France six months ago, Ammounah waved the French flag as high as his smile was wide. He spoke of the generosity and kindness he received in the 18 months since he arrived in the country as a documented refugee -- and of the fear that it might be stripped away under a Le Pen government. \"We're here to celebrate a victory against Le Pen,\" he told CNN. \"We found that Le Pen would stop immigration and we were scared.\"\"We hope Macron will stop (Syrian President) Bashar, so we can return to our home,\" he added. Anas Ammounah, a Syrian refugee, attends the celebrations with his family in Paris on May 7.Returning to their home in war-ravaged Aleppo remains a distant dream for Ammounah's family, so they basked in the bright lights of Macron's win in their new home in Paris. The win to them was a victory for France but also felt uniquely theirs.As victory celebrations raged on into the late hours of Sunday night, a group of left-wing protesters clashed with police in a Northern Paris suburb.JUST WATCHEDWhat to know about Emmanuel MacronReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhat to know about Emmanuel Macron 01:32When asked about the protests, Macron supporter Pascal Bardin, 60, chalked it up as a typical reaction of young, left-wing political activists. He told CNN that the demonstrations didn't speak specifically to the fact that Macron won but reflected the French national pastime of protest.\"Whenever anyone is in power, they say 'degage' (French for 'Get Lost'),\" Bardin explained. \"Whenever anyone can't fix my life, 'degage.'\"Macron will face a daunting task in uniting a nearly obliterated traditional left (along with Macron's allies from the right) who voted for him simply in rejection of Le Pen. A woman walks past election campaign posters in Paris' 18th district. One poster, in yellow, encourages voters to vote against Marine Le Pen. At his victory rally, Macron spoke to this fissure.\"I know the country is divided and this has led to people voting for extremes,\" Macron said during a speech at his team's headquarters Sunday night. \"I understand the anger, the anxiety, the doubt which many of you have expressed and it is my responsibility to hear that.\"Earlier in the evening, as the final polls rolled in, a crowd of residents of Paris' 15th district lined the streets around Macron's heavily-policed campaign headquarters.Sabine Gruhier was one of them. The 47-year-old Parisian tech-savvy start-up officer donned a red hat in commemoration of the lives lost in the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attacks as she waited to hear the results.Gruhier told CNN that although Macron's win was \"surely the best option\" for her country, it was a shame that her fellow citizens were pushed to such a polarizing extreme that presented them to choose an option that didn't represent any of their political identities.Sabine Gruhier (L), of Paris' 15th district, gathers with her neighbors on the street outside Macron's headquarters moments before the polls close on election day.As Macron declared victory, Gruhier let out a sigh of relief, but vowed to remain politically vigilant throughout his candidacy. She called on Macron to investigate the spread of fake news online -- something she believes helped to fuel a grassroots spread of \"ignorance\" that led to Le Pen's rise in popularity. \"With this election I think people realized democracy is something fragile, and we have to keep fighting to protect it. Even if Macron won, we must still fight -- because the situation that Le Pen put us in was frightening.\"",

He'll be replaced by Catherine Barbaron.The movement will also be rebranded, becoming \"La R\u00e9publique En Marche\" on July 15.Read MoreAccording to Richard Ferrand, the En Marche! campaign manager, the organization has so far managed to attract 285,000 members.Ferrand says the party plans to compete in all 577 parliamentary seats and says that 50% of its candidates will be women.Macron ran as an independent, but he founded En Marche! less than a year ago. Transforming an outfit so young into a political force will be no easy task.But one recent poll by OpinionWay-SLPV Analytics, for the Les Echos newspaper, projected that Macron's party would win the largest share -- possibly a majority -- of parliament's 577 seats.  Does Emmanuel Macron's win signal the end of populism in Europe? Not likelyMacron will need a strong En Marche! presence in  the French parliament to push his legislative agenda through as the country battles high unemployment, a stagnant economy and relentless security problems.The government has also struggled to cope with immigration and integration, issues that drew throngs of supporters to Le Pen and her anti-migrant campaign.Sunday's results mark a meteoric rise for Macron, who at 39 will become France's youngest-ever president. The former investment banker has little experience in governance, serving as economy minister for two years as his most senior role. A supporter of Emmanuel Macron celebrates in front of the Louvre Museum in Paris on Sunday. An unexpected unityMacron addressed thousands of supporters outside the Louvre in Paris late Sunday night, making a call for unity in the country that has seen deep divisions with the rise of the far right. \"I know the country is divided and this has led to people voting for extremes,\" Macron said in the speech at his team's headquarters.French President-elect Emmanuel Macron's long walk to his victory rally was soundtracked by EU anthem 'Ode To Joy'  https://t.co/D0Mnfkd61t pic.twitter.com/gxaEB05cRR\u2014 CNN (@CNN) May 7, 2017\n\"I understand the anger, the anxiety, the doubt which many of you have expressed and it is my responsibility to hear that.\"A new page of our history has turned this evening, I want that page to be one of hope and refound trust, the renewal of our public life, will be at the base of what I do from the very first day of our presidency.\"But even before the results were in, France had made clear it was looking for change. Voters whittled down 11 candidates in a first-round poll in April to two from outside the political establishment.And the huge margin by which Macron won shows that the country may not be quite as divided as many had thought.The vote appeared to be as much a rejection of Le Pen as it was an endorsement of Macron. Several voters told CNN they would back just about anyone to keep Le Pen from the presidency. Ironically, it seems Le Pen has inadvertently united the country -- against her.JUST WATCHEDLe Pen congratulates Macron on victory  ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLe Pen congratulates Macron on victory   01:21Read: Macron's tricky to-do list after French electionSeveral candidates knocked out in the first round of votes publicly endorsed Macron, as did French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. Even former US President Barack Obama threw his two cents in, telling the world he supported Macron.But Macron's mandate may be more muted than the numbers suggest. Around 25% of registered voters abstained, the highest this century, while almost 9% cast blank or spoiled ballots. And while Le Pen's defeat was something of a thrashing, it was not as pronounced as the defeat of her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, who ran for the National Front in 2002 and gained less than 18% of the vote.Macron's Putin strategyBeyond a long to-do list on domestic issues, Macron will have to deal with fractures in the wider region, including Russia's increasing hostility toward Europe.During the election, Macron's camp accused Russia of trying to influence the French election by spreading \"fake news\" through state-controlled media. His team was also the victim of a hack, which a cybersecurity firm has said bears the hallmarks of Russian involvement.But Putin sent his congratulations to Macron in a telegram and called for a renewal of trust between the countries.  \"The growing threat of terrorism and militant extremism is accompanied by an escalation in local conflicts and the destabilization of entire regions. In these circumstances, it is especially important to overcome mutual distrust and unite efforts to ensure international stability and security,\" he said.In Brussels, Macron's win was met with a sigh of relief, as European Union leaders have watched several elections in the past year as litmus tests of the strength of their 28-member bloc.JUST WATCHEDMacron addresses nation after electionReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMacron addresses nation after election 02:05Macron had campaigned on a pro-EU platform, in stark contrast to Le Pen, who vowed to pull France out of the union in a referendum, as Britain voted to do last year.

Earlier, Le Pen told supporters she had called to congratulate Macron after exit estimates projected her heavy defeat. While she wished him success, she continued to criticize her opponent as an establishment candidate, saying the French people had voted for \"continuity.\" \"We have seen a major decomposition of French political life, of the old political mainstream parties and what we see now is a real new configuration which is emerging between the patriots and the new liberals,\" Le Pen told supporters.CNN's James Masters and Hilary Clarke contributed to this report.

At the end of last month, she announced that she had temporarily stepped down from her position as leader of the National Front. Some saw that as an attempt to distance herself from the party, regarded as toxic by many in France.But her position in the polls has barely moved since the first round.

        "content": "Paris (CNN)He was once the subject of mockery in French political circles. Now Emmanuel Macron has had the last laugh.The independent centrist, who had never held elected office, has become the Fifth Republic's youngest ever president after defeating far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.The 39-year-old former investment banker, who entered the race without the backing of an established political party, had been branded by his opponents as inexperienced.But part of Macron's allure is his atypical rise -- a civil servant who became a millionaire and eventually a government minister.Marriage a focusRead MoreHis private life has attracted attention, too.As a 17-year-old, he told his high school teacher that he would one day marry her. He fulfilled that promise in 2007 when Brigitte Trogneux, 24 years his senior, became his wife.French journalist Anne Fulda reveals more details about their relationship in her recent book, \"Emmanuel Macron: A Perfect Young Man.\" According to Reuters, the book tells how the teenage Macron defied his father's orders to end the romance with Trogneux, who was married with three children at the time. Macron's wife Brigitte -- once his high school teacher -- has been highly visible during his campaign.\n Since 2015, the previously very private couple have been spending more time with the media, appearing in several French glossy magazines. The marriage took center stage earlier this year when Macron was accused of having an affair with a man. He dismissed the allegations and criticized the rumormongers, saying: \"For those who want to spread the rumor that I am deceitful... not only is it unpleasant for Brigitte, but I promise that from morning until night, she shares my whole life with me. She's wondering how I could physically do it.\"From minister to candidateBorn in the northern French city of Amiens where he went to school and first met Trogneux, Macron studied at Paris's prestigious Lyc\u00e9e Henry IV before entering the Ecole National d'Administration, long a training ground for France's political elite.Appointed to President Francois Hollande's staff in 2012 after a successful career in the banking sector, Macron moved into the role of economy minister two years later, replacing the more left-wing Arnaud Montebourg.The beginner's guide to the French electionsBut his time in office was not without controversy. His determination to push through business-friendly, liberal reforms made him unpopular on the government's own benches.With a backbench rebellion and government defeat looming, the so-called \"Macron Law,\" which aimed to shake up the economy through labor reform, had to be forced through the National Assembly with the help of a controversial parliamentary measure.It led to several days of protest, but also to Macron's realization that it was not just the economy that needed to change, but the system itself.Announcing his resignation in August, he explained that he had \"touched with his own finger, the limits of the system,\" before catapulting himself into the presidential race by launching his own party, En Marche!What he's pledgedMacron's election manifesto promised to reform France's welfare and pensions systems.He has been vocal about the fight against terror and law and order, announcing proposals to increase defense spending, hire 10,000 more police officers and create a task force that would work around the clock to fight ISIS.Macron's policies had been aimed at wooing conservative voters, but he has also unveiled proposals to please the left too, such as his call for better pay for teachers working in poor, socially diverse areas.He is staunchly pro-European and has promised to put France back at the heart of the EU and defend the bloc's single market.He has also struck a diplomatic tone seeking constructive dialogue with US President Donald Trump, while expressing interest in working with Russia, Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia towards lasting political solutions in Syria and elsewhere.The frightening similarities between the US and French electionsAnd he's managed to pull in support from across the political spectrum in France. In March, former Socialist Prime Minister Manuel Valls announced he would be voting for Macron rather than his own party's candidate, and after the results of the first round were announced, defeated Socialist candidate Benoit Hamon and Republicans Francois Fillon and Alain Juppe pledged their support and asked their voters to do the same.Crucially, Macron managed to attract a number of first-time voters of all ages.En Marche!, which was only created in September, now has more than 200,000 members and his meetings have attracted vast crowds.With his strong support base boosted by Republicans and Socialists, Macron was propelled into the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.The campaign may be over, but the real work is only just beginning. As Macron himself said: \"A new page of our history\" has been turned.",

For many, the election was about the desire for a shift away from the current political classes, which many feel have left them behind.Beset by high unemployment, a stagnant economy, concerns around immigration and security fears following a spate of terror attacks, Macron will take the helm in France a difficult time.     \"Macron will inherit a country totally fractured in two -- everyone to the west voted for Macron, and those to the east went for Le Pen,\" said Sch\u00f6n-Quinlivan.\"It's a matter of reconciling those two France's and connecting with those who feel they have been left behind by globalization.\"The specter of Le Pen's presidential bid will loom large over Macron, if he can't find solutions to tackle unemployment, Sch\u00f6n-Quinlivan, is \"almost certain\" she'll be president in 2022.Europe breathes a sigh of reliefWhile the election of Le Pen would have been greeted with horror in the corridors of Brussels and with trepidation in most other EU countries, Macron believes that France must remain at the heart of Europe and work closer with its neighbors.So it came as little surprise that as soon as the exit estimates were published, some of Europe's most senior politicians were already congratulating Macron.European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker wrote on Twitter that he was \"happy that the French chose a European future,\" while president of the European Council Donald Tusk congratulated the \"French people for choosing Liberty, Equality and Fraternity over tyranny of fake news.\"Supporters of French presidential election candidate for the En Marche ! movement Emmanuel Macron wave French national flags as they celebrate in front of the Pyramid at the Louvre Museum.British Prime Minister Theresa May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were also quick to send their congratulations to Macron, who has been outspoken of his desire to work with France's European partners.Macron has been adamant that closer integration between the countries that share the euro will benefit not only France, but the EU as a whole. However, he's advocated for reform of the currency union and has said the Eurozone should create its own budget.A free-trade supporter, he campaigned in favor of CETA, the EU's free trade agreement with Canada, but he's cautious when it comes to Europe seeking new deals.He has also spoken against reinstating borders in Europe, instead seeking more integration within the trading block.\"Macron is viewed as an ally in Brussels, for the Euro and for the people who support the status quo,\" said Philippe Marliere, Professor of French and European Politics at University College London. \"The fact he is young is also seen as a breath of fresh air in French politics where leaders are traditionally older.\"Macron's key challengesThe third biggest economy in Europe, France has not recovered as strongly from the global financial crisis as its neighbors. Its unemployment rate, which stands at roughly 10%, is higher than the Eurozone average and more than double the level of joblessness in Germany and Britain.A demonstration against unemployment in Bordeaux.GDP figures are finally improving, but they remain at very low levels, while the growth outlook from the International Monetary Fund is one of the weakest in the union. \"The economy is doing slightly better and we've had a slow decline in unemployment in the past few months, but we've had mass unemployment for 30 years,\" said Sch\u00f6n-Quinlivan. \"This is the key issue that people want to see solved.\"Among young people unemployment is an even bigger problem, with 24% of people between the ages of 15 and 24 without a job.During the campaign, Macron promised to cut corporate tax rates gradually to 25% from 33%. He also wants to cut local housing taxes for the majority of French people and reform the wealth tax.He has pledged to cut public spending by 60 billion euros ($64 billion) a year, partly by making the government more efficient. He said he would cut up to 120,000 government employees by not filling positions as workers retire.A man, flanked by a young woman, waves a French national flag next to people gesturing and shouting on the French avenue of the Champs Elysees.He's also outlined plans for a big economic stimulus, which he said would radically transform the French economy, pledging to spend \u20ac50 billion over five years on training, energy and the environment, transportation, health and agriculture.\"People have been left behind and that goes for these communities which are not automatically immigrant-based communities or poor immigrant communities,\" Dominic Thomas, Professor of French and Francophone Studies at UCLA told CNN.\"They are people living in the industrial north and rust belt, whose communities have been completely decimated by industrial change.\"It's a situation, he says, that's no different to the rust belt in the US or the northeast of England.What happens next?One of Macron's first jobs is to name his prime minister, something he had been unwilling to do before the election.In the past he has said he would like to appoint a woman with parliamentary experience.What is clear is that Macron will need to move fast, with the first round of the lower house legislative elections taking place on June 11 and the second round a week later.How the election was Macron's to loseThe Socialist party -- whose leader Francois Hollande is the outgoing president -- currently holds the most seats (258) with the center-right Republican party the main opposition with 185 seats. Macron is hoping his \"En Marche!\" party can make in roads in the parliamentary elections.One recent poll by OpinionWay-SLPV Analytics for the Les Echos newspaper showed that Macron's \"En Marche!\" could win the largest share of Parliament's 577 seats. The survey -- the only one to be conducted so far -- looked at 535 of the seats, so an outright majority could also be on the cards.It would mark a meteoric rise for the fledgling party that launched less than a year ago.

        "content": "Story highlightsSecurity experts say it's not easy to keep banned fans from sneaking into ballparksThe issue surfaced this week after a fan was ejected from Fenway Park for using a racial slur (CNN)It's been an upsetting week for players and fans alike at Boston's Fenway Park, where baseball games were marred by two racist incidents.On Monday, a Baltimore Orioles player said fans threw a bag of peanuts at him and taunted him with racial epithets. The next night, a fan was ejected after directing a racial slur at another fan nearby.The Boston Red Sox responded swiftly and forcefully, issuing apologies and telling the offending fan he is \"no longer welcome\" at the ballpark. But can a sports team really ban a fan from a stadium for life? Security experts say it's not easy.First, let's list what'll get you bannedRead MoreRunning onto the field is a no-no, of course. A man was banned for life from Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards in 2012 after dashing across the outfield wearing only a cape and Batman underwear. Adam Jones of the Baltimore Orioles during Monday's game against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park.So is fighting, yelling obscenities or throwing objects onto the field. The Toronto Blue Jays banned a fan for life last year after he allegedly threw a full beer can at an Orioles outfielder while the player was trying to catch a fly ball.And increasingly, Major League Baseball is showing zero tolerance for hate speech. A home plate umpire even stopped a game in Philadelphia last season to eject a fan who was yelling homophobic taunts.Next, let's talk about how such a ban works Before ejecting a disorderly fan, teams typically make them sign a document agreeing to a ban, security experts say. If the fan returns, they can be arrested for trespassing -- even if they behave themselves. Experts say this can sometimes act as a deterrent.A team can check ticket buyers' names against a database of banned fans. And security officers are shown photos of prohibited fans and told to be on the lookout. Security consultant William D. Squires, past president of the Stadium Managers Association, said National Football League teams have been successful at identifying some banned fans and ejecting them.JUST WATCHEDSecurity beefed up before Super Bowl 50ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSecurity beefed up before Super Bowl 50 02:19\"The venues take it very seriously,\" he told CNN. \"If someone is stupid enough to get kicked out of a stadium, they're stupid enough to try to get back in.\"Major League Baseball may want to take some cues from the NFL on this issue. Since 2015, the NFL has prohibited fans ejected from one stadium from attending games in other cities. And banned NFL fans must complete a course on fan conduct, including a session on anger management, before they can apply for readmission.Now, let's discuss the loopholesBanned fans can just sneak back in, can't they? Yep, and that's the problem. There are no stats on the number of banned fans who are caught sneaking back into ballparks, and MLB did not respond to a request to comment for this story (although the league is reviewing its fan-behavior policies).But security experts say there is little teams can do to stop determined fans from returning to games.\"If someone really wants to get back into a stadium, they are going to find a way,\" said Diane Ritchey, editor of Security magazine.MLB gathering information on team fan behavior policiesBanned fans can buy their tickets on the secondary market and disguise their appearance. And ballpark security, faced with a crush of fans streaming through the gates, is much more focused on foiling a potential terrorist attack than on trying to spot a few hooligans, Ritchey said.\"It's very difficult,\" she said. \"If someone gets in who is banned, do you want to spend all your resources trying to find them?\"Finally, let's bring out the silver bulletWhen it comes to stadium security, there is one failsafe solution: Facial-recognition software.Stadium cameras would scan fans' faces as they entered and screen them against a database of known offenders.\"Casinos actually do a good job of this,\" Ritchey said. \"You can be banned from a casino (and try to get back in) ... and they will find you.\"But facial-recognition technology is expensive and is still years away from being widely deployed at sports arenas, experts say. Adam Jones, the Orioles outfielder who was subjected to the racial taunts in Boston, has a simpler solution. He wants to hit unruly fans where it hurts -- in their wallets.\"Instead of kicking them out of the stadium, they need to fine them 10 grand, 20 grand, 30 grand. Something that really hurts somebody. Make them pay in full. And if they don't, take it out of their check,\" he told USA Today. \"That's how you hurt somebody. You suspend them from the stadium, what does that mean? It's a slap on the wrist.\"",

The UK Independence Party (UKIP), the right-wing anti-EU party that has hived off support from the Tories over the past decade, saw its vote collapse, losing every council seat it had defended and gaining only one, with most votes declared.Read MoreThe main opposition Labour party also suffered a hemorrhaging of support, losing more than 100 seats in England and Wales and losing control of Glasgow council in Scotland for the first time in 40 years. Strong victory in prospectThe results suggest May is on course for a strong victory in next month's hastily called general election. In the UK, parties who gain momentum in local polls tend to improve on their position in subsequent national votes.The landmark week began with a leaked account of a private dinner at Downing Street between May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, designed to set the scene for Brexit negotiations, appeared in a German newspaper and potrayed the Prime Minister in an distinctly unfavorable light. After initially dismissing the report as \"Brussels gossip\", May changed tack, warning Juncker she would be a \"bloody difficult woman\". Theresa May stands with European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker at the front door of 10 Downing Street in London.In an inflammatory statement outside Number 10 on Wednesday, the Prime Minister accused EU officials of trying to interfere in the June 8 election by leaking details of the dinner. By portraying the dispute as emblematic of a battle over Brexit between a nation united under \"my team\" and an EU led by meddling \"Brussels bureaucrats\" -- on the day before millions of UK voters went to the polls -- almost certainly boosted the Conservative vote.May's strategy for the general election has been to pitch herself as a \"strong and stable\", unifying national leader against what she calls the \"coalition of chaos\" led by Labour, which is divided under embattled leader Jeremy Corbyn. Labour managed to hold on to some councils, in Cardiff and Doncaster, but Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, son of former party leader Neil Kinnock and tipped as a future centrist leadership candidate, said voters had left the party because it was perceived to be \"hard left.\".The UKIP leader, Paul Nuttall, directly linked his party's defeat to the public dispute between the Prime Minister and European Commission president Jean Claude Juncker, saying it was \"particularly fortuitously timed for the Conservatives.\"UK Independence Party supporters wait for the arrival of party leader Paul Nuttall in Hartlepool, England.Hot rhetoric aheadThe Conservatives' success in the local elections suggests the Prime Minister will only ramp up the hot rhetoric against Brussels in the runup to the June 8 vote.David Davis, the Brexit minister who was also at the dinner on April 26, said of the leak: \"Clearly what was happening was the commission was trying to bully the British people -- and the British people will not be bullied, and the government will not allow them to be bullied.\"JUST WATCHEDBrexit: What happens after Article 50?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBrexit: What happens after Article 50? 01:29Rob Ford, professor of political science at Manchester University, said that while May's public spat with Juncker will have helped, the Conservative victory was the result of a long-term hard Brexit strategy that May has been pursuing for nearly a year. He said: \"She has stolen UKIP's pyjamas on Brexit and immigration by pursuing this assertive nationalist rhetoric. All of Ukip's greatest hits have been played out of the Conservative stereo.\" Philip Cowley, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, said it was clear that May would stick with her strategy. \"The single most striking feature of these elections is not UKIP vote falling -- although that is clear -- but the Conservative vote rising, largely as a result of hoovering up UKIP votes throughout the country.\"\"To some extent that might have happened anyway, following Brexit and a sense that UKIP had achieved its main goal, but Theresa May's behavior will have removed any doubts UKIP supporters might have had that she was going to take a tough line.\"Appeal for calmDonald Tusk, the European Council President, appealed for calm on both sides of the Brexit debate on Thursday. He warned both Juncker's circle, who are blamed for being behind the leak, and the UK government that the dispute puts Brexit negotiations at risk. But Tusk's plea appeared to have fallen on deaf ears on Friday when Juncker pointedly made a speech in French because \"slowly but surely English is losing importance in Europe\".A landslide for May will not necessarily mean plain sailing for Britain's exit from the EU. Her patriotic rhetoric will only raise the expectations of what she can deliver, and with Britain holding few bargaining chips it is likely these will fall short.And if, as the polls predict, Emmanuel Macron wins the French presidential election on Sunday, Britain is also likely to face a tough and newly mandated opponent in the Elysee after Macron warned on Thursday that Brexit would \"not be walk in the park\".",

As one of two candidates left standing in the French presidential race, Le Pen has her chance to prove that the Front National's time has finally come. French voters go to the polls Sunday in a final round of votes to choose between Le Pen and centrist Emmanuel Macron.     In the shadow of Jean-Marie At 48, Marine Le Pen is a twice-divorced mother of three. She has regularly pleaded for the privacy of her children, seeking to protect them from the spotlight. Her relationship with her father, however, has been the subject of much media scrutiny. National Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen stands in front of his daughter Marine Le Pen, president of the party.Read MoreA bomb explosion at the family's Paris apartment when she was 8 made her aware of her father's notoriety. And after her parents' divorce, she began spending more and more time at her father's office. Her talent for public speaking led her to study law, and in 1998, to a role as a legal adviser to her father's party. As she rose through the National Front's ranks -- becoming vice-president, a member of the European Parliament and then a member of Parliament in France -- she she also tried to soften the party's image. This led to tension with her outspoken father. And it wasn't until she took over as president in 2011 that she was able to rebrand the party as she wished. In 2013 though, Jean-Marie Le Pen repeated his claim that the Nazi gas chambers had been but a detail of history, leading to a very public falling out and to his expulsion from the party he'd created. What does she stand for?Le Pen shares her father's core anti-immigration beliefs, which remain central to her platform. She wants to slash legal immigration from 200,000 to 10,000 \"entries\" per year in France, and also wants to see immigrants' access to public services limited.Le Pen stands on stage with other far-right European politicians at an event hosted by the Europe of Nations and Freedom political group.Le Pen believes that only her particular brand of political isolationism and economic nationalism can protect France from the twin evils of \"Anglo-Saxon multiculturalism\" and politically correct liberalism. Economically, she's a conservative who believes in protecting France's workers and its large social safety net. She presents herself as the true champion of blue-collar France and has managed to win over working-class voters, who are worried by calls from both the left and right for the liberalization of France's highly regulated labor market.Le Pen is in favor of a return to the French franc currency and has promised a referendum on remaining in Europe -- \u00e0 la Brexit -- if she is elected. She is also in favor of France's withdrawal from NATO.On a number of issues, Le Pen's positions mirror closely those of Donald Trump -- and she believes that his victory in the American election will clear the way for her own in France. Le Pen was spotted at Trump Tower in Manhattan prior to Donald Trump's inauguration.Internationally, Le Pen wants closer ties with Russia and she's been criticized for taking a loan from a Russian bank. In an interview with CNN last year, Le Pen said she was left with no choice after being turned down by French banks. Can she really win?National opinion polls indicated that Le Pen was leading the candidates ahead of the spring vote, with only the Republican, Francois Fillon, anywhere near her. But a growing controversy over the alleged payment of parliamentary funds to his wife for a no-show job threatened Fillon's campaign. And a fragmented political landscape made it hard for any of the other candidates to stand up to her. Support for Macron grew and remained strong, however, and the centrist pushed Le Pen into second place in the first round. After the first round of votes in April, Macron came out on top with 24.01% of the vote among 11 candidates, with Le Pen not far behind with 21.3%. A man holds a Marine Le Pen placard at a conference of European populist, right-wing parties in Koblenz, Germany. Just as in 2002, the last time her party made it to the second round, she will face the \"republican front\" that will gather behind Macron in a determined effort to keep the National Front away from power. Until now, this strategy has proven effective, both nationally and regionally.The party has, over the last few years, achieved high opinion poll ratings, but still struggled to win power. It controls only a dozen towns in France and at a regional level has been kept away from the top positions. But Le Pen believes that after the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom and Trump's victory in the United States, the wave of populism might be strong enough to break through the barriers of the past and to take her all the way to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e.",

But inner-city dwellers are hardly known for their horse riding prowess: Bonomo's main exposure to horses as a kid was watching them pull fruit carts. So how did a malpractice lawyer from Williamsburg, just across the East River from Manhattan, end up owning Always Dreaming, the 6-to-1 favorite in Saturday's Kentucky Derby? Follow @cnnsport\n\n\"In my wildest dreams, did I ever think that I would own a racehorse? No,\" Bonomo tells CNN, as he jumps in a yellow cab in between meetings in Manhattan. \"Did I ever think that I'd own racehorses that would be as competitive as we have been? No.\"Bonomo's naivete is reflected in the name of his stable: Brooklyn Boyz, which evokes memories of rap groups from the 1980s and 1990s rather than the rarefied air of the Kentucky elite. (For the record, he is more a fan of the Eagles than Brooklyn's Beastie Boys.)Read More Photos: The most exciting two minutes in sports?The Kentucky Derby, held at Churchill Downs, Louisville, welcomed 167,000 spectators in 2016, just 3,000 short of the previous year's record.Hide Caption 1 of 11 Photos: The most exciting two minutes in sports?The one and a quarter mile race is one of the highlights of the racing calendar, and has been referred to as \"the most exciting two minutes in sports.\"Hide Caption 2 of 11 Photos: The most exciting two minutes in sports?This year sees the 143rd edition of the race, where jockeys will compete for a $2.4 million purse.

The couple took a trip upstate to Saratoga Springs, the horse racing capital of the East Coast, where they \"fell in love\" with the town.\"The reason I'm involved is because of her,\" Bonomo says. \"She said, 'I'd love to own a horse.'

(Always Dreaming is partially owned by longtime friend Vinnie Viola, along with two other minority stakeholders.)\"Partners in life, partners in this,\" Bonomo says, noting that racing's greatest gift to him has been the family bonding experience. Along with Anthony Jr., who now attends law school in New York, the couple have two daughters, one a lawyer, the other a small animal vet.   \"The horse racing business for me has been more about bringing our family together to rally around something,\" he says, \"so it's been kind of cool.\"Always Dreaming, who won both his races this year including the Florida Derby, is sired by 2012 Kentucky Derby runner-up Bodemeister and was purchased at the Keeneland auction on the recommendation of bloodstock agents, as well as Anthony Jr.  \"He just stood out,\" says Bonomo, who stresses there was a lot of \"guesswork\" involved. \"There are certain attributes that you say are good, but you don't know what that horse is going to do.

When she comes up with the idea, that's it.\"It was always our dream to get a horse in a big race, and we're always dreaming in life, not just in horse racing.

'Unsung heroes'Although Always Dreaming is being looked after by esteemed trainer Todd Pletcher and ridden by Hall of Fame jockey John Velazquez, Bonomo emphasizes that it's all the handlers behind the scenes who make the difference.\"What we don't do in this business is recognize the hard work every day, not only of the trainers and the jockeys, but all people who work in the barns, the grooms, the hot walkers -- they are the unsung heroes of racing,\" he says. \"They do a lot for these horses that keeps them unnoticed by a lot of people.\"JUST WATCHEDKentucky Derby's unsung heroesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHKentucky Derby's unsung heroes 02:19Considering his working-class roots, it's not surprising that Bonomo prefers to deflect attention. When asked whether any clients of his law practice are aware that he is a big player in horse racing -- his stable owns around 25 thoroughbreds -- he laughs off the suggestion. \"I'm not a big-time horse guy, I'm a horse guy who got lucky,\" he says. \"You're at the top one day, and down at the bottom another day, so you've got to take it when you get it.\"Although Bonomo is not about to give up his day job anytime soon, he says that Brooklyn Boyz Stables is very much a self-sustaining business. \"My ultimate goal is to buy one or two horses like (Always Dreaming) every year, but that's not realistic,\" he says.

The Conservative party had already won 33 of the 67 council seats and needed just one more for a majority.But the final seat proved to be a tight battle -- and after two counts, there was just one vote difference between the two candidates.So straws were drawn. Read MoreDrawing straws to decide an election might seem unusual - but that's what happened after a UK council vote was tied https://t.co/OQ8iCr2Gk6 pic.twitter.com/QDYOeddyPA\u2014 CNN International (@cnni) May 5, 2017\n\nThe Liberal Democrat candidate Lesley Jennifer Rickerby drew the winning straw, retaining her seat on the council and denying the Conservatives a majority. She was clearly thrilled with the result.Local election guidelines in England state that when two or more candidates, competing for the last or only seat to be allocated, have the same number of votes, the returning officer -- the person in charge of the election process -- must decide between the candidates by lot. The officer could write the names of the two candidates on pieces of paper, shuffle them in a box, and draw out a name, the guidelines suggest.In this case, it appears that the one vote difference was considered close enough to be a tie, and the paper method was rejected in favor of straws. Polls were held across many parts of the UK Thursday to elect local councilors. Votes are still being counted in many places.UK snap election: What does it mean?Coming just a few weeks before the snap election recently called by Prime Minister Theresa May, the elections are being seen as a bellweather for public opinion.Theresa May's Conservative Party has made gains in many councils -- including Northumberland -- while the opposition Labour Party has lost a number of seats. UKIP, the right-wing, anti-immigration party that under former leader Nigel Farage campaigned hard for Brexit, has so far lost all of the council seats it previously held.",

It never gained more than one MP in the UK parliament, but the former Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron was so worried about the prospect of losing support from voters skeptical of the European Union in the 2015 general election that he promised the in-out referendum.Ballots are counted at the Election Count at City Academy Bristol for the West of England Combined Authority Mayoral election 2017.Farage resigned as party leader in the wake of the subsequent 2016 referendum, declaring his work complete. Since then, UKIP has been riven by infighting and factionalism.Read MoreEarly results indicate the governing Conservative Party has made significant gains at UKIP's expense. The Conservatives have adopted an increasingly hardline approach to Britain's exit from the European Union, undercutting UKIP on its central message and apparently wooing voters back to the mainstream.UKIP leader Paul Nuttall said it had been \"been a difficult night\" for his party, adding, \"We are the victims of our own success.\"The main opposition Labour Party has suffered losses in areas where it has traditionally been strong, such as south Wales, according to early results from the Press Association news agency, while the Liberal Democrats have seen a patchy performance so far, failing to make the headway they hoped for in southwest England.Thursday's elections for county council seats and mayoral posts are being closely scrutinized for clues to how the major parties will perform in the snap general election in five weeks' time. Campaigning is now well under way, against the backdrop of increasingly contentious debate over Brexit ahead of formal negotiations.While the local election results are not yet complete, Prime Minister Theresa May is likely to be encouraged by her party's strong showing so far, which may suggest her gamble in calling the snap general election will pay off.With results declared in 26 councils, UKIP had lost all 30 seats it held and failed to win a single contest. Its losses were centered in Lincolnshire, a former UKIP stronghold where Nuttall is standing for election on June 8, Hampshire and Essex, PA said.Nuttall: 'Victims of our own success'In a statement, Nuttall said his party's candidates had worked hard but there was \"nothing they could have done in the face of a big national swing to the Tories,\" as the Conservatives are also known.\"Our electoral success over recent years was a key driver in forcing the Conservatives to embrace our cause under a new prime minister who was campaigning for a Remain vote in the referendum a year ago,\" he said.\"Mrs May's public dispute with the EU in recent days -- which led to her speaking about standing up to Brussels in an eve-of-poll statement in Downing Street -- was particularly fortuitously timed for the Conservatives.\"Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage supports then-candidate Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Jackson, Mississippi, last August.UKIP enjoyed a surge of support at the 2015 general election under the leadership of Farage, one of the key players in the Brexit campaign, taking a 12.6% share of the vote. The party finished second in 118 of the 650 parliamentary contests but only gained one seat in the House of Commons because of the UK's first-past-the-post system.Farage famously flew to New York to meet with Donald Trump shortly after his election as US President, having campaigned with him during the 2016 Presidential race. He was eventually replaced as UKIP leader by Nuttall, a Member of the European Parliament.Sunday Telegraph columnist Liam Halligan told CNN that while UKIP's success had effectively pushed former Prime Minister David Cameron into calling the referendum, it now struggled to seem relevant.\"Now because the Brexit process is happening, because Theresa May in the eyes of many people who voted leave is really going for it, she isn't going to hold back, there isn't going to be any watering down -- then UKIP's role as 'watchdog' of Brexit looks like a bit of an anachronism,\" he said. \"They look a bit past their sell-by date, particularly because they have lost Farage.\"National vote indicator?UKIP's Roger Helmer, a European Parliament member, tweeted Friday that without his party, Brexit would never have happened.Without UKIP, we wouldn't have had a referendum; we wouldn't have won the referendum; and the Tory Party would never have backed Brexit.\u2014 Roger Helmer (@RogerHelmerMEP) May 5, 2017\n\"Without UKIP, we wouldn't have had a referendum; we wouldn't have won the referendum; and the Tory Party would never have backed Brexit,\" he said.With full results declared by 20 of the 88 councils holding elections -- all of those in Scotland and Wales and 34 in England -- the Conservatives had control of nine authorities, five of them gains, PA reported. Labour meanwhile had control of two councils and had lost control of two in Wales.Elections were also held for eight regional mayoral posts in England, six of them newly created.Counting is expected to continue into Friday.Online market research firmYouGov warned against reading too much into the results, saying that local elections have tended to be a poor indicator of national votes.Reality check from @anthonyjwells: local election results have been a poor indicator of national votes #LE2017 https://t.co/11sQTCMig2 pic.twitter.com/CwBXLsZTTL\u2014 YouGov (@YouGov) May 5, 2017",

Welcome to France.\"The migrants have come back, you know,\" the conductor says as we pull into Calais station. \"Trying to get to England. It's going to be a big problem again.\"For years, Calais -- just 20 miles from the English coast -- was the last stopping-off point on the migrant route that led from warzones and trouble spots the world over.     Thousands gathered, setting up camp as they waited to cross to the UK, through the tunnel, or hidden in trucks and cars. Their camp, \"the Jungle,\" was demolished in October 2016, and the migrants and refugees it housed dispersed. Aid agencies have since been banned from handing out food in the area.The camp may be gone, but some migrants are still here, clustered around an ornamental pond in the park, or sitting together on a roadside verge.Read MoreThat they have ended up in Calais may be down to a quirk of geography, but their presence in a region already struggling with high unemployment has provoked resentment among the community, helping to fuel a rise in support for the far right.Election posters in Calais.At one of the town's many \"friteries\" (fast food stands), Jessy Boin says he plans to vote for Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front, because she has vowed to cut the number of migrants allowed into the country, \"it's a big problem here.\"Meanwhile, customer Loic Focquer, who is unemployed at the moment, believes a vote for Le Pen \"will make the job situation better.\"Loic Focqueur hopes that voting for Marine Le Pen will give him a better chance of finding work.In the first round of the presidential election, Le Pen scored a convincing win here. She ran on a euroskeptic and anti-globalization platform, promised to improve the lot of workers, and -- perhaps most importantly -- offered something many here in Calais and elsewhere in France crave: Change.After decades of economic stagnation and high unemployment, regardless of which of the two traditional main parties -- Republican or Socialist -- were in power, voters in France are looking for something different.And this Sunday, one way or the other, they'll get it.They are faced with a choice between Le Pen, who has spent years trying to make the xenophobic, anti-immigrant party her father founded \"respectable\" to mainstream voters, and Emmanuel Macron, a relative newcomer to politics, who has never held elected office and whose En Marche! movement didn't exist 18 months ago.READ: Will Europe ride the populist wave? The heart of ParisMacron was a distant third in Calais, but came first across the country overall. He performed strongly in larger towns and cities, including the capital, Paris, where he handily beat more seasoned politicians, including the conservative Francois Fillon and left-wing firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon.The Place de la Republique is at the heart of the people's Paris. It is where Parisians come together to mourn in times of sadness -- mass protests were held here after the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack -- and celebrate in times of joy.One of the lions at the base of the statue in Paris' Place de la Republique has been defaced with graffiti. With the final round of the presidential election just days away, it is also where people come to debate and demonstrate. The statue at the center of the square, surrounded by flowers and candles after the Paris attacks, is now covered in political graffiti.As May Day marchers prepared to set out from the square on Monday, Assan Kericha cooked kebabs and sausages on a food stall. He said he voted for Melenchon in the first round: \"I don't like the others, but this time I'll vote for Macron -- of course -- to stop racism and to stop Le Pen.\"For Assam Kericha, a vote for Emmanuel Macron is a vote against racism. Natassja Naguszewski set up an anti-Le Pen protest in the square on May Day, at which scores of campaigners wore masks combining Marine Le Pen's hair with the face of her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, calling into question Le Pen's attempts to sanitize his anti-Semitic legacy.Naguszewski said she fears that, if Le Pen wins, France will become an insular police state, in which those considered \"foreigners\" are demonized.As well as trade union demonstrations, May 1 in Paris is also traditionally the day when people sell sprigs of lily of the valley in the street.Nastassja Naguszewski, pictured right, founded a group campaigning for people to vote against Le Pen. One such \"muguet\" vendor, who had set out her stall on the Champs-Elysees -- near where policeman Xavier Jugele was gunned down days before the first round vote -- said she was still deciding who to support, but wanted to back a candidate who would solve France's unemployment and security issues.The differences between Le Pen and Macron's support bases demonstrate the deep divisions in society that France's new president -- whoever he or she is -- will have to repair: urban versus rural, rich versus poor, elite versus working class.A quick glance at a map of the first round results shows another divide too: east vs. west.READ: The beginner's guide to the French elections     Macron countryThe next stop is Bordeaux, a prosperous university city near France's midwestern coast. The train hurries out from the station into the spring green of the French countryside, through bright yellow rapeseed fields and past the occasional fairytale chateau, until vineyards spring up on both sides of the track.Bordeaux's mayor, Alain Juppe, was briefly in the running for the 2017 presidency himself, but lost out to Francois Fillon in the Republican primaries. In the first round of the election, Macron came out on top here, followed by Melenchon and Fillon; Le Pen came in fifth.Jean-Michel Dewelle, who runs a plant and flower stall at the city's Capuchins' Market, says he voted for Macron in the first round, and will do so again: \"I'm convinced he'll bring progress ... it'll be a lot better for France if Macron wins.\"Macron has won flower merchant Jean-Michel Dewelle's vote in both the first and second rounds. As for Le Pen, \"she's a fascist,\" he says, bluntly. \"I absolutely wouldn't vote for her. I voted against her father in 2002 -- I supported [former President Jacques] Chirac; I didn't much care for him, but I didn't hesitate for one minute.\"Students Camille Baudoux and Sarah Sanchez say they will follow the 2002 pattern -- voting for Macron, who they would not normally back, in order to stop Le Pen.\"We're picking the least worst option,\" says Baudoux, adding she isn't sure who'll come out on top. \"I think there are going to be a lot of people who just don't vote.\"READ: The french election spells trouble for the EUCelestin Hernandez (left) and Adil Houdaibi, both students in Bordeaux, are also planning to vote Macron.Fellow student Celestin Hernandez cautions that, should Macron win, he will face a tough time in the months ahead. \"He won't have a majority in the legislature, and that means it will be difficult for him.\"In his men's clothing store in one of Bordeaux's main shopping streets, Karim Laiche says he isn't convinced Macron has it in the bag just yet: \"We don't know how it will go -- we could have a surprise,\" he said.But Karim Laiche warns that a Macron victory is hardly a sure thing, urging people to vote on Sunday. \"The polls are saying it's 60-40 to Macron, but polls can be wrong -- Trump happened in the US, and we could end up with Le Pen here,\" he says. \"So, we pray, and above all, we vote!\"Heading southeast from Bordeaux, the landscape changes slowly, becoming hillier, drier, rockier. The view from the train window looks, at times, like a Cezanne landscape.READ: Defiant rebel valley opens doors to refugeesLe Pen countryThe final destination is Beziers, near the Cote d'Azur. Many here are hoping Le Pen will find some way of swinging those unfavorable polls her way in the final days of the campaign.Beziers voted overwhelmingly in support of the far-right leader in the first round. Its mayor, Robert Menard, was elected with the support of the National Front, and has turned his town into a \"laboratory of the far right,\" where the limits of France's famously secular society are being tested.Menard was recently convicted of provoking hatred and discrimination (and fined 2,000 euros) for suggesting that there were too many Muslim children in Beziers' schools.The walkway in front of Beziers' St. Nazaire Cathedral honors Jacques Hamel, who was murdered in his Normandy church in July 2016 as he led mass. \"Everyone's voting Le Pen, even if they won't admit it,\" says one Beziers caf\u00e9 owner, who asks not to be identified for fear his political views could damage his business. \"Le Pen has solutions that everyone wants, but nobody wants to talk about.\"I like Macron a lot, but we've had enough,\" he adds. \"Economically, Macron would be a lot better for France, but Le Pen will actually do the things she says. I'm voting for her, to change the system.\"OPINION: France's election ending in a verbal cage fightElection posters outside Beziers' town hall is seen with Macron's eyes scratched out.Change is coming to France regardless of the outcome, and the winning candidate will face an uphill climb to repair the damage done by a bitterly divisive campaign.Many in Beziers are hoping Le Pen can overcome long odds to secure the win. But others in town, including restaurateur Maxime Roque, are preparing to hold their noses and vote for Macron in order to keep Le Pen out.\"Voting in the second round isn't necessarily a pleasure,\" Roque says. \"You do what's best.\"",

        "content": "Breil-sur-Roya, France (CNN)In the south of France, heartland of far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, a small community is sending a defiant message.In a region where anti-immigrant sentiment is on the rise and politicians are pushing to tighten France's borders, a group of people are opening their doors, giving migrants temporary shelter as they seek new lives in Europe.Standing on the porch of his home on a cool spring afternoon, 55-year-old Alain Creton looks out across the Roya Valley  -- a string of small mountain villages on France's southern border with Italy. In the last year alone, he estimates that he and his wife, Camille, 34, have hosted more than 60 refugees here, though they've lost track.       Since the refugee crisis hit Europe's Mediterranean coast two years ago, this enclave has become the frontline of France's fight against immigration as refugees try to head north.Perched on a craggy hillside, dotted with tepees and a yurt, Creton's off-the-grid home in Saint-Dalmas-de-Tende is a 15-minute hike up a steep dirt path from the nearest road.Read More\"We can't have humanity die on our doorstep,\" Alain, an ethnobotanist, said, sweeping his hand toward the fog-filled mountains, a rolled cigarette held in between his fingers.Camille Creton (right) and her children play a game with Yassir, 22, and Amir, 17.The Cretons are an anomaly in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur region, where support for Le Pen's National Front has ballooned since the party built an electoral base here in the early 1990s.Le Pen has campaigned on a nativist platform, calling for France to reclaim its borders and put a stop to \"legal and illegal immigration.\"She will face off with centrist frontrunner Emmanuel Macron on Sunday, in the final round in the country's presidential election. With the vote nearing, the group assisting refugees -- dubbed \"delinquents\" by local politicians -- are anxious about what the result might bring.Human solidarityIn a house tucked away down a rambling path in Saorge, a medieval mountain village overlooking the turquoise Roya river, Suzel Prio is humming to herself in her living room as she folds the laundry.The sun sets on the medieval mountain village of Saorge.The 55-year-old places clean towels on a sofa bed for 16-year-old Yodit from Eritrea.Prio says she began hosting refugees like Yodit when the migrant crisis hit Europe in 2015, flooding the continent with more than one million people in a single year.\"It's the minimum amount of empathy we can have for one another,\" Prio told CNN. \"It's about human solidarity... fraternity.\"       Like many passing through Prio's home, Yodit arrived in the valley from Ventimiglia in Italy. Thousands of asylum seekers have been stranded in the Italian port city, dubbed a \"mini Calais,\" since France clamped down on its border in June 2015.After being blocked from roads and trains leading into the French Riviera, a number of migrants have made their way north through the French Alps and into the Roya Valley.The refugees who make it to the French valley are often sent back to Italy by police under the \"Dublin\" regulation, an EU law that requires asylum seekers (in most cases) to apply in the first European country they enter. In 2016, 37,000 people were arrested in the department of Alpes-Maritimes, which spans from the French-Italian border to Cannes. Among them, 90-95% were readmitted to their country of arrival in the EU, according to a department spokesperson.      Prio says that she's fearful of a Le Pen win.\"The election of Marine Le Pen would be catastrophic. It would be worse for the refugees, it would be worse for the most vulnerable people in France,\" Prio said, adding that she won't be deterred and will continue to host.Prio's neighbor, 66-year-old Catherine Gros, lives in small home, just a short walk up a garden path. Gros recalls a cold day last December when about 50 refugees, many of them minors, arrived in the town square as residents were gathered at a church service, singing Christmas hymns.\"It's one thing to hear about numbers, it's a very different thing when they arrive in front of you,\" Gros, who has hosted more than 20 refugees, said.       In the wake of the Nice attack in July, which left 86 people dead, politicians from President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande to Le Pen have pushed for stronger border controls. Gros said regional politicians have taken up this baton.\"Local politicians use fear in this argument, so they use the Nice attack,\" Gros said.\"They have been moving further and further to the right because of Marine Le Pen.\"'What about us?'Some 10km along the Roya river, which cuts through the valley's steep rock cliffs, locals filter in and out of a farmers' market in Breil-sur-Roya.It's a Tuesday morning and few people are interested in talking about immigration -- a key issue in the upcoming presidential race. It's a touchy subject in this hamlet, which first hit the headlines because of local man Cedric Herrou's efforts to help refugees; action he was ultimately arrested and fined for. \"Ask me about anything you want, as long as it's about cheese,\" one vendor says when asked what he thinks about his migrant-aiding neighbors.       \"There are more people that are against helping refugees in this valley than for,\" Abid Boukhadra, a 68-year-old Algerian immigrant, who grew up in the area, said.\"There aren't many jobs, people have trouble making money. The French government isn't taking care of the French people.\"In 2015, at the height of the migrant crisis, the unemployment rate in the Roya Valley was 9.8%-- below the national average at the time (10%). Another local, Marine, who would not give her last name, said she thinks the valley will vote for her namesake.\"It's not strange for people to want to vote for Marine Le Pen, when the situation in France is so bad,\" she said.\"I don't have a problem with refugees, they can pass through, but the French government can't even help the French people, how can they help migrants?\"Searching for political solutionsSylvain Gogois disagrees.In the nearby town of Libre -- an enclave of houses on a rocky hill just 2km from the France-Italy border -- 66-year-old Gogois and his 64-year-old wife Fran\u00e7oise brew a pot of green tea in their wood-paneled kitchen.The couple, who has hosted up to 40 refugees in their home, were rattled when Fran\u00e7oise was in March arrested for bringing refugees down a mountain path to Sospel, to avoid crossing the border. Charged with assisting in the entry, stay, and movement of \"irregular migrants,\" her trial is set for mid-May. She faces five years in prison and a fine of 30,000 euros if found guilty.         Gogois said they were scared of what the police might do if they found them helping refugees again. But he vowed that it wouldn't deter him.Later that afternoon, Gogois said he planned to walk into the mountains to see if the snow had melted enough to drive a car through an unmarked dirt pass -- avoiding police patrols installed throughout the valley. But he says that they can't go on this way forever -- they need help.We have to find political solutions,\" Gogois said. \"We have to try to put sufficient pressure on the French government so that they accept more refugees.\"Sylvain Gogois maps out a migrant route through the mountains.In 2015, France pledged to accept 30,000 refugees from camps in Italy and Greece as part of an EU-wide agreement, but has fallen short of that.\"Think about it this way,\" Gogois said. \"France said that it would accept 30,000 refugees. There are about 36,000 villages in France. That's not even one refugee per village.\"'Fraternit\u00e9 is long gone'About an hour drive south from Libre, on the main road out of the Roya Valley -- which snakes through Italy and past two border checkpoints before returning to France -- sits the city of Nice, a jewel on the glittering C\u00f4te D'Azur.The Riviera, one of the richest regions in France, is synonymous with mega-yachts and eye-watering fortunes. But the area also has a large wealth disparity, and isn't resistant to France's historically high 10% unemployment rate.  On a sunny spring afternoon, Pierre-Alain Mannoni, a 46-year-old geography researcher at the University of Nice, sips an espresso at a caf\u00e9 in Nice's old village -- just meters from where last year's terror attack took place.Mannoni, who has become a champion of the refugee cause, said people have become increasingly fearful in Nice -- where the local National Front office claims one in two voters plan to cast their ballots for Le Pen.This region, in the world, is one of the richest. There is no reason people should be in danger of dying.Pierre-Alain MannoniMannoni was visiting the Cretons at their home last October when three young Eritrean women arrived nearby. The women were \"badly injured, frightened, and cold,\" Mannoni recalled.Alain Creton asked Mannoni if he could help drive the women to Nice, so that they could be treated in the hospital.\"The choice was simple. They had to be helped,\" Mannoni said, rolling a cigarette.\"This region, in the world, is one of the richest. There is no reason people should be in danger of dying.\"Mannoni was driving to Nice when he was flagged down by police at a toll on the French-Italian border and arrested for transporting the women.  In January, a judge cleared Mannoni of the charges, ruling he had acted to \"preserve the dignity and integrity of the three migrant women.\" Responding to the ruling, Christian Estrosi, president of the regional council of Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur and former mayor of Nice, said Mannoni was guilty of \"endangering the safety of the French people\" in a post on Facebook.\"I think fraternit\u00e9 is long gone in France,\" Mannoni said as he tapped his cigarette on an ashtray.'What they're doing isn't normal'In Nice's famous Cours Saleya market, busy with shoppers browsing past juicy red strawberries, pink peonies, and lavender soaps, few are willing to talk about Le Pen and the election.Vendors sorting their wares under red and white striped awnings and people on the street echoed the same sentiment: \"our politicians are thieves.\"The general distaste in Nice for their candidates points to the deeper desire by the French electorate to shake up the status quo.Peonies for sale in Cours Saleya flower market.Richard, 67, a wiry, bespectacled man selling traditional French bread and pastries said that Le Pen would get his backing.\"I'm voting for Le Pen for many reasons...for leaving the euro, getting out of the union, for tighter border controls, for immigration, for security,\" Richard, who wouldn't give his last name, said in between serving customers.\"The Roya Valley is not far from here. For me, what they're doing isn't normal.\"'They're saving us'Back in Saint-Dalmas-de-Tende, the Cretons sit down to lunch with two young men -- Yassir, 22, and Amir, 17, both from Sudan's Darfur region.When Yassir arrived three weeks ago he didn't speak, Alain says. Now, the young man, who refers to Alain as \"Baba Blanc\" (father white), is practicing his French over lunch. Yassir says \"merci,\" flashing a grin as Camille passes him a pitcher of water.      \n\"How many politicians are really thinking of a solution?\" Camille, a geologist and local mountain guide, asks in between bites. \"It's only when many people believe in creating a humanitarian solution that it happens, that politicians are forced to make it happen.\"Alain nods slowly, brushing his tangled hair back from his face and taking a sip from his glass of red wine.\"We will continue helping them until there's a solution,\" Alain says.\"We aren't saving them...they're saving us.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)On a night marred by insults, one stood out.  \"France will be led by a woman, either me or Mrs Merkel,\" Marine Le Pen said of her opponent, Emmanuel Macron, during a two-hour grudge match on French television as the presidential campaign entered its closing days. It was a deft jibe, emasculating Macron, and at the same time playing into her supporters' fears of a France crushed by a German-dominated Europe. It would have resonated in Brussels, too, where the prospect of a Le Pen presidency brings eurocrats out in cold sweats. During the campaign, Le Pen has railed against an imperious EU, suggested France would leave the euro, and promised to hold a referendum on France's continued membership of the bloc.Read MoreMarine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron go head-to-head on French TV. Such an outcome on Sunday would send shockwaves through the EU, already battling to maintain a united front against a belligerent Britain even before formal Brexit talks have begun. The fear in Brussels is that President Le Pen, emboldened by Theresa May's hardline Brexit in the UK, will make plans for Frexit as soon as she is able. But unlike Brexit, which involves the departure of already semi-detached nation outside of the border-free Schengen area and the euro, the departure of France, one of the political and economic powerhouses of the EU, would surely spell the end of the bloc. But even a Macron victory would have ramifications far beyond France's borders. Europe and Macron On the face of it, a Macron presidency should bring sighs of relief in Brussels. Macron, a former economy minister under Francois Hollande, is an outward-looking, economically liberal veteran of the Brussels ministerial meeting circuit. But Macron, who was avowedly pro-EU during the earlier stages of the campaign, shifted to a more Eurosceptic position after the first round, which he won with 24% of the vote. The centrist candidate has had to temper his pro-Europeanism to appeal to voters beyond his support base, including those who backed the far-left anti-EU Jean-Luc Melenchon. In order to secure a convincing win against Le Pen he also needs to reach out to disaffected voters. In the same way that Americans backed Donald Trump, there is a deep desire for change in France. Yet many voters are thinking of abstaining this Sunday because they feel unable to choose between the far-right and the establishment center.Emmanuel Macron has hardened his stance on the EU. As a result, Macron gave an interview on Monday calling for reform of the EU, warning that it would be a \"betrayal\" if the bloc continued as it was and that a failure to reform would hasten a \"Frexit\". Of course, it helps Macron to appear more Eurosceptic as he goes up against Le Pen But this is more than just an empty threat - it is likely that once established in the Elysee, Macron will go ahead with pushing for reform. Europe and Le Pen A victory for Le Pen on Sunday would by no means guarantee France's departure from the European Union. For one thing, she has stepped back from a hardline position as she has sought to extend support from beyond her base. In any case, membership of the EU is embedded in the French constitution and Frexit would need the approval of the French national assembly, which would almost certainly block the move.JUST WATCHEDWhy these French voters support Le PenReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhy these French voters support Le Pen 00:52 But a Le Pen presidency would  result in a hardline Euroskeptic Elysee squaring up against Brussels, making trouble for the future stability of the bloc. Even if she is unable to implement Frexit, Le Pen could call a referendum on the euro -- which she has described as a \"weapon in the hands of the European Central Bank\" - and press for France to withdraw from the border-free Schengen area. After the spate of terrorist attacks in Europe, several countries including France imposed border controls and under the terms of the Schengen Agreement, these can be extended to two years in exceptional circumstances -- a move President Le Pen would likely instigate. EU debate at forefront of campaign Axelle Lemaire, a French Socialist MP and minister in the current government, said the election had given voters the opportunity for a \"real debate\" about the future of the EU and France's place inside it. She said: \"Between the two rounds each candidate tries to attract the largest majority of voters possible, and so it is not surprising to hear Marine Le Pen talk about how there could be 'co-existence' between the two currencies.\": Macron, Le Pen, or neither? French voters mull third option\"Emmanuel Macron is becoming more vocal in his criticism of the EU. He is still a strong supporter of the European project and its ambition but he has been critical of its transparency, democracy and efficiency and whether it is creating jobs and prosperity.\" Lemaire said that even if Macron wins on Sunday he would still be keen to have a reformed EU.\"I think he is sincere in his request for reform. It is not possible to accept the situation as it is, and people don't accept it as it is. So this means dealing with Germany, especially if it is run again by Angela Merkel, by saying 'let's try to re-instill ambition in the European project'. I think he will carry out a reform agenda.\" Whoever wins, either Le Pen or Macron as president could use the Brexit process to shoe-horn changes to its relationship with the EU, by tacking on demands during the EU27 negotiations. Without a doubt, a Le Pen victory poses the greater threat to the future existence of the EU. Yet even if Macron triumphs, it is clear that the EU will not be able to dodge significant reform for much longer.",

Our 30 Clubs will continue to work with fans and security to provide a family-friendly environment.  Any individual who behaves in such offensive fashion will be immediately removed from the ballpark and subject to further action.\"In a second incident Tuesday, a fan was ejected and banned from Fenway Park for life after reportedly directing a racial slur at another fan. Again, the Red Sox responded swiftly.\"During Tuesday night's Red Sox-Orioles game, it was reported to Red Sox security that a racial slur was used in a comment from one fan to another fan,\" the Red Sox said in a statement released Wednesday. \"The offending individual was promptly ejected from the ballpark, and has since been notified they are no longer welcome at Fenway Park.\"The Red Sox organization will not tolerate the use of racial slurs at Fenway Park, and we have apologized to those affected. There is no place for racial epithets at Fenway Park, in baseball, or in our society.

With Spanish riders occupying 10 of the 23 spaces on starting grid, it will be a homecoming for almost half of the premier-class riders. Follow @cnnsport\n\nIt will also be a stark contrast to the previous race in Austin, Texas, where not a single American racer could be found in any of the three classes.At the stunning Circuit of the Americas, curled around an undulating stretch of scrubland on the city's outskirts, there were reminders of America's golden age, with four of its most successful racers present at the track.With US stalwarts Wayne Rainey, Kevin Schwantz, Kenny Roberts and his son Kenny Roberts Jr. standing by, CNN Sport asked the question: Just what's happened to all the great Americans in MotoGP?Read MoreIt's the moneyKenny Roberts Jr., who was celebrating his induction into the MotoGP Hall of Fame, acknowledges that having a world-champion father gave him a distinct advantage.Joining his father in the Hall of Fame... yesterday, Kenny Roberts Jnr became an official #MotoGP Legend!\ud83d\udc4f#AmericasGP pic.twitter.com/51qN15X3NH\u2014 MotoGP\u2122 (@MotoGP) April 22, 2017\n\"I raced and practiced with world champions at a very young level, so it gave me an understanding of where I eventually needed to be,\" he told CNN.  \"I knew everything it took instead of wondering what it took, if that makes sense.\"The 43-year-old believes entering the sport now is tougher than ever.  Part of the reason, he says, is financial.  \"I think it's much harder to get into now. The bikes are very close and the first top of the class in Moto3 are getting paid, but the last half -- even three quarters -- aren't making money. \"They're bringing money to a team ... and when you start doing that it's very difficult I think.\"Behind the curveKevin Schwantz, the 1993 world champion who helped design the Austin circuit, believes Americans are at an immediate disadvantage compared with their European rivals.  #BritishGP '94:\u25b6\ufe0f Schwantz last victory\u25b6\ufe0f First to use 16,5-inch @Michelin_Sport tyres\ud83c\udfa5 https://t.co/fHtVMyl3K1 pic.twitter.com/KzF5ayu1yn\u2014 MotoGP\u2122 (@MotoGP) September 1, 2016\n\"It's very difficult for American kids to get into the world championship loop,\" he told CNN.  \"I mean, Italy, Germany, Spain, everybody's got their pre-Moto3 championships, young kids can get there and start riding when they're 13 or 14.\"He points to one emerging American star who could break through, although he has had to travel to Europe to do it.\"We've got this kid, Damian Jigalov, in Italy racing and he's 12 years old, riding at 300 km/h, and he's better than anyone else on the track,\" added Schwantz. 500ccm: Kevin Schwantz, Assen 1993@KevinSchwantz @SuzukiOfficial @ttcircuitassen @MotoGP #DutchGP#TTAssen pic.twitter.com/8SQNHuxVmb\u2014 Racing News (@RacingNews56) June 22, 2015\n\"He's going to Europe, and doing races, and opening people's eyes a little bit.\"However, most American riders, Schwantz says, are behind the curve before they even start. \"I think our problem here is that most of us don't think our kids can do anything until they're 16, when they can come race in MotoAmerica and be a professional,\" he explained.   \"If you're not on tracks where Grands Prix are being raced by the time you're 16 you're well behind the Europeans, because they've been there for a couple of years by the time they're that age and it's just such an easy transition.\"Developing talentCarmelo Ezpeleta, head of MotoGP administrator Dorna, believes the absence of a feeder championship in the US is a key reason American talent is no longer breaking through.  \"One big factor is the disappearance of the AMA Superbike series, because national competition has a great effect on creating champions in every country,\" he told CNN.

I am sure there will be great American champions in the future again, just as there were in the past.\"Ezpeleta would also like to see a new junior series in the US.  \"An American Talent Cup could be the future for talent discovery and promotion in North America,\" he said. \"Something similar to the Asia Talent Cup or the soon-to-start British Talent Cup. One of the key things upon which the future of the sport depends is the talent and the riders, because they create so much of the show -- one of the greatest on Earth.\"#GiveMe5 \ud83d\udcf8\ud83d\udcf8\ud83d\udcf8\ud83d\udcf8\ud83d\udcf8The traditional #AmericasGP podium #selfie! pic.twitter.com/F8LOnTsXPf\u2014 MotoGP\u2122 (@MotoGP) April 23, 2017\nA 15-year projectRoberts Jr. acknowledges Dorna's efforts, but believes the US may have a long wait before its riders repopulate the MotoGP grid. \"To get Americans back into it, it's got to be an entire team effort,\" he told CNN. \"It's like the Olympics -- you don't want just Spaniards and Italians and so on, it has to be an entire mix.  \"I know Dorna is making a big push to make sure young talent is coming through the field in other countries, and that's what they have to do here.

I mean, just the airfare getting people wherever you've got to get them, has quadrupled the budget.\"By contrast, Schwantz says, MotoAmerica struggles for cash. \"What else that's lacking here in America is the support from the manufacturers,\" the former Suzuki rider told CNN.\"There's no real sponsors -- outside sponsors -- involved in MotoAmerica, so no real manufacturer support, and for sure without the sales of motorcycles and sports bikes where they used to be, you're not going to get a Suzuki spending $10 million racing.\"READ: Marc Marquez's moment of destinyAmerica still loves bikesSchwantz also points to a decline in interest in sports bikes on the streets of US, telling CNN it's become more about the \"vintage scene.\"Induction upcoming for Kenny Roberts Jr. Into the @MotoGP Legends.

Better accessBut Schwantz believes the spectator experience could be improved, telling CNN he would \"try and make things more accessible to the average person that comes, not just the person that has the paddock pass.\"Schwantz understands the pressure on riders like Valentino Rossi to spend time with fans, but recalls his first interactions with spectators as a young racer, when veteran competitor John Ulrich told him he'd quickly get tired of signing autographs.The older rider told Schwantz: \"what you're really gonna hate is when they don't want them anymore, so sign as many as you can.\" Photos: The making of a motorcycling championHide Caption 1 of 19 Photos: The making of a motorcycling championHide Caption 2 of 19 Photos: The making of a motorcycling championHide Caption 3 of 19 Photos: The making of a motorcycling championHide Caption 4 of 19 Photos: The making of a motorcycling championHide Caption 5 of 19 Photos: The making of a motorcycling championHide Caption 6 of 19 Photos: The making of a motorcycling championHide Caption 7 of 19 Photos: The making of a motorcycling championHide Caption 8 of 19 Photos: The making of a motorcycling championHide Caption 9 of 19 Photos: The making of a motorcycling championHide Caption 10 of 19 Photos: The making of a motorcycling championHide Caption 11 of 19 Photos: The making of a motorcycling championHide Caption 12 of 19 Photos: The making of a motorcycling championHide Caption 13 of 19 Photos: The making of a motorcycling championHide Caption 14 of 19 Photos: The making of a motorcycling championHide Caption 15 of 19 Photos: The making of a motorcycling championHide Caption 16 of 19 Photos: The making of a motorcycling championHide Caption 17 of 19 Photos: The making of a motorcycling championHide Caption 18 of 19 Photos: The making of a motorcycling championHide Caption 19 of 19Life after RossiAway from the dearth of Americans, there's no doubt championship leader Valentino Rossi's appeal remains a huge part of MotoGP's popularity, and the prospect of life after the charismatic Italian is another big question for the sport.

I think MotoGP is in a good place right now.\"Roberts Jr. jokes Rossi \"has to ask\" him permission to retire.\"I have to give it my blessing,\" smiled the 2000 championship winner. \"Maybe that's what he's been waiting for, maybe he's been waiting for me to tell him he can stop.

She called herself the \"candidate of the people, of the France we love. \"    Macron shot back that Le Pen lacked finesse and, for many years, has profited on the anger of the French people and promoted the \"spirit of defeatism.\"JUST WATCHEDWhat to know about Emmanuel MacronReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhat to know about Emmanuel Macron 01:32For more than two hours they sparred in the last chance to convince voters ahead of Sunday's election that they are qualified to lead a nation, which has become increasingly fractured over the current government's inability to cope with concerns around immigration, integration and an ailing economy.In the end, 63% of those who participated in survey after the debate found Macron more convincing than Le Pen, according to pollster Elabe, which provided results for CNN affiliate BFMTV.Read MoreLots of accusations, little moderationThe candidates sat across from each other at the Paris event -- often speaking over each other as moderators tried unsuccessfully to interrupt them. All night, Le Pen portrayed her opponent as out of touch and elitist. Macron dismissed his rival as a divisive figure with no political platform beyond her extremist views.  At one point, Le Pen chastised her younger opponent.\"Don't play with me,\" she said. \"Don't play teacher and pupil. It's not my thing.\"  Macron, she said, was the candidate of corporate interests.\"You defend private interests,\" she said. Macron accused Le Pen of lacking a strategy to turn the economy around. \"We must give our small and medium-sized enterprises the opportunity to create more jobs,\" Macron said. He added, \"Your strategy is simply to say a lot of lies and say everything that is wrong.\"Terrorism among hot topicsThe candidates traded barbs on the highly charged issue of terrorism. Le Pen accused Macron of lacking firmness and of being \"indulgent against Islamic terrorism.\" She vowed to immediately expel all foreigners identified on a terror watch list and to strip people suspected of Islamic extremism of their French nationality.  \"We have to make sure the territory is protected,\" she said. \"That is something I would do immediately once in power.\"She added, \"We have to eradicate ideology of Islamism in France.\"  JUST WATCHEDWho is Marine Le Pen?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWho is Marine Le Pen? 01:47Macron said the fight against terrorism would be his first priority, which he would address by increasing the resources of police and security forces and strengthening the enforcement of watch lists \"even if it deprives people of some of their freedoms.\" \"Putting everyone in prison or sending them abroad does not make any sense to me,\" he said.  Debate covers ties to Europe, US, RussiaAn anti-European Union, anti-NATO candidate, Le Pen has previously pushed for closer ties with Russia and has said she would drop the sanctions imposed on Moscow by the EU.Macron, a pro-EU, pro-integration politician, favors closer ties with Europe and has said France should do more to solve the migrant crisis. On Wednesday night, they voiced divergent views on diplomatic relations with Russia and the United States. Le Pen called Russia a \"great nation\" and said there is \"no reason to wage Cold War\" again. \"I think we need to keep our distance from both Russia and US,\" she said.Macron expressed his willingness to work with both on issues such as the Syria conflict.\"I will not accept to have my behavior dictated by Mr. Putin, and that's the difference with Mrs. Le Pen,\" he said. \"We will not submit to Russia or Mr. Putin's values, as they are not the same values as ours.\"He called the United States a working partner on a number of regional issues. Macron used the night to attack Le Pen's far-right National Front Party, which he said promoted hatred and \"generously dispenses brutality everywhere. \"Polls suggest Macron will triumph in the election, but the specter of a mass voting boycott remains.The debate marked the first time a French presidential runoff candidate has accepted an invitation to debate a far-right opponent. In 2002, Le Pen's father and founder of the National Front, was denied the opportunity to debate Jacques Chirac after the eventual president refused to appear on stage with him, citing his opponent's extremist views.If successful, Macron would become the youngest ever president of France.How in touch are they with voters?Most had expected that Le Pen, a former lawyer, would shine in the debates, yet, it has been Macron, the lesser experienced of the two, who has outshone his opponent in larger format events to date.French election: Is it Emmanuel Macron's to lose?Macron, at 39, if successful would become the youngest president in the history of France and the nation's youngest leader since Napoleon.Many see him as a millionaire, former investment banker and economy minister, who remains very much part of the \"elite.\" They are unsure as to how Macron will actually govern given he is not backed by a political party.He has struggled to connect with those living in rural France and the former industrialized areas which are now suffering with high unemployment.Both Macron and Le Pen will be attempting to persuade the seven million or so voters who backed Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon in the first round. The far-left firebrand has so far refused to endorse either candidate.French election: Related contentIs this Macron's election to lose?Why Putin and Trump both like Le PenMacron vs. Le Pen: What do they stand for?

What the first round results showed is that she needs to reach out and perhaps play down more extreme parts of her campaign.She has toned down the prospect of \"Frexit\" -- France's departure from the European Union -- and has also courted the voters of failed Republican candidate Francois Fillon.Le Pen  smiles with people in front of the Whirlpool factory in Amiens, northern France.On Tuesday, she gave a speech, which drew accusations of plagiarism. Her camp defended it saying it was \"a nod to Fillon\" rather than Le Pen ripping him off, but she can ill afford any further slip-ups.She has also been outspoken on immigration, insisting she would curb migration to a net 10,000 people a year. Her stance contrasts markedly with Macron, a pro-EU, pro-integration politician, who wants closer ties with Europe and has said France should do more to solve the migrant crisis. The debate will take in 10 different areas of policy including the economy, security and Europe.Head to head: How Le Pen and Macron compareCNN's Sebastian Shukla in London and Saskya Vandoorne in Paris contributed to this report.",

The Spaniard was upbeat after the test, but admitted that there is still much to learn. \"I am very excited about the race but now that I've tested the car I'm much more focused on work,\" Alonso said in a post-test press conference.  \"There are so many technical things to go through with the guys so all the emotional aspect (about the race) is a second priority now.\" How do you rate Fernando Alonso's chances of winning the #Indy500?

Alonso is aiming to become the 11th F1 driver to win the Indy 500 following in the footsteps of former world champions Jim Clark and Graham Hill -- winners in 1965 and 1966 respectively -- and the 1995 champion Jacques Villeneuve. Another ex-F1 driver, American Alexander Rossi, who raced five times for the Manor Marussia team in 2015, won the Indy 500 as a rookie 12 months ago. Alonso has been starved of F1 success in recent seasons -- his last victory came at the 2013 Spanish Grand Prix for his former team Ferrari. The 35-year-old has endured a miserable run of results since rejoining McLaren in 2015 as the once-mighty British team struggle for reliability and performance from its Honda engine.",

        "content": "London (CNN)Prince Philip, the longest-serving consort of a reigning British monarch, will retire from public engagements this autumn. The 95-year-old husband of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II has held a plethora of official titles throughout his life, but in the British media he's earned the unofficial moniker of \"Prince of Gaffes.\"The Prince himself has noted his expertise in \"dontopedalogy  -- the science of opening your mouth and putting your foot in it.\" It is, he says, something he has \"practiced for a good many years.\"Here are some of his more memorable moments:Read MoreDuring a royal visit to China in 1986, Philip described Beijing as \"ghastly\" and told British students: \"If you stay here much longer you'll all be slitty-eyed.\" He also quipped: \"If it has four legs and is not a chair, has wings and is not an aeroplane, or swims and is not a submarine, the Cantonese will eat it.\" Queen Elizabeth ll and Prince Philip visit The Great Wall of China in 1986.In 1995, Philip took up a British stereotype that Scots enjoy a drink or two, to ask a Scottish driving instructor: \"How do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to pass the test?\"In 1996, he was interviewed on BBC radio as the UK government was about to ban ownership of handguns bigger than a .22 caliber. The measure followed the school massacre in Dunblane, Scotland, in which 16 children were killed. He expressed his sympathy to victims' families but questioned the planned restriction: \"If a cricketer, for instance, suddenly decided to go into a school and batter a lot of people to death with a cricket bat, which he could do very easily ... I mean are you going to ban cricket bats?\"During a 1998 official visit to a British student who had been trekking in Papua New Guinea, Prince Philip asked: \"You managed not to get eaten, then?\" in an apparent reference to the historic belief that cannibalism had been practiced on the South Pacific islands. In 2002, he shocked a Bangladeshi teenager at a London youth club by saying the 14-year-old \"looks as if he is on drugs.\" The same year, Philip reportedly asked British Indian Labor MP Parmjit Dhanda -- a former student and trade union official -- what he did before becoming a politician, and then commenting: \"So you didn't do anything then.\" Also in 2002, he is reported to have asked Australian Aborigines: \"Do you still throw spears at each other?\" Prince Philip toasts then Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo in  Abuja, Nigeria in 2003.In 2003, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip went to open the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Abuja, Nigeria.

        "content": "Paris (CNN)Millions of viewers are expected to tune in Wednesday night to see independent centrist Emmanuel Macron battle far-right nationalist Marine Le Pen in the only televised head to head debate of the election.It's the last chance for either candidate to convince voters ahead of Sunday's election that they are qualified to lead a nation, which has become increasingly fractured over the current government's inability to cope with concerns around immigration, integration and an ailing economy.Polls suggest Macron will triumph in the election, but the specter of a mass voting boycott remains and it's something both candidates are desperate to address.Difficult testThe debate marks the first time a French presidential runoff candidate has accepted an invitation to debate a far-right opponent. Read MoreIn 2002, Le Pen's father and founder of the National Front, was denied the opportunity to debate Jacques Chirac after the eventual president refused to appear on stage with him, citing his opponent's extremist views.Macron is instead seeking to undo Le Pen's arguments one by one on air.If successful, Macron would become the youngest ever president of France.Most had expected that Le Pen, a former lawyer, would shine in the debates, yet, it has been Macron, the lesser experienced of the two, who has outshone his opponent in larger format events to date.French election: Is it Emmanuel Macron's to lose?Wednesday's debate will be his most difficult test yet. It will require him to keep his cool in what is likely to be a barrage of criticism from Le Pen.Both Macron and Le Pen will be attempting to persuade the seven million or so voters who backed Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon in the first round. The far-left firebrand has so far refused to endorse either candidate.Many see Macron as a millionaire, former investment banker and economy minister, who remains very much part of the \"elite.\"They are unsure as to how he will actually govern given he is not backed by a political party; critics also point out his lack of experience.Le Pen's challengeHowever there are plenty of people who say they could never vote for Le Pen and since the conclusion of the first round of voting, she has been attempting to widen her appeal.French election: Related contentIs this Macron's election to lose?Why Putin and Trump both like Le PenMacron vs. Le Pen: What do they stand for? Why you should care about the French election Fears of Russian meddling in French electionMacron: I'll avoid Clinton mistakeMarine Le Pen: The person behind the partyFrench election turns dirtyThe problems facing France's next presidentLast month, she announced that she had temporarily stepped down as leader of the National Front, painting herself as an independent candidate.What the first round results showed is that she needs to reach out and perhaps play down more extreme parts of her campaign.She has toned down the prospect of \"Frexit\" -- France's departure from the European Union -- and has also courted the voters of failed Republican candidate Francois Fillon.On Tuesday, she gave a speech, which drew accusations of plagiarism. Her camp defended it saying it was \"a nod to Fillon\" rather than Le Pen ripping him off, but she can ill afford any further slip-ups.Perhaps her biggest challenge will be coming across as cool and calm and resisting the temptation to go after Macron.Related: Macron, Le Pen, or neither? There is no love lost between the two. Last week, when asked what she admired about her opponent, Le Pen commented: \"Nothing. Absolutely nothing.\"Pressure points for bothThe debate will take in 10 different areas of policy including the economy, security and Europe.Macron's weak spot is his lack of parliamentary machinery. Le Pen is almost certain to attack him on the subject, especially as she has confirmed that her prime minister would be DuPont Aignan, the right-wing leader of the \"Stand up for France\" party.Le Pen  smiles with people in front of the Whirlpool factory in Amiens, northern France.She will also aim to expose the lack of clarity in his campaign. Head to head: How Le Pen and Macron compareLe Pen will be attacked over Europe and her apparent flip-flopping.And she is likely to be tackled on the subject of anti-Semitism after her campaign was hit by allegations of Holocaust denialFinal chanceOn Wednesday night, Macron needs to present himself as a president would, keep his cool, and not be drawn into a situation where he could lose his temper.Le Pen is expected use the opportunity to ask the electorate to believe her claim that she has moved away from the far-right rhetoric of her father and become more mainstream.For many, such an ask will be a step too far. And so, with just four days to go, this will be her final chance to change perceptions and perhaps make this race far more uncomfortable for Macron than many were expecting.CNN's  James Masters contributed to this report from London.",

We have discussed that and as far as I understand the US administration is supporting that idea,\" Putin said, following talks with Erdogan in the Russian resort town of Sochi. Erdogan said that a new conflict-free zone would be set up in the Idlib area. Such zones are meant to be areas where civilians can live without being targeted by any party in Syria's war. Putin and US President Donald Trump had their first phone conversation Tuesday since Trump ordered missile strikes against a Syrian air base last month. The US strikes were in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack on a rebel-held Syrian town that was widely blamed on the Syrian regime. Trump and Putin discussed Trump's proposal to create safe zones, according to a White House readout of their call. They also agreed that \"the suffering in Syria has gone on for far too long and that all parties must do all they can to end the violence.\" Read MoreOpposition cite ceasefire violationsParticipants in a new round of Syrian ceasefire talks in Astana, Kazakhstan have discussed the memorandum on de-escalation zones in Syria, Kazakh Foreign Ministry official Aidarbek Tumatov said on Wednesday, according to Russian state news agency TASS.

But in recent months, the two leaders have shown greater unity as they've emerged as significant powers in the Syrian conflict. Turkey also is increasingly looking to Russia as an ally as Ankara's relations with the West worsen.The Kremlin has worked closely with Erdogan to negotiate ceasefires and bring about a potential diplomatic solution to the Syria conflict, despite the two countries holding very different ideas on the future role of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and differing priorities on the ground.

Erdogan's focus, meanwhile, is on promoting Turkey's interests in Syria, if possible at the expense of the Kurds, and on securing a role in the offensive against Raqqa, the ISIS stronghold in Syria.

        "content": "London (CNN)It was the dinner date from hell, and the fallout has lasted for days. Devastating accounts of a meeting last week between British Prime Minister Theresa May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker sent Downing Street into a tailspin from which it has struggled to recover.The encounter -- intended to pave the way for formal Brexit talks later -- went \"badly,\" the EU side said. British officials were in a \"different galaxy.\" Juncker was so aghast that he called German Chancellor Angela Merkel at 7:30am the next morning. May, an anti-spin politician used to conducting such discussions with discretion, was floored.JUST WATCHEDTheresa May: The UK is leaving the EUReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTheresa May: The UK is leaving the EU 01:07The Prime Minister was still picking up the pieces on Tuesday. After initially dismissing the accounts as \"Brussels gossip,\" May tried another tack, telling the BBC that if the EU tried to play hardball, they would find her a \"bloody difficult woman\" -- recalling a Conservative Party colleague's hot-mic characterization that unintentionally boosted her credentials when she ran for the leadership of her party.The leak is more than just gossip, of course -- it shows two sides in a difficult negotiation process very far apart, with little sense of common ground. It suits the Prime Minister to try to rise above the leak, but by failing to deny outright the account, first reported by Politico Europe and then amplified by a full-page story in the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine, she has allowed it to stand as an authoritative version. Read MoreDirty fightOne lesson to be drawn from the row is that EU officials are prepared to fight dirty as the Brexit process gets underway. It is a very different kind of diplomacy and the response from Downing Street raises  the question whether May is prepared to fight just as dirty to get what she wants.The account in Frankfurter Allgemeine was so detailed it can only have been authorized by senior EU officials close to Juncker, suggesting that the commission president's circle had its gloves off before he arrived in Downing Street last Wednesday. The way Juncker telephoned  Merkel the next morning fueled the sense that, to copy a phrase used by the British prime minister last month, the rest of the EU is \"ganging up\" on Britain. A few hours later, Merkel issued a stern warning against UK \"illusions\" over Brexit.President of the European Union Jean-Claude Juncker and British Prime Minister Theresa May walk between photo calls at a summit in Malta in February.There were rumors in Brussels that the European Council, which sets overall EU strategy and is led by Donald Tusk, were unhappy with the commission over the hostile briefing operation because it undermines trust in a delicate negotiating process. EU sources also suggested that the German Chancellor herself is not pleased at being dragged into the row by featuring so prominently in the leaked account. Fingers were being pointed at Martin Selmayr, Juncker's bruising chief of staff, as being behind the leak.EU leaders finalize Brexit position before UK talksThe account may undermine the trust between the two sides, but it served a useful purpose, according to Fabian Zuleeg, chief executive of the Brussels-based European Policy Centre. He said: \"I think it was entirely to highlight how far apart the positions are between the two sides and that there is still a lot of disillusion on the British side.\"We don't know for sure who leaked, but ... one of the comments from Juncker that she is in a 'different galaxy' was an attempt to express how difficult those negotiations will be.\"\"It is not particularly surprising that there was a leak. There is a clear difference in understanding between the two sides of how this process is going to work and what it will imply. For me that suggests there is a very good chance that we will end up with no deal at all.\"EU officials were particularly taken aback at the refusal of May to accept that talks about a British-EU trade deal could not start until the so-called \"divorce\" bill was settled -- something at odds with her more conciliatory tone when she triggered Article 50.European Council President Donald Tusk (R) was said to have been dismayed at the reports.Charles Grant, the director of the Centre for European Reform, said the substance of last Wednesday's meeting was more important than the nature of the leak \"because to quote the German government, they [the British government] appear to be deluded on a range  of the issues\". He added: \"When Theresa May issued her Article 50 letter it suggested that she was adopting a more realistic approach about the painful truths of Brexit, but this suggests that May has gone off that.\"Grant said that Juncker's reported comment that \"Brexit cannot be a success\" may not have been very diplomatic but he was reflecting the position of the EU27 and the German government, which was that Britain must not be as prosperous outside the EU as it was inside it. He said: \"It was a policy position. It wasn't very diplomatic but he was trying to bring the British back to reality as they are out of touch with reality on all of those issues.\"May on the back footWhen she was Home Secretary in David Cameron's government, May was used to getting her own way. And in Brussels, there is a history of British prime ministers driving a hard bargain to get what they want: Margaret Thatcher secured a rebate for the UK from the EU, Tony Blair refused to sign up his country to the single currency. But back then, Britain had a stronger negotiating position because it was inside the bloc -- now, as it prepares to leave Europe, its hand is weak because it has no trump card. It has nothing to trade.JUST WATCHEDBrexit: What happens after Article 50?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBrexit: What happens after Article 50? 01:29Amid the fallout, May seems to be on the back foot. But some in May's Conservative Party believe it will suit the Prime Minister to be portrayed as \"in a different galaxy\" to the EU because it showed she was refusing to back down on the request of the British people to withdraw from the EU. It will certainly delight hardline Euroskeptics in the Conservative Party who would prefer no deal at all to a \"bad deal.\"Zuleeg echoed this view, saying the report of the dinner would be politically beneficial to May in the run-up to next month's general election. He said: \"Will this damage the size of her election victory? Probably not. In some ways it is convenient to portray her as the sole leader standing against the EU, the single fighter against the bureaucracy of other countries ganging up against Britain. In that sense there is no damage.\" \"Has it been damaging in terms of negotiating a deal -- to some extent, yes. But the one question for achieving a deal is whether Theresa May is willing to compromise on the very difficult red lines she has set out. If she is not willing to compromise on those then a deal looks quite unlikely.\"",

The French magazine Closer is separate from the UK's Closer magazine.The images showed the duchess sunbathing topless while on holiday in the South of France in 2012 in the couple's private villa. They scandalized St. James Palace and dredged up memories of the royal family's rocky relationship with the media 15 years after the death of William's mother, Princess Diana, as she fled photographers in Paris.The tribunal de Nanterre is hosting the trial related to the paparazzi photos of topless Duchess of Cambridge.\"The incident is reminiscent of the worst excesses of the press and paparazzi during the life of Diana, Princess of Wales, and all the more upsetting to The Duke and Duchess for being so,\" a palace spokesman said in 2012.According to the Press Association, Ernesto Mauri, chief executive of the publishing group that produces Closer, faces one charge of using a document obtained by a breach of privacy, along with Marc Auburtin, La Provence's publishing director at the time. Laurence Pieau, editor of Closer magazine, is charged with complicity.

        "content": "Bordeaux, France (CNN)French voters have two choices in Sunday's presidential election, far right candidate Marine Le Pen or independent centrist Emmanuel Macron, but with days to go until the ballot a third option is gaining momentum -- sitting out the election entirely. A campaign is urging voters to stay at home, leave their ballot envelope empty or submit a blank piece of paper instead of a ballot slip.Hashtags such as #SansMoiLe7Mai (without me on May 7), #NiPatrieNiPatron (neither country, nor boss) and #NiMarineNiMacron (neither Marine, nor Macron) have emerged on social media platforms.A woman in Bordeaux reads posters urging voters not to turn out this weekend.Official government figures show more people decided to abstain from voting in the April 23 first round of the French presidential election than voted for any single candidate -- including Macron and National Front's Le Pen. And while many leading politicians from left and right have thrown their support behind Macron ahead of Sunday's vote, far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon has refused to do the same. That raises the question: what effect will a high abstention level have on the result?Read MoreREAD MORE: How Macron and Le Pen compareA survey of Melenchon's far-left La France Insoumise (France Unbowed) coalition released this week found that 36% of its supporters want to leave their ballots blank, while 29% don't want to vote at all. The survey didn't include the option of voting for Le Pen.The latest polls suggest Macron is comfortably leading Le Pen by about 60% to 40% -- but many of those who plan to vote for Macron say they are doing it to stop her, rather than to support him.'Neither will do anything for me'\"I backed Melenchon in the first round, but the two candidates who are left aren't mine,\" said Paris taxi driver Abdel, who declined to give CNN his second name.\"Macron wants to sell France off, and Le Pen wants to get rid of the immigrants -- and I'm an immigrant.\"Stall holder Patrice said he'd vote 'blanc' on Sunday.In Bordeaux, a market stall holder said Macron is the same as the current French President Francois Hollande. \"I'm voting, but I'm voting 'blanc,'\" Patrice Mounnier said.  \"He's all about the banks and finance, not for the middle class.\"Le Pen says nice things for the little guys, but I don't want to leave Europe or the euro,\" he said, adding that he also objected to Le Pen's views on Muslims.Bordeaux coffee stall owner Anne-Marie (who also declined to give her second name) said she too would vote \"blanc\" leaving her ballot envelope empty in the final round. \"I voted for Melenchon,\" she said about the first round. \"Macron, Le Pen, they're the same thing, and neither will do anything for me.\"READ MORE: Is it Macron's election to lose?'The current system... does not benefit the working class'At a trade union rally in Paris, an activist for the \"Voice of the Proletariat\" group said his \"comrades\" were divided over what to do on Sunday.\"Some of them will hold their nose and vote for Macron,\" he said, \"but it's 50/50 -- the other half won't vote at all, they will find it too difficult to vote for him, because of his links to bankers.\"Boycott 2017 badges at a rally in Paris. Boycott 2017 is calling on voters to back neither candidate.Voting legitimizes an anti-democratic system, according to Jeremy, a campaigner for the Boycott 2017 group, who declined to give his second name. \"The current system is not democratic -- it's a bourgeois dictatorship that does not benefit the working class.\"However Jeremy said he was concerned that Le Pen could benefit if voters abstain. \"I don't think she will [win]. If she does, though, the struggle will continue.\"Will it change the outcome?In 2002, when Le Pen's father, National Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, made it through to the second round against Jacques Chirac, voters from across the political spectrum united around the opposing Republican candidate, handing him a landslide win. In that contest, some 20% of voters abstained.Matthew Goodwin, visiting senior fellow at London-based think tank Chatham House, said high abstention levels could hit Macron's hopes of a comprehensive victory over Le Pen.\"Macron will be hoping for a 2002-style bump in turnout against Le Pen, but it is clear that this might not materialize to the same extent,\" he said. \"In 2002, lots of trade unions mobilized against Le Pen, only two have this time, and... left-wing voters appear to be saying they will abstain in larger numbers,\" he added.\"The numbers suggest that Le Pen will still struggle to win, but it is clear that over the long term, she is doing much better than her father.\"James Masters contributed to this story from London.",

        "content": "Story highlightsMerkel's trip to Russia comes as Berlin-Moscow relations at a lowThe pair discussed Syria and Ukraine, along with reports of a crackdown on gay men in Chechnya (CNN)German Chancellor Angela Merkel has raised reports of the detention and abuse of gay men in Chechnya with Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging the leader to protect the rights of minorities across the country. The first report on the issue was published on April 1 by the major Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, which claimed that more than 100 men had been detained or disappeared in Chechnya on suspicion of being homosexual, and that some of them had been killed.Gay Chechen men tell of torture, mass arrestsA number of witnesses and victims gave CNN horrific accounts of torture, saying that hundreds of gay men were being rounded up by authorities and held in appalling conditions in least three detention centers.\"We've heard some very negative reports about how homosexuals are treated in Chechnya, and I asked Mr. Putin to use his influence to ensure the rights of such minorities,\" Merkel told reporters after meeting with Putin in the Russian city of Sochi.Chechnya is one of several semi-autonomous republics within Russia.Read MoreBeing gay is considered by many in the Muslim-majority republic to be shameful, and in Chechnya the practice of so-called honor killings -- murder by family members to expunge shame -- is widespread.In April a Chechen government spokesman called the allegations of a crackdown \"an absolute lie,\" and denied that gay men exist in the republic.Putin: US election meddling 'nothing but rumors'Merkel also stressed the importance of civil rights to Putin, including the right to demonstrate and the right for NGOs to operate freely. Russia has passed a series of laws in recent years that has made protesting nearly impossible and has clamped down on NGOs that voice opposition to the Kremlin or that receive foreign funding.Merkel (L) with Putin at the Bocharov Ruchei residence in Sochi on Tuesday. Putin was also asked by a reporter for his response to a spate of attacks on Russian opposition figures in recent weeks. Putin's main political opponent, Alexey Navalny, was reportedly hit in an acid attack this week, as were several other activists. Putin responded by saying that law enforcement agencies were working within the law and that victims had access to the justice system.\"The law enforcement agencies in Russia are acting in a much more mitigated way than many of our partners in Western Europe.\" He also shot down allegations of Russian interference in the US and European elections.There have been concerns of Russian meddling in upcoming European polls, including the French vote on Sunday and Germany's election in September. \"We never interfere in the political processes of other countries, and we would very much appreciate it if no one interfered in our political life. Unfortunately, for many years we have seen the opposite: Influence on political processes in Russia, through so-called non-governmental organizations and directly,\" he said in response to a reporter's questions, without giving specific examples.  \"You referred to the example of the United States, which has not been confirmed by anyone and is nothing but rumors used in a domestic political struggle in the United States.\"Ukraine and sanctionsThe leaders did not speak explicitly about sanctions at the press conference after their meeting, but they both said they were committed to the Minsk agreements aimed at bringing an end to the Ukraine crisis, despite slow progress.Merkel has openly backed the European Union's decision to place sanctions on Russia following Moscow's annexation of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. She has been the lead mediator in talks with Russia over Crimea. A pro-Russia rebel patrols a neighborhood near the central railway station in Donetsk, Ukraine in 2014.The agreements involve a ceasefire, and pulling weapons and pro-Russian forces out of the area. They were brokered by Merkel and French President Francois Hollade. The EU sanctions -- as well as US sanctions -- on Russia have been a thorn in the Kremlin's side. Moscow has lobbied world leaders to drop the restrictions that have taken a toll on the country's economy, already sluggish on low oil prices.Gernot Erler, Germany's top Russia policy official, said earlier that Merkel would reiterate Berlin's position that sanctions against Russia could be lifted swiftly if Moscow adhered to the Minsk agreements, according to the Berliner Zeitung newspaper.Merkel conceded that the political process had been slow, but brushed off suggestions by reporters that it should be scrapped and replaced with a new instrument.\"Our objective is that Ukraine will get access to its own border, but before that, a ceasefire then a political solution should be found,\" she said.\"We need implementation and (some) sides need to step up.\" Merkel and Putin split on SyriaJUST WATCHEDWho are Putin's allies?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWho are Putin's allies? 01:40The two leaders also discussed the Middle East -- their governments stand on opposing sides of the Syrian war. Putin is the most powerful ally of embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while Merkel has openly called for Assad's ouster.Erler, the German official, acknowledged earlier that a peace deal for Syria was no longer possible without Russia, which he described as \"the savior of Assad.\"He suggested that Merkel might push Putin to allow other foreign countries to take part in future negotiations.Russia is currently holding ceasefire talks with warring factions in Syria's war. It is working only with Turkey and Iran on the deal.  \"We have to acknowledge that all previous peace efforts have failed. The UN Special Envoy, Staffan de Mistura, has not made any progress. But also the ceasefire talks initiated by Russia have not led to any tangible results,\" Erler told Berliner Zeitung.Diplomatic thaw?Merkel's trip comes as Berlin-Moscow relations remain stuck at a low over the Ukraine crisis and Syrian war. But the visit to Russia -- Merkel's first in two years -- appears to mark a thaw in relations.Putin and Merkel, both stalwart leaders in their countries, have kept regular communications open over the years. Both speak each other's language and have overseen periods of expanded Russian-German trade relations.Putin (R) pats his dog Koni in Merkel's presence, in Sochi on January 21, 2007.But that closeness didn't come immediately.

Twenty-four Russians and three Thais were hurt, with some suffering serious fractures and bruising, when the plane unexpectedly hit an \"air hole\" during its approach to Suvarnabhumi Airport, according to the statement from Russian Embassy in Bangkok. \"Some injured passengers were not wearing seat belts. All victims were taken to a local hospital with various injuries, mostly fractures and bruises. Some require surgery. Fifteen people remain hospitalized,\" the embassy said.The Airport Authority of Thailand said in a press release that 30 passengers had been injured during the flight, with 27 individuals transferred to Samitivej Srinakarin hospital in Bangkok, while three chose to seek their own treatment. It added that the Boeing 777 was traveling with 318 passengers and 14 crew and that it was struck with turbulence as it flew over Myanmar. Read More'Blood on the ceiling'Rostik Rusev, who is from Ukraine but lives in Hackensack, New Jersey, was on the flight and told CNN the turbulence was so bad it threw passengers out of their seats.\"It lasted for about 10 seconds, the plane was being thrown everywhere,\" Rusev told CNN.    3 hours ago I was on a Plane going From Moscow to Bangkok, out of nowhere we hit turbulence, that was so bad that it was throwing people around like crazy. Blood everywhere, people with broken bones, noses, open fractures, baby's with head injuries, I can keep going and going. Thank God we are Alive! I really hope @aeroflot @aeroflotrus will do right by everybody! I can honestly say I have never been so scared in my life before. #aeroflot #emergency.  we are ok! A post shared by Rostik Rusev (@krlrgstk) on Apr 30, 2017 at 9:42pm PDT\n\"There was blood on the ceiling, people with broken noses, babies who were hurt. It was horrible. It came out of nowhere. It was like driving a car and a tire suddenly bursts.\"The aircraft personnel couldn't have been more professional and courageous. They were heroes in everything they were doing.\"Rusev also provided CNN with a photograph showing blood on an overhead compartment, which, he says, was the result of people being thrown out of their seats and hitting the ceiling.A passenger provided CNN with this photo of blood on one of the overhead compartments.An \"air hole\" is an area of low pressure air where there differential causes the plane to drop, according to Richard Quest, CNN's airline and aviation correspondent. He said it can also be the result of air currents shifting, crossing the jet stream or storms in the area. However, Quest said \"air holes\" are not dangerous to the aircraft -- only those who aren't wearing seat belts when the plane travels through the air pockets. 'There were broken legs, arms, bruised faces' Another passenger, Margarita Vladimir, told CNN that the journey had been mostly peaceful, but as passengers were visiting the toilet and preparing for landing, the turbulence erupted. \"We saw so many people getting seriously hurt. There were broken legs, arms, bruised faces,\" she said.In a video she provided to CNN, the aftermath could be seen. One passenger had fallen to the floor and was being comforted by a passenger seated across the aisle. Others on the flight looked disorientated. As the footage panned to the galley, a man could be seen propped up against the emergency door with a gash to his head. Vladimir said that she suffered only scratches and bruises on her arms and shoulder but her child was hit in the head so they were taken to the hospital for assessment. She says they've been given the all clear but that there are still people from the flight who remain at the medical facility.Aeroflot issued a statement explaining the circumstances surrounding the incident, which occurred about 40 minutes before landing, saying that this type of turbulence known as \"clear sky turbulence\" is difficult to prepare for as \"it does not occur in clouds but in clear skies with good visibility.\"The flight operator cited this as the reason passengers were not warned to return to their seats before adding that around 750 cases of clear sky turbulence occur  globally each year. Russian officials were at hospitals in the Thai capital providing translation and counseling assistance. CNN's Tomas Etzler in Moscow contributed to this report.",

Whether it be your husband, wife, brother, sister, parent, coworker, friend, or acquaintance, you definitely know someone.And that person talks about it. A lot. Follow @cnnsport\n\nToo much? Definitely too much. And now you're reading about it? It's all too much.JUST WATCHEDKuwait joins the crossfit crazeReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHKuwait joins the crossfit craze 03:59The fact you've read this far means that you are at least mildly curious about this fitness craze and the unwavering obsession it commands, in which case there are some things that will help you to understand this person you once thought you knew so well, but now talks only of muscle-ups, double-unders and WODs. Who is this person? What are they talking about? What have they become? Read MoreThe first thing to understand is that by signing up for CrossFit, your friend has made a costly and heavily time consuming commitment towards positive improvements, and with that comes a real sense of achievement. That alone should make you happy too, right? That's how it works. The second, and perhaps most important thing to understand is that they are learning new things on a near-daily basis. CrossFit is highly technical, using many gymnastic and Olympic weightlifting techniques which very few people will have ever done before.

He was joined on the podium by Mathew Fraser, left, and Jason Khalipa. Hide Caption 7 of 7Achieving your first handstand push-up, kipping pull-up or double-under (What do these things mean? Ask your friend) is really difficult and truly exciting once you get it.When you do, you're going to want to tell someone. Just as you did when you were a kid and you hit your first home run or scored your first goal in soccer. So, cut your friend some slack. They know they're talking about this all the time. But this is big for them.Don't mention the 'i' wordSo, now you've accepted that talking CrossFit is something you do now, it's probably best to know what to say to this particular friend-turned-cult member.One good rule of thumb is not to immediately bring up potential injuries. The disturbing statistic behind the '22 Pushup Challenge' While injuries are always possible, CrossFit's obsession with safety borders on the tedious. Most gyms require several weeks of beginner classes, teaching you how to safely pick things up, jump on things and carry things before you're ever let loose on a class.Once you have graduated from your starter course, you'll find yourself repeatedly practicing moves with weightless pipes or empty bars before ever attempting to lift heavy weights. Do you know what is dangerous? Every sport ever invented.Do you know a soccer player who's torn their ACL, or tennis players who has sprained, strained or broken their ankle? You have, right? Have you ever suffered from I-T Band syndrome after running? I have. It's agony.JUST WATCHEDThe world's most dangerous workout?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe world's most dangerous workout? 02:41Sport is fundamentally dangerous, but these dangers can be mitigated when performed in controlled environments where trained professionals are regulating your performances. Places such as CrossFit.The large misconception about CrossFit is born from youtube videos of guys lifting crazy-heavy weights and dropping them on their neck, back, etc.While weight-related injuries are real and are frightening, these incidents are not indicative of CrossFit, and I'm willing to bet did not takes place in a box (What's a Box? Ask ... you know the rest).Simply put, don't make assumptions.Crazy meatheads I cannot stress how often I hear: \"I can't imagine you working out with all those crazy meatheads.\" Yeah, me neither. I don't. I can't. I wouldn't try. Or, \"I can't do that!\" Oh really, because one lady in my class is approaching 80. And she can, and does.JUST WATCHED'CrossFitter' pushes sport's limitReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'CrossFitter' pushes sport's limit 01:03The CrossFit community is a broad based mishmash of people of all ages, sizes and backgrounds, and this is what makes it special.It's a community, all working together to help each other improve. Once the elite members of a group finish working out, they will help encourage the slower and weaker members of the class. This seems to be universal. When you're out of town, you can \"drop-in\" at a local box and feel totally welcome. You'll even leave with a t-shirt branded with the local affiliates logo.These things are a great commodity in the CrossFit cult. One girl at our box has a \"CrossFit Reykjavik\" T-shirt. How cool is that?In essence, CrossFit is to the gym, what supper club is to eating alone. It's just better with friends.\"The Open\"If you've made it this far, you're clearly ready to take your conversations with your CrossFit buddy to the next level.So, if you really want to impress your friend and make their day, I have one piece of advice: Ask about \"the Open.\"JUST WATCHEDMan severs spine in freak accidentReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMan severs spine in freak accident 01:19The Open is an annual five week global competition that your friend/coworker is either participating in, judging, or actively watching his/her CrossFit friends participate in.Either way, they are talking about it. A lot. If they're not talking about it, they're thinking about it, and really want to talk about it. During the Open, many boxes host weekly events, where participants all compete together, with food and drinks on tap, creating an inviting family-friendly environment where you can watch your friends all but kill themselves in order to post and score among the hundreds of thousands of others on the global leaderboard.It's fun, and something your friend would delight in explaining to you.For the truly elite CrossFitter, the Open is merely a qualifying stage towards the regionals or, ultimately, \"The Games.\" But you don't need to know about this. You don't know anyone who's going to regionals or the Games. These people are a myth.",

That's a whole new level of cool. A collection of actors, athletes, entertainers and other celebrities offered birthday greetings on Twitter to one young boy from Leeds, England. Chris Hope-Smith, the boy's father,  tweeted a request for anyone famous to send his son Ollie a positive message on his 9th birthday. He wrote that Ollie had been bullied, saying he \"just would love someone to tell him he does mean something.\"Strange request.

It passed by 393 votes to 226, with four abstentions.The bill is likely to pass through the Bundesrat -- Germany's upper house -- next week. The Bundesrat has previously approved legalizing same-sex marriage. PHOTOS: Champagne corks pop in Berlin after voteSupporters of gay rights celebrate following the vote Friday at the nearby Bundestag.Once it has been officially signed into law, Germany will enter the club of more than 20 countries where same-sex marriage is legal.Read MoreTwo-thirds of Germans said they were in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage in a recent YouGov poll.     A crowd of same-sex marriage supporters who waited outside the parliament building as the vote was held cheered in celebration as the bill was passed, hailing a historic day for equal rights.Merkel votes noSpeaking after the vote, Merkel said she had voted no on the issue, but that it had been important to put it to a vote of conscience.Supporters of gay rights gathered outside the Chancellery to celebrate Friday. \"For me and the basic law, it's about the marriage of a woman and a man. That's why I voted against it,\" she said, adding that it had been an emotional debate for many in parliament, including herself.\"I hope that the vote today shows not only the mutual respect for different opinions but that this also leads to more peace and social cohesion as well,\" she said.Chancellor Angela Merkel and other lawmakers line up to vote on same-sex marriage.Martin Schulz, leader of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) -- the second largest party in parliament -- tweeted following the vote that \"progress is possible\" and said he was \"happy for all the married couples to-be.\" Progress is possible. As the 23rd country on earth, we now have marriage equality in Germany. I'm happy for all the married couples to-be.\u2014 Martin Schulz (@MartinSchulz) June 30, 2017\nSpeaking by Berlin's Brandenburg Gate, however, he cautioned that the law could still end up before the Federal Constitutional Court because some members of Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party view it as fundamentally unlawful and requiring a change to the constitution.The vote was welcomed by the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association in Europe, which suggested same-sex couples could be able to marry by the end of the year.  \"After years of waiting and hoping, rainbow families in Germany will now receive equal recognition under the law -- this is a historic milestone that can inspire even more change for LGBTI people,\" said ILGA-Europe executive director Evelyne Paradis.The German Foreign Office tweeted \"congratulations to all gay couples who have been waiting to get married!\"The German Parliament approved same-sex marriage.

Facing pressure on the issue from the leaders of other political parties, Merkel announced Monday that she would like to see parliament move towards a \"vote of conscience\" on same-sex marriage, kicking off a chain of events that culminated in Friday's vote.  The Chancellor made the comment at an event in Berlin hosted by women's magazine Brigitte, where she was asked by a gay man in the audience whether he would be able to refer to his partner as \"my husband.\" Merkel signaled a softening of her stance at an event Monday. \nMerkel responded by acknowledging the widespread support for gay marriage among German voters and suggesting a free vote in parliament, meaning lawmakers vote freely rather than being asked to support their parties' official positions.Her comments represented a significant shift for the German leader and for her conservative CDU party, which has long opposed same-sex marriage and promoted \"traditional\" family values. Some in its more conservative Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU) reacted angrily to news of the vote.Merkel under pressureBut with September's election looming, Merkel has come under increasing pressure, with her main rivals and potential coalition partners announcing support for \"Ehe f\u00fcr alle\" (marriage for all).Germany to quash convictions for homosexuality, pay compensationThe left-leaning Green party and the centrist FDP had both said that they would not enter into any coalition deal with Merkel if \"Ehe f\u00fcr alle\" was not enshrined in it. The left-leaning Die Linke party has long supported full equality.Friday was the last chance for parliament to vote on the issue before it breaks for the summer recess and election campaigning begins in earnest.The result was welcomed by many of the country's liberal politicians on Twitter.\"Today, our country is more free, more tolerant, and more modern,\" said FDP leader Christian Lindner.Unser Land ist heute freier, toleranter und moderner geworden. CL #ehefueralle #LoveisLove\u2014 Christian Lindner (@c_lindner) June 30, 2017\nGreen Party leader Cem \u00d6zdemir said the bill \"doesn't take away anything, gives everything,\" while Katja Kipping, chairwoman of Die Linke party, hailed its passage as a moment \"when many have the courage to finally decide on a matter of course.\" She added, \"Now it is time for more courage.\" Not all supported the step though. Frauke Petry, former chairwoman of the right-wing AFD party, tweeted that Merkel \"puts up marriage for auction on the altar of remaining in power. What did this country get into!\"Election tactic?Anja Neundorf, associate professor at the University of Nottingham, said she saw Merkel's change of stance as an election tactic designed to appeal to the average German voter -- but one that could backfire among traditional, religious CSU supporters in Bavaria. Merkel needs the support of those voters to win the election.Gay rights supporters celebrate on Friday.  CSU supporters \"are much more sensitive to this issue\" than other voters, Neundorf told CNN. And some might choose to simply stay at home on polling day, she said.\u00a0By legalizing gay marriage, Germany follows the path of many of its European neighbors, as well as countries around the world.\u00a0In 2001, the Netherlands became the first country to legalize same-sex marriage. More than 20 other nations have followed suit, including Spain, Canada, Argentina, France, the United Kingdom and the United States.CNN's Hilary McGann and Nick Thompson contributed to this report.",

Following his death, Murray told CNN her son had touched many people's lives. \"We get messages from all over the world and they often start with 'you don't know me, I've never met you or your son. However, I've been following him on social media, and he made me become more confident. He made me live life more fully,'\" she said.Murray was widely praised for saying she forgave her son's killer, Salman Abedi.

        "content": "Moscow (CNN)Five Chechen men have been found guilty in connection with the murder of Russian opposition figure Boris Nemtsov, according to Russian state news agency Tass.Nemtsov, a Putin critic who was deputy prime minister in the late 1990s under President Boris Yeltsin, was shot in the back in February 2015 while walking with his girlfriend in central Moscow near the Kremlin. The trial of the five men began in October 2016. It was heard by a jury at the request of the defendants, at Moscow Regional Military Court. Although most Russian trials are heard by a judge, a jury can be requested in cases of grave offenses such as murder. Nemtsov was a vocal critic of Putin. The five men were arrested in March 2015. A sixth suspect blew himself up after a standoff with police in Grozny, the Chechen capital, according to reports on state-run television at the time. Another suspect -- a former officer in the Chechen military called Ruslan Mukhudinov -- has been charged in absentia, according to Tass. Mukhudinov has been on the international wanted list since November 2015 and a criminal case against him is being investigated separately, Tass said.Read MoreVerdict criticizedAccused Shadid Gubashev stands inside a defendants' cage at a court hearing in Moscow on Tuesday.Investigators said forensic evidence found in the getaway car and telephone records linked the suspects to the crime. Four of the accused men, Anzor and Shadid Gubashev, Tamerlan Eskerkhanov and Khamzat Bakhayev, claimed their innocence throughout the case. The fifth, Zaur Dadayev, initially confessed to his role and that of the others in the crime, according to Natalia Mushnikova, the judge in the case, but later told human rights activists from Russia's federal watchdog, the Public Observation Commission, that he did so under torture and retracted his confession, according to reports from state news agency RIA Novosti.Zaur Dadayev (R), charged with masterminding and carrying out the killing of Boris Nemtsov, stands in court Tuesday.Sentencing is expected next week. The punishment for people convicted of murder ranges from eight years in prison up to life imprisonment, depending on the circumstances, according to Russia's Criminal Code. Nemtsov's daughter, Zhanna Nemtsova, criticized the verdict in a Facebook post, saying that \"the case remains unsolved.\"While five men have been convicted of her father's murder, investigators have not established who ordered the killing, she said. \"People in Russia and in the world are convinced of the political background to the murder, and our [the Russian] investigation and the court deny the obvious. Furthermore, they failed to establish any motive for murder. This just clearly shows the blatant falsity of our state,\" she wrote.JUST WATCHEDNemtsov's daughter: Russia has crossed a lineReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNemtsov's daughter: Russia has crossed a line 02:44Before the trial, investigators said the suspects were allegedly angered not by Nemtsov's opposition to the Kremlin, but by his support for murdered cartoonists who drew the Prophet Mohammed at the French magazine, Charlie Hebdo. The magazine was the scene of a massacre in January 2015.Related story: Russian protesters mark anniversary of Boris Nemtsov's death Mysterious deathsSeveral critics of President Vladimir Putin and the Russian government have been killed or injured in mysterious circumstances in recent years.They include Denis Voronenkov, a one-time member of Russia's lower house of parliament for the communist party, who died in March 2017 after being shot outside a hotel in Kiev.  The investigation into his killing continues; nobody has yet been charged.Vladimir Kara-Murza, an anti-Putin activist and friend of Nemtsov, has fallen into a coma twice in the past two years. Both times, his family said he had been poisoned. No criminal case has been opened in relation to the incident. In 2006, former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko died a slow death from poisoning in Britain. In a deathbed statement, he blamed Putin for ordering his poisoning with the rare radioactive substance polonium-210, saying it was slipped into his tea at a London hotel.A detailed UK inquiry later concluded that Putin probably approved the operation by Russian agents to kill Litvinenko.Also in 2006, Anna Politkovskaya, a journalist critical of the Kremlin and of Russia's war in Chechnya, was gunned down at the entrance to her Moscow apartment block. In 2014, a Moscow court sentenced five Chechen men to prison for their role in her murder. A sixth man, a former Russian police officer, had been jailed in a separate court case in 2012.Related story: 5 theories on Nemtsov killingCNN's Jill Dougherty, Emma Burrows and Mary Ilyushina reported from Moscow and Elizabeth Roberts wrote from London.",

His first Tour in charge began in London, this year's race starting in Germany.

It's a case in cycling, in other sports but other domains also.\"We still have to fight, and will carry on fighting.

It sees participants riding \"stick horses,\" as the Finns call them, often intricately made at home, and completing circuits similar to those used in equestrian -- with some fences as high as 1.2 meters.Read MoreWhile the obstacles and jumps no doubt offer an interesting alternative to conventional exercise, it's the sense of community that hobbyhorsing provides which really hooks the \"hobbyists.\"READ: Michelle Payne \"embarrassed and sorry\" for failed drugs test\"My favorite thing is the community,\" Elsa Salo, star of Hobbyhorse Revolution, says. \"I also like making horses and creating the personalities of the horses, sharing the horses with others and telling other hobbyists about them. \"The community is so tolerating and we accept everyone the way they are.\"As Elsa speaks, she fiddles with the reigns of what she says is her favorite hobbyhorse. His name is Trivoli. He's a German half-blood, she explains, is rarely flustered by anything and, importantly, jumps very well.\"I started riding (real) horses when I was six years old and I absolutely loved animals and I loved horses,\" she says.\"I rode horses for 10 years and I had this really dear horse to me, she was called Fiona. She passed away a few years ago and since then I haven't gone back to actual stables but my hobbyhorses have still been in my life and I love them.\"Trivoli is my favorite horse because he reminds of the horse Fiona.\" Photos: Hobbyhorse RevolutionHobbyhorsing is the latest equestrian trend sweeping Finland, a \"horse crazy\" nation.Hide Caption 1 of 13 Photos: Hobbyhorse RevolutionIt sees participants -- called \"hobbyists\" -- riding stick horses in events that mirror equestrian circuits and dressage.Hide Caption 2 of 13 Photos: Hobbyhorse RevolutionFor the most part, hobbyhorsing is seen as a fun pastime or an exciting new way to exercise.

We wanted to continue doing it and then we found the community.\"Elsa thinks the first real turning point in the revolution came 10 years after the pair stumbled across her mum's old hobbyhorse.The size of the competitions began to grow and with them, so did the community -- it also helps that Finland is \"just horse crazy,\" as Elsa describes it. Though not strictly limited to preteen and adolescent girls, the movement is dominated by that demographic.While for girls hobbyhorsing provides an escape from the awkwardness of teenage life -- or from the boys who try to take charge of sports, as Hobbyhorse Revolution star Alisa Aarniomaki explains to AP -- for the younger, budding hobbyists it's just a fun, new way to play.\"It can be done either alone or with friends. You can imagine different 'roles' to your horses,\" 10-year-old Janni Salo (unrelated to Elsa) tells CNN. \"They have names, are different ages and races, one is for jumping and the other is for trail riding. \"Some people can't deal with real horses because of allergies or expensive riding lessons and this is a way to keep in touch with horses and riding.\"Janni's mother, Niina, says her daughter has owned a hobbyhorse all her life but only started developing a real passion about three years ago.Around the same time, Janni started riding real horses -- a black Shetland pony called Peppi -- though this did nothing to diminish her interest in hobbyhorsing, but rather increased it.Such is her enthusiasm, Janni now takes one or two hobbyhorses to school each day so she can exercise with her friends.Niina has even had an impressive stable built for her daughter's hobbyhorses and other wooden horses in a field near their house.\"It's just like being with (real) horses,\" Janni says. \"You can do whatever you like, learn also 'real riding' skills and improve your condition. Jumping is the best!\"At the CityHorse event, she even had a hobbyhorse riding lesson from Elsa, something Niina described as a \"dream to these little girls.\" Photos: Royal Ascot: Hats, horses, historyThe prestigious Royal Ascot has strict rules when it comes to the dress code for those attending the high-society event.

Finns believe the Finnhorse to be capable of carrying out all their needs, from agriculture and forestry to sport and horse riding.Organizing and constructing an event of this size is no easy feat. The main arena, constructed from scratch, required 1,200 tonnes of sand to be laid and protect the grass, while 100 horses -- some from Iceland -- were brought in for the event.Fred Sundwall, general secretary for the Equestrian Federation of Finland, says the entire operation took a week to finish and the park returned to normal -- without a trace of a hobbyhorse -- the following Tuesday.\"The Equestrian Federation of Finland welcomes the increased hobbyhorse activities,\" he says. \"It is an excellent way to become acquainted with the horse world.\"Jumping up to 120 cm fences is also a tough sport by itself and a good complement to riding or any other sport.\"JUST WATCHEDRoyal Ascot & Raymond Blanc: the perfect pairReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRoyal Ascot & Raymond Blanc: the perfect pair 01:20Former Finnish prime minister, Alexander Stubb, agrees. \"It's a great new sport,\" he tells CNN. \"Anything to get kids moving.

Having climbed up Africa's highest mountain, taking goal posts and nets in tow, a group of fearless women have achieved what many thought impossible and played a 90-minute football match on Mount Kilimanjaro. The squad of 30 footballers representing 20 nationalities, who included retired US international Lori Lindsey and former England midfielder Rachel Unitt, completed a 11-a-side match at nearly 19,000 feet, an altitude never attempted before.Follow @cnnsport\n\nUsing flour to mark the pitch and trekking poles as corner flags, the women -- ranging in ages, from 18 to 66 years old -- played in punishing conditions on a volcanic ash pitch.The game -- between Volcano FC and Glacier FC -- ended goalless, but the result was inconsequential as the sole purpose of the challenge was to highlight the inequality women face in sport. Read MoreAmerican defender Erin Blankenship, co-founder of event organizers Equal Playing Fields, said: \"You can't challenge the fact that you've got a group of athletes who are playing at almost 19,000ft. It doesn't matter what gender they are.\"Substitutes' cheer from the sidelines during the match. The women trek up Mount Kilimanjaro before playing their match. The group sleep above the clouds on Mount Kilimanjaro.'Needing oxygen'Olympic champion Lindsey, who played for USA at the 2011 World Cup and 2012 London Olympics, was one of the star players taking part. She was keen to raise awareness of the issues women and girls face when playing sport.\"I'm fortunate enough to have had pioneers who came before me, but it's our responsibility to continue to make strides forward for the generations to come,\" she told CNN Sport before embarking on the trip. Playing in thin air, which causes a reduction in physical performance, isn't easy. In May 2007, FIFA -- football's world governing body -- introduced a temporary ban, revoked a year later, on international matches at more than 8,200ft above sea level, citing concerns about players' health and the \"unfair\" advantage to acclimatized home teams.Earlier in 2007, Brazilian club Flamengo had said it would boycott high-altitude games after a match at 12,467 ft -- against Bolivia's Real Potosi -- left some team members needing oxygen.\"We made a pact before the game that it was all about the game finishing,\" said Glacier FC coach Dawn Scott.\"It was equal opportunities and we termed the substitutes coming on as record makers as they'd be the ones pushing us on because you could see players dropping and needing oxygen towards the end.\"READ: Sweden's women wear motivational messagesREAD: Footballers to play match on Kilimanjaro Female footballers celebrate on Mount Kilimanjaro after breaking the world record for the highest match ever played.The fight for equality in women's sport Throughout history sportswomen have had to climb metaphorical mountains and organizers Equal Playing Field say the fight is ongoing, which is why they dreamed up this record-breaking mission. This year alone, the debate over equality has made headlines.Earlier this month it was revealed that Serena Williams, the most successful female tennis player in the Open era, was the only woman in Forbes' latest list of the world's top 100 highest-paid athletes.

In April, the US women's national soccer team ended a long-running dispute over pay and conditions by agreeing a new deal with US Soccer, the country's governing body.That was not the only case this year of international sportswomen taking a stand.Also in April, the Republic of Ireland women's football team threatened to go on strike. Players' representative, Stuart Gilhooly, said they were being treated like \"fifth-class citizens\" by the Football Association of Ireland.Meanwhile US women's hockey threatened to boycott the world championships before agreeing a pay deal just three days before the start of the tournament. Equal Playing Field had said it wanted to \"challenge the social norms for girls and women in sport\" and acknowledge \"the systematic, structured inequality that girls and women face in most aspects of their lives.\"Visit cnn.com for more news and videos What will their next challenge be?

Hamid Ali Jafari, a survivor who lived on the 11th floor of Grenfell Tower, said he hadn't been aware of it until contacted by CNN. Jafari's father is currently missing. \"No point in us being angry,\" Jafari said. \"If something happens we cannot be angry. We lost our father. There is no point in blaming each other, or the government because it is too late ... my father isn't going to come back.\" Jafari does think residents should attend the meeting, but doesn't blame the authorities.\"My point of view, we have to attend the meeting but government is the only person helping us right now,\" he said. \"I know it is not [a] government mistake ... government understand. They don't want anyone to die.\"Jafari said that the council's response had improved since the fire's chaotic immediate aftermath. Sajid Javid, who as Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government is overseeing the response, handed Jafari a card with his direct phone number and email address, he said. \"My dad's last wish was to have a house,\" Jafari said, \"so [the] government [is] trying to find a house with a garden so we can grow plants.\"But accommodation and council meetings aren't Jafari's immediate priority. \"We care more about finding my father than about a flat at the moment,\" he said. \"Hoping 1% maybe he is alive....

So it's official...... I've left rugby on a new journey and signed for the @atlantafalcons .

Abortion is illegal in almost all cases in Northern Ireland unless there is a direct threat to the mother's life. Read MoreLabour lawmaker Stella Creasy, who proposed the amendment, had gathered widespread support in the House of Commons, with members of different parties, including Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives, signing up to it. Speaking in the House of Commons, Creasy said she was withdrawing her amendment after receiving assurances from the government. Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond made the announcement on abortion funding.Labour lawmaker Stella Creasy tabled an amendment on abortion funding after the government's move.In a letter to colleagues, Justine Greening, the minister for women and equalities, outlined plans for funding to be made available as a direct response of the amendment.Creasy's proposal had asked the government to ensure \"the provision of adequate funding and guidance so that all UK citizens including those from Northern Ireland may access medical services including abortion procedures in England if they so wish without charge.\"DUP dealA vote on the amendment would have been the first serious test of May's deal with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which fiercely opposes abortion.Two other amendments to the Queen's Speech were both defeated Thursday. On Wednesday, the government narrowly defeated an amendment to scrap a pay cap for public sector workers by 14 votes.May is heavily dependent on the DUP, which agreed to prop up her minority government after a deal reached this week.Woah - chancellor just told house going 2 fund abortions 4 NI women in England.

Michelle O'Neill is the leader of Sinn Fein in Northern Ireland.Read: Northern Ireland is stuck in the same old political rutIt is also resisting calls from Sinn F\u00e9in to introduce a measure giving the Irish language the same status as English, while agreement over how to deal with the legacy of the Northern Ireland conflict remains elusive.There are also differences over Brexit, with the DUP in favor of leaving the European Union, though it is against a hard border with the Republic of Ireland, which could hamper trade and harm peace in the region.While Sinn F\u00e9in wants Northern Ireland to be granted special status with the EU, the DUP does not want anything to distinguish the region from the rest of Britain when it comes to ties with Brussels.What happens if there is no deal?If the parties fail to come to an agreement by Monday's deadline, it will be up to James Brokenshire, the Northern Ireland Secretary, to decide whether to reimpose direct rule or extend the deadline further.JUST WATCHEDFmr.

        "content": "London (CNN)At least 80 people are presumed to have been killed in the deadly blaze at Grenfell Tower, with UK police warning it is likely some victims will never be identified and that it could \"take until the end of the year\" before a final death toll is known.Det. Supt. Fiona McCormack, who is leading the investigation, said, \"We are many months from being able to provide a number which we believe accurately represents the total loss of life inside Grenfell Tower. \"Only after we have completed the search and recovery operation -- which will take until the end of the year -- and then months afterwards, when experts have carried out the identification process, will we be in a position to tell you who has died.\"McCormack added that a small number of flats are still unsafe to work in but police have spoken to people who lived, or have friends or relatives, in 106 of the tower's apartments. One of the biggest challenges facing investigators continues to be identifying and accounting anyone who may have been in the building that night. Authorities said they are using any sources available to them from \"government agencies to fast-food delivery companies\" to do so. Read MorePolice said that investigations have indicated that no one in 23 apartments spread between floors 11 to 23 survived the blaze.\"So -- at this stage -- we must presume that no one in those 23 flats survived. That would include those who lived there or any anyone who was visiting them,\" said McCormack. Authorities provided an update on the investigation as Prime Minister Theresa May announced that exterior cladding on 120 high-rise buildings across 37 local authority areas in England has failed fire safety checks. The checks are continuing across the country following the June 14 fire, which was apparently stoked by the building's flammable exterior cladding.How the UK's tower block crisis has spread in one graphicAddressing the House of Commons during Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) on Wednesday, May said, \"So far 100% of the samples that have come in have proved to be combustible.\"In light of the tests conducted to date, she urged people to take preemptive action before results are returned and work with their local fire services to ensure that buildings are safe for residents. The embattled Prime Minister was quizzed about fire safety, exterior cladding and public-sector cuts in a heated PMQs session. British PM Theresa May speaks during PMQs in the House of Commons, London on Wednesday.Corbyn: Grenfell 'must be wake-up call'It was the first time May has sparred with opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn since her party suffered a disappointing showing in the UK's general election earlier this month. Corbyn launched a furious diatribe from across the aisle, blaming austerity measures for a decline in public safety in recent years. \"When you cut local authority budgets by 40%, we all pay a price in public safety,\" Corbyn railed amid cries of \"shameful\" and \"apologize\" from Conservative backbenchers. \"Fewer building inspectors, fewer planning inspectors -- we all pay a price ... those cuts to the fire service have meant that there are 11,000 fewer firefighters.\"JUST WATCHEDWhat to know about Jeremy CorbynReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhat to know about Jeremy Corbyn 01:16Corbyn slammed the \"disastrous effects of austerity\" and accused the government of continuing to \"disregard working-class communities\" and of \"cutting corners.\" He continued: \"I urge the Prime Minister to come up with the resources needed to test and remove cladding, retrofit sprinklers, properly fund the firefighters and police so that all our communities can truly feel safe in their own homes. This disaster must be a wake-up call.\" But May pushed back, defending both her party and the former coalition government to argue that \"the cladding of tower blocks began under the (Tony) Blair government\" and that fire regulation checks had been amended as the result of a 2005 Labour government initiative. Queen's Speech voteFollowing the extended PMQs session -- which ran around 20 minutes over its allotted half-hour -- MPs gathered in the Commons for a debate on the Queen's speech. Last week, Queen Elizabeth II attended the State Opening of Parliament and read out a Brexit-heavy list of the minority government's intentions for the coming two years. The speech included eight bills centered on the UK leaving the European Union, and measures to address the recent terror attacks in Manchester and London, as well as the Grenfell fire.Northern Ireland party agrees to prop up Theresa May's UK governmentOn Thursday, MPs will be asked to approve the policy agenda in a vote in the Commons, with many seeing the vote as more of a vote of confidence for May and her minority government. \"The Democratic Unionist Party has said they will support her in [the Queen's speech vote]. But this deal is hugely controversial for a number of reasons, not least because May has agreed to pay more than a billion pounds to communities in Northern Ireland,\" explained CNN Political analyst Carole Walker. In a bid to stay in power, the Conservative Party announced a deal with Northern Ireland's DUP last week. Almost immediately, criticism of the agreement erupted from leaders in Wales and Scotland who asked why Northern Ireland should get more funds but no additional spending is being directed towards their devolved areas.

More than 3,000 fans were funneled into an area already packed with people with a safe capacity of just 1,600. Panic ensued and many fans were crushed to death.The fatal crush, which led to the game abandoned after just six minutes, led to all-seater stadiums being introduced across England.The defendants, except for Duckenfield, will appear at Warrington Magistrates' Court on August 9. A date for Duckenfield's court appearance will be set later.British Prime Minister Theresa May said the day would be one of \"mixed emotions\" for the families of the victims who were informed of the decision this morning. Barry Devonside reacts after the families of the 96 Hillsborough victims were told the decision that the Crown Prosecution Service will proceed with criminal charges.Barry Devonside, whose son Christopher, 18, was killed in the disaster, told reporters of the scene inside Parr Hall, Warrington, when families were informed of the decision to launch criminal proceedings against Duckenfield.\"Everybody applauded when it was announced that the most senior police officer on that particular day will have charges presented to him,\" Devonside told reporters.Who has been charged?Former South Yorkshire Police Chief David Duckenfield has been charged with manslaughter.David Duckenfield: The match commander for South Yorkshire Police on the day of the disaster has been charged with manslaughter over 95 of the 96 deaths.\"We will allege that David Duckenfield's failures to discharge his personal responsibility were extraordinarily bad and contributed substantially to the deaths of each of those 96 people who so tragically and unnecessarily lost their lives, Sue Hemming, the CPS Head of Special Crime and Counter Terrorism Division, said in a statement.\"The offense clearly sets out the basis of those allegations. We are unable to charge the manslaughter of Anthony Bland, the 96th casualty, as he died almost four years later.\"The law as it applied then provided that no person could be guilty of homicide where the death occurred more than a year and a day later than the date when the injuries were caused.\" Norman Bettison has been charged with four offenses of misconduct in public. Norman Bettison -- A former officer with South Yorkshire Police and subsequently Chief Constable of Merseyside and West Yorkshire Police, Bettison has been charged  with four offenses of misconduct in public office relating to telling alleged lies about his involvement in the aftermath of Hillsborough and the culpability of fans.Supporters are crushed against the barrier as disaster strikes before the FA Cup semi-final match.Graham Henry Mackrell --  Mackrell was Sheffield Wednesday Football Club's company secretary and safety officer at the time of the disaster and has been charged over health and safety offenses.He has been charged with two offenses of  contravening a term of condition of a safety certificate contrary to the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 and one offense of failing to take reasonable care for the health and safety of other persons who may have been affected by his acts or omissions at work under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974.

It's the second-biggest redesign of an NBA arena, behind the recent remodeling of Madison Square Garden.The Hawks will pay $50 million of the $192.5 million project cost, with the rest covered by the city of Atlanta, which owns the building that hosts approximately 170 events and nearly 2 million guests per year. Construction began June 20 and is due to finish during the 2018-2019 season, which marks the Hawks' 50th anniversary in Atlanta.The updated arena will have 360-degree access throughout.\"It's so much more than a renovation,\" Hawks COO Thad Sheely told CNN. \"A renovation implies that we're putting some paint on the walls, maybe you added a bathroom or two to your house. It doesn't really denote to scale. We really are, with almost at $200 million, are going to be able to touch almost every thing and facing piece of the building.\"Zac Brown, Killer Mike and TopgolfRead MoreThe plan includes celebrities, including Georgia musicians Zac Brown and Michael Render, known as Killer Mike.Brown, lead singer of the three-time Grammy-winning, multiplatinum Zac Brown Band, and his executive chef, Rusty Hamlin -- both Hawks fans -- will open Zac Brown's Social Club, a Southern gourmet restaurant with a live music stage.The updated video board will be more than three times the size of the old one.\"Food has always been a passion of mine, from owning my own restaurant on Lake Oconee, to opening the Social Club,\" Brown said. \"I love what food does for friends and family, it gives us all something to gather around and a centerpiece for the time we spend together. I'm excited to open Zac Brown's Social Club and to share it with all of Atlanta.\"Brown is known for his Eat and Greet events, where he invites some 150 fans to enjoy a Southern-style meal created by Hamlin and served from \"Cookie,\" a custom-built commercial kitchen on the 54-foot long, 18-wheeler that whisks the band around the country.\"We both know that a plate of food in front of someone makes more of an impression and memories than an autograph,\" Hamlin, who lives in Atlanta, said to CNN. \"This is why we started Eat and Greet back in the day on tour. Everything that we do is revolved around really taking care of our fans. Now, being able to do this at Philips Arena is just very, very cool and amazing for us because this is our community.\"Zac Brown Band's truck, Cookie, parked outside of Philips Arena on Wednesday.Render, an Atlanta rapper, actor and Hawks fan since childhood, will bring his signature Graffitis SWAG Barbershops to Philips Arena. The name stands for \"shaves, washes and grooming,\" and the shop will have a view of the on-court action.Render jumped at the opportunity, telling CNN, \"This is definitely one of the highlights of my life.\"\"After we calmly said yes, we hung up the phone and ran around the room and screamed like children,\" he said. \"We hope that this is just our first one in a major sports arena and not our last one.\"Topgolf simulators also will have a new home at the revamped arena, where the existing six-level wall of suites will be demolished and replaced with a new concourse, upper deck and conference center with new seating options and amenities. There will be two Topgolf Swing Suites.Two suites will be equipped with the golf simulators, making Philips Arena the first sports-and-entertainment facility to offer the Topgolf Swing Suite technology. It is also is available at the Four Seasons Hotel in Houston.The relationship with the Hawks is a natural fit, Ron Powers, president of the Topgolf Swing Suite social experience, told CNN. After visiting with Hawks' executives, it was one of the easiest business decisions he ever made, he said.\"You ever had that first date where everything just felt right and you were dying not to go too far, too fast?\" Powers said. \"That's the way it was with (Hawks CEO) Steve (Koonin) and I. I couldn't wait to get back and put a deal together.\"First bar on an NBA floorWhen the project is done, the arena will have 360-degree connectivity to go with new restaurants and bars -- including the first bar on an NBA floor. The Hawks Bar, in the shape of the team's iconic \"Pac-Man\" logo, will be just steps from the court.Philips Arena will have the first bar on an NBA floor.\"You literally will be 10 feet from the action while you're having your cocktail and standing and talking with your friends,\" Koonin said to CNN. \"The day of sitting in your seat, eating your hot dog and having a beer are gone forever. It's about socialization and a great night out.\"The new center-hung scoreboard will be more than three times the size of the old one. For concerts, there will be new dressing-room and backstage areas, as well as improved acoustics in the building.The endeavor makes Philips Arena the third Atlanta pro sports venue in recent years to undergo a huge upgrade. Mercedes-Benz Stadium, home to the NFL's Atlanta Falcons and MLS's Atlanta United, is due to open later this year. The Atlanta Braves began playing this year at the new SunTrust Park.A view of Philips Arena from this week.Philips Arena was built in the late 1990s as a multipurpose facility for the Hawks and the NHL's Thrashers, which played in Atlanta from 1999 to 2011. The latest project will update the design into a basketball-first facility. Instead of building a new arena, which contractors estimated would cost $550 million, the Hawks committed to an 18-year lease extension, keeping them at Philips Arena through 2046.The arena will close over the next two summers for renovation but is due to be open this October for the start of the Hawks' 2017-2018 season.HOK, the largest US-based architecture-engineering firm and the second-largest interior design firm, is the leading architect on the project.",

Bond died at home on Tuesday following a short illness, his publisher HarperCollins announced Wednesday in a statement on Facebook, calling him a \"giant of children's literature.\" Today is a very sad day. Michael Bond CBE will be missed by many. pic.twitter.com/ZoCb5sU2V9\u2014 Paddington (@paddingtonbear) June 28, 2017\n Bond was born in Berkshire, England in 1926 and began writing in 1945, after serving in World War II.He was working as a cameraman for the BBC when he came up with the idea of a small toy bear that he named after Paddington Station in London, near where he was living at the time. Read MoreBond's first book, \"A Bear Called Paddington,\" was published in 1958, and follows the adventures of a small orphaned bear as he travels from Peru to the British capital. He is found at Paddington Station wearing a tag saying \"Please look after this bear. Thank you,\" and is taken in by the Brown family. Bond has said that Paddington was inspired in part by his memories of Jewish children who were evacuated to London during World War II.Sad to hear that Michael Bond, Paddington Bear creator, has died.

So Paddington, in a sense, was a refugee, and I do think that there's no sadder sight than refugees,\" Bond told the Guardian in 2014. The UK-based Refugee Council charity thanked Bond for \"all he did to help people understand refugee issues\" in a tweet Wednesday. More than 35 million Paddington books have been sold worldwide, according to HarperCollins. The character has inspired an animated series and two films, including one due out later this year.     It seems particularly poignant that we should learn of dear Michael Bond's death on the last day of shooting our second film about his unique, loveable creation. In Paddington, Michael created a character whose enthusiasm and optimism has given pleasure to millions across the generations. Michael will be greatly missed by his legions of fans and especially by his wife Sue, his family and of course by his beloved guinea pigs. He leaves a special legacy: long live the bear from darkest Peru. #michaelbond #paddington A post shared by Hugh Bonneville (@bonhughbon) on Jun 28, 2017 at 6:15am PDT\nThe actor Hugh Bonneville, star of the Paddington movies, wrote on Instagram that it was \"particularly poignant\" that Bond had died on the last day of shooting for the upcoming film. \"Michael will be greatly missed by his legions of fans and especially by his wife Sue, his family and of course by his beloved guinea pigs,\" Bonneville wrote. \"He leaves a special legacy: long live the bear from darkest Peru.\"Stephen Fry tweeted that Bond was as \"kindly, dignified, charming & lovable\" as Paddington Bear himself, while David Walliams wrote that the Paddington theme music \"is enough to make me smile.\"So sorry to hear that Michael Bond has departed.

Bond published almost 200 books during his lifetime, HarperCollins said. He was awarded a CBE by Queen Elizabeth II in 2015. \"He was a true gentleman, a bon viveur, the most entertaining company and the most enchanting of writers,\" Ann-Janine Murtagh, Executive Publisher of HarperCollins Children's Books, said in a statement. \"He will be forever remembered for his creation of the iconic Paddington, with his duffle coat and wellington boots, which touched my own heart as a child and will live on in the hearts of future generations.\"",

        "content": "Story highlightsGerman lawmakers will vote on same-sex marriage this weekChancellor Angela Merkel said Monday she would like to see \"vote of conscience\" on the issueGermany lags behind many other countries on gay rights (CNN)German lawmakers will decide Friday whether to legalize same-sex marriage, according to CNN affiliate NTV. The snap vote comes after Chancellor Angela Merkel said Monday that she would like to see parliament move towards a \"vote of conscience\" on the issue.Following Merkel's comments, German politicians writing on Twitter called for a vote to be held as soon as possible. Martin Schulz, leader of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) -- the second largest party in parliament -- called for parliament not to wait until after the federal election in September. \"We will push through marriage equality in Germany,\" he tweeted. \"This week.\"Wir werden die Ehe f\u00fcr alle beschlie\u00dfen. Diese Woche.\u2014 Martin Schulz (@MartinSchulz) June 27, 2017\n\nThe vote is likely to pass with strong support from other German parties and from some lawmakers within Merkel's CDU. Volker Kauder, leader of the parliamentary group of the ruling CDU faction, called Tuesday for CDU members voting for and against the law to show respect for each other's position, according to NTV. But he also warned that such a sudden vote could lead to a \"hasty decision.\"Merkel's comments on Monday represent a shift for the German leader and her conservative party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which has opposed same-sex marriage to keep in line with \"traditional\" family values. The Chancellor made the comments in response to a question Monday evening at an event in Berlin hosted by women's magazine Brigitte. Asked by a gay man in the audience whether he would be able to refer to his partner as \"my husband,\" Merkel acknowledged the widespread support for gay marriage among German voters -- who will vote soon in federal elections -- and suggested a free vote on same-sex marriage could be held among members of parliament. Read MoreMerkel hinted at a vote on same-sex marriage during an event in Berlin Monday evening.\nThe Lesben-und Schwulenverband, Germany's biggest LGBT campaigning group, welcomed Merkel's response in a statement Tuesday. \"The LSVD welcomes the fact that after 15 years of an ideological blockade Mrs Merkel and the Christian Democratic Union are ready to make some progress on the issue of same-sex marriage,\" the statement said.  \"Equal rights for all people are a requirement of our basic law ... We want to live in a country where lesbians and gay men are no longer discriminated against.\" Merkel under pressureMany social media users welcomed Schulz's call for a vote. But some expressed frustration that Merkel is taking action only after 12 years in power and see her announcement as no more than a political tactic.\"Please don't forget who has withheld #Ehefueralle from you for 12 years!\" Twitter user Pepper Ann wrote Tuesday. \"This has nothing to do with values.\"Bitte vergesst nicht, wer euch 12 Jahre lang die #Ehefueralle vorenthalten hat! Mit Wertsch\u00e4tzung hat das nichts zu tun! #Wahlkampf\u2014 Pepper Ann (@MadameNon) June 27, 2017\n\nWith September's election looming, Merkel has come under increasing pressure on the issue. In the past two weeks her main rivals and potential coalition partners have all come out in support of \"Ehe fur alle\" (marriage for all).LGBT activists demonstrate outside the German parliament in May 2017. The left-leaning Green party and the centrist FDP both said that they would not enter into any coalition deal if \"Ehe fur alle\" was not enshrined in it. The left-leaning Die Linke party has long supported full equality.And in a speech at the SPD congress on Sunday, Schulz promised that same-sex marriage would be legalized in any government involving his party.Dutch men hold hands in solidarity with gay coupleFamily \"is not only father, mother, child,\" he told a hall packed full of SPD delegates and supporters. Family is \"there wherever people take responsibility for each other.\"Of the major parties, only the right-wing Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD) has not voiced support for same-sex marriage -- and Merkel has already ruled out a coalition deal with that party.Trouble for Merkel's sister party?Gay rights have long been a controversial issue within the CDU and its more conservative Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU).During a dispute over tax laws in 2012, 13 members of the CDU spoke out in favor of tax equality for same-sex couples. \"In homosexual partnerships, people take long-term responsibility for each other,\" Kristina Schroder, then Germany's minister for family affairs and a member of the CDU, told German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung. \"They are living conservative values.\"Germany to quash convictions for homosexuality, pay compensationBut the CSU was strongly against the proposed change. \"The marriage of man and woman is under special protection because it is fundamentally oriented toward creating new life. This is not the case in homosexual relationships,\" the CSU's whip in Germany's parliament, Gerda Hasselfeldt, told ARD television.The CDU needs the support of the CSU and its traditional, religious voters if it is to win the federal election in September.But Anja Neundorf, associate professor at the University of Nottingham, thinks that some of those voters may be put off by Merkel's new stance on gay marriage. They are \"much more sensitive to this issue\" than other voters, Neundorf said. And some might choose to simply stay at home on polling day, she explained.Twitter user Maximilan Krah was disappointed by Merkel's comments. \"SPD, FDP, Greens have made \"Ehe fur alle\" a condition for any coalition deal, CDU will also topple,\" he wrote. \"Families with children will lose special protections.\"SPD, FDP, Gr\u00fcne machen \"Ehe f\u00fcr alle\" zur Koalitionsbedingung, CDU wird also umfallen. Familien mit Kindern verlieren den besonderen Schutz.\u2014 Dr. Maximilian Krah (@KrahMax) June 25, 2017\n\nGermany currently lags behind many of its European neighbors when it comes to gay rights. Same-sex couples may enter into a civil union but cannot marry, and they are not allowed to jointly adopt children. In 2001, the Netherlands was one of the first countries to legalize same-sex marriage. Nearly 20 other countries have followed suit, including Spain, Canada, Argentina, France, the United Kingdom and the United States in 2015.CNN's Nadine Schmidt contributed to this article",

Video showed Erdogan looking on as Turkish guards beat up protesters, before heading into the ambassador's home.A senior State Department official told CNN at the time that the Turkish officials involved in the fight appeared to be a mix of Turkish embassy staff and Erdogan's personal guards. The official also confirmed that two members of Erdogan's detail \"were briefly detained during the altercations and subsequently released\" and returned to Turkey with Erdogan.The Turkish embassy rejected the US' version of events, however, claiming that the protesters outside the residence were \"affiliated with the PKK (Kurdistan Workers Party)\" -- a banned separatist group in Turkey -- and had assembled without permission.Arrest warrants issued for Turkish security officials over embassy brawl in DCPolice in Washington issued warrants for 12 of Erdogan's security officers in mid-June.

LGBT supporters march towards Istanbul's Taksim Square.They encountered heavy police presence along Istanbul's main commercial street, where the parade was supposed to take place. Istanbul's Pride organizers said at least 20 people were arrested.Read MoreRiot police closed off entrances to the parade route with water cannons. Crowds in Taksim Square chanted \"Where are you my love? / I am here my love!\" as police used tear gas and rubber pellets to break up the crowd. LGBT supporters run from tear gas fired by police after attempting to march to Taksim Square.Guests at a nearby cafe whistled in protest as police detained a paradegoer, prompting riot police to tear through tables and chairs to clear out the crowd.The crowds flocked to small neighborhoods, dancing and chanting, but were soon dispersed by police. Pride organizers said the crackdown was about intolerance and not security. They called it another facet of Turkey's creeping authoritarianism under the ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP. Riot police detain LGBTQ supporters in Istanbul.Although homosexuality has been legal in Turkey since 1923, the country has one of the worst records of human rights violations against LGBTQ people in Europe, and Turkey's LGBTQ community has been increasingly vocal about violence against members of the community.Organizers said they were hopeful that the parade would be allowed to go ahead this year because it fell on the first day of Eid. In the past two years, the parade date overlapped with Ramadan, the holy month during which Muslims fast. The far right Islamist Alperen group issued a threat several days before the parade. Turkish riot police officers block activists as they try to gather for the pride parade.\"We will not allow this march which calls itself a pride march but in reality is normalizing and encourging immorality and tawdryness that touches the nerves of society,\" the statement said. The group said they would be on the ground to prevent the parade, vowing to outnumber paradegoers. Parade organizers said members of Alperen were among those detained by police.

Four years ago and poised on match point at 8-1, the Kiwis' seemingly impregnable lead shrank day by day until the Larry Ellison-bankrolled Americans completed one of sport's greatest comebacks.This time, a revamped New Zealand outfit -- with wholesale changes to personnel and a radical design program -- was too strong for Oracle and its pugnacious Australian skipper Jimmy Spithill, who had been eying a \"three-peat\" in sailing's most prestigious competition after wins in 2010 and 2013.READ: How Team NZ found redemption on the wavesRead More Photos: Emirates Team New Zealand, helmed by Peter Burling, celebrate after winning the America's Cup Match in Hamilton, Bermuda.Hide Caption 1 of 5 Photos: Burling, at the age of 26, becomes the youngest winning helmsman in the history of the America's Cup.Hide Caption 2 of 5 Photos: Fans young and old gathered at the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron in Auckland to watch and, eventually, celebrate.Hide Caption 3 of 5 Photos: New Zealand sealed an 7-1 triumph with victory in Monday's ninth race of the final match.Hide Caption 4 of 5 Photos: The racing took place on the waters of Bermuda's Great Sound.Hide Caption 5 of 5 \"We're just on top of the world,\" New Zealand's Peter Burling, at 26 the youngest helmsman to lift the America's Cup, told BT Sport just moments after the triumph had been secured.\"It's going to be a good night.\"In the fallout from San Francisco, the New Zealanders parted company with long-time skipper Dean Barker, who joined Softbank Team Japan, and brought in up-and-coming helmsman Burling, who won Olympic 49er gold in Rio in 2016.Australian Glenn Ashby, one of the world's best multihull sailors, was elevated to skipper and a whole raft of athletic young sailors brought in.After the events of four years ago, it was a moment to savor for Ashby.\"It's been an amazing journey for us as a team,\" he said. \"We've been able to pull off the almost unimaginable.\"\"It was absolutely brutal for the team,\" added Ashby, referencing the collapse of 2013. \"It was a hard pill to swallow. It is a great redemption, just a relief to right the wrongs of the last campaign.\"Peter Burling celebrates becoming the youngest helmsman to win the America's Cup.READ: The Olympic cyclist who pedals on waterFor Spithill, it was the end of his bid for a third successive Cup win.\"We're disappointed, but first of all full credit to Team New Zealand,\" said the 37-year-old Spithill.\"They fully deserve it.\"\"You've really got to give credit to them, what an incredible job they've done,\" he added. \"Unfortunately they were the quickest boat today.\"Behind the scenes, and with a budget a fraction of Oracle's approximate $100 million, the Kiwis were working on a revolutionary design, replacing the traditional arm-powered grinders with cycling pedestals to generate more power to fuel the hydraulic systems on the new generation of foiling catamarans. Alongside that they developed highly efficient systems for marshaling the power to control the wingsail and daggerboards, designed a formidable package of foils and rudders to suit the conditions, and brought in Olympic cycling bronze medalist Simon van Velthooven to lead the \"cyclor\" training program.The Kiwis were last to arrive in Bermuda, but they quickly dominated the challenger series, beating Swedish syndicate Artemis in the final to earn the right to face the Americans again in the America's Cup proper.As well as the agonizing defeat in San Francisco in 2013 Team New Zealand had lost to Alinghi in 2007 and suffered a 5-0 whitewash at the hands of the Swiss team in 2003.The racing took place on the waters of Bermuda's Great Sound.As winner, Emirates Team New Zealand has earned the right to take the competition back home and will decide the format and timing of the next event.In the build-up to the 35th America's Cup cycle, the other five teams signed up to a framework agreement guaranteeing a blueprint for the future, but the New Zealanders, under chief executive Grant Dalton, refused to comply.Whether the event will even continue in high-tech foiling catamarans is yet to be seen.The America's Cup is back in Kiwi hands.",

To quote one of his many one liners, \"One day you are a rooster and the next day you're a feather duster.\"But he has faced adversity on the water before. He was a teenager on board Ragamuffin in the notorious 1998 Sydney to Hobart race in which six people were killed.And he will forever be remembered for his pivotal role in Team USA's incredible recovery in 2013.But as the 37-year-old puts it himself: \"History means nothing,\" while also downplaying the magic of the last comeback.The Kiwi juggernaut rolls on while @oracleteamusa have their backs against the wall.

The answer was it was a lot of little things.\"Spithill has rightly been praised for his sailing prowess. In 2010, he became the youngest winning helmsman in the cup's history -- a record Burling looks on course to eclipse.And the occasionally brash Aussie has earned a reputation for his aggressive approach, although this match itself has been littered with errors from him.Read: How technology shaped the America's CupOn Sunday, he mistimed his start allowing the Kiwis to get the jump and in the subsequent race he lost valuable speed after getting boxed in by Burling. Where there had been hope with a first victory to make it 4-1 on the Saturday, US Cup hopes quickly evaporated.In San Francisco, perhaps crucially, there had been a five-day break to regroup before the comeback began in earnest.READ: How tech made the America's Cup sexyBoxing mentalityWhat is clear is that Spithill is backed into a corner, and the boxer in him -- the consensus is he could have represented Australia at Olympic level had he so desired -- will have to come out fighting.\"As a young kid I used to get picked on a lot because of the red hair and freckles,\" he said in one pre-Cup interview. \"You either let it happen or you can do something about it.\" So, he laced up his gloves, which he also credits with stopping him from going down the wrong path with the wrong crowd shortly after his parents separated.By then, though, sailing had the edge on boxing. When he relocated from Sydney, his only way of getting to school was by boat.The Pitbull tag stuck in the 2007 America's Cup when skippering the Prada team. He knew he lacked the necessary pace but his aggression -- much to the delight of the Italian fans -- saw the team punching above their weight.For the next edition, he took flying lessons to help him better understand the aerodynamics of the boats he was sailing.Read: The most technologically advanced boats in the worldBut it is the Kiwis that have been flying to date, and the uphill task is arguably even tougher than back in 2013.Oracle Team USA have struggled to make a splash in this year's America's Cup match.READ: How America's Cup boats sail on the edge of safetyDesign criticism\"We've been here before, we will fight all the way,\" Spithill said staring down the barrel of defeat. \"It's a tall mountain to climb.\"Whatever the result, now is not the time for recriminations, and Spithill will not be the only one to whom the finger of blame will be pointed.Former America's Cup skipper Paul Cayard believes Oracle's design team have done too little too late, altering the rudders to help hoist the boat higher when foiling.\"They are now minimum size, and they were maximum size,\" said a bemused Cayard. \"They've got 30 engineers from Airbus given to the team for three years and they didn't get the drag associated with the foils right.\"READ: The Olympic cyclist who pedals on waterIt is a far cry from their dominance of the qualifying stages, since when Burling and Team New Zealand have grown in stature and confidence.Their CEO Grant Dalton, though, will be mindful of San Francisco '13.

Edwards says: \"I asked to sleep in the car park, but she said 'there's no point you staying here on your own you may as well sleep on the floor at ours.'\"When I got to the house she introduced her husband and the dog and the lads came in a little bit later while we were having a cup of tea and a chat.\"Akira Ioane (left) and brother Rieko are expected to achieve great things with the All BlacksREAD: Are New Zealand the world's greatest sports team?Edwards, however, did not immediately recognize the New Zealand behemoths, who still share a room at their parents' house.

Worst affected are those who lost loved ones, homes and possessions in the June 14 blaze.

Many of the buildings at issue are social housing blocks, whose occupants complain of longstanding neglect by the authorities.It also comes at a time when the country is reeling from a series of fatal terrorist attacks in London and Manchester that have highlighted tensions in some communities, even as many have rallied to show unity.No break for Britain: Photographer finds resilience among tragedyWhile emergency responders won plaudits in the wake of the fire, politicians have faced tough questions and vocal protests.UK Prime Minister Theresa May this week apologized for the authorities' \"failure\" in the initial aftermath and promised more help. The local council's chief executive resigned amid the angry public backlash.May said Saturday that the government is working with Camden Council and others to address fire safety in residential blocks nationwide.\"We're making sure that the resources are there to ensure that what is needed to keep people safe is being done,\" she said.Resident: 'Just a scene of chaos'Camden Council said its sudden order Friday to remove residents from four of the five tower blocks on the Chalcots Estate was \"essential\" after the London Fire Brigade discovered problems with gas pipe insulation and other fire safety issues. It previously had said the combustible cladding on the Chalcots Estate \"significantly differs\" from that on Grenfell Tower, though it was not fitted to the standard the council had commissioned.Decant was essential. @LondonFire identified issues around gas insulation & other concerns which with along with cladding issue means unsafe\u2014 Camden Council (@camdentalking) June 24, 2017\nSome residents of the 650 homes spent the night on air beds in a local sports center. Others took refuge with friends or family, or were put up in hotel rooms. The evacuees included the elderly, children and family pets.Now, they could wait weeks for the council to make the buildings safe by removing the cladding and carrying out other remedial work.Residents are evacuated Friday from the Taplow block of the Chalcots Estate in Camden.Sayed Meah, who has lived on the estate for all of his 34 years, told CNN it was \"just a scene of chaos\" Friday night as residents found out -- some only from TV reports -- that they had to pack what they needed for \"two to four weeks\" and leave. \"Elderly people, babies, pregnant women, mothers, you can imagine -- 4,000 people,\" he said. \"They shouldn't have done it the way they did last night.\" He said his chief concern was for his vulnerable, disabled mother, who is in her late 70s and needs around-the-clock care. He decided to stay in her flat overnight despite the warnings from fire safety chiefs. He was still waiting at lunchtime Saturday to hear what accommodation his mother would receive.A hole remains where a panel of external cladding was removed Friday from a tower block on the Chalcots Estate in north London.Meah, who works as an Uber driver so he has the flexibility to help care for his mother, said he heard stories of other residents being placed far from their homes in areas on the outskirts of London.\"It's the end of Ramadan tomorrow,\" he said. \"We're supposed to be celebrating Eid. I just want to break down.\"\"I just want whoever is responsible to be held accountable for all the failings that the fire brigade has found ...  Someone's been cutting corners or someone hasn't been overlooking the works.\" Gould, the Camden Council leader, defended its short-notice decision to evacuate the towers. She told reporters that the London Fire Brigade had told her it was \"categorically\" unsafe for people to stay in the blocks overnight and that the council had to put residents' safety first.Residents leave a tower block on the Chalcots Estate on Friday after it failed a fire inspection.'I do not want ... hidden victims'Police are considering manslaughter charges among the criminal offenses that may have been committed at Grenfell Tower, they said Friday.Samples of cladding and insulation from the tower failed safety tests, Detective Chief Constable Fiona McCormack said. The results were so concerning that the police immediately shared the data with the government and councils around the country.Refugee fled Syria violence only to die in the London fireThe police investigation, which is focused on how the fire spread so quickly, is looking at all the organizations involved in building and refurbishing the property. Grenfell residents and London lawmaker David Lammy, of the opposition Labour Party, have spoken of their fears that wrongdoing might have been covered up.Meantime, specialized teams continue the grueling task of searching the charred shell of the building, McCormack told reporters. Their work comes amid fears that the death toll could rise above the 79 now confirmed or presumed dead.Police have appealed for any information that could establish a complete picture of who was in the tower that fateful night, whether residents or visitors.  \"I do not want there to be any hidden victims of this tragedy,\" McCormack said. \"I fear that there are more, and I do not know who they are at the moment.\"Flowers are placed outside the Notting Hill Methodist Church in west London on Sunday, June 18, as a memorial to those who died in Grenfelll Tower fire. The block housed a diverse community of as many as 500 people, including many from overseas. Among the handful confirmed dead so far are a Syrian refugee who had fled civil war in search of a better life and a promising young artist, Khadija Saye.The government has promised not to check the immigration status of those who come forward with information.Volunteers fill the gapsAs the authorities' initial response to the Grenfell fire faltered, public-spirited volunteers stepped in to fill the gaps, handing out food, water and other supplies. Millions of pounds (dollars) were donated to charitable funds to help the survivors. The government has offered financial aid and promised to rehouse those who lost their homes within three weeks. Many are now staying in emergency accommodation. But in a city where social housing is in increasingly short supply and private rents are high, the prospect that thousands more people may need emergency housing -- potentially for weeks on end as cladding is removed from their tower blocks -- presents a daunting challenge. \"The Grenfell Tower victims, my heart goes out to them, I still think about them,\" Meah said. \"But at the same time, things like this is probably going to be happening throughout the country now.\"CNN's Simon Cullen and Deanna Hackney contributed to this report.",

However, two of those nine points will expire after the British Grand Prix on July 16.

It remained on the books until 1994.The Bundestag, Germany's lower legislative body, voted Thursday to quash all Paragraph 175 convictions from the post-World War II era, German media outlets reported.Of the 64,000 men convicted since the 1945, an estimated 5,000 are still alive, justice ministry figures show, German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle reported.The men are expected to receive 3,000 euros (about $3,350) in compensation for their convictions, plus 1,500 euros (about $1,675) for every year they spent in prison, the broadcaster reported.Read MoreGermany's upper house has announced it will approve the bill, Deutsche Welle said.'Justice is never too late'Ahead of Thursday's vote, German Justice Minister Heiko Mass tweeted \"the rehabilitation of the victims of Paragraph 175 shows ... justice is never too late.\"Sp\u00e4ter Akt der Gerechtigkeit: Bundest wird heute Gesetz zur Rehabilitierung der nach Paragraph 175 verurteilten Homosexuellen beschliessen. pic.twitter.com/tubdkDEpcf\u2014 Heiko Maas (@HeikoMaas) June 22, 2017\n\nThe bill, however, has stoked some controversy. The Lesbian and Gay Federation in Germany said the move returned some dignity to those who had been persecuted under Paragraph 175 but that the compensation was not enough. The legislation also discriminates against gay men by setting the age of consent for them at 16 years old, compared with 14 years old for heterosexuals, the group said. That means men who were prosecuted for sex with 14- or 15-year-olds wouldn't have their convictions quashed.\"It would have been right and in accordance with the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights to apply the identical age for heterosexual couples in hindsight for homosexual relations,\" Germany's Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency said, calling the caveat \"extremely regrettable.\"",

Documents have already been seized, she said.McCormack said the number of people dead or presumed dead remains at 79, but she fears the true number could be higher. She appealed for people to come forward with information about anyone who may have been in the building on the night of the fire. UK authorities have given assurances that they will not check anyone's immigration status as a result of information given to police in relation to the blaze. The 24-story high-rise was home to 125 families, but visitors may also have been in the building when the flames took hold.

Work at the scene of the fire is \"difficult and distressing,\" but search teams are endeavoring to recover everything possible so it can be returned to victims' families and survivors.Read More\"Such is the devastation inside, our forensic search and recovery may not be complete by the end of the year,\" she said. \"There is a terrible reality that we may not find or identify all those who died due to the intense heat of the fire, but we will do absolutely everything we can with the utmost sensitivity and dignity.\"Failed safety testsSpeculation has focused on the role that cladding used in a recent refurbishment of the tower may have played in the fire, which appeared to spread quickly up the building's exterior in the early hours of June 14.Samples of insulation from the tower and equivalent aluminum composite tiles sent by police for analysis have failed safety tests, McCormack said. \"Such are the safety concerns with the outcome of these tests we have immediately shared the data with the Department for Communities and Local Government, who are already sharing that information with local councils throughout the country,\" she said.Investigators are also looking at the insulation behind the cladding and how the tiles were installed, she said.The ruined Grenfell Tower, seen Friday in London, was destroyed by fire last week.With the inquiry now in its second week, police have started taking witness statements from those who were in the tower, McCormack said, and have listened to all of the more than 600 emergency calls made that night to get a full understanding of how the fire spread. \"Some of those calls are over an hour long and truly harrowing in their content,\" she added.McCormack also urged any residents of Grenfell Tower who had previously reported or had concerns about the building's safety to get in touch with police.Refugee fled Syria violence only to die in the London fire\"We will identify and investigate any criminal offense and, of course, given the deaths of so many people we are considering manslaughter, as well as criminal offenses and breaches of legislation and regulations,\" she said. The fire was not set deliberately but started in a Hotpoint fridge-freezer that was not previously part of any product recall, McCormack added. Police are talking to the manufacturers.In a statement, Whirlpool -- which owns Hotpoint -- offered its condolences to the fire victims and said it was \"working with the authorities to obtain access to the appliance so that we can assist with the ongoing investigations.\"Suspect cladding found on 11 high-risesThe UK government said Thursday it was carrying out tests on 600 high-rise buildings across England that are covered in cladding, with at least 11 high-rise buildings so far identified as having combustible panels.Grenfell Tower victim Khadija Saye's art is now on display at Tate BritainThe affected buildings, housing potentially thousands of residents, are in eight local authority areas, including Manchester, Plymouth and Camden in north London, Communities and Local Government Secretary Sajid Javid said in a letter to lawmakers.Addressing Parliament earlier Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May said a statement on the test results of the cladding samples taken from Grenfell Tower would be made in the next 48 hours.She added that the government could test more than 100 samples a day, through the Building Research Establishment, with the results coming within hours.In total, 151 homes were destroyed in the fire, May said.

So we're scared, we're genuinely scared (for) our lives.\"Grants for survivors, victims' familiesAdditional financial help was announced Friday for victims' families and survivors of the fire in the form of charitable grants.Mixed welcome for London fire victims at luxury complexThe next-of-kin of those killed will receive an initial \u00a320,000 (about $25,400), while those seriously injured will be given up to an initial \u00a310,000, according to a statement from the Charity Commission. Those made homeless will get a \"fresh start\" grant of \u00a310,000 once they are permanently rehoused, it said.The money will come from several bodies which have been coordinating fundraising efforts for the victims. More than \u00a310 million has been raised so far.The government has also promised medical and financial aid to those affected, as well as committing to rehousing them within three weeks.CNN's Lindsay Isaac, Simon Cullen, Rebecca Wright, James Masters and Ivana Kottasova contributed to this report.",

If it wins this weekend's four races, sport's oldest trophy will be heading home with them.Read MoreIts quite a turnaround. Few teams have endured a more tumultuous four-year lead-in to the America's Cup.Reflecting on his team's 2013 collapse on the waters of San Francisco Bay, CEO Grant Dalton says: \"I don't think you ever get over that.\"READ: America's Cup boats sailing close to the windIn the wake of a now infamous choke, the team were met with recriminations having lost an 8-1 lead. in part down, this was due to the fact the team were part-funded by government money.Simon van Velthooven, then an Olympic cyclist and now one of the cyclists on board, likened it \"to a nation in mourning, it was that bad.\"The races in the US took place at around 7am New Zealand time, meaning a fervent sailing nation was glued to the television before its morning commute.Dalton copped the majority of the flak, which he says was fair to a certain degree \"because there was government money involved, it was everyone's business.\" Photos: Multi-million dollar investment sparks TV boostUsing helicopters and drones, the America's Cup been at the forefront of technological advances in TV.Hide Caption 1 of 5 Photos: Multi-million dollar investment sparks TV boostA container doubling as a technology studio is the hub for the team working the cutting-edge graphics.Hide Caption 2 of 5 Photos: Multi-million dollar investment sparks TV boostThe brainchild of Stan Honey, the advancements for 2013 lend themselves to a one-off conversation with Larry Ellison back in 1995.Hide Caption 3 of 5 Photos: Multi-million dollar investment sparks TV boostData is passed from telemetry on the boats to helicopters, to give the public a better understanding of the race's complexities.Hide Caption 4 of 5 Photos: Multi-million dollar investment sparks TV boostFresh innovations loom for the final between Emirates Team New Zealand (above) and Oracle Team USA, including thermal imagery on the sailors.Hide Caption 5 of 5Giving youth a chanceAnd then he was very nearly toppled from his position in charge, an internal coup was only headed off thanks to the backing of the team's chief patron Matteo de Nora -- as well as other key backers.But shoring up his own position was only half of the battle. The government pulled its funding, leaving a monstrous black hole in the team's budget.It meant 50% of the budget from the last America's Cup and a drop in salary for some on the team. But it also meant Dalton was freed to a adopt a more novel approach to setting up a sailing team.Out went Barker to Softbank Team Japan -- much to the initial chagrin of the wider Kiwi public -- and in came Peter Burling, the up-and-coming young star of New Zealand sailing.It is Burling who has been at the helm for each of the team's races in Bermuda, seemingly unflappable against far more experienced and aggressive sailors in Ben Ainslie and now Jimmy Spithill.READ: The Olympic cyclist who pedals on waterBut Burling is just part of the youth policy, joined on the team by Blair Tuke, with whom he won Olympic gold in the 49er class in Rio de Janeiro.In fact, it has led to an average age on board of under 30.Key to that is Burling, hailed by former Team New Zealand boss Sir Russell Coutts as an \"incredible talent\", while 1983 cup-winning skipper John Bertrand has described him as \"a phenomenon\" with \"the X factor.\"School friends with explosive New Zealand cricketer Kane Williamson at Tauranga Boys College, Burling's teachers said he was always destined for the top.Occasionally, his inexperience has shown with the odd faulty start, not to mention the dramatic capsize against Land Rover BAR.But the Kiwi lad, who first sailed aged six in a $200 wooden boat bought by his parents, has embraced his \"pistol\" nickname.

It's a whole team policy where we have a belief in the collective power as a whole and not any one individual to get the job done.\"When it comes to the design of their vessel, technical director Dan Bernasconi -- who spent six years with the McLaren F1 team -- has been credited with the approach which has made them so quick.Massive effort from the #ETNZ #Cyclors and all the guys today.4th race goes to @EmiratesTeamNZ 3-0 pic.twitter.com/ViSTOE24Qe\u2014 EmiratesTeamNZ (@EmiratesTeamNZ) 18 June 2017 It led to praise from rival skipper Ben Ainslie, who told CNN: \"The Kiwis have been very aggressive with their design philosophy and that's really paid off. It's been great to watch.\"READ: How technology made America's Cup mainstreamThe most notable manifestation of that approach is the team opting for pedal power on board over the traditional hand-grinding approach.Mechanical engineer Tim Meldrum said conservatism among other teams had seen them opt against cycling on board.New Zealand managed to keep its radical approach secret until February, while suggesting rival \"sailors felt threatened by such change.\"But the team's research found that it created roughly 10% more power and the sailors' position on board was also much more aerodynamic.As a result of such innovations, other teams have reportedly been looking to sign Bernasconi and members of his design team with one eye on the 2019 America's Cup.'Rivals want us dead'The team has been described as \"a lone wolf\" on account of them being the only one not to sign up to the framework agreement for the next America's Cup and beyond.That agreement paved the way for the loss of government funding to the team -- partly down to an America's Cup World Series event scheduled for Auckland being shelved.It is thought the team have been rewarded by the America's Cup arbitration panel to the tune of $10m.Of that framework, Dalton says, \"We fundamentally don't agree with it,\" while prior to the event he claimed their five rivals \"want us dead now.\"Should the Kiwis add to their Cup victories in 1995 and 2000, it would be in their hands to decide the future of the America's Cup.Emirates Team New Zealand during day two of the Americas Cup Match.What is clear is Dalton and co. have made a habit of doing things differently, saying \"we're not here to play happy families\".But the threat of another Oracle comeback remains.

        "content": "(CNN)Five years ago, few people would have put trying Slovenian food on their bucket list.Nestled between Italy, Austria, Hungary and Croatia, the tiny country of two million people which takes just three hours to drive across, wasn't on the culinary map.But one female chef has thrust the Central European nation into the global limelight with her visionary gastronomy.Last year, chef Ana Ro\u0161 appeared on Netflix series Chef's Table and, in January, she was crowned \"The World's Best Female Chef 2017\" by The World's 50 Best Restaurants.The Slovenian chef has hired foragers to help her source local mushrooms, berries and fish. \"Voters (were) seduced by the stunning location, the charm of the restaurant and its service, but most of all by the originality, subtlety and sophistication of the food,\" William Drew, group editor of The World's 50 Best Restaurants, tells CNN. Read More\"She has almost single-handedly drawn attention to her region, its agro-economy, wine, culture and sheer beauty.\"With the Michelin Guide not yet in Slovenia, it was the highest culinary accolade Ro\u0161 could bring to her nation.Who is Ana Ro\u0161?A self-taught chef, Ro\u0161 helms Hi\u0161a Franko (meaning Frank's House) inn and restaurant in an Alpine corner of the Soca Valley, just a few miles from the Italian border. Her menu has been praised for its eclectic, original interpretations of Slovenian cuisine -- traditionally, a melting pot of influences from neighbors such as Italy and Austria.     For the past 15 years, the 44-year-old has worked to elevate her country as a gastronomic destination. Her achievements are all the more remarkable considering the male-dominated profession she is working in: while there are 125 male chefs with three Michelin stars, just five women have held the same accolade (they are all in Europe). Furthermore, women in top kitchen positions tend to earn 28% less than men, a Glassdoor report claimed last year.But perhaps Ro\u0161 has an advantage.Located in a remote part of western Slovenia, Hi\u0161a Franko is now the most well-known restaurant in Slovenia. When it comes to gender equality, Slovenia is the highest ranked country in the EU and 8th best in the world, according to the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report 2016. Not that that has safeguarded Ro\u0161 against sexism in the kitchen. Last year, she says she fired five male chefs in a  week after they questioned her authority.\"They did not pay enough respect. You can feel it, especially when you try to balance the energies of a completely new team,\" Ro\u0161 tells CNN.\"Their eyes tell you everything, there's no need for words.\"A diplomatic dilemmaRo\u0161 was raised in an ambitious family. More from \"Her\"Is she the Mike Tyson of MMA? Abandoned at birth, she fought racism to the topGraffiti queen delivers justice with spray canShe sued Rolling Stone -- and wonBiggest female voyage to AntarcticaMeet Nepal's rock star nunBorn to a doctor father and journalist mother, she was an excellent student and as a youth was on the national ski team. Fluent in five languages -- Slovenian, Spanish, English, French, and Italian -- she went on to pursue international diplomatic studies at university. Ro\u0161 was a plane ride away from starting a job as a junior diplomat in Brussels when fate intervened.The parents of her boyfriend, Valter Kramar, were retiring, and as the eldest son, he had inherited their restaurant, Hi\u0161a Franko, in the tiny town of Kobarid just down the road from where Ro\u0161 had grown up, in Tolmin. He gave her a life-altering dilemma: follow her heart back to the little valley with him, or continue on her glittering diplomatic career path.A family affairRo\u0161 chose love, but it came with a price tag. \"(My family) didn't want me to come back and be a cook and were ashamed that I was working with my hands. They expected more from me.\" Her father shunned her for six months. Her mother, she says, is still \"embarrassed.\" In Slovenia and across Communist countries, the idea of a cook is someone who can't do anything elseAna Ro\u0161In Slovenia and across Communist countries ... a cook is (seen as) someone who can't do anything else,\" she explains. \"The funny thing is that I am kind of an ambassador, anyway, bringing curious travelers and diners to experience Slovenia.\"  Diners come from as far as New Zealand, Australia and the US to her restaurant, which is also a favorite with Slovenian politicians and personalities -- even president Borut Pahor has payed a visit.Small town, big ideasWhen Ro\u0161 and Kramar took over Hi\u0161a Franko in 2000, it already had a full-time chef.Kramar, a sommelier, looked after the wine while Ro\u0161 manned the front of the house.She thought the restaurant held huge possibilities and wanted to see the menu evolve beyond traditional Slovenian dishes of ravioli and cottage cheese. \"We had been traveling the world and saw that things were moving outside this valley,\" she recalls. \"So I went very ambitiously to the kitchen, talking with the chef, and saying we should try to pair the pasta with some local cheese, or introduce some wine pairings. But he didn't really see the value in it.\"Ana Ro\u0161 and partner Valter Kramar age rounds of local Tolminc cheese for up to seven years.The existing kitchen team eventually quit, leaving Ro\u0161 to take the reigns.  \"That first time I opened the door of the kitchen, I closed it again. Then I leaned back on it and thought, 'Now what do I do?'\"At 30 years old and three-months pregnant, she had embarked on a new career: head chef of Hi\u0161a Franko. \"From then on, I was eating in the kitchen, breastfeeding in the kitchen -- everything was about the kitchen.\"Precision is everythingThe early years were full of fumbles. Without any formal training, she couldn't get raviolis to stay closed or bread to rise.  \"I kept asking so many questions. I always say that questioning yourself and doubting the quality of your result is the engine of progress.\"I am a woman, which is supposed to be weaker than a man and I am supposed to always ask men for advice. I am not doing that.Ana Ro\u0161Without any financial partners, her family's business was riding on her performance. Ro\u0161 soaked up pointers from her mother-in-law and a family friend, who used to helm a restaurant in the capital of Ljubljana before transitioning into academia.\"I was really like a sponge at the time, so thirsty for the knowledge,\" she recalls. After just two years, she was producing innovative dishes of a world-class standard and, in 2010, an article in Italian magazine \"Identit\u00e0 Golose\" brought her Europe-wide attention. Seeing starsIt wasn't until 2012 that Ro\u0161 really caught the eye of the global culinary community. It started with an invitation to join the elite Cook it Raw eco-friendly chef community, which led to talks at conferences, master classes, pop-ups and several appearances on French-German television program \"Happiness on the Plate\".Then in 2014, Ro\u0161 made a guest chef appearance at Ikarus restaurant inside Red Bull's Hangar-7 -- a pop-up eatery at Salzburg Airport, in Austria, known for inviting top chefs.Chef Ana Ro\u0161 subscribes to a \"1 kilometer\" rule -- sourcing her produce within walking distance of her restaurant Hi\u0161a Franko. International invitations subsequently took Ro\u0161 to places such as New York, where she joined the \"Gelinaz 'Grand Shuffle,\" an event where 37 international chefs swapped restaurants.But her biggest break came in 2016, when Ro\u0161 was profiled on Netflix's \"Chef's Table.\"After the episode aired, visits to Hi\u0161a Franko's website jumped from 200 to 10,000 a day. However, Ro\u0161 says Hi\u0161a Franko's success will likely stop short of a Michelin star. \"There are some candidates that deserve 1 or even 2 stars in Slovenia, but if Slovenia as a country remains so passive regarding gastronomy, as it has been up to now, all expectations regarding important guides coming to Slovenia will remain a dream.\"     Inside Ana's kitchenSlovenia has 24 gastronomic regions.In the northwestern valley, for example, mutton dumplings and cottage cheese ravioli are common rural dinners. But Ro\u0161 isn't interested in regurgitating the classics, nor does she subscribe to conventions like a \"signature dish\".\"I simply can't cook a dish I did two years ago, because I am a different person. My cooking style changes, because I am changing,\" she says.Ranging from $75 for five dishes and $95 for nine, everything on Ro\u0161's tasting menu is an invention, made from ingredients sourced within walking distance of the inn.

Read MoreDo Jong-hwan, South Korean minister of culture, sports and tourism, said he would \"push ahead for discussions with the IOC and other relevant entities\" in the hopes of hosting an \"Olympics for peace.\" Choi's suggestion comes after South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who advocates greater engagement with North Korea, suggested the two could launch a joint bid for the 2030 football World Cup. Unlike the World Cup, which has yet to be awarded, South Korea already has the 2018 Olympics, which are due to kick off in February in the mountain resort town of Pyeongchang, northeast of Seoul.

Despite Moon's public statements that he wants to improve relations with North Korea, Pyongyang has ramped up missile testing and continued its aggressive rhetoric towards its southern neighbor and the US. On Friday, South Korea tested a ballistic missile which officials said would be capable of \"incapacitating North Korean nuclear and missile treats.\" Speaking after the test, Moon said while he prefers dialog with Pyongyang, such a stance is only possible \"if we have strong defense.\" That missile launch came after North Korea reportedly tested a rocket engine.

However, an attempt to reach an agreement on co-hosting the 1988 Olympics, held in Seoul, broke down and North Korea ended up boycotting the games. Choi said that while he expected \"some resistance\" from Pyongyang, \"the Olympics is a very good opportunity so we cannot let this once in a generation moment slip by.\" John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University's Graduate School of International Relations, said the games were an appropriate venue to at least try to mend ties. \"The whole point of the Olympics is to use sports as a way to bridge even the most acrimonious political divides,\" he said.\"Given President Moon Jae-in's underlying belief in the need for dialogue, reconciliation and cooperation between the two Koreas, it certainly makes sense that South Korea would try some form of co-hosting. Whether Pyongyang is capable of being engaged is a question that can only be answered by trying.\"",

The non-binary pronouns \"they\" and \"them\" have been used in the singular form to refer to individuals who do not identify as a specific gender. \"LGBTI+\" refers collectively to people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, intersex or another sexual minority.   Ankara, Turkey (CNN) -- It was a warm summer night in July 2015 and Kemal Ordek, a sex worker at the time, was waiting at home for the next client to arrive.Two men, posing as customers, entered Ordek's apartment in Ankara. They beat Ordek -- whose gender is non-binary-- stole their phone and one raped them. At one point a third man, a relative of the other two, entered the apartment and demanded money.The men dragged Ordek, 32, out into the street and towards a nearby cash machine. There, Ordek spotted a police car and ran to tell the officers what had happened. The attackers followed, telling the police they were \"family men\" who had been lured into Ordek's home. They denied doing anything wrong.Ordek's version of events was dismissed by police on the spot, Ordek says. The officers threw Ordek and the men into their patrol car and drove to the police station. \"Don't even dare make a criminal complaint. I'll chop off your head, we'll kill you,\" one attacker said, according to Ordek.Read MoreKemal Ordek, author, activist and director of the Red Umbrella Organization Sexual Health and Human Rights at the organization's headquarters in Ankara in April.\nLater that night, police released Ordek's attackers without explanation.  Ankara police declined to comment by phone or text message, asking that CNN send its request by handwritten letter.According to Ordek's attorney, it was only after they filed a civil complaint, and sought legal representation that police launched a criminal investigation. For the next year, Ordek says the attackers unleashed a campaign of intimidation against them. Ordek also claims that pressure was applied by police to drop the complaint. Police arrested the attackers last November. They were ultimately convicted for their crimes and sentenced to seven and a half years each for looting. One of the attackers had faced 20 years in prison for aggravated sexual assault but his lawyer was able to get that charge dropped upon appeal. While the case gained support from human rights organizations and attention from the national media, Ordek's family disowned them.\"My father told me, 'you better get killed instead of being raped because this is against our honor,'\" Ordek said.Posters in support of transgender sex workers' rights cover the walls of the Red Umbrella Sexual health and Human Rights Association in Ankara.Although homosexuality has been legal in Turkey since 1923, Turkey has one of the worst records of human rights violations against LGBTI+ people in Europe, according to a 2016 report from the European Region of the International LGBTI Association. A separate 2016 report to the United Nations by Turkish LGBTI+ advocacy groups identified at least 41 hate crimes against lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender people that resulted in death from 2010 to June 2014.            Ordek survived the brutal attack, but many others haven't. In 2009, Eda Yildirim, a transgender sex worker was decapitated and burned alive; her breast implants cut out of her before she was murdered.  In 2015, another transgender sex worker died after being stabbed 200 times by a client.  In 2016, a young transgender woman named Hande Kader, a prominent member of the LGBTI+ community, was raped and burned alive. Her killer has not been found.  Even when identified, many of the murder suspects have not been prosecuted.Mustafa Yeneroglu, the Chief of Turkey's Parliament's Human Rights Observation Commission, told CNN that he had personally researched some of these incidents, but described them as \"mostly individual cases\" that didn't point to abuse of the LGBTI+ community. Highlighting that the victims were sex workers, Yeneroglu said: \"It should be researched sociologically and psychologically why these people are found in a criminal situation ... like (roadside) prostitution.\" Homosexuality is a biological disorder, a disease ... something that needs to be treated.\nSelma Aliye Kavaf, former state minister for family affairsBut Ordek -- the director of the Red Umbrella Sexual Health and Human Rights Association, an NGO promoting health and rights for sex workers in Turkey -- says that according to their research, roughly 90% of the country's transgender people feel sex work is the only way they can make a living.Betul, a transgender woman who asked CNN to refer to her only by her first name for her safety, spent nearly ten years of her life trying to work a \"regular job\" after graduating from university but was repeatedly sexually assaulted.Eventually Betul turned to sex work, but faced more violence than before. Last year, an organized crime gang attacked Betul in her home, nearly severing her hand from her wrist. After recovering from the attack, Betul pressed charges against her assailants, but the prosecutor assigned to her case was arrested shortly after, over his alleged ties to Fethullah Gulen, the Muslim cleric in self-imposed exile who President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused of being behind a failed military coup to overthrow him in 2016.Erdogan's riseLGBTI+ activists fear that the fight for justice will become even more difficult following Erdogan's referendum win in April which gives him sweeping new powers over the judiciary. Before Erdogan became Prime Minister in 2003, he garnered support by giving a voice to minority groups, including the LGBTI+ community, declaring in 2002, \"homosexuals must also be given legal protection for their rights and freedoms.\" But two years later, Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) removed the phrase \"sexual orientation\" from a draft law, describing it as \"unnecessary.\"JUST WATCHEDErdogan: What you need to knowReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHErdogan: What you need to know 01:42As Erdogan tightened his grip on power in the intervening years, activists say he and his government became more conservative, more Islamist and more homophobic.In 2010, then former state minister for family affairs, Selma Aliye Kavaf told Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, \"homosexuality is a biological disorder, a disease ... something that needs to be treated.\"In 2013, Erdogan described homosexuality as a \"sexual preference\" that was incompatible with the \"culture of Islam\" in Turkey. 'We're just passing days here'On a quiet lane in central Ankara, Ordek sat with peers who had gathered to discuss their future in post-referendum Turkey.A lawyer, who asked for her identity to be concealed for her security, told CNN that Erdogan used the referendum campaign to usher in a new wave of homophobic hate speech, and said the President is fostering a culture of police hostility whipped up by his extreme rhetoric. Erdogan's press office did not respond to CNN's repeated requests for comment. Hostility to the LGBTI+ community has also seeped into Turkey's pro-government news organizations. In the wake of the terror attack in Orlando in 2016, when 49 people were gunned down at a nightclub, popular among gay men, the headline in the far-right Yeni Akit paper read: \"50 perverts killed in bar.\"And in March, just one month before the referendum vote, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu told the former editor of Hurriyet \"to go and hang with faggots in the US.\"  According to a 2013 Pew Research Center Survey, 78% of Turkish people said they reject homosexuality. Today, the LGBTI+ community feels the government is unable or unwilling to prevent violence against them. Some say they fear that they will even be targeted by their own families. This has prompted an increasing number of people in the community to seek help, the lawyer said. \"If a family member decides to...kill you, they can because the government doesn't effectively investigate,\" she said. \"They turn their backs to these 'honor killings.'\"Yeneroglu, the head of the Parliament's human rights commission, told CNN that the commission will be meeting with LGBTI+ organizations to follow up on their concerns, but he did not specify when.Serkan, 28. \"The government's perspective on gender studies has changed.\"Serkan, a gay 28-year-old PhD student from Istanbul who asked CNN not to publish his last name out of concerns for his safety, said his university has also become more intolerant as Erdogan has tightened his grip on power.Serkan and his university's gender studies department is \"almost non-existent.\"  He says most of the academics in the department were fired following Turkey's post-coup crackdown, which has seen more than 110,000 people detained and almost 50,000 of them arrested.47,155 arrests: Turkey's post-coup crackdown by the numbers\"Since the purge started, the government's perspective on social science departments, specifically in gender studies, has changed,\" he told CNN. \"It was a hostile change.\"This atmosphere of fear permeates all levels of society, according to Tolga, a 21-year-old office worker who came out as gay only four years ago. He asked for his last name to be withheld out of concerns for his safety. Tolga, 21. \"I feel safe in the office, but not in general. We're just passing days here.\"As he lists a number of political upheavals -- from the 2016 failed coup to a bloody fight against the resurgence of a Kurdish separatist movement in the south -- Tolga fears that the LGBTI+ community is increasingly becoming a scapegoat as President Erdogan seeks to consolidate power and eliminate all dissenting voices.\"When I go to sleep at night, I'm always worried about what will happen the next day,\" he said.\"Especially under the state of emergency [which was imposed in July 2016], everyone is feeling particularly concerned in their daily lives. I have started coming to work from a street that is safer than my usual route,\" Tolga told CNN.Tolga fears that his way of life is being forced underground as Turkey's gay people lose public spaces where they can safely congregate. He cites the terrorist attack on a prestigious gay-friendly nightclub in Istanbul on New Year's Eve, and the state-ban on Ankara and Istanbul gay pride events last year.\"I fear I'm going to have to live a life where I meet with my friends in houses and in private -- I fear that socializing outside will stop,\" he said.He also worries that Erdogan is pitting what many LGBTI+ people see his increasingly Islamist conservatism against the country's traditionally secular, urban society.  \"The political situation changes in the country very rapidly, so I don't know what it's going to be like the next day,\" he said. \"I fear for civil war in this country.\"",

It's not just at the fortress Eden Park where the stats are loaded against the Lions. The All Blacks are on a record 46-game unbeaten run on home soil, the last loss coming in September 2009 against South Africa. There are few more daunting tests in sport, let alone rugby, than facing the All Blacks at home. Claims have been made that they are the best sports team in history, boasting a better win record than Brazil in football and Australia in cricket. \"It probably doesn't get much bigger, it probably doesn't get much tougher than New Zealand in New Zealand,\" Jamie George, an England player making his Lions test debut, told CNN ahead of the tour. \"There's been a huge amount of hype around the tour, and I think we're fully aware that we need to be at the top of our game if we're going to come away with the series win, which is what we're after.\"JUST WATCHEDBritish & Irish Lions: a hallowed traditionReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBritish & Irish Lions: a hallowed tradition 03:21READ: South Africa legend Habana makes surprise DNA discovery'No better team'The last -- and only -- Lions side to win in New Zealand was in 1971, when John Dawes lead the Northern Hemisphere side to an historic 2-1 victory. There have been glimmers of hope for the 2017 crop of Lions. They comfortably beat the Maori All Blacks -- traditionally seen as the tour's \"fourth test\" -- last week, and also ended the 14-match winning streak of club side Crusaders. The Irish players in the squad will also hold onto last year's victory in Chicago that ended New Zealand's record unbeaten run of 18 games.But recent signs show the All Blacks will be as ruthless as ever, as they thrashed Samoa 78-0 in their sole pre-series game. \"They're a great team, and they have been very consistent over the years,\" said Mako Vunipola, the Lions' starting loosehead prop for this weekend's game.JUST WATCHEDThe story of the 'greatest rugby player on earth'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe story of the 'greatest rugby player on earth' 02:26\"You want to be involved in these big games and you've got to go and test yourself -- and there's no better team really than New Zealand.

In the forwards, the likes of captain Kieran Read, flanker Jermone Kaino, and lock Sam Whitelock have all been mainstays in the New Zealand sides that won back-to-back World Cups in 2011 and 2015 -- the first country ever to do so. Imperious on the field, New Zealand sides are equally as majestic off it.The nation is steeped in rugby-playing culture, ritual, and tradition. The welcoming of the team, the sharing of breath, and the famous haka all form part of complex and elaborate pre-game routines. The haka -- the All Black's ceremonial war dance performed on the field moments before a game gets underway -- needs little introduction, while the ways teams face it vary. Irishman Rory Best, who captained the Lions during a warm-up game against the Chiefs, is presented with a Taiaha, a traditional Maori weapon, after the game.Ireland paid poignant tribute to rugby great Antony Foley, who passed away last year, by forming a number eight -- Foley's position -- while facing the haka in Chicago. At the recent under-20s World Championship, the French team remained unflinching, resulting in a minute-long stand-off between the sides that the referee was forced to break apart. It's for all these reasons that winning a test series in New Zealand carries significance beyond the sport itself. \"A legacy will last forever if you manage to win a series down there,\" Ireland legend Brian O'Driscoll, who captained the Lions' 2005 tour of New Zealand, told CNN. \"It's the toughest place to tour. It's just a matter of digging in, keeping your eyes on the prize, and knowing what a huge carrot there is at the end of a successful seven-week tour.\"Visit cnn.com/rugby for more news and videosCome Saturday, the Lions will be a step closer to -- or further away from -- that carrot.

As of Thursday evening, combustible cladding has been found on at least seven tower blocks in the UK, according to 10 Downing Street.Prime Minister Theresa May said Thursday that at least 100 buildings a day are being tested, with residents being informed of the findings.Grenfell Tower fire families to be rehoused in luxury complexEarlier, Downing Street had said that there were approximately 600 high-rise buildings with \"similar cladding\" to that used at Grenfell Tower in west London. But hours later, the Department for Communities and Local Government clarified that the 600 figure was in reference to high-rise buildings covered in any type of cladding, rather than \"similar\" cladding to that at Grenfell.Read More\"The situation is that 600 buildings have cladding -- it is not similar (to Grenfell Tower), it is all types of cladding,\" a spokesman for the DCLG said.\"Of these 600, we want landlords to check if they have ACM (aluminum composite material) cladding. Of those 600, some of those would have ACM; we want to test them to see if they have ACM.\"May says sorry to Grenfell Tower fire victims for lack of supportThe Prime Minister told Parliament that a statement on the test results of the cladding samples taken from Grenfell Tower would be made in the next 48 hours.Speculation has focused on the role that cladding apparently used in a recent refurbishment of the tower may have played in the fire, which appeared to spread quickly up the exterior.May said that 151 homes were destroyed in the fire. She said that 164 properties have been found to house displaced residents and are currently undergoing inspection.

I still am shocked but along with the other residents I'm suffering a combination of shock and anger,\" said Simon Morris.Sayed Meah said he and other residents were not aware of any evacuation plan should there ever be a fire.\"We've never had any fire evacuation rules, any plans, any procedures, nothing. So we're scared, we're genuinely genuinely scared of our lives,\" he said.A spokesman for Camden Council said a decision to take the cladding off had already been made prior to the government's announcement. Preparations for removal of the cladding from the five affected towers began Thursday. The council also is adding new safety measures, including 24/7 patrols in corridors, safety testing and smoke alarms, and testing for fire doors, he said.  Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the latest developments confirmed \"people's worst fears that there is a real risk that other tower blocks across Britain are at risk from combustible cladding.\"Council chief resignsEarlier Thursday, the chief executive of Kensington and Chelsea council, where Grenfell Tower is located, resigned from his post.JUST WATCHEDQueen reflects on 'somber national mood'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHQueen reflects on 'somber national mood' 00:46Nicholas Holgate said that he had been asked to step down from his role by Communities Secretary Sajid Javid. His resignation, which was welcomed by the Prime Minister, comes after accusations that the council failed to deal with the aftermath of the disaster.On Wednesday, May apologized for the government's failure to offer residents adequate support in the hours after the blaze. \"That was a failure of the state -- local and national -- to help people when they needed it most,\" she said.Her statement spelled out further how the residents will be helped. The measures include:Each family to receive a down payment from emergency fundEveryone to be rehoused within three weeksAn independent public inquiry to be chaired by a judgeAll those with an interest, including the survivors and victims' families, to be consulted and help with legal costs provided.May said it was clear that the local authority, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, could not cope with the disaster and that steps would be taken to improve future efforts.Luxury apartment complexAs efforts continue to find permanent housing for those made homeless by the fire, the government said Wednesday that 68 apartments in a luxury London housing complex in Kensington Row would be allocated to Grenfell Tower residents.An illustration provided by the Berkeley Group shows part of the Kensington Row development.The acquisition of the flats, built as new social housing within the swish development, was a \"significant step\" toward meeting its promise of rehousing families from Grenfell Tower within the local area, it said in a news release.Prices for apartments in the complex, located about 1\u00bd miles south of Grenfell Tower in a highly desirable area, start at \u00a31.6 million ($2 million) for private buyers, according to Britain's Guardian newspaper.

And what's so interesting to me is that we see this across the ideological spectrum.Brian Levin, Center for the Study of Hate and ExtremismCombating these narratives is a crucial step governments must take in order to prevent terror attacks from becoming force multipliers, inspiring dueling extremists to commit new acts of violence inspired by previous violence.It's what's known as \"cumulative extremism,\" a self-perpetuating downward spiral of violence that triggers more violent acts, a 2015 report from Teesside University's Centre for Fascist, Anti-fascist and Post-fascist Studies notes.And with four terror attacks hitting the UK in recent weeks, the risk of cumulative extremism is high.\"There's no big overall, strategic network except for the fact that I think energy and motivation by seeing one attack spurring another,\" former Metropolitan Police Commander Mak Chishty told CNN. \"What's different about this one is because this is on the other extremist level because it's a clearly targeted attack against Muslims. And what we don't want now is retribution. It's a call for calm amongst a great people of the United Kingdom.\" JUST WATCHEDRetired police commander on stopping copycat attacksReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRetired police commander on stopping copycat attacks 02:45The gray zoneA big part of ISIS' global strategy involves the response to terror attacks like those Monday.A 2015 article in Dabiq, the terror group's English-language magazine, explained why ISIS' goal was to get rid of what it called the \"gray zone,\" an area occupied by Muslims who aren't pro-ISIS and live side-by-side with others (which are far and away the vast majority of the world's Muslims.)Their hope is to turn the world into a black-and-white place: you're either with ISIS or you're an infidel, regardless of religion, and there's no in-between. \"ISIS wants to eliminate coexistence between religions and to create a response from the West that will force Muslims to choose sides,\" Muslim author Laila Lalami, the award-winning Moroccan-American author, wrote in The New York Times Magazine in 2015 shortly after the Paris attacks. \"Every time the gray zone recedes, ISIS gains ground,\"The worry is that with each terror attack, regardless of the perpetrator's motives, the gray zone is getting smaller.For ISIS, the hope is that Monday attack was a piece of fodder for recruits and something they'll likely point to as \"proof\" of the gray zone is eroding.\"This individual attack is more of a marker than anything else. Its symbolism is more important than its operational use for ISIS. They're going to use it, but they're so wildly unpopular in the Muslim world, it's going to take more retaliatory attacks and more kinds of overt discriminatory acts against Muslims to give them that traction beyond the relatively a small sliver of people,\" Levin told CNN. \"They're looking to create something broad, and they haven't been able to sustain that.\"JUST WATCHEDLondon Mayor: Zero tolerance for hate crimeReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLondon Mayor: Zero tolerance for hate crime 01:31Far-right responsesMultiple members of the Muslim community that spoke with CNN in the hours after Monday's attack talked of living with the constant fear of reprisal attacks in the wake of ISIS-inspired terror attacks on London Bridge and in Manchester.Research shows after jihadist terror attacks, hate crimes against Muslim communities often spike. That was the case after Manchester and London, police said earlier this month.The 2015 report from the Centre for Fascist, Anti-fascist and Post-fascist Studies claimed that its analysis found an increase in the reporting of anti-Muslim hate crimes in the seven days following an attack. The report's authors said they believe the relationship was causal. \"People are using terrorist means to now put fear into the Muslim community,\" community leader Abjol Miah told CNN Monday morning. JUST WATCHEDActivist: Muslim community has been terrorizedReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHActivist: Muslim community has been terrorized 00:49Anti-Muslim extremists did hail the attack online, but some of Britain's public far-right figures -- like Tommy Robinson and Paul Golding -- would not condone the attack. Golding and Robinson said it proved them right. Robinson, who says he has received a handful of death threats since the Monday attack, called the driver an \"idiot\" (along with profanities) and said the victims of the terror attack were innocent.But he also said the attack is proof of \"sectarianism\" and believes other similar attacks are inevitable.The worry from some experts is that calling these sort of attacks sectarianism alienates the Muslim community and feeds the \"us-versus-them\" narrative, further shrinking the gray zone. \"Terrorism will cost many people their lives. But there is also a second danger, which is just as great, if not greater: that our societies will become polarized; that Far Right parties and militant groups will gain in strength; and that ultimately it will become more difficult for people of different faiths and origins to live together,\" Peter Neumann, a leading expert on radicalization in the United Kingdom, wrote in his 2016 book \"Radicalized: New Jihadists and the Threat to the West.

And coupled on top of that is an anger that is culled from these folks who are disenfranchised and unstable people, who can be caught up in that net of the DIY terrorist,\" said Levin.  \"Extremist movements are like these planets that are hurdling through sociopolitical space, and they get caught up in the gravity of other moons and planets, and they are both reactive and reciprocal,\" said Levin.Follow Joshua Berlinger on Twitter",

It's not a great time to visit, President TrumpThe speech included eight bills centered on the UK leaving the European Union, and measures to address recent terror attacks in Manchester and London, as well as last week's deadly apartment block fire.The agenda is essentially a watered down version of the Conservative Party's election campaign manifesto, a document widely blamed for the party's loss of command in Parliament.The speech did not make reference to pledges in the manifesto to tax the elderly more heavily for their own care and cut back on free lunches for schoolchildren, policies slammed by opposition parties and the public.Read MoreTake a 360 tour of the Houses of ParliamentWhile the Queen said she planned to welcome the Spanish King and Queen in July, she made no mention of a visit by US President Donald Trump. The Queen invited Trump to Britain, but a date has never been set and UK media has speculated that the trip may be scrapped due to a lack of public support. May had hoped to officially secure support from the Democratic Union Party (DUP) of Northern Ireland, whose 10 seats in Parliament would give her enough votes to push her legislative agenda through. But as of Wednesday morning, no deal had been made.The Queen opening a new session of Parliament on Wednesday.The agenda appears to be deliberately modest in ambition and there were no real surprises, reflecting the Conservative party's weakened position in Parliament.Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, shot the agenda down as \"threadbare\" and sign of a government \"in chaos.\"\"This is a government without a majority, without a mandate, without a serious legislative program led by a prime minister who's lost her political authority, and is struggling even today to stitch together a deal to stay in office,\" he said in Parliament after the MPs were sworn in.What was in the speech?The Queen announced that the Great Repeal Bill would be introduced to convert all EU laws into UK law, allowing the country to decide at a later date which to keep and which to scrap.Bills on trade and customs will be introduced -- Brexit means Britain will try to strike new deals with the EU but also with other nations that it was unable to negotiate with while a an EU member. \"My government's priority is to secure the best possible deal as the country leaves the European Union,\" the Queen said. Peers take their seats in the House of Lords before the Queen's Speech on Wednesday. Parliament will also introduce a new bill on immigration. Immigration was the centerpiece issue in the campaign to leave the EU, and the government has promised to deliver a policy that controls the inflow.The Queen confirmed that there would be a full public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire and that an independent public advocate, who will act for bereaved families after public disasters, would be introduced. At least 79 people are presumed dead in one of the country's worst disasters in a generation.In light of recent terror attacks in Manchester and London, existing laws would be revised, but no new bills were announced. \"My government's counter-terrorism strategy will be reviewed to ensure that the police and security services have all the powers they need and that the length of custodial sentences for terrorism-related offenses are sufficient to keep the population safe,\" the Queen said.Queen Elizabeth II leaves Buckingham Palace with Prince Charles on Wednesday. While powers will be revised, there was no mention of police resources. After the recent terror attacks, May came under criticism for cutting 20,000 officers from police forces in her time as Home Secretary, and senior politicians, including London Mayor Sadiq Khan, have openly called on her government to boost police numbers.Corbyn repeated his call in parliament Wednesday for May to boost police resources and blamed the government's cuts to councils for the disaster. Corbyn had already said that his party could vote against the Queen's Speech and even offer up some amendments.The Queen's Speech lacked the usual level of pomp and pageantry, with the Queen ditching her traditional red velvet Robe of State and crown for a blue day dress and hat, and swapping her horse-drawn carriage for a car.She was accompanied by her eldest son, Prince Charles, after Buckingham Palace confirmed that her husband, Prince Philip, had been hospitalized with an infection.Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles at the House of Lords for the Queen's Speech on Wednesday. May's future in doubt?The Queen's Speech comes at a time when May's premiership has become vulnerable and the country's future uncertain, with negotiations over Britain's departure from the European Union having only just begun.May's own position has been called into question ever since her decision to call a snap election. Her attempt to secure a larger mandate ahead of the Brexit negotiations backfired with her losing her commanding majority.Survey shows youth vote surge in UK electionIn written remarks prepared for the first day of Parliament, the troubled Prime Minister began trying to undo some of the key messages from the Conservatives' election campaign, saying that social care would be addressed and that every school should be fairly funded. Parliament must pass the Queen's Speech in a vote, but with May yet to secure a deal with the DUP, she is aware that failure to get the speech through could be seen as a vote of no confidence.The Queen's Speech usually sets out the government's legislative plan for the 12 months ahead, but this year's is different. May's government intends to run a two-year parliamentary period to complete the country's exit from the European Union.CNN's David Wilkinson, Carol Jordan and Stephanie Halasz contributed to this report.",

The five-time major winner, 47, and his faithful bagman had been together for an unprecedented 25 years and were considered a bedrock of the game but they announced their mutual separation in joint statements Tuesday.Follow @cnnsport\n\nMackay, 52, worked for Mickelson for 41 of his 42 PGA Tour wins, all five major championship victories, 11 Ryder Cups and 11 Presidents Cups.

It was so cool to have a front-row seat.\"I wish Phil nothing but the best. His game is still at an elite level, and when he wins in the future (definitely the Masters), I will be among the first to congratulate him,\" added Mackay, referring to the Augusta tournament that Mickelson has won three times.The pair were famous for their on-course conversations as they studied a particular shot, with each offering impassioned opinions on the best course of action. The swashbuckling Mickelson, as the boss, usually won the discussion.But Bones was allowed one veto each year, which he added in his statement he was passing on to Tim. Phil Mickelson joked that vetoes were \"non-transferable.\"  Mickelson won three Masters between 2004-2010, the 2005 US PGA and the British Open in 2013, but has since had three seconds in majors to suggest he is still competitive at the top of the game despite his advancing years.The left-hander missed last week's US Open to attend his daughter's graduation ceremony but Mackay still went to Erin Hills to scout the course in case a weather delay on the first day meant Mickelson could make his tee time.READ: How Augusta row cost caddie's job with BallesterosREAD: Woods receiving 'professional help' to manage medsREAD: Woods arrested on suspicion of DUIREAD: Woods - glory and pain Photos: Koepka crowned championPowerful Floridian Brooks Koepka won his maiden major title with victory in the 2017 US Open at Erin Hills.Hide Caption 1 of 6 Photos: Koepka crowned championKoepka held off third-round leader Brian Harman (right), while Justin Thomas (left) faded after his US Open record low round in relation to par of nine-under 63 Saturday.Hide Caption 2 of 6 Photos: Koepka crowned championJapan's Hideki Matsuyama set the clubhouse lead at 12 under after a final round of 66.

A source close to the investigation told CNN the man's name is Oussama Zariouh.Soldiers on patrol at the station shot the man dead as he ran toward them shouting, \"Allahu Akbar,\" Van Der Sypt said, giving the most detailed account yet from Belgian authorities of what happened Tuesday night.Read MoreNo one was injured, but the partial explosion set off panic shortly after 8:40 p.m. local time as people ran for cover. The outcome could have been far worse, Van Der Sypt said, adding that the man's suitcase contained nails and gas canisters. \"It's clear that he wanted certainly to cause more damage than he did,\" he said.Flames are visible Tuesday night after a suitcase was detonated in Brussels Central Station.No suicide beltVan Der Sypt told reporters the man entered the station at 8:39 p.m., five minutes before leaving his suitcase in the ticket hall. The case then partially exploded and, with the luggage in flames, the suspect went down to a platform in pursuit of a station master, he said.The suitcase then exploded a second time, causing a more powerful blast. The man returned to the main ticket hall and rushed toward a military police officer, again shouting \"Allahu Akbar!\" or \"God is the greatest!\" in Arabic. He was shot several times and died at the scene, Van Der Sypt said. He was not wearing a suicide belt or vest.Belgian soldiers patrol Tuesday night near Brussels Central Station after the partial explosion.Van Der Sypt gave the man's initials as O.Z. but did not name him, in line with usual practice in Belgium. The suspect was of Moroccan origin, born in January 1981, and lived in the Molenbeek-St.-Jean area of Brussels, where his home was searched overnight, Van Der Sypt said. He was not known to the police for terrorism-related activities, Van Der Sypt said. He declined to say whether police were aware of him for any other kind of offense.The attack is being treated as a terrorist incident, and anti-terror authorities are heading up the investigation, he said.The explosive TATP was used in the November 2015 Paris attacks, the March 2016 Brussels bombings and the May 2017 Manchester bombing. TATP is a high explosive that is much more powerful than that used in the April 2013 Boston bombings. It is made by adding an acid to a mixture of acetone and hydrogen peroxide solution. These chemicals are commercially available in the West but TATP is tricky to make. Most Islamist terrorists who have successfully made TATP have received some form of terrorist training.Prime Minister: Belgium won't be intimidatedA witness who was inside Brussels Central Station said he heard two explosions and then heard someone yell \"Allahu Akbar!\" twice, followed by heavy gunfire.Armed patrols, including two bomb disposal units, surrounded the station, which was evacuated and closed Tuesday evening. It reopened to travelers Wednesday morning.Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel vowed Wednesday that terrorists would not intimidate Belgium, saying: \"We want to defend our liberty.\" The country will remain at threat level 3, meaning the threat is serious but an imminent attack is not likely, he said. A concert by the band Coldplay at the King Baudouin Stadium will go ahead Wednesday night as planned, with additional security measures, Michel said.There will be a heightened security presence through the day in train and metro stations, the Belgian Crisis Center tweeted. Public events will also have increased security. CNN's Erin McLaughlin and journalist Pauline Armandet reported from Brussels, while CNN's Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.

        "content": "(CNN)More young people in Britain voted in this month's election than in any general election in the last three decades, according to figures published by Ipsos Mori Tuesday. An estimated 64% of registered 18- to 24-year-olds turned out to vote, compared to 43% two years ago. And over 60% of them voted for the opposition Labour party. Predictions of a big victory for Theresa May's Conservative Party before the election were based partly on assumptions that most young voters wouldn't turn out.     Instead, far more young people cast their vote than expected, with 62% of 18- to 24-year-olds voting Labour, versus 41% of overall voters.By turning out in larger numbers than expected -- and mostly voting for Labour -- these young people contributed to an election result that shocked most pundits and pollsters. Instead of losing seats, Labour gained 30, while the Conservatives lost 13 and the parliamentary majority they had held since 2015.Read More\"Without a doubt, this 2017 general election will also be recalled as the event that captured the imagination of a new generation of young people who announced their return to the electoral stage in a way not seen in decades,\" Matt Henn, an expert in young people and politics at Nottingham Trent University, told CNN.Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn takes a selfie photo with young supporters during a campaign event on May 10. It's 'cool to vote Labour'Tom Davies, 21, is one of many young Britons who voted for the first time in the election two weeks ago. Britain's vote last year to leave the European Union had such huge consequences, he explained, and it showed him the importance of voting.Davies supported Labour, like many of his friends. \"It's becoming cool to vote Labour,\" he said. Movements such as #Grime4Corbyn may have contributed to this shift. Superstars of the grime music scene such as JME, Stormzy and Akala all tweeted, Instagrammed or Snapped their support for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in the days leading up to the election. Corbyn also appeared on the front covers of music magazines Kerrang! and NME with the headlines \"Take the power back!\" and \"We offer hope.\"THIS WEEK'S ISSUE!

Magazine (@KerrangMagazine) June 6, 2017\n\nLabour actively reached out to younger voters, promising to scrap university tuition fees, raise the minimum wage, reinstate housing benefits for under-21s and build hundreds of thousands of affordable homes, using targeted Facebook adverts to reach the demographic. And Corbyn himself called on young people to \"step up,\" register to vote and \"claim your future\" in a speech in April.Leah Ingham, 26, found the Labour campaign inspiring. She voted for Corbyn's party and, having never been a member of any political party before, joined Labour two days after the election.\"Feeling inspired by @jeremycorbyn and optimistic for the future!\" she tweeted.Corbyn \"seems to actually care about normal people and young people, which I have never felt before from any political party,\" she told CNN.\"I feel like we have somebody fighting for us now, and we can and will make a difference.\"'A win for democracy'A number of nonpartisan organizations and individuals also made it their mission to encourage young people to get engaged in the weeks before polling day.After the general election was announced on April 18, two entrepreneurs from London -- Jeremy Evans, 25, and Matthew Morley, 23 -- set up a website called ge2017.com that hosted a voter advice tool that was used 2.1 million times. Another ge2017.com tool helped students decide whether to vote at their university or in their home constituency and it drew 200,000 users.Evans believes the vast majority of people who visited the site were young voters.  One of the project's partners was Bite the Ballot, founded in 2010 to get young people engaged in politics.A Bite the Ballot event before the election. Co-founder Michael Sani is thrilled by the surge in voting among young people. \"It's a win for democracy,\" he said.\"Politics seems so far removed from everyday life\" for many young people, he said, who are often \"made to feel like they're not clever enough to participate.\"But with this election, he sees that changing. \"When politics becomes part of your (social media) timeline on a daily basis, when people you look up to or admire are talking about it, it becomes normal.\"",

Earlier reports had given the man's age as 48. According to multiple UK media outlets, the man is Darren Osborne of Cardiff.Earlier in the day, searches were carried out at a residential address in the Cardiff area in Wales, the Met Police statement said, and authorities confirmed that the van used in the attack had been rented from a car company in Wales. Read More\"This is being treated as a terrorist attack and the Counter-Terrorism Command is investigating,\" said Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism policing.Police are asking people who witnessed the attack to come forward.UK Prime Minister Theresa May also called the incident a terror attack when she addressed reporters outside Downing Street Monday. Earlier, she chaired an emergency meeting of Cabinet members, police and security personnel, the Downing Street press office told CNN.\"This was an attack on Muslims near their place of worship and, like all terrorism in whatever form, it shares the same fundamental goal. It seeks to drive us apart and to break the precious bonds of solidarity and citizenship which we share in this country,\" she said.What happened-- The incident unfolded as evening Ramadan prayers ended.-- Just after midnight Monday, a van ran into a group of people in London's Finsbury Park neighborhood. -- The driver of the van, a 47-year-old white man, was wrestled to the ground by people at the scene and held until police arrived. He is being held on terrorism offenses, the Met Police said in a statement. He's being identified as Darren Osborne of Cardiff, according to several UK media outlets.-- Muslim Welfare House CEO Toufik Kacimi said the attacker shouted \"I did my bit, you deserve it.\" -- Imam Mohammed Mahmoud of the Muslim Welfare House stopped an angry crowd from turning on the van driver, telling the furious mob: \"Do not touch him.\"-- The van bears the logo and phone number for Pontyclun Van Hire in south Wales. Authorities later confirmed the van had been rented in Wales.-- UK Security Minister Ben Wallace said the attacker \"did not appear on the security services' radar\" and \"we didn't have any prior knowledge of him from the security services.\"The investigation Police officers gather near a van on Whadcoat Road where pedestrians where hit Traffic incident in Finsbury Park, London.-- The Metropolitan police's Counter Terrorism Command forces are investigating the incident and authorities are asking witnesses of the attack to come forward to aid in the investigation.-- Searches are being carried out at a residential address in the Cardiff area in Wales, a Met Police statement said. -- Police said they believe the attacker acted alone, despite earlier reports from witnesses, who said they saw two other people flee the scene.-- Extra officers have been deployed to \"reassure communities, especially those observing Ramadan,\" according to London Mayor Sadiq Khan.-- The Prime Minister said police decided to treat the incident as a terror attack within eight minutes of receiving the first emergency call. -- Residents in Finsbury Park had criticized authorities for not declaring the incident as terrorism almost immediately. Police publicly announced they were treating it as a terror attack more than eight hours after the event. Victims-- All of the victims were from the Muslim community, police said.-- One man was found dead at the scene, according to police, but it's not clear if he was killed during the attack. Police said he was already receiving first aid when the attack unfolded.-- Two people were treated at the scene, May said, and nine others were been taken to three hospitals. Two of them are seriously injured. The community      -- Islington's Seven Sisters Road, where the attack took place, is home to at least four mosques, and would have likely been filled with worshipers leaving late-night taraweeh prayers. -- The Islington borough of north London, of which Finsbury Park is a part, is home to a large Muslim community. Around 10% of the borough's population is Muslim.-- Opened in 1994, Finsbury Park Mosque is an unassuming five-story red brick building in residential north London, close to Arsenal Football Club's Emirates Stadium. The mosque, which today operates largely as a community center, rose to international notoriety in the early 2000s, due to its links with Egyptian-born radical cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri.-- Abu Hamza, who was the mosque's imam from 1997 to 2003, was later extradited to the United States, where he was convicted of supporting al Qaeda and Taliban terrorists, and sentenced to life in prison in 2015. -- Since then, the mosque has worked to turn its reputation around and now operates mostly as a community center. Reaction-- Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu praised citizens who helped in the immediate aftermath of the attack: \"Their restraint in the circumstances is commendable.\"--The Finsbury Park Mosque \"condemns in the strongest terms\" a \"heinous terrorist attack\" early Monday, according to a statement released by the mosque. The mosque called it a \"callous terrorist attack.\"-- Mohammed Kozbar, trustee and mosque general secretary, said that the attack was aimed at \"killing Muslims returning home after Ramadan prayers.\"-- UK Communities Secretary Sajid Javid told BBC that \"clearly, from what we've seen and what we know already, this is a hate crime attack.\"-- London Mayor Sadiq Khan paid tribute to \"the fantastic response from the police and emergency services.\"JUST WATCHEDLondon Mayor: Zero tolerance for hate crimeReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLondon Mayor: Zero tolerance for hate crime 01:31-- Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said, \"We take all forms of hate crime and violent extremism incredibly seriously.\"-- UK Home Secretary Amber Rudd said, \"We must all continue to stand together, resolute, against all those who try to divide us and spread hate and fear.\"-- Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, said he is \"shocked by this horrific and cruel attack\" and appealed \"for people and the media to remain calm and respectful of those affected.\"--  Muslim Council of Britain said in a statment that \"ordinary British citizens were set upon while they were going about their lives, completing their night worship. My prayers are with the victims and their families.\"-- The head of Tell MAMA, an anti-Islamophobia group, says anti-Muslim hate crime in the United Kingdom has increased noticeably after the recent terror attacks in Manchester and London. -- British Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, who hosted an Iftar at his home last night for the local Muslim community, said \"we must never allow hatred to breed hatred.\" -- The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said \"the appalling attack on Muslims in Finsbury Park is an attack on us all and on the culture and values of our country.\"-- White House press secretary Sean Spicer said President Donald Trump \"has been made aware\" of the attack and the White House sends its \"thoughts and prayers\" to the \"victims and their families.\"CNN's Carol Jordan, Steve George, Alla Eshchenko, Katie Polglase, Ryan Prior and Darran Simon contributed to this report.",

On Tuesday the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France found that three gay Russian activists were discriminated against and their right to freedom of expression violated when they were fined for protesting against the law.Nikolay Bayev, Aleksey Kiselev and Nikolay Alekseyev staged protests between 2009 and 2012, holding banners stating that homosexuality is natural and normal, and not a perversion, according to the court ruling. The activists had appealed to higher Russian courts without success.Russia's Justice Ministry denied the law was discriminatory or that it restricted freedom of speech, and said it would appeal the ruling within three months, state-run media TASS reported.

Witnesses have told CNN that hundreds of gay men have been held and abused in detention centers because of their sexual orientation. In April a Chechen government spokesman called the allegations of a crackdown \"an absolute lie,\" and denied that gay men exist in the republic.Homosexuality was decriminalized in Russia 1993, but homophobia and discrimination is still common.Russia fails to protect LGBT people: HRW reportThe law considered by the European court was first passed in the country's regions but became national legislation in 2013.The court found that the law \"served no legitimate public interest,\" rejecting suggestions that public debate on LGBT issues could influence children to become homosexual, or that it threatened public morals. \"Above all, by adopting such laws the court found that the authorities had reinforced stigma and prejudice and encouraged homophobia, which was incompatible with the values -- of equality, pluralism and tolerance -- of a democratic society,\" the court document said. After the ruling was announced, TASS reported that the Justice Ministry disagreed with it, saying: \"The relevant acts did not establish any measures aimed at banning homosexuality or its official censure, did not contain any signs of discrimination and, in its general sense, did not allow excessive action by public authorities.\"The court decided by six votes to one that Russia must pay around 49,000 euros in damages and legal fees to the three activists.The court in Strasbourg is responsible for the European Convention on Human Rights, which applies to all 47 members of the Council of Europe, including Russia.But President Vladimir Putin in December 2015 signed a law that allows Russia's Constitutional Court to decide whether or not to implement rulings by international courts.",

        "content": "London (CNN)The driver of the van that plowed into pedestrians near a mosque in north London has been identified as Darren Osborne, 47, a resident of Cardiff in Wales, according to multiple UK media outlets.One man died and nine people were hospitalized following the assault, the latest in a series of terror attacks to hit the United Kingdom this year.The driver, a white man, was wrestled to the ground by members of the public and then arrested at the scene, officials said. He was being held on suspicion of terrorism offenses, police said.Eyewitnesses reported chaotic scenes as the incident unfolded just after midnight, when evening Ramadan prayers had finished.British Prime Minister Theresa May said the attack was directed at Muslims and condemned it as \"every bit as sickening\" as deadly Islamist attacks that hit the country in recent months.     Read More'I just can't believe that he did that'Osborne, a father of four, is originally from the English county of Somerset, UK media reported.The Press Association reported that Osborne's neighbors were shocked at seeing photographs of him after the attack.Police said they were searching a residence in Cardiff in connection with the attack. That address is in Pentwyn, where Osborne is listed as living, the Press Association reported. The suspect was not \"on the security services'\" radar, Home Office Minister of Security Ben Wallace said.Darren Osborne has been identified as the man who drove a man into a crowd in London.Saleem Naema, a 50-year-old taxi driver, and his young son said the man pictured was their neighbor.\"I know him. I've lived here for five years. He was already living here when I moved in,\" Naema said, according to the Press Association.\"If I ever needed anything he would come. I just can't believe that he did that. I am a Muslim,\" Naema added.Khadijeh Sherizi, who was also Osborne's neighbor, said: \"It is definitely him.\" \"I saw him on the news and I thought 'Oh my God, that is my neighbor,' \" Sherizi told the Press Association. Sherizi said Osborne \"has been so normal.\"\"He was in his kitchen yesterday afternoon singing with his kids,\" Sherizi said.\"I just can't believe it,\" she added.Attacker shouted: 'I did my bit, you deserve it'The suspect was first arrested for attempted murder and taken to a south London police station. Police later said he was also further arrested for the commission, preparation or instigation of terrorism, including murder.The van plowed into the worshipers on Seven Sisters Road, a busy thoroughfare in Finsbury Park, north London, near a Muslim community center and a mosque.Neil Basu, senior national coordinator for terrorism at the Metropolitan Police, confirmed witness accounts that the man found dead at the scene was already receiving first aid when the attack happened. He said it was unclear whether he died as a result of the attack. Nine other people were taken to hospital, two of whom were seriously injured, he said. Two other people were treated at the scene.Police believed the attacker acted alone, despite earlier reports from witnesses, who had said they saw two other people flee the scene.Muslim Welfare House CEO Toufik Kacimi said the attacker shouted, \"I did my bit, you deserve it.\" An imam prevented people from taking revenge on the man, he said.

Residents in Finsbury Park had criticized authorities for not declaring the incident as terrorism soon enough, and police only announced they were treating it as terror more than eight hours after the event.\"This was an attack on Muslims near their place of worship and, like all terrorism in whatever form, it shares the same fundamental goal. It seeks to drive us apart and to break the precious bonds of solidarity and citizenship which we share in this country,\" May said. \"We will not let this happen.\" Police and ambulance crews at the scene of the attack on Monday.The assault comes on the heels of an attack at London Bridge, in which three men rammed a van into pedestrians and went on a stabbing spree at nearby bars and restaurants, killing eight people. Monday's attack is the third in London since March involving a vehicle as a weapon against pedestrians.Emotions are high in the UK in the wake of a series of deadly terrorist attacks and a fire at a London apartment building that killed dozens. Basu said it was a \"challenging\" time for London and that the emergency services were stretched.What happenedWitnesses told CNN they saw a van driving at high speed along Seven Sisters Road after worshippers had attended late-night prayers at the Finsbury Park Mosque.Abdikadir Warfa said the van turned into an alleyway and hit a number of people before coming to a stop. Images from the scene showed a white van wedged against a traffic barrier at the dead end of a street.\"I saw a man, he was underneath the van,\" Warfa said, who described how his friends tried to lift the van to free him.He said as he attended the injured, others grappled with the driver as he tried to run away. Police guard a street in Finsbury Park after the attack on Monday.Ratib Al-Sulaman was sitting two minutes away when the incident occurred.\"Some big van ... crushing the people in the mosque. So we just run straight away, I see police, ambulance, people lying on the floor, and a van as well,\" said Sulaman.     \"Tough times don't last, tough people stick together\" #finsburypark #sevensisters #HopeNotFear A post shared by Lorenzo D'Agostino (@lo_dago) on Jun 19, 2017 at 1:02am PDT\nSaeed Hashi described how he fought with the driver, and how he and two others held him to the ground for 10 minutes as they waited for police to arrive. \"He punched me in the head,\" Hashi said, showing his bruises.The van used in the attack bears the logo and phone number for Pontyclun Van Hire in south Wales. CNN spoke to a man at the company, who said he was the owner but declined to give his name. He said police had instructed him not to speak to the media.     Warnings of anti-Islamic attacksFinsbury Park Mosque trustee Mohammed Kozbar met with interfaith leaders and said that an attack on one faith was an attack on all.London's Finsbury Park -- a closer look\"Those who try to divide us and who aim to spread hate, fear and division will not succeed,\" Kozbar said after a minute's silence near the scene of the attack.A statement released by the Muslim Council of Britain condemned what it described as a \"terror attack.\"Tell MAMA, an anti-Islamophobia group, had visited Muslim Welfare House on Friday last week to inform the community about the need to report anti-Muslim hate incidents and to consider their safety during Ramadan.Finsbury Park, in the London Borough of Islington, is a bustling, diverse area of north London with a strong Muslim community.On May 22, a suicide attack killed 22 people and injured nearly 60 after an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester. The attacker was motivated by Islamist extremism, police said.Police cordoned off the scene on Monday.The London Bridge attack was on June 3. That attack also appeared inspired by Islamist extremism. The head of Tell MAMA, Fiyaz Mughal, warned of reprisal attacks against Muslims after major Islamist terrorist incidents. \"We saw that very clearly after Manchester, a very high peak. We saw that clearly after London Bridge,\" he said.

He was sitting and holding him like that, people kept holding him.\"Mahmoud's actions in shielding the driver are said to have quietened a potentially dangerous situation, and helped save lives.Speaking to the media later on Monday, the imam downplayed his actions, insisting that he had not acted alone.Imam Mohammed Mahmoud (in white hat and tunic) told the media what had happened outside his mosque was \"a tragic and barbaric terrorist attack.\"\"There were a group of brothers who were calm and collected and managed to calm people down and to extinguish any flames of anger or mob rule that would have taken charge had this group of mature brothers not stepped in,\" he said.Mahmoud said he was in the mosque shortly after prayers when \"a brother came in, quite panicked, and said that somebody had run over a group of people and tried to kill them so we rushed out.\"\"We found about 15 to 20 people on the scene tending to the injured, administering CPR on the brother who is now deceased, and three people restraining the assailant,\" he said, adding \"they couldn't hold him down and push back the people trying to hit him, so we pushed those people back.\"The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, told Sky News earlier on Monday that the imam's actions in \"calming things down\" were \"what I'd expect from a good faith leader, from a good Muslim leader.\" Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism policing, told reporters at Scotland Yard he wanted to praise the members of the public who helped in the immediate aftermath: \"Their restraint in the circumstances is commendable.\"Mahmoud said he feared the attacker's words and actions were \"maybe proof that this demonization of the Muslim community at the hands of those who ... wish to divide this country and divide this great city has succeeded to some extent, in influencing the vulnerable and the impressionable into thinking that we're barbaric and that we are people who like to shed blood and that therefore we must be exterminated.\"But he insisted: \"This community of ours in Finsbury Park is mild-mannered, calm ... not known for violence. Our mosques are incredibly peaceful. Immediately after the incident, people were praying for the victims of the attack.\" Mahmoud said he hoped that people would continue to unite against extremism.",

        "content": "London (CNN)A series of deadly terror attacks in Britain in recent weeks had left Muslims in north London fearing reprisals, but they never thought that violence would happen on their doorstep.It was just after midnight on Monday when a van mounted the sidewalk and plowed through a crowd of worshippers walking home from mosques in Finsbury Park following Ramadan prayers.At least one man died and 10 others were injured in the attack, which police are now treating as a \"terrorist incident.\" A 48-year-old white man was wrestled to the ground by members of the public and arrested at the scene on suspicion of attempted murder. He has since been detained on suspicion of terror offences.A woman in a blue hijab walks past the five-story red brick Finsbury Park Mosque -- the scene of Monday's attack.Muna Mohammad was safe at home with her children when the attack unfolded nearby. Looking on at the scene from behind a police cordon hours later, holding her young son's hand, Mohammad says her family left Mogadishu, Somalia, to escape violence like this.\"We came here to feel safe. But look, we aren't safe. We're sick and tired of terror. When I wake up and look at the news it's always another attack. Why is this happening here in the UK?\" Mohammad, 32, asked.Read More\"One of my relatives, who is around 80, was injured in the attack. She was praying at the time,\" Muna Mohammad, who regularly attends Finsbury Park Mosque, said. On Monday morning, suited commuters on their way to work and mothers dressed in hijabs, schoolchildren in tow, streamed in and out of Finsbury Park Underground Station, just around the corner from the scene of the attack. The crowd was a cross-section of this diverse London area, which, despite ever-increasing gentrification, is home to a wide array of nationalities and backgrounds.The area is probably best known for Arsenal Football Club, and on game days at the nearby Emirates Stadium, the streets around this transit hub are awash with fans dressed in red and white.A policeman gives directions to people outside Finsbury Park station. Many on Monday morning were trying to navigate cordons blocking streets around the mosque.On most Fridays, the faithful stream towards several mosques in the neighborhood, home to a large Muslim community of mostly North and West African descent.\"I pray in front of the mosque on Fridays, but when it's full I pray in the street. In the back of my mind I've wondered if it's safe,\" Ali, who was at home during the attack, says.\"These days, a car is a weapon. It's pretty scary.\"\"We have seen a rise in Islamophobia ... as a result of all the terror attacks,\" said 34-year-old Sultan, whose relative was injured at Finsbury Park Mosque. \"Our mothers and sisters who go out about their daily lives, they are easily recognizable because they have the hijab and Islamic attire. They become easy targets.\"Many local residents were angered that the media took longer to use the word \"terror attack\" to describe what had happened here than it had two weeks ago, when three Muslim men rammed a van into crowds of people on London Bridge.In a statement issued around six hours after the incident, Finsbury Park Mosque condemned the \"heinous\" act and said they were \"extremely unhappy with the mainstream media not reporting this as a terrorist attack.\"British Prime Minister Theresa May said officers had decided to treat the incident as a terror attack within eight minutes of receiving the first emergency call, but the Metropolitan Police only announced they were treating it as terrorism more than eight hours later.\"We had Iftar [breaking fast] at the chief rabbi's home last night. Two hours later, this happens,\" Yousif al-Khoei, executive director of the Al-Khoei Foundation in London and director of the Centre for Academic Shi'a Studies, said. \"We cannot allow these extremists to divide us.\"Just three days ago, an Islamophobic hate crime watch group met with members of the nearby Muslim Welfare House -- located just feet from Monday's attack -- to warn about safety precautions during Ramadan.Iman Atta, director of Tell MAMA, said the group had distributed safety leaflets to mosques, calling for vigilance so that congregations stay safe.\"Ramadan is a time when Muslims are more visible and when there are larger congregations who attend late at night to pray after opening their fasts,\" Atta said, adding that mosque security, especially around entry and exit points, must be stepped up.\"Islamic extremists are going to use this attack for their agenda,\" said Hassan, who did not give his last name. \"We keep telling people that these attacks... Westminster, Manchester, London Bridge... that they have nothing to do with Islam. But this attack is proof that there is tension here.\"The constant specter of terrorism in London is something that Zara, 40, a Muslim and Finsbury Park local, has been struggling to grapple with.\"Since the recent attacks we've been scared,\" Zara, who regularly attends Finsbury Park Mosque and nearby Muslim Welfare House, says. \"We knew something would happen but we didn't know it would happen like this.\"\"We will continue. We will pray today, tomorrow, the day after. It won't deter us from our faith,\" says Zara, holding her daughter Mona's hand.In the wake of recent attacks, Zara decided to pull her young boys out of Islamic school, opting to teach them at home instead for fear that they might be radicalized.\"We hear about radicalization in mosques,\" said Zara, who like many local residents declined to give CNN her last name. \"They use these kinds of events to radicalize kids.\"Finsbury Park Mosque made headlines more than a decade ago for its links to radical preacher Abu Hamza al-Masri, who was sentenced to life in US prison in January 2015 on terrorism-related charges.Flowers are left outside the back entrance to Finsbury Park Mosque in tribute to victims of the van attack. But the mosque has since worked tirelessly to transform itself into an inclusive center for the local Muslim community. In 2014, it became one of only three faith organizations -- and the first Muslim group -- to achieve the VISIBLE standard, which recognizes independent community organizations that deliver services for local people and build partnerships with other groups.Zara says that now, more than ever, she wants her children to understand what it means to be tolerant and forgiving. Which is why she brought her 4-year-old daughter Mona to the scene of the attack to try to explain what happened.Ruweyda, 15, and her younger sister Ibtisam, 14, were trying to make sense of it all as they stood among locals and members of the press who had gathered at a police cordon outside of the mosque.\"When Muslims do something they call it a terrorist attack. But I made a bet with my sister they wouldn't call this attacker a terrorist,\" Ibtisasm said. The sisters, Ruweyda and Ibtisasm, saw the attack unfold outside of their window.The teenagers, who live across the street from the mosque, awoke in the early hours of Monday morning to the sound of a loud crash.\"I was in bed and I heard this massive bang right outside,\" Ruweyda said. \"My sister came rushing into my room. We looked out and saw two bodies on the ground. There was an old man under the van.\"The sisters said they were terrified as they waited to hear from family members who had been at the mosque for prayer.\"We couldn't go back to bed the whole night, it was too traumatizing,\" Ibtisasm said.Nearby, Selma Ahmed, 28, looked on at the scene in a state of disbelief and hardened resolve.\"Last night, when I was about to finish my shift, my friend texted me to tell me what happened,\" Selma Ahmed, a member of the Finsbury Park Mosque congregation, said. \"I couldn't sleep after that.\"\"I'm shocked that it would happen here. I've been coming to this mosque since I was a child,\" Ahmed said. \"I haven't felt unsafe until today.\"She says that since the recent attacks in Manchester and London, she leaves the house every morning wondering if someone will say something to her because of the way she dresses.One of her friends recently stopped wearing her hijab after being verbally attacked at a train station, Ahmed says. But she adds that Islamophobic incidents like these won't make her change who she is. \"I feel insecure, but one thing I'll never do is take off my hijab,\" she says. \"I don't want to give people -- people like the attacker -- the satisfaction.\"",

The crash left him battered, bruised and looking like he'd done \"six rounds with Muhammad Ali.\"But if it knocked him back, Koepka had at least one thing in his favor: some pretty impressive sporting genes.The Florida native happens to be descended from one of the most versatile American athletes of the 20th century, Dick Groat \u2014 a former All-America basketball star, two-time World Series baseball champion and MLB most valuable player.Not many can boast a great uncle inducted into the college hall of fame for two sports, but then not many have taken such an unusual journey to the top. 2017 US Open Leaderboard-16 Brooks Koepka (US)-12 Hideki Matsuyama (Japan)-12 Brian Harman (US) -11 Tommy Fleetwood (Britain) -10 Rickie Fowler (US) -10 Bill Haas (US)-10 Xander Schauffele (US)Leaving baseball behind him, Koepka took up golf, learning the game under the watchful eye of his father, before embarking on the European Challenger Tour in 2012. It was an experience that taught him as much about life as it did about the sport, and the young American went as far afield as Kenya and Kazakhstan as he cut his teeth and honed his game. \"I feel like I really grew up going over there,\" he says. \"Being 21, 22 years old ... traveling the world and getting to play golf is pretty neat.\"I learned how to play golf over in Europe; I learned how to manage being on the road.\"Coming out of college it's a little different: you've got to do everything yourself. I don't want to say I'm a slow learner but it was something that took me a while to actually master. \"Going over there was probably the best thing for my career and, when I look back on it, it's pretty special.\"READ: Is John Rahm the new Seve Ballesteros?Getting awayKoepka followed his first career title at the Challenge de Catalunya with victories at Italy's Montecchia Open, the Challenge de Espa\u00f1a and the Scottish Hydro Challenge. But before earning a European Tour card in 2013, those high points were punctuated by doubts.\"I have no idea why,\" he reflects. \"I played six, probably seven weeks in a row ... not being home.\"Golf's my job, it's not my life. It's something I've enjoyed but I also like to get away from the golf course. Golf's my job, it's not my life \u2014 Brooks Koepka\"I wake up in the morning, I go train and I go practise. It's something I do. You've got to have something outside of golf that truly makes you happy.\"Others in his place might have drifted away from the game. What's more, his mother, Denise, was fighting breast cancer at the time. But she told him: \"You have to be able to give a punch and take a punch, in golf and in life.\"He remembers taking a phonecall and receiving the best advice he's ever got: \"Stick it out.\"Such a mindset empowered the young pro, as Koepka went on to qualify for the 2013 Open Championship in Muirfield, finish a highly respectable fourth at the 2014 US Open in Pinehurst and secure his first PGA title at the 2015 Phoenix Open in Arizona. It has all led to this. Patience rewardedKoepka, a close friend and training partner of Dustin Johnson, received a phonecall from the world No. 1 late Saturday night, who urged him \"stay patient.\"US Open Past Winners2017 - Brooks Koepka (Erin Hills)2016 - Dustin Johnson (Oakmont)2015 - Jordan Spieth (Chambers Bay)2014 - Martin Kaymer (Pinehurst)2013 - Justin Rose (Merion)2012 - Webb Simpson (Olympic Club)2011 - Rory McIlroy (Congressional)Johnson might be a man of few words \u2014  with this year's champion joking the resultant two-minute conversation was among the longest they'd ever had \u2014 but the advice has paid off.READ: Why Dustin Johnson was 'fed up with being good'\"This week I never got nervous,\" says Koepka. \"I was always very confident, very in control of my game [and] in control of the way I was thinking.\"You know, walking up to the golf ball, I felt like every shot I was going to hit was going to be really good. Every putt I felt was going to go in.\"Koepka hit 88% of fairways and 86% of greens in regulation during his four days at Erin Hills \u2014 \"pretty sensational in a US Open\" in the words of Jack Nicklaus. Having started the final day one shot back from the lead, the big-hitting American mastered buffeting winds to card six birdies and a single bogey for a five-under 67, finishing four shots clear of Japan's Hideki Matsuyama and compatriot Brian Harman.After often commenting he feels like \"an underachiever,\" Koepka climbs from 22nd to the top 10 in the Official World Golf rankings.\"It's unbelievable,\" he says. \"To get my name on the trophy with the greatest players to ever player this game ... it's special.

He arrived only in time for the last lot, bidding blind the sum of $200,000 to see his horse race at Ascot the next day.As one of the Goffs team explained: \"It was basically so he could take his family to Ascot, get photos, show off to his mates and be in the winners' enclosure with the Queen.\"Quite which new owners will step up to the plate on Monday is another matter for the glamor event, whose sponsors include Rolls Royce, Selfridges, Claridge's Hotel, the private jet company VistaJet and winemaker Chateau Louebe.The full lineup for Monday's Goffs London Sale in association with QIPCO!

        "content": "London (CNN)A senior UK government minister said Sunday that he believed the cladding apparently used in a recent refurbishment of the London high-rise devastated by a blaze is banned in Britain for buildings above a certain height.Speculation has focused on the role that may have been played by the cladding since the fire tore through the 24-story Grenfell Tower in the early hours of Wednesday, leaving at least 58 people presumed dead.The government on Saturday promised a public inquiry and police have opened a criminal investigation. But angry residents, many of whom lost everything they had in the blaze, have voiced fears of a cover-up.\"My understanding is the cladding in question, this flammable cladding which is banned in Europe and the US, is also banned here,\" Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond told the BBC's \"The Andrew Marr Show.\"JUST WATCHEDAngry protests after London fireReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAngry protests after London fire 01:22\"So there are two separate questions.

It will also be a subject that the criminal investigation will be looking at.\"A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government told CNN that the use of a composite aluminum panel with a polyethylene core would breach current UK building regulations guidance, which says this material should not be used as cladding on buildings over 18 meters (59 feet) in height.However, the spokesman did not confirm what type of cladding was used on Grenfell Tower, adding that this would be subject to investigation. The company that installed the cladding, Harley Facades Limited, said in a statement Wednesday that it was \"not aware of any link between the fire and the exterior cladding to the tower.\"No sprinkler systemPolice said Saturday that 30 people had been confirmed dead since the fire, while another 28 remain missing and are presumed dead. Nineteen people remained in hospital as of Saturday afternoon, of whom 10 were receiving critical care.London fire victim was on phone with parents when she died, lawyer saysThe tower's cladding will likely be one of only many factors taken into account as investigators probe what happened. Authorities have also faced questions about why the tower block, built in the 1970s, was never subsequently fitted with a sprinkler system that might have saved lives as the blaze took hold.But Hammond said it was up to the public inquiry to determine whether the retrofitting of sprinklers to buildings was necessary to improve fire safety. \"What I am hearing from the leading fire safety experts is that it isn't necessarily necessary to retrofit sprinklers to make a building fire safe,\" he told the BBC. \"If something needs to be done to make buildings safe it will be done.\"Councilor Nicholas Paget-Brown told the BBC this week that sprinklers were not fitted inside the building during the refurbishment \"because that would have delayed and made the refurbishment of the block more disruptive.\" MP: Survivors' treatment 'appalling'Labour politician David Lammy called Friday for corporate manslaughter charges to be brought over the Grenfell Tower disaster and wrote to London's Metropolitan Police urging them to ensure that those responsible for the refurbishment were held to account.London fire: Smiling faces of missing a stark contrast with anger and griefLammy, who represents Tottenham in north London, has also expressed concerns that vital evidence concerning the refurbishment might be destroyed or lost before it can be seized by police. In a series of tweets Sunday, the lawmaker said survivors wanted greater transparency.\"Trust is very, very low. Contractors are removing Grenfell details from their websites. What else are they deleting?\" he asked. \"I was with the Grenfell survivors last night. They want answers, not a cover-up from the council and contractors.\"Lammy, who lost a friend in the fire -- talented young artist Khadija Saye -- also said that the residents' treatment by the authorities had been \"absolutely appalling,\" with volunteers stepping in to help instead.Corbyn slams responseLabour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn added his voice Sunday to a mounting chorus of criticism over officials' response to the fire.JUST WATCHEDHarrowing tale of brothers separated in fireReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHarrowing tale of brothers separated in fire 01:10Corbyn told ITV's \"Peston on Sunday\" that the local council, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, was failing to provide effective help for people made homeless by the fire -- despite being the wealthiest local authority in the country.\"Four hundred or so people -- still most of them have not got somewhere decent or safe or secure to stay,\" he said. \"Somehow or other it seems to be beyond the wit of the public services to deal with the crisis facing a relatively small number of people in a country of 65 million.\"The Labour Party is Britain's main opposition party.Corbyn's comments come a day after Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May said support for families in the initial aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire \"was not good enough\" and announced a fund of 5 million pounds ($6.4 million) to help those affected by the blaze.The borough said Friday that all residents of Grenfell Tower who had asked for help had been housed in hotels and that it was looking for interim accommodation for those people and others living nearby who could not return home.\"We want to rehouse people in a good home as quickly as we can,\" it said.Church serviceScores of people attended a service Sunday morning at the nearby Notting Hill Methodist Church, at which tribute was paid to those impacted by the fire.Flowers are placed outside the Notting Hill Methodist Church in west London on Sunday 18 June as a memorial to those who died in Grenfelll Tower fire. A message from the church's president, Roger Walton, read out to the congregation, said his prayers were with local people, adding: \"You are a symbol of hope in the dark days.\" Outside, many people lit candles and added flowers to banks of bouquets piled against the church walls. Posters appealing for help to find missing loved ones remain pinned to a green door, the smiling faces of those pictured standing in contrast to the somber mood.Missing people and informational flyers are posted on a door of the Notting Hill Methodist Church in west London on Sunday 18 June. Around the corner, volunteers offered counseling to those traumatized by the disaster and handed out donated food and water to those in need.London Mayor Sadiq Khan tweeted that he had attended an \"incredibly moving\" service at St. Clement's Church, also close by, and that it was an honor to stand alongside the community to pray for the fire victims. Speaking after the memorial service, Khan called the fire a \"preventable accident that didn't need to happen.\" He said the local community was frustrated and angry about \"years of neglect\" from the local council and successive national governments. \"There is a feeling from the community of they've been treated badly because some of them are poor, some of them may come from deprived backgrounds, some of them may be asylum seekers and refugees,\" Khan said.The government has said the country will observe a moment of silence at 11 a.m. Monday in remembrance of the victims.

        "content": "London (CNN)The only smiles around the blackened husk of Grenfell Tower are on the faces of the missing.Their pictures are everywhere, taped to walls or clothes, each with a name and a desperate plea for information. Children, their parents, young people, old people, different ethnicities -- the posters reflect the diverse community that calls this part of west London home. A poster for a missing girl is taped to a pole outside Latymer Christian Centre, one of several community hubs established for people affected by the fire.But as they smile from their photos, the other people gathering at the Latymer Christian Centre to see the makeshift memorials have tissues in their hands, their swollen eyes hidden behind large dark sunglasses. Here, flowers and candles line the foot of the walls. Well-wishers from the close-knit community have written heartfelt messages to place with their offerings. And above are so many of those posters.Read MoreKathy Lancaster, 70, travelled from east London to pay her respects at the memorial wall near Latymer Christian Centre. \"I thought I would be OK until I got off the train and saw that,\" she said, gesturing towards the charred remains of Grenfell Tower, \"all those children...\"CNN was turned away by several families as we tried to approach them to ask about their missing relatives. Always politely declining, the raw emotion of the situation etched on their faces. One young man gently waving us back, saying, \"I'm sorry, it's too soon. The time isn't right.\" Since the early hours on Wednesday, rescuers have precariously scoured the remains of the burned-out tower  knowing that they aren't likely to find survivors any more. Now they search for the dead.On Friday afternoon, firefighters donning florescent orange bodysuits could be seen bravely clambering from the rooftop inside to the top floor in search of victims.  A crowd gathers in view of the blackened Grenfell Tower.Knowing that people are missing and that others are risking their safety to try to recover them, puts the suffering of survivors into a grim perspective.\"We've been out of our flats, staying with friends since Tuesday -- no clothes, no money. But people are still missing and we fear for them,\" Nesrine Achiou, a mother of four who lives in the community tells CNN. \"One of them is the teaching assistant of my son who goes to nursery, Nadia. He loves her so much.\"She's talking of 33-year-old Nadia Choucair who works at the nearby Avondale Park Primary School. She had been at home with her mother Sirra, her husband Bassem and their three children on the 22nd floor when the fire broke out. The family haven't been heard from since.Related: London fire victim was on phone to parents when she diedCommunity members exchange information near a poster board for the missing residents of Grenfell Tower.In the absence of word from authorities, Choucair's sister Sawsan has plastered the streets and shops nearby with posters of her six missing family members. The gutted building still stands in the background like a dark stain against a brilliantly sunny summer's day. An ever-present and brutal reminder her family are still missing. \"I feel really angry inside. I can't do anything. I'm just looking at that building, I'm like, God help these people,\" Sawsan tells CNN. \"I'm just hoping they are in hospital, they've made it through the stairway, got out. Everyone not just my family ... every single person in there. I'm praying for them.\"Two people work to tape a missing person's poster to a tree near Grenfell Tower. But others in this part of the Kensington community -- like Achiou, the mom of the young boy in Nadia Choucair's class -- are less certain. She says: \"I've lost any hope because we've seen the scene: how they ordered them to stay in their flats, how they stopped people from going in to help. How can anyone escape that fire? I don't believe it.\"I saw people knocking on windows. Stuck with no help. Nothing.\" Dozens are already known to have died, and officials have said they expect that death toll to rise.Achiou says the surrounding community all know one another and laments the local council as unresponsive to their needs.  \"They don't respond when we need maintenance,\" she explains. \"They don't want to spend any money. This area is one of the poorest areas of the borough. If it was Notting Hill or Holland Park, then maybe this would have been prevented, but not us.\"The impact of the fire has been felt across the public housing estate that has the tower as its center.It was just after 1 a.m. on Wednesday when Emma Spinola stood in her nightgown, her eyes transfixed on the 24-story high-rise as flames licked the outside of the building. Within 30 minutes, it had been completely engulfed in a hellish inferno.   Just moments before, she and her husband Liniker had scooped their two young children from their beds -- leaving all their worldly possessions and the pets behind -- and fled their home in one of the blocks below the tower to safety. Emma Spinola talks on the phone outside Notting Hill Community Church as her baby sleeps in the front seat and husband Liniker minds their other child in the back.They'd been evacuated as a precaution. Fire trucks and police had arrived on scene and there were fears the fire could spread to surrounding buildings on the estate. As the hours passed, the crowd watched helplessly as smoke billowed from the building and some of its residents stumbled out. Like so many others there, Spinola wanted to rush forward and help but emergency services held them back. \"I was born on the estate, I've always lived there. And that's the only place I see as being home. I've lost friends in that fire -- it's just unbelievable,\" Spinola says standing in a borrowed dress outside a donations shelter.\"And why tell them to stay inside? That door is not going to hold a fire forever. It may work for half an hour but longer? That's not possible. And that's why we're all upset because as as a community we wanted to help,\" she says, suddenly incensed. Spinola stands outside Notting Hill Community Church after picking up donated supplies.Related: Harrowing tale of brothers separated in fireSpinola looks tired but determined. She says she hasn't slept since the fire and has come to Notting Hill Community Church -- one of the community centers that flung its doors open to help the dispossessed -- to \"beg\" for nappies and baby food. Like others, she hasn't been allowed back home and doesn't know when that will happen.Grenfell Tower: After the horror, anger flares in west LondonAn outpouring of public generosity has seen mountains of donations come from near and far. But the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea council, the management organization that oversees the estate and the UK government have fielded fierce criticism in recent days over its handling of the disaster. \"We haven't been able to get home since. We haven't seen anyone from the estate since this happened. The council didn't take any contact details, nothing. To be honest, I don't think they really care,\" Spinola wearily says as she half-heartedly swats some loose hair from her eyes.It's a feeling held by many residents of the Grenfell estate in the wake of the disaster. The neighborhood has now been pushed behind a police cordon, where charred debris and trash is visible in the deserted streets behind the tape. Many stood in clusters in the Friday afternoon sun along Bramley Road, angrily questioning how authorities could have allowed this to happen. Related: Is Grenfell Tower Britain's Katrina?Missing posters are taped inside the window of a local business on Portobello Road, a popular market street in west London.In the days since the fire, the central complaints from residents have been that social housing in London's richest borough has been inadequate for years and that the recent redevelopment around the Grenfell estate was to placate the rich who reside in the leafy streets nearby. Grenfell Tower is just a couple streets away from row upon row of grand Victorian houses and candy-colored terraces in the gentrified and highly sought-after Notting Hill and Holland Park residential areas. An ornate plant pot adorns the front of a home in the Notting Hill neighborhood.Several high-profile politicians including former Prime Minister David Cameron and Environment Secretary Michael Gove are believed to own houses in the vicinity. And while it may be the same borough, for many, it might as well be different worlds. \"I've never been anywhere where the divide, the disparity between rich and poor is so pronounced,\" says Danny Vance, the 30-year-old associate pastor coordinating community donation efforts at the church. \"You are literally a street's distance from million-pound mansions and social housing.\"Associate pastor Danny Vance (in blue, second from left) carries donated goods to a waiting council van outside Notting Hill Christian Community Church.

Vance said that all the work at the church was thanks to volunteers from all across London and until today, he'd heard little from the council.

A protester leads a chant, \"Justice for Grenfell!\" outside the BBC headquarters in central London.Back in Kensington, Vance continues to shepherd boxes to a council van as we talk. \"I think there has been this myth in society for probably the last 10 years that if you are poor, you are there because you are not working hard enough, you are there because you are trying to rip off the state... and now they are being called sponges and skivs and benefit dodgers when the people that we really know are dodging taxes are the rich. That's what we all feel like.\"He continues: \"Something has to change -- in this country, in this city. They cannot keep doing what they are doing to the poor.\"And with the truck loaded, he turns to thank the volunteers for their efforts and despite looking exhausted, smiles as he reveals his thoughts are starting to turn to Sunday's sermon. \"Jesus doesn't care if you are rich, doesn't care if you are poor but he stands with those who are broken and that's what our church is about,\" Vance says as he cradles his son in his arms. \"It needs to be something that's encouraging and hopeful but there will be anger about what's happened because this cannot happen again.\" CNN's Erin McLaughlin, Barbara Arvanitidis and Chris Jackson contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)A deal to prop up British Prime Minister Theresa May's government could come at the cost of peace in Northern Ireland, politicians have warned. Speaking in London Thursday after a meeting with May, prominent Northern Irish politician and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said he had told May she was \"in breach\" of the Good Friday Agreement --  the peace treaty which ended 30 years of deadly sectarian violence known as \"The Troubles.\"A unionist paramilitary mural in Belfast, Northern Ireland.Peace at riskFollowing a bruising election result in which her Conservative Party squandered a 12-seat majority in Parliament and found itself struggling to form a government, May has attempted to form an alliance with the far-right Democratic Unionist Party.Under the Good Friday agreement, unionists and Irish republicans like Sinn Fein entered into a power-sharing government. The UK government, which at that point gave up direct rule over Northern Ireland, was intended to be a neutral arbitrator between the parties. Read MoreBy forming a government with the DUP, many commentators have argued the Conservatives would undermine this arrangement and risk the peace process. \"There's a level of incompetence ... and lack of understanding by this government on Northern Ireland that is very troubling,\" Peter Hain, former Labour Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, told CNN. JUST WATCHEDFmr. UK minister: May has lost control of Brexit ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFmr. UK minister: May has lost control of Brexit  10:37His comments echoed those of former Conservative Prime Minister John Major, who warned earlier this week that May's actions put the \"fragile\" peace at risk. \"A fundamental part of that peace process is that the UK government needs to be impartial between all the competing interests in Northern Ireland,\" he told the BBC. \"And the danger is that however much any government tries, they will not be seen to be impartial if they are locked into a parliamentary deal at Westminster with one of the Northern Ireland parties.\"\"The peace process, which was very hard earned over very many years by a lot of people, people shouldn't regard it as a given. It isn't certain, it is under stress. It is fragile,\" he said. A woman walks past a loyalist mural, depicting an Ulster Freedom Fighter (UFF) in Belfast. What were 'The Troubles'? More than 3,600 people died in sectarian violence between 1968 and 1998 as unionist and republican terrorist groups carried out bombings, assassinations and other crimes. The fighting had its roots in a centuries-old dispute between the UK and the Republic of Ireland over control over the northern part of the island. Britain colonized the entirety of Ireland beginning in the 1600s, and it was incorporated into the UK in 1801. In 1920, guerrilla warfare between what became known as the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and unionists led to the partitioning of Northern Ireland and the future Republic of Ireland.Unionists are typically Protestants, who want to keep Northern Ireland as a part of the UK, while republicans are mostly Catholic and favor a united Ireland.Republican protesters throw stones at British soldiers in 2002. Republicans in Northern Ireland, around 35% of the population at the time, did not accept the partition and some adopted armed struggle as a way to break away from the UK.Militant activity by the IRA and other republican groups sparked a rise in Unionist paramilitary and terrorist organizations, as well as a forceful and often brutal response by the British Army, which sent thousands of troops to occupy the country. Bloody Sunday -- a January 1972 shooting in Derry of 14 unarmed republican activists by the British Army -- was a flashpoint in the conflict.In 1985, the IRA attempted to assassinate then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher with a time-delay bomb planted at the hotel she and her cabinet were staying at in Brighton. Thatcher escaped injury, though five people were killed including a sitting Conservative MP.The IRA also carried out a large-scale bombing campaign targeting major cities throughout the UK mainland, including deadly attacks in London and Birmingham. Ceasefire negotiations began in the 1980s, eventually culminating in the Good Friday Agreement, which was negotiated by the governments of the UK, US and Ireland, as well as representatives of Northern Ireland groups.Flames leap from Westminster Hall at the House of Commons in London after an IRA bombing in 1974. Political chaosNorthern Ireland: UK government may have to consider direct ruleBoth Sinn Fein and the DUP have their roots in \"The Troubles.\" Sinn Fein, a left-wing liberation party modeled on similar movements in South Africa and the Palestinian territories, was originally formed as the political wing of the IRA.The DUP are a far-right Christian party founded by Protestant preacher Ian Paisley in 1971. The party has historical links to unionist paramilitary groups, and during the 2017 election campaign some of its candidates were endorsed by the Loyalist Communities Council, which is supported by several militant organizations. Under the Good Friday Agreement, unionist and republican parties are supposed to form a power-sharing administration that governs Northern Ireland. However, in January, Sinn Fein pulled out of the government over a corruption scandal involving DUP leader Arlene Foster, who is currently negotiating with May. That has left the region without a government for five months. Sinn Fein and others have argued that any deal in which the DUP formed part of a UK government would worsen the current situation. Rule over Northern Ireland is due to revert to London if parties fail to reach a deal on a power-sharing government, but what that means for the country if the DUP is a part of that government at Westminster remains to be seen.

        "content": "Story highlightsOpposition MPs slam government for failing to conduct a fire safety review since 2009 fireGovernment claims that the review is still ongoing and that it has taken some measuresLondon (CNN)Britain will inspect tower blocks across the country after a deadly blaze at a London apartment building raised fears of similar catastrophes in other high rises.The inspections could involve hundreds of buildings, as London Mayor Sadiq Khan announced that checks would made be on tower blocks undergoing refurbishment.Residents and community representatives want to know how Wednesday's blaze was able to climb all the way up the 24-story Grenfell Tower so rapidly, trapping residents inside. At least 17 people have been confirmed dead and that number is likely to rise, officials say. Some bodies may never be identified, according the London Metropolitan police.Councilor Nicholas Paget-Brown told the BBC that sprinklers were not fitted inside the building during a 2015/16 refurbishment \"because that would have delayed and made the refurbishment of the block more disruptive.\" Read MoreHe added that the cladding fitted to the outside of the tower -- and blamed by many residents for helping spread the fire -- would not be used again. According to the Times of London, the cladding's manufacturer said its use is banned in the US on high-rise buildings \"because of the fire and smoke spread.\" Theresa May's government criticizedAs teams in London continue to carry out a recovery operation, British politicians have begun pointing the finger at their opponents. One figure coming under scrutiny is Prime Minister Theresa May's newly appointed chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, who served as housing minister until he lost his seat in last week's snap general election.Is Grenfell Tower Britain's Katrina? Barwell had told lawmakers that the government intended to review fire safety standards following a deadly blaze at the Lakanal House high-rise building in south London in 2009, in which three women and three children died. In that case, exterior paneling helped the fire spread.Jim Fitzpatrick, an MP with the main opposition Labour Party, slammed the Conservative-led government for shuffling its feet on the review, which has not yet been published.He said that he and a parliamentary group that he chairs have been pushing for better safety regulations since the 2009 fire. \"This kind of event shouldn't be happening, but it takes money and it takes political will,\" Fitzpatrick, a former fire minister and firefighter, told CNN. \"Engineering solutions of suppression systems like fire sprinklers could have prevented this fire from taking hold and would have prevented anyone from dying ... Nobody dies in fires in sprinklered buildings.\"A woman tries to locate a missing relative on Wednesday after the fire engulfed Grenfell Tower.The Department of Communities and Local Government rejected Fitzpatrick's comments that the Conservative government had sat on the review, saying it was \"simply not true\" and that the work was ongoing.\"Following the Lakanal House fire, the coroner recommended the guidance relating to fire safety within the building regulations (be) simplified,\" it said in a statement. \"The coroner also asked (the) government to write to councils encouraging them to consider retro-fitting sprinklers, which we did shortly after.\"Materials questionedThe country's Policing and Fire Minister Nick Hurd said authorities were in the process of identifying towers that might be in a similar process of refurbishment. They will \"run a system of checks and inspections so that we can as quickly as possible provide assurance to people,\" he said.Inspections will likely look at any cladding used. Documents show that aluminium composite material (ACM) was used in Grenfell Tower's rainscreen cladding. ACM is essentially a sandwich of two aluminium sheets with materials for insulation inside.

        "content": "Story highlightsKhan was a month on the job when London voted to stay in EU, but his country did notHis predecessor had the Olympics and Queen's Diamond Jubilee to overseeKhan has led his city after terror attacks and a horrific fireLondon (CNN)London mayor Sadiq Khan felt the full force of residents' anger and grief over the Grenfell Tower block disaster Thursday night, including a young boy on someone's shoulders who shouted: \"How many children died? What are you going to do about it?\"The poignancy of this question coming from someone so young -- with many families feared among the victims -- was lost on no one. The mayor told the boy: \"I know you're angry and we're going to get answers,\" but this reassurance did not stop other residents, angry over the disaster itself and problems over coordination of the relief effort, heckling as the mayor tried to speak.Mayor Sadiq Khan applauds at the re-opening of Borough market before going to see the aftermath of the tower fire.Despite the angry confrontation, at least Khan met residents face to face -- unlike British Prime Minister Theresa May, who was criticized for making a private visit to the scene Thursday, meeting only police officers and firefighters. On Friday, May's office announced she would be visiting victims in a nearby hospital. The mayor's response -- to keep talking to Londoners even in the face of anger -- is in keeping with a man who has shared in the city's many traumas over the past few months.Within hours of the devastating tower fire in west London on Wednesday, Khan was due to attend a ceremony to mark the reopening of Borough Market, the site of the terrorist attack just 11 days earlier. The event was intended to be one of unity and defiance against the attackers who murdered eight people in the food market and on nearby London Bridge. Read MoreInstead the occasion took on a renewed sense of sadness as the blaze at the tower block still raged a few miles away.These two disasters, together with the Westminster Bridge attack back in March, have given the capital more than its fair share of trauma in the past few months. For Khan, they have contributed towards a testing first year in office.Major incident declared at Grenfell Tower in Kensington. 40 fire engines & 200 firefighters at the scene - follow @LondonFire for updates.\u2014 Mayor of London (@MayorofLondon) June 14, 2017\nThe mayor had been woken up by senior City Hall and fire officials in the early hours of the morning to be told that an uncontrollable fire was ripping through the 24-story Grenfell Tower in North Kensington. He tweeted shortly afterwards that a \"major incident\" had been declared. He was briefed by the city's \"gold command\" -- the highest level of police and emergency service officials. Despite the unfolding tragedy, Khan was determined to go ahead with the poignant visit to Borough Market, where he had to deliver a statement detailing how yet another tragedy had befallen the city.His response was more personal than political: he spoke of how he was \"truly devastated to see the horrific scenes of the major fire at Grenfell Tower in Kensington.\" Sadiq Khan leaves the Notting Hill Methodist Church after visiting victims of the tower block blaze and those trying to help them.Visiting the scene of the fire after the Borough Market ceremony, there was anger in Khan's comments too, saying he would demand questions were answered at how the tragedy could have happened. His emotional response underscores how Khan is seen as a Londoner first, politician second.

His first home, where he lived with his parents and seven siblings, was a modest three-bedroom council flat in a community not dissimilar to the neighborhood where the fire struck.His mayoral campaign of 2016 -- which followed 11 years as an MP including several as a minister in the last Labour government -- was built on addressing inequality and uniting different communities in the city. Khan, London's first ethnic minority mayor, has a down-to-earth style -- which helped him win the most votes any individual politician in the UK has ever received.His low-key style contrasts sharply with his predecessor, now Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, whose flamboyance and humor always prompted doubts over whether he was a serious enough politician to oversee a city in tough times. It turns out he didn't need to. While Johnson had the 2012 Olympics and Queen's Diamond Jubilee in his city, Khan's first year has been overshadowed by more tragedy than in Johnson's eight years in office.A month after Khan's election, the UK voted for Brexit and during his first year there have been fears over how London will change once the country leaves the EU -- particularly its financial sector, heavily dependent on trade with Europe.As a Londoner and as the city's first Muslim mayor, Khan has been able to provide a unifying voice in the aftermath of each of these tragedies. Addressing a vigil held after the London Bridge attack, the mayor gave a powerful speech denouncing the attackers, saying: \"As a proud and patriotic British Muslim I say this, you do not commit these disgusting acts in my name.\"Your perverse ideology has nothing to do with the true values of Islam. You will never succeed in dividing our city.\" JUST WATCHEDLondon mayor: No time for Trump's tweetReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLondon mayor: No time for Trump's tweet 01:12And after the Grenfell Tower fire, Khan will be able to provide an important link between a community angry at being neglected and those in positions of power.After the London Bridge attack earlier this month, Khan tried to reassure Londoners that, despite some media reports, the city was not reeling or under siege, and said there was \"no reason to be alarmed\" by increased police presence. This comment drew an extraordinarily sharp rebuke from US President Donald Trump on Twitter. When the mayor responded by saying his remarks had been taken out of context because he had been referring to the enhanced police presence, Trump tweeted: \"Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his 'no reason to be alarmed' statement. MSM is working hard to sell it!\" At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is \"no reason to be alarmed!\"\u2014 Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017\nTheir feud escalated when Khan said the UK should not \"roll out the red carpet\" for President Trump, which may have contributed to the White House reportedly delaying a forthcoming state visit (a report the administration has denied). The dispute also showed how strongly Khan feels about his city as it endures difficult times.",

Organizers handed out fliers that read, \"Your anger must be heard.\" The protesters eventually made their way to busy Oxford Circus, where they staged a sit-in.Theresa May, Britain's embattled Prime Minister, visiting nearby, was bundled away by security guards after protesters converged on the street. May has already faced criticism for failing to meet residents when she made a low-key visit to the scene Thursday.The UK government, which has already promised a full public inquiry, announced a fund of 5 million British pounds ($6.4 million) to help those affected by the blaze.Some protesters managed to get inside the building.London Mayor Sadiq Khan demanded that the government publish a list by the end of Friday of other tower blocks checked by investigators. In a letter to May, he listed a litany of residents' concerns, including a lack of information about missing relatives, the chaotic response of the local council and worries over safety in other tower blocks. \"They feel the government and local council haven't done enough to help them in the aftermath of this horrific incident, or to provide answers to their increasingly urgent questions,\" Khan wrote in the letter.Residents are furious that many of the victims have not yet been found or identified, and they believe authorities have been downplaying the number of victims. They say their long-standing concerns over fire safety at Grenfell Tower were not adequately addressed.Prime Minister Theresa May was criticized for a low-key visit to the disaster scene.Anger on the streetsOne of the speakers at Friday afternoon's protest in West London, Mustafa Al Mansur, told reporters that people were unsatisfied with the official response to the fire.Al Mansur said there are still many unknown details, such as information about the contractors who worked on the building's renovation in 2015 and 2016.London Grenfell Tower fire: Help those who lost everythingHe also said the tragedy underscores some of the lingering issues of inequality that have roiled Britain in recent years.\"This is the richest borough in the UK but we have a building where some of the poorest people live,\" he said in an interview. \"The safety measures are totally inadequate.\"He said the council spent money on the recent renovation merely \"to decorate the exterior\" so that it would \"look better for the rich neighbors.\"He said there needs to be an independent inquiry, adding, \"People are calling it a corporate manslaughter.\"At the Home Office, protesters stood outside with signs and made speeches. The crowd included a heavy presence of union members, representatives of Socialist and Marxist groups, and students.The crowd then began marching toward 10 Downing Street, the official home of the British Prime Minister. They gathered at the gates that bar access to the street and kept up a barrage of chants: \"Blood on your hands\" and \"May must go.\"When the protesters moved on to Oxford Circus, they staged a sit-down protest amid commuters and shoppers. The protest brought the busy retail area to a standstill. At least one scuffle broke out on heavily-trafficked Regent Street nearby.Protesters gather at Kensington Town Hall on Friday afternoon.Police identify fire's originPolice have opened a criminal investigation into the circumstances of the blaze. They said they have examined the apartment where the fire started and \"there is nothing to suggest the fire was started deliberately,\" but a team of senior detectives is investigating whether other offenses were committed.One London member of Parliament has called for corporate manslaughter charges after learning flammable material was used to clad the building during the recent renovation. No sprinkler system was installed.Queen Elizabeth II meets members of the community affected by the fire at Grenfell Tower in west London.Queen Elizabeth II and Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, visited the area to meet residents and community representatives Friday.Metropolitan Police Commander Stuart Cundy said there is \"a risk that sadly we may not be able to identify everybody.\" He said 24 people are still hospitalized, with 12 of them in critical care.

READ: America's Cup boats sailing on the edge of safetyRead MoreTV technologyBut television also played its part -- a sometimes unfathomable race suddenly became a whole lot easier to understand thanks to onscreen graphics.Lines were painted across the water to mark the start, likewise for the racing position between the two boats and the boundary they cannot cross. Other technological twists included a boat's \"FlyTime\" in a race, in effect how much time it spends gliding out of the water in a race. The target obviously being 100%.As Mark Sheffield, the head of technology for the America's Cup puts it in the days leading up to the this year's match, \"What it's done is make something hard to understand that much easier to understand.\"The technology hub for the America's CupThat the America's Cup has got to this point is down to a conversation on board Syonara, the launching pad for Ellison's foray into the sailing world, in 1995.Stan Honey is a well revered navigator who helped win the Volvo Ocean Race and for a time boasted the speed record for sailing around the globe on board Groupama 3.But Honey has also made an impact inside American homes with his work on graphics for sports broadcasts. Notably the onscreen line put into a hockey puck to better see its movement, to the first down line in the NFL.Events such as Nascar and the Olympics have benefited from Honey's pioneering innovations.READ: The Olympic cyclist who pedals on water'Getting the band back together'\"I was a navigator for Larry on Syonara back in 1995, and at the time I was head of technology of Newscorp,\" he explains having sold his first company Etak to Rupert Murdoch in 1989 for $35 million.

I explained it had more to gain than other sports in technology terms because it's hard to understand and see. \"Translate the first-down line in NFL into sailing and you can see the boats' position in a race. He understood it straight away.\"Ellison appeared to store the idea in his head for 15 years. Honey was sailing the Southern Ocean when he got a message from his wife Sally to tell him something could be in the offing.He picks up the story: \"She sent me this Fortune article after Larry had just won the 2010 America's Cup and he name checked me.\"Ellison credited Honey's work in the NFL and said he needed his computer technology to help transform the America's Cup.Honey warned the American billionaire the technology was probably too expensive but Ellison isn't a man to take no for an answers. Neither Honey nor the America's Cup will divulge the cost in question but it is likely to run into the millions of dollars.Within months of hearing his name, Honey had \"got the band back together.\"He reunited with his cohorts Ken Milnes, Time Heidmann, Graeme Winn and Alistair Green, as well as bringing in Sheffield, who would later replace him as head of technology for this year's America's Cup.\"This was dream come true stuff for me,\" explains Honey. \"My two passions are the engineering side of things and the sailing side of things and this brought them together as one.    Nothing like an evening on the water in our @AmericasCup Class boat. Working hard for a #ThreePeat. FOUR days to the match. We're #allin! #thereisnosecond \ud83d\udcf8 @samgreenfield / ORACLE TEAM USA A post shared by ORACLE TEAM USA (@oracleteamusa) on Jun 13, 2017 at 8:08am PDT\n\"And since we were all older and wiser, this proved the perfect project. We were on budget, and on time. It worked like a dream.\"And the results have been truly eye catching, with tracking, telemetry and augmented reality systems all now developed.Crazy ideasAlong came automatic tracking systems on the boat, computer controlled cameras on the helicopters, and measurements accurate to within two centimeters.Honey and his team had helped turn the oldest sporting trophy in the world into arguably the most technologically advanced.So every gibe is registered, the average speed collated and the flight time and the positioning of the boats measured. But in addition, such technology has enabled the umpires to make more accurate calls.Honey has now taken a step back but he is almost childlike in his enthusiasm -- especially when people initially fail to understand his work.\"You still get those conversations you overhear of people saying 'they shouldn't pollute the water like that painting on it',\" he says. \"It's always funny to hear those stories.\"The whole project is dream come true stuff as I said. Don't tell Larry and the others but I expect we all would have done it for free!\"I remember when we did it thinking, this is going to make a huge difference for sailing and the audience, especially the Americans. Now a lot more people understand sailing.\"Helicopters scour the seas during this year's Chellenger Playoffs.Honey's successor Sheffield is continuing to innovate.He and his team are housed in a temporary container on race day, with Sheffield admitting \"the hairs on the back of my neck go up when I enter that container.\"\"Of course, we sometimes have crazy ideas and there's a bucket list of things I want to do,\" he adds. \"We just have to wait and see if that's possible.\"For this year's America's Cup match, thermal imaging cameras on the sailors will be one of the new innovations.For Sheffield, who describes the job as \"perpetual plate spinning,\" it is all about \"trying for perfection, and there's no reason not to try to be better.\"Like Honey, Sheffield comes from an engineering and sailing background having competed in the America's Cup previously.\"The way the technology has changed in the America's Cup reflects the way the world has changed, with its high pace,\" he says.Visit cnn.com/sailing for more news and videos\"We're all dialed into 11 now and people want that excitement, to be on the edge.

The British Brexit minister, David Davis, will open the talks with the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, supported by officials on both sides. It will be a typically Brussels affair: an opening session, a 90-minute working lunch for the two lead negotiators to set the scene, then the dry, detailed business of working groups with officials poring over documents.Agenda for the 1st formal negotiating round. Negotiations in Brussels ending with press conference @MichelBarnier & @DavidDavisMP #Brexit pic.twitter.com/1Z8WLKMtSi\u2014 European Commission (@EU_Commission) June 16, 2017\nThe bureaucratic, orderly nature of the negotiations belies the chaos and confusion that have dominated the Brexit debate in the UK over the past year. And since the election results last week that left Prime Minister Theresa May without a parliamentary majority, that chaos and confusion have intensified.EU officials in Brussels are ready to negotiate -- the sense of impatience is palpable. But there is also incredulity that the British government is preparing to go into the talks with a hard-line negotiating position when it cannot command a majority at home.Read MoreIn calling the election back in April, the Prime Minister asked the electorate to give her a mandate for a hard Brexit, based on Britain leaving the European single market and making a clean break with the EU. After voters rejected that request, the Brexit talks start Monday lacking clarity on what the exact nature of the UK's departure from Europe will be.Brexit jobs trackerThat problem is compounded by the fact that May has yet to strike a deal with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party that would give her the extra votes in Parliament she needs for a working majority. The Democratic Unionist Party wants to attach its own conditions onto Brexit as part of its deal with the Conservatives -- including the insistence on a \"soft border\" between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.JUST WATCHEDIrish farmers straddling border fear BrexitReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHIrish farmers straddling border fear Brexit 03:25But given May will have a limited majority in the House of Commons, even with the backing of the Northern Irish party, opposition parties such as Labour and the Liberal Democrats have their own agendas to pursue and will seek to amend any law that comes before Parliament connected to Britain's withdrawal from Europe.Put together, May's case for a hard Brexit is extraordinarily weak -- something that negotiators in Brussels will see coming before Davis and his team have a chance to step off the Eurostar train.Of course, the government is not only beleaguered by its post-election hiatus but by the growing anger over its response to this week's Grenfell Tower fire disaster -- with May criticized for failing to meet victims' families and politicians facing anger in the streets from local residents. The nature of the tragedy has highlighted the inequality in pockets of London and elsewhere in the UK, including the housing conditions of disadvantaged communities. It begs the question whether May's government, apparently rudderless and without real power, can realistically hope for getting a deal out of Europe when its own social problems seem to have reached a boiling point at home.Monday will just be the first day of what will be more than 18 months of talks.      The tightly managed timetable, known in EU parlance as sequencing, means that negotiators will start discussing the \"divorce settlement\" -- how much the UK will have to pay to exit the bloc -- before it turns to talks on which ties the country will keep with Europe, if any. This first phase could take many weeks. But public trust in the government is faltering, and May's own poll ratings have plummeted since Election Day. Two months ago, the Prime Minister could have looked forward to Britain having a strong negotiating hand on Day One of Brexit talks; now it is hard to see how her position could be any weaker.",

Although Vonn is one of America's best-known female athletes, ski racing is a small sport.With the Winter Olympics taking place in February 2018 in Pyeonchang, South Korea, what better time to stage a \"Battle of the Sexes\" style ski race reminiscent to the match between King and Riggs that attracted a television audience of 90 million viewers worldwide and helped put women's tennis on the map? King's victory over Riggs at the Houston Astrodome in 1973 was watched by more than 30,000 spectactors and over 90 million on television worldwide. \"Every Olympic cycle there is definitely more excitement about ski racing,\" said Vonn, who in the past has been in touch with King about staging a ski race against the men.\"And this is a time when we need to capitalize our viewership and hopefully keep more fans tuning in and watching and continue to try to get ski racing on television in the US as well, outside of the Olympics.\"In 2015, King told CNN that four decades on from her landmark match against Riggs, attitudes in tennis sometimes appeared to have barely moved an inch.\"When I played Bobby Riggs, do you realize that [former commentator] Howard Cosell talked about my looks the whole time?\"And they're still doing the same thing. They still talk about their looks.\"Vonn says the reaction from the male ski racing community has been largely positive to her idea.Stumbling blocksIn order to measure herself against her male competitors, Vonn will have to get over a few stumbling blocks. In 2012, the International Ski Federation (FIS) turned down her request to race her male competitors in Lake Louise, saying \"one gender is not entitled to participate in races of the other\" with no exceptions made. Two weeks ago, women's chief race director Atle Skaardal called the issue \"a very difficult topic\" in a statement on the FIS website following the governing body's spring meetings.Vonn racing at Lake Louise in 2012Although he didn't reject the idea outright, and said he was waiting for the US Ski Association to come up with a concrete proposal, Skaardal said it would be \"a very difficult challenge to find a reasonable way of doing this.\" \"Because one point that everyone is underestimating, is that we need to have equal rights for everyone,\" said Skaardal, a former ski racer from Norway.\"So if the ladies are allowed to race with the men, then also the men need to be authorized to ski with the ladies.

        "content": "London (CNN)British Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday announced a full public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower disaster as grief turned to anger a day after the blaze that left at least 17 dead.Speaking after visiting the site of the devastating fire in London's North Kensington area, May said she wanted to make sure \"this terrible tragedy is properly investigated.\"London's fire chief said there's little chance of finding any others alive in the charred remains of the tower. Dozens remain missing.The Metropolitan Police have preliminarily identified six victims of the fire, Cmdr. Stuart Cundy said. He added that six bodies were recovered outside but they are not necessarily the victims who were identified.Eleven bodies that have been spotted inside have not been recovered.Read MoreInvestigators expect the death toll to rise, he said. May's government was facing growing questions about why ministers did not act on recommendations following an earlier fire in London, which led to calls for sprinkler systems to be installed in residential blocks and for a full review of Britain's fire regulations.David Lammy, a member of Parliament from the opposition Labour Party, said charges should be brought against those held responsible for the tragedy.Latest developments-- The final death toll is unknown; there's no number on the missing.-- Residents who escaped were offered housing overnight.-- The local council says it has enough donations for the survivors.-- Thirty-seven are people in the hospital; 17 of them are critical.-- The Prime Minister visited the site Thursday.Fire still burns inside one of the flats in the Grenfell Tower. Firefighters were still working to dampen the blaze and search for remains of the dead Thursday.London Fire Commissioner Dany Cotton said she had \"genuinely\" no idea about how many people were still missing. She admitted it would be an \"absolute miracle\" if anyone else were still alive in the tower and that it would take weeks to complete a proper search.Cotton said that urban search and rescue dogs would be deployed inside the building. While the core of the building was structurally sound, dogs were lighter and more agile than people, she said. Her staff will remain on the scene for days, and the search of the tower would be a \"slow and painstaking process.\"The blaze gutted rooms inside the high-rise building. Cotton also said that parts of the building would have to be shored up to make it safe for rescue workers to reach each floor.May praised the actions of the emergency services and the local community in coming together at such a difficult time.She also sought to reassure residents who lost their homes that they would be rehoused in London and as close as possible to that area.\"We need to know what happened, we need to know an explanation,\" she said. \"We owe that to the families, to the people who have lost loved ones and the homes in which they lived.\"The rescue mission has turned into a search-and-recovery operaton. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said in an earlier call for a public inquiry that an interim report should be produced by the summer.\"We can't afford to wait many years for these answers,\" he said during a Thursday evening news conference that became testy as local residents surrounded him, at times shouting expletives. British  Prime Minister Theresa May speaks to firefighters Thursday as she visits Grenfell Tower.AngerLammy, the Labour lawmaker from London, called for arrests, describing the fire as \"corporate manslaughter.\" Lammy told the BBC he had yet to hear from family friend Khadjia Saye, who lived in the tower. He called the fire \"an outrage.\"Grentfell Tower - It is totally unacceptable for this to happen in Britain in 2017, particularly in our richest borough. #r4today\u2014 David Lammy (@DavidLammy) June 15, 2017\n\"We built buildings in the '70s. Those '70s buildings, many of them should be demolished. They haven't got easy fire escapes. They've got no sprinklers,\" Lammy told the BBC. \"It's totally, totally unacceptable in Britain that this is allowed to happen and people lose their lives in this way, and people should be held to account.\"Questions remain over how the fire began and how it spread so quickly through the tower that was home to as many as 500 people. Originally constructed in 1974, the residential tower block recently underwent a $13.2 million (\u00a310.3 million) refurbishment carried out by private developers Rydon and completed last summer. The focus has turned to questions over the exterior cladding added as part of the refurbishment.May consults with London Fire Commissioner Dany Cotton, left, at the scene of the fire Thursday.Many survivors said the fire spread quickly with little warning. Multiple residents told CNN they did not hear fire alarms when the blaze broke out.Residents had complained about safety for several years.In November, the Grenfell Action Group highlighted ongoing concerns among residents over the safety of the tower, managed by the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation on behalf of the borough.     The group's blog post argued that only \"a catastrophic event will expose the ineptitude and incompetence of our landlord ... and bring an end to the dangerous living conditions and neglect of health and safety legislation that they inflict upon their tenants and leaseholders.\"The management company acknowledged residents' concerns in a statement: \"It is too early to speculate what caused the fire and contributed to its spread. We will cooperate fully with all the relevant authorities in order to ascertain the cause of this tragedy. ... We are aware that concerns have been raised historically by residents. We always take all concerns seriously and these will form part of our forthcoming investigations.\" Photos: Fire engulfs West London apartment blockBurning debris falls from Grenfell Tower as a massive fire engulfs the London apartment building early on June 14, 2017.

Ian Burgess, a professor of structural engineering at the University of Sheffield, told CNN that while fires do spread vertically up buildings, it's \"generally quite a slow process.\" \"This was clearly a very rapid transmission of flame up the front of the building,\" he said. JUST WATCHEDShock over how quickly flames engulfed buildingReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHShock over how quickly flames engulfed building 02:42Mike Gilmartin, director of Omega Fire Engineering, said that to meet requirements, a building must have residential sprinklers and fire alarms in every apartment as well as other features such as a firefighting shaft. Gilmartin said fire design has evolved over the years but it's not feasible to make all older buildings comply with the latest legislation. He added it's standard guidance that residents should stay in their apartments if a fire breaks out, as many of those in Grenfell Tower did. A 2009 fire at a residential block in south London, Lakanal House, led to calls for sprinkler systems to be installed in similar buildings. The government repeatedly committed itself to reviewing fire standards in buildings but to date has not done so. Community comes togetherAs the smoke continued to billow from the tower, locals worked hard Thursday to help those left homeless.Messages of hope written on a poster near Grenfell Tower. The local council received so many donations of food and supplies that by Thursday morning it said it did not need any more.Piles of baby carriages, luggage, food supplies, toys and furniture could be seen stacked on the streets as mourners and well-wishers wrote messages of solidarity and hope on posters near the ruined tower.Thanks for the donations of clothes, food etc.  Our partners have been inundated with generous offers and have no more space at present.\u2014 RBKC (@RBKC) June 15, 2017\nDozens of hotel rooms, apartments and other rooms were donated to house the survivors.

At the height of the blaze, around 200 firefighters, 40 fire trucks and 20 ambulance crews were at the scene.\"This is going to be a long and complex recovery operation and I do anticipate that the number of fatalities will sadly increase beyond those 12,\" London Metropolitan Police Commander Stuart Cundy said Wednesday night. \"I don't anticipate there will be further survivors.\"After London fire, desperate pleas for missing residents on social media It is unclear how many people are still unaccounted for. The Italian Foreign Ministry said at least two Italians are missing and British Labour politician David Lammy said artist Khadija Saye also was missing.By the afternoon, emergency centers had been set up at nearby churches and posts. Community members and organizations handed out food, clothes and other supplies to those left with no home to return to. Some in the community suggested the Muslim holy month of Ramadan helped contain the fallout. The neighborhood is home to a large number of Muslims who were awake when the fire broke for their early morning meal before starting their daily fast.\"A lot of lives were saved because of that, because they were awake,\" said neighborhood resident Ahmed Shellat, who claimed to know people in the building. \"They felt the fire quickly, and they saw the heat so they just ran out. If it was like a normal day they would've been asleep and there would have caused a lot of casualties.\"As night fell Wednesday, Londoners gathered near the building to participate in a candlelight vigil and contribute to relief efforts.

While the borough is one of the most affluent in London, North Kensington is a particularly deprived district.The tower was built in the 1970s and recently subject to a $10.9 million redevelopment, according to property firm Rydon. The building was to undergo specific improvements to fire safety and ventilation works. The web page detailing the refurbishment was unavailable for a time on Wednesday.Local councilor Robert Atkinson told CNN the renovation works had modernized kitchens and new heating systems. Safety certificates had been issued and the council had been \"told it had all been brought up to date,\" he said.Fire chiefs said it was too early to speculate on the cause of the blaze. Residents of the tower had expressed concerns over the safety of the building, specifically pointing to fire risks, according to a website run by the \"Grenfell Action Group.\"     Rydon, the company that undertook a refurbishment of Grenfell Tower, says its work met \"all required building control, fire regulation and health and safety standards.\"The company that manages the building, Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, said it was focusing on helping residents while London Fire Brigade investigates the safety of the tower's structure.The company that installed the cladding on the exterior of the structure is \"not aware of any link between the fire and the exterior cladding to the tower,\" their managing director said in a statement Wednesday. Cladding is a covering or coating on a structure.The company, Harley Facades Limited, said it did not manufacture the cladding, and added: \"The Aluminium Composite Material (ACM) panels are a commonly used product in the refurbishment industry.\"\"We will fully support and cooperate with the investigations into this fire,\" Managing Director Ray Bailey said. London Mayor Sadiq Khan visited the site on Wednesday afternoon with fire officials. He said authorities would address residents' concerns as questions begin to swirl on how the blaze started and ripped up the building so quickly. He added that the British government has promised inspections of other apartment buildings with similar refurbishments.\"It's really important that their questions are answered. I'll be demanding answers,\" he told reporters.Leaping from windowsAccording to witness accounts, some residents were told to stay inside their apartments as the fire raged. High-rise buildings are typically designed to contain fire outbreaks within floors, so it is often safer to stay in an apartment unaffected by a blaze. But this fire seemed to tear up the building from the outside, gutting the outer apartments and blackening most of the facade.JUST WATCHEDAsif: People were jumping out of windowsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAsif: People were jumping out of windows 01:27One woman said her friend was inside for three hours and was told by police to wait and put towels down to block the doors.

A local residents' group had repeatedly expressed concerns about fire safety, going back several years.The company that manages the tower on behalf of the local authority had placed fire safety policy across all of its housing stock under review.Questions were raised about a recent refurbishment, which had included a replacement of the cladding on the outside of the building, although the principal contractor said all building and safety regulations had been met.Originally constructed in 1974, the residential tower block had recently undergone a massive $13.2M (\u00a310.3M) refurbishment carried out by private developers Rydon and completed in the summer of 2016.According to the local authority's website, these large-scale works included the installation of \"insulated exterior cladding, new double-glazed windows and a new communal heating system, with the goal of improving energy efficiency.\"Read MoreNotably, redevelopment of the building included provisions for improvements to the \"smoke/fire safety and ventilation works.\"      Warnings of 'catastrophe'However, in a blog post dated November 20, 2016, a residents group, the Grenfell Action Group (GAC), highlighted ongoing concerns among residents over the safety of the building, managed by the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organization (KCTMO) on behalf of the borough.The blog post, published after completion of the refurbishment work, argued that only \"a catastrophic event will expose the ineptitude and incompetence of our landlord ... and bring an end to the dangerous living conditions and neglect of health and safety legislation that they inflict upon their tenants and leaseholders.\"The post was the latest in a series that dated back to 2013. \"We have blogged many times on the subject of fire safety at Grenfell Tower and we believe that these investigations will become part of damning evidence of the poor safety record of the KCTMO,\" the post read.In a statement on Wednesday, the management company acknowledged residents' concerns. \"It is too early to speculate what caused the fire and contributed to its spread. We will cooperate fully with all the relevant authorities in order to ascertain the cause of this tragedy.\"\"We are aware that concerns have been raised historically by residents. We always take all concerns seriously and these will form part of our forthcoming investigations.\"  Photos: Fire engulfs West London apartment blockBurning debris falls from Grenfell Tower as a massive fire engulfs the London apartment building early on June 14, 2017.

Terry O'Neil, former head of fire engineering at the London Fire Brigade, told CNN that the fire in the building appears to have \"spread rapidly from the outside of the building\", which was \"very unusual.\"Christopher J P Miers, an architect and founder of the construction dispute resolution group Probyn Miers, said it was \"very concerning\" that the fire was able spread so quickly through the building's fa\u00e7ade. Online records show that the company responsible for cladding the building's exterior, Harley Facades Limited, installed \"over-cladding with ACM cassette rainscreen.\"  Miers suggested that the investigation would focus on the ACM (aluminum composite material) panels, what's behind them, and whether the entire exterior wall was constructed to the standards required by the building code.     Mike Gilmartin, director of Omega Fire Engineering Limited, said that investigators would concentrate on how the fire spread so fast. \"The question has to be asked how was it able to do so and within a short period of time,\" he said.\"Of a building of that height we would expect the insulation in the external wall build-up to be of 'limited combustibility'. While it may not have been present in the original construction, consideration should have been given to installing this in the recent refurb.\"'Not appropriate to speculate'Ray Bailey, Managing Director at Harley Facades Limited, said the company would cooperate with the investigation. \"There will be many questions about this whole incident and so you will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for us to comment or for others to speculate on any aspect of fire or it causes in advance of these inquiries.   At this time, we are not aware of any link between the fire and the exterior cladding to the tower.\"Smoke continues to rise from the 24-story residential Grenfell Tower in west London Wednesday afternoon.Rydon, the main contractor, said the refurbishment work met \"all required building control, fire regulation and health and safety standards.\"The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea issued a statement early Wednesday saying that its main focus was the rescue operation. \"The cause of the fire will be fully investigated and we will keep people informed,\" it said.Questions over safety recordResidents' concerns appeared to be focused on the management company's fire safety record.In October 2015 a fire ripped through another KCTMO property, the nearby 14-story Adair Tower in North Kensington, a \"serious incident\" according to official reports \"which resulted in 16 residents requiring hospital treatment for the effects of smoke inhalation.\"After the Adair Tower fire, KCTMO had been issued with two enforcement notices to install \"self-closing devices on all flat entrance doors\" and review communal staircases and ventilation in the lift lobbies to ensure staircases are \"available for use by residents and attending fire crews.\" According to minutes of a KCTMO board meeting in November 2016, works to address the issues raised in the enforcement notices had been completed.The minutes also show that the management company put its fire policy and strategy under review across all of its housing stock. It raised the need for a \"more proactive approach\" to fitting self-closing doors, to increase the frequency of fire risk assessments, and to address the issue of \"hoarders\" -- residents who accumulate materials in their apartments.The building continued to smolder late in the day.Located between the wealthy neighborhood of Notting Hill and the White City social housing estate, Grenfell Tower was home to 125 families, according to local councilor Robert Atkinson. Many were council tenants -- residents whose housing is subsided by the local government. All of the building's 120 apartment units were occupied throughout the refurbishment process, according to the borough website.Dany Cotton, Commissioner of the London Fire Brigade, told reporters that it was an \"unprecedented\" event in her 29 years of service.As you will appreciate, this is a completely unprecedented fire. In my 29 years in the London Fire Brigade, I have never seen a fire of this nature, and I have seen many high-rise fires.\"\"This will of course be subject to a major investigation, but at this moment in time we do not wish to speculate further about the cause of the fire, or the fire's spread. That is something that will be closely looked at in the very near future.\"",

Andrea Leadsom, leader of the House of Commons, announced the date change on Thursday. \"The Government has agreed with Buckingham Palace that the State Opening of Parliament will take place on 21 June 2017,\" Leadsom said in a statement, according to the UK Press Association. The Queen's Speech had been scheduled for June 19, but there has been speculation among British media outlets for days that a delay appeared to be in the works following the Conservative Party's lackluster election performance. The announcement comes as British Prime Minister Theresa May continues to court the Democratic Unionist Party in a bid to secure an alliance to remain in power.Read MoreThe announcement of a DUP-Conservative deal was expected to come earlier this week but is believed to have been postponed after the fatal high-rise fire in West London on Wednesday. Earlier this week, DUP leader Arlene Foster met with the British Prime Minister to discuss a potential partnership.\"Discussions are going well with the government and we hope soon to be able to bring this work to a successful conclusion,\" Foster wrote on Twitter after the meeting.Foster had previously said an alliance between the DUP and Conservative Party would help defend Northern Ireland's position as the UK prepares to begin Brexit negotiations.\"The next few weeks represent a real opportunity for everyone in Northern Ireland to heed the will of the people and capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead for everyone,\" Foster wrote in a Belfast Telegraph article on Monday. On Thursday, the UK government issued a joint statement confirming Brexit talks would begin on Monday.It read: \"David Davis, Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, and Michel Barnier, the European Commission's Chief Negotiator, agreed today to launch Article 50 negotiations on Monday, 19 June.\"",

The now famed fescue grass has had a rough time of it from some of the players this week -- US golfer Kevin Na's Instagram video vividly revealed the difficultly of finding a ball, let alone trying to hack one back onto the fairway. Not everyone is complaining though. Rory McIlroy noted that the fairways at Erin Hills are generously wide compared to the traditional set up at US Open venues. \"I get that it's thick and whatever, but it's a hazard,\" McIlory said, Tuesday.\"It's a US Open, it's supposed to be a tough test. And if guys can't put it into play within a 50-yard zone I don't think they've got much to complain about.\"The US Golf Association have since trimmed the rough on selected holes saying the wet weather forecast has forced their hand -- not the players.Rahm, meanwhile, has chosen to steer clear of the rough during practice rounds. \"I didn't step in it,\" Rahm said in a pre-tournament press conference. \"There's no need to injure my wrist this week before I tee off. \"It really looks very penalizing. Unless you get extremely lucky where you might be able to move it 120 yards, it looks like a 30-yard chip out to the fairway.\"JUST WATCHEDDustin Johnson: Fed up with just being goodReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHDustin Johnson: Fed up with just being good 03:25READ: Phil Mickelson to skip US Open for kid's graduationIt's a measure of Rahm's new-found status that he is mentioned alongside the likes of reigning US Open champion Dustin Johnson, and former winners Jordan Spieth and McIlroy as a genuine contender.Victory for Rahm would further boost Spanish golf after Sergio Garcia's emotional win at the Masters in April on what would have been Seve Ballesteros' 60th birthday. \"If in my lifetime if I can show and express half of what Seve did for the game of golf it will be a very accomplished career,\" Rahm said.It's a bit early to start talking about Rahm in the same breath as Ballesteros but time and natural talent are on his side and so, it seems, is his temperament.  \"It's been quite a journey,\" he said. \"I feel nothing but excitement and accomplishment but I'm a little bit scared because I'm don't know how I'm going to follow next year after this year. \"But there's a long way to go ... I'm sure I'll be just fine.\"",

The August 26 rumble in Las Vegas between Mayweather -- boxing's top-ever earner coming out of retirement with a 49-0 record -- and UFC lightweight champion Conor McGregor, will likely be the biggest payday in the history of the sport.Follow @cnnsport\n\n\"Bring him over to the boxing world and I'll show him what it's like, easy\" Mayweather -- who has reportedly grossed $700 million in his career -- told reporters in January, when speculation first brewed about the matchup. Forty-year-old Mayweather, who last fought in September 2015 against Andre Berto, will give up an inch in height and two inches of reach to 28-year-old McGregor. Read MoreMcGregor began as a youth boxer in his native city of Dublin, but has never boxed professionally. The left-hander is known for his aggressive style and counterpunching, earning 18 of his 21 mixed martial arts wins by knockout.     THE FIGHT IS ON. A post shared by Conor McGregor Official (@thenotoriousmma) on Jun 14, 2017 at 2:21pm PDT\n\"People always think it's a game or it's an act,\" McGregor -- a 6/1 underdog according to bookmakers' opening lines -- said. \"I'm just simply the best fighter, that's it.\"His three career losses -- including a March, 2016 fall to Nate Diaz -- have all come by way of submission. (He avenged the Diaz loss with a decision victory five months later.)McGregor announced his signing on Wednesday with an Instagram post appearing to poke fun of Mayweather, showing a split photo of himself and Floyd Mayweather Sr. Although Mayweather's father, a former boxer and top trainer, returned to his son's camp of late, the two were estranged for many years. Mayweather Sr. trained the likes of Oscar De La Hoya and Ricky Hatton instead. It is not clear whether father and son will be reunited for another bout. Biggest purse in boxing history?Given the two-year build-up of social media sparring between the flashy opponents, the heavyweight purse at stake in this super welterweight bout was simply too much to resist. \"When you're talking about $500 million projections in terms of financials, it's the fight that had to happen within the sports industry,\" Scott Hurst, MMA expert and co-founder of the website Real Sport, told CNN's World Sport show.   A post shared by Floyd Mayweather (@floydmayweather) on Jun 14, 2017 at 2:30pm PDT\nNumbers have yet to be confirmed, but Mayweather has previously stated he would take no less than $100 million guaranteed, and offered $15 million to McGregor. In his previous mega-bout, a 2015 contest against Manny Pacquiao, Mayweather grossed a record $500 million, according to the two camps and the TV networks involved.In January, McGregor boldly claimed a fight between him and Mayweather would make $1 billion.\"One thing we can get excited for is that we've got Mayweather and McGregor, two of the best trash talkers in the world,\" Hurst adds. \"I believe the run-up to the fight and the build-up is going to be 100 times better than the fight itself.\" The lack of cohesion between the two sports appears to be a disadvantage for Irishman McGregor, who will be fighting on his opponent's terms. It's not quite Jessie Owens racing against horse -- a contest which Owens won, incidentally -- or Muhammed Ali farcically fighting Japanese wrestler Antonio Inoki in a 1976 exhibition, but it's an odd pairing nonetheless. Heavyweight boxer Muhammad Ali fought the champion Japanese wrestler Antonio Inoki at Budokan Hall in Tokyo, on 26th June 1976.  \"If you're running a marathon, then the marathon runner is going to win against a sprinter 99.9% of the time,\" says Hurst. \"Unless Mayweather falls out of the ring, or doesn't turn up for the fight, I think it's very unlikely that the 49-0, undefeated, pound-for-pound best boxer is going to lose to McGregor with no boxing experience whatsoever.\" \"He will last as long as Mayweather will allow him to last for,\" legendary boxing trainer Teddy Atlas told ESPN. \"All these UFC guys, they are very tough, tough guys. They have grappling skills and (if) they get you on the floor, you know, for the average athlete it's all over,\" he added. \"But as far as strictly adhering to boxing rules? No contest baby.\"\"They are cavemen, they would not beat C-level fighters.\"JUST WATCHEDThe MMA owner who wouldn't sign Conor McGregorReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe MMA owner who wouldn't sign Conor McGregor 04:37READ: The fight club where Conor McGregor isn't welcomeREAD: Take a guided tour of UFC's new headquartersOne point that is getting little attention so far is that Mayweather is coming out of retirement at risk to his undefeated 49-0 record, an unblemished mark which currently ties former heavyweight champion Rocky Marciano.\"That's the easiest road to a 50th win in the history of the sport,\" says Hurst.

But, for many, the fight for equality is ongoing, which is why a group of women are to climb Mount Kilimanjaro and attempt to break the world record for the highest game of competitive football played. Follow @cnnsport\n\nOver the course of seven to 10 days, the women will scale nearly 6,000 meters (19,330 feet) of Africa's highest mountain. After reaching the summit, they will descend to 18,799 feet and play a 90-minute, 11-a-side match on a volcanic ash pitch at an altitude not attempted before. The footballers, representing 20 nationalities, include retired US international Lori Lindsey,  former England midfielder Rachel Unitt, ex-Germany international Petra Landers and former Mexico captain Monica Gonzalez.

Lindsey said she had not undertaken any special training for the task ahead, but the challenge will be far from easy. Playing in thin air causes a reduction in physical performance and in May 2007, FIFA -- football's world governing body -- introduced a temporary ban, revoked a year later, on international matches at more than 8,200ft above sea level, citing concerns about players' health and the \"unfair\" advantage to acclimatized home teams. Earlier in 2007, Brazilian club Flamengo had said it would boycott high-altitude games after a match at 12,467 ft (3,800m) against Bolivia's Real Potosi left some team members needing oxygen.Fresh snow covered Mount Kilimanjaro seen at sunrise from Ambuseli game reserve in Kenya'Men aren't climbing for equality'Through the organization Equal Playing Field, and various crowd funding pages, the women have been raising money for the mission which must accommodate players, FIFA referees, coaches, a medical team and support crew. Lindsey -- who is aiming to raise $9,000 on her GoFundMe page -- said the fact that fundraising was necessary highlighted the disparity between men and women. \"Men, in general, aren't raising money for equality,\" said the 37-year-old, who made 31 appearances for her national team. \"Men aren't climbing for equality. They have it.\" Lori Lindsey is challenged by Catalina Usme of Colombia during the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup In April, the US women's national soccer team ended a long-running dispute over pay and conditions by agreeing a new deal with US Soccer, the country's governing body. The world champions had long claimed the men's national team unjustly earned more and five high-profile players -- Carli Lloyd, Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe, Becky Sauerbrunn and Hope Solo -- filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in March alleging wage discrimination. That is not the only case this year of international sportswomen taking a stand.Also in April, the Republic of Ireland women's football team threatened to go on strike. Players' representative, Stuart Gilhooly, said they were being treated like \"fifth-class citizens\" by the Football Association of Ireland. And it is not only in football that the debate over equality is ongoing. US women's hockey threatened to boycott the world championships before agreeing a pay deal just three days before the start of the tournament, while a tennis tournament director was forced to resign in March after saying female players \"ride on the coattails of the men.\"READ: Sweden's women wear motivational messagesJUST WATCHEDUS star Carli Lloyd reflects on City adventureReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHUS star Carli Lloyd reflects on City adventure 03:21Helping around the worldEqual Playing Field had said it wanted to \"challenge the social norms for girls and women in sport\" and acknowledge \"the systematic, structured inequality that girls and women face in most aspects of their lives.\"Laura Youngson, Equal Playing Field's co-founder, said: \"We want to break a record to inspire other women and girls to keep challenging the inequalities in sport.\"Sport brings friendships and community, commitment and leadership, and strength and health.

From June 30 through to November, they will pass on their knowledge to girls in South Africa, Argentina, Zambia, Mexico, Dubai, Beijing and the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan. \"Inequality, whether directly or not, affects me every single day,\" said Lindsey. \"We're making headway in the States and, for us, our next step is to make a major impact in other parts of the world that need support and help in progressing women's football. \"You look at Thailand at the 2015 World Cup, they were wearing hand-me-downs from the men's teams. \"There's a discussion around whether or not we should expand the Women's World Cup from 16 teams to 24.\"Some people say getting beat 10-0 doesn't help women's soccer, that it makes it look bad.

Her family lives on the 22nd floor. When the fire broke out shortly before 1 a.m., she was at her friend Suzanne's house, breaking her Ramadan fast with a pre-dawn meal. She had stopped by after work. Her three young children stayed behind, and she had not heard from any of them since. Read More\"The only reason that Susan wasn't in that tower is that she was eating with our family for Ramadan,\" Suzanne explained.\"If she had not been with us she would have been in the tower ... I don't want to think about it. Now, we wait to hear ... and we pray.\"Suzanne spent the night attempting to find her friend's family.Susan and Suzanne -- who both declined to give their last names to CNN -- spent the early hours of Wednesday visiting hospitals and shelter for signs of hope. Susan's phone would not stop ringing, nor did the phones of her friends. All of this happened as the air filled thick with smoke, the smell of burning plastic floating through an eerily quiet London street.\"The residents said this would happen, and the council did nothing,\" Suzanne said. \"The tower had been refurbished but people were unhappy. They said it wasn't safe.\"Read: What we know so far'People are scared'While Susan cried, children on a nearby balcony laughed and joked while playing with a ball. A cyclist stopped to take a photo of the scene before peddling off on his way again. As adults gathered together in the street, children laughed and played.As the sun fought its way through the thick gray plume, locals who had spent the night in the streets began to spring into action. Carrying bags of food and water, they trod through the vast black debris which spread as far as the eye could see.Local shopkeepers wheeled shopping carts full of supplies towards pop-up donation centers, stopping along the way to hand out fruit and water to police and firefighters battling the blaze, which has left at least 12 people dead. Many of the tower's residents spent the night at a nearby community center.Outside the Harrow Club, one of the centers offering shelter to residents of the tower, volunteers rushed to help.Jade, a local resident who declined to give CNN her last name, had been there all morning, helping those who ran for their lives as flames engulfed the high-rise and pieces of the building fell from the sky.Residents, weary and still in their night clothes, began to emerge as further refuges were set up around the local area to help with the increasing flow of people.Aisha Hailstones and her daughter Santana brought supplies to the local community center.\"I've been with the firefighters, giving them water,\" Jade says. \"They told me they've never seen anything like it. They're in tears.\"\"The people are scared. They've nowhere to go. Everyone is trying to help. This is a really tight community, a real melting pot. We stick together. We do it because it's what you do.\"Jade is heartbroken for the victims, but she's also visibly angry -- and she is not alone.  'We don't know when we can go home'The borough of Kensington is one of London's most affluent areas, a playground for the rich and famous that includes the wealthy neighborhoods of Notting Hill and Chelsea.And yet parts of the borough are extremely disadvantaged. On some streets, multi-million pound properties sit opposite run-down government housing complexes, making the margin between wealthy and poor all too visible.Friends and neighbors consoled one another throughout the day.\"This is one of the richest boroughs in London, so why aren't they doing more to help people?\" asked Jade, who declined to give her surname to CNN. \"They have the money but the rich people only care about themselves, they don't care about us.\"These people have lost everything and they're relying on people like us to come out and help them. But where are the people who are supposed to be in charge? Have you seen them come down here?\"There's no way children should be living in these buildings. The council has money it could spend on helping these families but it hasn't happened.\"Bitte and Harry were evacuated from their home at 2.30 a.m.Bitte and Harry, who live in a housing estate across the street from Grenfell Tower, were awoken at 2:30 a.m. by police knocking on their door and evacuated over fears that the debris could set fire to their building.The couple spent the rest of the night in the communal garden watching the tower burn while their Muslim neighbors served them tea and sandwiches. And while the generosity and camaraderie of the neighborhood has inspired them, Bitte says the lack of information given to residents by authorities has been \"appalling.\"\"There has been nobody here to tell us anything,\" she said. \"We don't know when we can go home. There were lots of people with nowhere to go.\"Debris from the tower was strewn across the local area.Harry heard people with children screaming for help. \"They were waving towels. I saw one person jump. There was so much screaming,\" he said.He recalled how some of pieces falling from the building looked like plastic cladding. \"It's cheap, that's why they use it,\" he said. \"They don't care about people like us. You wouldn't get away with cladding like that in Germany or Scandinavia but here, they don't have that problem.\"Read: Witnesses say 'no warning' was given'Heartbreaking'Harry, like many other locals CNN spoke to, said residents had complained about safety going back several years.In November a residents group, the Grenfell Action Group (GAC), highlighted ongoing concerns among residents over the safety of the tower, managed by the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organization (KCTMO) on behalf of the borough.Masks were given out to local residents to help with the noxious fumes.The blog post argued that only \"a catastrophic event will expose the ineptitude and incompetence of our landlord ... and bring an end to the dangerous living conditions and neglect of health and safety legislation that they inflict upon their tenants and leaseholders.\"Robert Black, Chief Executive of KCTMO, said in a statement that the loss of life at Grenfell Tower was \"heartbreaking\" and that staff were supporting residents. \"We will issue a further statement in due course,\" he said. The statement did not address the residents' allegations.Read: Londoners open doors to victims of apartment fire'Nobody listens to us'The burnt cladding was strewn across a number of streets surrounding the tower.Young children, many of whom wore face masks to keep out the toxic fumes, stopped and stared at the enormous black objects littering the roads.Five-year-old Thea West escaped from Grenfell Tower with her family.Outside the Latymer Christian Center, volunteers directed members of the public who were dropping off donations, locals handed out snacks to children, and commuters stopped to take photos before continuing with their day.Cyclists collected lattes from a nearby cafe, school kids laughed as they headed to school, others walked towards the gym with their lives perhaps untouched by the tragedy unfolding nearby.A couple of streets over, Jean Haley stood with a broom, quietly brushing away the debris which had fallen into her front garden.\"Well, you've just got to get on with it,\" she said. The 80-year-old has lived in the area for the past 50 years, 25 of which she spent at another tower block close by.Read: Why did tower block go up in flames?Haley's niece was inside Grenfall Tower when the fire began. She managed to escape to safety from her third floor apartment.Haley had watched from her window as the tower became surrounded by the raging inferno, her hands shaking as the chaos unfolded.Haley spent the morning sweeping debris away from the communal gardens.\"Nobody listens to us,\" she said, shaking her head as she swept her yard. \"This is all council housing but I've been asking for five years for someone to sort out my broken doors.\"\"I've got a crack den opposite and they hide the drugs in my temporary doors. I've told the council but they don't listen.\"No, they just let us get on with it. The whole area is shoddy now. They're supposed to be regenerating it, but just look around.\"What has happened is awful,\" Haley added. \"I hope they'll listen now.\"",

It was the site of a terror attack on June 3 that killed eight people. \"We wanted to just celebrate unity at a time when our society was so divided from the attacks last week,\" volunteer Laila Rob said.\"We just felt really disheartened by what had happened,\" Rob told CNN.The volunteers hugged passersby and cried with them as they shared stories with one another. What they discovered was that people enjoyed receiving the flowers -- but they enjoyed the conversations even more.Read More\"It was more about the idea behind the rose than just giving out the rose,\" Rob said. \"That's what we want to create: just an open platform for that dialogue.\"A group of more than a dozen volunteers handed out 3,000 roses near the London Bridge.Most of the volunteers are British Muslims, and some of the conversations centered on racial commonalities. Rob said it made her happy to see that emotion from strangers.The idea to pass out the roses came from Zakia Bassou, 27, after talking with a florist from Zara Flora Flowers in East Grinstead, West Sussex. Bassou and some friends started a crowdfunding group with an initial target of \u00a3600 ($765). They ended up raising more than \u00a32,500, as of Tuesday afternoon. Their goal was, \"to raise money for 1000 roses which we'll gift on Sunday 11th June at London Bridge in an expression of love, solidarity and appreciation,\" the post read.    While the shock waves reverberate and the grief is still fresh in the wake of dark times, we remain standing, tall and united, in defiance of those who would divide us. Today we are giving away 1000 roses at London Bridge in an expression of love, solidarity and appreciation -- to show the world that our differences are not our labels. London Bridge is not falling down. And neither are we. #1000roseslondon #londonbridge #vigil #messageofpeace #london #england #home  #Alhamdulillah A post shared by Sara (@saralutfullah) on Jun 12, 2017 at 7:48am PDT\nThe money quickly poured in, and they ended up with more than triple the amount of roses they originally planned on buying.Volunteers handed out about 3,000 and left 500 more at the memorial site for a vigil that happened later that night.They still have money left over, too, and they plan to put it to good use. They hope to replicate the event soon but are still hashing out the details, Rob said.",

The route stretches 3,000 miles across 12 states, taking in the Rocky Mountains, the Great Plains, Monument Valley as well as the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts, and demands 170,000 feet worth of vertical climbs. It's a third longer than the Tour de France and has to be completed in half the time, without stopping.\"It's a surreal experience if you're out in the desert at 3am,\" Phil Magnus, a mechanic for British cyclist Shusanah Pillinger in 2014 and 2015, told CNN.Read More\"You don't want to take her off the bike because that is time wasted but you don't want it to be unsafe because she's so tired.\"At times we'd be leaning out of the car shouting at her to stay awake, just trying to keep her going to the time when she had to be taken off the bike. That's scary.\"Then you get out of the car and you realize you're standing on the Navajo Trail in the middle of the night and there's these fantastic smells coming from the desert. \"There's no-one else, not another human being you're aware of for miles and miles.\"JUST WATCHEDIs this the 'world's toughest cycle race'?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHIs this the 'world's toughest cycle race'? 01:32Pillinger made history as the first British woman to complete RAAM in 2015.She had come within 1,000 miles of the finish line the previous year before falling asleep on her bike, crashing and breaking her collar bone.The 2017 edition starts Tuesday in Oceanside, San Diego, and to complete it, riders must have reached Annapolis, Maryland within 12 days.For its 60 solo riders -- there are also teams of two, four and eight -- it'll be a festival of force-feeding calorific snacks and drinks, snatched pockets of sleep and an acute examination of their mental and physical attributes.\"You've got to want to do it,\" Magnus explained. \"Shu's probably not the best cyclist in the world so it's an even greater achievement that there are better cyclists out there than her that have failed. \"She's very strong willed, and an extremely determined and organized person in her mind. There were times when there were three of us in the support car on a 15-hour shift, it's the middle of the night, we're all starving and tired, and you'd lose something. READ: Extreme Cuba -- 1,450 kilometers in 57 hoursREAD: Chapel that's a shrine to cycling's fallen and heroesREAD: Yorkshire spawns cycling revolution\"Shu was the only person who knew where it was but you're frightened to ask her because she's been cycling for three days. You'd ask her and she would know. That's part of her psyche, she's not only involved it all of it, she's on top of it. \"Perhaps that's the type of personality you've got to be, a control freak who can trust your crew so that you can focus that tremendous mental and physical energy you need on the task.\"Pillinger's team gleaned some valuable sleep data from her failed 2014 attempt that helped to power her success a year later.It discovered that her best sleep cycle meant two or three 70-minute naps every 24 hours allowed her to function at her premium. A 210-minute sleep would be her reward for hitting her targets in a 48-hour period, but after a slow start to her 2015 voyage, she was around five days into the mission before she qualified for one.\"It was brutal and very emotional,\" Magnus said. \"We realized she was behind time after coming out of the Rockies but you can't tell her that, even though she's a very clever woman and might have been aware of it. \"You're deflated yourself, thinking 'How can it be? We've done everything we can as a crew not to waste any time so she must be cycling a bit slower.'\n\"Then coming off the Rockies with the benefit of a slight tail wind and some renewed vigour, she cycled in the region of 500 miles in two days and turned it around.\"When Pillinger reached Ulysses in Kansas she was mathematically certain to finish -- even if she kept going at her slowest predicted pace -- providing she didn't fall off.That was far from a certainty given the pounding her body and mind had taken. Later she spoke of a \"witching hour\" that was littered with paranoia, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and hallucinations that featured those goblins.The realization that success was within her grasp led to an emotional release for all Pillinger's support staff.\"It was a unique experience, all the crew were in the same place at the same time,\" Magnus recalled. \"It may have been the first time in seven days she got her 210-minute sleep and I was the last one to get to sleep. I cried because I knew she'd turned it round from a situation where she might not succeed.\"I marveled at her mental strength as much as her physical strength. You form such bonds as a crew, being stuck in car for 15 hours with people you've only met just a few times before.\"Everyone was focused for her, focused for each other and there was very, very positive energy -- the sort you'd like to take out of the atmosphere and stick in a bottle. It was raw, life-giving stuff.\"It was one of the great experiences of my life.\"Shusanah Pillinger (front, center) and her team, including Phil Magnus (second from left)For her next challenge Pillinger, who still commutes 26 miles by bike every day from her home in St Albans into London, will compete in the trans-continental -- a 1,790-mile race from Belgium to Greece. And this one has a twist -- it is a solo mission, without any crew at all.Video produced by Duarte Mendonca; Design by Brad Yendle",

The opposition leader said earlier they would proceed regardless of whether the government allowed them.Police arrest a protester in St Petersburg.In March, thousands joined protests in almost 100 cities across Russia, angered by a report that Navalny published accusing Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of corruption. Medvedev has denied the claims. Navalny was arrested, along with hundreds of others, and jailed for 15 days after being convicted of disobeying a police officer.His election campaign comes despite him being convicted of embezzlement and given a suspended sentence in February. Russian laws prohibit convicted people from running for office. Navalny says the charges against him are politically motivated.CNN's Tim Lister and journalist Mary Ilyushina reported from Moscow.

The Warriors defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 129-120 in Game 5 of the NBA Finals, clinching their second title in three years and their fifth in team history, avenging the loss to Cleveland after blowing a 3-1 lead a year ago.Durant led Golden State with 39 points, seven rebounds and five assists and was named NBA Finals MVP in a unanimous vote. He scored 30 or more points in all five Finals games. \"I couldn't sleep for two days,\" Durant told reporter Doris Burke. \"I was anxious. I was jittery. I just wanted to lay it all out there.\"Read MoreThe #NBAFinals MVP. The real MVP.@KDTrey5 x @MamaDurant! #NBAGIF #ThisIsWhyWePlay pic.twitter.com/d0tWLiUJTI\u2014 NBA (@NBA) June 13, 2017\nFollowing Monday's win, he embraced his mother, Wanda Durant, on the court.\"I'm proud of you, son,\" she said.Said Stephen Curry of his teammate: \"The way that he embraced the opportunity in The Finals, it was unbelievable.\"Durant: 'It's all about the group'This was the first time in NBA history the same two teams met in the NBA Finals for a third straight time. The Warriors won the title in 2015 in six games, while the Cavaliers dramatically won in 2016 in seven, becoming the first team in NBA history to win a series trailing 3-1.Durant, who famously called his mom the \"real MVP\" when he won the NBA MVP Award in 2014, knew what it felt like to lose a 3-1 lead -- and losing to LeBron James. In the 2012 NBA Finals, Durant was playing for the Oklahoma City Thunder and lost to James -- who was then with the Miami Heat -- in five games.\ud83d\ude01\ud83c\udfc6 pic.twitter.com/oDvvfrQWWO\u2014 GoldenStateWarriors (@warriors) June 13, 2017\nAfter the Cavaliers won the title in 2016, Golden State's focus turned to a player who wasn't in the NBA Finals: Durant. He was entering free agency after the Thunder gave away a 3-1 lead against the Warriors in the Western Conference finals. It spurred the most frenzy surrounding an NBA free agent decision since James announced in 2014 that he would return to the Cavaliers after spending four seasons with the Heat.With a superstar in Durant teaming with another in Curry -- as well as with Draymond Green and Klay Thompson -- it made Golden State a super team. The only unknown was if the team chemistry would be disrupted with Durant's addition.The answer: An emphatic no. The group was close to unstoppable in the regular season and postseason. While the Warriors didn't surpass their NBA record of 73 regular-season from 2016 (they settled for 67 this year), they still had the NBA's best regular-season record. Golden State went 16-1 in this year's playoffs, good for the highest winning percentage (.941) in a single postseason, surpassing the Los Angeles Lakers from 2001 (15-1, .938). Twelve of the Warriors' 16 playoff wins this postseason were by double digits.Not only could Durant coexist with Curry and the rest of the Warriors, but they also thrived.Larry is back in the Bay! \ud83c\udfc6 #DubNation pic.twitter.com/HXo6MH1gMy\u2014 GoldenStateWarriors (@warriors) June 13, 2017\n\"I hear all the narratives throughout the season that I was joining, I was hopping on bandwagons, I was letting everybody else do the work,\" Durant said. \"But then that was far from the truth. I came in and tried to help my team. Like I said, tried to be myself, be aggressive and sacrifice as well.\"There's some games I might not get shots, as many shots as I'm used to getting. Some games where Steph is going to go off and hit 13 threes or Klay might hit 60 or Draymond might get a triple-double with no points. But nobody cared, as long as we won. Andre Iguodala, who is right there, he continued to preach that every single day. It's all about the group. If your intentions are good, then that means as a team that we're moving in the right direction.\"So I just tried to think about that, but also add my flair to the game. And it feels amazing to win a championship with these guys. I can't wait to celebrate for the rest of the night -- well, maybe the rest of the summer.\"To go with Durant's numbers on Monday night, Curry had 34 points, 10 assists and six rebounds. Iguodala added 20 points. Green had 10 points and 12 rebounds, and Thompson had 11 points.\"You got a bunch of guys who are talented and can shoot and pass and dribble, and they're unselfish,\" Warriors head coach Steve Kerr said. \"There was never any question in my mind that this was going to work. So, this is the culmination of a year where they grew together and learned each other's games and got better and better all year, and it was just phenomenal to be part of.\"Kerr: 'Tonight was a little different' The Warriors also did much of this without their head coach on the sideline for an extended period of this postseason. Kerr coached the first two games of Golden State's first-round playoff series against the Portland Trail Blazers in April but stepped away because he was experiencing complications from back surgery from two years ago.This makes it worth it. pic.twitter.com/BtkZQU8LoJ\u2014 ESPN (@espn) June 13, 2017\nDuring his absence, Kerr was still involved at practice, but he handed the game day responsibilities to assistant coach Mike Brown. Golden State went 11-0 during that stretch before Kerr returned for Game 2 of the NBA Finals. This is Kerr's seventh championship, five of those as a player and two as a head coach.Kerr is the fourth coach in NBA history to win two championships in his first three seasons, joining Phil Jackson (1991, 1992), Bill Russell (1968, 1969) and John Kundla (1949, 1950), according to the Elias Sports Bureau. He was seen tearing up after the game.\"Winning is fantastic,\" Kerr said. \"I've been so lucky to be part of so many championship teams as a player and now as a coach, and it never gets old. But tonight was a little different, just based on the things I've had to go through during this time.\"James: Golden State 'built to last a few years'Monday's loss denied the Cavaliers a chance to repeat as champions and for James to get his fourth championship ring. It was his seventh consecutive trip to the NBA Finals, the only non-Boston Celtic to do so. It also kept the Cavaliers from becoming the first team in NBA history to come back from trailing 3-0 to win a best-of-seven series.\"As far as that team, they're going to be here for a while,\" James said of the Warriors. \"They're going to be around for a while. Pretty much all their big-name guys are in their 20s, and they don't show any signs of slowing down. So there's going to be a lot of teams that's trying to figure out ways to put personnel together to try and match that if they're able to actually face them in the playoff series, both Eastern Conference and Western Conference. Because they're built for -- from my eyes, they're built to last a few years.\"Another great battle, @cavs. #Respect pic.twitter.com/fjrAM4719V\u2014 GoldenStateWarriors (@warriors) June 13, 2017\nJames finished with 41 points, 13 rebounds, eight assists and two steals. He averaged a triple double during the NBA Finals.\"I left everything on the floor every game, all five games,\" James said. \"So for me personally, I have no reason to put my head down.\"Kyrie Irving had 26 points while JR Smith had 25.\"I broke down, so I couldn't really finish my speech,\" Cavaliers head coach Tyronn Lue said. \"A lot of guys cried because they wanted it bad. And that's all you can ask. If you give all your effort and all the fight and all the heart you got, it doesn't necessarily mean you're going to win, and that's what's tough about sports.\"I credit our guys. I thought they gave everything they had, and we fought, we competed, and we never gave in, but they beat us.\"",

        "content": "London (CNN)Five days on from the stalemate of the UK general election result, Europe's impatience with the Britain over Brexit is growing. EU officials are itching to start Brexit talks, but Prime Minister Theresa May is distracted by negotiations over the make-up of the new British government.Formal talks were due to start next Monday, June 19, but that date is looking less certain, though May insisted at a press conference with French leader Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday evening that talks would go ahead next week as planned. No-one is clear what the UK wants any more: the hung parliament election result has left May's plans for a clean break with Europe, under a so-called \"hard Brexit\", in tatters as her emboldened rivals in the UK Parliament demand it is watered down.JUST WATCHEDMay seeks deal with Northern Ireland's DUPReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMay seeks deal with Northern Ireland's DUP 02:57When the Prime Minister sat down for dinner with Emmanuel Macron in Paris Tuesday evening, the new French President -- who has set out his stall as an EU reformer -- likely reminded her that the clock is ticking. After dinner, the two leaders were due to watch a friendly soccer match between England and France. But even if that game goes into extra time, EU leaders are making clear to May that there can be no extension to the two-year period of negotiation before Britain must leave Europe in March 2019.Read MoreThere is frustration among EU leaders and officials that three months have already passed since May triggered Article 50, the device which started the Brexit process. Formal talks were due to start next Monday, June 19, but that date is looking shaky.'I can't negotiate with myself'In a joint interview with the Financial Times and other European newspapers Tuesday, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier, warned there was \"no time to waste.\"  He said: \"Next week, it will be three months since the sending of the Article 50 letter. We haven't negotiated, we haven't progressed. Thus we must begin this negotiation. We are ready as soon as the UK itself is ready.\" He added, pointedly: \"I can't negotiate with myself.\"Michel Barnier: 'I can't negotiate with myself.'Mats Persson, a former EU adviser to David Cameron, told CNN: \"What they [Macron and other EU leaders] want is clarity. Theresa May cannot really give him clarity.\"Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's chief Brexit negotiator, warned the UK risks a \"brutal exit\" if discussions aren't concluded within two years. In an interview with CNN Money's Europe Editor Nina dos Santos, Verhofstadt said: \"This needs to be done before March 29, 2019. Everything has to be behind us otherwise there will be a more brutal exit.\" Asked if there was a possibility of extending negotiations beyond the that deadline, he added: \"There is a need to start. Not to extend.\"Persson said that while March 2019 seemed a long way in the future, \"a lot of time has already passed in what is an extremely tight timetable. In terms of everything that has to be negotiated, there is actually very little time.\"JUST WATCHEDUK opposition: We want a jobs first BrexitReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHUK opposition: We want a jobs first Brexit 08:52With May's Conservative party not in overall control of the House Commons and with a new government yet to be formed, politicians in favor of a \"soft Brexit\" -- which is likely to include remaining part of the single market and customs union -- believe the impasse offers an opportunity to get their way. Conservative and Labour politicians are discussing privately the possibility of a cross-party commission that would agree a new deal. Even Michael Gove, the senior Conservative who led the campaign for Britain to leave the EU, has suggested a consensus can be reached. Brexit consensus?Gove, who has just been brought back to May's Cabinet as Environment Secretary, wrote in the Daily Telegraph that it was important to \"achieve a deal that can command the widest possible support.\" Yet some of his fellow hard Brexiteers are dismayed at any softening of an agreement with the EU and want the PM to stick to her red line, set out before the election, that \"no deal is better than a bad deal.\"EU insiders believe that Brussels negotiators would prefer Britain to present plans for a soft Brexit because it makes the \"no deal\" scenario, if talks break down by March 2019, less likely.Theresa May's Brexit to-do list is getting longerPersson, who is now head of international trade at EY, said that while the overall timetable for Brexit cannot now be changed, there was a way for the UK to buy time with Brussels whilst it sorts out its own position on a future relationship with Europe. This was because under the agreed sequence of negotiations the so-called \"divorce settlement\" -- the financial cost to the UK of leaving the EU -- was to be discussed first before talks will begin on a new free trade deal and what the new relationship will look like. Persson said: \"Maybe this can now work in the UK's favor because the UK can buy time while the divorce settlement is discussed. In-built into current sequencing there is the opportunity to buy time.\"",

May also reaffirmed the timetable for the country's departure from the European Union remains on track after talks with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris. The British PM had arrived in the French capital to discuss measures to tackle online extremism before attending a football match between the two nations, where a moment of silence paid tribute to the victims of Manchester and London. \"We have been very clear that we want to maintain a close relationship and a close partnership with the EU and individual member states in the future,\" May said at a joint press conference. \"And I confirmed to President Macron that the timetable for the Brexit negotiation remains on course and will begin next week.\"French President Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister Theresa May speak at a joint press conference at the Elysee Palace on Tuesday. The British leader said last week's snap election presented \"a unity of purpose\" among British voters to move forward with leaving the bloc and that there is \"willingness and intent\" from all involved to secure the best arrangement for both sides.

Thus we must begin this negotiation. We are ready as soon as the UK itself is ready,\" he said.Read: Merkel says EU ready for Brexit talksBarnier also dismissed the idea of extended negotiations beyond the end date of March 2019, indicating he wants all discussions concluded by November 2018 at the latest.\"If we work seriously, I see neither the usefulness nor the interest of pushing back this date. Why? Because every extra delay is a source ... of instability that we don't need, which the economy doesn't need, which employment doesn't need.\"German FM: 'Let's start the talks'Despite the disappointing results last week, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said after speaking to his British counterpart, Phillip Hammond, he believes the UK government will now start to pick up its feet on Brexit negotiations.Schaeuble said in a televised Bloomberg interview that Hammond had relayed that the party is now trying to work out what it means that \"a lot of young voters voted for Labour, not for the Conservative Party.\"  Theresa May's Brexit to-do list is getting longerThe German finance minister added that the outcome of the UK election had parallels to the recent French polls, in which many younger voters showed a strong pro-European sentiment when it came to the ballot box. Opinion: European unity might still be doomed\"There is a new opportunity to bring Europe forward,\" he said, explaining that both Hammond and he agreed from the first day that Brexit was a \"situation they had to accept\" and that they had to minimize the potential damage and maximize the mutual benefit.\u00a0When asked if he thought there was a possibility Brexit won't happen, Schaeuble said it was not valuable to speculate on that.\"The British government has said we will stay with the Brexit. We take the decision as a matter of respect. But if they wanted to change their decisions, of course, they would find open doors,\" he said. Increased pressureBarnier's comments will heap more pressure on May, who called the snap general election to give her a stronger hand at the Brexit negotiating table. After failing to achieve a majority, May met with the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland on Tuesday in the hopes of cobbling together a deal to ensure her minority government can get its Queen's Speech -- a flagship annual event in which the government lays out its policy agenda for the coming year -- through Parliament.Read: The two women who saved Theresa May could yet be her undoingMay's courting of the DUP for a potential \"confidence and supply\" relationship around key votes has drawn criticism because of the party's stance on same-sex marriage and abortion.",

Could sport be the solution? South Korean President Moon Jae-in apparently thinks so.In discussions with FIFA President Gianni Infantino this week, the South Korean President suggested  a \"regional bloc\" including both Koreas, China and Japan could join forces to host the 2030 football World Cup. A jointly hosted tournament \"could help create peace between the South and North and in the northeast region,\" Moon said, according to a spokesman. He also suggested it could lead to a European Union-style \"security and economic\" partnership between countries in the region.

Since his election in May, Moon has been trying to improve relations between Pyongyang and Seoul, amid a heightened security situation on the peninsula and ramped-up North Korean missile testing. While Moon has said he would be willing to visit Pyongyang and meet with Kim Jong Un, last week North Korea rejected an offer by a South Korean civic group to provide anti-malaria supplies, the first cross-border exchange approved by Seoul since January 2016. Throwing cold water on hopes from many in Moon's circle for improved North-South relations, Pyongyang said it wouldn't allow the visit due to new UN sanctions against it that South Korea supported. Moon has also struggled to patch up things with China, which was angered when Moon's predecessor approved the deployment of a US missile defense system in South Korea. Further roll-out of the THAAD system has been delayed by Moon's administration pending an environmental assessment. Even South Korean-Japanese relations aren't particularly positive, amid an ongoing dispute between Seoul and Tokyo over so-called \"comfort women\" held by the Japanese imperial army during World War II. JUST WATCHEDS. Korea wants fresh approach to N. KoreaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHS. Korea wants fresh approach to N. Korea 02:15Sporting cultureDespite their longstanding differences -- the two countries are still technically at war -- South and North Korea have a strong shared footballing history. The two teams regularly play each other in friendlies and at international competitions. In April, South Korea's women's soccer team traveled to Pyongyang for an Asian Cup qualifier.Footballing culture is strong in the two Koreas. North Korea has qualified for the World Cup more times than China, a country with a population 54 times larger, while South Korea's national football team is the most successful in Asia. However, not all sporting overtures have been successful. Pyongyang boycotted the 1988 Olympics, held in Seoul, after negotiations for the two countries to potential sharing hosting duties broke down. 'Strong message'FIFA's Infantino welcomed Moon's suggestion this week, adding that while there could be difficulties in achieving his goal, \"it is important to make such an effort based on belief.\" \"It could send a strong message just by mentioning such a vision,\" Infantino said, adding that he would bring up the matter with Chinese President Xi Jinping at a meeting later this week. International diplomacy aside, northeast Asia is well situated for the World Cup. South Korea, Japan and China all have extensive sporting facilities -- South Korea and Japan co-hosted the successful 2002 World Cup, the first time the tournament was held in Asia. Beijing hosted the 2008 Olympics, while Tokyo is due to host the 2020 games. If the three countries, along with North Korea, put forward a joint bid, it would likely be a compelling one, without the need for extensive stadium development as in Qatar, which is hosting the 2022 World Cup. However, even if Moon manages to thread the diplomatic needles, his vision will also face strong opposing bids from the UK, and Uruguay and Argentina, which are putting forward a joint bid to host the tournament on the hundredth anniversary of the inaugural World Cup in Uruguay.",

But talks with the party -- which is politically to the right of her Conservative Party -- have proved controversial. What is the DUP? Formed at the height of the conflict in Northern Ireland, the Democratic Unionist Party is proud to be British and fiercely loyal to the British monarch. Read MoreNorthern Ireland's dominant unionist party, they face off against republican party Sinn Fein, which wants to unite Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland. The DUP views the Republic as an existential threat to Northern Ireland's place in the UK.The DUP was founded by the firebrand Protestant preacher Ian Paisley in 1971 and the party remains socially conservative.Rev. Ian Paisley, pictured here in 1972, founded the DUP. The party backed Brexit but is against a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. Many of the DUP's voters are farmers who need to be able to sell products such as beef and milk across the border and rely on European Union subsidies.What's their position on gay rights and abortion?Theresa May's proposed alliance with the DUP triggered criticism because of its stance on abortion. This march in Belfast in 2015 saw thousands call for same sex marriage.The party has blocked the legalisation of same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland on multiple occasions. Meanwhile, abortion remains illegal except in specific medical cases and the DUP wants to keep it that way.What do they think about climate change?The denial of climate change is not a party policy, but DUP member of parliament Sammy Wilson has stated on his website that climate change is \"not man made\" and is a myth \"based on dodgy science.\"Wilson also praised US President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris Climate Change agreement as \"very wise.\"In their 2017 Westminster manifesto, the DUP called for a new sustainable energy strategy for Northern Ireland but made no mention of climate change or protecting the environment.What is their view on creationism?Some DUP members believe God created the world and do not believe in evolution. They include the former chair of the education committee, Mervyn Storey, who is a member of the Caleb Foundation, a creationist pressure group in Northern Ireland. He has called for creationism to be taught alongside evolution in science classes. Where do they stand on terror groups? Sectarian tensions in Northern Ireland are the highest they have been in decades and it is feared that the DUP, with a louder voice in Westminster, will elevate them further.The party has historical links to loyalist paramilitaries. Its founder Paisley and Peter Robinson, who followed him as party leader, were seen as rabble rousers for the cause.Sectarian tensions are high in Northern Ireland. During the 2017 election campaign, the Loyalist Communities Council, an organization backed by loyalist paramilitary groups, endorsed some DUP candidate.The party distanced itself, with outgoing DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson telling the BBC: \"We don't accept support from anyone who is engaged in paramilitary or criminal activity.\"Could this derail the peace process? The power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland collapsed in January when Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness stepped down because of a row with Foster over a renewable energy policy. McGuinness died in March following a short illness.DUP leader Arlene Foster at Downing Street Tuesday. A legal deadline to form a new coalition between the DUP and Sinn Fein passed before Easter without consensus.The DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement which, in 1998, set the stage to create a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland. But it said in its 2017 manifesto that although Stormont \"is far from perfect\" it wants to see power-sharing restored there as soon as possible.The power-sharing executive at Stormont collapsed five months ago.Since the UK election, the outgoing Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny and Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, have expressed concern that a deal with the DUP could put the Good Friday Agreement at risk.On Tuesday, former British Prime Minister John Major said he is \"concerned\" about a deal between his own Conservative Party and the DUP. In an interview with BBC Radio Major said: \"I am dubious about it both for peace process reasons but also for other reasons as well.\"Mr Major went on to say that a \"fundamental part of that peace process is that the UK government needs to be impartial between all the competing interests in Northern Ireland\".",

But 2017 has seen a resurgence. After being ousted in five sets by rival Roger Federer at the Australian Open, the Spaniard has been almost unstoppable.Heading into Roland Garros, he'd lost just one match on clay in 2017. And from the moment he stepped on court in Paris, few dared to bet against him lifting the title.For the third time in his career, Nadal won every set at a grand slam. He also pulls away from Pete Sampras in the men's all-time grand slam list; only Federer, with 18, has won more. But numbers aside, there were other reasons for Nadal to be emotional after his most recent victory.This was the last time the Mallorcan's uncle Toni Nadal -- who was invited on court to present the trophy on Sunday -- will see his nephew lift the French Open title after the pair agreed to end their coaching partnership in late 2016. Photos: The King of Clay over the yearsA lot has changed since a 19-year-old Rafael Nadal became only the second man in history to win Roland Garros at the first attempt. The bulging biceps, long hair and headband remain, but the Spaniard's sense of style has certainly changed.Hide Caption 1 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2005 \u2013 Nadal went into his first French Open as an inexperienced 18-year-old and emerged a grand slam champion -- beating Roger Federer in the semifinals on his 19th birthday. The 2005 season was the birth of what would go on to be Nadal's classic look: sleeveless top and three-quarter length shorts.Hide Caption 2 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2006 \u2013 By the following year, Nadal had cemented his place among tennis' elite and was developing a fearsome reputation on clay. This time wearing a slightly less garish light blue, Nadal picked up his second consecutive French Open title by becoming the first man to beat Roger Federer in a grand slam final.Hide Caption 3 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2007 \u2013 In 2007, the then 20-year-old Nadal's status as the 'King of Clay' was sealed. Defeat to Federer at the Masters Series in Hamburg ended an 81-match unbeaten streak on clay, which remains a men's Open Era record today. At that year's French Open, Nadal opted for the reverse of 2006's top-bandana combo -- this time with matching trainers to boot.Hide Caption 4 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2008 \u2013 A year later, Nadal opted for a variation on his debut French Option look, this time sporting an all-green combo. Nadal reached world No. 1 for the first time in his career in 2008, helped by his fourth consecutive Roland Garros title -- matching Bjorn Borg's record of consecutive trophies, while also becoming only the seventh man to win a grand slam without dropping a set.Hide Caption 5 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2009 \u2013 Nadal's first dramatic transformation came in 2009. Gone were the sleeveless shirts and three-quarter lengths, in came the sleeves and fluorescent, clashing colors. Perhaps it was the sleeves restricting the powerful arms (or maybe a knee injury), but Nadal suffered the first of only two French Open defeats. Despite a shock fourth-round loss to Robin Soderling, Nadal set a record of 31 consecutive wins at Roland Garros.Hide Caption 6 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2010 \u2013 In 2010, Nadal bounced back from the 2009 disappointment with a daring multicolored number. He went on to exact revenge on Soderling, beating him in the final after the Swede had upset Federer in the quarterfinals. Federer's failure to reach the semis meant Nadal regained the world No. 1 spot, while it was also the second time he won the French Open without dropping a set.Hide Caption 7 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2011 \u2013 The following year, Nadal dialed down the brightness, instead choosing to return to one of his earliest Roland Garros styles. And it worked -- he maintained his No. 1 ranking throughout the clay court season and beat perennial rival Federer in the final.Hide Caption 8 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2012 \u2013 Perhaps in an attempt to gain the upper hand on opponents by blending into the clay, Nadal opted for an orange-ish-red look for the first time at the French Open. It appeared to work, as Nadal dropped just 30 games in the first five rounds, before beating Djokovic in four sets in the final to claim his seventh Roland Garros title and surpass Borg as the tournament's most successful player.Hide Caption 9 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2013 \u2013 The 2013 French Open was the debut of Nadal's latest wardrobe change: the short shorts. In an all-Spanish final, Nadal defeated David Ferrer in straight sets -- although bizarrely dropped from fourth in the world to fifth after his victory.Hide Caption 10 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2014 \u2013 Perhaps a sign of entering into his late 20s, Nadal's colors switched from fluorescent to more mellow tones. Despite being hampered by injuries and suffering surprise defeats early in the clay court season, Nadal grinded out arguably his most impressive Roland Garros victory. Another victory in the final against Djokovic took him to 14 grand slams (level with Pete Sampras) and it was his fifth straight French Open triumph.Hide Caption 11 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2015 \u2013 Nadal's struggle to find form continued into 2015's clay court season, dropping outside of the world's top five for the first time since 2005. Looking like an athletic version of the Cookie Monster, Nadal crashed out of the French Open in the quarterfinals to Djokovic. It ended his 39-match unbeaten run and marked just his second defeat on the Parisian clay.Hide Caption 12 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2016 \u2013 The following year, the shorts got even shorter and the two-tone top returned as Nadal exited the French Open in the third round -- although this time it was a wrist injury that defeated him. Despite the disappointment, there was another milestone for Nadal as he became only the eighth man to reach 200 grand slam wins.Hide Caption 13 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2017 \u2013 Nadal debuted his strong blue look against Benoit Paire in the first round and the King of Clay went on to complete \"'La Decima\" of 10 Roland Garros titles.Hide Caption 14 of 14Nadal now turns his attention to Wimbledon.Moving away from his beloved clay courts and with Federer expected to return to the men's draw, tougher tests lie ahead for the Spaniard on the grass.Visit cnn.com/tennis for more news and videosBut for now, at least, Nadal reigns supreme.",

Federer's failure to reach the semis meant Nadal regained the world No. 1 spot, while it was also the second time he won the French Open without dropping a set.",
            "2011 \u2014 The following year, Nadal dialed down the brightness, instead choosing to return to one of his earliest Roland Garros styles. And it worked -- he maintained his No. 1 ranking throughout the clay court season and beat perennial rival Federer in the final.",
            "2012 \u2014 Perhaps in an attempt to gain the upper hand on opponents by blending into the clay, Nadal opted for an orange-ish-red look for the first time at the French Open. It appeared to work, as Nadal dropped just 30 games in the first five rounds, before beating Djokovic in four sets in the final to claim his seventh Roland Garros title and surpass Borg as the tournament's most successful player.",

Navalny is hoping the scale of the protests will match the turnout of demonstrations in March, when thousands took to the streets across Russia.Read MoreHe was arrested and jailed for disobeying a police officer during the March protests, which appeared to be a response to a long-form \"investigation\" that Navalny and his Anti-Corruption Foundation posted on YouTube. The 50-minute report claimed Medvedev has assembled \"a corruption empire\" of luxury properties, yachts and vineyards. It has amassed almost 23 million views since it was posted on March 2.Medvedev denies the allegations.Isn't it hard to protest in Russia?Police detain a protester in Moscow on Monday. The Russian authorities demand that applications be filed and approved for any rallies, protests or public events. The place and the timing must be approved by the city authorities.However -- as was the case earlier this  year -- Navalny insisted they would go ahead whether they were authorized or not.As a result, once again, numerous arrests were made Monday. Navalny himself was detained as he left his home to head to the Moscow event.State news service Tass reported on Navalny's arrest, but ignored the protests.Instead, it described the large numbers of people on the streets Moscow -- which it estimated at 270,000 -- as participating \"in festive events\" to mark Russia Day.What's with the ducks?\u0412 \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0443\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0443 pic.twitter.com/ZotmR3Noa6\u2014 \u041e\u0412\u0414-\u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e (@OvdInfo) June 12, 2017\nA common theme in March and at the latest round of rallies is the presence of rubber ducks, waved in the air by protesters.This is a nod to an allegation that Medvedev has a custom-made duck house at one of his lavish properties. According to a Twitter post by OVD -- an independent group monitoring arrests -- one huge duck was \"detained\" by police in St. Petersburg after officers took exception to it being tossed in the air.

Navalny says the charges against him are politically motivated.What will the protests mean for Putin?Young Russians are fed up, and the Kremlin has taken noticeThe government has certainly taken notice of previous protests.And ahead of the latest outpouring of dissatisfaction, the Prosecutor General tried to quell the Moscow protest by declaring it illegal and warning: \"Law enforcement agencies will be forced to take all necessary measures to stop provocations, mass unrest or any actions leading to a violation of public security, creating conditions for threatening the life and health of citizens.\"Opinion polls have suggested persistent anger with corruption. In a survey carried out in March by the Levada Center, 65% described corruption as absolutely unacceptable.However, few Russians blame Putin: only 17% think corruption has worsened since he became President. But many say it's endemic: 45% believe Putin wouldn't succeed in fighting corruption, the highest percentage recorded in five years.CNN's Oksana Brown contributed to this report.",

Photos released by police on Saturday show leather-made belts linked to disposable water bottles covered in tape. \"I have not seen this tactic in the UK before -- where terrorists create maximum fear by strapping fake explosives to themselves,\" said Cmdr. Dean Haydon of the Metropolitan Police, who's leading the investigation. The three men rammed into pedestrians on London Bridge on June 3 before going on a stabbing rampage at bars at nearby Borough Market. By the time the carnage was over, eight people were dead.

One attacker killed 86 people in France when he plowed through a large crowd celebrating the national Bastille Day last July. In Berlin, another one rammed into a Christmas market, killing 12. At the time of the London attacks, Butt was out on bail in a fraud case dating to October last year. He had not been charged in that case due to insufficient evidence, police said. Two British counterterrorism sources told CNN that the arrest was part of an effort by British police and the MI5 intelligence agency to take known Islamist extremists off the streets by going after them for crimes unrelated to terrorism. Ceramic knives, van carrying explosivesPolice are calling on anyone with information about the ceramic knives.In addition to the fake explosives, police have released images of ceramic knives found on or near the assailants and the van they used to hit people on the bridge.Three 12-inch pink ceramic kitchen knives were found with tape around the handles and leather straps attached to them to keep the weapons on the attackers' wrists.Inside the van, police found two blowtorches as well as what appeared to be 13 Molotov cocktails made from wine bottles and a possible flammable liquid.The van also had office chairs and a suitcase. Police believe the attackers told relatives they were using it to move. Arrests continueOn Sunday evening, a 19-year old man in east London was arrested in connection with the terror attack, London's Metropolitan Police said. The man was apprehended in Barking \"on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism,\" the statement said.

Navalny's YouTube channel, which had been broadcasting live to more than 50,000 people as the protests got underway, lost light and sound in the studio.\u0421 \u0414\u043d\u0451\u043c \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438! pic.twitter.com/CkfZXT6EKo\u2014 Alexey Navalny (@navalny) June 12, 2017\nThe 41-year-old has been mobilizing support on social networks, and hopes the rallies will rattle the Kremlin, as those held earlier this year did.Navalny posted his first YouTube video, a step-by-step instruction guide showing how to build an \"agitation cube,\" a box-like tent structure with his image emblazoned on the side, in July 2013.Read MoreThe clip marked the start of the Russian dissident's campaign to be elected Moscow mayor, and the humble beginning of his YouTube revolution.Navalny Live: 'People are sick of not being heard'Navalny was arrested in Moscow during anti-corruption protests in March.  Oksana Baulina, who now runs Navalny Live, the live-streaming companion to the original Navalny YouTube channel, worked on that mayoral bid. Wearing an old campaign t-shirt which says \"Only Navalny, only hard work\" in big, black letters, Baulina says the events of 2013 give her hope.\"Experts or even supporters didn't believe that Navalny would be allowed to take part in the mayoral elections,\" she says, let alone that he'd come away with 27% of the vote, narrowly falling short of a runoff. Navalny has now set his sights on Russia's 2018 presidential election, despite being found guilty of embezzlement and given a 5-year suspended sentence in February. Russian laws prohibit convicted criminals from running for office. Navalny says the charges against him are politically motivated. The Navalny Live team, based just outside Moscow city center, is also undeterred. \"Navalny 2018\" stickers are affixed to every laptop, and boxes of campaign signs are stacked in the corridor. At one point, Navalny himself wanders into the studio to check on things.Leonid Volkov, Navalny's presidential campaign manager, is anchoring a lively discussion program about internet freedom. Throughout the broadcast, Baulina types furiously. This is not just about sending a message to the viewers, she explains. During every show they coordinate comments on YouTube and conversations on Twitter using hashtags.\u00a0 People are \"sick and tired\" of not being heard, she says. \"They need this.\"Young Russians are fed up, and the Kremlin has taken noticeThe numbers are impressive: more than 300,000 people now subscribe to Navalny Live, which produces up to three broadcasts a day each week; the original Navalny YouTube channel has passed the 1 million mark.\u00a0 Navalny's most-watched video is a 50-minute graphics-heavy investigation into alleged corruption by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, which has notched up well beyond 20 million views.\u00a0 Medvedev has denied the allegations in the video. But with increased results come increased risks. In March, that video lit a spark under the biggest anti-government protests Russia has seen in years. Thousands joined rallies in almost 100 cities across Russia. Navalny himself was arrested, and jailed for 15 days.At Navalny Live, the mission that day was to stream the protests as they happened, since state-run media was not covering them at all. Starting early, with the protests in Russia's far east, Baulina's team worked their way across the country's time zones. By the time the live stream reached Moscow, she says, it had peaked at 140,000 simultaneous viewers. And then there was a knock at the door.Under the pretext of failing to comply, first with a fire alert, and then with a bomb threat, Baulina and several of her colleagues were arrested and detained for seven days. \u00a0It wasn't the most comfortable experience, she says, but it only served to strengthen her resolve.\u00a0 \u00a0\"Actually, after you go through the first arrest, you realize it's not as difficult as you thought it would be.\" The point, she says with a smile, is \"to build a beautiful Russia of the future.\"\u00a0'I spit on you, Navalny'JUST WATCHEDRussia promises crackdown after large protestReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRussia promises crackdown after large protest 02:29There are signs, though, that the ground may be shifting beneath this opposition movement.\u00a0In a rare break from the Kremlin's long-held policy of appearing to ignore Navalny, long-time Vladimir Putin ally and billionaire oligarch Alisher Usmanov -- named by Navalny as an accomplice in Medvedev's alleged web of corruption -- decided to take him on at his own game.\u00a0 \u00a0In two rambling video messages on his own newly-created YouTube channel, Usmanov called Navalny a liar and promised to sue him for defamation -- something he has now successfully done.\u00a0His payoff lines -- versions of \"I spit on you, Navalny\" -- have become something of an internet meme in Russia.\u00a0Baulina says she thinks this is a good thing, though she worries it might simply be a ploy by Usmanov to take the heat off Medvedev: \"It somehow shows that it's not us who follow their agenda, but they who follow ours.\" \u00a0JUST WATCHEDGeography of Russia protests 'really stunning' ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHGeography of Russia protests 'really stunning'  06:13And then there was the highly produced, not to mention highly controversial, video entitled \"Hitler 1945/Navalny 2018,\" which racked up two million views on YouTube before it was deleted. Navalny believes the video was the work of the Russian government. Russia's independent TV channel Dozhd came to a similar conclusion, citing four sources close to the Kremlin who say the Kremlin would try to undermine Navalny. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied any involvement in the video.\u00a0 \u00a0Navalny's live video operation is not a high budget affair. Brightly-colored paper screens roll down to form the backdrop, and there are four dedicated employees. During CNN's visit to the station, a woman in her 60s arrived nervously clutching a carefully-wrapped gray plastic package. Inside was cash, she said, to donate to Navalny's campaign. Staff were forced to explain that they can only take electronic donations.\u00a0\"But I don't like using a computer and sharing my thoughts with anyone,\" the would-be donor pleaded. \"I learned how to open Navalny Live on YouTube --  that's enough for me.\"\u00a0In a country where opposition is so tightly controlled, YouTube is an increasingly powerful tool. Whether it will be enough for Navalny is still highly debatable.\u00a0This story has been updated to reflect developments on the ground in Russia.

Many MPs are angry over what they see as an unnecessary vote that has cost several lawmakers their seats and are demanding she run a more open, collegiate government after her first months of a dictatorial regime. With her government majority at zero, May has no control over Parliament a week away from the Queen's Speech, when new laws are presented, and the scheduled start of Brexit talks. Her only chance of an overall working majority is with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), a fringe political party in Northern Ireland, which is demanding a package of measures on finance in return for support in Parliament.At one of its most important moments in its history, the country is rudderless and facing a constitutional crisis.Read MoreIn throwing away her majority on an early election, May has lost control of the Conservative Party, Parliament, her policy manifesto and Brexit. 5 reasons Theresa May's troubles have just begunThe clock is tickingOn June 19,  the Queen, in traditional state coach and full regalia, will travel from Buckingham Palace to Parliament to unveil the new government's legislative agenda. On that same day, UK and EU officials in Brussels are due to start negotiations on Britain's exit from Europe. May should be able to use these two set-piece events to shape the country's future. Yet she no longer wields power over either.It is even unclear whether May will be Prime Minister by this time next week. The threat of a leadership challenge from inside her own party hangs over her head -- a threat vividly underlined Sunday when her former colleague-turned-nemesis George Osborne labeled her a \"dead woman walking.\" JUST WATCHEDElection shock undercuts UK on world stageReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHElection shock undercuts UK on world stage 01:29So who is really in charge?Over the weekend May, who appeared visibly shaken in TV interviews, used the one power that remains in her grip -- a reshuffle of the Cabinet -- to try to shore up her position and win allies. But even in this her lack of authority prevented her from major moves or sackings. The most senior ministers stayed in post, while May was forced to bring back into the Cabinet one of her long-term political foes, Michael Gove, to appease an angry Conservative Party.Michael Gove takes over as Environment Secretary in May's weekend reshuffle.MPs and ministers also feel they were treated disdainfully by May's two chiefs of staff, Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy, who resigned over the weekend as the PM tried to make concessions. If the PM fails to give a convincing performance to the backbench Conservative MPs on Monday, known collectively as the 1922 committee, she could face a leadership challenge within days.Michael Fallon, the Defense Secretary who, for now, remains loyal,  served notice Sunday that the PM had to start being more consensual when he said: \"We're going to see more collective government.

Talks between the government and the DUP are due to restart Tuesday after confusion over the weekend whether an outline deal had been reached, but the Northern Irish party is in the driving seat as they know they are May's only option of forming a government.There are fears among more liberal Conservative MPs that the socially conservative DUP will demand a scaling back of abortion and gay rights -- but No. 10 sources have insisted these issues are not on the table. If May had won a majority last Thursday, she would have been converting the policy agenda in the Conservative election manifesto into laws in the Queen's Speech. That power is now lost. As the legislative package is being drafted this week, May is reportedly ready to axe key manifesto policies such as grammar schools and her controversial plan to reform elderly care -- the measure that marked the turning point in her election campaign.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn yesterday said his party would start drawing up its own policies for the Queen's Speech, challenging legislation before it is even introduced, in a sign that every single vote in the new Parliament go down to the wire.JUST WATCHEDWhat to know about Jeremy CorbynReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhat to know about Jeremy Corbyn 01:16  Brexit: 'Look again'Finally, and perhaps most crucially, May has lost control over Brexit -- the very reason she called an election three years early. With talks in Brussels just seven days away, it is clear that the plan for a hard Brexit, in which the UK severs all ties with the EU, including free market membership, is now in doubt. Ministers have urged May to put forward a more \"pragmatic\" vision for Brexit rather than \"ideological\", one that it less virulently anti-EU. This certainly means a softer Brexit is now on the cards. Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Conservative Party in Scotland who is credited with a surprise win of 13 seats for the party there, said yesterday that the PM needed to \"look again\" at Brexit. Davidson and the 13 Scottish Conservative MPs are travelling to Westminster Monday to underline their significance: without these seats May would have no chance of forming a government with anyone. But pro-Brexit Tory MPs will not let go of a hard Brexit without a fight: they are furious at any moves to water down something they see as the will of the British people.With May's dwindling authority over her party, Parliament, her manifesto and Brexit, it is no wonder that last night she failed to confirm whether she planned to serve a full term in office, telling Sky News: \"I said during the election campaign that if re-elected I would intend to serve a full term.\"But what I'm doing now is actually getting on with the immediate job.\" The question is, for how long.",

        "content": "London (CNN)Two women are poised to rescue British Prime Minister Theresa May after her disastrous election performance last week. But they could also become the embattled leader's biggest threat, making demands that could infuriate lawmakers with the power to bring May down.After losing her overall Parliamentary majority in an election that she was not required to hold until 2020, May is now courting support from Arlene Foster, the leader of the marginal Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) in Northern Ireland. The DUP won 10 seats and is now the Prime Minister's only hope of retaining control in Parliament. She also needs the backing of Ruth Davidson -- leader of the Conservatives in Scotland, which won an unexpected 13 new seats, ensuring May wasn't completely wiped out.From left: Ruth Davidson, Theresa May and Arlene Foster.Keeping both women happy, especially Foster, will be essential for May, who repeatedly promised stability in her campaign but delivered political chaos instead.A Brexit bungle Read MoreMay and her administration is scheduled to start Brexit talks with EU leaders in just seven days.If those talks are not delayed, she will have to form a government and then get a new Brexit plan in play in a matter of days. Her party's losses were widely seen as the country's rejection of her \"hard Brexit\" vision, and her own party is now divided on whether to stick to the plan or return to the drawing board.British PM Theresa May seeks lifeline after bruising election resultDavidson has made clear she wants May to soften her stance on Brexit, a move that would further rattle anti-EU Conservative backbenchers, many of whom pushed for the Brexit referendum in the first place.Those backbenchers wield enormous power in the party, and although they say they are sticking by May, there's talk of revolt.May had vowed to pull the country out of the EU's single market and customs union, essentially a free-trade zone, a move that many worry will batter the British economy. Scotland voted overwhelmingly to stay in the EU, so most Scottish party leaders have backed a softer Brexit.The EU has said that if Britain wants to retain open terms of trade, it would have to keep its borders open to EU citizens -- but closing borders was at the heart of the Brexit campaign and some backbenchers will see a U-turn as going against the will of the people.Foster leads a hardline anti-EU party and is supportive of some of May's  Brexit plans. But she could make demands that will be tough for May to achieve. She wants Northern Ireland (which is British territory) to keep its border with the EU-member Republic of Ireland open. It's hard to see how that could be achieved without, at the very least, keeping Britain in the EU customs union -- which May has pledged to leave.Foster has let the Prime Minister squirm for days as the DUP stalls in making its support for May official. As well as her Brexit demands, Foster is likely to demand a substantial increase in government funding for Northern Ireland.LGBT and abortion rightsA key point of tension between Davidson and Foster is on LGBT rights. Same-sex marriage was legalized in England and Wales in 2013, and in Scotland a year later. But while Northern Ireland's assembly has passed a similar gay marriage bill, it was blocked by the DUP, whose roots lie in evangelical Christianity.Merkel: EU ready for Brexit negotiations Davidson, who is gay, has campaigned hard for LGBT rights and has already expressed concerns to May about the DUP's potential influence, both in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. \"I asked for a categoric assurance that if any deal or scoping deal was done with the DUP there would be absolutely no rescission of LGBTI rights in the rest of the UK, in Great Britain, and that we would use any influence that we had to advance LGBTI rights in Northern Ireland,\" Davidson told the BBC. \"It's an issue very close to my heart and one that I wanted categoric assurances from the Prime Minister on, and I received (them).\"As a Protestant Unionist about to marry an Irish Catholic, here's the Amnesty Pride lecture I gave in Belfast...https://t.co/NdRaT2s3W5\u2014 Ruth Davidson (@RuthDavidsonMSP) June 9, 2017\nThe DUP was on the frontline of the Save Ulster from Sodomy campaign, which failed to stop the 1982 decriminalization of homosexual sex in Northern Ireland. Abortion is also still a criminal offense in Northern Ireland, except when pregnancy puts a mother's life in danger. The DUP is firmly against bringing abortion rights to the territory, even for rape victims.While May will be trying to keep Davidson, Foster and her backbenchers happy, she will have another group of people to win back -- the British public. A petition calling for the Prime Minister's ouster over her alliance with the DUP on Change.org had reached more than 700,000 signatures by Monday.A spokesman for May would not confirm or deny whether the Prime Minister would push the DUP on LGBT rights.\"This government's record in terms of LGBT rights is a very proud one and one which the government is very proud to promote and stand by,\" he said. Foster denied allegations that her party would be a negative influence on the national Parliament in the Belfast Telegraph on Monday, saying she was focused on getting a good deal for Northern Ireland in Brexit talks.  \"To those locally who are complaining the loudest about our position of influence, I say to them that the time for unreasonable behavior and unrealistic demands is over,\" she said. \"When I meet with the Prime Minister in London tomorrow I will be mindful of our responsibility to help bring stability to the nation at this time of challenge.\"",

The two-time FIFA World Player of the Year temporarily moved over from the Houston Dash as City bolstered its squad with the firm goal of winning the UEFA Women's Champions League tournament this year. Follow @cnnsport\n\nThe 34-year-old scored three times for the club in 11 games, as she helped boost City in its European campaign that was ultimately halted by French powerhouse Lyon, which eliminated the English club over two legs in the semifinals. To play again on European soil is tempting, Lloyd admits, particularly the chance to lift the continent's holy grail.\"I would love to win a Champions League final,\" she tells CNN Sport. \"I'm not closing any chapters right now, and [I'm] leaving all doors open.

Manager Nick Cushing's squad is packed with internationals -- eight from England alone -- ensuring City has set the benchmark in Britain.  The Citizens are the reigning Women's Super League champions, and were looking to make an impact in the Champions League.  The recruitment of Lloyd was certainly seen as coup, and she played a pivotal role in both the FA Cup and Champions League -- even if a red card in the Women's Super League Spring Series meant she only played four out of a possible eight games in the league.READ: Alex Morgan vs. Carli Lloyd -- US stars face off in Women's Champions LeagueDuring her time in England, the US captain has been impressed by the standards across the pond. \"Here, you're playing with more skilful players,\" she reflects. \"Players who are very technical on the ball, who read the game very well.\"\"So, I think for me, it's been a good indication of where the American side is, and where the English side is ...

The scale of En Marche's win was marred only by poor turnout -- only 48.7% of eligible voters went to the polls. Macron's party, founded just a year ago, is expected to win between 415 and 445 seats in the lower house when next Sunday's second round of voting concludes.Such a margin of victory in the 577-seat house would give Macron the majority he so badly craves to further his political revolution.

He has drawn candidates from a cross-section of society, including a former bullfighter, a Nobel Prize winner and an ex-fighter pilot.The move appears to have paid off as Macron's party, which has grown out of his grass-roots movement, is projected to record a stunning victory.\"We are grateful for the trust you have placed in all the new faces of the Republic,\" Catherine Barbaroux, the party's president, told supporters after seeing the projected results.How the elections workThe final results will be confirmed next Sunday after the second round of voting.

        "content": "Story highlightsNo deal yet with Democratic Unionist Party to prop up Conservative governmentThe Irish peace process is at risk, Irish PM warnsLondon (CNN)UK Prime Minister Theresa May was clinging to power by her political fingertips on Sunday after losing her parliamentary majority in last Thursday's election, as an agreement with the minority Democratic Unionist Party that would keep the Conservatives in power was still not finalized. May's co-chiefs of staff, Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, handed in their resignations on Saturday following the disastrous election. The vote was called by May to strengthen her position ahead of talks to leave the European Union, in the end it left her weakened.Both Downing Street and the DUP issued statements late Saturday saying talks over a deal to prop up the government would resume next week amid concern among more liberal Conservatives about May hitching her wagon to the right-wing Northern Irish party. Earlier, Downing Street had said a preliminary agreement had already been secured. The DUP is similar to the \"religious right\" in the United States and takes a hardline stance on social issues, such as same-sex marriage and abortion. Corbyn will push a substantial amendment to the Queen's Speech. Meanwhile the main opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that he stands ready to lead the country and that a new general election could be held within months. Read More\"I think its quite possible there'll be an election later this year or early next year, and that might be a good thing, because we cannot go on with a period of great instability,\" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday . 'Dead woman walking'Theresa May: the Icarus of UK politics Many of those Conservatives now opposing May are those who wanted to remain in the EU. \"Theresa May is a dead woman walking, it just remains to be seen how long she remains on death row,\" George Osborne, the former UK chancellor who was sacked by May last year, told the BBC on Sunday. The right-wing British press speculated Sunday that Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a former journalist and the former Mayor of London, was plotting a leadership coup. But Osborne, who is now the editor of London's Evening Standard newspaper, downplayed the prospect. \"He's in a permanent leadership campaign so I am not sure it qualifies as news,\" he said. The new arithmetic of the House of Commons will also makes Brexit negotiations more difficult. The DUP, although it wants to leave the EU, will insist on keeping the single market that allows the free flow of goods across the UK's border with Ireland. \"One piece of good news is the whole election has put pay to a hard Brexit,\" Osborne told CNN. \"The votes aren't there now in the (House of) Commons for taking Britain out of all the economic arrangements we have with the European Union,\" he said. Ireland: Alliance could endanger peace Winners and losers from the UK electionIn Ireland, there is growing concern that by bringing the DUP into government, London will no longer be able to perform its traditional role as an impartial broker in the Northern Ireland peace process. May spoke to the Irish Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Enda Kenny over the phone on Sunday.\"The Taoiseach indicated his concern that nothing should happen to put the Good Friday Agreement at risk and the challenge that this agreement will bring,\" the Irish government said in a statement. \"He also noted the absence of any nationalist voice in Westminster following the election.\"The Good Friday Agreement was a major development in the peace process of the 1990s that brought peace to the region after decades of conflict. Seven Republican Sinn Fein members who want a united Ireland were also elected on Thursday, but they do not attend or vote as the party does not recognize Westminster rule.Pressure from all sidesMay called the general election three years earlier than required by law, with the aim of sweeping an even greater majority for her party before Brexit talks in just eight days to take the country out of the EU. But a dismal campaign has left the Prime Minister fending off a mutiny within her own party. Conservative MPs are publicly airing their anger, some calling for her ouster and others demanding radical change in her style of leadership.What the UK election result could mean for BrexitRuth Davidson, the openly gay leader of the Conservatives in Scotland, told the BBC she had words with May over the DUP's record on LGBT rights.Defense Secretary Michael Fallon said on the Andrew Marr show he believed the Conservative Party and the DUP will be able to hold together in government. \"They (the DUP) are going to support us on the big Brexit, economic and security issues facing this country,\" he said. On Sunday, May appointed former BBC journalist Damien Green as First Secretary of State -- effectively May's deputy Prime Minister -- in a reshuffle of her cabinet. Many key positions were unchanged.Michael Gove has been appointed Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. He was also a backer of Brexit, and lost to May in the 2015 Tory leadership election.Her new chief of staff will be Gavin Barwell, a former MP who was ousted from his south London constituency as a result of Labour's unexpectedly strong showing in the election. May said that he would bring \"considerable experience\" to the post.May promises 'stability and certainty'In her post-election reshuffle, May said she appointed ministers that reflect \"the wealth of talent and experience across the Conservative Party.\" In a television interview Sunday with Sky News at Downing Street, May say she would help deliver the \"stability and certainty\" the country needs during the reshuffling. When asked if she would continue her term in office May said, \"I said during the election campaign that if re-elected I would intend to serve a full term. But what I'm doing now is actually getting on with the immediate job.\" May also said she would be meeting with her cabinet on Monday and going to France on Tuesday for meetings with French President Macron.

The 'Decima.'Indeed it is a feat that may never be duplicated. He collapsed to the court when Wawrinka sent a backhand into the net and seconds later an emotional Nadal sunk his head into his towel while in his chair. He was soon cradling the famous trophy like a baby. Read More\"It's truly incredible,\" Nadal told the crowd. \"In this final, to win the Decima is very, very special. I'm really emotional.\"The feeling I have here is impossible to describe. Difficult to compare to other places. For me the nerves, the adrenaline I feel when I play on this court is impossible to compare to another feeling.

Toni won't travel with his nephew next year, as he steps aside to focus on his work at Nadal's new tennis academy in Mallorca. Only twelve months ago a tearful Nadal bailed from his favorite tournament in Paris in the first week with a wrist injury, another in a seemingly endless list of ailments to derail the 31-year-old. Temporarily, that is. Be it his knees, wrist or appendicitis, Nadal has always managed to recover and rediscover some of his finest tennis, despite admitting to having doubts. Those same doubts, he said, prompted him to keep working hard. Agonizingly close to winning a 15th major at the Australian Open in January -- he lost to great rival and Wawrinka's fellow Swiss Roger Federer after holding a break lead in the fifth set -- there was simply no denying Nadal at Roland Garros as he ended a three-year drought at majors. Asked if No. 10 was more special than the others, Nadal said yes. \"It's true that this one is gonna be one of the more special ones for the number, for what happened on the ceremony after the final, for so many things,\" he told reporters. \"And because I am 31 already and not a kid anymore.\"Because of the level of tennis and accepting that I have had problems, physical problems for the last period of time, it's an important one.\"Reflecting on his accomplishments at the French Open after a montage showed his converted match points in each of his French Open successes, Nadal added that he never thought he'd be playing the game for so long. \"In 2005, I thought in 2017 I'd be fishing on my boat in Mallorca,\" he said.Nadal moved into sole possession of second place in men's majors, pulling away from American Pete Sampras and once again getting to within three of Federer, who skipped Roland Garros to prepare for the grass-court swing. READ: Nadal says French Open title 'more special' Photos: The King of Clay over the yearsA lot has changed since a 19-year-old Rafael Nadal became only the second man in history to win Roland Garros at the first attempt. The bulging biceps, long hair and headband remain, but the Spaniard's sense of style has certainly changed.Hide Caption 1 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2005 \u2013 Nadal went into his first French Open as an inexperienced 18-year-old and emerged a grand slam champion -- beating Roger Federer in the semifinals on his 19th birthday. The 2005 season was the birth of what would go on to be Nadal's classic look: sleeveless top and three-quarter length shorts.Hide Caption 2 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2006 \u2013 By the following year, Nadal had cemented his place among tennis' elite and was developing a fearsome reputation on clay. This time wearing a slightly less garish light blue, Nadal picked up his second consecutive French Open title by becoming the first man to beat Roger Federer in a grand slam final.Hide Caption 3 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2007 \u2013 In 2007, the then 20-year-old Nadal's status as the 'King of Clay' was sealed. Defeat to Federer at the Masters Series in Hamburg ended an 81-match unbeaten streak on clay, which remains a men's Open Era record today. At that year's French Open, Nadal opted for the reverse of 2006's top-bandana combo -- this time with matching trainers to boot.Hide Caption 4 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2008 \u2013 A year later, Nadal opted for a variation on his debut French Option look, this time sporting an all-green combo. Nadal reached world No. 1 for the first time in his career in 2008, helped by his fourth consecutive Roland Garros title -- matching Bjorn Borg's record of consecutive trophies, while also becoming only the seventh man to win a grand slam without dropping a set.Hide Caption 5 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2009 \u2013 Nadal's first dramatic transformation came in 2009. Gone were the sleeveless shirts and three-quarter lengths, in came the sleeves and fluorescent, clashing colors. Perhaps it was the sleeves restricting the powerful arms (or maybe a knee injury), but Nadal suffered the first of only two French Open defeats. Despite a shock fourth-round loss to Robin Soderling, Nadal set a record of 31 consecutive wins at Roland Garros.Hide Caption 6 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2010 \u2013 In 2010, Nadal bounced back from the 2009 disappointment with a daring multicolored number. He went on to exact revenge on Soderling, beating him in the final after the Swede had upset Federer in the quarterfinals. Federer's failure to reach the semis meant Nadal regained the world No. 1 spot, while it was also the second time he won the French Open without dropping a set.Hide Caption 7 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2011 \u2013 The following year, Nadal dialed down the brightness, instead choosing to return to one of his earliest Roland Garros styles. And it worked -- he maintained his No. 1 ranking throughout the clay court season and beat perennial rival Federer in the final.Hide Caption 8 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2012 \u2013 Perhaps in an attempt to gain the upper hand on opponents by blending into the clay, Nadal opted for an orange-ish-red look for the first time at the French Open. It appeared to work, as Nadal dropped just 30 games in the first five rounds, before beating Djokovic in four sets in the final to claim his seventh Roland Garros title and surpass Borg as the tournament's most successful player.Hide Caption 9 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2013 \u2013 The 2013 French Open was the debut of Nadal's latest wardrobe change: the short shorts. In an all-Spanish final, Nadal defeated David Ferrer in straight sets -- although bizarrely dropped from fourth in the world to fifth after his victory.Hide Caption 10 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2014 \u2013 Perhaps a sign of entering into his late 20s, Nadal's colors switched from fluorescent to more mellow tones. Despite being hampered by injuries and suffering surprise defeats early in the clay court season, Nadal grinded out arguably his most impressive Roland Garros victory. Another victory in the final against Djokovic took him to 14 grand slams (level with Pete Sampras) and it was his fifth straight French Open triumph.Hide Caption 11 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2015 \u2013 Nadal's struggle to find form continued into 2015's clay court season, dropping outside of the world's top five for the first time since 2005. Looking like an athletic version of the Cookie Monster, Nadal crashed out of the French Open in the quarterfinals to Djokovic. It ended his 39-match unbeaten run and marked just his second defeat on the Parisian clay.Hide Caption 12 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2016 \u2013 The following year, the shorts got even shorter and the two-tone top returned as Nadal exited the French Open in the third round -- although this time it was a wrist injury that defeated him. Despite the disappointment, there was another milestone for Nadal as he became only the eighth man to reach 200 grand slam wins.Hide Caption 13 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2017 \u2013 Nadal debuted his strong blue look against Benoit Paire in the first round and the King of Clay went on to complete \"'La Decima\" of 10 Roland Garros titles.Hide Caption 14 of 14No sets lostAnd for the third time -- after 2008 and 2010 -- he won the French Open title without conceding a set, dropping a mere 35 games in seven matches. He averaged less than two hours on court. He is not dubbed the 'King of Clay' for no reason. Gustavo Kuerten, the much loved Brazilian who was feted along with other tennis Hall of Famers prior to the finale, insisted last week Nadal could win several more French Opens. If he does so next year, his 11 titles would match what Margaret Court accomplished at the Australian Open in the 1960s and 70s. She is the lone other tennis player to reach double digits at the same major. Certainly Nadal's form suggests he has plenty of good tennis left in him but he'll want those injuries to stay away. Should he continue to pile up victories at Roland Garros, it will indeed be without Uncle Toni. Former French Open winner Carlos Moya -- currently Nadal's co-coach, added last year for a fresh voice -- will be taking on more of the load. All those years ago, it was Toni's decision to turn Nadal from a right-hander -- his dominant hand outside of tennis -- to a lefty. A masterstroke. 10 ...... 10 .......   10 ..... you can say it as much as you want. It's so not normal.  Huge respect for @RafaelNadal .. pleasure to watch\u2014 andyroddick (@andyroddick) June 11, 2017\nThere is no greater challenge in tennis than trying to defeat Nadal in a best-of-five set match on clay, so Wawrinka looked back on his fortnight with fondness once the immediate disappointment faded.\"For sure this score wasn't good, the match wasn't good, but at the end of the day there's a lot of positives to take from the last few weeks,\" said Wawrinka.

Even though I have a game plan, even though I know what I have to do, there is always some hesitation in your mind.\"From time to time I was saying, 'Am I going to go for it?'\"So this is something that is very difficult to control. And if you miss a ball, if you hit a ball short, they will attack you. \"When you play against them, you have to go for your shots and you shouldn't think too much.\"In the first set on Philippe Chatrier court, the Swiss controlled most of the rallies as Nadal opted to sit back and not force matters. He admitted to nerves. Nadal saved the first break point in the third game with a good serve -- the lone break point he faced -- then Wawrinka immediately saved four. But Nadal pulled away to win four straight games from 2-2. It was a steamy day in Paris -- temperatures hovered around 30 degrees Celsius -- a boost to Nadal's heavily spun forehand that can trouble players with one-handed backhands.  He clearly stepped up his game in the second game of the second, adopting a more aggressive stance on the baseline and dictating proceedings. After one rally in which he bullied his foe all over the court, Wawrinka placed a the ball in his mouth in frustration. Simply incredible, Rafa #10 #RG17 #VamosRafa #justdoit\u2014 Roger Federer (@rogerfederer) June 11, 2017\nBlazing forehandNadal's blazing forehand down the line -- clocked at 99 miles per hour -- drew prolonged gasps from the crowd at 4-1. He was now in full flow. Wawrinka knew he had to break Nadal to stay in the second set to have any -- small -- chance of triumphing: Nadal was 11-1 in grand slam finals when taking the opener. But it didn't materialize and Wawrinka flung his racket to the court in disgust when he missed a forehand passing shot with Nadal stranded.

May's co-chiefs of staff, Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, announced their resignations Saturday on the Conservative Home political blog. Timothy conceded in a statement that he had failed to carry out an effective election campaign, while Hill made no mention of her performance.May suffered a humiliating blow as the \"snap election\" Thursday spectacularly backfired, stripping her Conservative Party of its commanding majority in Parliament. She had called the vote three years earlier than required by law, with the aim of sweeping an even greater majority for her party before Brexit talks in nine days to take the country out of the European Union.Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill quit on Saturday in the wake of the vote.May's attempts to form a government with support from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) appear to be taking longer than first thought. On Saturday night, Downing Street issued a statement claiming that a preliminary deal had been reached, but hours later was forced to issue a second statement clarifying that no agreement had been finalized. The Prime Minister is also fending off a mutiny in her own party. Conservative MPs are publicly airing their anger, some calling for her ouster and others demanding radical change in her style of leadership.Read MoreSeveral MPs have said they were angered by key points in the Conservatives' manifesto, the document that outlined the party's agenda.MP says manifesto was 'arsenic'JUST WATCHEDHow an extraordinary UK election unfoldedReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHow an extraordinary UK election unfolded 01:52Nigel Evans was among Conservative MPs to call for Timothy's resignation, and said \"anyone with their fingers\" on the document should resign.\"It was absolute arsenic from beginning to end,\" Evans told CNN.Evans confirmed that some MPs are calling for May's resignation, although he himself is not.But he slammed May's style of governance as tone deaf to her own Cabinet ministers and MPs, whom he said were better in touch with voters on the ground.Theresa May to 'reflect' after disastrous election resultHe said the party's commanding lead in the polls of 20 percentage points at the start of the election period dramatically narrowed after the launch of the Conservatives' manifesto, which he said was \"mean-spirited\" in its call for a cut funding for children's school lunches and to charge the elderly more for their own care.\"The campaign was going well until the manifesto was launched. Of course, the core message was all lost because of the cacophony of noise we were making about social care, and so we were having to fight fires that we created ourselves rather than exposing the Labour Party's insane manifesto.\"Katie Perrior, May's former director of communications, described an atmosphere of toxicity and intimidation by Timothy and Hill.\"The atmosphere would be great if the chiefs of staff were not there and terrible if the chiefs of staff were there,\" she told the BBC's Radio 4.\"We would be able to speak freely if they weren't around, and if they were around, you don't speak.\"Another Conservative MP, Anna Soubry, told the BBC after the results came in that May has to \"obviously consider her position\" and take personal responsibility for the \"dreadful\" election campaign and \"deeply flawed\" manifesto.5 reasons why Theresa May's troubles have only just begunShe also echoed comments made by Evans and Perrior that much of the party had been shut out of the campaign.\"It was a tightly knit group, it was her group that ran this campaign and look where we are, for God's sake,\" Soubry said. Timothy said in his statement that the election result was \"a huge disappointment.\"\"I take responsibility for my part in this election campaign, which was the oversight of our policy program,\" he said.Though he refuted reports he was responsible for the elderly care policy, saying it was \"the subject of many months of work\" among many people.\"I want to place on record my sorrow for the Conservative Members of Parliament who lost their seats, several of whom are close friends.\"Hill described May as an \"excellent Prime Minister\" in her resignation statement. \"I have no doubt at all that Theresa May will continue to serve and work hard as Prime Minister -- and do it brilliantly.\"Backlash over controversial allianceMay is now looking to rule the country with less than 50% of seats in Parliament's House of Commons, and is banking on support from the DUP to be the ally that helps her party push its agenda through Parliament. Contrary to an earlier statement which suggested May had reached a preliminary deal with the DUP, Downing Street said Saturday that such a deal had yet to be finalized. \"The Prime Minister has tonight spoken with the DUP to discuss finalizing a confidence and supply deal when Parliament returns next week,\" the statement said. \"We will welcome any such deal being agreed, as it will provide the stability and certainty the whole country requires as we embark on Brexit and beyond\".The DUP meanwhile said that discussion will continue into next week \"to work on the details and to reach agreement on arrangements for the new Parliament.\"May's courting of DUP has triggered criticism in the media and among members of her party, who have described DUP as anti-abortionist and regressive on LGBTI rights.What the UK election result could mean for BrexitRuth Davidson, a Conservative in Scotland, told the BBC she had words with May over the DUP's record on LGBT rights.\"I asked for a categoric assurance that if any deal or scoping deal was done with the DUP there would be absolutely no rescission of LGBTI rights in the rest of the UK, in Great Britain, and that we would use any influence that we had to advance LGBTI rights in Northern Ireland,\" said the MP, who is a lesbian.\"It's an issue very close to my heart and one that I wanted categoric assurances from the Prime Minister on, and I received [them].\"Pressure is now also coming from the public. A petition on Change.org had more than half a million signatures by Saturday afternoon, calling for May's resignation over her alliance with the DUP. There have been few clues as to how May might shake up her administration, but the Prime Minister, who campaigned under the mantra \"strong and stable,\" announced that she would retain five key Cabinet ministers in their posts.Scathing media responseMay came under fire during the campaign for the controversial policy on the cost of care for the elderly, dubbed the \"dementia tax,\" and for making several U-turns on social care. She was criticized for refusing to take part in a televised leaders' debate and for carefully controlling her campaign activities to keep the public at arm's length.Tomorrow's front page: Coalition of Crackpots #tomorrowsfrontpages https://t.co/REBrvAGMNv pic.twitter.com/vfuZU5yAKv\u2014 Daily Mirror (@DailyMirror) June 9, 2017\nShe was forced to apologize after she refused to acknowledge her party's battering in her initial post-election remarks.The British media has been scathing of May. The Times newspaper ran a front-page story on May's tenuous future as Conservative leader Saturday with the headline \"May stares into the abyss.\"The Daily Mirror tabloid's cover read \"Coalition of Crackpots,\" playing on the term \"Coalition of Chaos\" that May had used to describe the opposition parties. And the Sun tabloid led with \"She's had her chips,\" pointing to a campaign moment of May awkwardly eating fries, while implying she was on the way out.",

Lewis Hamilton claimed his sixth Canadian Grand Prix pole at Saturday's qualifying session. Ferrari's Sebatian Vettel pushed the Briton all the way -- at one point just four one-thousandths of a second separated the pair, before Hamilton found even more speed as the clocked ticked down in the top 10 shootout. \"Montreal been good to me over the years and it's been a battle with Ferrari -- they've been quick all year,\" Hamilton said.Most poles in Formula One 68 - Michael Schumacher 65 - Lewis Hamilton, Ayrton Senna47 - Sebastian Vettel33 - Jim Clark, Alain ProstRead More\"It was a sexy lap. I can't believe it came together so well. The team did a fantastic job. I owe it all to them.\" The celebrations didn't end there for Hamilton who was then presented with a race-worn Senna helmet, donated by the late Brazilian driver's family. HAM: \"I'm shaking.

Ayrton inspired me to be where I am today -- a big thank you to the Senna family.\"The 32-year-old is now just three short of the all-time pole record set by seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher. Hamilton will be gunning for a sixth victory in Canada on Sunday with his Mercedes car seemingly over the troubles that dogged him around the streets of Monaco two weekends ago where he finished seventh. The race around the Principality was dominated by Ferrari, but Vettel, who currently leads Hamilton by 25 points in the F1 Drivers' Championship, will do well to repel what appears to be a resurgent Mercedes team.

The third row of the grid is a lockout for the Red Bull pairing of Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo, with Williams' Felipe Massa finishing seventh and Sergio Perez in eighth for the Force India team. Elsewhere, Fernando Alonso, returning to F1 after his Indy 500 hiatus, finished qualifying down in 12th while Massa's teammate, rookie Lance Stroll had a disappointing qualifying in front of his home crowd and will start Sunday's grand prix down in 17th place.",

        "content": "(CNN)It was an election that no party won. Prime Minister Theresa May saw a Conservative majority in the House of Commons shrink to a minority. Labour remains in the opposition. The European Union is still no wiser as to what the UK's negotiating position will be in the upcoming Brexit talks. And dreams of an independent Scotland from Scottish nationalists have been shattered.  Here's what comes next. 1. 'Hard' Brexit just got harderBritain's Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative Party Theresa May leaves 10 Downing Street en route to Buckingham Palace.Formal talks on the UK leaving the EU are due to start on June 19. Senior EU officials and politicians have said May can postpone the date if she needs to, but with a final deadline for exiting the EU in March 2019, precious negotiating time would be lost if delayed.Indeed, the prospect of a \"hard\" Brexit, by which the UK leaves with no deal, has shrunk with the Conservative majority, as it's a likely \"red line\" for the Democratic Unionist Party, the Northern Irish lawmakers May has turned to for support in Westminster.  Read MoreThe DUP backs the UK leaving the EU, but on the condition its border with EU member the Republic of Ireland, remains \"frictionless.\" This is likely to pose an obstacle to the types of strict border controls advocated by those in the Conservative Party who support a \"hard\" Brexit. A \"soft\" Brexit, by which the UK gets to stay in the single market and EU citizens can remain in the UK, now seems more likely but that will require a great deal of horse-trading.Related: Theresa May to 'reflect' after disastrous election resultThe more the UK delays, the less time it will have available to reach a compromise agreement with the 27 other countries in the EU.Nigel Farage, a member of the European Parliament and the UK's best-known Brexit supporter said May's credibility is now \"fatally damaged in the eyes of the European Union\" and that he expects \"a significant backslide\" on Brexit itself. 2. The DUP, a difficult partner?DUP leader Arlene Foster, with DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds, Emma Little Pengelly DUP south Belfast candidate and Gavin Robinson DUP east Belfast candidate on June 9.The only way May has been able to form a government is to strike a partnership deal with the DUP, a socially conservative party that represents those who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom.The DUP, which increased its number of parliamentary seats from seven to 10,  is in a strong position to drive a hard bargain, but that has already raised alarm bells amongst socially liberal Conservative lawmakers. Read more: The 10 people who can make or break BrexitThe DUP is opposed to both abortion and same-sex marriage. On social welfare, the DUP is opposed to some Conservative policies that would reduce pensions, for example.  3. Will her own party play ball?British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on June 7, 2017 in Solihull.May called the election early with the aim of shoring up support for the Conservatives ahead of the country's crucial Brexit negotiations, but the move has clearly backfired.Pro-EU Member of Parliament Anna Soubry brought May's continued leadership into question in her acceptance speech. Many others have been less vocal, but with 12 fewer Conservative seats in parliament than before the election, you can be sure many are smarting if not seething,   meaning a leadership challenge could soon be on the cards.Already UK bookmakers are slashing the odds of a rival bid, with Boris Johnson once again emerging as a potential front runner.4. Procedures to go throughMay needs to draw up a budget and flesh out the policies of her manifesto.May has already ruled out a major cabinet reshuffle, and most of the senior government members, such as the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, will maintain their posts.But before the Queen can open the new parliament on June 19 -- the same day Brexit talks were meant to start -- May first needs to draw up a budget and flesh out the policies of her manifesto to put in the Queen's speech.It's all a distraction at a pressured time for the Prime Minister.5. The election has created a real oppositionLabour Leader Jeremy Corbyn leaves his home on June 9, 2017 in London, England. One of the main criticisms aimed at the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn before the election campaign was that he did not step up to his role as leader of the opposition.The Labour Party was crippled by in-fighting and defections. With Thursday's election providing 29 new Labour MPs, Corbyn's energetic election campaign has paid off.Opinion: Left-wing populism shook Britain's political mainstreamHaving galvanized the youth, and with strong backing from the party membership, his popularity amongst parliamentary colleagues, both new and old, is set to increase. May has in effect, created an opposition that didn't exist before. ...but she has kept ScotlandFirst Minister and SNP Leader Nicola Sturgeon arrives at the counting hall during the UK Parliamentary Elections at the Emirates Arena on June 9, 2017 in Glasgow, Scotland.If there is any consolation for May and the Conservatives, it is that following Thursday's election, Scotland is not leaving the UK anytime soon.Prior to June 8, the leader of the Scottish National Party, Nicola Sturgeon was pushing hard for a second referendum, after losing the 2014 independence vote. She argued that Brexit, which Scotland largely rejected, changed the scenario to such an extent Scotland should be given a second referendum.In March, Scottish lawmakers voted 69-59 in favor of such a course, putting the SNP on track for a major collision with May, who is against another vote. It looks like Scotland at least, won't be going anywhere soon. CNN political analyst Jane Merrick contributed to this report. Euan McKirdy also contributed from Hong Kong.",

It was also a momentous day for his Mahindra Racing team who hadn't registered a win during its three seasons in the all-electric race series.Di Grassi had sprinted to pole earlier in the day, pipping DS Virgin Racing's Jose Maria Lopez by 1,000th of a second, but could do nothing to repel Rosenqvist as the race progressed.The 25-year-old rookie had started from third but immediately jumped a place as Lopez got a sluggish start.

The result means that di Grassi closes the gap to 22 points on Buemi at the top of the driver standings -- the Swiss now has 132 points to the Brazilian's 110. Rosenqvist's win moves him up to fourth with 65 points, three points behind Buemi's Renault eDams teammate Nico Prost.

Anna Soubry, a Conservative MP, said May would have to consider her position.Record number of women elected to British ParliamentConservative MP Nigel Evans told CNN his party shot itself \"in the head\" with an \"irrelevant\" manifesto, which was peppered with \"arsenic.\"Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the early results showed May had lost her mandate and called for her to resign. \"People have said they have had quite enough of austerity politics,\" he said, repeating his campaign promises to push for better funding for health and education. Labour performed above all expectations at the ballot box, winning 262 seats.\"I think it's pretty clear who won this election,\" Corbyn told reporters.A smiling Jeremy Corbyn arrives at the count center in north London.\"We are ready to do everything we can to put our program into operation; there isn't a parliamentary majority for anybody at the present time, the party that has lost in this election is the Conservative Party, the arguments the Conservative Party put forward in this election have lost. \"I think we need a change.\"DUP partnershipTo retain her role as Prime Minister, May moved quickly announcing her intention to pursue a partnership with the DUP, a small party from Northern Ireland known for pursuing a more socially conservative agenda than the Tories.  While the party backed Britain's exit from the European Union, it has pushed back in the past against a \"hard Brexit.\"Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster says she will speak to Theresa May.Speaking Friday, leader Arlene Foster said the DUP would enter into discussions with the Prime Minister to \"bring stability to our nation at this time of great challenge.\"Rather than an official coalition, the partnership is likely to be on an issue by issue basis.

Eight people were killed and the three attackers were shot dead by police.  London attack: What we know about the victimsLondon Metropolitan Police said the trio's ringleader, Khuram Butt, attempted to rent the large truck online on the morning of June 3 but did not provide payment details when prompted.Butt rented a white Renault van in the evening instead, using a recently activated mobile phone. READ: London lives onRead MoreLarge trucks have been used in other ramming attacks in Europe and have caused higher numbers of casualties. Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel killed 86 people in Nice, France, when he plowed through a large crowd celebrating the national Bastille Day last July. In Berlin, Anis Amri rammed into a Christmas market, killing 12. Butt out on bail at time of attackMet Police confirmed to CNN that Butt was out on bail at the time of the attacks, having been arrested in a low-level fraud offense in October 2016.He wasn't charged and was about to be released from bail because of insufficient evidence, the police said. Who was London attacker Khuram Butt?Two British counter-terrorism sources told CNN that the arrest was part of a drive by British police and the MI5 intelligence agency to take known Islamist extremists \"off the streets\" by going after them for crimes unrelated to terrorism. That drive was initiated two years previously.An official involved in the efforts said the arrests focused on members of the pro-ISIS group al Muhajiroun and likened it to \"going after Al Capone for tax evasion.\"The police and other counter-terrorism agencies have come under scrutiny after it emerged that Butt was under investigation when he carried out the attack.Pink knives and Molotov cocktailsPolice have released images of three pink ceramic kitchen knives found on or near the assailants. The Ernesto brand knives are 12 inches long, and were found with tape wrapped around the handles and leather straps attached to them to keep the weapons on the attackers' wrists.Police are calling on anyone with information about the ceramic knives.\"We've been working round the clock to understand what these men did in the lead-up to the attack but we need to know more about these unusual knives. Where have they come from? Where might the attackers have bought them from?\" the Met's counter-terrorism command chief Dean Haydon said, calling on the public to contact police if they had any information on the weapons.Police also released photos of the van the attackers used to mow down people on the bridge.Three attackers mowed down pedestrians on London Bridge on June 3.Inside, they found 13 apparent Molotov cocktails made from wine bottles and a possible flammable liquid. There also were two blowtorches. They found a number of office chairs and a suitcase, and believe that the attackers had told family they were using the van to move as a cover story.Police said the three men -- Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba -- had driven up and down London Bridge twice before carrying out the attack, in what appears to have been a dry run.Police arrest 3 more in London Bridge attack investigationPolice have conducted a series of raids in connection with the attacks and made 18 arrests. Five people remain in custody and the other 13 have been released.In a raid of an east London apartment rented by Redouane, police found an English-language copy of the Koran opened at a page describing martyrdom and materials that may have been used to make the Molotov cocktails. Police have arrested 19 people in connection with the attack. Six men are still in custody and one has been released on bail.CNN's Mayra Cuevas and Lonzo Cook contributed to this report.",

        "content": "London (CNN)British Prime Minister Theresa May has failed to win a parliamentary majority in the UK election, leaving the country with what's known as a \"hung parliament.\"May's Conservative Party needed to win 326 of 650 seats in the UK parliament to govern with a full majority. Instead, now she's being forced to consider teaming up with a minor party.So what exactly is a hung parliament?The expression comes from the term \"hung jury,\" when jurors cannot decide on a verdict and a retrial is needed.UK General Election LIVE: Turmoil awaits after shock resultsResult plunges UK into chaosHow May's strategy backfired What is a hung parliament?Corbyn is having the best night everWhat the result could mean for BrexitFull results But in UK elections this result does not automatically trigger another election. Instead, the party with the largest number of seats -- in this case, it looks like the Conservatives -- will attempt to form a coalition government with one of the smaller parties. Read MoreThe second-largest party -- which would be Labour -- can also start parallel talks to try to form a coalition of its own in an effort to reach the magic number of 326. If no-one can reach a deal, a party could try form a minority government, but it would struggle to pass laws in parliament.There will be a sense of urgency to the coalition talks to form a new British government because the Brexit clock is ticking: formal negotiations between the British government and the EU are due to start on June 19 -- just 10 days away. Without a stable government in place, it will be impossible to start Brexit talks and they will have to be delayed.If the hung parliament is confirmed, what happens next?If, as looks likely, the Conservatives end up with the largest number of seats, they get to go first in trying to form a government by going into coalition with other parties. But before the talks can start, there will be widespread anger across the Conservative Party that she has thrown away a majority for the sake of an unnecessary early election. So there will be moves against her and MPs could call on her to stand down. However, many Conservatives will not want to appear disunited when there is already uncertainty about what the new government will look like, which could blunt any possible challenge.The first 24 hours: staking a claim for powerPutting aside any demands for May to stand down, the party with the largest number of seats must reach out to other parties to strike a deal  to share power.General election 2017: Latest updatesThis could be undertaken in a formal coalition or an informal arrangement known as confidence and supply, where a smaller party agrees to back the larger partner in crucial votes in return for policies but does not take ministerial seats. If the result is tight, or if the popular vote gives a different winner to the tally of seats, as much will depend on fixing a narrative in the early stages as straightforward math. Which leader can assert authority over the way the results have fallen, and who can stake a claim to form a government? This could see separate statements by May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to the media in the early hours of Friday each declaring they have a moral mandate to lead the country.Over the weekend: getting down to real talksThe last time a UK election resulted in a hung parliament was 2010. The Conservatives were the largest party but the sitting Labour prime minister, Gordon Brown, stayed in Downing Street while backroom negotiations got under way over the Saturday and Sunday following polling day on the Thursday. This is when the real action takes place: the Conservatives, as the largest party, will meet with other parties to see if they can strike a deal. In 2010, that was the Liberal Democrats. But that was when the Lib Dems could have gone either way -- with David Cameron's Conservatives, to whom they were more sympathetic, or Labour. This time, the Lib Dems are more left-wing and are vociferously anti-Brexit, so are more likely to side with Labour. The Conservatives can more realistically hope for the backing of one or both of the unionist parties in Northern Ireland, the DUP and UUP, who are supportive of May's Brexit position. However, between them they currently have just 10 MPs and are predicted to lose some seats, making May's chances of achieving a working majority, even in a coalition, appear slim. Could Labour's Jeremy Corbyn be Prime Minister?It is likely that, while these talks are going on, Labour will hold parallel negotiations with other broadly left-wing parties like the Lib Dems, Greens, the Scottish National Party and the SDLP from Northern Ireland. Britain's main opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn leaves a polling station after casting his vote.Even if Labour have fewer seats than the Conservatives, they have more choice in prospective coalition partners, so could be more likely to form a \"progressive alliance\". The LibDems and SNP, who are both more anti-Brexit than Labour, would demand key concessions from Corbyn on EU membership as conditions for power-sharing. The SNP has said it will not enter a formal coalition with Labour but could support them through confidence and supply.Monday morning: time to decideA make or break situation for May might be reached over the weekend. There is no strict timetable for coalition talks to follow, and in 2010, an agreement was not reached until the following Tuesday, five days on from the election. But if May has not secured a deal with another party by Monday morning, there will be pressure on her to call off the talks, particularly if Labour can show it can form a coalition with other parties to form a working majority and send Corbyn into Downing Street as Prime Minister. Stalemate?If the seats tally is really tight, it's possible that neither of the main parties, Conservatives or Labour, can form a coalition that has an overall majority. At that point, one of the leaders would have to show they could form a minority government that had the support of other parties. Given Brexit talks are due to start on June 19, a weak minority government with no real mandate would undermine Britain's position in negotiations, leaving open the possibility of another election later this year, as happened in the UK in 1974. But this is a scenario wished by almost no one in Westminster.",

        "content": "(CNN)When Theresa May stood on the steps of Downing Street Friday morning to confirm that she will try to lead a minority government, it was significant that she referred to \"the Conservative and Unionist party\" -- the historic name of the party she leads.May said she intends to work with what she called her \"friends and allies\" in Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party to provide \"stability.\"The reality is that this will be far from easy.  DUP leader Arlene Foster, DUP deputy leader and north Belfast candidate Nigel Dodds, Emma Little Pengelly  DUP south Belfast candidate and Gavin Robinson DUP east Belfast candidate celebrate at the Belfast count centre on June 9, 2017 in Belfast. As the results of this extraordinary election were declared, the DUP's Deputy Leader, Nigel Dodds, declared it was \"turning into a great night\" for his party and for the union between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The party increased the number of seats it has in parliament from eight to 10.  More importantly, the DUP now holds the balance of power in government, the difference between May's Conservatives being able to govern, or not.Read MoreAs things stand, it looks as if the two parties will work together under an informal arrangement rather than an official coalition, with the DUP supporting the Conservatives on key votes, such as the budget. DUP opposes same-sex marriageBut even amongst Conservative ranks, there will be some concern about the power and influence the small Northern Irish party could now yield. In the past the DUP has opposed same-sex marriage and blocked any extension of abortion rights.Although the DUP backed Brexit, its leader Arlene Foster has spoken against a \"hard Brexit\" and against a hard border with the Republic of Ireland where people and goods would be subject to checkpoints.Related: Brexit talks face delay after UK election shockBefore polling day, Foster said \"what we want to see is a workable plan to leave the European Union, and that's what the national vote was about -- therefore we need to get on with that. However, we need to do it in a way that respects the specific circumstances of Northern Ireland, and, of course, our shared history and geography with the Republic of Ireland.\" New challenges in Northern IrelandOther possible DUP demands that can be gleaned from their election manifesto include guarantees of increases in pensions and cuts in taxes on tourism and flights.The party also wrote to the Prime Minister last year, seeking assurances of funds from the UK government to replace European Union subsidies after Britain leaves the 28-nation trade block. All these demands could be on the table in the future.Related: Record number of women elected to British ParliamentIt's also worth noting that the UK election comes as the Northern Ireland Assembly -- the semi-autonomous regional government -- itself hangs in suspension following a breakdown of agreement between the biggest parties last January. Talks to end that crisis are due to begin on Monday.Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams waits to be interviewed by a television crew on June 9, 2017 in Belfast.The DUP's Republican rivals in Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein, increased its number of seats from four to seven. However, because they want a united Ireland and don't believe in rule from Westminster, Sinn Fein don't physically take up its seats. Ironically, by virtue of the fact they increased their numbers, Sinn Fein has lowered the amount of seats required for a working majority.The DUP and the Conservatives have been close political friends for a long time, but the reality of a civil partnership, and not a marriage between the two parties means May will now find herself beholden to a group of ten lawmakers in Northern Ireland, as she attempts to lead the country and commence Brexit negotiations without a parliamentary majority.",

Conservatives lost their parliamentary majority, while Labour picked up seats under Corbyn's leadership.Kalmbacher, a Sanders supporter, was among the American political geeks who joined British expats and vacationers at the Churchill Tavern in Midtown Manhattan to watch the UK election results roll in Thursday night.Only a handful had gathered when polls closed at 5 p.m. ET. A slight satellite delay resulted in a Labour supporter sitting in the corner of the bar excitedly breaking the news of a projected hung parliament 10 seconds before it flashed on TV screens showing BBC News. As the workday came to a close, the small crowd grew to more than 100. Once again, politics, not sports, found bars packed.

The couple left the UK before polls opened Thursday morning, but they had cast a vote in advance by mail.Labour supporters who opposed Brexit, the Smiths said they were happy about the exit poll results and even more pleased they had exchanged their sterling for dollars after watching the pound drop following the projection of a hung parliament. \"When (Prime Minister Theresa) May called the (snap) election, it looked like it was going to be a landslide for the Conservatives,\" Deb Smith said, \"but it flipped during the campaign.\"The couple pointed to the recent Manchester and London terror attacks putting May on the defensive over police cuts when she was home secretary. They believe it stopped some people from voting Conservative. The AmericanTexas lawyer Colin Kalmbacher volunteered for Bernie Sanders in last year's Democratic primaries.Sporting a colorful Jeremy Corbyn T-shirt, Kalmbacher didn't have a vote in Thursday's election. The Fort Worth, Texas, lawyer volunteered for the Bernie Sanders campaign in New Hampshire and said he hopes the United States will take note of Labour's performance under Corbyn. \"You don't have to hide who you are, Bernie,\" Kalmbacher said, enjoying a Guinness soon after the release of exit poll results. \"Corbyn and Sanders have a lot in common,\" he added. \"Both are former backbenchers. Both were written off by the establishment. Both were undercut by their own party. Both told they'd do no good in a general election.\"Labour's solid showing -- at least projected by the exit poll -- should show Americans that an anti-establishment candidate on the left can do well in a general election, Kalmbacher said.Other Sanders fans at the Churchill Tavern shared similar sentiments about the UK election, as did his supporters online.The ToryLoud cheers every time a Labour candidate won a seat indicated that Tories were outnumbered in the Churchill Tavern. \"She'll have to resign,\" Rob Mackenzie-Smith, a Conservative who lives in New York, said of the Prime Minister. He voted in Thursday's election by proxy -- his mother casting his ballot back home. \"The EU must be laughing,\" he said. \"This is perfect for them, they don't want us to leave.\"Mackenzie-Smith voted for the UK to remain in the European Union in last year's Brexit referendum. \"I was very torn on Brexit but decided to vote to stay because I knew the chaos it would cause if we left,\" he said.The Tory blamed May's campaigning style for the Conservatives' projected loss of seats. \"Corbyn showed himself to be a likable character in this campaign,\" he said. \"May is smart but not a great campaigner. She's not great on TV and that hurt her.\"An American in London\"It's in my personal interest to be against the Conservatives, they are anti-immigration,\" Bennett Golder, an Atlanta Democrat who has lived in London for six years, told CNN.

        "content": "London (CNN)British Prime Minister Theresa May has pledged to form a government that will provide \"certainty\" and guide the country through Brexit, after voters delivered her party a huge blow at the polls. May, who visited Buckingham Palace to meet with Queen Elizabeth II Friday, said she would work with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which she described as her \"friends and allies\"\n\n\n\nUK Election 2017 results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPromising to move towards a Brexit deal, enabling Britain to exit the European Union, May said the new government would \"be able to work together in the interests of the whole United Kingdom.\"But Brexit talks -- which are due to start in 10 day's time -- could be delayed and the Prime Minister's personal authority undermined by the shock result.In a night of high drama, May's party shed seats to Jeremy Corbyn's Labour, which surpassed expectations, leaving the Conservatives short of a working majority by just eight seats. Read MoreThe result is an embarrassing turn for May who called the election three years earlier than required, to give her side a strong negotiating hand in Brexit negotiations.One of the lead negotiators for the European Union, Guy Verhofstadt, criticized May on Twitter, writing: \"Yet another own goal, after Cameron now May, will make already complex negotiations even more complicated.\"Donald Tusk, president of the European Council,  added: \"We don't when Brexit talks start. We know when they must end.\"'Catastrophic' resultsThe result also prompted criticism of May from within her own ranks as well as from the opposition. READ: General election 2017 -- Live updatesGeorge Osborne, the former finance minister who stepped down at the election, told ITV that the results were \"catastrophic\" for his party. Anna Soubry, a Conservative MP, said May would have to consider her position.Conservative MP Nigel Evans told CNN his party shot itself \"in the head\" with an \"irrelevant\" manifesto, which was peppered with \"arsenic\".Meanwhile, Corbyn said the early results showed May had lost her mandate and called for her to resign. \"People have said they have had quite enough of austerity politics,\" he said, repeating his campaign promises to push for better funding for health and education. May looks to the DUP To pass new legislation, May has turned to the DUP, a small party from Northern Ireland known for pursuing a more socially conservative agenda than the Tories.  Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster says she will speak to Theresa May.While the party backed Britain's exit from the European Union, it has pushed back in the past against a \"hard Brexit\".Speaking Friday, leader Arlene Foster said her party would enter into discussions with the Prime Minister to \"bring stability to our nation at this time of great challenge.\"Rather than an official coalition, the partnership is likely to be on an issue by issue basis. But May is likely to attract criticism for the decision because of the DUP's stance on same-sex marriage and abortion rights. Upsets elsewhereWhile the election brought a good result for the DUP, there were upsets elsewhere in the UK. In Scotland, the Scottish National Party dropped a number of seats, as the Conservative Party made some rare gains.JUST WATCHEDTheresa May: What you need to knowReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTheresa May: What you need to know 01:14The anti-Brexit Liberal Democrat Party did not make its hoped-for inroads. Former leader Nick Clegg, a former Deputy Prime Minister, lost his Sheffield Hallam seat. Tim Farron, the current leader, retained his seat with only a narrow majority.Home Secretary Amber Rudd, one of May's closest allies, barely held onto her seat of Hastings and Rye, after a recount put her just over 300 votes ahead of the Labour candidate.May experienced a gradual slide during the campaign period, in which a wide gap between the Conservatives and Labour narrowed.Predictions of Conservative success became more modest as the party's campaign faltered following a series of missteps.The Prime Minister was criticized for making a number of U-turns on social welfare and she came under fire for a controversial proposal on who should pay for the cost of care for the elderly, a policy that became known as the \"dementia tax.\" Her opponents also took issue with her refusal to take part in a televised debate with other party leaders.Although called as a Brexit election, the campaign was quickly overshadowed by security as two deadly terror attacks, in Manchester and London, struck. The attacks only put May under more scrutiny for national security decisions she made during her tenure as Home Secretary, a role she held for six years in the government of her predecessor, David Cameron.The attacks triggered a heated debate on whether the police are well-enough resourced to deal with terror threats. Police numbers across the UK were cut by 20,000 under May's watch as Home Secretary.CNN's Carol Jordan, Richard A. Greene, Melissa Mahtani and Bryony Jones contributed to this report.",

Theresa May to form new government with help of DUPOn a dramatic night that shook the political establishment to its core and forced Prime Minister Theresa May to place her Conservative Party into a coalition with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, some 207 female lawmakers were elected to the House of Commons.With one seat yet to be declared, that number already surpasses the 196 elected in the 2015 vote and subsequent by-elections.One of the biggest surprises came in Canterbury, Kent, where Rosie Duffield clinched the seat for Labour for the first time since 1918.There was also history made in the constituency of Birmingham Edgbaston, where Preet Kaur Gill became the first Sikh woman to be elected to Parliament.

But as a member of the Irish nationalist Sinn Fein, she did not take up her seat.Instead, Nancy Astor became the first woman to take her seat in the Commons after winning the Plymouth Sutton Constituency by-election in 1919.This year's election took place 104 years to do the day since Emily Davison gave her life to the suffragette cause by jumping in front King George V's horse at Epsom racecourse in 1913.It is thought she was attempting to attach a flag to the horse's bridle calling for women to have the right to vote.",

According to Lord Buckethead's Twitter bio, the mysterious political candidate is a self-described \"intergalactic space lord,\" running to be an independent Member of Parliament.This isn't Lord Buckethead's first foray into politics. The politician -- or someone running under the same monicker -- stood against former PM Margaret Thatcher in 1987. Lord Buckethead ran for parliament again in 1992, this time against Thatcher's successor as PM, John Major.Lord Buckethead's manifesto goals included \"a referendum on whether there should be a second referendum,\" and \"the nationalization of Adele.\"Give Me Back Elmo PartyMay stands alongside the Give Me Back Elmo candidate in Maidenhead.Bobby Smith, a fathers' rights campaigner and founder of the \"Give Me Back Elmo Party,\" ran against May as part of his fight to reform family courts.Before appearing on stage with May, the fluffy red muppet was pictured heckling her at a polling station.

        "content": "(CNN)Don't just look at the results from Britain's polls that had Theresa May's Conservatives coming in at number one ahead of Jeremy Corbyn and Labour -- the real winners and losers are far more interesting. Losers:Theresa May: No mandate for her. The Prime Minister took a gamble by calling an election three years ahead of schedule. She had been hoping to get more popular support for her government as it navigates the country through Brexit. Even though her party won the most seats -- 318 out of 650, with one constituency yet to declare -- it lost ground and will not be able to govern alone. UK Prime Minister Theresa May: Will she stay or go? So May has reached out to Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party for support and will continue to lead the government. \"Disaster\" and \"catastrophe\" are two of the words wafting through the London air. And there are questions about how long May can last. Even if she stays, it'll be tougher for her to get things done.The Conservatives: Bad judgment, again. Thursday's vote was the second of two moves by the Conservatives that spurred unexpected periods of uncertainty and instability. Read MoreThe first occurred last year, when May's predecessor, David Cameron, held the Brexit referendum. Britons were asked whether they wanted to stay or leave in the European Union. To the surprise of almost everyone, nearly 52% of the voters favored leaving the EU. The pound crashed, the Prime Minister quit and the world gasped.Brexit talks face delay after Conservatives' UK election shockBrexit talks: Now that the Tories failed to secure a mandate and a majority in Parliament, the negotiations, scheduled to start on June 19, could be put on hold. The EU and UK have to forge a deal by March 2019. \"We don't know when Brexit talks start,\" tweeted European Council President Donald Tusk on Friday as the election results became clear. \"We know when they must end. Do your best to avoid a 'no deal' as a result of 'no negotiations,'\" he said.We don't know when Brexit talks start. We know when they must end. Do your best to avoid a \"no deal\" as result of \"no negotiations\". #GE2017\u2014 Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) June 9, 2017\nUKIP: A big goose egg for the UK Independence Party -- the nationalist movement that favored an exit from the European Union. It won nary a seat and its party leader, Paul Nuttall, stepped down, saying UKIP needs a new focus. But he also warned that the Brexit movement remains strong and that it will flex its muscles again if the Prime Minister backtracks from her promises on Brexit.The Scottish National Party: Nicola Sturgeon's party won 56 of 59 Scottish seats in the 2015 election but lost ground on Thursday. It ended up with 35 seats and the chances for its wished-for second referendum on Scottish independence took a big hit. Nick Clegg: A surprising defeat for the former leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats. Clegg, who once served as a deputy prime minister, was defeated in Sheffield Hallam by fewer than 1,500 votes.Winners:Jeremy Corbyn and Labour: The lesson is simple. Don't write off Labour. The opposition party had been down in the dumps, with dismal polling and a general disdain for whether leader Jeremy Corbyn was \"prime ministerial.\" Jeremy Corbyn's left-wing populism shook Britain's political mainstreamBut a good chunk of the populace -- including the young and the working class -- showed an appetite for the left-wing policies and world view embodied by Corbyn and his progressive political agenda. His talk of ending Tory austerity plans and getting better and fairer funding for health and education resonated.Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party: This is the Democratic Unionist Party's time in the spotlight. It gained two seats to hit double figures but it has outsize influence now. May called the DUP her \"friends and allies,\" and aims to have an informal partnership with them to govern. The impact the DUP will have is not yet clear. The party is dedicated to an open border with the Republic of Ireland and may demand that be included in Brexit negotiations. It is also opposed to same-sex marriage and any extension of abortion tights.

        "content": "(CNN)UK Prime Minister Theresa May called for snap elections with hopes of increasing her majority  in Parliament. She'd argued that the elections would give her the boost she needed to have a strong hand in negotiations to leave the EU. But now, after losing her majority, the Conservative Party's embarrassing showing has catapulted British politics into the unknown. As May plans to form a minority government propped up with the support of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), the far-reaching implications of this election earthquake are soon to be felt around the world. Here's what to expect:US-UK relationsMay and Trump walk hand-in-hand at the White House on January 27.US President Donald Trump spoke Friday with May \"to offer his warm support regarding the election,\" according to a White House statement. Trump emphasized his commitment to the relationship between the US and UK and \"underscored that he looks forward to working with the Prime Minister on shared goals and interests in the years to come.\"Read MoreThe UK has been one of Trump's few European friends since he took office.May was the first foreign leader to meet Trump at the White House -- the two were photographed holding hands as they walked to a joint press conference during the visit, a physical hint to their close diplomatic ties. She's been heavily criticized by many in the UK for cozying up to the US leader, but has staunchly stood by him, consistently citing a \"special relationship\" that has tied the two nations together since the days of Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt.May's hardline stance on immigration, her questionable record on the environment, and interest in a special trade deal with the US mirrors some of Trump's policies. JUST WATCHEDHave UK voters lost confidence in their PM?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHave UK voters lost confidence in their PM? 03:03When Trump pulled out of the Paris climate deal, May declined to put her name to a letter by other European leaders decrying the decision. In the aftermath of the recent London terror attack, which killed eight and injured 48 others, Trump lashed out at London mayor Sadiq Khan on Twitter, sparking a debate as to whether Trump's state visit invitation should be revoked. May didn't intervene in the much-publicized spat. To many, her silence was seen as weak and further damaged her reputation in the public's eye days before the election.London Mayor Sadiq Khan: Don't 'roll out the red carpet' for TrumpAs long as May stays in office as the right-leaning leader, not much is expected to change between the two leaders' transatlantic alliance.Jeremy Corbyn's left-wing populism shook Britain's political mainstreamIn contrast, the opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, whose party gained at least 29 seats in Parliament, has openly shared his misgivings about the US leader. Last month, he called the Trump administration \"erratic,\" saying that he wouldn't \"pander to it\" under a Labour government. Although a Labour government is not on the cards, a strong footing in Parliament will undoubtedly give voice to a more accepted political push back against Trump -- who has become increasingly unpopular in the UK. BrexitBrexit negotiations have just become a lot more complicated in the UK. Brexit talks between the UK and the European Commission are scheduled to start on June 20 and that timetable should hold, according to EU President Jean-Claude Juncker. On Friday, Juncker said that he hoped that the election result would not have a \"major impact on the negotiations we are desperately waiting for.\" How Theresa May's 'Brexit election' strategy backfiredFor some European leaders, the election result does complicate the situation. EU commissioner G\u00fcnther Oettinger said: \"A weak partner weakens the whole negotiations.\"May's election kerfuffle inspired some Europeans to take an open jab at the British prime minister.In a series of tweets, Siegfried Muresan, leader of the European Parliament's largest party, the EEP said: \"'I will be a bloody difficult woman to Juncker' said May 5 weeks ago... this morning she looks bloody weak. Until yesterday, Theresa May campaigned. Today she needs to start working. She needs to tell British people the truth: #Brexit weakens UK.\"#Brexit negotiations cannot end successfully, as long as they don't even start. UK needs to end campaign mode & start negotiations. #GE2017 https://t.co/5kLQe4p8Gy\u2014 Siegfried Muresan (@SMuresan) June 9, 2017\nThroughout the campaign, May maintained that only she would be able to get the best deal for the British public during Brexit negotiations. However due to her poor showing, May is now forced into an informal alliance with the socially conservative DUP who have campaigned for a \"soft\" Brexit, retaining more of the links to Europe that currently exist.The 10 people who can make or break BrexitThe Middle EastHow May has been working with key actors in the Middle East has been highly criticized by her opponents -- and much of the British public throughout her tenure. During the election campaign, the public's attention turned towards May for her controversial arms deals with Saudi Arabia. She had visited Saudi Arabia as part of a tour of other Gulf Arab countries to promote post-Brexit trade deals. Britain votes: What next for the UK?Dr. Russell Foster, lecturer in European politics at King's College London says that as the UK leaves the EU, it will continue to secure trade deals with the Saudis, even if they are unpopular at home.Foster hypothesizes that May will step down soon, making way for Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson who will pay lip service to the public's concern while continuing to quietly sell weapons to the powerful Middle East actor.\"All governments have been selling the Saudis arms since the 1970s, yet there is an expectation that it will stop. We might see a shift there (with a new prime minister) but I don't think for a moment it would stop - it would simply become a hidden aspect of our trade,\" he said. Dr. Nina Musgrave, assistant director at the Centre for Defence Studies at King's College, told CNN that under May's Conservative-DUP alliance, she doesn't see a big change coming in matters of the Middle East, but pointed to the DUP's support for the Israeli state.\"It is likely that this new government will nurture and possibly even strengthen UK-Israeli relations,\" she said. In opposition, Labour leader Corbyn has long criticized Israel's approval of additional settlements in the West Bank, adding that he would have recognized a Palestinian state if he had become prime minister. Although Corbyn lost the race to Downing Street, Musgrave says that Labour could still have a say in the UK's Middle East foreign policy.\"The surge in Labour seats means that calls for a transformation of Middle East policy will just become stronger and more consistent.\"The CommonwealthOver the last few years, British identity has taken center stage in UK politics, with many Britons fearing that \"British identity is being eroded,\" according to Foster.As the UK exits from the EU, it will also leave the treaty that allows free movement of EU citizens within the bloc. As immigration from European countries drops, an increase of migrants from the Commonwealth could be expected to fill jobs previously held by European migrant workers. Read: \"England is Finished\"Great Britain? How the UK shapes up against the rest of the worldThe new government could make a deal that encourages more immigration from Commonwealth countries -- places that some see as \"somewhat British\" and \"less hostile\" than other nations, according to Foster.\"For the man on the street, an immigrant from South Africa, Jamaica, Australia or another Commonwealth country would be preferable than a man from the Middle East,\" he explained.",

In the early hours of Friday morning, Sturgeon admitted the poor results meant she would need to \"reflect\" on the appetite for a referendum.\n\n\n\nUK Election 2017 results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSturgeon told the BBC that a \"post-Brexit uncertainty\" was a factor in people's voting choices and \"certainly the independence referendum is part of that.\" Read MoreScottish Conservative Party leader Ruth Davidson, euphoric about her party's gains in Scotland, said that IndyRef 2, the colloquial name for a second referendum, was dead in the water.\"I think we have seen the country's reaction in the number of SNP seats falling,\" she told the BBC. \"Indyref 2 is dead.\"Sturgeon: We could be part of 'progressive' coalitionSNP Leader Nicola Sturgeon, holds a final campaign rally in Leith on July 7, 2017 in Edinburgh, Scotland.Sturgeon put a positive spin on the losses -- which saw her party reduced to to just 35 MPs across Scotland -- arguing the SNP was still the third-largest party in parliament and as such would have a role to play.\"Now, we have to wait and see how things shake out. But I've always said -- the SNP would want to be part of a progressive alternative to a Tory government.\"Asked about the party's losses in Scotland, Sturgeon said: \"I'm not going to stand here and say I'm not disappointed the SNP lost seats. But... this is our second best ever result, and we've won the election in Scotland. We got more seats... than all the other parties combined.\"Brexit falloutThe SNP had argued that Scots deserved a do-over of the 2014 independence referendum, which the \"leave\" campaign lost by around 5%. The calls came in the wake of 2015's Brexit referendum, which Scottish voters overwhelmingly rejected, but will be forced to accept as long as they remain part of the UK.The Scottish Parliament gave the green light for a second independence referendum in March, but any vote would need to be ratified by Westminster, and Prime Minister Theresa May has already rejected this timetable. The party made huge gains across Scotland in the 2015 General Election, all but wiping out Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats north of the border; each party retained only one seat each.Sturgeon railed against May's approach to Brexit, arguing that the UK was headed towards a \"bad deal.\" May hit back at Sturgeon for her \"tunnel vision.\"Turning tidesThe gains the Scottish National Party made in the 2015 election \"may be reverting back to Conservative and Labour,\" says @marcusaroberts pic.twitter.com/IyRbfaFo0E\u2014 CNN International (@cnni) June 9, 2017\nSpeaking as the SNP's deputy leader lost his Moray seat to Conservative challenger Douglas Ross, CNN's Nic Robertson said that he had \"noticed some sensitivity with Angus Robertson\" on the campaign trail. \"I can only put that down to how he felt in the run up to the election, what he was hearing on the doorsteps wasn't so pleasing to the ears.\"Speaking to Scottish voters, Robertson said that the message emerging from the country was that the SNP's drive for a second independence referendum has driven voters away from them.\"Perhaps this is one area where Theresa May delivered,\" he said. \"We know when she took over ... one of the things she spoke most passionately about was keeping the union together. Well it appears that calling this snap election at least does dent the SNP's prospects of calling for a second independence referendum... so in that context Theresa May perhaps has delivered... a United Kingdom remaining united.\"",

        "content": "Story highlightsLabour leader started campaign written off by expertsHis far left-wing manifesto has been well received by votersLondon (CNN)If, as the exit poll predicts, the UK election denies Theresa May her majority it is an extraordinary victory for her opponent Jeremy Corbyn.The Labour leader started this campaign with a deficit in the polls of around 20 points, and his chances written off by most experts, political commentators and the press. Even many of his own MPs -- some of whom tried to unseat him last summer -- didn't think he had it in him to be Prime Minister.The result is not yet final and it still looks like May's Conservatives will still have the most seats, meaning they will be able to start talks to form a coalition. But the fact that Corbyn is expected to have robbed May of her overall majority is a significant endorsement from voters for his brand of left-wing, populist politics. The fact that he has defied all expectations and caused a major electoral shock will draw comparisons with Donald Trump's surprise victory. Like the president, the Labour leader is anti-establishment, unconventional and populist. The difference is Corbyn is on the left-wing of the Labour party -- far to the left of its former leader and Prime Minister Tony Blair. It remains unlikely that Corbyn will be Prime Minister, but he has scored a moral victory over his critics in parliament, his own party and the press.Read: Knife edge: UK heading for political chaos?Corbyn at his home in London in last year. Read MoreHis manifesto -- a raft of leftwing policies with renationalization of industry at their core -- has been well received by voters. Stories about Corbyn's past support for the Irish Republican Army and Hamas are failing to inflict serious damage. And in the wake of  the suicide bombing in Manchester and the attack on London Bridge, the Labour leader's perceived weakness on security and counter-terrorism don't seem to have damaged him in the court of public opinion.At the start of the campaign in April, the Prime Minister set down a narrative that the June 8 election was a choice between her \"strong and stable\" leadership that would deliver a successful Brexit, and Corbyn's far-left brand of Labour.Can left-wing populism win the UK election?But as the votes are counted, it is remarkable how Corbyn has managed to change the narrative and turn the election into a competitive fight.This shift has been achieved, say commentators, in part because Corbyn does not behave like an ordinary politician. While other party leaders adapt their policies to the changing times, his views -- including opposition to Britain's independent nuclear deterrent, and in favor of higher taxes on the rich to pay for healthcare and schools -- have not changed in more than 30 years.Read: What election result could mean for BrexitFrom trade unionist to politicianCorbyn was raised in rural Shropshire in central England and was educated at a local grammar school before studying at a North London college, from where he left after one year, failing to finish a degree. After working for a number of trade unions he got his first break in politics at the age of 25 when he was elected to a council seat in Haringey, a borough in north London. Nine years later he became Labour MP for the London seat of Islington North, at the same time Tony Blair entered Parliament. Their career paths could not have been more different: while Blair rose through the Labour Party to become its leader in 1994 and prime minister in 1997, Corbyn remained a backbench MP, rebelling against Blair in hundreds of votes in the House of Commons and most prominently as a vocal critic of the Iraq war. Corbyn (center) marches with demonstrating steelworkers in London in 2016. It was after Labour's second electoral defeat in a row, in 2015, that Corbyn's name was put forward for the leadership contest as a \"token\" leftwinger, but was at first not taken seriously. He went on to win with nearly 60% of the vote.In the same way Bernie Sanders experienced an insurgent tide of popularity from younger voters, 68-year-old Corbyn is most popular among 18-34 year-olds. Read: Britain's young voters are angry, not apathetic'X-factor'The success of Corbyn's anti-establishment pitch -- he saw off a challenge from the party's centrists in 2016 -- may also invite comparisons with the US president. Like Trump, the Labour leader is prone to outbursts of tetchy, erratic and stubborn behavior. \n\n\n\nUK Election 2017 results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy coincidence, Trump and Corbyn have each been married three times. Yet the similarities perhaps end there: Corbyn has the unassuming manner and bearing of a high school science teacher and likes to spend his weekends on his community garden plot, not playing a round of golf in a lavish hotel resort.\"There is a certain freshness about the Corbyn campaign which is attractive to people who are fed up with the staleness and tiredness of political discourse,\" says Tom Baldwin, who was director of communications for the previous Labour leader Ed Miliband at the 2015 election. \"Corbyn himself doesn't look scared in interviews. He doesn't look scared of being found out.\"\"He has a really thick skin and he is very comfortable in it. As such there is an 'x-factor' to him which it would be churlish not to acknowledge.\"Read: 'Mayhem' and 'shock': How UK papers reacted to early election resultsJUST WATCHEDWhat to know about Jeremy CorbynReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhat to know about Jeremy Corbyn 01:16Race to the finishIn the past two weeks, newspapers have highlighted Corbyn's links to the IRA and Hamas, including his appearances at events commemorating both organizations. But voters appear to be unmoved.Baldwin says Corbyn has benefited from an absence of the kind of intense scrutiny normally applied to potential prime ministers because, unlike Miliband in 2015, \"at the start of this campaign everyone thought Corbyn had a cat in hell's chance of winning\". Opponents had not really had a chance to hone their attacks on Corbyn until now, he added.Corbyn stands next to British Prime Minister Theresa May at the annual Remembrance Sunday Service in London last year. But according to Baldwin, the narrowing in the polls is more as a result of failings in the Conservative campaign, including pinning so much on May as a \"strong and stable\" leader, which backfired because she was forced to perform a u-turn over a major policy on funding for elderly care. There has also been little effect in the polls from her position as an authoritarian, security-minded prime minister in the wake of the Manchester and London attacks.\"The Tories have been running a terrible campaign - that is the single most important factor in this election so far,\" says Baldwin. \"They dropped the ball and it is very difficult to turn their line around. They have tried to make this all about her and have managed to tarnish her brand in the course of three weeks.\" Now it is Corbyn, in his refusal to budge from his old fashioned brand of leftwing politics -- and perhaps because expectations of him, as the underdog, were already low -- who now appears to represent stability.While it remains unlikely he will be prime minister, the Labour leader has turned the most predictable election in recent British political history into an unexpectedly dramatic race to the finish.Read: Pound slides on fears of turmoil",

I suspect most people think 'It will never happen to me.'\"Hutchinson describes the current, ultra-swift crop of America's Cup boats as \"definitely pushing the boundaries.\"They feature the most technologically advanced boats in history, clipping the water at speeds of up to 60mph, leading to comparisons with Formula One.'A need for care'As an engineer, Dirk Kramers, the design guru behind Land Rover BAR's entry, admits that his desire to test the laws of physics is counterbalanced by a concern for those on board.\"We're starting to get to speeds where we need to be careful. I'm getting very worried about it if we get that much faster,\" Kramers tells CNN.\"Suddenly, we've got boats moving at the speed of cars -- and try walking on the top of your car at 55mph. It doesn't take a lot to fall off.\"The team's helmsman Ben Ainslie, meanwhile, admits he's prone to the occasional sleepless night worrying about the sailors under his command, along with their families who have temporarily settled with them in Bermuda.One of Ainslie's grinders (effectively, those who power the boat), David \"Freddie\" Carr is in his fourth America's Cup campaign, and has witnessed the seismic shift in speed and technology.Land Rover BAR in America's Cup training during a practice run in Bermuda.\"You're sailing a boat very rapidly with five of your mates in front of you, and you're trying not to crash,\" he says. \"The ramifications if it goes wrong are terrible.\"Jimmy Spithill, who driving Team Oracle USA at the time of the Spence incident, echoed those sentiments.\"Any time anyone goes over the front of one of these boats in any situation, the chances of not getting hit by one of his appendages is slim. It's a real fear,\" he told RedBull.com.\"Every time you see or hear of someone going over the front, it's a real bad feeling. That time of seeing him go over before the thumbs up always takes too long.\"For his part, Spence has gone through the ramifications of his close call, knowing he could have suffered \"a major laceration, head injury or spinal injury.\"The America's Cup argues it has done everything in its power to reduce the risk and improve safety -- both before and after Spence's close call in February --  from routine safety drills, to reenacting underwater emergencies.\"These situations simply can't be a surprise and we need to be prepared for all eventualities,\" Spence says. Land Rover BAR capsizes during a training exercise around the Isle of Wight'Emergency divers on board'In case of emergency, each team assigns two of its members as trained paramedic divers. Land Rover BAR's Ben Williams is doubling up in that role to compliment his primary post as the team's strength and conditioning coach. As a former fireman, he was an obvious choice.\"It's the rules of the competition, to have rescue swimmers,\" he explains, noting that his rescue partner is an experienced diver of 10 years with (Britain's) Royal National Lifeboat Institution.Williams details the medical equipment on his chase boat, which includes wetsuits and scuba equipment, in case anyone gets trapped under water. That precaution was put in place after Simpson's death in 2013.\"And it's needed,\" says Williams. \"There's no two ways about it. It's a dangerous sport with speeds of 50mph with an open cockpit. You're not strapped in, and we have a duty of care to all these athletes.\"Simpson's best friend and former boss at Artemis, Iain Percy, reflected on the potential dangers of elite racing in 2015, shortly after the May 9 anniversary of the tragedy.\"I don't think it will ever leave me,\" Percy told CNN.  \"I lost someone that was close to me.\"Visit CNN.com/sailing for more news and videosPercy described Simpson as \"there every day,\" and in a way he is.

        "content": "Story highlightsKhuram Butt was one of 3,000 people considered an active potential threatPolice say the investigation into Butt had been moved to a lower priority levelLondon (CNN)The London Bridge attack ringleader Khuram Butt was considered a potential threat to British security and was still under active investigation at the time he carried out the deadly assault, UK counter-terrorism sources have told CNN.Butt was still one of 3,000 \"subjects of interest\" considered the most dangerous potential threats in the country and was a figure in one of just 500 active counter-terrorism investigations, the sources said.Police said on Monday that an intense investigation was launched into Butt in 2015 but that it was moved to a lower priority level after there were no indications Butt was considering or plotting an attack. Police typically shift investigations to a lower priority level in such circumstances to free up resources for what they regard as more imminent threats.Who was London attacker Khuram Butt?Eight people were killed when Butt and two other men rammed a vehicle into pedestrians on London Bridge and then went on a stabbing spree at bars and restaurants at nearby Borough Market.\"Khuram Shazad Butt was known to the police and MI5,\" the Metropolitan Police said in a statement on Monday. \"However, there was no intelligence to suggest that this attack was being planned and the investigation had been prioritised accordingly.\"Read MoreThe new developments emerge amid a heated public debate, ahead of Thursday's general election, on whether the British police are sufficiently resourced.  Prime Minister Theresa May has said that the UK security services will launch a review into their handling of the suspects' cases before the attack.Cressida Dick, the commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police Service, said on Monday that she wanted more resources to counter the terror threat. \"In the face of this changing and changed threat, absolutely I will be seeking for London and for policing generally more resourcing,\" she told ITV.Left to right: London attackers Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef ZaghbaSlipping off the radar?It appears that British security services are themselves concerned that they could be losing track of potential threats -- sources said that after the Manchester bombing, security agencies began re-evaluating the risk level of individuals categorized as former subjects of interest. JUST WATCHEDUK goverrnment 'has failed to protect the police' ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHUK goverrnment 'has failed to protect the police'  04:32Counter-terrorism have at times been overwhelmed by the numbers of individuals on the radar, and British officials are now looking at ways to improve their management of risks. One approach under consideration is to create systems for counter-terrorism agencies to share information about former subjects of interest with local police not currently involved in counter-terrorism work. This would take advantage of the general police's greater numbers and their eyes and ears into communities.Around 20,000 individuals who were at some point subjects of interest of British counter-terrorism investigations in the years since 9/11 are no longer under active investigation, but are still considered residual risks. British counter-terrorism police and MI5 have procedures in place for moving individuals from the active risk bucket of investigations into the residual risk bucket.  Westminster attacker Khalid Masood and Manchester attacker Salman Abedi were classified as \"former subjects of interest\" at the time they carried out their assaults and were no longer under active investigation, the sources told CNN. They were among the 20,000 considered residual risks.One counter-terrorism source told CNN Masood was on the periphery of an investigation into an al Qaeda suicide bomb plot thwarted in Birmingham in 2011.The investigation into ButtBritish counter-terrorism services have four tiers of priority when it comes to subjects under active investigation, ranging from P1, the highest priority, to P4, the lowest. Individuals classified P1 are subject to the greatest amount of surveillance and attention by security services. While it was not clear what priority level Butt fell in, the investigation into him involved a \"full package\" of measures, including covert surveillance, counter-terrorism sources told CNN on Tuesday.JUST WATCHEDLondon attacker appeared in Jihadi documentaryReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLondon attacker appeared in Jihadi documentary 01:09Butt was seen as a heavyweight figure in the organization al-Muhajiroun, whose hardline views made him potentially one of the most dangerous extremists in the UK, sources told CNN on Tuesday.Each counter-terrorism investigation is given a name by British authorities. For example the investigation into a 2006 al Qaeda plot targeting transatlantic airliners leaving from Heathrow was called \"Operation Overt.\" The 2011 al Qaeda suicide bomb plot in Birmingham was thwarted by \"Operation Pitsford.\"New details on Manchester investigationThe sources who spoke to CNN also revealed new details about the investigation into the Manchester attack.Authorities have not yet found evidence others in the UK knowingly helped Abedi plan his attack, the sources said.Manchester Police uncover 'significant evidence' in bombingGiven the relative sophistication of the device detonated in the Manchester arena and the fact it contained the high explosive TATP, which is tricky to make, investigators believe Abedi likely received bomb-making training at some point in Libya, and are looking into whether he could have received instruction during a three-week trip he made to Libya shortly before the attack. One key question for investigators is whether he was trained by figures in ISIS or learned how to make TATP while fighting with one of the country's many militias, the sources told CNN. It is currently not thought likely Abedi traveled to Syria, the sources said, though it has not been ruled out. Investigators are examining a number of online purchases made by friends and family of Abedi while he was in Libya. They believe they may have unwittingly helped him obtain some components used in the device after he asked them to make the purchases. A member of the Abedi family in Manchester told CNN that one of these unwitting purchases was a car part from Amazon. Abedi appeared to be laser focused on building the bomb when he returned to the UK, the sources said. The high volatility of TATP -- the quick speed at which it evaporates or sublimes and thus becomes useless as an explosive -- means he almost certainly made the explosive substance in the three days between his return from Libya and the attack, the sources told CNN.

Read MorePolls close at 10 p.m. UK time (5 p.m. ET), with results expected to begin rolling in within an hour or so after voting finishes. What about Brexit? While both the Conservatives and Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, have committed to enacting Brexit, each party has a different vision for how the departure from the EU should happen. The non-Brit's guide to Britain's snap electionA so-called \"hard\" Brexit would see the UK leave the EU's single market, which guarantees the free movement of goods, services and people within the bloc. A \"soft\" Brexit would still mean Britain leaves the EU, but the government would seek to retain access to the single market and allow some degree of free movement. As well as their differences over how to implement Brexit, the two parties also have major disagreements on how to handle the rewriting of a great deal of British law currently set by EU regulations.What happens?Voters in all 650 constituencies across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are choosing their local member of parliament (MP) from the more than 3,300 candidates running throughout the UK. Conservative Party leader Theresa May and husband Philip  voted in Maidenhead, England.In the UK system, the Prime Minister is the leader of the party able to form a government, meaning they need the support of the majority of the House of Commons -- where MPs sit -- or 326 seats. Only two people have a realistic chance of being the next Prime Minister: May, the incumbent, or Labour's Corbyn.Before the election, May had a majority of 12 seats, won in 2015 under Conservative Party leader David Cameron, who stepped down after losing the Brexit vote. Jeremy Corbyn arrives to cast his vote at the Pakeman Primary School polling station in Islington.If she retains or bolsters that majority, she will stay on as Prime Minister (though losing seats could make her position as Conservative Party leader unstable). Failure by any party to win a majority will result in what is a called a hung parliament. Liberal Democrats leader Tim Farron arrives to cast his vote at a polling station at Stonecross Manor Hotel in Kendal, Cumbria.  Could we see another coalition?The UK's first past the post system -- whereby the candidate in each constituency with the most votes, rather than an absolute majority, wins the seat -- means that hung parliaments have traditionally been rare, there have only been two since 1970.The last time there was a coalition government in Britain was in 2010 when David Cameron's Conservative Party worked alongsie Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats.In the past the two largest parties -- Labour and the Conservatives -- dominated British politics. However, in recent years, a breakdown in traditional party loyalties has made everything more unpredictable. In 2010, the Conservatives fell 20 seats short of a majority and were forced into a governing coalition with the Liberal Democrats. That decision was made after negotiations between Labour and the Lib Dems broke down, showing how difficult it can be for two parties to hash out the deal necessary to govern -- something that could be even harder this year. SNP Leader Nicola Sturgeon exits after casting her vote in the general election with her husband Peter Murrel.Of the seven major parties contesting the election, two -- the Conservatives and UKIP -- sit on the political right, the Liberal Democrats sit roughly in the center, and four -- Labour, the Greens, Plaid Cymru, and the Scottish National Party (SNP) -- are on the left.Within the wider left wing grouping however, are two nationalist parties, representing Wales and Scotland respectively. That makes negotiations even more complicated -- the SNP for example are seeking a second Scottish independence referendum, which all UK-wide parties oppose. So if there isn't a clear winner Friday morning, we could be in for a long round of negotiations.",

        "content": "(CNN)The United Kingdom is having something of an identity crisis.Having narrowly voted for Brexit last year, the UK is in the midst of redefining not only its relationship with Europe, but also itself. Then throw into the mix a general election, called just a month and a half ago. The Conservative Party, currently in power under Prime Minister Theresa May, hopes to increase its majority in Parliament. The opposition Labour Party wants to oust them. And the centrist Liberal Democrats have positioned themselves as the anti-Brexit party, hoping to give voters a second chance on their European Union decision.It's a confusing and deeply divisive time for Britons. To help make sense of it all, we asked you to leave us a voicemail telling us your hopes for the UK and its place in the world. Here's what you said. (Some messages have been edited for length and clarity.)\nThe UK should retain its position as a responsible international player. Brexit has put that situation in doubt.\n\nPhillipa\n\n\nPhillipa has worked abroad in developing countries, and says that other nations have a lot of respect for Britain, but Brexit has thrown its status on the world stage into doubt. Calling herself a \"staunch Remainer,\" she hopes for a 'soft Brexit' where the UK doesn't \"draw back from the international community\". Ideally, she'd like \"to see Britain completely turn away from this Brexit model,\" but but believes that won't happen. However, she thinks it's \"absolutely vital that Britain still tries to show a strong face in the world, a moral responsibility,\" and she's hopeful that more young people being engaged with politics and world affairs will change things.\nThe UK could see its relevance diminish.\n\nMatthew\n\n\nRead MoreAn American expat, Matthew moved to London to study international relations. He thinks it will be tough for the UK to strike a good Brexit deal. They'll want to stay in the European single market for economic reasons, he says, but that might mean making concessions like open borders, which many Brexit supporters oppose. Britain is \"kind of pulling out where it had a voice at the table,\" he thinks, and won't have as much sway going forward. \nIn the past, we've led in communication, in science, in leading an industrial revolution; we fought for what's right in two World Wars, and then we lost our way.\n\nGary\n\n\nGary says the UK has \"elected government after government that has ripped everything away from the poor and made the rich richer.\" The UK, he says, should look after all its people: \"I'm fairly comfortable, but my neighbor might not be in the same situation. We need to confront that rather than shutting our front doors. It would be good to stand as an example to the rest of the world.\" He also thinks Britain needs to \"stop following Trump blindly\" and start building a better relationship with Europe ahead of Brexit. \"We are losing a fantastic friendship and trading partner, and ... if we walk away from the negotiating table with no deal, it will do much more harm than good.\" Overall, he says Britain needs to \"stand up for what we stood up for in the past, which is our principles.\"\nWe should be an active participant in international research.\n\nCatherine\n\n\nFor Catherine, much of the UK's future -- and, indeed, the world's future -- depends on research and academics. \"It's important to maximize the improvement that comes about through research and cooperation between different countries,\" says the retired higher education professional. She's concerned that she hasn't heard much about this issue during campaigning, and that it won't be given enough attention in Brexit talks: \"The most dangerous thing about leaving the EU is the loss of academic and research opportunities.\" In this election, she's been debating whether to \"vote practically\" or follow her ideals.\nThe UK's place in the world should be to combat the greed and absence of morality.\n\nMichael\n\n\nMichael has lived in Spain for two years, and sent off a postal ballot after he confirmed he was still able to vote despite moving abroad. He thinks the UK's place in the world \"should be to combat greed and absence of morality, and to curb the rich and powerful dictating terms under which we're forced to live.\" He supports policies that \"concentrate more on the people, not just poor people, but all people in general.\" He also despairs of UK foreign policy, wanting an end to UK intervention in the Middle East, no more arms deals with Saudi Arabia, and greater support for the Palestinian people. It's his hope the UK will \"show the US and the rest of the world that we do not have to kowtow to big business, and [our] citizens can live in peace and harmony.\"\nThe United Kingdom should be the leader of the free world.\n\nFloren\n\n\nFloren is from Mexico, so he can't vote in the election. Still, he has \"deep rooting\" in the UK. His grandfather was British, he's lived in England for five years and he's working on his citizenship. Floren feels British people should be proud of their country's history and accomplishments, and should \"stand tall\" as a world power. \"We need experience and a steady hand,\" he says.\nBritain should be an independent trading nation, based on socialist principles.\n\nAlan\n\n\nAlan thinks \"the whole world could do with a big shakeup, it's all gone pear shaped.\" He says  \"people are getting tired of big business and monopolies running the show,\" while the majority of Britain's wealth is in the hands of \"a small elitist group of the aristocracy.\" Despite doing a business studies degree in his youth, he's now disillusioned with capitalism, and thinks that regardless of who wins the election, \"the same people will be in control. Big global industries are more powerful than governments.\" He's also worried about religious conflict, and our exploitation of the Earth's resources.\nThe UK has a justifiably proud history of independent thinking and wonderful ideas. That tradition is alive beneath the rubble.\n\nMartin\n\n\nMartin describes himself as \"an idealist, a pacifist,\" who \"wants to see a better world.\" He believes politics is too focused on money, and financial concerns are secondary to having a positive attitude toward each other: \"Economic justice follows social justice, not the other way round.\" The UK's national mentality is too influenced by the empire it no longer has, he believes. It needs greater intellectual freedom, and should \"revisit the possibility of doing things for their own sake rather than for money [and] stepping out of the USA's wake\" to make a \"moral contribution\" to the world's issues.",

Nor Saudi Arabia, Bahrain or the UAE.   They've all gone silent about the elephant in the room: How the latest Gulf crisis pitting Qatar against some of its regional neighbors has the potential to derail the 2022 World Cup.Follow @cnnsport\n\nThe current stalemate, escalated by charges of terror funding, is the latest in a long line of obstacles that Qatar has had to negotiate after winning the highly coveted right to stage one of the globe's biggest sporting events -- both in terms of global viewership and financial stakes. \"This cuts to the heart of what Qatar has tried to do for the past 10 years: To use sports as a means of increasing its brand awareness,\" says Kristian Ulrichsen, professor of international studies at the Baker Institute for Public Policy.\"Clearly now its brand awareness is being tarnished by all the accusations.\"Read MoreThe Gulf state won its bid under controversial circumstances seven years ago, and quickly drew attention to questionable employment practices used to build or redevelop a cluster of new stadiums. Rights groups have charged that migrant workers have been abused and exploited, while Qatar has rejected any notion that it is unfit to host the event. That glare has been unrelenting -- especially from non-governmental organizations.READ: Xavi reveals 'dream' to coach BarcelonaREAD: How Sheikh Mansour has transformed not just City but the cityJUST WATCHEDQatar's World Cup ambitionsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHQatar's World Cup ambitions 07:10Out in the coldThe Gulf crisis has the ability to severely compromise the 2022 tournament by way of limiting air space around Qatar, and barring goods to pass through its land border with Saudi Arabia.Ulrichsen says that Qatar's sole land border, a narrow stretch of 37 miles that separates it from Saudi Arabia, could create a delay in building facilities with only five and a half years left before the tournament's November 2022 kickoff. \"A lot of the materials necessary for the construction would not be able to come in,\" he says of the potential of a protracted economic blockade. As things stand, taking off and landing into Qatar during the tournament would be hampered by a lack of available airspace around the country  -- its planes are barred from flying over Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the UAE -- while its national carrier Qatar Airways would be restricted from the use of international airport hubs in those countries.French club Paris Saint-Germain is owned by Qatar Sports Investments.Meanwhile, Qatar is already getting a taste of what being left out in the cold in sporting terms could feel like.Saudi Arabia -- one of nine countries that have cut off diplomatic relations with Qatar -- has canceled an Asian Champions League qualifying match scheduled in Qatar between Saudi club Al Ahli and Iranian club PersepolisThe Saudis have requested that the match be moved to Abu Dhabi, a Saudi Arabian official confirmed. Qatar's sporting ambitions -- it owns French soccer club Paris Saint-Germain, plans to host the 2019 World Championships in athletics, and reportedly spent nearly $200 million on a sponsorship deal with Barcelona -- have been a means for the Gulf state to enter the global stage.READ: And the world's richest club is ...READ: Carli Lloyd finds hope in ManchesterQatar rejects Trump terror allegations as crisis deepensBut that \"soft power\" play has just taken a hard knock, according to James Dorsey, author of \"The Turbulent World of Middle East Soccer.\"\"Saudi Arabia and particularly the United Arab Emirates may want to rekindle the controversy over the Qatari hosting of the World Cup, particularly in regard to labor conditions and the integrity of the Qatari bid,\" Dorsey told CNN's World Sport show.\"That is a controversy that has largely died down, but that the Emiratis and the Saudis may well want to exploit.\"Dorsey says the potential of this giant diplomatic rift -- which appears to involve the US in the form of a series of critical tweets from President Donald Trump on Tuesday -- presents \"a loss of prestige\" to Qatar, especially if the sanctity of its World Cup bid is affected.Middle East freezes out Qatar: What you need to knowThe Saudi General Authority of Sports was contacted by CNN for comment on how the standoff with Qatar will impact the country athletically, but did not respond. State run organizations from the UAE, Egypt, Yemen and the Maldives also didn't respond to CNN's request for comment on the matter.When asked whether it would attend the 2022 World Cup should it qualify, the Bahraini Embassy in London said \"it serves no purpose to respond to hypothetical questions,\" and referred to a statement from its Ministry of Foreign Affairs which includes accusations of Qatari terror funding and an intention to topple the Bahraini government.In a blanket statement, Qatar says the actions of the countries and allegations that it supports terrorism and destabilizes the region are \"unjustified\" and \"baseless,\" while the country has continually denied any ties to terror organizations. Meanwhile Qatar's World Cup organizing committee declined to comment, while FIFA told CNN earlier in the week that that it was \"in regular contact\" with the Qatari organizing committee. FIFA did not address questions on whether the diplomatic breaks would affect the tournament.

They've identified these pressure points where the Qataris do place an incredible amount of value on certain things; one is the World Cup.\"Political instabilityA major priority for the Qataris will be fending off views that it is politically unstable or is associated in any way with acts of terrorism says Ulrichsen.\"It's concerning for the Qataris because the whole bid in 2010 was pitched on the notion that Qatar was the most stable and secure location to have the World Cup in the Middle East,\" he says. \"And that message of stability is now being shredded.\"\"It was always a bit of a gamble in 2010 to predict security and stability 12 years into the future, especially in such a (definitive) way when you have had conflicts on such short notice,\" he says.Visit cnn.com/football for more news and videosINTERACTIVE: Build your Ultimate Football PlayerJUST WATCHEDXavi: I'm open to managing Qatar in 2022ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHXavi: I'm open to managing Qatar in 2022 02:28Ready-made alternativeLast month Qatar officially open the first completed football venue -- the Khalifa stadium.

        "content": "Batley and Spen, England (CNN)Tracy Brabin didn't plan for a career in politics. As a child, performing her own shows in the schoolyard, she dreamed of becoming an actor.After working in the local biscuit factory, she racked up starring roles and screenwriting credits on some of Britain's biggest TV soap operas.Then real-life tragedy struck in her hometown.Brabin's friend, Labour Member of Parliament Jo Cox was murdered -- stabbed and shot to death by a far-right extremist -- outside the library Brabin had used as a child, and which the pair had fought to save from closure. The lawmaker had just finished a public meeting with constituents when the brutal attack happened.Cox's murder, days before the 2016 Brexit referendum, shocked the world. A rising star, the 41-year-old was the first British lawmaker to be killed in office since a Conservative MP was assassinated by an IRA car bomb in 1990.Read MoreTracy Brabin (center, in red dress) with part of her team on the campaign trail. After less than a year as an MP in Westminster, Brabin is fighting for re-election.In the by-election that followed in the northern England constituency of Batley and Spen, Brabin was effectively handed Cox's seat; none of the major political parties fielded candidates, the only people who stood against her were from far-right fringe parties. They were soundly defeated. \"I didn't yearn for a political career, but politics chose me,\" the 56-year-old, mother-of-two says.But seven months after she took her place in Westminster, Brabin is campaigning for re-election, after Prime Minister Theresa May called a snap nationwide vote on June 8. The Batley and Spen seat has been held by Labour since 1997.READ MORE: In Jo Cox's town, an unthinkable crimePolitical awakeningOn a recent Saturday morning, Brabin is campaigning in the town of Batley. As she walks along the street, she greets everyone she passes with a cheery, \"Hello, sweetheart, nice to see you!\"This is Brabin's home, and her love for the place -- and its people, her people -- is clear; representing them, she says, is \"a real privilege.\" People dance to swing music at Batley's Vintage Day. Shop owner Bal Singh planned to vote for the Conservatives, but is having second thoughts. \"I was very impressed with Theresa May, but all those u-turns she does undermine her appearance as a strong leader.\"It's Vintage Day, a highlight of the town's social calendar: A stage and stalls fill the Market Square, and classic cars are lined up in the streets nearby. People in period costumes dance to the swing music filling the air, while others shop for old-fashioned crockery and clothes.Brabin, in a 50s-style rose-colored dress and feathered hat, has just come from the refreshments tent, where she spent time pouring cups of tea and selling cake to visitors.As she hurries to her next appointment, she compliments others on their retro clothes: \"Fab outfit!\" -- and points out the local food bank, used by those struggling to afford grocery bills: \"They handed out 8,000 meals last year, it's not right, is it?\"Brabin says a traumatic event while she was at university sparked her interest in social justice and politics: \"I was attacked by a stranger in the street who tried to rape me,\" she explains. \"It was horrible, I wouldn't wish it on anyone, but it was a defining moment; it made me a feminist.\" Through her involvement in the women's movement, Brabin became more politically aware, campaigning against nuclear weapons and helping to support workers' families during the coal miners' strike of the mid-1980s.A member of the Labour party for decades, she left temporarily in protest at the Iraq War.READ MORE: From steel belt to rust belt, Trump inspires UK voters Change of directionSandra Outhwaite says she plans to vote Labour -- but fears others may make different choices. \"It's a very poor community. People are angry that they've been neglected, so they're going to make a protest.\"It was Jo Cox -- a long-time advocate for more women in parliament -- who suggested Brabin consider a move into politics. \"We were door-knocking in 2015 for her election, and I really enjoyed it,\" Brabin remembers. \"I loved those conversations on the doorstep, and she said 'Tracy, you should think about a career in politics.'\"\"It's something that I brushed to one side because there wasn't a vacancy for the place where I'd like to be the MP.\"Brabin speaks warmly about Cox. \"To see her in action, that was a masterclass in how to be an amazing MP -- she knew everyone, she had time and energy for everyone, she was full of love.\"Tracy Brabin at the unveiling of a new war memorial in the neighboring constituency of Dewsbury. \"Our community understands what it is to lose someone in the line of duty,\" she told the crowd.Cox's death was \"a complete waste,\" she says, adding that what happened means she has to stay fearless.\"Of all the MPs in Westminster, I must be the one who shows no fear, because if I hide away, they win. I have to live and get on with things. They can't win.\"\"What happened to Jo was a lightning bolt, but terror attacks in public places are something that could happen any time.\"In Jo Cox's town: Market stalls, a quiet library and now flowers after an unthinkable crime Indeed, when the Westminster attack happened a couple of months ago, Brabin found herself deluged with messages of concern and support from those she represents.\"It brought everything back (for them) -- that sense of panic and raised security,\" but it also highlighted to her how much support there was for her back home. \"We care about each other.\"Last month, Brabin's main opponent, Conservative Party candidate Ann Myatt, was forced to apologize after telling voters \"We've not yet shot anybody, so that's wonderful\" at a constituency meeting. Myatt, a consultant dermatologist, blamed tiredness for her \"ill-judged\" comments. READ MORE: 'England is finished' -- the view from Britain's most diverse streetRegeneration hopesTaking over from her friend was, Brabin admits, a daunting task: \"Coming in, I had to think -- obviously I'm not Jo -- so what can I bring to this? I have to make my mark in a different way.\"Her strength, she decided, was her showbiz career and the skills and contacts it had equipped her with; she wants to use them to inspire local youngsters to take up careers in the creative arts.She's helping to stage a youth production of Les Miserables -- Cox's favorite musical -- in a disused mill in Batley, and sees many more opportunities for culture to act as \"an engine of regeneration\" in what is, in parts, a deprived community.The non-Brit's guide to Britain's snap electionIn one of her first speeches to parliament, Brabin said Batley and Spen, once a powerhouse of manufacturing, had found itself left behind by globalization, with jobs for life replaced by less secure work.  It's this, Brabin believes, that led a majority here to vote \"Leave\" in the Brexit referendum. Like Cox, Brabin herself supported the remain campaign, but she voted to trigger Article 50 -- the mechanism for the UK to exit the union -- in line with the wishes of her voters.\"The people of Batley and Spen have spoken,\" she says. \"But we didn't vote to lose jobs. We're leaving the EU, but we need to leave with the best deal.\"I always vote Labour,\" says taxi driver Masum Gora. \"I've got a feeling the Conservatives will win though. Jeremy Corbyn's not a Prime Minister. He's got good policies, but he's got no chance.\"READ MORE: Britain's young voters are angry, not apatheticAfter six months in parliament, Brabin was finding her feet, and so was somewhat unsettled to find herself back on the campaign trail again so soon. But she hopes to emerge after the June 8 vote with a clear mandate for the next five years. This time around, \"it's not a sympathy vote, it's not for Jo's sake, it's actually 'Who do we want in parliament? Who's got our back? Tracy.'\"Mostly, though, she's just desperate to get back to work.\"I feel this is the job of my life,\" she says. \"I want to carry on -- there's so much to do!\"",

The bulging biceps, long hair and headband remain, but the Spaniard's sense of style has certainly changed.Hide Caption 1 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2005 \u2013 Nadal went into his first French Open as an inexperienced 18-year-old and emerged a grand slam champion -- beating Roger Federer in the semifinals on his 19th birthday. The 2005 season was the birth of what would go on to be Nadal's classic look: sleeveless top and three-quarter length shorts.Hide Caption 2 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2006 \u2013 By the following year, Nadal had cemented his place among tennis' elite and was developing a fearsome reputation on clay. This time wearing a slightly less garish light blue, Nadal picked up his second consecutive French Open title by becoming the first man to beat Roger Federer in a grand slam final.Hide Caption 3 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2007 \u2013 In 2007, the then 20-year-old Nadal's status as the 'King of Clay' was sealed. Defeat to Federer at the Masters Series in Hamburg ended an 81-match unbeaten streak on clay, which remains a men's Open Era record today. At that year's French Open, Nadal opted for the reverse of 2006's top-bandana combo -- this time with matching trainers to boot.Hide Caption 4 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2008 \u2013 A year later, Nadal opted for a variation on his debut French Option look, this time sporting an all-green combo. Nadal reached world No. 1 for the first time in his career in 2008, helped by his fourth consecutive Roland Garros title -- matching Bjorn Borg's record of consecutive trophies, while also becoming only the seventh man to win a grand slam without dropping a set.Hide Caption 5 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2009 \u2013 Nadal's first dramatic transformation came in 2009. Gone were the sleeveless shirts and three-quarter lengths, in came the sleeves and fluorescent, clashing colors. Perhaps it was the sleeves restricting the powerful arms (or maybe a knee injury), but Nadal suffered the first of only two French Open defeats. Despite a shock fourth-round loss to Robin Soderling, Nadal set a record of 31 consecutive wins at Roland Garros.Hide Caption 6 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2010 \u2013 In 2010, Nadal bounced back from the 2009 disappointment with a daring multicolored number. He went on to exact revenge on Soderling, beating him in the final after the Swede had upset Federer in the quarterfinals. Federer's failure to reach the semis meant Nadal regained the world No. 1 spot, while it was also the second time he won the French Open without dropping a set.Hide Caption 7 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2011 \u2013 The following year, Nadal dialed down the brightness, instead choosing to return to one of his earliest Roland Garros styles. And it worked -- he maintained his No. 1 ranking throughout the clay court season and beat perennial rival Federer in the final.Hide Caption 8 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2012 \u2013 Perhaps in an attempt to gain the upper hand on opponents by blending into the clay, Nadal opted for an orange-ish-red look for the first time at the French Open. It appeared to work, as Nadal dropped just 30 games in the first five rounds, before beating Djokovic in four sets in the final to claim his seventh Roland Garros title and surpass Borg as the tournament's most successful player.Hide Caption 9 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2013 \u2013 The 2013 French Open was the debut of Nadal's latest wardrobe change: the short shorts. In an all-Spanish final, Nadal defeated David Ferrer in straight sets -- although bizarrely dropped from fourth in the world to fifth after his victory.Hide Caption 10 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2014 \u2013 Perhaps a sign of entering into his late 20s, Nadal's colors switched from fluorescent to more mellow tones. Despite being hampered by injuries and suffering surprise defeats early in the clay court season, Nadal grinded out arguably his most impressive Roland Garros victory. Another victory in the final against Djokovic took him to 14 grand slams (level with Pete Sampras) and it was his fifth straight French Open triumph.Hide Caption 11 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2015 \u2013 Nadal's struggle to find form continued into 2015's clay court season, dropping outside of the world's top five for the first time since 2005. Looking like an athletic version of the Cookie Monster, Nadal crashed out of the French Open in the quarterfinals to Djokovic. It ended his 39-match unbeaten run and marked just his second defeat on the Parisian clay.Hide Caption 12 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2016 \u2013 The following year, the shorts got even shorter and the two-tone top returned as Nadal exited the French Open in the third round -- although this time it was a wrist injury that defeated him. Despite the disappointment, there was another milestone for Nadal as he became only the eighth man to reach 200 grand slam wins.Hide Caption 13 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2017 \u2013 Nadal debuted his strong blue look against Benoit Paire in the first round and the King of Clay went on to complete \"'La Decima\" of 10 Roland Garros titles.Hide Caption 14 of 14Fashion iconSince winning Wimbledon in 2004, the Russian has become a fashion icon both on and off the court.Her showstoppers include a stylish black outfit inspired by Audrey Hepburn's \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" dress at the 2006 US Open and a classic blue-and-white outfit inspired by 1920s French tennis star Suzanne Lenglen at Roland Garros in 2008.  \"Sharapova had outfits for all five slams she has missed out on, there is a missing era of Sharapova fashion going on now,\" said Rothenberg.Sharapova poses for a portrait inside the Rome Colosseum.Playing it safe\"Everyone has kind of been safe this year,\" said Bethanie Mattek-Sands, the world No. 1 in doubles who is best known for wearing some of the most memorable creations in recent years, including a tennis ball dress at a pre-Wimbledon party and a cowboy-inspired jacket at Wimbledon.Even Venus Williams played it relatively safe this year in Paris.After sporting perhaps the most Parisian of all tennis outfits when she took to the court of the 2010 French Open with skin toned underwear by her Eleven brand underneath a lacy, Moulin Rouge-like creation, the American opted for a diamond-inspired dress this year.It has been an action-packed #RG17 so far.

Call us and leave a message: http://cnn.com/voicemail Your response could be used on CNN.\n (CNN)Oh snap! The UK is holding a \"snap\" election on Thursday. Wait, you say, didn't the Brits just have an election two years ago? Yes, but the UK and Europe have changed a lot since 2015 (um, Brexit), so voters are headed back to the polls to help Britain forge a new path forward.Here's everything you need to know about this election.READ MORE: The world has lost interest in British politicsWhat the heck is a 'snap' election?Some see the youth vote as the key to the UK election.Read MoreGeneral elections in the United Kingdom are supposed to be held every five years. (The next one was scheduled for 2020.) But an early, or snap, election can be held if at least two-thirds of lawmakers agree to it or if there's a vote of no confidence in the government.Yes, that's a lot different than the rigid election schedule in the US, where it only seems like there's always another election around the corner. Voters will choose lawmakers to fill all 650 seats in the House of Commons, the lower chamber of Britain's Parliament. The political party that wins the most seats controls the legislative agenda and will have a big say in how the UK gets out of the European Union.READ MORE: UK snap election -- what does it mean?Why should you care?JUST WATCHEDWhy you should care about the UK electionReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhy you should care about the UK election 01:43Once again, Brexit. It will change everything about how the country deals with Europe, and by extension, the world. Keep in mind there's almost no chance this election will change Britain's mind about getting out of the European Union. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party -- the two biggest parties in Parliament -- are committed to following the will of the people and seeing Brexit through to the end. But each party has a slightly different vision for how the divorce from the EU should happen. Decisions made on how the UK and the EU deal with each other in the future on issues like trade, immigration, security and finances will ripple throughout Europe and beyond.READ MORE: Snap election is a battle for Britain's futureWho are the major players?Prime Minister Theresa May and Labour Party leader Jeremy CorbynPrime Minister Theresa May and Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn loom large over this vote. May took over as Prime Minster after David Cameron stepped down last year in the shocking aftermath of the Brexit referendum result. She repeatedly said she wasn't going to ask for a snap election, then shocked everybody back in April by doing just that.May and her fellow Conservatives have a smallish majority right now in Parliament, and she'd like to get a bigger one. It would put her in a stronger position to deal with the EU on Brexit.Corbyn and his Labour Party have been sniping with May and the Conservatives over exactly how Britain should leave the EU. They see the election as a chance for them to increase their numbers in Parliament.READ MORE: Theresa May, a British authoritarian?What are the major issues?A man carries an anti-EU sign at a counterprotest  in central London on September 3, 2016.If last year's Brexit referendum was about whether the UK should leave the EU, this snap election is seen as a referendum on how the UK should get out of the EU. And the choice is pretty stark. May and the Conservatives have a vision of a \"hard\" Brexit, meaning the UK makes a clean break from the European Union. Under a \"hard\" Brexit, Brits would leave the EU's single market, which guarantees the free movement of goods, services and people within the bloc. The \"people\" part of that is a biggie, because it would mean the UK would no longer have to allow unlimited migration from EU countries. And if you remember, getting a stronger handle on immigration was one of the driving forces behind the referendum result last year.But Corbyn and the Labour Party want to maintain some ties with the EU. If they won they'd likely pursue a so-called \"soft\" Brexit, meaning the UK would somehow stay connected to the single market, so the free flow of trade and people between Europe and the UK could continue.The economy and healthcare have also dominated the election campaign. READ MORE: Why Brexit has caused a UK identity crisisBut what about the threat of terrorism?Commuters walk past a police officer on London Bridge in London, Monday, June 5. A recent survey revealed terrorism is the second-biggest issue that Britons worry about, after health care. And that was before Saturday's deadly attack in London, which came less than two weeks after the bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester.It's hard to predict how terrorism fears will affect how people vote. But some observers believe they make May more vulnerable because she oversaw cuts to police forces in her previous role as Home Secretary.READ MORE: 'Brexit election' now day of reckoning on securityIs it true this election comes with a song?Well, an unofficial one, of sorts. A new tune by Captain SKA has popped up during this truncated campaign. It's called \"Liar, Liar,\" and it, well, calls May a liar for making a series of policy U-turns since she became Prime Minister. It's one of the most downloaded songs on iTunes and has more than 2 million views on YouTube, but you won't hear it on UK airwaves. British radio stations have to be impartial leading up to elections, so it'll be radio silence for the tune at least through Thursday.READ MORE: Why Theresa May 'liar' song won't get on radioSo what do the experts think will happen?Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn addresses a crowd at a campaign rally on May 16 in Huddersfield.Well, up until about a week ago, political observers thought May and the Conservatives would win a landslide victory. All the polls showed the Conservatives with double-digit leads, which would give her the mandate she wants for those Brexit negotiations. But to everybody's shock, Labour's doing better than expected in some new polls. Some even think there's a chance of a hung Parliament -- meaning that no one party wins a majority of seats and a coalition would have to be formed to run the government.If that happens, May wouldn't have her majority -- the whole reason she called for this thing in the first place. And so everybody would have to sit down and have a serious discussion on how they want the country to leave the EU.A word of caution about this particular prediction, though. The polls weren't exactly perfect before the last UK general election in 2015, and most polls had Brexit failing on the eve of last year's vote. On the US side of the pond, we sure know what that's like.

In a tense second half, the Blues inched further ahead through replacement Ihaia West's penalty. Despite being reduced to 14 men for 10 minutes following replacement Liam Williams' 57th minute yellow card, the tourists did manage to close the gap to two points through Leigh Halfpenny's boot, while a long-range effort from the Welshman gave his side a 16-15 lead with 10 minutes remaining.

The Serbian had just won the French Open, completing the first calendar grand slam in men's singles tennis in 47 years, and was playing with an air of invincibility. But not much has gone right since.  In his Wimbledon title defence, Djokovic suffered a third-round defeat to unseeded American Sam Querrey, and was knocked out of the 2016 Olympics in the first round by a resurgent Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro. By the end of the year, Djokovic had lost his world No. 1 ranking to Andy Murray, ushering a parting of ways with his mentor of three seasons Boris Becker. New gear, new coach, new start.

In May, the 30-year-old dropped longtime coach Marian Vajda along with his trainer and physiotherapist. What Agassi -- an eight-time grand slam winner, and the oldest man ever to hold the world No. 1 ranking at age 33 -- can offer as Djokovic's new coach remains to be seen. \"Understanding him has been my top priority; understanding his processes and how he sees his own game,\" Agassi says.\"One of the first thing I asked him is, 'What do you think makes you so good?'\"The 47-year-old Agassi has never coached on a professional level, and his appointment was announced only eight days before the start of the French Open. \"We are both excited to work together and see where it takes us,\" Djokovic said after his partnership with Agassi was announced. \"It's just us trying to get to know each other in Paris a little bit.\"Obviously, Andre is someone that I have tremendous respect for as a person and as a player. He has been through everything that I'm going through.\"Agassi watches on during a Djokovic training session.Lifestyle challengesAgassi will be able to relate to the change of lifestyle that faces Djokovic, who is expecting a second child with wife Jelena.Both of Agassi's children were born during his playing career, and Becker has hinted that Djokovic's family life was beginning to take precedence over training. \"The last six months have been challenging on many levels,\" Becker told Sky TV shortly after the pair split in December.  \"Naturally he wanted to spend more time with his family.

The Russian, who recently her return from a 15-month drugs ban, has, along with other female players, received criticism for the length and volume of her grunt. Sharapova wasn't given a wild card for the French Open, but has said she is going to play in the Wimbledon qualifiers as she attempts to compete in the season's next grand slam.Hide Caption 2 of 10 Photos: The tennis grunt: A force for good?Alan Jones, a British coach who widely endorses grunting as a way to generate shot power, tells CNN that excessive grunters -- among whom he lists Sharapova and three-time grand slam winner Tracy Austin (pictured) -- aren't \"co-ordinating [shot and grunt] for the right reasons ... once the ball has left, there is no sense of value.\"Hide Caption 3 of 10 Photos: The tennis grunt: A force for good?Eight-time major winner Jimmy Connors, however, balanced the two \"brilliantly,\" says Jones. \"He used to coordinate his power shots to his grunts beautifully.\"Hide Caption 4 of 10 Photos: The tennis grunt: A force for good?Inspired by martial artists and boxers, Jones encouraged Jo Durie, a former British player who reached a career-high of No. 5 in the world rankings, to \"make lots of noise through impact.\"Hide Caption 5 of 10 Photos: The tennis grunt: A force for good?Rafael Nadal is one of the most notorious grunters in the men's game.

Hide Caption 7 of 10 Photos: The tennis grunt: A force for good?Both male and female grunters have been criticized in the past. Amanda Owens, a prominent sport psychologist who has worked with Britain's Davis Cup team, said Argentine Martin Del Potro's grunts hampered Andy Murray when the pair met last year. The Scot \"couldn't hear whether the ball was being called out or not,\" Owens told CNN.

Owens distinguishes between grunting and shrieking: \"There is no reason why it should be screeching,\" she says, referring to Azarenka. \"One can't focus or concentrate ... It's disturbing the game.\" Hide Caption 10 of 10Highly tuned FerrariBecause of Agassi's career arc -- which includes erratic play and tantrums as a young tennis bad boy, a surprising Wimbledon title at the age of 22, a bout of depression and drugs, and finally a redemptive comeback featuring five majors -- he had recently been touted as a potential psychologist and motivator for the likes of Nick Kyrgios.  Though Agassi showed compassion for Kyrgios after his early exit in Australia in January, the American cited a lack of time and family commitment to taking a coaching role. (It is unlikely that the young Aussie reached out to Agassi, however.)French Open 2017: In defense of grunting? But the intrigue of coaching Djokovic, a former world No. 1 and health nut who is still in the prime of his career, was too good an opportunity to pass up. \"He's set a pretty high bar,\" says Agassi of his new pupil. \"It's fair to say that might be the very challenge for me, that everyone sees (Djokovic) as only having down to go. \"It's easy to say that this person is like a highly tuned Ferrari, like what (more) can you do to it?  But it's not quite that simple. \"You got a human mind and a human heart, and you certainly got ridiculous talent. But they do have to come together, and sometimes you need different ways to get to the same (results).\"\"I know what he's done; it's obvious to everybody what he's capable of, but he's got to find new ways to do it,\" he adds.

Sharapova returned to the tour in April after successfully appealing a two-year suspension for taking the previously-allowed drug meldonium in January 2016. Because of her absence on tour, the former world No. 1 has seen her ranking drop to 178. Maria Sharapova: Russian happy to have 'day job back' after doping ban\"Would I have given it to her? Yeah I probably would have,\" Agassi says of the invitation to bypass the qualifying tournament to the French Open's main draw, which Sharapova's ranking did not entitle her to enter at the time of her return.    \"She's meant a lot to this game. Whatever thing she was taking was legal her entire career (until its ban shortly before her failed drug test), and she's paid her dues with that. Redemption is not a horrible thing.

Southwark Bridge and the South Bank, a short distance from Borough Market, felt unusually quiet at Sunday lunchtime.Read MoreThe few tourists milling around paused to look out over the Thames towards the scene of the previous night's attack. Police in yellow high-visibility jackets paced back and forth, offering people directions to avoid the cordoned-off area.Some, though, were defiant.

And she was determined not let the terror incident stop her plans: \"I heard about it but I don't worry about it. I still believe the U.K. Is safer than China. I just wanted to make some memories here.\"Kristina Simons, 47, a teacher from Greenwich, was walking across the mostly-deserted Southwark Bridge on Sunday morning, heading to a yoga class.\"My first thought when I woke up this morning was not to go into the city today,\" she admitted. \"It's hard to verbalize that feeling.\"Simons, who grew up in London, said the city had felt reasonably secure until recently. \"We've had a few safe years when we haven't had to think about it. It is worrying.

Graff, who was visiting London for the weekend, said she'd be happy to head home on Monday.\"Because of the kids, I don't tell them what's going on. I don't want them to be scared. I just tell them that there are many police out keeping people safe.\"After a spate of similar attacks in France, she says this is not a new dilemma: \"I explain the sadness, but I don't want them to be afraid. You need to keep living.\"Ildiko Papp, 49, her husband Alejandro, 58, and daughter Cristina, 16, arrived in London on Friday with a tour group from Hungary. On Sunday their guide was stopped short at the cordon set up outside The Anchor pub, just around the corner from Borough Market.\"We were a bit worried after Manchester, but we thought OK we won't cancel our trip, the same thing won't happen in the same place twice. But this attack has overwritten that rule as well,\" she says. \"We no longer have reference points of what to expect, but that won't stop us.\"\"I've been able to make a couple of people smile but it is a lot quieter,\" said Ian Thom, who makes balloon animals for passersby.Ian Thom, 65, a Scot who has lived in London most of his life, spends his Saturdays and Sundays on the South Bank making balloon animals for passersby. \"I'm part of the ambiance here,\" he said. \"I've been able to make a couple of people smile today but it is a lot quieter -- there should be a lot more people out on a day like today.\"\"It's not going to stop any of us though. I feel annoyed and angry that they've dared to disturb the harmony here, but it's a temporary thing.\"\"We'll just get on with it,\" he insisted, adding: \"We've survived bigger and far worse.\"Street performers, rickshaw drivers, cabbies, and others who make up the fabric of the South Bank echoed Thom, saying that far fewer people were out and about than usual. \"People are walking around the city like zombies,\" said black cab driver Danny Hussey.Hussey, who has worked as a cabbie for 17 years, said he was on Westminster Bridge when another attack unfolded in March.\"It's gone really bad here,\" Hussey said, adding that traffic was down about 70% from an average Sunday.Danny Hussey has worked as a black cab driver for 17 years. He said traffic has dropped recently.Geani Cosdea, a 36-year-old rickshaw driver from Romania, was parked on Westminster Bridge on Sunday afternoon. He said he has also noticed a marked drop in tourists since the March attack.\"Working here every day on the bridge, I can see that since the Westminster attack there are a lot less tourists,\" Cosdea says.But the attack did not deter tourist Daniel Almgren, 43, from Stockholm, Sweden. Almgren was with his 11-year-old daughter Lo at Bank Station on Saturday night when the attack happened.\"We were sort of locked in -- hundreds of people were running around saying that there had been an attack,\" he recalled. \"We rushed onto the last DLR train. It was only at midnight that I got cell service and found out what was going on.\"\"There was just a similar attack in Stockholm, where we live. My wife was actually very near to that attack at a caf\u00e9,\" he said. \"We had a lot of discussions after that and this morning again. I don't want (Lo) to think this is stuff that happens regularly.\"\"This is her first time in London and I had to explain to her that this not regular,\" he added. \"We will try not to let this change our plans and change our mood. The best thing to do is not to change our ways.\"Visitors flood into a performance of Romeo and Juliet at the Globe Theater on London's South Bank.Friends Daniel Leadbitter, 20, and Ellie Harrier, also 20, were among hundreds queuing outside Shakespeare's Globe theater on Sunday afternoon.\"The best thing about London is that it doesn't ever find itself defined by its downfalls,\" said Harrier. \"We acknowledge we are a flawed population and we move on.\"But Leadbitter said it was important not to give in to the terrorists.\"Can't stop yourself from doing things just because of incidents like last night,\" he insisted. \"We're going to see Romeo and Juliet, a play about love.

Call us and leave a message: http://cnn.com/voicemail Your response could be used on CNN.London (CNN)When Theresa May called her \"snap\" general election, three years earlier than required by UK electoral law, it was seen as hers to lose. With her commanding lead in the polls, all the talk was just how crushing May's defeat would be over hapless opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn.So, as Britain embarked on delicate Brexit negotiations, May pitched the race as a choice between her \"strong and stable\" leadership and Corbyn's \"coalition of chaos.\"Now, with days to go until the vote, the picture is very different. The terrorist atrocities in Manchester and London have transformed a humdrum campaign into one of the most extraordinary in recent times -- suspended twice out of respect for the victims, and now entirely reframed through the prism of security.JUST WATCHEDEyewitness to London attack speaks outReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHEyewitness to London attack speaks out 02:09On the face of it, this should be solid ground for the Prime Minister: as Home Secretary, the job she held until last summer, she cast herself as an authoritarian, an image she reinforced on Sunday morning, in the wake of the latest attack, when she sent a warning to extremists that \"enough is enough.\" At a campaign event on Monday, she said voters had to decide \"which leader does Britain trust to keep them safe.\"Read MoreYet both May and Corbyn, the Labour Party leader, face tough questions about their records on security. May is vulnerable because, as Home Secretary for six years, she oversaw cuts to police officer numbers by over 20,000, affecting community policing -- which critics say has depleted the ability to spot extremism flourishing in neighborhoods. During that time, May also watered down control orders, which imposed strict curfews on terror suspects, to a more flexible regime. Speaking at the site of the attack in Borough Market in central London, Britain's most senior police officer Cressida Dick referred to the concerns about police cuts when she said she would be looking for more resources to deal with the threat.What's more, Britain's withdrawal from the European Union, under the terms of the hard Brexit that May has set out, is likely to see the country leave the pan-European intelligence-sharing organization Europol, which could further hamper counter-terrorism efforts.JUST WATCHEDSee British PM's full remarks on terror attackReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSee British PM's full remarks on terror attack 08:00Corbyn seized on May's vulnerability over police numbers on Monday, calling on her to resign. No matter that voters get the chance to kick her out on Thursday anyway, his call made headlines, and May was peppered with awkward questions from the media at her Monday campaign event.Yet Corbyn has weaknesses on of his own: specifically in his past support for the Irish Republican Army, which perpetrated dozens of attacks on Britain, and Hamas. He has also voted in the House of Commons against several counter-terror laws in the wake of 9/11 and the London bombings of July 7 2005. He is also personally against Britain's independent nuclear deterrent, although if elected  his party is committed to keeping it. The Labour leader has previously been equivocal on whether police should be able to shoot to kill terror suspects. In a sign that he wants to appeal to voters concerned about his record on security, Corbyn made clear his support for shoot-to-kill in a speech a day after the weekend attacks in London.The key question now is whether the terror attacks will change people's minds on how they will vote on Thursday. May's clear poll lead, which was as high as 20 points when she called the snap election, began to narrow after she unveiled controversial measures on the costs of elderly care. Despite her claims to be \"strong and stable\", her poll rating did not recover after the Manchester attack two weeks ago, suggesting voters are not overwhelmingly convinced that she is the clear choice to \"keep them safe\". But neither has there been a clear surge for Labour, and Corbyn's personal ratings, while they have improved, still lag behind May's. What is inescapable, is that an election that looked like a walk in the park for May when she called it nearly eight weeks ago now looks like a punishing slog. Whatever the result, May will surely be as happy as anyone when Friday morning arrives.",

        "content": "(CNN)London attack ringleader Khuram Butt was identified as a major potential threat, leading to an investigation that started in 2015, UK counterterrorism sources tell CNN.British police and MI5 began investigating Butt intensively as part of a major drive to dismantle and destabilize al-Muhajiroun, a grouping of extremists in the UK supportive of ISIS, the sources told CNN. Butt was seen as a heavyweight figure in al-Muhajiroun, whose hardline views made him potentially one of the most dangerous extremists in the UK, the sources said Tuesday. The investigation into Butt involved a \"full package\" of investigatory measures, the sources told CNN.What we know about the London Bridge attackersAmong Butt's extremists contacts in the UK was a British al-Muhajiroun figure who helped organize training in Malakand, Pakistan, for some of those involved in a plot to bomb the UK in 2004 with fertilizer bombs and one of the 7/7 London bombers, according to the sources.British counterterrorism officials moved more aggressively to take down al-Muhajiroun in 2014 after British extremists began to flock to Syria to join ISIS's newly declared caliphate. A significant proportion of the British foreign fighters reaching Syria had links to the group, according to the sources.Read MorePolice say Butt, 27, was one of three men who rammed a van into pedestrians on London Bridge before launching a stabbing spree in bars and restaurants at nearby Borough Market on Saturday night. All three were shot dead by police.The assailants killed seven people and wounded 48 others.Worries about an attack on British soilAfter ISIS called for attacks in the West in September 2014, British security services grew increasingly concerned that al-Muhajiroun members who had remained in the UK would carry out terrorist attacks. One of those they were most concerned about was Butt, the sources said. Al-Muhajiroun's roots in the UK date back to the 1990s, when it was founded by a Syrian cleric living in Tottenham named Omar Bakri Mohammed. When Bakri Mohammed was banned from the UK after the 2005 London bombings, Anjem Choudary, a British-Pakistani extremist with legal training, emerged as the group's leader in the UK. In order to evade a series of bans by British authorities, al-Muhajiroun repeatedly changed its name, operating under a variety of guises including Shariah4UK and Muslims against Crusades. Despite openly whipping up support for al Qaeda and then ISIS amongst radical-leaning Muslims on the streets of London, Choudary's knowledge of British law allowed him to tailor his message to stay just on the right side of the law.This made it difficult for British authorities to find grounds to charge him. Choudary's lieutenants, including Butt, were also careful in what they said in public and private.UK police face questions as third London attacker namedThe difficulty in building a case against al-Muhajiroun members was for years intensely frustrating to British counterterrorism officials, who were keenly aware of the effect proselytizers such as Choudary were having on a generation of young British Muslims, the sources told CNN.Up to two-thirds of all terror plots involving UK nationals at home and overseas in the previous two decades had been linked to the group according to the sources, including the 2005 London bombings, the murder of British soldier Lee Rigby in east London in 2013 and a copycat plot in August 2014 to behead another British soldier in the capital. Authorities scoured for any criminal behaviorRealizing a new strategy was necessary and increasingly worried by the growing threat from ISIS, British officials decided to take a zero tolerance approach to al-Muhajiroun. The new maxim was to take al-Muhajiroun members out of circulation by arresting them on whatever grounds could be found to get them off the streets.One official involved in the effort described it as going after Al Capone for tax evasion. British counterrorrism investigators examined known supporters of ISIS to find even the smallest evidence of criminal behavior. These included traffic violations, minor fraud, and petty crime.As part of the new proactive approach, police in London and other parts of the country arrested dozens of al-Muhajiroun members. Search warrants allowed them to search the premises and the computers of individuals British security services believed were potentially dangerous, as a result of information from their network of informants and the monitoring of social media. In August 2015, British police arrested Choudary himself after the preacher slipped up by crossing the line and inciting support for a proscribed terrorist organization -- ISIS -- in lectures which were published online, as well as signing a document pledging allegiance to the group, also posted online. He was given a five-year prison sentence after a trial last year. Mohammed Rahman, another leading figure in the group, was charged and convicted of the same crimes.

British investigators believe Butt was the dominant figure in the plot to attack London Bridge and Borough market, the sources told CNNBritish officials have said there was no intelligence as a result of their investigations into Butt to suggest that he was planning an attack and the investigation had been \"prioritized accordingly.\" British security services had no inkling he was planning to attack on Saturday night, the sources told CNN. Investigators now believe Butt and his two co-conspirators only spent two to three weeks planning the attack, the sources told CNN.The sources also told CNN:-- The reason armed police were so quick to react to the attack was a mobile field unit of armed officers happened to be positioned nearby. -- Investigators now believe Manchester attacker Salman Abedi likely built the bomb he set off at Manchester Arena last month. Investigators believe that given the power and relative sophistication of his device he likely received bombmaking training at some point in Libya. Twenty-two people were killed and dozens more injured after Ariana Grande's concert.-- British authorities are worried more extremists in the UK will try carry out attacks in the next few weeks because of ISIS' calls to surge attacks during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.",

At one point in the documentary, he can be seen helping unfurl a black banner in Regent's Park after a radical preacher promised it would fly one day over 10 Downing Street.

Rumaysah rented out bouncy castles in east London, before traveling to Syria in autumn 2014 after skipping bail. He had been arrested on suspicion of encouraging terrorism and being a member of al-Muhajiroun.Sidhu observed Butt and Rumayah standing together at al-Muhajiroun protests in 2014.

The gym is described as a mixed martial arts gym on its website. Butt told the friend he had stopped attending al-Muhajiroun meetings some time ago. The friend said Butt told him his wife had given birth several months ago.Al-Muhajiroun has been linked to half of all terror plots by British nationals in the United Kingdom and overseas over the last two decades, according to research published in 2015 by Raffaello Pantucci, a terrorism analyst at the Royal United Services Institute. Several followers of the group joined ISIS in Syria including Abu Rumaysah and Abu Rahin Aziz, a Luton, England, resident killed in a US drone strike in Raqqa, Syria, in July 2015.Al-Muhajiroun's longtime UK leader Anjem Choudary was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison in 2016 for calling on Muslims in the United Kingdom to support ISIS. In the years after 9/11 the group operated under a variety of guises including Shariah4UK and Muslims against Crusades. Plots involving the group's followers include an attack on a Tel Aviv nightclub in 2003, an al Qaeda orchestrated plot to bomb the United Kingdom with fertilizer bombs in 2004, a plot to bomb a territorial army center in Luton in 2012 and the murder of British soldier Lee Rigby in east London in 2013. More recently, Brusthom Ziamani, a south London teenager brainwashed by al-Muhajiroun, was convicted in 2015 of plotting to behead a British soldier.The identification of Butt as one of the attackers raised many questions about what British authorities knew about him and when.  Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation, said  that after confronting Anjem Choudary for his support for terrorism near the Houses of Parliament a day after Lee Rigby's killing he was called a \"traitor\" by the future London attacker, Butt. \"Many of us in the British Muslim community have been demanding action against these extremists to no avail.

Within eight minutes of the first emergency phone call, officers shot dead all three suspects in Borough Market, a popular restaurant and bar district nearby. This is what we know about the attackers so far.Khuram Shazad Butt, 27Khuram Shazad ButtRead More-- Butt was a British citizen who was born in Pakistan, London's Metropolitan Police said. Police and MI5 -- the UK's security and counterintelligence agency -- were familiar with him, but there was no intelligence to suggest the weekend attack was being planned, Met Police said.-- Authorities said Butt was from the east London area of Barking. He was working at reception of a local fitness center. -- Butt appeared in a 2016 documentary called \"The Jihadis Next Door,\" which told the story of Abu Rumaysah, the Londoner who has appeared in recent ISIS propaganda.   -- Butt, who also used the name Abdul Zaitun, is believed to have associated with the outlawed radical Islamist group al-Muhajiroun, co-founded by notorious hate preacher Anjem Choudary.-- Al-Muhajiroun has been linked to the radicalization of a number of UK-based terrorists over the years including several of those behind a fertilizer bomb plot thwarted in the UK in 2014. -- CNN's Sandi Sidhu met Butt several years ago while reporting in London. She said that while he would attend meetings, he rarely spoke up and was not at the helm of the group.  -- Al-Muhajiroun has also been linked to Michael Adebolajo, one of the men convicted of slaying British soldier Lee Rigby near a military barracks in southeast London in 2013.

They described him as a quiet family man who kept to himself. -- Barking resident Erica Gasperri said she had reported Butt to police after she saw him teaching local children about Islam and showing them how to pray. -- Other neighbors have told CNN that Butt had joined a mosque nearby after he severed ties with another community following an argument.-- Butt briefly worked for Transport for London, the entity that oversees the city's public transport system. He was a trainee customer services assistant with London Underground for less than six months, before leaving in October, according to a Transport for London spokesperson.Rachid Redouane, 30Rachid Redouane-- Redouane also used the name Rachid Elkhdar-- He had claimed to be Moroccan and Libyan, Met Police said. -- Like Butt, Redouane lived in the east London area of Barking, police said. -- Unlike Butt, Redouane was not previously known to authorities. Youssef Zaghba, 22-- Like the other two perpetrators, Zaghba lived in east London, Met Police said.-- He is believed to be an Italian national of Moroccan descent and was not a subject of police or intelligence interest, police added.--  Italian police tell CNN Zaghba became a person of interest after he was stopped at Bologna Airport in March 2016 on suspicion of attempting to travel to Syria. Zaghba -- traveling on an Italian passport -- had tried to board a flight bound for Istanbul. Police also found extremist material on his cellphone. He was stopped from departing Italy but there was insufficient evidence to arrest him so authorities filed a report and placed on a watchlist.What we don't knowInvestigators work the scene along Borough High Street on Monday. -- The Ireland connection. A source briefed by an Irish counterterrorism official told CNN that one of the London attackers had a connection to Ireland after state media reports that an Irish ID card was found on the body of one of the London attackers. But it's not clear which attacker may have had the Irish ID. Irish authorities are assisting the Metropolitan Police in their investigation but refused to comment further.-- What could have been done to prevent this attack. Questions are being leveled at UK security and intelligence services about the possible lack of response or action given that at least one attacker -- Butt -- was well-known to authorities due to his links to al-Muhajiroun and reports of his radicalization. Authorities had investigated Butt in 2015 but there were no indications of an imminent attack and the probe was downgraded. -- How these men knew each other. -- Whether others are involved. Raids continue in east London and Pakistan on Tuesday, with detectives arresting a man at an address in Barking. Twelve others arrested after the attack have since been released without charge, police said.-- What their movements were before the attack. -- How they were radicalized. In the attack's aftermath, British Prime Minister May identified the Internet as a breeding ground of extremism. Whether the web actually played a role in the attackers' radicalization is still unknown. CNN's Carol Jordan, Melissa Bell, Paul Cruikshank and Sebastian Shukla contributed to this report.",

You will not win,\" Khan said.A hush descended over the crowd -- couples holding hands, young families, teenagers in tattered jeans, pensioners holding bouquets, and a Muslim group that had traveled by train from their mosque in north London to be at the vigil.Read MoreHere are some of their voices: HannahHannah, wrapped in her friend's arms, wiped away tears as the rain poured down.\"The attack was a little too close to home,\" she said after placing flowers in the growing pile. Her brother-in-law was working at the Wheatsheaf in Borough Market when attackers wielding knives stormed the pub. He was stabbed twice, once in his back and once in his hip.

I wanted to come and show my support and pay my respects. To commemorate in any way I can,\" Hassanali said.Many from his mosque -- women in colorful headscarves and men in golden caps -- carried signs that read: \"You are in our hearts and prayers.\"\"London houses people from all walks of life, all colors, all backgrounds, that's what's great about this city,\" Hassanali added.Tom Thornton-SmithTom Thornton-Smith, 23, whose office is in the Gherkin skyscraper, was among commuters streaming across the newly reopened London Bridge this morning.\"People were a lot quieter in the office today. Their minds were elsewhere,\" said Thornton-Smith (in jacket, above). \"My mind was in shambles...thoughts everywhere.\"He left early to collect his thoughts and found himself at the vigil.\"I'm a very patriotic British person,\" Thornton-Smith said. \"You need to show support after something like this...with all races, all faces, to fight off the evil in the world.\"Fola DawoduFola Dawodu, 51, said that Saturday was one of the worst nights of her life.\"My son told me he was going to be out in London Bridge watching football.

Not everyone was as lucky as me.\"Dawodu, who comes from a Muslim background, says that she's wary of how attacks like this color people's perception of her faith.\"I still go to the mosque, I still pray, but I worry how it reflects on Muslims in our community. It's creating a bad name for us,\" she added.Eliza Holmes, Jess Tunks, Lauren Mayes \"As Londoners, people who have grown up here, we felt it was important to come tonight,\" Lauren Mayes, a 15-year-old from Bethnal Green in east London, said.\"I take a train every weekend to my dad's place that goes through London Bridge.

Zaghba was stopped at the Bologna airport by Italian airport police in March 2016 as he was trying to board a plane bound for Istanbul. Police found what they described as extremist material on his cellphone.They weren't able to arrest Zaghba, who was traveling on an Italian passport, because having extremist material on a phone isn't against the law in Italy. London attackers Left to right: Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane, Youssef ZaghbaItalian media reported that officials suspected he was bound for Syria and that Italian authorities had alerted their British counterparts about his movements.Police say Zaghba, 22, was one of three men who rammed a van into pedestrians on London Bridge before launching a stabbing spree in bars and restaurants at nearby Borough Market on Saturday night. At least seven people were killed and dozens were injured.  The three terrorists were shot dead by police.Read MoreZaghba's reported Syria travel plans raise further questions about whether British authorities could have done more to prevent the attack. London's Metropolitan Police Service said Zaghba was not a \"person of interest\" before the attack.Earlier, London police admitted that one of the other two attackers, Khuram Shazad Butt, was on their radar as a member of the outlawed radical Islamist group al-Muhajiroun, co-founded by notorious hate preacher Anjem Choudary. British police and MI5 began investigating Butt intensively in 2015 as part of a major drive to dismantle and destabilize al-Muhajiroun, the sources told CNN. Butt also appeared in a 2016 television documentary called \"The Jihadis Next Door.\"A woman and child lay flowers near London Bridge on Monday to remember the victims of the attack.Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said an investigation into Butt had been downgraded as there was no evidence he posed an imminent threat. The other member of the trio, Rachid Redouane, a 30-year-old who had claimed to be Moroccan and Libyan, was not known to intelligence services. Irish police arrest man after London Bridge attackPolice in Ireland on Tuesday arrested a man as they pursued a strand of the investigation into the weekend attack, they told CNN. Authorities said the man was not arrested in direct connection with the attack, and was being held at Wexford police station in the southeast of Ireland. Irish police arrested and released another man in Limerick on Monday.Appeal for help finding potential victimOn Tuesday, London police appealed for the public's help in finding French national Xavier Thomas, 45, who has been missing since Saturday's attack. Metropolitan Police said in a statement that Thomas was in town for the weekend with his girlfriend.According to witnesses, it's possible Thomas -- whose girlfriend was seriously injured -- was struck by the van and thrown into the River Thames. Police ask any other witnesses who were on the bridge or who have seen Thomas to contact them.  Attacker slips through the netForeign Secretary Boris Johnson said that the country's intelligence agencies had questions to answer. He told the BBC: \"People are going to look at the front pages today and they're going to say, 'How on earth could we have let this guy or possibly more through the net?'\"Attacker Khuram Butt appeared several times in a 2016 Channel 4 documentary 'The Jihadis Next Door.'Just two days before the UK election, Prime Minister Theresa May has faced a barrage of criticism for cutting 20,000 officers from police forces in her time as home secretary. What we know about the London Bridge attackersA Met Police spokesperson told CNN that an investigation into Butt started in the summer of 2015, during which police received a call to the anti-terror hotline. The probe continued but was moved into \"the lower echelons of investigations.\"\"Looking back over the information we had at the time, so far, there is nothing to show that poor decisions were made. We will probably discover communications during that period that we couldn't access that would have change the situation,\" the spokesperson said.Raids in London and PakistanRaids continued in east London on Tuesday, and detectives arrested a man at an address in Barking. Twelve others arrested after the attack have been released without charge, police said.The investigation appears to have reached as far as Pakistan, where law enforcement agencies raided a restaurant and home overnight belonging to a man they believe is a relative of Butt.

Cresting the hill on the Mugello straight his bike's fearsome power almost got away from him, both wheels writhing violently on the tarmac as the rider grappled to decelerate from 220 mph to the 50 mph needed to safely negotiate the corner. In a heart-stopping moment the Italian left the saddle but somehow managed to regain control. Mugello is Rossi country, but an Italian winning on an Italian bike perhaps trumped even the joy of a win for the fans' favorite. The popular Ducati rider crossed the line to a ferocious roar from the crowd. It was a bad day at the office for Repsol Honda, with reigning world champion Marc Marquez nursing his bike into sixth place -- points that may be crucial at the end of the season -- while his teammate Dani Pedrosa lost the front end of his bike, sweeping both him and LCR Honda rider Cal Crutchlow into the gravel.

He also admitted he was unaware of Vinales' Yamaha stalking him at the end. \"Until the last brake I couldn't know if Maverick was there, I couldn't hear, so I didn't know, so I braked quite inside, but when I opened the throttle on exit, I say nobody can overtake me.

We have also provided funding for the increase of the number of armed police officers,\" she said at a campaign event.Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, called on May to resign over the issue, saying earlier that \"you cannot protect the public on the cheap,\" and promising to recruit another 10,000 police officers if he is elected into power.Commuters walk across London Bridge on Monday after it partially reopened.Victim identifiedOne of the victims in Saturday's attack was identified as Chrissy Archibald, a Canadian who had moved to Europe to be with her fiance.London terror attack victim Chrissy Archibald.Another 36 men and women are hospitalized, 18 of whom are in a critical condition, according to NHS England.A memorial was held Monday evening in the capital's Potters Field Park, as the city continues to digest its second attack in two months.London Mayor Sadiq Khan said Monday the actions of the attackers were perverse and poisonous, adding that they had no place in Islam. \"The acts of these three men on Saturday night was cowardly, was evil and I'm angry and furious that these three men are using to justify their actions the faith that I belong to,\" he said.

It has been brought to our attention that some years ago after interrupting a Friday sermon he was asked to leave the mosque,\" the statement said.Butt, who also used the name Abdul Zaitun, is believed to have associated with the outlawed radical Islamist group al-Muhajiroun, co-founded by notorious hate preacher Anjem Choudary. Al-Muhajiroun has been linked to Michael Adebolajo, one of the men convicted of slaying British soldier Lee Rigby near a military barracks in southeast London in 2013. Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation, said Butt verbally assaulted him the day after Rigby's death.\"Butt called me a 'Murtad,' which means traitor in Arabic, and accused me of being a government stooge when I confronted Anjem (Choudary) about him supporting terrorism and my public campaign against Lee Rigby's murder,\" Shafiq said in a statement Monday.   Shafiq said police arrived, and Choudary, Butt and two other men were escorted away. \"It is clear that Anjem (Choudary) and his band of terrorist sympathizers were known to the police for many years,\" Shafiq said. He added: \"I am not surprised that Khuram Butt carried out the terrorist attack and there are serious questions for the authorities.\"Neighbor saw attacker teaching children to prayPolice said they seized a huge amount of forensic material in two early morning raids in east London on Monday, as part of their efforts to determine if the three men who carried out Saturday's attack were part of a wider network.Armed police stand guard in front of floral tributes on Southwark Street near the scene of the attack.

All those arrested were detained under Britain's Terrorism Act, Rowley said. One of those arrested, a 55-year-old man, was released without having to post bond, Rowley said. Eleven of the 12 people -- five men and six women, ranging in age from 19 to 60 -- were arrested at one complex in Barking. Ikenna Chigbo, in an interview with Britain's Independent Television News, described one of those arrested in the Barking raids as a nice guy who regularly invited neighbors to barbecues and played football and table tennis with them. \"Yesterday -- I'm actually in the process of moving home at the moment -- I hired a van moving some bits. He came to me. He was a little bit overnice,\" Chigbo told the station. \"He said to me, 'Where can I get a van like that?'

At least one pedestrian is thought to have jumped into the Thames to escape being hit. The suspects are then believed to have jumped from the van and proceeded on foot toward the nearby area of Borough Market, one of the capital's most popular nightlife spots. \"Borough Market is in the heart of a strong, diverse and creative community, a community that supports each other and will pull together to show solidarity in the face of this callous attack, \" Donald Hyslop, chairman of the Borough Market trustees, said in a statement.

His friend applied a tourniquet, she said, explaining she'd like to find the two police officers who helped stem his bleeding and transported him to the hospital.\"Two police officers remained in the back with him, and they had him lined across them and they placed pressure on the wounds and I'm trying to find those police officers now to say thank you,\" she told CNN.Police officers and members of the emergency services attend to a person injured in an apparent terror attack on London Bridge.French and Australian nationals have been confirmed by their respective governments as among those caught up in the attack.

The suspects are then believed to have jumped out the van and proceeded on foot to nearby Borough Market, a popular nightlife spot, where witnesses said they produced knives and slashed indiscriminately at customers in restaurants and bars.At least 48 people were taken to hospitals, the London Ambulance Service tweeted. Key questions remain, including whether the attackers had support or were part of a larger network, and whether the attacks were coordinated.Read MoreHere's what we know.First incident: London BridgeThe van entered the bridge at 9:58 p.m. local time (4:58 pm ET), Metropolitan Police said Sunday.Witness Mark Roberts said he saw a van speeding across the bridge and then suddenly swerve, bounce off the pavement and hit several pedestrians. He said he heard what sounded like gunfire five to 10 minutes later.At 10.08 p.m., police officers responded to reports of a vehicle colliding with pedestrians on London Bridge.Another witness, Brad Myers, said heard a \"boom\" behind him, which he thinks was the sound of a car hitting the guardrails or other vehicles. He said he saw someone jump into the water to avoid being hit.The first ambulance team arrived within six minutes, according to the London Ambulance Service.Second incident: Borough MarketAs emergency services rushed to respond, reports came in of multiple stabbings at Borough Market, which was teeming with people on a Saturday night.Witness Elsbeth Smedley told CNN that a man ran into Elliot's, a cafe, and stabbed two people before running out.Jack Applebee, a local restaurant owner, said people were running down the street and he heard a female shout, \"They're stabbing everyone.\" About five minutes later, as he and diners took shelter in the restaurant, he heard 10 to 15 gunshots. Police escorted them out 30 minutes later. Police called both events \"terrorist incidents\" at 12:25 a.m. Sunday, London time.     Guy's Hospital, near London Bridge, was placed on lockdown \"to keep patients, relatives and staff safe,\" it said in a statement.The victimsAt 4 a.m., police said six people were killed.

But the main parties suspended campaigning Sunday.The threat level remains at \"severe,\" one step below the highest level, \"critical.\"Khan, London's mayor, praised the quick police response and asked Londoners to remain calm and vigilant. He said that \"Over the next few days, Londoners and visitors will be seeing an increased police presence.\"Large areas around London Bridge and Borough Market remain cordoned off.

At least seven people were killed and 48 others injured, police said. The three attackers were shot dead by police.Here's how the incident unfolded:       LONDON BRIDGEPeople are led away from  the scene near London Bridge.The van entered London Bridge at 9:58 p.m. (4:58 p.m. ET).At 10:08 p.m London Metropolitan officers responded to reports of a vehicle hitting pedestrians on London Bridge. Witness Mark Roberts said he saw a van speed across London Bridge toward the underground station before it suddenly swerved, bounced off the pavement and hit several pedestrians. What sounded like gunfire rang out five to 10 minutes later, he said. Brad Meyers had just left London Bridge when he heard a \"boom\" behind him, which he thought was a car hitting the guardrails or other vehicles. He said he saw someone jump into the water in fear.  Multiple ambulances rushed to the scene, with the first team arriving within six minutes, according to the London Ambulance Service. British Prime Minister Theresa May called the attack a \"potential act of terrorism,\" and plans to chair a government emergency meeting Sunday.Police said the assailants were wearing what looked like explosive vests, which were later found to be fake. Read More BOROUGH MARKETPolice patrol the streets after the attack.As emergency services sped toward London Bridge, reports came in of multiple stabbings nearby, in the area around Borough Market, a popular gourmet food market surrounded by fashionable bars and restaurants.Elsbeth Smedly said a man ran into Elliot's Cafe in Borough Market and stabbed two people before rushing out. Local restaurant owner Jack Applebee said he saw people running down the street and heard a female voice shout \"they're stabbing everyone.\" The man stabbed a waitress hiding behind a partition, Smedley said. \"Everyone ran to the back of the restaurant and crouched down, trying to hide themselves from view. He stabbed her in the neck. He stabbed another man in the back, and then he ran out of the restaurant.\"     Applebee turned and saw three men wearing belts or vests with packets around the belly. As they dived under tables, he said, they heard 10 to 15 gunshots. Police stormed in and helped escort people out.AFTERMATHPolice announced the two incidents at London Bridge and Borough Market were \"terrorist incidents\" and warned people to avoid the area while emergency vehicles responded to the attacks.Giving a fuller account on Sunday, police said three men leapt out of the van at London Bridge, brandishing knives and ran towards Borough Market, clarifying that the two locations were part of the same attack.London Mayor Sadiq Khan said some of the 48 people hospitalized in the incident were in critical condition.French President Emmanuel Macron said French citizens were among the casualties, but did not provide specifics.Police said three suspects were shot at the scene within eight minutes of the first emergency call being received. Investigations will determine whether they had support or were part of a larger network. As they responded to the incident, police were called to a third potential \"incident\" in Vauxhall, three miles away. Authorities later confirmed it was not related.CNN's Hilary McGann and Duarte Mendonca contributed to this report.",

After Manchester, campaigning in the election was suspended for three days before returning, at first subdued and then with the full rough and tumble of party-political point-scoring. While Britain still mourned for those killed and injured in Manchester, life was going on. With Theresa May rushing back to Downing Street to chair a top-level security meeting, Cobra, in the middle of the night, campaigning will surely be suspended again, at least for a day -- although it is hard to imagine the election being delayed or suspended.But, with seven victims and three attackers dead, and 48 people taken to the hospital, these are questions for another day.

        "content": "London (CNN)\"Enough is enough.\" This was the uncompromising message from Theresa May on Sunday morning as Britain woke up to its third terrorist attack in as many months.This was a day that was supposed to be marked by defiance and unity in the shape of Ariana Grande's \"One Love Manchester\" concert, taking place tonight in aid of the victims of the suicide bombing a fortnight ago. Instead, the nation is coming to terms with another attack on a soft target, this time in central London, which has killed seven and injured dozens more.London terror attack: Theresa May vows to battle 'Islamist extremism'The Prime Minister's statement after Manchester had been resolute: an appeal for life to continue as normal after a short pause to mourn the dead. Yet this time, standing in the same spot at the lectern in Downing Street less than a fortnight later, there was a significant, dramatic step change in tone. Even though the death toll is smaller than Manchester, her message was more serious and uncompromising. \"There is, to be frank, far too much tolerance of extremism in our country,\" she said. \"It is time to say enough is enough.\"Read MoreA tough messageA woman reacts after asking a Police officer to lay flowers near London Bridge.Her tough message was delivered against the backdrop of a general election, which will go ahead this Thursday, despite the campaign now being marred by two terror attacks -- unprecedented in modern British politics. Some of her political opponents will claim that she has ramped up the authoritarian rhetoric to win back votes after her lead in the opinion polls has slipped against Labour and its leader, Jeremy Corbyn. Even before Manchester, May had portrayed Corbyn as weak on security and counter-terrorism, but that pitch was amplified by the Prime Minister in the days after the concert bombing. With just four days left until polling day, it is difficult to see how she can accuse the Labour leader of being soft on terrorism without crossing the line into bad taste -- but expect one of her senior Conservative ministers to do so instead.Jeremy Corbyn: An anti-establishment underdog who's got the 'X Factor'Yet regardless of the election, May's statement on Sunday revealed her true authoritarian colors -- an instinct she has played down as she has tried to appeal to all wings of her Conservative Party as Prime Minister. Before becoming PM last year, May was Home Secretary for six years, during which time she developed a reputation as an authoritarian who is tough on law and order.In 2011, she oversaw the replacement of control orders -- effectively placing terror suspects under house arrest -- with a more flexible measure involving shorter curfews, but this was after an internal battle with the then Prime Minister, David Cameron, who took a more liberal approach to law and order.On internet regulation, May was much more uncompromising, introducing greater powers for security services to carry out surveillance of peoples' online data -- known by critics as the \"Snoopers' Charter\" who were concerned about the privacy of innocent users.Doubling down on Internet monitoringArmed police outside Borough Market, London, Sunday June 4, 2017, near the scene of Saturday night's terrorist incident.The internet has once again become the focus of May's attention as Prime Minister: first, after Manchester, she secured the backing of G7 leaders for her demands for internet giants like Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to do more to stamp out extremism. Today, she has doubled down on that demand, saying: \"We cannot allow this ideology the safe space it needs to breed. Yet that is precisely what the internet -- and the big companies that provide internet-based services -- provide.\"Facebook has responded by insisting it is getting tough on those \"safe spaces\" and promising it will become a \"hostile environment for terrorists.\" There will now be a renewed appetite in Britain for tougher internet regulation when Parliament is reopened after the election -- but ISIS propaganda will always find a way to break through and find the troubled would-be perpetrators who know where to look for it.7 questions about the London terror attacksBut there are also similar \"safe spaces\" in the real world, that May says have been allowed to flourish because too many people are too tolerant of extremism. There are people in the Muslim community who will say they are already doing enough: Britain's intelligence agencies receive tip-offs all the time. In fact, as the Prime Minister herself said, five credible plots have been thwarted since the Westminster Bridge attack in March. MI5 was warned five times about the Manchester suicide bomber, Salman Abedi, but he was not stopped. The Prime Minister will have found it easy to revert to her authoritarian nature by declaring \"enough is enough\", but it is going to be difficult to translate those words into practise.",

The Frenchman described his team's season as \"spectacular.\" \"They made history, for sure,\" he told reporters. \"Nobody has done it, and now we have. Today is a historic day for all Madridistas, for the players, for me, for all our family.\"Although it was Real who opened the scoring through four-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo, the first half belonged to Juventus and, specifically, Mario Mandzukic, whose stunning overhead strike leveled the match. It was a goal which will be remembered as one of the most spectacular in Champions League history. Mario Mandzukic levels for Juventus from a seemingly impossible angleBut treble-chasing Juve's hopes were killed off after the break as Real rose to the occasion to complete their first league and cup double in 59 years and a third European Cup in four years. Casemiro's deflected long-range strike put the La Liga champions ahead once again, while Ronaldo and substitute Marco Asensio made sure of the victory. Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri said his team played \"beautifully\" in the first half, but admitted his opponents \"pressed the accelerator\" in the second half. READ: Zidane's Real -- good or greatWATCH: From tough neighborhood to football starREAD: From Cannes to Cardiff -- Zidane's incredible journeyA match like no otherThe match was being played amid heightened security following the Manchester terrorist attack which killed 22 people and injured many more just under a fortnight ago.Two-thousand police officers, including 200 armed officers, patrolled the streets of Cardiff on matchday as South Wales Police carried out what they had described as the \"biggest single sporting security operation in the UK.\"Major roads in the city center had been shut since midnight and would not open until 03:30 BST Sunday, while fans zones had been sectioned off with barriers, and water travel along the River Taff banned. Armed police outside the Principality Stadium in CardiffThe stadium's roof was also closed -- to prevent the possibility of a drone strike -- making it the first Champions League match to effectively be played indoors. However, such visible security precautions did not dampen the mood.The Welsh capital's streets were a river of humanity throughout the day as up to 170,000 people -- almost half the city's population -- helped create an astonishing atmosphere. Street merchants selling memorabilia had sold out of scarves six hours before kick-off as traders enjoyed a bumper day like no other in a city which is accustomed to hosting grand sporting occasions.  Cardiff was the host city for the 1999 Rugby World Cup and matches were held at the national stadium during the 2015 Rugby World Cup. But as South Wales Police assistant chief commissioner Richard Lewis told CNN before the match, this was an occasion of a \"different magnitude\".  Brilliant atmosphere, brilliant goalsSergio Ramos has now lifted the Champions League trophy three times in four yearsIt was a contest billed as attack versus defense. Real -- who have scored in every game this season -- had to crack the miserly Italian champions, whose defence had conceded just three goals in their 12 Champions League games to this final.What evolved, however, was a brilliantly attractive, inventive game, adorned by a sublime first-half goal. The Italians started the better, justifying Zidane's warnings that his former side was the complete outfit. Twice former Real striker Gonzalo Higuain tested goalkeeper Keylor Navas in the opening five minutes. But despite Juventus' dominance, it was Real who took the lead. With his first strike on goal, the ruthless Ronaldo found the bottom-left corner to score his 104th goal in the competition. Juventus responded quickly through Mandzukic when, 18 yards from goal, the Croat found the top-right corner with a breathtaking kick, setting off roars which were loud enough to uproot trees. Zidane is the first manager to win back-to-back European Cup/Champions League trophies since Arrigo Sacchi did so with AC Milan in 1989 & 1990But the second half belonged to Real. They controlled the match through the metronomic Luka Modric and struck twice in quick succession to ensure the Italians would suffer a fifth successive European Cup final defeat.  With 30 minutes remaining Casemiro's long-range strike deflected off former Real player Sami Khedira to wrong-foot Gianluigi Buffon in the Juve goal and Ronaldo provided the knockout blow, guiding home Luka Modric's cross from an acute angle.

It was an evening in which he could also celebrate scoring his 600th goal of an incredible career. \"This is one of the best moments of my career, but it seems I am able to say that every year,\" said Ronaldo, now a four-time European Cup champion.\"People won't be able to criticise me because the numbers don't lie.\"A comeback was made even more unlikely when substitute Juan Cuadrado was sent off for a second bookable offense just 18 minutes after entering the field. Juventus were made to suffer again on football's grandest stage. Having already won a record sixth consecutive Serie A title and the Italian Cup, they were bidding for the treble but, instead, lost for the seventh time in a European Cup final.Buffon has conceded six goals against Cristiano Ronaldo in five Champions League gamesFor 39-year-old Gianluigi Buffon, who will retire after the 2018 World Cup, it was likely his last chance to win European club football's premier prize.  But the brilliant goalkeeper, who would have become the competition's oldest winner had his team won, could do little about Real's goals. It was not to be the \"perfect finale\" he had talked about in the build up to the match.

They showed their class and the attitude needed to play in this kind of game.\"",

Billed as the world's biggest sporting rivalry, the two teams are expected to draw a global TV audience of over a billion when they face-off Sunday, in the fourth match of the ICC Champions Trophy, in Birmingham, England.The match -- their first encounter this year --  comes off the back of escalating political tensions between the two neighboring countries, following recent skirmishes along the border and a pending case at the International Court of Justice. On Monday, Indian Sports Minister Vijay Goel added more kindling to the fire when he told reporters that India would not play Pakistan in a bilateral series, while cross-border \"terror from Pakistan remains.\"Read More\"Terror and sports cannot go hand in hand,\" Goel added, referring to ongoing violence in the disputed Kashmir region.The Minister's proposed sporting boycott will not affect Sunday's tie, which is part of an international tournament, and not a bilateral five day series. When loyalties cross bordersAn Indian fan poses with  flags of India and Pakistan outside the Sardar Patel Gujarat Stadium, on December 28, 2012.India is the tournament's current reigning champion and hot favorite going into Sunday's match. But in the UK, where over two million people claim roots in either India or Pakistan, such odds are irrelevant.The match is only the fourth time the two teams have met competitively on British soil and the rarity of the event makes it a unique occasion for members of the UK's Indian and Pakistani diaspora. At the Osterley Cricket Club (OCC) in west London, expectation was mounting ahead of Sunday's match. \"I think it's great. It brings both nations together. We are away from our respective countries yet both Indian and Pakistani fans sit together and watch the game,\" said 24-year-old Arslan Yasin, who is one of several members of the OCC to claim South Asian heritage.In 2015, an estimated one billion people tuned in across the world to watch India beat Pakistan by 76 runs during the 2015 ICC World Cup in Australia.Brighter the blip, more the tweets!

For many overseas, the game represents more than just regional bragging rights: \"It's a showcase of exceptional talent, skills, temperament and fear on a platform witnessed by two great cricketing nations,\" said OCC member Raunik Patil, 31. Cricket's arch rivals JUST WATCHEDCooking with Indian cricket icon Virat KohliReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCooking with Indian cricket icon Virat Kohli 07:57The rivalry between the two nations dates back to 1952, just five years after independence, when India and Pakistan played their first test series. India hosted and went on to clinch victory.The first One Day International (ODI) games followed the 1978 Test series in Pakistan. Both were won by the host nation. Since 1952, India and Pakistan have played 15 Test series and 17 ODI series.\"My first memories of an India-Pakistan match are from when I was 13 years old, when India hosted Pakistan for a series of ODIs and Test matches. Pakistan won the ODIs and drew the Test. When the Pakistan team came back, everyone was happy,\" said Yasin, who moved to England from Pakistan as a teenager. \"But on the other side, the Indian fans were not (happy). They held protests, and burned effigies of players ... That was when I realized what Pakistan vs. India means for both nations,\" he added.Over the last decade, the two nations' sporting relationship has further deteriorated amid ongoing political confrontation. Pakistan cricketer Mohammad Amir (R) is dismissed by Indian cricketer Hardik Pandya during the match between India and Pakistan at the Asia Cup T20 cricket tournament at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Dhaka on February 27, 2016. Following the deadly 26/11 Mumbai attacks in 2008, which were blamed on a Pakistan-based militant group, India canceled their 2009 tour of Pakistan. The last India-Pakistan bilateral series took place in India in 2012, though the two rivals continue to play each other sporadically during international tournaments.Their most recent encounter was in 2016, when India won by six wickets in Kolkata during the ICC World Twenty20. The game was initially meant to be played in Dharamsala but was moved in order to provide adequate security.There have been repeated efforts from the cricketing communities within both Pakistan and India to organize a cricket series between the two nations, but political tensions have so far prevented it from happening. \"The Indian board has killed the excitement with politics being brought into the game. It's hurting cricket and fans are disillusioned with politicians,\" Nadeem Chowdhry, 50, an opening batsman who's played with the OCC for 15 years, told CNN.\"They should be using sport to lead the way for co-existing in peace. It's the only place where two teams representing their countries have nothing but to display cricketing skills to the world. Shame on those bodies stopping millions enjoying sport,\" he added.",
