        "content": "(CNN)London City Airport will remain closed through Monday after a World War II bomb was discovered by construction workers in the nearby Thames River a day earlier.After the discovery of the unexploded bomb near King George V Dock on Sunday, the airport canceled all flights and put an exclusion zone in place, airport Chief Executive Robert Sinclair said in a statement.\"I recognize this is causing inconvenience for our passengers,\" Sinclair added, saying that the airport is \"cooperating fully with the Met Police and Royal Navy and working hard to safely remove the device and resolve the situation as quickly as possible.\"The airport said it is \"hoping to resume normal operation\" on Tuesday, according to a tweet from the airport's official account, and urged all passengers due to fly to contact their airlines for further information.Metropolitan Police and the Royal Navy were deployed to the scene to examine the bomb and have confirmed it as a \"500 kg (1102 pounds) tapered end shell measuring approximately 1.5 meters (4.9 feet),\" according to a police statement issued Monday. \"The timing of removal is dependent on the tides, however, at this stage we estimate that the removal of the device from location will be completed by tomorrow morning.\"Read MoreThe Royal Navy implemented the 214-meter exclusion zone to \"ensure that the ordnance can be safely dealt with whilst limiting any risk to the public,\" the police statement said. In an effort to minimize the disruption, officers are going to homes within the exclusion zone to make residents aware of any safety arrangement put in place, the statement added.London City is an international airport located in the borough of Newham in East London. The area was heavily industrial and highly populated during WWII. The Royal Docks, where the runway is now located, were a main entry point on the Thames for goods and commerce.The airport, which is much smaller than London Heathrow Airport, caters to business travelers heading to destinations in the UK, Europe and the United States.CNN's Hilary McGann contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)In case you missed it, there was some seriously good Olympic figure skating this weekend. Sure, yes, Adam Rippon is a national delight and Mirai Nagasu's mind-blowing triple axel was the thing of Olympic dreams, but let's not forget that an 18-year-old Russian figure skater also rolled out a short program with the theme of \"clinical death.\"Yep, if you were watching NBC's enhanced coverage of the events, you were treated to the fun trivia that Evgenia Medvedeva \"said that her short program is about 'the flight of the soul' as it leaves someone's body at the point of 'clinical death.'\"Festive! Apparently souls get a pass through the bedazzler before fleeing this mortal realm. The routine itself was -- forgive the pun -- breathtaking, set to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin's famous Nocturne in C-sharp minor (which is as mournful and fitting a death song as any). In fact,  Medvedeva earned herself a world-record-breaking 81.06, the highest score ever for the ladies' short program. Her performance also earned 10 points for her team, Olympic Athletes from Russia (you'll recall the Russian Olympic team is banned from this year's games). \n\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with the young Russian's body of work, when it comes to themes and music Medvedeva has a, er, taste for the unusual. She raised eyebrows at the World Figure Skating Championships last year when she skated to a score excerpt from the film \"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close\" that included audio from 9/11. She set a world record with that routine too, and won gold. Evgenia Medvedeva performs at the gala exhibition during day four of the 2017 ISU World Team Trophy in Tokyo, Japan.Read MoreOn a lighter note, Medvedeva is also an unapologetic anime and Kpop fan, and she is well-known in certain corners of the internet for her delightful and completely batcrackers routine set to the \"Sailor Moon\" transformation theme.",

Follow @cnnsport\n\nHe's begun on the right track, too, leading the his favorite halfpipe event after two qualifying runs with a best score of 98.5 out of 100 in Pyeongchang. White has been in front most of his life. He went to Sochi looking for a \"three-peat\" -- a third straight Olympic halfpipe gold medal to take his stock stratospheric.\n\n\n\n\nHe also took on the new slopestyle event to keep his flame burning for the sport, but expectation and injury struck.Read MoreHe injured his wrist in a fall in slopestyle and fell on his final run in the halfpipe, finishing fourth. The legend was intact, but White was bruised and burned out. \"At the time I was burning out. It's hard to admit,\" White told reporters in South Korea. \"At the time my heart wasn't in it.\"It's like if you've ever been in a relationship and someone is like, they love you.

He needed to scratch that Olympics itch. READ: Chloe Kim -- America's 17-year-old snowboarding sensationHowever, his preparations for the Games received a bloody nose -- literally -- when he smashed into the lip of the halfpipe while training in New Zealand in October and needed 62 stitches to his head and face.  Crashes go with the territory in the world of halfpipe snowboarding when athletes fly high above the 22ft walls of pipe and perform a series of tricks, twists and upside down turns, with names like double cork 1440 or switch double-cork 1260.White knows the rules of the game, and knew he had to get back in the saddle.In January he did just that and the man they used to call the\"Flying Tomato \" because of his shock of red hair earned a perfect score of 100 in the US Grand Prix in Snowmass, Colorado to secure Olympic qualification.

That's just something competitors at this level just don't do.\"He didn't think he was going to the Olympics, and he wanted to see what someone could do on his sled,\" said Mazdzer, who would not name the Russian. \"It was a legitimate sled. It wasn't, 'We'll give you a sled and it's like something that's 20 years old.' This was what they were using this year.\"And Mazdzer, who was training in Latvia a few weeks ago, needed a boost. He'd hit a rough spot in his training, and voiced his frustrations on social media.    I took this picture right after walking home from the track after a less than ideal race. Even after an hour I could still feel the anger, frustration and disappointment deep inside and it was still coming through my eyes.  What kills me on the inside is not the fact I made a few small mistakes, what kills me and has been driving me wild for over a year now is the fact that no matter what I do my top speed and ability to be with the top guys in the world has disappeared, and I don't know why. (Also probably the fact that I really care)  There comes a point where giving it everything you have and believing in yourself starts to fade away and I am almost to that point. For some reasons unknown to myself, things are not working out as planned. Why keep pushing on then?  Well, for starters I still believe in myself and am confident with my sliding and starts. I am not someone to walk a way during a struggle although this struggle seems to be getting the best of me... Finally, there is no way I can give up with the biggest race of my life being just weeks away and even though the last thing I want to do right now is think about Luge, that's what I am going to do this afternoon.  There is a light somewhere in this dark cave that I feel like I am stumbling aimlessly through at times and you better damn believe I'm going to find it.  Thank you to everyone who has always believed in me, I want you to know that you always help me get through the tough times and I am looking forward to sleighing the future \ud83d\ude09\ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffc I thought about waiting to post this until after laying down and contemplating things over but writing that actually felt very cathartic. Screw it, post!

The Antonov An-148 aircraft was carrying 65 passengers and six crew members, the Russian news agency Interfax said. The passengers included three children, ages 5, 13 and 17, state news agency RIA reported. Debris was found about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Moscow's Domodedovo Airport on Sunday. The plane was headed to the Russian city of Orsk, near the border with Kazakhstan. But it disappeared from radar shortly after takeoff from Moscow's Domodedovo Airport, Russian state news agency Tass reported. The plane went down in Ramenskoye District, in the Moscow region, the Russian emergency ministry told CNN. \"The snow is very dense ... the Moscow region has had some of its heaviest snowfall in decades,\" CNN's Matthew Chance reported from Moscow. \"It's not clear at this stage whether weather was factor in this crash.\"Read MoreBoth flight recorders from the plane were in the hands of investigators Monday.The onboard voice recorder for cockpit conversations was found Monday in \"satisfactory condition,\" an emergency representative at the crash site told RIA. The other device on the aircraft -- the flight data recorder registering details such as speed and altitude -- was recovered on Sunday.The cause of the crash remains uncertain. The Investigative Committee of Russia said officials have launched a criminal investigation, as all possible causes are being explored. In a statement, the White House said the United States \"is deeply saddened by the tragic deaths\" of the Saratov Airlines passengers and crew.\"We send our condolences to the families of those who lost their lives and to the people of Russia,\" the statement said. Widespread debrisMore wreckage was found scattered across the snowy terrain.\"The scatter of fragments of the aircraft and bodies of dead passengers occupies a large territory; the radius is not less than 1 kilometer (0.6 miles),\" said Svetlana Petrenko, spokeswoman the Investigative Committee of Russia. Authorities have started questioning Saratov Airlines employees and the Domodedovo Airport workers who prepared the plane for flight, Petrenko said. Russian President Vladimir Putin \"deep condolences to all those who lost relatives and friends in this disaster,\" his spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, according to Tass. The An-148 is a Ukrainian-designed regional jet that was first introduced in 2009. Eastern European-made aircraft haven't always matched their western counterparts in reliability and safety. Russian state airline GTK Rossiya, the first carrier to operate the jet that crashed Sunday, was sharply critical in 2010 of the An-148's reliability early on in its service, citing problems with major components like engines and electrical systems, according to Flightglobal.The jet that crashed Sunday was part of the batch of planes that GTK Rossiya had complained about several years ago, according to the 2010 Flightglobal report. A near-perfect safety recordSunday's disaster ends a 440-day streak without a commercial passenger jet fatality -- the longest stretch in modern aviation history. Saratov Airlines, a regional carrier, had no crashes until Sunday. But in October 2015, Russian aviation regulators temporarily banned Saratov from conducting international flights after a surprise inspection. That inspection led to the discovery that a close relative of the airline's general director was \"in the cockpit during operations,\" said ch-aviation, which maintains aviation industry data. Saratov resumed international flights six months later. CNN's Jon Ostrower, Tim Lister, Milena Veselinovic and Darran Simon contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)She's been training this dangerous jump for  years. And finally, under the bask of Olympic lights, Mirai Nagasu did something no other American woman has ever done at the Olympics: She landed a triple axel. Why this is so massively impressive: The axel jump was first invented in 1882 \u2014 by a guy named Axel Paulsen. But he only did a single axel. It took more than 90 years for the first man to land a triple axel. And it wasn't until 1991 that the first American woman landed a triple axel. That was Tonya Harding at the 1991 US championships. \n\n\nRead MoreAt the Olympic level, Nagasu is only the third woman -- and the first American woman -- to successfully complete the triple axel;  the other two are Japanese skaters Midori Ito and Mao Asada.Why the triple axel is so rare to pull off:You're racing across the ice at full speed and suddenly you skid off the edge of one blade. Your skate goes perpendicular, which forces you to stop moving forward. All that momentum hurls you up into the air instead of across the ice.While hanging midair, you spin your body around 3 1/2 rotations in less than a second \u2014 estimated by some university studies to be more than 300 revolutions per minute. Finally, you land on the foot that you didn't use for the takeoff. And you come down with immense force -- more than four times your body weight. So a 125-pound skater like Nagasu would feel the impact of more than 500 pounds of force on a 1/4-inch thin blade.What makes it so difficult:You have to take off forward, with your blade skidding sideways, and land skating backward.If you slip, you could seriously wipe out. Common injuries are stress fractures, broken bones and hip and knee damage -- some of which could easily ruin careers. Proper air position is critical to completing all 3 1/2 revolutions.OK, so what's the next big figure skating move?The quadruple axel \u2014 the only quad jump that's never been done in competition. That's 4 1/2 rotations.READ: These Olympic figure skaters will blow your mind",

        "content": "(CNN)She's just 17 years old, half the age of some of her teammates, but snowboarder Chloe Kim isn't at the Winter Olympics just to make up the numbers. The Californian teenager is already a slopestyle and halfpipe phenomenon, redefining the boundaries of her sport while most of her friends are finishing high school.When she was 15, Kim became the first female snowboarder in history to land back-to-back 1080 degree spins in competition, at the US Snowboarding Grand Prix in February 2016.I've this unique opportunity to represent both Korea and the USThat combination gave her a perfect score of 100, a feat only otherwise achieved by the legendary Shaun White.In Monday's halfpipe qualifying runs in Pyeongchang, Kim scored 91.50 -- nearly four points better than any of her rivals. In the final, she clinched gold with her first run and then wowed the crowd with a spectacular second effort to earn a near-perfect score of 98.25 out of 100. Read More\"There was a lot of pressure, but I'm happy I was able to do it here and do it for the fans and the family,\" she said.\"I'm so happy I was able to land and being here is so exciting, this has been a dream of mine.\"Stoked to have put this down today \ud83d\ude4a pic.twitter.com/sYbet58x1Z\u2014 Chloe Kim (@chloekimsnow) February 7, 2016\n\nIn short, though her career is only just beginning, Kim is already well on the way to becoming a legend of her sport. And she doesn't just have the hopes of one nation resting on her shoulders. \"It's very special,\" Kim told CNN. \"I feel like I have this unique opportunity to represent both Korea and the US.\"Everyone's really happy and I think this is the best scenario ever. At the end of the day, I'm so grateful that I get to be out here and represent the US in the country that my family came from. It's a very big blessing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n A Korean-American iconBack in 1982, Kim's father Jong Jin emigrated from South Korea to the US as a young man with big ambitions.It was a desire to lure his wife Boran Yun Kim onto the slopes that gave the young snowboarding prodigy her first experience of the sport.\"He wanted my mom to go with him,\" Chloe explained. \"So he took me as bait.\"Aged just four at the time and at best ambivalent about the cold, it wasn't long before Chloe was bombing down the mountain on her $25 board, leaving her parents in her tracks.  By the age of six she was competing in junior competitions around the US. By the time she reached 10, Jong Jin had quit his job to facilitate her development full-time. \"What would happen is that he would carry me out of bed,\" Chloe recalled in 2016. \"I would wake up in a new spot every time without even knowing what happened.\"How those long early morning drives to California's Mammoth Mountain have paid off. Already a four-time X Games SuperPipe champion, Kim traveled to her first ever Olympic Games among the favorites for the gold medal. It was also something of a homecoming. \"I definitely have a lot of Korean-American fans which is amazing,\" Kim tells CNN, having inspired South Korean children some 5,000 miles away to follow in her footsteps.\"I think my family are just so excited,\" she adds. \"My grandma is in Korea. I have two aunts and three cousins in Korea as well.\"But I love all my fans. I love meeting them. I'm so happy to have all this support from everyone around the world and I'm forever thankful for all of them.\" JUST WATCHEDChloe Kim: Snowboarding's next legend?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHChloe Kim: Snowboarding's next legend? 01:16READ: Tonga's famous flag bearer achieves 'impossible dreamREAD: From one-room home in Ghana to Winter OlympicsREAD: Indian luge athlete 'maxed out' his cards to reach OlympicsSochi 2014It is testament to Kim's prodigious talent that her extended family saw her compete for the first time at the very highest level. Incredibly, only age restrictions stopped the young snowboarder participating at the last Winter Games, four years ago in Sochi. Team USA coaches estimate that Kim was among the world's top three halfpipe competitors, even then.Now, with the benefit of hindsight, she acknowledges the ruling was in place for a reason.\"I think I was a little bummed out then, but now that I look back at it, I think I'm kind of glad that I wasn't old enough to go last time,\" Kim reflects.  \"It's too much stress for a 13-year-old, so I'm actually really happy that I wasn't able to go.  \"But, equally, I was so lucky to still be able to go through the whole qualification process when I was 13. That experience really helped me this year, knowing ahead of time what it was going to be like, what the pressure was going to be like. I think that was very comforting for me.\" 'I loved watching Kelly Clark snowboard growing up'Another comfort for Kim is knowing she can count one of her greatest idols among her US teammates.Snowboarding legend Kelly Clark, 34, has already won three halfpipe Olympic medals -- securing the first (gold at Salt Lake City in 2002) just two years after Kim was born.Their paths first crossed in the lift line at Mammoth Mountain when Kim was eight.\"She tugged on my sleeve and asked to go up the lift with me,\" recalled Clark. \"It was pretty cute.\"Kim joined her on the ascent and, less than a decade later, she has arguably surpassed her. Both have their place assured in the history books.In 2011, Clark became the first woman ever to land a frontside 1080 while Kim was still in elementary school. Then at that US Snowboarding Grand Prix in 2016, Kim laid down her own marker -- nailing a 1080 degree spin just like Clark, before immediately following it up with another. 'Everyone has their own unique style''Two people can make the same trick look completely different''That's what's so beautiful about snowboarding''Unique and beautiful'The media glare and global acclaim in Pyeongchang is likely to far exceed anything Kim has experienced before.

Follow @cnnsport\n\nWhile it's not uncommon for Alpine sports to face high winds and excessive snow, the extreme conditions in Pyeongchang have made staging events increasingly challenging.Officials have called-off several competitions including the women's giant slalom which was due to take place Monday at the Yongpyong Alpine Center. Read MoreThe weather could become \"a real problem for the organizers because this is forecast to last for at least the next four days,\" CNN's Christina Macfarlane reported from the Games.      The women's giant slalom has been rescheduled for Thursday, according to the US Ski and Snowboard Team -- the same day as the postponed men's downhill race, which was delayed on Sunday.Olympic downhill is traditionally one of the Games' biggest draws and this year's competition is likely the last chance for Olympic veterans like Aksel Lund Svindal and Lindsey Vonn to win gold. Ninety-eight-percent of the snow on the course is artificial as the weather is too cold for the snow to fall.

Bone-chilling gusts of wind tore through the mountains as American snowboarder Jamie Anderson managed to successfully retain the title, while Laurie Blouin from Canada won silver and Finland's Enni Rukajarvi took home bronze.

The International Ski Federation also issued a statement on Monday in response to athletes, coaches and fans who complained about the strong winds which made conditions \"dangerous\" and made it tough for some athletes to perform at their best. FIS said it \"would never stage a competition\" if the safety of athletes could not be assured. The organization added the weather was deemed stable enough for the competition to continue after a 30-minute delay where officials monitored conditions and a 45-minute training session without problems. \n\n\n\n\nHowever, some competitors have come to the IOC's defense, praising organizers for their handling of the events. After qualification for the snowboard ladies' halfpipe final at the Phoenix Snow Park on Monday, American Chloe Kim described the conditions as \"amazing\" while Emily Arthur from Australia called the atmosphere \"insane.\"\"This is the best pipe I've ever ridden,\" Arthur said.  \n\n\nOn Sunday, Australian snowboarder Tess Coady lamented the conditions many are facing after suffering a serious injury during a practice session. \"Well Olympics came to a screeching holt today for me... got picked up in the wind on the bottom jump in practice and my acl was not a big fan!

        "content": "London (CNN)Oxfam's deputy chief executive has resigned amid a growing sex crimes scandal involving the organization's aid workers in Haiti and Chad.Penny Lawrence is the first executive at the organization to quit after the scandal and allegations of a coverup emerged last week.Oxfam announced the resignation after a meeting with UK government officials Monday, at which it had fought to keep millions of pounds in public funding.Oxfam's leaders are accused of trying to cover up the behavior of some of its senior staff members deployed to Haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake that killed between 200,000 and 300,000 people.The aid workers -- including the Oxfam country director at the time, Roland van Hauwermeiren -- were accused of turning a villa rented by the organization into a makeshift brothel, with prostitutes wearing only Oxfam T-shirts. Read MoreEarthquake survivors put up tents throughout the Haitian capital.The Times newspaper in London made the allegations in an investigation published at the end of last week. \"It is now clear that these allegations -- involving the use of prostitutes and which related to behavior of both the Country Director and members of his team in Chad -- were raised before he moved to Haiti,\" Lawrence said, referring to van Hauwermeiren.\"As program director at the time, I am ashamed that this happened on my watch and I take full responsibility.\"Haiti considers legal actionOxfam is one of the UK's largest and most prominent aid organizations, operating development programs in more than 90 countries around the world. The agency also offers assistance to people after emergencies and disasters.International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt warned that Oxfam could lose millions of pounds in public funding because of the scandal. Oxfam received about \u00a332 million (about $44 million) from the government last year, according to public records. Mordaunt said on Monday that the organization made a \"full and unqualified apology\" to her and to the people of Britain and Haiti. In a statement, Mordaunt said that the charity apologized for \"the appalling behavior of some of their staff in Haiti in 2011, and for the wider failings of their organization's response to it.\"Our statement on Haiti and Chad. Let us be clear: their behavior was and still is totally unacceptable -- an appalling mark against the high values we set for ourselves at Oxfam. https://t.co/odiDBHOU2J\u2014 Oxfam International (@Oxfam) February 11, 2018\n\nA Downing Street spokesman said Monday that the British government had taken action to enforce a \"zero-tolerance approach\" to allegations of \"horrific behavior\" by Oxfam staff. He gave no details on what the actions were.Oxfam could also face legal action in Haiti. The country is considering pursuing criminal charges, the Haitian chief of mission to the UK, Bocchit Edmond, told CNN on Monday. Edmond said that Oxfam representatives in Haiti would be summoned by the Foreign Ministry.  \"We will look at the issue, and hopefully there will be sharing of information, and then I believe there are some grounds for legal actions.\" Mordaunt said that Oxfam told her that they are cooperating with authorities in Haiti and in any other country where abuse is exposed. In a meeting on Monday with Oxfam Chief Executive Officer Mark Goldring and Chair of Trustees Caroline Thomson, Mordaunt said she told them they must demonstrate the moral leadership necessary to address the scandal and rebuild the trust of the British public, their staff and the people they aim to help.Oxfam's sex scandal won't surprise anyone who has worked in a war zone\"It is on the basis of their actions going forward -- rather than of their commitments in one meeting today -- that I and others will judge them. I was clear that part of an organization's moral leadership comes from individuals taking responsibility for their actions.\"In an interview with the BBC, Goldring said that in his meeting with Mordaunt, he \"recommitted to take still more steps because we know we have not done enough\" to deal with the behavior.He added, though, that the issue of sexual abuse by aid workers is not limited to Oxfam. \"This is a much bigger issue than Oxfam, who are among the leading agencies in trying to address it. Actually, it's an issue for the sector. Oxfam has failed -- let me be clear on that -- but it's a sector-wide concern.\"No coverup, Oxfam claimsA second report by the Times said Oxfam failed to warn nongovernmental organizations about the allegations, allowing some of the accused to get jobs at other aid agencies.Oxfam in Haiti and Chad in 2017Oxfam provided food support, cash, vouchers, cooking equipment, seeds and tools to people in Chad.After Hurricane Irma tore through the Caribbean, Oxfam said it would work to prevent the spread of diseases that spread when water infrastructure is damaged, like cholera, by helping hygiene and sanitation efforts.The UK Charity Commission, an independent regulator of charities in England and Wales, opened a statutory inquiry into Oxfam following the revelations of sexual impropriety in Haiti. The decision to launch an inquiry comes after Oxfam provided the regulator with documents pertaining to allegations of misconduct by its staff in Haiti in 2011, the agency said in a statement Monday.\"The Commission has concerns that Oxfam may not have fully and frankly disclosed material details about the allegations at the time in 2011, its handling of the incidents since, and the impact that these have both had on public trust and confidence,\" the agency said.Previously, the Charity Commission told CNN that Oxfam informed the agency in August 2011 that the charity was conducting an internal investigation related to inappropriate sexual behavior, bullying, harassment and the intimidation of staff. But Mordaunt said the aid organization failed to reveal the scope and key details of the case. \"They let individuals who had undertaken criminal activity, they let them go. They did not tell prosecution authorities, they did not tell their regulator and they did not tell their donors,\" Mordaunt told the BBC.Oxfam did not deny the accusations against its staff members, but it denied a coverup, saying that it launched a swift internal investigation after it became aware of the allegations. Four people were fired and another three resigned, including van Hauwermeiren, the charity said.Port-au-Prince in Haiti became a city of camps for internally displaced people after the 2010 earthquake.Oxfam's own policy prohibits \"sexually abusive or exploitative acts being perpetrated\" by employees, including paying for sex.Oxfam has announced it would strengthen its staff vetting procedures and introduce a whistleblower helpline as part of a package of reforms.\"It is not sufficient to be appalled by the behavior of our former staff -- we must and will learn from it and use it as a spur to improvement,\" Thomson said in a statement.'Tip of the iceberg'On Sunday, the aid agency said it had been \"shocked and dismayed\" to hear more allegations about the use of sex workers by Oxfam staff in Chad in 2006.\"While we can't corroborate the information from Chad at the moment, it highlights again unacceptable behavior by a small number of people and the need for a sector-wide approach to tackle the problem,\" Oxfam said in a statement.Oxfam works with local farmers in Chad to improve their crops and provides water and sanitation services to refugees in local camps, the organization says on its website.The allegations against Oxfam in two different countries have raised concerns that the problem of sex crimes by aid workers abroad could be widespread. Mordaunt's predecessor, Priti Patel, shared concerns about a coverup and wrote in the Telegraph on Monday that the Oxfam scandal was just \"the tip of the iceberg.\"In an interview with Sky News, Patel said, \"I did my own research and I have to say I had a lot of pushback within my own department ... that is the scandal.\"\"People knew about this,\" she said. Patel resigned last year after making a secret trip to Israel and holding undisclosed meetings with Israeli officials, setting off a political firestorm. She also said that British nationals accused of wrongdoing while doing charity work abroad with public funds should be tried in the UK.CNN's Hilary McGann, Lindsay Isaac, Milena Veselinovic and Simon Cullen contributed to this report from London.",

        "content": "Rome (CNN)The shooting of African migrants allegedly by a suspect aligned with Italy's far-right, neo-fascist parties has sparked serious political debate about how the country is reconciling its fascist past.Luca Traini is accused of going on a shooting rampage February 3 in the central Italian town of Macerata and performing the fascist salute upon his arrest. Six African migrants were injured. The migrants are part of the wave of more than 600,000 people who have arrived by sea from North Africa since 2013 when Italy last went to the polls. On Saturday, thousands of centrist and leftist supporters gathered under heavy police guard in Macerata to demonstrate against the rise of Italy's neo-fascist parties. Organizers say 15,000 people attended. The march was held inside a fenced-off perimeter, and police banned fascist groups from participating. Supporters waved Communist Party and Antifa (anti-fascist) flags. Some held banners with \"anti-fascism\" and \"anti-racism,\" while others displayed signs with fascist and Nazi symbols crossed out. Few migrants joined the march, according to Sammy Kunoun, head of the Nigerian Community of Macerata. Police had strongly discouraged migrant groups from protesting.Read MorePeople take part in an anti-racism demonstration Saturday in Macerata, Italy.Anti-fascist demonstrations were held in other Italian cities, including Piacenza, where the far-right, neo-fascist fringe group CasaPound engaged in violent clashes with police, according to Italian news reports. On Wednesday, a group of supporters of the Forza Nuova neo-fascist party, which openly supports the recent shooting spree and has offered to pay the suspect's legal bills, clashed with police in Macerata, which has a high concentration of African migrants and those seeking political asylum. History of fascismSeveral Italian parties support fascist ideology and publicly align themselves with the tenets of fascism, but they cannot call themselves fascist. The 1952 Scelba law makes an \"apology for fascism\" illegal in Italy, and people can be arrested for making fascist salutes, but it is not illegal to sell memorabilia with fascist symbols or the image of former dictator Benito Mussolini. Legislation introduced in 2017 sought to make it illegal to sell such fascist souvenirs, but it stalled in Parliament. Mussolini's hometown of Predappio is a popular pilgrimage spot for neo-fascists who still support the ideology. People gather there every October on the anniversary of the March on Rome -- which led to Mussolini's rise to power in 1922 -- and his birth home and family tomb are popular among neo-fascists, who lay flowers on the date of his birth and death. Souvenir shops sell Mussolini wine, batons, towels and key chains with Il Duce's face.Mussolini's hometown plans fascism museumThe weekend of the Macerata shooting, the film \"Sono Tornato,\" or \"I'm Back,\" opened, envisioning Mussolini coming back to Italy in 2018 to see what of his fascist ideology remains. The official trailer depicts the film as a comedy in which Il Duce, still in his fascist uniform, performs fascist salutes to passers-by and reminisces about his time as head of the nation, pointing out what symbols and traditions remain.The suspect gave a fascist salute in front of a war monument built during the fascist era when police arrested him last week. He had run in local elections under the far-right Northern League party, whose leader Matteo Salvini has backed banning mosques and whose main campaign promises is to expel 100,000 Africans immediately if he comes to power. A man holds a flare in front of an anti-fascism banner during a protest Saturday in Macerata.Police said the suspect said he was avenging the death of Pamela Mastropietro, 18, whose body was found dismembered in two suitcases outside Macerata on January 30. Nigerian migrant Innocent Oseghale was arrested in connection with her death but has not been charged with murder. Initial autopsy reports point to a heroin overdose as her cause of death, but the final coroner's report will not be out for three more weeks, around the time of the March 4 national election. A promise to expel migrantsRecent polling by La Stampa newspaper points to a good showing for a center-right coalition led by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, Salvini's Northern League party and Giorgia Meloni's Fratelli d'Italia party. Silvio Berlusconi says migrants causing 'serious social alarm' in ItalyBerlusconi, who cannot run for elections because of a tax fraud conviction, has promised to expel 600,000 migrants if his party is elected. Meloni held a rally last week in the town of Latina, near Rome. Mussolini founded Latina in 1932, and the town retains strong fascist ties to that era. During the rally, Meloni brought Rachele Mussolini, Mussolini's granddaughter, on stage to support her anti-immigration platform.\"If we need to do a naval blockade, we will do a naval blockade. If we need to dig trenches, we will dig trenches,\" Meloni told the rally with Mussolini's granddaughter by her side. \"No one enters Italy illegally, and those who have will be sent home.\" A larger anti-fascist demonstration is scheduled for February 24, one week before the national election, in other cities across Italy, with the largest set for Rome.",

When the game ended, the thrill of victory sent players hugging, jumping and high-fiving across the ice. \"What a great way to head off,\" said Greenway.Late last year, Greenway got word he'd been chosen for Team USA. \"My coach called me ... and it was probably the greatest Christmas present I've ever gotten,\" Greenway recalled.\n\n\n\n\nRead MoreThis 6-foot-5, 230-pound junior has already been drafted by a pro team  -- the Minnesota Wild. But instead of going pro, he chose to stay in school -- opening the door for this gentle giant to make history as an amateur athlete.In fact, this is the first time in three decades that the US men's Olympic hockey team has been comprised of amateur athletes. The reason: the professional National Hockey League chose not to send any of its players to compete in the Olympics this time. Born to skateAs a kid, Greenway proved to be a natural on the ice, beginning when he first put on skates at the early age of 3. \"Jordan always played football and lacrosse, but hockey was the one sport he always went 110%,\" Greenway's mother, Shannon Sullivan, recalled.Hockey was everywhere in the upstate New York town of Canton where he grew up -- not far from the Canadian border. Greenway remembers that everyone played hockey and ice rinks were peppered all over town.   Greenway has been playing hockey since childhood. Greenway and his younger brother JD were both standouts on the ice and very competitive.  \"JD was probably the better athlete in the family, but yeah, no matter whether we were playing hockey or football or rock, paper, scissors, whatever the case was, we always wanted to win, so I think that's really allowed us to continue to work hard and have the success that we've had up to this point,\" Greenway said.JD -- who has been a big influence on Greenway's life -- grew up to be a powerhouse on the ice like his brother. He now plays hockey at the University of Wisconsin. \n\n\nThe Greenway brothers are helping to change the face of hockey. The majority of NHL players are white, but that's has never stopped Greenway.\"There wasn't a lot of African-Americans playing and I think, honestly, outside of my brother and I, I can't think of a ton ... so I just kind of grew up around it and it was kinda the norm.\"Sullivan taught her sons to be open-minded and to not see stereotypes. \"She prepped me and my brother pretty well,\" he said. \"She always let us know that yeah, we'd probably be a little bit different than a lot of the other people in the town, but it's just the way it is and you're just like everyone else.\"'He's making history'\"It's no secret that there's not as many African-Americans playing hockey,\" Greenway said. His mother says it's surreal.  \"It brings tears to my eyes every time because ... my son's going to the Olympics, and then he's also breaking the color barrier as well...I don't know how to describe it. It's just something that you would never think of.\" Greenway, a 6-foot-five junior, has already been drafted by the Minnesota Wild.\"I mean he's making history and I'm so proud of him.\"His coach, David Quinn, says it's an incredible opportunity and is excited for Greenway. \"He's come a long way in the last two-and-a-half years and we're kind of joking if you'd ever told both of us he'd be playing on the Olympic team, when he got here nobody would've believed it. But it's a deserving honor.\"'Try something different'Sullivan will be watching from home as her son makes history on the Olympic stage.\"My advice to him is going to be, do your best. That's what I expect of you is to do your best, whether you bring home the gold or not ...Try to bring home the gold, and if you don't, that's okay. Know that mom will be watching you from home. We'll all be supporting you from Canton.\"Greenway's ultimate goals include playing in the Olympics more than once, competing in the NHL and becoming a role model to other African Americans in hockey.\"I'm the first African American to play hockey for the United States at the Olympics but hopefully I'm the first of many,\" Greenway said. \"Hopefully these kids go out, try something different, play hockey, and hopefully I see a lot more playing in the near future.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)She was hailed a \"phenom\" even before winning gold at Sochi 2014, now Mikaela Shiffrin is aiming for legendary status in Pyeongchang.Four years ago, the American became the youngest ever Olympic slalom champion as an 18-year-old and she goes to South Korea as a three-time world champion with a lively chance of taking home three gold medals. Follow @cnnsport\n\nThe hype needle has surged into the red zone.Shiffrin is hot favorite to defend her slalom crown, and is a very real contender in giant slalom and the combined (downhill and slalom). And she could win more if she decides to add the speed events to her Games schedule.  \"You've got to be talented to ski like this, but talent is 10 per cent and hard work is 90 per cent,\" Shiffrin's agent Kilian Albrecht, a two-time Olympian himself, told CNN Sport.Read More\"With Mikaela it's a combination of hard work, being really talented, being really focused and having the drive and wanting to win.\"So, what goes into making the complete skier? Shiffrin's coach Jeff Lackie gave CNN Sport a unique insight into the training methods of an Olympic champion.READ: The team behind Mikaela ShiffrinJUST WATCHEDMikaela Shiffrin: I'm chasing the worldReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMikaela Shiffrin: I'm chasing the world 01:23The theory Shiffrin has been all-conquering this season, with 10 wins in 20 races, including five in a row after Christmas. Her prodigious tally is now up to 41 World Cup wins. To put that in perspective, Lindsey Vonn -- only five World Cup wins behind Ingemar Stenmark's all-time record of 86 -- had seven at the same age.Significantly, Shiffrin also reaped the rewards of a renewed focus on speed training to clinch her first ever World Cup downhill win in December.But what are the requirements of skiing's different disciplines? Can a slalom skier pull off the Olympic equivalent of Usain Bolt winning the 3,000 meters?\"Skiing is a power sport so the ultimate limiting factor to an athlete's success is their ability to produce force and raise power,\"  says Canadian Lackie.  READ: 'Nobody to somebody' -- How Olympic downhill gold is a badge for lifeJUST WATCHEDMikaela Shiffrin's snoozy secretReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMikaela Shiffrin's snoozy secret 02:50 Shiffrin stands 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighs 145 pounds, similar to four years ago but with more \"baby fat\" converted to muscle, according to Albrecht. That's compared to speed specialist Vonn's 5 feet 10 inches and 160 pounds, according to the US Ski Team website.Downhillers are often intimated by slalom because they feel the gates are coming at them so fast, whereas slalom skiers are intimidated by the sheer speed of downhillMikaela Shiffrin's coach Jeff Lackie\"There's no arguing having additional mass is going to benefit athletes because gravity is our primary driver but you can't ignore the strength-to-weight ratio,\" says Lackie.He uses the analogy of a race car that can accelerate quickly in a straight line but is cumbersome around corners. The optimum downhill body type, he says, is one that can overcome up to three times its body weight in jumps or big direction changes, but can still get into an aerodynamic position and be fluid and dynamic on the skis. \"In slalom it's about how quickly athletes can generate force in a different direction to oppose what gravity or centrifugal force or a sudden change of direction is causing,\" he says.\"Slalom skiers are faster at generating force but produce less absolute force than a downhiller would. \"With Mikaela we're looking to find that balance where she has that strength and power to be competitive in all events. I think we've struck a pretty good balance right now.\"READ: Lindsey Vonn and Mikaela Shiffrin speak out against Russian dopingTeam USA's Mikaela Shiffrin became the youngest women's slalom champion with gold in Sochi. The training -- In the gymA strong cardiovascular system is important to enable faster recovery, which enables more high repetitions of quality training, says Lackie, but for him the real training focus is on power.Mikaela's a standout because of her mental toughness and because of her perseveranceMikaela Shiffrin's coach Jeff Lackie\"Even though Mikaela makes slalom look effortless, much like a figure skater or a ballerina moving gracefully across the stage, there is a huge power component to that which makes that huge bound or series of tight turns look effortless,\" says Lackie.The bulk of Shiffrin's work is squats and various types of lifts with a weighted bar, emphasizing \"eccentric overload training\" -- in terms of a squat, this would be the \"down\" phase when the muscle is lengthening, which is a more efficient way of targeting the muscle than concentrating on how much she can lift.\"From there, we would tailor your spectrum, so for a slalom skier we would focus on a higher bar velocity -- moving the load quicker -- whereas a downhiller can afford to lift the bar at a slower velocity but with more weight,\" says Lackie.\"We use a device called GymAware which mounts on the bar and measures speed of movement. In Mikaela's case when we're focusing on a tech (slalom) block we'll look for higher bar velocity on her primary lifts to replicate the speed of movement and rate of force development qualities we're going to expect on race day.\" JUST WATCHEDMikaela Shiffrin 'scared' by Russian dopingReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMikaela Shiffrin 'scared' by Russian doping 01:13Every five days or so Lackie will incorporate plyometrics or body weight training, and lung busters such as sprints pulling a weighted sled. \"We try to incorporate all the attributes she needs to be successful all season long. We never go through a period where we focus on one single attribute. We try to maintain a similar load of training (total minutes multiplied by her perceived level of exertion) when she's on snow and off snow,\" he says. \"Let's say in June, training would consist of a 90-minute strength session on Monday morning followed by an hour-and-15-minute energy system workout. Contrast that to January when we may do a two-and-half-hour on-snow training session followed by a 20-minute energy system workout.\"READ: Lindsey Vonn -- how to train like an Olympic championUS Ski Team member Breezy Johnson trains at the Center of Excellence in Park City, Utah.Among the other training devices Lackie uses are blood flow restriction bands, and \"shock absorbers.\" \"One training modality is blood flow restriction. This is like a tourniquet that we use on the tops of legs to slightly restrict blood flow. This gives the same sensation of legs feeling full when you get lactic acid build-up at the bottom of a run. We're essentially exacerbating that with the use of the bands.\"We also have a device in the Park City head office of the US ski team which is like two massive shock absorbers with a platform in between. The athletes bound up and down on it and the shocks suck all the energy out of the jump. It's incredibly fatiguing. You can jump laterally with little to no impact for maximal fatigue.\"We're trying to find movements that replicate the sport's movements instead of doing intervals on a bike or an ergo that don't necessarily replicate the positions you're going to be in while skiing. \"There is that mind-body connection so we want to make sure that what Mikaela experiences in preparation is what she experiences in competition.\"Shiffrin has won 41 World Cup races before the age of 23.Data gathering is also key. \"We use an app where Mikaela completes an online questionnaire after every session to assess her perceived fatigue and in addition looks at barbell velocity, lactate levels, heart rate and so on,\" says Lackie.\"We can track how many minutes training she's doing, for example when was the last time she ran a 65-second continuous downhill, when was the last time she trained any event in excess of 45 seconds, what's been the total minutes of slalom training in the past week or the total kg she has squatted. \"Just being able to keep track of all that gives me a lot of insight into where she's at and what we need to address.\"But Lackie warned: \"Coaches are very susceptible to seeing what we want to see. We have a confirmation bias like everyone else so we have to be cognizant of that, especially with someone like Mikaela. \"It's very easy to see what you want to see because she's such a phenomenon. She makes everything look easy but to extract the best performance out of her you need to be tracking the numbers.\"READ: Lindsey Vonn: I won't be representing US president at OlympicsThe training -- on the snowMikeala Shiffrin trains at the US Ski Team's  speed center at Copper Mountain, Colorado.In slalom, the exact gate configuration for that race is set on the day and skiers have a one-hour window for inspection, making training for specific tracks difficult. However, coaches try to replicate general conditions and test their racers across the whole spectrum of likely set-ups. \"To replicate the Olympic and World Cup hill preparation we use fire hoses and spray down the hill to saturate the snow to a wet slurry and then let it freeze,\" says Lackie. \"It becomes bumpy, hard and virtually impenetrable. That in itself requires a lot of coordination and strength just to be able to ski on.\"Depending on Mikaela's period of training we might set a full-length slalom and run eight repetitions or do 16-20 runs of a 20-25 second 20-30 gate slalom.\"The important thing is to train a variety of different course set-ups as that's the one factor we can control. We need to be prepared for everything, so we could set a really tight combination [of gates] or really fast delays (changes of direction). It's important not just to train the average but to train the ends of the spectrum to fully prepare Mikaela.\"Shiffrin is a triple slalom world champion and set for a second straight World Cup overall crown.  Technical tweaks are often made by Shiffrin's mother Eileen, who has been her long-time coach as well as friend, mentor, cook and nursemaid on the road.Her training regime continued throughout the Christmas period in Europe, with only Boxing Day off. It reaped rewards as she scored five straight World Cup wins in an intense fortnight, and seven wins in eight races from mid December in France, Austria, Norway, Croatia, Slovenia and Austria again.\"When you're over in Europe and away from home and family there's no sense in taking Christmas off, you might as well continue training,\" says Lackie.\"That's the difference between Mikaela Shiffrin and her competition.\" JUST WATCHEDSlalom ski masterclassReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSlalom ski masterclass 03:03To complement their downhill training -- including stints in Portillo, Chile in the summer, and sessions practicing gliding, aerodynamics and and jumping -- Shiffrin and other members of Team USA have taken their preparation into the digital realm with the use of 360-degree video. Headsets loaded with 360-degree views of downhill courses, such as the little-known Jeongseon venue in Pyeongchang, enable the skiers to train remotely and build up a mental picture of the racetrack.\"We've found it to be really promising,\" says Lackie. \"It helps athletes bridge that gap between visualizing and real-world experience.\"Shiffrin combined this technology with training full-length downhills at the Team USA training facility at Copper Mountain in November ahead of clinching her first ever World Cup downhill podium place and then the following day her maiden victory at Lake Louise, in only her fourth ever World Cup downhill race. The US Ski & Snowboard team are pioneering 360-degree video training at Park City. The mental gameShiffrin has earned a reputation as an ice-maiden who doesn't feel pressure. However, she admits the thought of disappointing other people is her biggest fear. \"That's where the external pressure comes into play, when I think, 'If I don't win I'm going to disappoint the media, or my fans, my family or my coaches or the people on my team who work so hard day in, day out to help me achieve my goals,'\" Shiffrin told CNN.\"But I'm starting to be able to separate the two and that's really important for me to be able to enjoy the sport.\"Shiffrin could compete in all five skiing disciplines in PyeongChang.For Lackie, it's Shiffrin's mind that is her biggest weapon.\"Strength alone is never going to win,\" he says. \"You need to have unbelievable mental fortitude to suppress nerves and execute your plan on race day.\"Downhillers are often intimidated by slalom because they feel the gates are coming at them so fast, whereas slalom skiers are intimidated by the sheer speed of downhill. Both require speed and agility but of a different kind.\"The ability to suppress fear is a key attribute in speed races. Some of the men's tracks can be super-intimidating. You can be conditioned better than anybody, and can have the best training, but you have to be able to suppress a lot of really good instincts and literally put your life in the line to be the best.\"The longer I do this the more I realize that, yes, fitness is important,  strength is important, but mental toughness, grit, all of that, is ultimately what makes or break an athlete.\"Mikaela's a standout because of her mental toughness and because of her perseverance. She's so deliberate about her training, there's never a wasted inch on the hill. Even skiing down to the top of a course she's refining her technique.Visit CNN.com/skiing for more news, features and videos\"She has loads of grit and that's why she's the best in the world.\"",

Canadian Ted-Jan Bloemen, who took gold in the men's 10,000m long-track speed skating, became the first athlete to be paid in virtual money when he struck a one-year sponsorship deal with ONG Social, a social network and crypto community, and CEEK VR, a developer of virtual reality experiences.It's often not easy being a Winter Olympian, particularly in securing financial support to fund the pursuit of sport success, with Bloemen is exploring a \"whole new frontier,\" according to his agent.The double world record-holder set an Olympic record of 12:39.77 at the Gangneung Ice Arena, edging out Dutch rival Jorrit Bergsma. He had claimed silver in the 5,000m a few days previously. Bloemen is sharing his Olympic journey on the ONG Social network and star in a 360\u00b0 virtual reality experience on CEEK VR.

In December, he broke Kramer's 10-year-old 5,000m world record by 1.5 seconds, once again in Salt Lake City. After that race, he controversially took the label bearing Kramer's name and world record-mark off the wall of the arena and broke it into pieces. At PyeongChang, the Dutchman finished sixth behind Bloemen in the 10,000m, but had previously bettered him in the 5,000m where Bloemen finished second.",

        "content": "(CNN)Some of the first modern settlers of Britain from 10,000 years ago had dark skin and curly hair, according to new analysis of a historic skeleton. The \"Cheddar Man\" fossil was discovered in 1903 in a cave in the village of Cheddar in Somerset, southwest England. He is the oldest complete skeleton to have been discovered in Britain, and would have been part of the last wave of immigrants to populate the region after the ice age.  Today's white Britons can trace their roots back to descendants of these people, and it was initially believed that \"Cheddar man\" had fair hair and skin.Now, after cutting-edge DNA analysis and facial reconstruction by a team of scientists from the Natural History Museum and University College London, it is believed he had blue eyes, \"dark brown to black skin\" and \"dark curly hair.\"  Photos: Ancient findsThis artist's illustration shows a young Purussaurus attacking a ground sloth in Amazonia 13 million years ago.

        "content": "Story highlightsSouth Korean-born Russian skater Viktor Ahn is among those bannedAthletes had hoped the court would force the IOC to invite them (CNN)Dozens of Russian athletes have lost an eleventh-hour bid to join the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) rejected their appeal. The appellants had asked CAS to overturn a decision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) not to invite them over doping concerns, meaning they won't be joining the 150 competitors cleared to compete as \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR).It will be a crushing disappointment to the Russian appellants, some of whom traveled to South Korea in the hope they would be granted the right to compete. One of the athletes' whose Olympic dream was ended Friday was Viktor Ahn, a highly decorated speed skater who was born in South Korea and competed for the country before becoming a naturalized Russian citizen. Viktor Ahn of Russia competes during the men's 1500m preliminaries of the ISU World Cup short track speed skating event in Dresden, Germany, on February 6, 2015.Russian official 'disappointed'Read MoreThe head of Russia's bobsleigh federation, Sergey Parkhomenko, said the decision had a \"political context\" and the group would be taking legal action.\"We're disappointed with the CAS decision... we believed in better but received this instead. We will file lawsuits in other courts demanding compensation for material costs. We'll go to the federal Supreme Court of Switzerland,\" Parkhomenko said, according to Russian state news agency TASS.Of the athletes and coaches whose appeals were thrown out Friday, 15 had previously had their lifetime bans for doping lifted by the Switzerland-based court. The IOC refused to invite them to Pyeongchang however, saying it had lingering suspicions, so they went back to CAS to try and overrule the Olympic body. In its decision Friday, the court upheld the IOC's right to exclude them, saying there was no evidence the IOC had \"improperly exercised their discretion.\"JUST WATCHEDIOC denies 15 Russians entry into OlympicsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHIOC denies 15 Russians entry into Olympics 01:50The IOC welcomed the decision in a statement, saying it \"supports the fight against doping and brings clarity for all athletes.\" Craig Reedie, President of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), said the \"timing of these decisions just before the opening ceremony in Pyeongchang is good as it will reassure athletes and others that only Russian athletes (who) have met strict anti-doping guidelines will be participating in the Games.\" Some of those athletes have already been in action. Though the Games don't officially kick off until Friday night local time, preliminary matches began in several sports earlier this week. In events Thursday and Friday, Russian curlers, ice skaters, ski jumpers and downhill skiers all took part in qualifying rounds, while many more athletes have been training on the Pyeongchang slopes and arenas. Marika\u00a0Pertakhiya, an Olympic Athlete from Russia, jumps during the women's moguls qualifying at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea on February 9, 2018.Widespread banRussia was banned from taking part in the Games in December after the IOC found the country had engaged in \"systemic manipulation\" of anti-doping rules, though Russian athletes who could prove they were clean were \"invited\" to compete as OARs. They will wear a uniform with that name on it, and the Olympic anthem will be played at any medal ceremonies for Russian athletes.But dozens of Russian athletes who had hoped to compete under the neutral flag were deemed ineligible by the world Olympic body. \"The list on which the Invitation Review Panel (IRP) based its considerations (on) covers a wide range of information,\" said Val\u00e9rie Fourneyron, the Chair of the International Testing Agency (ITA).\"It includes, for example, evidence of suspicious Steroid Profile values, DNA inconsistencies and irregularities of the Athlete Biological Passport, as well as evidence provided necessarily need to be transmitted to the athletes.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe IOC confirmed that only athletes who have \"fulfilled the pre-games testing requirements,\" including the IRP's criteria, \"as well as the required reanalysis from stored samples,\" would be allowed to compete at the Games.More than 150 Olympic Athletes from Russia are currently listed on the official Pyeongchang Games website. Last month Russian President Vladimir Putin admitted there had been \"instances of doping use in Russia,\" but said the issue was a global problem.Addressing supporters in Moscow, Putin said \"there were instances of doping use, true -- I want the audience to know this and the whole country to know this.\" But he added \"there are many such examples around the world, but no one is making a big show of it.\"CNN's Euan McKirdy contributed reporting.",

Taufatofua exceeded his own expectations, but even the ultra-confident Tongan momentarily allowed doubt to creep in.\"We had a goal to finish within 12 minutes ... and I did it in six,\" he recalls. \"I was so far behind all these professional skiers that I thought: 'wow, this is so hard, what have I gotten myself into?'\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 'Crazy story'Aside from trying to come up with the money to fund expensive skis -- Taufatofua has been using rentals for the last year -- plus flights and travel costs, the biggest challenge has been losing weight.Standing at more than 6 foot 3 inches, Taufatofu tipped the scales at 100 kilograms in Rio. He has since lost 15kg of fat and muscle, although he still weighs at least 20kg more than his competitors.But of all the difficulties in trying to master a new sport inside a year, nothing could have prepared him for his last race in Iceland in late January -- his final chance at qualifying for PyeongChang.Traveling with Chilean cross-country skier Yonathan Fernandez and Mexican endurance specialist German Madrazo, a giant snow storm meant Taufatofua's route to the race near \u00cdsafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur was blocked by avalanches.'If I get a gold medal, I'll be happy...''If I come last, I'll be happy...''I got Tonga to the Olympics'\"Yona from Chile, he's this military guy and he's like, 'You know what? We have to just go through the blizzard,'\" Taufatofua says. \"And so we end up driving for two days trying to get through this blizzard. \"We go eight hours, then we have to come back and try again but we had calculated exactly where those avalanches were and they were 20 kilometers out from the race.\"So we thought that if we could get to where they had blocked off the road, leave the car there and then hike, we could hike 20 kilometers through this blizzard to get to this race, it was our last chance. \"Luckily, on the third day we tried to get through, the roads had just been cleared so we managed to get on through and get to that last race.\"READ: 'I can motivate kids in Ghana to chase their dreamsREAD: Nationhood and the Olympics -- it's complicatedREAD: Olympian aims to get Eritrean on skisREAD: Know your luge from your skeleton'Impossible dream'His determination paid off, and with his final result and ranking points from roller skiing races, Taufatofua did enough to qualify for the Winter Games.  \"The dream this year was to qualify and to qualify in the year, that was the impossible dream -- I guess I'm going in without pressure,\" he says. \"I've come in as the last seed so I think I'm the last ranked person there -- so if I get a gold medal, I'll be happy; If I come last, I'll be happy. I made it to the Olympics and I got Tonga to the Olympics.\"Visit CNN.com/sport for more news and featuresAs for his Opening Ceremony attire -- or rather lack of it -- Taufatofua admitted the freezing temperatures were very much on his mind.\"I don't know if it's possible to beat that event, it was a Summer Games,\" he laughs. \"It's going to be minus 18 to minus 20, wind chill minus 25. \"I want to make sure that I can at least make it to my race and that I'm not frozen to death, so I have to stay warm at the opening ceremony.\"",

        "content": "Pyeongchang (CNN)Diplomacy and sporting endeavor mixed awkwardly at the spectacular opening of the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea, as sworn adversaries sat feet apart while North Korea received a welcome that would have been unthinkable just months ago.In a ceremony infused with themes of peace and harmony, South Korean President Moon Jae-in twice shook hands with Kim Yo Jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. US Vice President Mike Pence, sitting a few seats away in the same VIP booth, looked stony faced as the extraordinary scenes unfolded.The unprecedented encounter between the two senior Koreans fueled hopes that the Olympics could succeed where a generation of world leaders has failed -- to lay the groundwork, however tentatively, to a process of reconciliation on a peninsula that often appears one wrong move away from nuclear conflict.Minutes into the ceremony, as children skipped through a mythical landscape, Moon greeted Kim Yo Jong and  North Korea's 90-year-old ceremonial head of state Kim Yong Nam, the head of the North's Olympic delegation.Kim Yo-Jong applauds during the Opening Ceremony of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games.Kim Yo Jong, the first member of the North's ruling dynasty to visit the south since the end of the Korean War in 1953, smiled broadly as they shook hands. Read MoreThen, the two figures from opposite sides of a divided Korea watched as athletes from their respective nations marched together under a unified flag. Themes of peaceA giant dove lit up the sky, famous South Korean singers sang John Lennon's Imagine and, most significantly of all, athletes from North and South Korea walked in together for the first time in 11 years.The message was not subtle. Drawing on themes of harmony and unity, the ceremony gave Koreans hope -- whether or not it lasts -- that their nations, still technically at war, may one day find peace.The South Korean flag \"Taegeukgi\" is seen during the Opening Ceremony of the PyeongChang.The ceremony involved a starring role for the Games' mascot Soohorang, the white tiger, long been considered a protective guardian in Korean history and culture.In an elaborate finale, pre-taped for the TV broadcast to ensure nothing went wrong, more than 1,200 choreographed drones formed the Olympic rings in the sky.Soohrang, the white tiger, played a starring role in the opening ceremony.Pence looked uncomfortablePence, who has been vocal in his criticism of North Korea in the runup to the Games, sat impassive in the frigid February night, rising only when the US team entered the stadium.The US and North Korean representatives did not speak during the ceremony, and Pence did not attend an earlier dinner where he was due to share a table with North Korea's ceremonial head of state.Moon, however, welcomed Kim enthusiastically, greeting her warmly when she entered the VIP box and then shaking her hand again when North and South Korean athletes entered the stadium together.US Vice President Mike Pence (front R), his wife Karen (front C), North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un's sister Kim Yo Jong (2nd L) and Kim Jung-Sook (L), the wife of South Korea's President Moon Jae-in, attend the opening ceremony.The presence of Kim, who was promoted to the country's Politburo, the senior body of North Korea's communist party, as an alternate member last year, represents a hugely significant move in the thawing of relations between the neighbors.According to diplomatic sources, there is a \"good chance\" Kim will invite Moon to visit Pyongyang \"sometime this year.\"Fireworks explode during the Opening Ceremony of the PyeongChang 2018.While the sources say \"nothing is final,\" a visit by Moon to North Korea would be the first time a South Korean President has stepped foot in the country since 2007.That invitation could come when Moon and Kim will meet for lunch at the Blue House on Saturday, after the meeting was confirmed by a South Korean presidential spokesperson.

Follow @cnnsport\n\nEven on a brutally cold February evening, there were moments aplenty to warm the heart during a Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony which had peace as its central theme. \n\n\n\n\nLike writing in a stick of rock, the message that mankind can live in harmony ran through every dance routine, song and dazzling light show.South Korea's President Moon Jae-in described these Games as a \"festival and celebration of peace,\" and the competition's curtain-raiser certainly set the tone.The show of unity was not lost on International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach, who said North and South Korea had set a \"great example\" for sending \"a powerful message of peace.\"Read MoreREAD: Olympics Opening Ceremony as it happenedJUST WATCHEDHear Eileen Gu's remarks about representation after historic Olympic runReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH (15 Videos)Hear Eileen Gu's remarks about representation after historic Olympic runRussian figure skater's entourage under investigation40-year-old gold medalist returns home to a hero's welcomeSkier: My coming out story is my Olympic legacyHear athletes' reaction as Kamila Valieva cleared to compete Abby Roque: US ice hockey star's unconventional path to Beijing 2022Shaun White shares Carrot Top's advice that made him cut his hairFrom Olympic dream to quarantineBenjamin Alexander: From DJ to Jamaica's first ever alpine skierNathan Chen reacts to winning his first Olympic gold Nathan Chen credits iconic figure skater for inspiration after winning goldChloe Kim reveals biggest lesson she learned after 2018 Olympics'I don't even want to watch it': Gold medalist reacts to dad's viral interviewWill the Olympics make winter sports mainstream in China?Reporters press Eileen Gu over her citizenship. See how she respondsThe lead up to these Winter Olympics has been dominated by relations between two nations still technically at war. After a year of escalating hostility over Pyongyang's ballistic missile program, this Olympics has given the two countries reason to talk again. No matter how affecting the message of the host nation's first night, it would be fanciful to think that a sporting occasion such as this can bring about a truce between a Korea divided since 1953, but it was an evening filled with symbolic moments.As the Korean athletes marched together, President Moon shook hands with Kim Yo Jong, sister of North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un. She is the first member of Pyongyang's ruling dynasty to set foot in the rival country since the war.To add to the political intrigue, US Vice President Mike Pence, sitting a few seats away in the same VIP booth, looked stony faced as the ceremony unfolded.READ: Downhill daredevils -- how to conquer skiing's toughest eventJUST WATCHEDWho's who in North Korea's Olympic delegationReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWho's who in North Korea's Olympic delegation 01:07There were also selfies between North and South Koeran athletes as they waited to walk into the heart of the stadium.And when the Koreans emerged -- North Korea ice hockey player Chung Gum Hwang and South Korean bobsledder Won Yun-jong both held the flag of a unified Korean peninsula --  they were greeted to an ovation from 35,000 cheering spectators. Though this is not the first time athletes from the two countries have entered the Olympics together, it would take an extraordinary sporting feat to usurp the Koreans' march as the predominant moment of these Games. Indeed, the sporting spectacle that is to come has been overshadowed by this year's apparent rapprochement. Only a few months ago there were justifiable fears over whether Pyeongchang, roughly 40 kilometers from the border, could host these Games because of the North's nuclear proliferation.      The political road ahead is a long and complicated one, as protests in the region during the ceremony testify, but inside the Olympic Stadium the sentiment was largely of hope. Titled \"Peace in Motion,\" the ceremony began with a countdown, the ringing of a nine-meter-high \"Bell of Peace.\" Five children then appeared, taking the audience on a journey to the past, present and future. A white tiger, the Games' mascot Soohorang, long considered a protective guardian in Korean history and culture, guided the children to a cove where they were then transported to an ancient land.READ: Winter Olympics sport-by-sport guideFor TV viewers, augmented reality created a spectacular dome of constellations and stars above the performers before traditional Korean kites were then flown, a mural of the Four Guardians (symbols of ancient Koreans' hope for peace) was formed and 48 traditional dancers performed. Next came the spirituous thumping of drums -- 371 men and women beating Jangoos. Audience participation was encouraged -- spectators were given a small drum called a sogo -- which was perhaps a wise move given that the temperature dropped to a teeth-rattling -6C during the two-hour outdoor ceremony.JUST WATCHEDThe CNN ENG-KOR PyeongChang 2018 dictionaryReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe CNN ENG-KOR PyeongChang 2018 dictionary 02:19As well as diplomacy, the weather has been one of the other dominant topics in the build-up to an Olympics which is expected to be the coldest in more than 20 years.The 1994 Games in Lillehammer, where temperatures plunged to -2.7C (27F), holds the record, but the mercury is not expected to creep above zero during the first few days of competition in South Korea. While spectators wrapped themselves in the blankets provided and eked every bit of warmth from the multiple heat packs also provided, some athletes appeared to not feel the chill. Tonga's Pita Taufatofua repeated his topless flag-bearing from Rio 2016.Notably one-man Tongan team Pita Taufatofua, a cross-country skier who also competed in taekwondo at the 2016 Summer Games, caused a stir as he entered the stadium topless, just as he did in Rio, while Bermuda's athletes wore traditional shorts during the parade. READ: Tonga's famous flag bearer achieves 'impossible dream' This will be the largest Winter Games in history, with 2,800 athletes due to compete in a record 102 events, but even during the parade of nations it was not always about the competitors, as the focus of some spectators turned to President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un impersonators. Both were quickly ushered from the stands. Everyone's attention quickly returned to the center of the pentagon-shaped stadium, which will be demolished after these Games. A 77-year-old man, the oldest performer at the ceremony, sang Arirang, a traditional Korean folk song considered the unofficial anthem of Korea. As the time-traveling children returned to the present, having learnt a new secret to peace, a giant dove of peace was formed and singers sang Lennon's famous ode. On any other occasion, it may have been considered schmaltzy, but performed in a country still at war the performance resonated.

Admittedly, there are extreme sports, but none require the skill and dexterity required of the downhill racer.

There have been two official training runs from start to finish in the days leading up to the race. The track is so familiar, you could draw it blindfolded. But before the gold-medal run, there's an opportunity for a final inspection, a last chance to note the track's every bump and icy groove. Coaches will place themselves at specific points along the course. They will study the terrain, soak up information and pass it on. Teammates will also relay their findings. You are not alone. Yet. Teams go to inspects the course at Lake Louise.\"There's a lot of trust with the coaches and your teammates,\" says Nyman, who will not be competing in Pyeongchang after tearing his anterior cruciate ligament last month.\"It's an individual sport, but I don't think you can get as high as you possibly can unless you function as a group.\"Some competitors will make an appearance and quickly dash off. Others will inspect the course like an antiques dealer would a work of art. Former American Olympic great Bode Miller was quick, while two-time Olympic champion (though not in downhill) Hermann Maier would use the maximum time given. Norway's Aleksander Aamodt Kilde inspects the course in Wengen.\"I need to recreate feeling,\" explains Nyman. \"The feeling is like a tempo, like a rhythm of how the skis are going to react, how I need to move through the turn, how I need to flow.\"When I'm inspecting the course I see the turn, see where I need to move. Once I have that feeling, that will create vision and when I have a vision, that creates belief and I have that confidence to go harder.\"Jansrud, fifth in the men's downhill World Cup rankings and one of the favorites for gold in South Korea, also talks of evoking an image.\"You visualize the race a hundred times the whole week,\" says the Norwegian. \"You do the first training run, then you maybe do the second and you learn something new, hopefully experience will help too.\"READ: Why life is dangerous for Alpine skiersREAD: Vonn ready for \"full charge\" at OlympicsJansrud says he visualises the course more than 100 times in the week leading up to a race.Nerves, carbohydrates, changing moodsThe legs, strong through years of training, feel oddly week. It is around this time that you will start to behave differently. Nerves will take a stranglehold over the body and the mind.You've hiked up and down the hill, energy has already been exerted, and the race is a few hours away yet. Glory can only be achieved with the right fuel. \"It depends on the length of the day, the time of the race,\" says Nyman of his calorie intake on race day. The men's and women's downhill events in Pyeongchang start from 11am.\"In Wengen [a World Cup race in Switzerland which starts at around noon] I make extra sandwiches and I'll have cheese, egg and meat sarnies after the inspection. You have to keep your [energy] stores high, refueling the carbs is key.\"Nyman worries little about how much he eats on any given day. The more the better, he says, because \"mass is momentum.\" \"I use a lactate buffer. Your lactic acid levels get high as you're going down the hill, so I take a lot of sodium citrate to help not feel that burn. I always snack. I don't eat too much, but I always have a little bit of fuel.\"It is around this time that Jansrud, usually quick to smile, becomes serious. \"I'm in a different mood,\" says the 32-year-old. \"That's not something I do on purpose. That's the result of all the races you've ever done and you develop this way of handling it.\"JUST WATCHEDLindsey Vonn's dream for her late grandfatherReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLindsey Vonn's dream for her late grandfather 02:55Warming up, getting into the zoneThe stomach is tightening, but the body needs to loosen up. Out to the warm-up hill you go, gently gliding. It's a simple course, but it gets the muscles firing. For Nyman, there is a routine. With every practice run and inspection, he removes a layer of clothing, like a snake shedding its skin, until by race time he looks as sleek as a superhero. Nyman says he will wear big gloves during training, but aerodynamic ones during a race.\"I'll wear a baggy T-shirt, thick underwear, then I get tighter and tighter clothes, and more serious attire on,\" the Utah native says. \"For race day I have a tight undersuit underneath my suit so there are no wrinkles. Everything is smooth. It helps heighten my ability to focus. It helps bring me into the zone. It just puts me in that mental state, knowing I can be faster come race day.\"Thirty minutes before he'll launch downhill, Nyman sips a can of coke for a much-needed caffeine hit. \"The intensity of this endeavor requires high intensity,\" he says. \"You need that spike, but you need to time that spike.\"Mind games, focusing on the courseThis, after all, is a competition and there is no greater contest than a race for Olympic gold. \"Peacocking\" is not the reserve of 100m sprinters. Up in the hut where athletes will wait to be called to the start gate and cameras rarely peer, racers will attempt to gain a competitive advantage by planting seeds of doubt in a rival's mind.\"Some guys definitely play mind games,\" says Nyman. \"I know who those guys are, so I take their questions with a pinch of salt.\"I do some physical exercises on the top; prime the core, prime the legs. I get things going so when you kick out of the gate you're ready.\"Jansrud (left) shares a joke with Dominik Paris of Italy.Jansrud admits he can sometimes be the one playing the fool, but he also knows when to stop. Energy must be preserved for the monster in front of you. Everyone knows that their greatest competitor is the mountain itself. \"In downhill there's this respect for letting people focus the way they want to focus because the consequences of making mistakes or crashing can be potentially fatal,\" says Jansrud.\"I'll throw in jokes about bindings being loose, but that's much earlier on. You just don't do that the minute before you go. People crash when they're not focused, and you don't want to live with that. \"Outside the start house it's fun and games, but inside you give them the space they need.\"Finding your Zen -- it's a balanceThe heart is beating faster. Now it's serious. Different courses evoke different emotions. The legendary Streif in Kitzbuehel, where jumps can be up to 80m and slopes have a gradient of 85%, is a frightening prospect for even the greats. Jansrud at the start  in Val Gardena, Italy.The Gariwang mountain in Pyeongchang will not stir up such fear, though this is the Olympics -- the knees will be knocking.\"It's not a course where you're standing on the top thinking, 'oh crap' like in Kitzbhuel,\" says Nyman.In a few seconds, the clock will start beeping down from five. It's time to find your Zen. Nyman will chant a few key words to himself, Jansrud will practice breathing techniques. \"It's not nothingness, because it's everything but nothingness. But if I have to focus on something in particular then I'm not focused,\" says the Norwegian of his emotions seconds before he goes. \"Five to 10 minutes before the race, it's a process, coming to the spot where you want to be, which is aggressive but not stupid; you want to be calm but not nonchalant, you want to be focused. It's a balance. Skiing is about balance.\"Jansrud says downhill racers must not be too aggressive during a race.'An habitual motion of moving down the hill'You're on the course, a blur of speed whizzing down the hill. The turns are coming at you fast. You're carving, accelerating. There are big jumps on the Gariwang. You will have to turn according to the terrain, not the gates. But, so far, so good. You're in, what Nyman calls, the \"flow zone.\" \"It's that place where I can see the snow crystals,\" the 35-year-old explains. \"I can see where I need to place my edge, I can see how I need to move, where I'm projecting myself into blind areas. \"Those are some of the coolest moments I've had on skis because it's slow motion, you can zoom in and see this, and zoom out, and everything is almost effortless, an habitual motion of moving down the hill. It's amazing how much you see.\"Visit CNN.com/Sport for more news and featuresMissing a gate, botching a jumpNyman has competed at the 2006, 2010 and 2014 Olympics.But not every run can be blemish free. A gate can be missed, a jump misjudged. Do you panic and step on the accelerator? Or should you keep calm and continue with the original plan?You need to pull a big squat out of the bag to avoid crashing out. You've been squatting a minimum of twice your body weight (one and a half for a woman) to build up those muscles, but you've now used up a lot of your energy. No matter. You're still standing. Just.\"I usually curse and yell something,\" admits Nyman. \"Some of the coaches ask: 'why do you talk when you ski?' and I just say I'm just letting it out.\"When the skis are taking you for a ride, that's when you're tense.\" Injuries are part of Alpine skiing. Nyman was airlited after crashing in Wengen in 2017.\"There are a lot of guys who I know who were incredible ski racers and would make a mistake and panic and push harder and try to make up time, but you can't do that,\" explains Nyman. \"You're given what you're given. If you try to make up time you make more mistakes. You have to just limit the mistakes, do what you're capable of doing. \"If you make a mistake, you step back and have to generate speed from there. Every change in the hill gives you an opportunity to go faster. You have to constantly work every section and bring that speed to a maximum level. \"It's one solid movement from top to bottom, one consistent desire to continually build instead of totally nailing one section and messing up another section.\"Glory or disappointment?The crowd's roars have been silent to your ears so far but with the finishing line in sight you can detect their flag-waving cheers.  \"Twenty meters before the finishing line, on some courses you get this little moment of clarity, but in some races you don't because it's busy, busy,\" says Jansrud. Silver medalist Christof Innerhofer of Italy (left), gold medalist Matthias Mayer of Austria (center) and bronze medalist Kjetil Jansrud of Norway (right) celebrate at Sochi 2014. Congratulations! You've successfully negotiated a vertical drop of 825m (748m for the women). But will you be celebrated or become an also-ran? Green light or red light? Faster or slower than the rest? \"Sometimes you get a gut feeling, but it's not until you see the board, you know, which makes it an amazing experience,\" adds the Norwegian.You lift your skis in the air. Soak up the adulation. Olympic gold is yours. It wasn't that hard, was it? Unless you crashed and burned and are still untangling yourself from the orange netting.",

Among them, Nathan Chen, 18, is a favorite to medal as the figure skating competition began this week.For a minority group that hasn't had the highest visibility in American mainstream pop culture or sports world, their selection to the US team elicited a joyous response on the blog, Angry Asian Man: \"Look at all these All-American skaters going to the Olympics.\"In recent years, Asian Americans have gained increasing visibility in the sport. After Kristi Yamaguchi won gold in 1992, at least one Asian-American figure skater has competed in every Olympic since then.Read More\"I think we're seeing the rise of more diversity in our sport in the US,\" said Yamaguchi, who became the first Asian-American woman to win Olympic gold.

The \"Shib Sibs\" are from Ann Arbor, Michigan, and have never skated with any other partners.Hide Caption 6 of 6Diversity in skating During the 2017 season, 39% of the top US skaters in the men's and women's singles elite program were of Asian descent, according to Team USA. Meanwhile, Asian Americans represent about 5.7% of the US population.So why are Asian Americans excelling in this sport?21 Feb 1992: Kristi Yamaguchi of the United States looks on during the Olympic Games in Albertville, France.\"I don't know if there's any specific explanation for it,\" Yamaguchi said. One factor could be that the skating rinks and training centers are in places like the San Francisco Bay Area and Detroit where the pool of talent is more diverse, she said.After all, the 2018 US Olympic Team is the most diverse winter team on record with 10 African Americans and 11 Asian Americans, according to the US Olympic Committee. Torrey Sun, who is a biracial Chinese American, competed in the 1960s when figure skating wasn't very diverse. Sun says what's happening in figure skating could reflect diversity in general in the US.\"I think of some other comparisons like the diversity in the student body in college and university campuses, which is different compared to what it was like in the '60s,\" said Sun, who is now a university administrator. Nature and nurture?Audrey Weisiger, a Chinese-American former figure skater and now coach theorizes that a combination of factors can lead to success for Asian-American figure skaters, including a smaller physical frame. Weisinger said when she looked at the world champion men's medal podium, she noticed that they were around the same size. These Olympic figure skaters will blow your mind\"Men are doing quads, and if you're too big, you can't do it,\" she said. But being lighter has its drawbacks too, making them susceptible to injuries, she added.In addition to the physical demands of the sport, the support and resources for a budding ice skater is also critical. \"It's parents living in America, willing to do anything,\" Weisiger said. \"A lot of families invest everything and a lot of moms devote everything to their kids' careers.\" This characteristic isn't unique to Asian Americans, but Weisiger said she has noticed very dedicated Asian-American parents and heard a lot of stories about hard-working, immigrant parents who sacrifice for their children's training. And figure skating can be a very expensive sport.\"I find a lot of the skating moms are very driven and they want their kids to be successful,\" she said.JUST WATCHEDUS Olympic hopeful focused on PyeongchangReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHUS Olympic hopeful focused on Pyeongchang 02:59For one, Nathan Chen credits his mom for helping him. \"My mom spent most of my life with me on the ice, making sure that I was getting the right training in and doing all the right steps to do well in the sport,\" he said last month. \"I wasn't able to have lessons year round, she would stand on the ice, take notes of what the coach is asking me to do. And then after the coach left, she would continue training me, continue going over all those little things and she would ask the coach what specific things to work on, things that I could improve on.\" \"She made it really fun. She made a lot of games out of it and she just made me find my passion for skating at a young age,\" he said. Regardless of ethnicity or background, skaters say it's also about the mentality.\"Any athlete can be successful,\" Yamaguchi said. \"You need certain values of work ethic, perseverance, determination and focus -- for any athlete, no matter what your background is.\" Having a role model Another factor is representation. One of Yamaguchi's skating idols was Tiffany Chin, who won the 1985 US Figure Skating Championship title and finished fourth in the 1984 Olympics.\"I really looked up to her. I think unknowingly as a young athlete coming up, had a connection with her,\" Yamaguchi said. \"Seeing someone like you who's accomplishing things that you aspire to, means a lot.\"    Awwwww.  #Repost @yukisaegusa with @repostapp \u30fb\u30fb\u30fb How's this for #TBT.

This year could be historic for Asian-American males if Nathan Chen or Vincent Zhou medal in the men's singles competition. \"The two of them are just extraordinary. They're pushing the boundaries. It's an exciting time for sure for Asian-American men to be so prominently featured in the Olympic sport,\" said Yamaguchi, who'll be covering figure skating for NBC's digital \"Olympic Ice\" show.",

For others, the national flag on your kit is altogether more complicated.Follow @cnnsport\n\nThe 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang will feature 178 athletes who are competing for a non-native nation, about 6% of the total competing in South Korea, according to research by global mobility company CapRelo.     The US has experienced the biggest talent drain, with 37 American-born athletes competing for other nations, followed by 21 from Canada and 19 from Russia.Hosts South Korea are the biggest winners, welcoming 18 athletes from other countries followed by 13 to Canada and 11 to Germany.Alpine skiing features the most non-native athletes with 32, while figure skating has seen 26 changes of flag.Read MoreTwelve countries are represented wholly by non-native athletes, eight of which are single person teams, and three -- Nigeria, Kosovo and Eritrea -- are making their first appearance at a Winter Games as a result, according to the research.READ:  North Korean inclusion a 'positive thing,' says US skier star Ted Ligety'I can motivate kids in Ghana to chase their dreams' \u2014 Akwasi Frimpong'I skied for myself, not for my country'However, the bare statistics often hide the nuances.Nigerian skeleton slider Simidele Adeagbo was born in Toronto, Canada, while the Nigerian women's bobsled team -- the first from Africa to make the Games -- of Seun Adigun, Ngozi Onwumere and Akuoma Omeoga were all born in the US, but always felt a deep-rooted affinity for Nigeria. Adigun also competed at the 2012 London Olympics in the 100m hurdles for Nigeria. \"Being Nigerian was always something that was definitely prominent in my childhood, as it is as much as in adulthood. That was the first culture that I've ever known,\" Omeoga told CNN Sport.READ: Nigerian women's bobsled team make Winter Olympics history\n\n\n\n\nFor some athletes, switching nations is a necessity to maintain their livelihood.Former alpine ski racer Kilian Albrecht, who is now the agent for US star Mikaela Shiffrin, competed for his native Austria at the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City before switching to Bulgaria, for whom he competed at Vancouver 2010.Albrecht says he was frozen out by the Austrian team, despite still performing well enough on skiing's World Cup circuit, but he needed to compete for a nation to be eligible to stay on the tour.\"It wasn't about the Olympics for me,\" he told CNN Sport.\"I skied for myself, not for my country. I just wanted to continue my job as a ski racer and that wasn't possible so that's why I looked for an option and ended up skiing for Bulgaria.\"Albrecht says he had some detractors when he got his Bulgarian passport in 2006 and was accused of being a traitor in some quarters, but he insists he also had plenty of support, as well as phone calls from other athletes wanting to switch. \"Obviously it's controversial -- they say, 'well, he just switched nations because he was really bad,' which isn't true,\" says Albrecht, who still consults for Bulgaria and has been coaching the Mexican ski team since before the Sochi Games of 2014.     \"I saw it more as an individual sport and I tried to do the best for myself and the people who supported me rather than doing it for a nation.\"READ: Hockey sisters to represent US and KoreaOne of the Mexican team is US veteran Sarah Schleper, who has come out of retirement to race for her adopted nation after marrying Mexican Federico Gaxiola and acquiring citizenship in 2014.

For Albrecht, the anthem played for the gold medalist is just a mark of \"honor\" and \"celebration,\" and says it wouldn't matter to him which anthem was played. \"Most people might not understand that maybe, personally I don't get the whole anthem thing, the whole proud nation thing because I think we're all on the same planet.

He was offered full use of Italy's coaches and facilities in the sport, a job in the police force and eventual citizenship, but he was adamant he was staying with India despite the financial struggles and hardship of competing for a fringe Winter Olympics nation. \"For me the dream was to get the Olympics to my hometown,\" he was reported as saying in the New York Times. \"And that was the only reason I was doing it. To show that we are also here.\" Austrian skiing great Franz Klammer, the 1976 Olympic downhill champion, believes patriotism adds a whole different realm to competing at an Olympic Games.\"The pressure is enormous,\" Klammer told CNN Sport. \"You only have one shot every four years, and you're representing your whole country, it's not just yourself so that's why it is a different dimension.\" Photos: Ones to watch in the Winter OlympicsMikaela Shiffrin (United States): Shiffrin comes into the Winter Olympics as the most dominant female skier in the world. The 22-year-old is the defending World Cup champion, and she is already out to a big lead this season. In 2014 she became the youngest woman to ever win Olympic gold in the slalom, and she'll be looking to defend that title in PyeongChang -- and also add gold in the giant slalom.Hide Caption 1 of 17 Photos: Ones to watch in the Winter OlympicsSeun Adigun, Ngozi Onwumere and Akuoma Omeoga (Nigeria): Nigeria has never had an athlete compete in the Winter Olympics, but that will change in PyeongChang.

All three are former track-and-field stars.Hide Caption 2 of 17 Photos: Ones to watch in the Winter OlympicsSven Kramer (Netherlands): The Dutch are renowned for their speedskating, and Kramer is one of the most decorated athletes in the sport's history. He has won seven Olympic medals since 2006, and in PyeongChang he will be looking to win the 5,000 meters for the third straight Games. On the women's side, look out for Ireen W\u00fcst.

One of them is Medvedeva, an 18-year-old figure skater who has won the last two world titles and holds several world-record scores. She could be vulnerable in South Korea, however, as she recently recovered from a broken foot and finished second last month at the European Championships.

        "content": "(CNN)Listen, it's not breaking news. The Winter Olympics are going to be cold. But it seems like the games in Pyeongchang are shaping up to be really, REALLY cold. Could it be the coldest on record? While it's hard to really nail down the superlatives, the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, were supposedly the coldest games on record, with an unseasonably cold average high of 27\u02daF (-2.7\u02daC) according to Accuweather. (Lillehammer was also the farthest north the games have ever been, so that probably played a part.)The Opening Ceremonies of the 1994 Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway.How does that compare to Pyeongchang? On Friday at Bokwang Phoenix Park, where the freestyle skiing and snowboard events will be held, the low is predicted to be a brisk 3\u02daF (-16\u02daC). But remember, that's just a single place, on a single day. And of course, the park is located in a more mountainous region, meaning it will be colder. READ MORE: Follow the weather for the Olympic Games with CNN Storm Tracker Read MoreWhich brings us to the Debbie Downer part -- all of the variables mean the term \"coldest Olympics ever\" kind of loses its meaning. When the games are held at multiple locations over multiple days at multiple altitudes, it's hard to pin down any reliable comparisons. Similarly, some of the more remote locations for the games ever the years have incomplete weather records.So, again: Just trust it will be cold. The weather doesn't know it's going for any kind of record. It just knows it's gonna make your snot freeze to your face.Is it the coldest place to host the games? When you're looking at the average lows for February, Pyeongchang is definitely among the coldest at 13.1\u02daF (-10.5\u02daC). But three other cities have clocked in with colder average lows: St. Moretz, Switzerland, which hosted the 1928 and 1948 games, lays claim to the top spot with an average February low of 2.48\u02daF (-16.4\u02daC). The other two with colder averages are two-time host Lake Placid, NY and 1988 host Calgary, Canada. Lake Placid, one of the coldest Olympics locations. However, when you're looking at latitude, Pyeongchang is the coldest city in relation to where it is in the world. The city roughly shares a latitude with San Francisco; Richmond, Virginia; and Seville in the south of Spain. Not exactly historically cold places. But, we have geography to blame for the difference in climates. Areas like San Francisco and southern Spain are kept warmer by their proximity to oceans. The Korean Peninsula is close to the water, but the weather patterns are coming from west to east, meaning it's being more affected by the weather coming from the cold climates of China, Mongolia and Russia. South Korea is also an extremely mountainous country, which of course cools down the climate in the winter. Pyeonchang's coastal location, on the western side of the Korean Peninsula and near the Sea of Japan. Will it be the coldest in a while?Now that is a definite yes. These games are going to feel a lot colder than the last few (for all of you jet-setting serial Olympic tourists). That's because the last three games -- Sochi, Russia in 2014; Vancouver, Canada, in 2010; and Torino, Italy, in 2006 were the three warmest climates, on average, to host the games.

In November, his last-gasp try gave Jamaica the Rugby Americas North sevens title with a 28-24 win over Guyana in Mexico. The victory meant Jamaica not only qualified for a place at the prestigious Hong Kong Sevens for the second year running, but also handed it a berth at the Commonwealth Games on Australia's Gold Coast -- where it will be in a pool with rugby-proud nations England, Australia and Samoa.Jamaica has also secured a spot at the rugby sevens World Cup in San Francisco in July -- the first Caribbean team to qualify for any rugby World Cup.But to understand just how big an achievement this is, you have to understand where they have come from.'Mission Impossible'Think of Jamaican sports and you begin with sprint legend Usain Bolt and and a sonic boom of world-class athletes. Then there's cricket and soccer. Rugby union is unlikely to register, and for good reason.There are no rugby pitches on the island, and moves to grow the sport were initially met with inertia.Recently there has been a reliance on the Jamaican diaspora. The UK, where kids can pick up a ball as early as they can run, has proved a more fruitful recruiting ground than the island. Key figures are aware of the need to retain the essential Jamaican-ness of the group, but they know they must also capitalize on momentum.Jamaican team manager Hughton Campbell, surveying a training session at Finchley rugby club in London, acknowledges the hard work that has gone into developing the team known as the \"Crocs.\"JUST WATCHEDBehind the scenes at England Rugby's U-20 campReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBehind the scenes at England Rugby's U-20 camp 01:07READ: How to build the ultimate athlete\"To get this felt like mission impossible, really,\" he says. Campbell joined the Crocs in 2016 at the behest of former Gloucester and Worcester Warriors winger Marcel Garvey, who coached alongside James Bailey, now the boss of England women's sevens. To find new blood for the team, Campbell scoured the TV and the internet, as well as relying on a network of tipsters and mates of mates for recommendations.Hand-outs from BoltOne of Campbell's players is the thickset Tyronie Rowe, who was born in Jamaica. Rowe knows tough -- he is from one of Kingston's roughest areas and has worked on and off as a mortician since he was 13. He splits his time between Kingston and England's Midlands, where he has played rugby league -- a 13-man variation of the game with different rules. He has known what it's like to worry about where your next meal is coming from. He also saw a much younger Bolt handing out sports kit to Jamaican rugby players who had never seen such luxury. Nodding to the busy session taking place in Finchley, Rowe says: \"This is the easy bit.\"The Jamaican story has been building for the last 18 months or so -- at all levels of the game. New coach Marcus Blackburn, who previously looked after the Singapore sevens side, is instilling a new-found confidence.Five of the boys training with the Jamaica youth team at Finchley are from English Premiership club academies, while Campbell is also keeping track of five Jamaica-qualified girls playing for a team in Harringay, north London.\"Where we are now was a dream,\" says Campbell. \"But it keeps happening because we persevere. \"We have no budget, guys dig deep into their own pockets to help out, we do whatever we can.

The plan is to win hearts and minds in the homeland. \"Jamaica loves success,\" says Osborne, who has seen recognition grow quickly. He was nominated for the recent Athlete of the Year award on the island. Bolt has won it seven times, cricketer Chris Gayle is another previous winner. This year world champion hurdler Omar McLeod took the title. But rugby and Osborne were also honored on the night. After subsequently doing the rounds on the breakfast shows and sports channel chats, Osborne found people shouting \"rugby man\" at him on the street.With a smile he reveals another admirer.\"The other day in Jamaica I actually met with Michael Frater who was an Olympic Gold medalist -- he was in the 4x100m, record-breaking team at London 2012 -- and he's interested in picking up rugby.

Here are five.  Shannon-Obgnai Abeda, alpine skiing, Eritrea Read MoreAbeda is set to become Eritrea's first ever winter Olympian. And with that, the 21-year-old is the flag bearer, too.      He was born in northern Alberta, Canada, after his parents fled the Northeast African nation that borders Ethiopia, Sudan and Djibouti. Like many kids growing up in Canada, ice hockey was his first love. But his parents weren't especially keen.  \"I wanted to be a hockey player, but they decided against that, and thought skiing was a good activity for me to do,\" he told the BBC. \"My parents were too concerned about injuries (as) a hockey player.\"     He made the point that ski racers also rack up a lot of injuries. The knees are particularly affected, as Abeda knows first hand. The computer science student almost certainly wouldn't have qualified for the Olympics if he represented Canada yet he told the CBC he now intends to \"put Eritrea on the map.\"\"Right now my focus is to go to the Olympics, but afterward\u00a0I'd like to finish school, do some coaching and get the Eritrean community on some skis,\" he said.

READ: Kosovo sport puts country on world stageKent Callister, snowboard, Australia  Like it or not, Callister may forever be known as a relative of Vegemite creator Cyril Callister. According to the PyeongChang 2018 website, the latter was his great uncle. For those not in the know, the yeast extract spread was invented in Australia to rival a similar product -- Britain's Marmite -- and became a hit. So much so that the National Museum Australia lists Vegemite as a \"symbol\" of the nation.      \"In the 1950s, Vegemite spoke of Australian vitality and innocence,\" wrote the NMA. \"Today it provides a connection back to seemingly simpler times and is symbolic of the reverence for the ordinary in Australian culture.\"Kent Callister was born in San Diego to an Australian father, moved to Australia, then returned to the US. He chose to represent Australia after receiving a scholarship from its Olympic Winter Institute. Snowboarder Kent Callister is related to the Vegemite creator. The 22-year-old made a splash in Sochi four years ago, finishing ninth in the halfpipe and has been ranked as high as fourth although he is currently 43rd in the standings.

(CNN)It will be cold and colorful, dramatic and dangerous, exciting and emotional -- the 2018 Winter Olympics is set to burst into life in South Korea. Some events have already begun, but an opening ceremony full of pride, passion, tradition and most probably a bit of politics will get the PyeongChang Games officially under way Friday.  Follow @cnnsport\n\nNearly 3,000 athletes from 93 countries are set to compete in a record 102 events across 15 different sports from February 9-25. From the participation of Russian athletes in the wake of doping scandals, and icy Siberian winds potentially rendering it the coldest Games ever, to North Korea's inclusion and free condoms, here are five things to know about PyeongChang 2018.

And while US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un -- who have publicly traded barbs -- won't be at the opening ceremony, US Vice President Mike Pence and Kim's sister Kim Yo Jong will. That's potentially awkward -- Kim Yo Jong is officially blacklisted by the US Treasury Department. Pence is being joined by the father of Otto Warmbier, a US student who suffered brain damage in a North Korean jail and died when he returned home last year.

They will march together with the South Korea athletes at the Opening Ceremony under the Korean Unification Flag. According to South Korea's national news agency, it will be the 10th such occasion at an international sports event.

That number could rise depending on the latest judgement by the Court of Arbitration for Sport on more than 40 Russian athletes hoping to have their lifetime Olympic bans overturned. However, this week the IOC refused to invite 15 Russian athletes and coaches despite CAS lifting their bans.

PyeongChang is no exception. The cost of the Games is set to top about $10 billion, which includes the Olympic Stadium that will only be used for the opening and closing ceremonies.  The stadium is expected to be demolished when the Games are done, which at least means PyeongChang won't have one of those white elephants, such as Montreal's Olympic Stadium that was built for the 1976 Summer Games.The Olympic Stadium will host the opening and closing ceremonies.  Plans to convert stadiums into schools in Rio after the 2016 Summer Olympics never materialized. But if Brazilians are still waiting for the legacy of those Olympics to benefit them, former IOC president Jacques Rogge called Barcelona 1992, Lillehammer 1994, Sydney 2000, Beijing 2008 and Vancouver 2010 \"success stories.\"Assessing London 2012, he wrote: \"It may still be too soon to call them the greatest Games ever, but ask the same question again in 20 years and you might just get a 'yes.'\"READ: Norovirus hits Olympic security guards As of February 8, PyeongChang organizers said they had sold 856,000 tickets -- 80.1% of the total.

The start of the torch relay on Nov. 1 plus the opening of a new high-speed train between Seoul and PyeongChang has helped, organizers added. It will be cold! While athletes are used to competing in the cold -- be it outdoors or in -- fans will have to find ways to keep warm at PyeongChang's open-air venues. At the opening ceremony -- starting at 20:00 local time (06:00 EST) -- the temperature is set to range between 28F (-2C) and 23F (-5C),  according to the Korean Meteorological Administration's news conference Wednesday.There's no roof or heating at the Olympic Stadium so attendees will be given blankets, seat warmers and hats. 'I can motivate kids in Ghana to chase their dreams' \u2014 Akwasi FrimpongThe temperatures throughout the 17 days of the Games could make PyeongChang the coldest Olympics since Lillehammer, Norway in 1994, which experienced an unseasonably cold average high of 27\u02daF (-2.7\u02daC) according to Accuweather.But if that doesn't sound too bracing, you have to factor in the wind chill - freezing draughts blowing in from Siberia could regularly drop temperatures to as low as -13F (-25C).\"The Winter Olympics is supposed to be cold and I think we were able to host the Olympics because it's so cold here,\" said Sim.

        "content": "(CNN)Curling? Luge? Biathlon? We don't blame you if you don't know much about these sports. But the Winter Olympics are here.  And to be the Winter Olympics expert in the break room at work, you've got to do your homework. Here's everything you need to know about some of the Winter Olympics' lesser-known sports.CurlingNo one cares if you throw stones in curling -- it's kind of expected.What the Olympics calls it: \"A team sport played by two teams of four players on a rectangular sheet of ice.\"What we call it: People with brooms watching other people with brooms wave them in front of a stone as it slides down the ice. The basics: Two teams alternate throwing stones toward a circular target. The object is to get your stones closer to the center than your opponent does. Players move long-handled brushes or brooms back and forth to \"sweep\" the ice to guide the stones. Need more? Enjoy this educational video from the Canadian Curling Association, folks who know a little bit about hurling rocks on ice. Read MoreThe contenders: It's all about the Canadians. They're dominant in this sport (all that time in the cold and ice has its benefits), and they're expected to take the gold in the men's, women's and mixed-doubles categories. By the way, mixed doubles is making its Olympic debut in these Games. Players to watch: You're safe picking any Canadian, but beyond that, keep an eye on Sweden's Niklas Edin. He led the Swedes to the bronze in 2014 in Sochi, adding to his two world championships and six European championship. And then there's Norway's Thomas Ulsrud. He guided the Norwegians to a silver medal eight years ago in Vancouver. They may not do that well this time, but Ulsrud and his crew are worth watching for their colorful trousers alone.Viewing guide: You'll either have to stay up late or get up early to see a lot of this. Mixed-doubles curling debuts at midnight ET Wednesday on NBCSN. Team USA takes on South Korea in men's curling at 12:30 a.m. ET on February 13 on NBCSN. There's lots of women's curling taking place on Valentine's Day. You can watch the United States vs. Great Britain (just after midnight ET, NBCSN), Denmark battle Sweden (1:15 p.m. ET, NBCSN) and Great Britain vs. those Olympic Athletes from Russia (5 a.m. ET, USA).Skeleton Here's to not needing a windshield and still moving up to 60 mph -- on ice.What the Olympics calls it: It \"involves plummeting head-first down a steep and treacherous ice track on a tiny sled.\"What we call it: There's got to be a better way to get your thrills.The basics: Competitors hop on their sleds and hurtle themselves on top of the ice on a track that's between 3,900 and 5,200 feet long. They reach speeds as fast as 60 mph. And it helps to be slim; the sport's international rules say competitors and their sleds together can't weigh more than 254 pounds for men and 203 pounds for women. The fastest racer over a combined total of four runs wins.The contenders: Those in the know say Yun Sung-bin of South Korea should be standing atop the medal stand with the gold in the men's category (that'll make the hometown crowd in Pyeongchang happy), while Germany's Jacqueline Loelling is the woman to beat. If she pulls it off, she'll bring Germany its first gold medal in the sport.Players to watch: A pair of brothers from Latvia -- Martins and Tomass Dukurs -- will battle the field and each other. Tomass, competing in his third Olympic Games, has never won an Olympic medal, but younger brother Martin nabbed silver in 2010 at Vancouver and 2014 in Sochi. On the women's side, Canada's Elisabeth Vathje, fresh off a strong season on the World Cup race circuit, will try to get her first Olympic medal.Viewing guide: Skeleton events run February 12 through 18, with the gold medal final runs for the men airing at 8 p.m. ET on February 15 on NBC, and the women's gold medal final runs airing at 8 p.m. ET on February 17, also on NBC.Luge Luge is like the opposite of skeleton, because you're flying around laying on your back instead of your stomach. What the Olympics calls it: \"Luge riders hurtle down a slippery ice track at great speed, relying on reflexes for steering. ... However, they have no protection should they make an error.\"What we call it: See skeleton, aboveThe basics: It's pretty much like skeleton, except you're sliding around on the ice feet-first on your back, instead of laying on your stomach. The track's longer (just less than 1 mile for men and about three-quarters of a mile for women), the lugers reach faster speeds (as fast as 90 mph) and there's no weight limit.The contenders: Natalie Geisenberger won women's and mixed-team gold four years ago in Sochi, so, of course, she wants more in PyeongChang. Fellow German Felix Loch is one of the sport's all-time greats. He's won three gold medals and teamed up with Geisenberger in Sochi to win the gold in the team relay event.Players to watch: Canada's Alex Gough's a vet of the last three Winter Olympic games, but she's never won a medal. Her fourth Olympics just might be the charm, with observers predicting she'll get a silver. On the men's side, Austrian Wolfgang Kindl looks like he's in great position to nab his first Olympic medal. And Team USA might just be good enough to medal in the team relay.Viewing guide: You can watch luge events from February 9 through 15, with the men's gold medal final runs airing at 7 p.m. ET on February 11 on NBC, and the women's gold medal final runs airing at 3 p.m. ET on February 13, also on NBC. BiathlonWho wants to slosh through the snow with a gun strapped to their back? Apparently, a lot of athletes.What the Olympics calls it: \"Biathlon combines the power and aggression of cross-country skiing with the precision and calm of marksmanship.\"What we call it: Going for really long runs in the snow in your skis, then, when you're good and tired, lying down on the ground and shooting at stuff. The basics: A long time ago, deep in Scandinavia, people put on their skis and went hunting through the snow with rifles on their shoulders. And then some genius thought: This would make a great Olympic sport! And that's how the biathlon was born: part cross-country ski race, part shooting contest. The skiing part of this covers various distances; the shooting part can be done from either a standing or prone position. It's been part of the Olympics since the 1920s.The contenders: There's a dizzying number of events in biathlon, including: men's 10-km sprint, women's 7.5-km sprint, men's 20-km individual, women's 12.5-km mass start (where elbows might be your best friend) and the mixed relay. All you need to know is athletes from Germany and Norway dominate this sport, with Norwegian Johannes Boe predicted to win big in men's events. In women's action, the experts think Laura Dahlmeier of Germany could grab several medals, too.Players to watch: Fun fact: Biathlon is the only Winter Olympic sport in which the US has never won a medal. But that might change in Pyeongchang. Why? The biathletes Team USA is sending to South Korea are the most experienced group yet, according to Bleacher Report, and Lowell Bailey's performance in men's events in Sochi in 2014 was the best ever for an American.Viewing guide: Biathlon runs nearly every day of these Games, from February 10 through 24. Things kick off with the women's 7.5-km sprint, airing at 1 p.m. ET on February 10 on NBCSN. Other highlights: men's 15-km mass start, at 3 p.m. ET on February 18 on NBC and the mixed relay gold medal final, airing at 3 p.m. on February 20 on NBC.",

        "content": "(CNN)Tuesday marks 100 years since some British women were first guaranteed the right to vote. The Representation of the People Act was adopted in February 1918, eventually paving the way for universal women's suffrage in the country.Here's a look at how all women in the UK were eventually granted the vote and how it compares with the rest of the world. Women won the right to vote in the UK 100 years ago...But the landmark act only granted a sliver of the UK's female population the right to cast a ballot. Under the 1918 Representation of the People Act, women over the age of 30 who either owned land themselves or were married to men with property were given the right to vote.  Read MoreThe same act also dropped the voting age for men from 30 to 21. For the next decade, the number of women's suffrage campaigners grew as they demonstrated for equal voting rights under two main factions. Suffragettes organized under the National Federation of Women Workers at a demonstration in London in 1911.The Suffragists, a predominantly middle-class group of women, campaigned under traditional, non-violent forms of dissent, using peaceful tactics and demonstrations to collectivize under the law. The more militant Suffragettes took another approach to their campaign, executing hunger strikes, and carrying out arson and firebomb attacks to galvanize support.In 1928, under the Equal Franchise Act, women in the UK were granted equal voting rights, increasing the number of eligible female voters from 8 million to 15 million. How does the UK stack up against the rest of the world?      Like the UK, Austria and Germany also first gave way to women's suffrage in 1918.New Zealand was the first country in the world to secure women's voting rights under law in 1893. In 1902, some Australian women got the right to vote -- but the law excluded indigenous women from casting their ballots until 1967. In Europe, Finland became the first European country to introduce women's suffrage in 1906. Women in Switzerland were the last in Europe -- excluded from their voting rights until 1971. In 1929, Ecuador became the first South American country to grant women's universal suffrage. It was an optional right for women to exercise until 1967, when it became compulsory. Mongolia became the first country in Asia to grant women the vote in 1924. Following independence in 1947, Pakistan adopted universal suffrage for legislative elections -- with women granted the right to vote in national elections in 1956. Indian women were granted universal suffrage in 1950. Women's suffrage in Gulf States have lagged behind the rest of the world, with Oman the first to loosen the law in 1994, followed by Qatar in 1999. Bahrain changed their laws in 2002, followed by Kuwait in 2005. In the United Arab Emirates, the right to vote is limited for both women and men, but in 2006, around 6,000 citizens -- including women -- were able to cast their ballots. Saudi Arabia women voted in municipal elections in 2015, marking the first time they were allowed to cast ballots -- and run for office -- in the Kingdom. After 100 years of female suffrage in the UK, women are still under-represented in ParliamentAlthough some women in the UK have been casting their ballots for 100 years, female politicians remain a minority in elected positions of power.  There are more women members of parliament than ever before, but they still make up only 32% of the total 650 members of Parliament. In 2017, 208 female lawmakers were elected to the House of Commons in the General Election -- the most seats that women have held in the country's history. But it's progress. In 2015, the total number of women to become MPs in history surpassed the number of males in a single Parliament.When will women live #AsEquals with men?Globally, the UK ranks 39th for female representation in parliament. The United States ranks 99th -- with women making up less than 20% all lawmakers. Rwanda currently leads the world in terms of share of female legislators, with women holding more than 61% of positions in parliament. Bolivia, Cuba, Nicaragua and Sweden follow at the top, according to the International Organization of Parliaments. Graphic by CNN's Henrik Pettersson",

The Games get underway on Friday. Sweden defeated Korea 3-1 in Sunday's friendly, a decent result for the Korean team which have only had a few days to train together before facing last year's fifth-ranked team in the world. Korea and Sweden go head-to-head in a friendly match Sunday ahead of the Olympic Games.The match saw 23 South Korean ice hockey players join forces with 12 players from the North, dressed in uniforms emblazoned with the single word \"Korea\" over a map of the peninsula.The Korean team did not stand for either the North or South Korean national anthems. Instead, after the Swedish anthem, the Koreans played the traditional folk song \"Arirang.\" Athletes listen to Korean folk song \"Arirang\" during the friendly match.  North and South Korean women's ice hockey players (pictured warming up before the match) last played against each other in April 2017.

The athletes will compete in ice hockey, ice skating and skiing across five disciplines.While the decision to march into the opening ceremony and compete in women's ice hockey under one flag heralds a thaw in relations between North and South, observers have expressed concern that Pyongyang is still doing little to scale back its nuclear ambitions.2018 Winter Olympics: What you need to know\"Despite these overtures to improve relations with the South, North Korea has yet to show any intention to fulfill its international obligations regarding denuclearization,\" said South Korea's Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha last month. Joint US-South Korea military drills -- which infuriate Pyongyang and raise tensions on the peninsula -- have been suspended for the duration of the upcoming Olympics as a show of good faith, though they are likely resume following the competition.But North Korea plans to hold a military parade before the Winter Olympics begin, putting further strain on diplomatic relations with the South in the days ahead of the Games.Demonstrators face off outside first match As the Korean team prepared to battle Sweden at the Seonhak International Ice Rink in Incheon, anti-North Korea protesters faced off with pro-unity crowds outside.A protester rips up the North Korean flag outside Sunday's hockey match. On one side, up to 100 anti-North Korean demonstrators denounced North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and criticized plans for the two Koreas to march under the unified flag.Protesters described the Games as the \"Pyongyang Olympics\" -- referring to the North Korean capital -- instead of the Pyeongchang Olympics.\"It was really difficult for South Korea to get the opportunity to host the Olympics,\" said 54-year-old protester Choi Yong-suk. \"And now we are not even allowed to hold up our own flag. Instead, we have to cheer with the unified flag.\"South Korean peace activists perform a welcoming dance before the match. Meanwhile, pro-unity demonstrators held up Korean unification flags and signs that said \"Proud Korea, together we're stronger.\"\"I hope this joint hockey team can be the beginning of peace on the Korean Peninsula,\" said 51-year-old supporter Jang Soo-kyung.\"The Olympics is an event that's supposed to unite everyone beyond political and cultural beliefs.\"",

        "content": "Moscow (CNN)The Russian military has named the pilot shot down Saturday in Syria, opening an unusual window into Russian military casualties in the country.In a statement released Monday, the Russian Ministry of Defense said the aviator, Maj. Roman Filipov, managed to eject from his Su-25 ground-attack aircraft after it was hit by a surface-to-air missile in the northwest province of Idlib.After struggling to keep the plane in the air, Filipov bailed out in the vicinity of Tell Debes, a settlement held by Syrian militants fighting the government of Bashar al-Assad, the statement said.It said that Filipov held his ground as the militant fighters approached, exchanging fire with his sidearm. After being wounded, the statement said, Filipov blew himself up with a hand grenade as the fighters closed in on his position.Smoke billows from the site of a downed Sukhoi-25 fighter jet in Syria's northwest province of Idlib.Filipov -- described by the Russian military as an \"experienced pilot\" with previous service in Syria -- was not the first Russian aviator to be shot down since Russian President Vladimir Putin sent warplanes to back the Syrian government in September 2015. In November that year, a Turkish Air Force F-16 fighter jet shot down a Russian Sukhoi Su-24 attack aircraft near the Syria-Turkey border, sparking a confrontation between Moscow and Ankara.Read MoreRussian casualties cloaked in secrecyThe Russian government does not always disclose its casualties in Syria, sensitive to public reaction in the runup to Putin's bid for re-election in March.Ruslan Leviev of the Conflict Intelligence Team, a group that collects open-source information on Russia's military involvement in Syria, said Russian military officials will announce the death of a pilot, but may not always announce the names of Russian troops that are on the ground supporting military operations. The deaths of Russian military contractors -- widely reported to be on the ground in Syria, but not officially acknowledged -- are also not disclosed, he added. The Kremlin often downplays its ground presence in Syria, preferring to present its intervention as a largely bloodless air war.\"Russian military officials selectively announce Syria casualties, often withholding names or giving them only after the media do so,\" Leviev said. \"Private military contractor casualties are never admitted by the MoD.\"Much about Russian casualties in Syria appears obscured by military secrecy. Unlike the US Department of Defense, which releases the names of servicemembers who die in combat after next of kin are notified, the Russian government has not published a comprehensive list of its casualties in Syria. Estimates suggest that the figures run into the dozens, but accurate numbers are hard to come by. In December, the respected Russian business newspaper Vedomosti tried to extrapolate active-duty casualty figures based on insurance claims related to the deaths of service members. Those claims include combat- and non-combat deaths: In the case of Filipov, the Russian Ministry of Defense said it would \"provide all the necessary support and help to the parents and family of the heroic deceased.\"",

I'll be picking the coaches and the staff, but my experience comes from the last twenty-five years of being with some of the biggest clubs, being managed by some of the best managers, and playing with some of the best players in the game.\"When pushed further, Beckham reveals that a blend of international and home-grown talent will be combined to try and bring success to a city which hasn't had MLS representation since the Miami Fusion were drafted in 1998, but cut from the league just four years later.

Though there have been bumps in the road in making MLS in Miami happen for a second time, the main man of MLS has been taken aback by Beckham's business acumen. \"People would be shocked,\" Garber tells CNN. \"David has dug in to all of our operating manuals and all of our ownership agreements...David didn't want to be at the board table, and in the ownership partnership, and not have the same level of knowledge. For days and days on end, he sat in a conference room and poured over documents and he's been very diligent.\"At times, Garber speaks with what seems like a paternal pride about his newest owner, reflecting on the qualities that Beckham has exuded in his presence. \"He's a very special guy,\" Garber says. \"There's something so deeply authentic and humble about him that, combined with his great sporting credentials, and with this just enormous and professional focus and passion, he's been the driver of it. He was granted the right to have a team when he came in in 2007, and it took 11 years from the time he started until today.\"\"This is something that's been a dream for many, many years.\" \u23e9 https://t.co/Hz9tGFcvf6 #FutbolMiamiMLS pic.twitter.com/ahlrLo2b5A\u2014 Major League Soccer (@MLS) January 30, 2018\n\nAnd so, with the latest chapter in the book of Beckham now written, future pages will be centering around Miami. \"I'm just excited to be in this league and in this city,\" he affirms, noting that \"being on the stage today and being awarded the franchise officially by Don, the Commissioner, having my partners and owners up on the stage, having our family in the audience, and having the fans\u2014it's real and it's happening.\"Indeed it is.

Over on the women's LPGA Tour, Sung Hyun Park led the way with $2,335,883, less than 25% of what Thomas brought home.

Read MoreThe brainchild of Golf Victoria is the only event of its kind in the world, with men and women playing over the same course on the same week for the exact same share of a $793,000 (AUD$ 1.3 million) prize fund.After failing to attract sponsors to host a women's tournament for two decades, Golf Victoria combined with the men's event in 2012 and the unified version has blossomed ever since. READ: Blind golf champion redefines what's possible''We are often reminded by the public and players that it is one of the best tournaments they have ever been involved with and we want this to continue,'' says Golf Australia chief executive Simon Brookhouse.''Without both the men and women this would not be as easy. The public love to watch the finesse of the women's game and the strength of the men's which provides for a great tournament experience.\"This is why we love the @VicOpenGolf Fans can walk the fairways with the players! \ud83d\ude0d#OatesVicOpen pic.twitter.com/Gmv4i9agcJ\u2014 PGA of Australia (@PGAofAustralia) February 4, 2018\n\nBringing fan bases togetherCheyenne Woods, niece of Tiger Woods and one of the stars playing last week, is full of praise for such an event. Cheyenne Woods hold the Australian Ladies Masters trophy aloft in 2014.''I love it. I think that it's entertaining for the spectators to have the variety of groups that you can watch. It's still the game of golf but it brings two different fan bases to appreciate each other's sport,'' Woods said in quotes gathered by the Ladies European Tour. ''They do value the equality in both men and women's golf together. I think a lot of tours and sponsors can learn from that. You see it in the tennis game, just watching tennis the last few weeks, the Aussie Open. \"I think that hopefully in the next few years it will get more like this.''It's a sentiment shared with one of the leading male players at the tournament, Richard Green. \ud83c\udfcc\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83c\udfc6@minjeegolf \ud83c\udfcc\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83c\udfc6Simon Hawkes #OatesVicOpen pic.twitter.com/IpxohbIxWY\u2014 Oates Vic Open (@VicOpenGolf) February 4, 2018\n\n\"The Ladies European Tour players are a damn hard-working bunch of girls that deserve to have a job and there's got to be something that kicks it along a little bit again,\" said the Australian. ''Maybe this sort of format or idea, rolling alongside the men in some way, whether it be with the Challenge Tour, the European Tour or the Australian Tour, I think it's a great way to get extra interest in the game.\" Should more tournaments follow the example set by the Oates Vic Open?

        "content": "Story highlightsFoles, in his second stint with the Eagles, debated retirement in 2016He's the first player in NFL history to throw for and catch a touchdown in the Super BowlMinneapolis (CNN)Nick Foles winning Super Bowl LII MVP honors felt unthinkable on July 27, 2016.That's when Foles, having been released by the Rams, seriously considered hanging up the cleats.\"I think as people, we deal with struggles,\" Foles said Sunday night. \"And that was a moment in my life where I thought about it, and I prayed about it. I'm grateful that I made the decision to come back and play.\"Indeed.Foles, the first backup quarterback to win a Super Bowl since Tom Brady did it in the 2001 season, wasn't fazed by the spotlight. He was 28 of 43 passing for 373 yards and three scores as the Philadelphia Eagles upended the New England Patriots, 41-33.Read MoreEagles win first Super Bowl as Nick Foles has game of his lifeHe is the third quarterback to start and win the Super Bowl after starting three or fewer games in the regular season, joining Doug Williams (Washington, Super Bowl XXII) and Jeff Hostetler (New York Giants, Super Bowl XXV).\"It doesn't get any bigger than this, but I felt good, I felt calm,\" Foles said. \"I think the big thing that helped me was knowing that I didn't have to be Superman. I have amazing teammates, amazing coaches around me, and all I have to do is go play as hard as I could and play for one another, play for those guys and not look at the scoreboard, not look at the time. Just go out there and play. Don't worry about it, and came away with a victory.\"Foles also made it into the record books, becoming the first player in NFL history to throw for and catch touchdown passes in the Super Bowl. He estimates the Eagles had practiced the play, called \"Philly special,\" for about a month. Sunday night, just before halftime, practice paid off.\"I was like, 'Let's just run it,'\" Foles said. \"It was a good time, and the end was a little wider than I thought, so I was like, 'I really need to sell like I'm not doing anything.' And it worked. Trey (Burton) made an amazing throw, right on the money.\".@TreyBurton8 has a career #SuperBowl passer rating of 118.8.#FlyEaglesFly pic.twitter.com/KGTw4WBQ5v\u2014 Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) February 5, 2018\nIt's been a long journey for Foles, now 29. Drafted by the Eagles in the third round (88th overall) of the 2012 NFL draft, Foles spent the first three seasons of his professional career with Philadelphia. He had his breakout season in 2013, leading the Eagles to the NFC East title and a playoff appearance.But it didn't last. In March 2015, Foles was traded to the Rams for Sam Bradford and a 2015 fifth-round draft pick. That August, Foles signed a two-year extension through 2017.Then came the slide. Foles was benched for Case Keenum. The Rams made Jared Goff the No. 1 overall pick in the 2016 draft, which led to Foles and the Rams working out his release.Foles, then 27, had a decision to make. Was he ready to walk away from the game?He took a few days to let the emotions settle. He went on a fly-fishing and camping trip with his brother-in-law. He talked to his wife Tori. He talked with his family. He prayed about it. That's not surprising, as someone who plans to become a pastor after football.\"That was the greatest thing in the world for me, because it changed my perspective,\" Foles said after arriving in Minnesota for Super Bowl week. \"It changed my heart, and I realize how grateful I am to be here.\"Foles decided not to retire yet. Several teams called, but for him, there was only one real choice: He chose to sign as a backup quarterback with the Chiefs for the 2016 season, reuniting him with former Eagles head coach Andy Reid.

I knew that if I played for him, I'd give it one more shot -- that he could find the joy. If I had joy in there, he could bring it back out, and he sure did.\"Foles rejoined the Eagles in March, signing a two-year contract to back up the second-year Carson Wentz. Things were looking up in 2017. The Eagles were rolling.Then came Week 14 at the Rams, when Wentz suffered a torn ACL.Foles, though, was ready. He completed 78.8% of his passes, going 26 of 33, for 352 yards and three touchdowns in the Eagles' 38-7 win against the Vikings in the NFC championship game. And then came his Super Bowl performance, blowing away expectations even of Eagles' faithful.\"I'm so happy for Nick,\" Eagles head coach Doug Pederson said. \"A lot of people -- a lot like this football team -- a lot of people counted him out and didn't think he could get it done. I believed in him, the staff believed in him, and this whole postseason Nick has shown exactly who he is and what he can do and what he is capable of doing. He's well deserved of the honor, but I know that he would give credit where credit is due, and he had a lot of playmakers tonight make plays for him on both sides of the ball.\"",

He is on trial for charges related to a gunfight with authorities that preceded his arrest.Abdeslam is accused of attempted murder in a terrorist context and illegal possession of firearms, charges which carry up to 20 years in prison if convicted. The prosecutor is calling for the maximum sentence.His trial is expected to last a week. Abdeslam also is expected to face a trial in France on charges related to the November 13, 2015 terror attack in Paris. Read MoreThat night, men armed with assault rifles and explosives targeted six locations across the French capital, killing at least 130 people and wounding hundreds. The militant group ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack. Authorities think Abdeslam, a French national born in Belgium, drove the black Renault Clio that dropped off three suicide bombers near the Stade de France.Abdeslam is the brother of Ibrahim Abdeslam, believed to be the suicide bomber who detonated explosives near a caf\u00e9 on the Boulevard Voltaire the night of the November 2015 attack. 'I am not afraid of you'In court Monday, Abdeslam looked very different than the clean-shaven young man who appeared in his arrest photos. His beard was full and his hair was longer and combed back, according to CNN affiliate BFM TV. Fast Facts: 2015 Paris terror attacksAbdeslam had asked to be present at his trial. But he refused to stand or to answer questions, BFM TV reported, and even balked at confirming his identity when asked by the court, telling those assembled that silence was \"his defense.\"But Abdeslam did lecture the court about the treatment of Muslims by the justice system, reported BFM TV. \"What I see is that Muslims are judged in the worst way,\" he said. \"My silence does not make me a criminal ... I am not afraid of you, nor of your allies. I place my trust in Allah. I have nothing to add.\"Refusal to answer questions is a tactic Abdeslam has used before. In October 2016, some members of his legal team quit because he would not speak in court.CNN's Tim Lister and Paul Cruickshank contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Minneapolis (CNN)The Pro Football Hall of Fame has a large contingent heading to Canton, Ohio, later this year, as wide receiver Randy Moss, wide receiver Terrell Owens, linebacker Brian Urlacher, safety Brian Dawkins, linebacker Ray Lewis, guard Jerry Kramer, linebacker Robert Brazile and Bobby Beathard made up the star-studded class of 2018 elected on Saturday.The group was announced during the taping of NFL Honors, a two-hour prime-time awards special held at the Cyrus Northrop Memorial Auditorium at the University of Minnesota. The group will be enshrined in Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium in August.Moss is the first wide receiver to be elected in his first year on the ballot since Jerry Rice. In his career, which spanned 14 seasons, Moss had 982 receptions for 15,292 yards and 156 touchdowns and led the NFL in touchdown receptions five times. He also set the NFL record with 23 touchdown receptions in 2007 with the Patriots.\"I started this game at 6 years old and never imagined that I'd be here, putting on a Hall of Fame jacket,\" Moss said.Terrell Owens.Owens, a previous snub, made it in his third year of eligibility. He noticeably was absent from NFL Honors on Saturday, opting instead, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, to play basketball in Los Angeles.Read More\"He was very calm, very respectful and kind of humble about it,\" Pro Football Hall of Fame President David Baker said when describing Owens' reaction when he got the phone call.After a 16-year career, Owens finished with 1,078 receptions for 15,934 yards -- the second-highest yardage total in NFL history -- and 153 touchdowns, the third most. He also led the NFL in TD catches three times.Owens previously had voiced his displeasure at not being elected, tweeting this time last year, \"HOF is a total joke\" when he didn't get in. This year, though, Owens celebrated with a post on Instagram, reading, \"CONGRATS to the HOF CLASS OF 2018. We're GOLDEN!\"    CONGRATS to the HOF CLASS OF 2018. We're GOLDEN! \ud83e\udde5 A post shared by  Terrell Owens (@terrellowens) on Feb 3, 2018 at 3:01pm PST Lewis: 'I want to go fishing with a cigar'Lewis, a first-time finalist, played for the Baltimore Ravens from 1996 to 2012. He was twice named AP defensive player of the year and won two Super Bowls, earning MVP honors in Super Bowl XXXV.\"Now I can finally rest,\" Lewis said. \"I want to go fishing with a cigar now and just sit back. I don't want to work out every day now.\"Ray Lewis.Another first-time finalist, Urlacher spent his entire career with the Chicago Bears from 2000 to 2012. He won a defensive rookie of the year award and in 2005 was named defensive player of the year.\"I'm glad I didn't have to vote, because it would be really hard to pick,\" Urlacher said.Dawkins, in his second year of eligibility, was a safety with the Eagles and the Denver Broncos, spanning 16 seasons. He helped the Eagles to eight playoff appearances and was a nine-time Pro Bowler. He is the first player in NFL history to record a sack, interception, fumble recovery and touchdown catch in same game, when he did it against the Houston Texans on September 29, 2002.Dawkins called it \"extremely gratifying\" to be elected the same year the Eagles are in the Super Bowl.\"That's huge,\" Dawkins said. \"That goes above anything I can think about besides being able to now call myself a Hall of Famer.\"Kramer: 'It's something I was afraid to believe in'Kramer, a senior finalist, played from 1958 to 1968, anchoring the offensive line of the Vince Lombardi-era Green Bay Packers. The right guard is remembered for a key block that made way for Bart Starr's game-winning touchdown in the famous \"Ice Bowl.\" In his 45th year of eligibility, this was his 11th time as a finalist.\"There were 10 times I was waiting for a knock on the door that didn't come, so there wasn't a great deal of confidence that it was going to happen this time,\" Kramer said.The first time he heard a knock Saturday? \"It's the maid,\" he said. \"So we gather ourselves.\"Brian Dawkins.The knock from Baker came later. \"I was over the top,\" Kramer said. \"It's something I was afraid to believe in, was afraid to hope for.\"A first-time finalist, Brazile, a linebacker from 1975 to 1984 with the Houston Oilers, also was a senior finalist.

The beefed-up security adds to what was already a heavy law enforcement presence, with extra patrols in parts of the city that some 800 migrants still call home nearly 18 months after authorities dismantled the infamous \"Jungle\" migrant camp.Four shot and 18 injured in Calais migrants brawlThursday's violence highlighted the growing tension in Calais, where migrants arriving in the wake of a deal struck last month between Britain and France to speed up asylum processes have upset the delicate balance between migrant ethnic communities.The result, according to aid groups, has been more intense competition for smugglers who charge as much as $3,700 (3,000 euros) per person to get migrants across the English Channel. \"I don't think that the refugees really understand the politics, but they heard a rumor that some might get to the UK, and with desperate people, any hope at all is something that they jump at,\" Clare Moseley of the charity aid group Care4Calais said.Read MoreMigrants living in tents in February 2018 in Calais, France, rely on aid groups to survive.French authorities have vowed not allow the development of another \"Jungle\"-style encampment, where some 7,000 migrants -- including 1,200 children -- lived in tents and shacks for two years before it was dismantled in 2016. Since the migrant crisis peaked in 2015, European leaders have tried to limit the numbers of migrants making their way illegally through the continent. Though the numbers dropped -- 984,000 people were living without proper registration in the European Union in 2016, compared with 2.2 million in 2015, Eurostat reports -- throngs continue to arrive in Europe from Africa, the Middle East and South Asia.'Volunteers ... make Europe human'By Saturday morning, migrants in Calais were once again lining up for breakfast provided by humanitarian organizations. You're a Calais migrant: How do you escape the 'Jungle'?Ali, a 26-year-old man from eastern Ethiopia, explained that without them, the migrants would die. \"It is the volunteers that make Europe human,\" said Ali, who didn't want to give his last name for fear of arrest.Ali, who arrived in Italy in July, said conditions have gotten worse lately, with the police taking down the migrants' tents every few days, leaving them with nothing but the hope that volunteers will bring them fresh ones. Calais police declined to comment on the claim. With the migrants dependent on aid groups even for water, Calais has become hell on earth, Ali said. Ali said he stays because he can't afford to pay smugglers to get him to Britain but also cannot go to refuges provided by the French authorities because of the so-called Dublin regulation, a European Union law that requires asylum-seekers in most cases to apply in the first European country they enter.Migrants in Calais, France, camp out in February 2018. Many aim to make it to the United Kingdom to seek asylum. Returning to Italy would leave him without shelter or hope, Ali said. And returning to Ethiopia is also out of the question because of the persecution he said he faces as a member of the Oromo ethnic minority.Ali said it's been six months since he spoke with his wife or mother, adding that his father was killed in December. All he wants now, Ali said, is shelter and, at last, to be treated as a human being.",

CNN has reached out to Ramadan's lawyer for comment.Ramadan is a Swiss citizen who often has been featured by international media, including CNN, and whose grandfather, Hassan al-Banna, founded Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood movement.Read MoreRamadan wrote in an October post on Facebook: \"Unfounded allegations can never take the place of concrete truth. These accusations are simply false, and betray all the ideals I have long strived for and believed in.\"A statement in November by Oxford University said Ramadan \"categorically denies\" any wrongdoing. Ramadan took a leave of absence from Oxford in late 2017.Accusations date to 2009 and 2012Two accusations against Ramadan were filed in October, related to alleged incidents in 2009 and 2012, CNN affiliate BFM reported.The first woman to accuse Ramadan of rape is Henda Ayari, a former Ramadan follower who has since become a secular activist. She publicly accused him in a Facebook post and later told The New York Times she \"could not forget what happened to (her) that night with him.\"A second accuser, a disabled woman who has not been named, has also accused Ramadan of rape, BFM reported last month. \"If there are other victims in France or elsewhere, they now know that justice will take notice of what they have been through,\" Ayari's lawyer, Jonas Haddad, told Le Monde newspaper Friday.

More people were around than usual because it was Ramadan, and many Muslims were on their way to or from prayers, the CPS said.According to the prosecution, Osborne deliberately drove his vehicle into the group near Finsbury Park Mosque, fatally injuring Ali and trying to kill as many others as he could. Nine others were taken to the hospital with injuries suffered in the attack.Darren Osbourne was convicted of murder and attempted murder.A witness told the court that when Osborne was stopped from fleeing by members of the public, he said: \"I've done my job, you can kill me now.\"In his defense, Osborne claimed that a man named \"Dave\" had been driving the van and was responsible for the attack. But he was unable to explain why closed-circuit TV showed only one man leaving the vehicle, the prosecution said.The CPS said it had prosecuted the case as a terrorist offense because Osborne's actions were intended to advance a political purpose, expressed in a handwritten note found in the van he used and in comments he made to police officers at the scene.CNN's Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.",

Here's everything you need to know if you actually want to sound smart in between commercials and pizza bagel binges. Who's playing in the Super Bowl?Reigning Super Bowl Champs the New England Patriots will attempt a repeat against the Philadelphia Eagles. How many Super Bowls have the Patriots won?Read MoreFive, all under the seemingly-unbeatable team of Tom Brady and Head Coach Bill Belichick. What if Bill Belichick never smiles because a witch cursed him and the only way to temporarily break the spell is to win the Super Bowl and that's why he keeps trying so hard to win them? How many Super Bowls have the Eagles won? Zero! They have been to two, most recently in 2004 when they lost to ...hoo boy ... The New England Patriots. Okay. Who are the quarterb--TOM BRADY! Have you heard it's Tom Brady? It's Tom Brady, the 40-year-old human male; a living Black Mirror episode where an immortal football legend has his consciousness implanted in an avocado while timelord Bill Belichick's team of New England scientists scramble to renew his muscle pliability using every drop of water in the Hoover Dam. Tom Brady is as hydrated as a jellyfish and as strong as an organic, free-range bear! Tom Brady doesn't even know the word \"death!\" Or \"carb!\"T  O   M     B  R  A  D  YOh, and the quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles will be Nick Foles. Nick Foles. I am not familiar with that name.So, funny story:  While everyone and their deceased great-great-grandmother knows who Tom Brady is, Nick Foles is actually the backup quarterback for the Eagles. Tom Brady is a 5-time Super Bowl Champion and the Eagles aren't even starting their main guy! It's household name Nick Foles! First-string Eagles quarterback and Prince Harry's body double Carson Wentz tore his ACL earlier this season, and what looked like an unfortunate end to a promising postseason bid was actually the beginning of an underdog run for the ages, led by none other than the 29-year-old Foles. Now, they are deservedly in the Super Bowl, facing a very formidable and well-nourished foe. Wait, why aren't we referring to it as Super Bowl LII?The AP Stylebook, basically a bible to most writers and grammar sticklers, caused a minor crisis earlier this year when they announced the Super Bowl is properly referred to by the year it's played. So for instance, this year's Super Bowl LII should be the 2018 Super Bowl. One thing to note on the Super Bowl: Refer to it by the year played, not the Roman numeral. We'll refer to this Eagles-Patriots game for years to come as the 2018 Super Bowl. #apstylechat\u2014 AP Stylebook (@APStylebook) January 24, 2018\nPeople were incensed. \"We have been doing fine with Roman numerals for LI years so far!\" they cried. \"And we will continue to use them for the next C to come!\" Which of course, kind of proves the point. Quick, what year was Super Bowl XLII? If you didn't say MMVIII, ya lose. Wow, while that is interesting I still can't really get into it. Who should I root for? If you like \"winning\" the way Donald Trump says it, you should root for the Patriots. If you like \"winning\" the way Charlie Sheen says it, you should root for the Eagles. If you like consistency and the status quo, root for the Patriots. If you like literally anything other than the Patriots, or just want to see a plucky franchise finally get their due, root for the Eagles. If you don't like Philly or New England, you should root for Philly just to see something different. If you're a Patriots fan and that offends you, just go gaze at the five rings y'all have. We hear it's soothing. JUST WATCHEDPatriots star reads mean tweet before Super BowlReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPatriots star reads mean tweet before Super Bowl 00:54That's not convincing me. Give me some other miscellany upon which to make my judgment. If you like \"Good Will Hunting,\" \"The Departed\" or any given Wahlberg, Damon or Affleck, root for the Patriots. If you like \"Rocky,\" \"Philadelphia\"  (don't judge!) or Bradley Cooper, root for the Eagles. Clam chowder over cheesesteak ? Patriots. Liberty Bell over Boston Harbor? Eagles. To be fair, this year's matchup is an American history lover's dream. Boston Market? PATRIOTS.Philadelphia cream cheese? EAGLES. Grating yet endearing local dialects? Friend, you are looking at a win-win. Why are some Eagles fans wearing dog masks? Is football actually a cult? Other than being really upsetting to look at, Eagles fans (and players!) have adopted the dog mask look because they were heavily regarded as underdogs when they faced both the Atlanta Falcons and the Minnesota Vikings on their way to the Super Bowl. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHOkay, I'm gonna pick up some wings, pound a non-alcoholic beverage and WATCH THIS THING. Where is it? This year's Super Bowl will be held on Sunday, February 4, at US Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. ET, which means the game will be over at 4 a.m. the next day. If you can't tell by the longship out front, the Minnesota Vikings usually play here. That stadium looks cool but I bet a lot of birds die there. Sadly, they actually do. According to one report, the stadium the biggest bird-killer in Minneapolis. There are actually ongoing conversations about how to make the design more birdly-friendly since literally hundreds of them have lost their live smashing into the reflective exterior glass since the stadium opened in 2016. Sad for the ecosystem, and a truly hideous omen for the Philadelphia Eagles.  Minnesota seems a bit cold this time of year. It will be! The high in Minneapolis on Sunday is predicted to be a cozy 8 degrees, and the low is zero. As in no degrees. Isn't anyone concerned the players will freeze? Not in a figurative way, but actually freeze solid?Luckily, the NFL wouldn't subject players -- and fans -- to such an experience. The Super Bowl typically isn't held in cold-weather cities if the stadium isn't domed or enclosed, and it just so happens US Bank Stadium is the latter. Live look at an open-air Minnesota Super Bowl, probably. Back to the game. How can I watch it? If you have normal cable, you can catch the game on NBC or any NBC affiliate. If you want to watch on your computer or device, NBC is streaming the game online and through their sports apps. And, good news! If you want to stream the game, you don't even need a cable login. Just go for it. I hear Justin Timberlake's playing the halftime show. Will there be any \"wardrobe malfunctions?\"Can you believe it was 14 whole years ago that Justin Timberlake ripped off part of Janet Jackson's costume during their Super Bowl halftime performance, sending the FCC into a tailspin and changing the history of live TV as we know it? It all seems so quaint, so... antique. Don't expect a cheeky repeat though -- it was not the kind of weird moment that begs an encore.  Behold, the most scandalous half-second of TV ever. Weird moments? I love weird moments! Give me one more for the road. Well, here's an Eagles fan riding a dune buggy up the Rocky steps.

        "content": "(CNN)It's often viewed as the banner event of the Winter Olympics, and the epitome of daring downhill sports. But just how important is the men's Olympic downhill gold medal in the career of alpine skiers?After all, the Olympic downhill competition is a one-shot wonder, one two-minute run on a different track every four years. A lot of elements -- mood, form, luck, equipment, track condition, weather -- have to align on the day. Since Austrian great Franz Klammer's famous win in 1976, only Swiss Pirmin Zurbriggen (1988) has won downhill gold as favorite. A handful of recent Olympic champions have clinched gold without a single win on the World Cup circuit.No one has ever defended the title either, although Norway's Lasse Kjus and Switzerland's Peter Muller have scored back-to-back silvers.Read MoreAnd some big names have never won the Olympic downhill gold, such as Austria's Hermann Maier and Swiss Didier Cuche, the record five-time Kitzbuhel champion. Klammer, American Tommy Moe and Switzerland's Didier Defago tell CNN Sport the tale of their gold medal and the impact achieving the Olympic dream had on their lives. Franz Klammer -- 1976, InnsbruckJUST WATCHEDFranz Klammer reflects on careerReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFranz Klammer reflects on career 03:08The Austrian, known as \"The Kaiser,\" is arguably the most famous ski racer of them all.  His electrifying run to clinch the 1976 Olympic downhill title, under intense pressure as hot favorite, transformed him from national hero to global superstar.\"Skiing wise the most important victory is Kitzbuhel for a downhiller because in my opinion it's the most complete downhill,\" Klammer, 64, told CNN Sport.\"It requires everything -- guts, making tight turns, long turns, gliding sections, jumping. But for a skier, without the Olympic gold medal you are a good skier but not a great skier. It's as simple as that.\"READ: Why Arnold Schwarzenegger is transfixed by Kitzbuhel Klammer dominated the downhill scene in the year leading up to the Innsbruck Olympics. He had  beaten defending champion Bernhard Russi of Switzerland in the Olympic test event on the Patscherkofel course and was a 13-time World Cup downhill winner, including five wins at the start of 1976.The 22-year-old former farm boy went to his home Games with the expectation of a nation on his shoulders.\"If you're not the favorite and have a really good day it changes your life but if you win it as a favorite it's even more fun,\" says Klammer, whose strength and fitness came from working as lumberjack to pay for skiing in his youth, running uphill and downhill to get to and from work.\"The pressure is enormous once you're up in the starting gate. You only have one shot every four years and you're representing your whole country, not just yourself. That's why it is a different dimension.\"  Franz Klammer pulled off a famous victory with his Olympic win in Innsbruck in 1976.  Klammer had drawn bib number 15, the last of the top seeds to race, and a perceived disadvantage because the track conditions deteriorate and ruts develop. Archrival Russi had drawn Klammer's preferred starting position of three.The Swiss set a blistering time, which racer after racer failed to get anywhere near. At the top, Klammer was worried.\"I was struggling up there,\" he remembers. \"I said, 'Well, there's no chance. I will never beat Russi today, he's so much faster than everybody else.' For a short period of time he was about two seconds faster than anybody.\"READ: World's best heli-ski spotsBut then Klammer switched into race mode. In front of a raucous home crowd and the Olympics' first live TV audience, he produced one of the iconic moments of any Winter Games. In his skin-tight yellow ski suit, he flung himself down the Olympic run with cavalier abandon, arms and legs flailing as he rode the jumps and icy bumps, seemingly on the edge of control.\"Of course, I had confidence, but then when I walked into the starting gate I knew I would win the race. No matter what,\" he said.\"Whether I would crash or win the race there was no other alternative. I was pushing the envelope. I was going for it. You have to be ready to take risk. You have to try to earn the victory. I never thought about crashes.\"Halfway down he was aware he was \"pushing too hard\" but carved a trademark radical line into one of the corners to eke out more speed.\"It was probably my best turn ever and it paid off,\" he said. \"Nobody can do the perfect run, all you have to do is the fastest run.\"Klammer (left) edged out defending champion Bernhard Russi of Switzerland. He flashed over the finish line and the scoreboard ticked over to say he was the new leader from Russi by 0.33 seconds. The Swiss hugged Klammer and offered him \"the most sincere congratulations I'd ever had in my life.\"\"I was really relieved,\" said Klammer. \"Kind of a big stone fell off my heart. The pressure had been building up for a year-and-a-half for this one particular day.\"A career slump meant he didn't make the Austrian team for the 1980 Olympics and he was beset by equipment issues at Sarajevo 1984, finishing 10th. He ended his career in 1985 with 26 World Cup wins, including four at the legendary Kitzbuhel course, and two world titles.But of all the accolades, it was the Olympic title that stands out for Klammer.    \"It's one race every four years, that's what makes it so special,\" he said. \"They call me the 'Kaiser' and I still make a living out of the Olympics. \"Without the Olympic title I wouldn't be considered the best downhiller of all time, so for me it was very crucial. In my opinion I would have been a failure [without it].\"It has changed my entire life very positively.\" READ: Vonn reignites Olympic hopes with 79th winTommy Moe -- 1994, LillehammerTommy Moe won Olympic downhill gold in Lillehammer in 1994.He was the young American who pooped Norway's party and consigned home hero Kjetil Andre Aamodt to second place at Kvitfjell, but for Tommy Moe it was a victory waiting to happen.The 23-year-old, born in Montana and later raised in Alaska, was a child prodigy who joined the US ski team at 16 and made his World Cup debut a year later.  But going into to the Games in Lillehammer, he was still without a victory, although he'd scored three podiums the year before and was fifth at the worlds in Japan. \"I'd had some good finishes in the top 10 and I kept asking myself, 'when can I win, what's the deal?'\" he told CNN Sport from his base in Wyoming.READ: Stunning images from a color blind ski photographerAfter a week's rest in the Canary Islands following five straight weeks of competition in Europe, Moe arrived in Norway feeling refreshed.\"I knew if I skied my best I could get a medal,\" he said. \"The day of the race I felt super confident. I had a couple of practice runs and knew I was going to do something exciting.\"But that morning was funny because the night before my roommate Kyle Rasmussen was snoring and I couldn't sleep. I got up and moved to another bedroom but I still couldn't sleep -- I was so nervous and excited.\"Moe (center) downed local hero Kjetil Andre Aamodt (left) and Canada's Ed Podivinsky.Moe was motivated -- and \"pissed off\" -- by an article in US magazine Sports Illustrated which labeled Team USA's skiers as the \"lead-footed snowplough brigade.\"He was also concerned that attending the Opening Ceremony the night before was a bad move -- worried his competition were home and resting. But teammate Megan Gerety, who later became his wife, advised him to focus on his own performance, not who he might beat.With a bib number of eight, he remembered Gerety's words as he stood in the starting gate, staring down the Kvitfjell course.\"I just thought, 'hands forward, [weight on] outside ski,' That was my mantra,\" he says.\"On the course it felt like I was in slow motion. I felt like I was in a zone where I could do no wrong.\" JUST WATCHEDVonn: I won't represent Trump at Winter GamesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHVonn: I won't represent Trump at Winter Games 01:11Moe was behind at the first split but made up time with a blistering middle section including a massive leap off the Russi jump. Another huge spring off the bottom jump had Moe worried he might land outside the control gate, but he corrected and crossed the line 0.04 seconds ahead of  Aamodt, the 1992 super-G champion. \"I was so excited but it's brutal, like the most anxiety you can ever possibly imagine, hoping nobody beats you,\" he says. Nobody did. \"It was almost surreal because next day I woke up and thought it was all a dream,\" he added.\"I don't think any of other racers disrespected my win. They all knew I'd been pretty consistent in World Cup.\"Four days later, on his 24th birthday, a relaxed Moe took silver in the super-G to become the first American to win two skiing medals at a single Olympics.He took a call from President Clinton and was on the cover of the next Sports Illustrated.Moe: \"It was fun, but I definitely got sidetracked by some business and some partying.\"\"I went from nobody to somebody,\" he says. \"There was all sorts of press and sponsorship and business deals happening. All sorts of doors opened up.\"My life changed a lot after that. Everybody wanted an autograph or a picture. I liked some aspects of it, but I didn't like the stardom that much because I was a pretty quiet guy. \"There were certain things that made me grow up pretty quickly -- the money, the fame, the fortune, the partying, the women, everything. \"It was fun, but I definitely got sidetracked. I don't think I ever came back to being as good of an athlete.\"JUST WATCHEDMikaela Shiffrin's snoozy secretReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMikaela Shiffrin's snoozy secret 02:50Moe finally won a World Cup event with victory in a super-G in Whistler, Canada weeks after the Games in Lillehammer, but a downhill triumph eluded him.He spent some time out following a bad knee injury back at Kvitfjell in 1995, while a severed tendon in his thumb sustained while serving behind the bar on a raucous night in the infamous Londoner Pub after the Kitzbuhel race in 1997 cost him a shot at that year's World Championships, to the ire of his coach and the press. Moe retired after the 1998 Games in Nagano, where he came 12th in downhill and eighth super-G. \"My only regret is I didn't win more World Cup downhills just to back up my Olympic glory,\" said Moe, who splits his time between working as an ambassador and guide for Jackson Hole ski resort and the heli-ski lodge he co-owns in Tordrillo, Alaska. \"But I did pretty well for an unknown skier from Montana.\"If there is any race to win as an American it's the Olympic downhill. \"I could have won two or three World Cup downhills like Kitzbuhel or Wengen and in comparison I don't think anybody would have remembered my name compared to the Olympic downhill. \"Even to this day I go to events and get announced as Olympic champion.\"It has staying power.\"   Didier Defago -- 2010, VancouverDidier Defago was Switzerland's first men's Olympic downhill champion since Pirmin Zurbriggen in 1988.Dimple-chinned Defago was a regular on World Cup podiums but had only clinched his first downhill wins the year before, achieving the classic double of victories in Wengen and Kitzbuhel.But at the age of 32 in his third Olympics, the speedster from Morgins became Switzerland's first downhill champion since Zurbriggen 22 years ago. Defago's lightning-fast time was enough to keep out countryman Cuche, the favorite, as well as reigning World Cup champion Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway and American firebrand Bode Miller. He also became the oldest men's downhill champion, eclipsing France's Jean-Luc Cretier, who was also 32 when he won in Nagano in 1998. \"I was a little surprised, not to be on the podium but to win,\" he told CNN Sport. \"This season the Swiss team was very strong and we had to fight until the last training session to get in.\" READ: How punk 'anti-heroes' launched skiing's extreme generation  He added: \"I had just a strange feeling a couple of hours after the race. I was very happy, I was with the team and all the [ski manufacturer] Rossignol guys but I had a feeling of being alone. \"I had my wife and my father and my mother on the phone but it was a very strange feeling. They were in Switzerland, but my brother was in Vancouver. I got him on the phone and he said he was still working but he said he will try to come tonight for the prize giving. \"He didn't call again and I thought, 'OK, maybe he has no time to come up.' I was behind the scenes waiting for the prize giving and he just came in. \"It was a very emotional moment for me to share this part of the day with my brother.\"Defago was stunned by the \"crazy reception\" for him at home in Switzerland.Defago was stunned by the reception back in his home town in Switzerland's.\"We had a big hall and they also put up some tents and I said, 'you're crazy, this is too big, no one will come,'\" he said. \"It was a bad weather day also, but it was a crazy reception, with thousands of people there. It was incredible that so many people came to my town. A very nice moment.\"Defago won one more World Cup downhill in 2011 and finished 14th in his Olympic defense in Sochi in 2014. He retired in 2015 as a four-time Olympian with five World Cup wins and 16 podium spots in all disciplines.  \"I needed a lot of time to realize what I did and what it means to be an Olympic champion,\" he said. \"Now I've stopped the career and everybody says, 'this is the Olympic champion,' and you realize this has changed your life.\"I tried to stay the same guy. It's not every day easy but it's a part of my life.\"His advice to future Olympic champions? \"Enjoy it.\"",

The success of the Six Nations, which pits the Northern Hemisphere's best rugby sides against each other in February and March each year, is due in part to the competition's rich history.It dates back to 1871 and a single rugby game between England and Scotland. From there it has grown, with Ireland, Wales and France all added by 1910. The Five Nations endured until the end of the century, until the inclusion of Italy in 2000 saw the birth of the modern Six Nations.With one current coach calling it \"the best rugby competition in the world,\" needless to say excitement is high ahead of this year's tournament, which kicks off at Cardiff's Principality Stadium on February 3.

In the forwards, Joe Launchbury has proven to be a gritty performer; no player made more tackles over the course of last year's tournament. France2017: 3rdCoach: Jacques BrunelCaptain: Guilhem GuiradoThe past few years haven't been easy for French fans, and matters went from bad to worse last week when police raided the nation's rugby headquarters as part of an investigation into federation president Bernard Laporte.READ: What's behind France's 'disastrous' run of form?Embroiled in controversy away from the pitch, performances on it have also signaled cause for concern as Les Bleus lost all their November Tests, bar a draw at home to Japan. \"The results are extremely disappointing,\" captain Guilhem Guirado recently told CNN World Rugby.\"It's very difficult, especially as a captain. I'm so frustrated about this autumn tour [in November 2017] which was a disaster, honestly.\"Last year saw the sacking of coach Guy Noves, who led France to just seven victories in 21 games. He's been replaced by former Italy boss Jacques Brunel, who has named a youthful squad for this season's Six Nations.Captain Guirado is the only player with more than 50 caps. The hooker is at the heart of a pack that isn't short on size with the likes of lock S\u00e9bastien Vahaamahina tipping the scales at close to 280 pounds (127 kilograms).

Victory over Jones' side in the final game wrecked England's grand slam bid (five wins from five) in the process.\"It's always open, there's always a couple of results that throw things up in the air,\" said coach Joe Schmidt. \"England have got in front of everyone in the last two championships. It's up to the rest of us to try and chase them down.\"A win in Paris on the first weekend would set Ireland up nicely ahead of home games against Wales, Scotland and Italy. The Irish, as ever, have plenty of forward firepower. READ: Should Georgia be included in the Six Nations?CJ Stander carried the ball into contact more times than any player (103) during last year's tournament and even grabbed a hat-trick against Italy. More of the same will be required given the absence of fellow British and Irish Lion Sean O'Brien in the back row. Winger Jacob Stockdale is an exciting prospect. He recently admitted he almost quit rugby as a teenager because he was too small; he's now 6\"3' with pace and power to boot.JUST WATCHEDMeet Ren-G: The 2019 Rugby World Cup MascotReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMeet Ren-G: The 2019 Rugby World Cup Mascot 00:49Italy2017: 6thCoach: Conor O'SheaCaptain: Sergio ParisseItaly will be desperate to avoid the so-called wooden spoon -- a sixth-place finish -- for the third time in four years. The Azzurri went winless throughout 2017. Their most memorable performance saw them baffle England by deploying an innovative technique at last year's Six Nations whereby players didn't commit to rucks. It was criticized by some, strongly defended by coach Conor O'Shea, and forced World Rugby into a rule change.\"It's a tough competition but we're just looking to improve year on year,\" said O'Shea ahead of his second Six Nations with Italy. \"Gradually, little by little, we have to become more competitive. Our job is to be the best we can be and on any given day something special can happen.\"READ: Italy coach defends controversial tacticWith the likes of Georgia and Romania knocking at the door to be included in the tournament, Italy, a side not short on experience, has a point to prove.Sergio Parisse (129 caps), Alessandro Zanni (99 caps) and Leonardo Ghiraldini (89 caps) make up the Azzurri veterans.

Wales2017: 5thCoach: Warren GatlandCaptain: Alun Wyn JonesWhile all teams have their injury woes, none has felt the bite quite like Wales ahead of its first game against Scotland in Cardiff.Last year's Lions captain Sam Warburton is the most high-profile absentee, but center Jonathan Davies has been arguably just as valuable in recent times. Scrumhalf Rhys Webb, No. 8 Taulupe Faletau, and fly-half Dan Biggar are also amongst those also sidelined for opening games.This means there are first-team places for the likes of uncapped winger Josh Adams and fly-half Rhys Patchell who has impressed for club side Scarlets. There are, though, familiar faces fit for Wales, namely lock Alun Wyn Jones, a veteran of 113 caps, who leads an injury-ravaged side desperate to improve on last season's fifth-place finish.Visit cnn.com/rugby for more news and videos \"Everyone's in the same boat, you've always got half a dozen players who are not available for whatever reason, for injuries and that,\" said Warren Gatland, who returns to his position as Wales coach after leading the British and Irish Lions last year.\"It's a great chance for younger players to take their opportunity with both hands, step up and maybe get a chance to be a star in what's probably, in my opinion, the best rugby tournament in the world.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Doping bans on 28 Russian athletes were overturned on Thursday, throwing the International Olympic Committee's policy on Russian doping into chaos just over a week before the start of the Winter Olympics in South Korea.The Swiss-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) upheld the appeals of athletes given lifetime Olympic bans for doping violations during the 2014 Sochi Winter Games, saying there was insufficient evidence to show they had broken the rules.The ruling means that athletes' 2014 results are reinstated and they could now seek to participate in the Winter Games in Pyeongchang, which open on February 9.Russian cross-country skiing star Alexander Legkov , who won gold at Sochi 2014, is among those whose bans were lifted.\n\nIn a further 11 cases, CAS ruled that doping violations had been committed but that lifetime bans were not justified and the punishments were cut to a ban for the 2018 Games alone.The IOC said the decision \"may have a serious impact on the future fight against doping,\" and added that it could yet appeal the decision at the Swiss Federal Tribunal, the country's highest court.Follow @cnnsport\n\nRead MoreAmong the reinstated athletes were cross-country skiing gold medalist Alexander Legkov, men's skeleton gold medalist Alexander Tretiakov and women's skeleton world champion Elena Nikitina.Aleksandr Zubkov, the double Olympic bobsled champion and Russian flag bearer in Sochi, is among the 11 whose doping bans were upheld.Russia's Alexander Tretiakov won a gold medal in the men's skeleton.It was not immediately clear if any of the 28 would seek to take part in Pyeonchang. To be eligible to compete in South Korea, they would need to be cleared by the IOC Invitation Review Panel and subsequently selected to join the team of 169 Russian athletes competing as neutrals,. The IOC banned the entire Russian team from the 2018 Games for a \"systemic manipulation\" of anti-doping rules. Russia denies the charge.  The Kremlin said it was \"very happy\" with the decision. \"This information about the CAS decision regarding our athletes confirms that active efforts to protect their rights in courts and in other ways are justified, they can be effective and they must continue,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on a conference call with journalists. Elena Nikitina, who had her appeal upheld, won bronze at Sochi 2014 in the skeleton.The IOC said it had noted the CAS decision with \"satisfaction on the one hand and disappointment on the other.\" But it also said that the decision did not necessarily mean that the 28 athletes who had their appeals upheld would be eligible to compete in Pyeongchang.\"The result of the CAS decision does not mean that athletes from the group of 28 will be invited to the Games,\" read the statement.\"Not being sanctioned does not automatically confer the privilege of an invitation.\"'Get out of jail free card'The decision by CAS, based in Lausanne, Switzerland, was also criticized by the lawyer of former Russian anti-doping official Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, who was forced to flee to the US after becoming the main whistleblower in the scandal.JUST WATCHEDRussian doping: 'Institutional conspiracy'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRussian doping: 'Institutional conspiracy' 01:39His claims were documented in the landmark McLaren report into Russian doping, which was published by the World Anti-Doping Agency in December 2016.\"This panel's unfortunate decision provides a very small measure of punishment for some athletes but a complete 'get out of jail free card' for most,\" Jim Walden, Rodchenkov's legal representative, said in a statement.\"Thus, the CAS decision only emboldens cheaters, makes it harder for clean athletes to win and provides yet another ill-gotten gain for the corrupt Russian doping system generally, and (Russian President Vladimir) Putin specifically.\"Read: Russian doping report alleges 'institutional conspiracy'The McLaren report found that more than 1,000 Russian athletes had benefited from doping.

When that did not prove possible, he drove around the city looking for a mosque, it said.  Just after midnight, he saw a group of Muslims helping 51-year-old Makram Ali, who had collapsed at an intersection. More people were around than usual because it was Ramadan, and many Muslims were on their way to or from prayers, the Crown Prosecution Service said.Read MoreAccording to the prosecution, Osborne deliberately drove his vehicle into the group near Finsbury Park Mosque, fatally injuring Ali and trying to kill as many others as he could. Nine others were taken to the hospital with injuries in the attack.A witness told the court that when Osborne was stopped from fleeing by members of the public, he said: \"I've done my job, you can kill me now.\"In his defense, Osborne claimed that a man named \"Dave\" had been driving the van and was responsible for the attack. But he was unable to explain why closed-circuit TV showed only one man leaving the van, the prosecution said.Osborne will be sentenced at a later date.Flowers and tributes lie at a police cordon near the scene of the Finsbury Park attack.The Crown Prosecution Service said it had prosecuted the case as a terrorist offense because Osborne's actions were intended to advance a political purpose, expressed in a handwritten note found in the van he used and in comments he made to police officers at the scene.\"Darren Osborne planned and carried out this attack because of his hatred of Muslims,\" said Sue Hemming of the Crown Prosecution Service.\"He later invented an unconvincing story to counter the overwhelming weight of evidence but the jury has convicted him. We have been clear throughout that this was a terrorist attack, and he must now face the consequences of his actions.\"The Muslim Council of Britain welcomed the guilty verdict.\"The scenes we witnessed last summer were the most violent manifestation of Islamophobia yet in our country. We cannot be complacent and regard this as a one-off terrorist incident,\" Secretary-General Harun Khan said in a statement.\"We heard during the trial how Osborne was motivated by anti-Muslim groups and Islamophobic tropes not only prevalent in far-right circles, but also made acceptable in our mainstream.\"CNN's Bharati Naik contributed to this report.",

Standing out were the visits to his grandfather, who passed away last year.\"Some of the great memories I had as kid were coming here and milking cows with my grandpa,\" Brady recalled of life on the farm. \"Hanging out in the silos up in the haystack up above his barn, going out to where he would pasteurize the milk and pull a lot of the cream off the top of the milk in the morning, and shooting his .22 at targets in his backyard.\"There was also catching sunfish with his two uncles, who still live there, a process Brady gladly explained to reporters this week.\"The great part about catching sunfish was you just sit in the boat and you have a rod and you basically put a worm and a bobber,\" Brady said. \"And when the bobber goes under, you set the hook and then you've got the fish. So the kids would catch all the fish, and then we'd get home and we'd scale the fish. Then my uncles would fillet the fish, and my mom and my grandma would fry them in the frying pan.\"As he moved into adulthood, Brady had the opportunity to play in front of family members in his collegiate days, when he was at the University of Michigan, and in his professional career.Nick Foles goes from mulling retirement to Super Bowl LII starting quarterback\"Any time we've played in Minnesota it's always been very cool,\" Brady said. \"I've always had a lot of family come to these games, 50 to 100 people. We played against the University of Minnesota, we played against the Vikings a few times here, and it's been very special. I know there's a lot of fans in Browerville rooting for the Patriots, which is pretty unique.\"This trip to Minnesota, however, is all business. Brady said he wouldn't have a chance to get to Browerville this week as he prepares for the Super Bowl. As for tickets, they're pretty tough to come by, Brady said, \"but I'm trying the best I can to accommodate everybody.\"Someone who definitely will be there is his mom. Last year, Galynn was battling breast cancer when she was at Super Bowl LI in Houston. This year, Brady said, she's doing well.\"To have my mom here last year -- I had my whole family here -- was very, very special,\" Brady said. \"Even all my kids here for the first time at the game, and we get a chance to do it a second time.

They had been hospitalized in a critical condition since the attack.These are all the countries that are expelling Russian diplomats\"I'm pleased to be able to report an improvement in the condition of Yulia Skripal. She has responded well to treatment but continues to receive expert clinical care 24 hours a day,\" Dr. Christine Blanshard, Medical Director for Salisbury District Hospital, said in a statement. Sergei Skripal, 66, remains in a critical but stable condition but Yulia is \"improving rapidly,\" the statement said. The Skripals were found slumped on a bench in an outdoor shopping complex in Salisbury, England. They had no visible injuries, according to police.Read MoreThe update on Yulia's condition comes a day after police said they believed the Skripals first came into contact with the nerve agent at Sergei Skripal's home in Salisbury.Front door pinpointedPolice have identified the highest concentration of the nerve agent to date as being on the property's front door, London's Metropolitan Police said.\"Traces of the nerve agent have been found at some of the other scenes detectives have been working at over the past few weeks, but at lower concentrations to that found at the home address,\" the police statement said.Police believe the Skripals first came into contact with the nerve agent at Sergei Skripal's home in Salisbury, pictured on March 6.Detectives plan to focus their investigation around Sergei Skripal's Salisbury home for the coming weeks and possibly months, the statement said. Yulia was visiting her father at the time they were poisoned.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday again demanded the UK give Russian diplomats access to Yulia as he announced that the country will shut down the US consulate in St Petersburg and expel 60 US diplomats.The tit-for-tat move came after more than 20 countries, including Canada and 18 EU member states, joined the United States in expelling more than 100 Russian diplomats over the nerve agent attack. The UK has expelled 23 Russian diplomats over the attack, which it blames on Moscow. Russia denies it was involved and has suggested the UK could be behind it.UK Prime Minister Theresa May called the worldwide backlash the \"the largest collective expulsion of Russian intelligence officers in history.\"Russian Foreign Minister spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters in Moscow that Britain is breaking the international law by refusing to provide information on the case.\"We are witnessing obvious prevention of access for Russian representatives to Russian victims,\" she said.Russia: 'Absurd position'Russia again denied any involvement in the poisoning on Thursday. Zakharova accused the UK government of seeking to \"bring about a totally absurd situation.\"How Vladimir Putin's arrogance handed Theresa May a diplomatic coupZakharova  said the countries which had ordered expulsions had been subject to intense pressure to show \"solidarity\" with Britain despite there being no evidence implicating Russia.Zakharova also repeated a Russian complaint that its requests for information in the Skripal case have been ignored. \"London is not giving us information and they cannot prove their innocence,\" she said.UK officials believe the Skripals were exposed to a Soviet-era nerve agent known as Novichok.But Zakharova said nerve agents have been produced in countries outside of Russia and pointed towards the United Kingdom, United States and the Czech Republic as countries which have invested in this type of research.Meanwhile, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that Russia welcomed reports that Austria -- which has not ordered the expulsion of Russian diplomats -- had offered to mediate between Russia and the United Kingdom in the Skripal case. \"In the situation with the UK any role, any voice that will spur the British vis-a-vis to, let's say, adequacy in this matter, is in demand, of course,\" Peskov said, when asked about Austria's reported offer to mediate.Thomas Schnoll, spokesman for Austria Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl, told CNN that Austria condemned the Skripal poisoning but wanted to keep channels of communication with Russia open. \"We see Austria as a bridge builder between the West and the East,\" he said.CNN's Zahra Ullah, Carol Jordan, Darya Tarasova and Lorenzo D'Agostino contributed to this report.",

The international friendly between Nigeria and Serbia was an important staging post for both teams as they finalize preparations for the tournament.Just down the road in north west London, England were hosting Italy in a friendly that drew a crowd of 82,000 at Wembley, but the game between Nigeria and Serbia was lower key, barely half filling The Hive stadium with a crowd of 5,100. But the fans in attendance still generated a lively atmosphere.It would be a tough game, the Nigerian side not only hadn't lost a game since last June, it also boasts a strong sense of team spirit.\"They've got such a simple blueprint of building the team unity,\" Nigerian fan Michael Oshineye told CNN Sport before the game. \"We use that word quite a lot but it's probably the best phrase to explain what we have right now.\"The start of a new era?Read MoreFor Serbia though, fans have grown disillusioned with the team's failure to qualify for any international tournaments since 2010. However, this years World Cup qualification marks the start of a new era for Serbian football -- and for the first time in a long time, morale among fans is high.Serbian fans arrived at the stadium proudly wearing Serbia's colors of red, blue and white.\"We've got the strongest team and the strongest men,\" one Serbian fan, Alex Saveljic, boasted.KO | The second half is underway at The Hive, it's 0-0 between Nigeria and Serbia pic.twitter.com/qOzk8EHGoH\u2014 Barnet FC \ud83d\udc1d (@BarnetFC) March 27, 2018Strong the players may be, but since qualifying -- and with less than three months left before the tournament in Russia begins, Serbia's management is still experimenting and establishing not only it's tactics, but itself as a team.And while that may not entirely be a bad thing -- as Nigerian coach Gernot Rohr says, matches like these act as a \"laboratory\" for coaches to test players and systems ahead of the World Cup -- but for Serbia, some of its recent changes have been questioned by fans. We've got the strongest team and the strongest men.Serbian fan, Alex SaveljicJust three weeks after successfully leading the team into qualification Serbia's coach, Slavoljub Muslin, was sacked and replaced with former footballer, Mladen Krstajic. Muslin was criticized for not injecting fresh blood into the team -- especially the likes of talented Lazio midfielder Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, who's turned heads with dominant displays in Italy.\"The change of manager happening right now is very strange,\" Football Association intermediary, Michael Di Stefano says. He once worked with the Yugoslavia national football team before the nation's dissolution. \"There's a lot of politics. A lot of people say in Serbia that Muslin was fired because he didn't give Milinkovic-Savic a chance to play on the team.\"Not only has Serbia's coach changed since qualifying for the World Cup, but when Krstajic took the reins, he shook things up even more and stripped Branislav Ivanovic of his long-term captaincy and announced that former Manchester City defender Aleksander Kolarov would take his place.It was announced in March that former Manchester City defender, Aleksander Kolarov would take Ivanovic's place as captain.\"Say whatever you want about Ivanovic, he's been a good professional,\" Di Stefano says.\"These changes really shouldn't be happening so close to a World Cup. In theory it should be a team that qualifies for the World Cup should be the team that carries through to the World Cup because they had a long way to come back from.\"Since then, Krstajic has led the team into two friendlies as part of the team's World Cup warm up, but failed to secure a win against Morocco on March 23 after experimenting with the team's formation. It left fans feeling concerned about all the recent changes.Serbia's national team players at the World Cup qualification match against Georgia back in October, 2017.Milos Dusanovic, who runs the Twitter account @SerbianFooty says it's worrying that Krstajic still isn't sure what he wants to do and is experimenting so close to the tournament.\"It would be great to have some consistency. Hopefully the team can mesh and adapt to a new system before June.\"Serbia falls 2-1 to Morocco. A frustrating night for Serbia as we struggled to find cohesion and flow in the game.

Fans leaped over the barriers and ran onto the field, on a mission to get selfies with the players. Serbian fan, Biljana Ptrovic told CNN Sport after the match that she thought the team's performance against Nigeria was the best they could do.\"I was especially happy that Mitrovic scored two spectacular goals,\" she said, wrapped in Serbia's flag. \"He's my favorite player!\"  She said that improvements had been made since their last friendly against Morocco.\"On their previous match they didn't click very well... so they tried a couple of different things and it worked much better tonight and let's hope that's the spirit they will carry on for the World Cup.\"Krstajic hit back at critics during the after-match press conference: \"They showed plenty of character against Nigeria and the display made it clear the critics were hasty in their remarks after the Morocco defeat.\"(Tonight) made it clear the critics were hasty in their remarks after the Morocco defeat.Serbian coach, Mladen Krstajic\"We controlled the game from the first minute and didn't give them any chance of play,\" he told reporters.\"Despite the fact that these are friendly matches and the score is not the most important thing, we come from a very specific country, Serbia, where every match is looked upon as a final and as such it was very difficult to motivate the team after the match where we lost unfairly against Morocco.\"But, the guys showed character and proved they are ready to play for the national team. We are moving forward, an important job is ahead of us.\"Krstajic also weighed in on Mitrovic and his winning goals.\"For me personally it's a great pleasure to have a player such as Mitrovic in our squad and it's a pleasure to train him because he's a killer up front which proved today.\"Aleksandar Mitrovic celebrates his second goal during the International Friendly match against Nigeria.Nigeria, however, were somewhat thankful for their first loss in over six months.\"I'm smiling because it's good for us to lose a game,\" coach Rohr said. \"If we won again today my players and some people will believe that we will be the world champions, so it's good to lose a game.\"Stand-in captain Ogenyi Onazi also told reporters that the friendlies have been important in building the team.\"We've learned a lot and there's still a lot for us to still do ... We're getting closer to exactly what we really want to do and in time we'll be prepared and know how to face our opponents (in the World Cup).\"How far can Serbia go?While all Serbian fans are hopeful, when asked how far they realistically think the team will go, most say they're just grateful the team has finally qualified once again.In June, the team -- which is currently ranked 34th in the world by FIFA -- will compete in the group stages against Costa Rica, Switzerland and finally Brazil -- the toughest of the three.We haven't taken part (in the World Cup) in eight years, so for us it's a privilege.Serbian fan, Biljana Ptrovi\"If you want my honest opinion I don't think we'll go far,\" Ptrovic said. \"But taking part at the moment is important for us because we haven't taken part in eight years, so for us it's a privilege.\"Dusanovic from @SerbianFooty shared the same opinion: \"Fans have low expectations since we've been disappointed so often before. \"The Serbian national team is very unpredictable and most people are just hopeful that we will pass the group. That would be a big achievement for us.\"Most Serbian fans say they're grateful the team has finally qualified for the World Cup once again.In order to advance out of the group stages Dusanovic says, Serbia needs to learn how to work together.\"We need to play as a team and employ a system that works or we will pack up early and head home with another disappointment.\"For Di Stefano, though, while it's too early to tell, on paper the Serbian side is promising.\"You look on paper and I expect the team to be in the last 16. If they weren't in the last 16 the football gods have screwed everybody, because on paper that's where they should be.\"JUST WATCHEDThe 2018 FIFA World Cup Draw in RussiaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe 2018 FIFA World Cup Draw in Russia 03:00The team that could have accomplished it allFor now, though, he just hopes Krstajic reminds the team of their history.

        "content": "(CNN)By any measure, Thursday was a momentous day for Australian cricket. It started with a choked-up mea culpa by rookie fielder Cameron Bancroft over his role in a ball-tampering scandal that has rocked the nation before snowballing into a tearful, wrenching press conference by former captain Steve Smith, before ending with the resignation of the coach, Darren Lehmann. The bloodbath came after three Australian players -- team captain Smith, vice-captain David Warner and opener Bancroft -- were banned after admitting to ball tampering during the third Test match in the team's series in South Africa. After getting caught sandpapering the ball on camera while on the pitch, the three co-conspirators owned up to the deed, before returning to their home country and, in the case of Smith and Bancroft, making emotional pleas of forgiveness to the waiting media.   The 48-year-old coach said he made the decision to join his players in exile after talking to his family and watching the tearful scenes at Perth and Sydney airports, where Bancroft and Smith, respectively, faced the cameras and the nation.Read More\"After viewing Steve and Cameron's hurting, it's only fair that I make this decision,\" said the 48-year-old Lehmann, who will quit after the fourth Test, which started Friday.\"I'm ultimately responsible for the culture of the team,\" he said.\"This will allow cricket Australia to complete a full review into the team and allow them to implement changes to regain the trust of the Australian public.\"JUST WATCHEDWhat's ball-tampering -- and does it even work?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhat's ball-tampering -- and does it even work? 01:21Week of reckoningAs the teammates of Bancroft, Smith and Warner take to the pitch at the New Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg for the fourth and final Test of the series, the country is experiencing a rare moment of introspection for its most decorated and best-loved national team. Roger Oldridge, a Network Ten cricket commentator, says there's been a \"staggering public outcry\" over the revelations of cheating. \"We know our team plays hard but we like to think they play fair. In Australia, the cricket team is the pinnacle of our national sports -- the captaincy is considered, parochially speaking, to be the second top job behind the Prime Minister,\" he told CNN. \"To see the captain and the vice-captain to be a part of cheating is gut wrenching.\"Former captain Steve Smith of the Australian Cricket Team departs at O.R. Tambo International Airport after being caught cheating in the Sunfoil Test Series between Australia and South Africa.Former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said that the country's belief that it plays tough but fair is why its sports-obsessed inhabitants are so invested in the scandal.\"For more than a century the Australian nation, the Australian people have prided themselves on sportsmanship, they've prided themselves on being the land of the fair-go... the land of fair play and suddenly that gets torpedoed amidships by this extraordinary action by these players,\" the former premier told CNN.\"What on earth was on their mind that could have caused them to conclude that this was even possible, let alone that they could get away with it?\"Not cricket: How Australia cheating scandal harms national psycheSympathy emergesHowever, Oldridge says that, in the middle of the emotional roller coaster, public opinion has shifted in favor of Smith and Bancroft. \"The public wanted blood, but last night there was a shift when we saw the raw emotion (exhibited in the two players' public appearances).\"These guys are broken, they know they've done wrong.\"An emotional Smith confronts the media at Sydney International Airport on March 29, 2018.Jon Pierik, a cricket journalist at the Age newspaper in Melbourne, says that he believes that the players' emotional outpourings were genuine. \"Smith looked a young man lost, gutted. It didn't take much for him to well up. He knows what he's lost, not just the dollars. It's far more than a job to him.\"While some, including Aussie cricket legend Shane Warne have called the sanctions too extreme -- a year for Smith and Warner, nine months for Bancroft -- Pierik thinks the lengthy bans are necessary for Cricket Australia to clean house and regain credibility. https://t.co/Tfml6wIvpo\u2014 Shane Warne (@ShaneWarne) March 28, 2018\n\n\"I think punishment is fair, if it was six months they'd barely miss a game. There's so much at stake, in terms of sponsors dropping off, Cricket Australia needed to take a stand.\" Australia's Steve Smith resigns as captain of IPL's Rajasthan RoyalsTearing the cricket establishment up by the rootsPierk argues that a root-and-branch review of the international team set-up needs to be aggressively implemented. He says that it's time to review the entire organization, from Cricket Australia executives and the board, down through the team management and the players, and that the personality of the team needs to be changed through changing the personnel.He says that the team has been given tacit approval to push the boundaries of what is acceptable on the cricket pitch, and that under outgoing coach Lehmann have been playing with a \"hostile nature,\" with Warner as \"the attack dog.\" \"You can't play sport without a bit of aggro but it's got way out of control, this win-at-all-stakes (attitude). If you change the personnel you'll change that aggro style of play out there,\" he says. \"This (scandal) is just massive. Millions of dollars have been lost.\" He says that Lehmann's decision to step down was \"definitely right thing to do\" as his position became untenable. \"You can't have captain, the vice-captain, another player gone, and talk about changing the culture of the team (while remaining in the job). They've had that certain style of play, pushing the line, (and Lehmann) never got them to rein in it.\" Smith congratulates  Warner and Bancroft on day four of the First Test Match of the 2017/18 Ashes Series between Australia and England at The Gabba on November 26, 2017 in Brisbane, Australia. Redemption down the line? While the harrowing experience has shaken the notoriously sports-mad country to the core, commentators believe that at least two of the three cricketers can bounce back to regain their place in the nation's affections. \"Smith and Bancroft are mentally tough, it'll take a lot for them to rebuild, but I wouldn't rule them out,\" says Oldridge. \"They're similar in the way they approach the game. They breathe the game, they won't be willing to let it go easily. We'll see Smith come back, he's the best player in the country. It might take a while (for him to get back to peak performance) after the official ban ends but he'll be back playing for the national team.\"However, the same can't be said for the brash, competitive Warner, whose aggressive style and personality have long made him a player Australians fans have endured, rather than embraced. Cricket Australia investigators say he was the architect of the ball-tampering plan, and a distant, tweeted apology posted ahead of touching down in Sydney on Thursday, in which he wrote \"mistakes have been made,\" and only took responsibility \"for (his) part,\" will not have further endeared him to the crowd. pic.twitter.com/BaB8vsSvif\u2014 David Warner (@davidwarner31) March 29, 2018\n\n\"No doubt he's done at international level,\" says Oldridge.\"The Australian public can't stand Warner. Plenty of people have been celebrating his downfall, from Cricket Australia on downwards. \"His apology is telling, he's brash, you see that in the way he bats, it's not an endearing quality. If he makes a statement, it'll be seen as crocodile teams, unlike the other two.\"Warner is scheduled to make a public statement Saturday.",

'Human foil'That talent and enduring love for golf has kept Mickelson at the top of the game for three decades. At 47, he should be in the twilight of his career, but Mickelson scored his 43rd PGA Tour win this season and appears every bit as fired up and capable of adding to his five major titles and first since 2013. In another time, Mickelson might have been The Man.But five years into his pro career an unprecedented phenomenon hit golf by the name of Tiger Woods.Woods' domination slashed opportunities for the chasing pack and introduced a new dynamic of power and fitness into the game.Mickelson, never an advocate of the gym bunny craze, remained the human foil to the machine-like Woods.The pair weren't close and the relationship appeared to reach a nadir in an ill-fated and ill-judged partnership at the 2004 Ryder Cup. But Mickelson has always credited Woods with making pro golf the lucrative entity it is, and they've grown closer in recent years through Woods' Ryder Cup vice-captaincy roles and shared life struggles.Mickelson and Tiger Woods were paired together in an ill-fated partnership at the 2004 Ryder Cup.Woods and Mickelson have become closer as age and experience mellowed them. Despite Woods' shadow, Mickelson has won -- and blown -- a decent share of tournaments and sits ninth on the list of all-time PGA Tour winners. Despite lengthy spells ranked second in the world, he's never quite got to world No.1.In the early days he was a long-time holder of that double-edged moniker \"best player never to have won a major.\"He dazzled and dueled, and wracked up tournament victories, but he just couldn't turn that talent into major triumph.And then, after three straight thirds at Augusta, he caught fire on the back-nine on the final day in 2004 and birdied the last to beat Ernie Els by one. His first major title in his 12th full season on tour.Mickelson's famous leap, which has become a logo on his golf gear, is regularly brought up reporters looking for sport.\"I can assure you I was not at the apex,\" he always laughs obligingly.Mickelson reaches for the sky after winning his first major at the 2004 Masters.Masters magicMickelson picked up a US PGA in 2005 and added another green jacket the following year. Four years later he made it three. His 2010 win was pure Phil the Thrill.Leading by one as the shadows lengthened on an electric final afternoon, Mickelson drove into the trees to the right of the par-five 13th.  His ball nestled in pine straw, the green apparently blocked by the trunks of two towering Georgia pines. The safe option was to play back out onto the fairway. Mickelson doesn't do safe.\"I'm going for it,\" he told his caddie Jim \"Bones\" Mackay to end one of the pair's by-then legendary on-course discussions. The white-suited bagman, a fixture since 1993 and one of his best friends, wasn't sure. But Mickelson had seen a gap, and threaded a six-iron through the eye of a needle, across the stream that guards the green and to within four feet of the hole. \"The gap wasn't huge, but it was big enough, you know, for a ball to fit through,\" he teased reporters later.Mickelson's shot from the trees on the 13th at Augusta in 2010 went down in Masters legend.He missed the eagle putt, but a birdie four gave him a two-shot lead and he pulled away to beat England's Lee Westwood by three. He hugged wife Amy for what seemed like an eternity behind the green. Everyone knew why.His third Masters title -- tying him for third on the all-time list behind only Arnold Palmer (4), Woods (4) and Jack Nicklaus (6) -- crowned an emotional year after both Amy and his mother Mary had battled breast cancer.   \"In the last year we've been through a lot and it's been tough, and to be on the other end and feel this kind of jubilation is incredible,\" he said. Mickelson embraces wife Amy and shares his 2010 Masters win with his three kids.Cusp of a grand slamCementing his status as a grounded family man, Mickelson was pictured the next morning at the drive-thru counter of a Krispy Kreme doughnut shop in Augusta. Two of his three children were in the car and Mickelson was wearing his Masters green coat. \"It was a little chilly, I threw on a jacket,\" he said later, insisting he'd promised the kids doughnuts before they left town.But Mickelson's testing times weren't over. That summer he was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis, which renders joints swollen and painful.Various drugs, exercise and a healthy sugar-free diet helped Mickelson keep the disease at bay.Three years later at Muirfield, Mickelson clinched the British Open, long thought to be the one major beyond him because its traditional seaside-style links golf didn't suit his game. But winning the Claret Jug gave him his fifth major title and propelled him to the cusp of a career grand slam of all four majors. The British Open was thought to be out of Mickelson's reach because of the style of golf needed to win. US Open 'heartbreak'Only the US Open still eludes him and it's become his nemesis after a record six runner-up spots. Every year the pressure increases as he strives to join the exalted company of Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Nicklaus and Woods as the only players to have completed the set of majors in the Masters era.Perhaps his most agonizing of those misses was when he blew a one-shot lead with a double-bogey on the 72nd hole of the 2006 US Open at Winged Foot. \"I just can't believe that I did that,\" he said afterward. \"I am such an idiot.\"      Another was at Shinnecock Hills in 2004, venue for this year's US Open. The most recent was at Merion in 2013. \"If I never get the Open,\" he said after losing by one to Justin Rose, \"...then every time I think of the [US] Open, I just think of heartbreak.\" In 2017, despite the pull of the grand slam, he missed the event to attend his daughter's high school graduation. Outside of his wins, Mickelson has had 18 top threes in majors --  Nicklaus, winner of the most majors with 18, was also second a record 19 times.The US Open is Mickelson's nemesis after a record six runner-up spots. Mickelson's biggest US Open miss was at Winged Foot in 2006.But despite the lengthy post-round autograph sessions, the fan interaction, the tales of lavish tips, the informative and entertaining interviews, the taking young players under his wing, and the unfailing sponsor obligations, any conversation about Mickelson always dredges up another of his nicknames: \"Phil the Phony.\"There is -- or at least there was in the early days -- a school of thought that Mickelson's mojo is a fraud, that behind the scenes he is less magnanimous than his public persona.Even this season, Mickelson's critics laid into him for asking Englishman Tyrrell Hatton how to pronounce his first name as they prepared to play together in Mexico. Disrespectful, cried some. Nonsense, it was Phil being a stand-up guy and trying to get it right, say others. Mickelson is hugely poular with fans, young and old.'Bad rap'O'Donoghue is a \"huge fan\" and recounts a tale where Mickelson, with whom he had developed a fledgling acquaintance over his son and the American's shared birthday, called him \"Seamus\" during a TV interview. The next time they met, two years later, the first thing Mickelson did was apologize.\"He looks at me and says, 'Shane, I am so embarrassed about calling you Seamus,'\" said O'Donoghue.He added: \"He's the consummate pro and he's an amazing ambassador for the game and the best PGA Tour player of the modern era in terms of what he gives back. He delivers on so many different levels.\"He gets a bad rap from some of the players and some of the media, that he's not that sincere, that it's a bit of an act. I've yet to see that side of him. My dealings with him have always been 100% professional and I've always been very impressed by him.\"JUST WATCHEDJordan Spieth tees it up with Lorena OchoaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHJordan Spieth tees it up with Lorena Ochoa 03:36Critics also point to his well reported fondness for high-stakes gambling and the legendary trash-talking Tuesday money games with a close coterie of colleagues.Then there are the links to the fraud case of Las Vegas gambler William \"Billy\" Walters (Mickelson himself didn't face any charges), in which he was forced to pay back $1 million linked to insider trading, following the repayment of a $2 million gambling debt to Walters in 2012.One of Mickelson's most controversial moments came in the Team USA news conference after losing the 2014 Ryder Cup at Gleneagles, Scotland. Asked what didn't work compared to the winning side in 2008, Mickelson threw captain Tom Watson, sitting a few seats to his left, under the bus.\"I think he got caught out a bit by being too blunt and oversharing a little bit,\" said O'Donoghue.\"But these guys are gladiators -- they all want to win and they all have their own opinions.\"Mickelson sparked controversy with scathing critcism of Tom Watson's Ryder Cup captaincy in 2014.Mickelson, it seems, will continue to divide opinion, at least off the course.On it, he is in line for a 12th straight Ryder Cup appearance this year. A first victory on European soil remains one of his remaining \"big goals.\" He'll have to do it for the first time without Bones on the bag after the pair's amicable split in June 2017. Mickelson wanted to freshen things up and has turned to his brother Tim, a former golf coach at Arizona State and ex-agent to rising Spanish star Jon Rahm.

The 34-year-old batsman has played 16 Tests for England and 194 first-class matches. He writes for CNN Sport on the ball-tampering scandal. (CNN)What next for cricket following the ball-tampering scandal which has led to lengthy bans for Australian trio Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft and rocked the sport?Clearly the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), needs to take a stronger lead and ensure punishment for players, captains and teams are suitably strong. The game's culture at the top level needs to be highly competitive, but it also needs to be played with integrity. Harsh, but fair, penalties for transgressors are needed. Financial penalties rarely work when people are highly paid but, for instance, by taking players out of a series for ball tampering, or sending them off during a match, the player and the national team's captain is punished. Read MoreSuch punishments would probably lead to a defeat and the offending individual would become a national disgrace. If players are a risk, in terms of being sent off, then selectors would think twice about whether or not they are worth selecting. If a captain were to be suspended for a player's transgression too then that would also crank up his role as a leader.Surely that would ensure players behave 'properly' all of the time?READ: Lehmann to step down after scandalREAD: 'I'll regret this' - Steve Smith JUST WATCHEDFormer Aussie cricket captain Smith speaksReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFormer Aussie cricket captain Smith speaks 01:58'Make the game fairer'Another change which could be made is to allow ball tampering -- as long as an 'outside agent,' such as sandpaper or a bottle top, which have both been used in the past -- are not permitted. Former captain Smith has been banned by Cricket Australia for a yearREAD: Trio's cheating harms national psycheREAD: 'These guys are broken, they know they've done wrong'But the real key to improving the game is to ensure a fairer balance between bat and ball. Reverse swing -- which is essentially what Australia were trying to get the ball to do by attempting to rough up one side -- is a necessary part of a bowler's armory and makes the game more entertaining. It takes a high level of skill to use reverse swing effectively and we want to see the best players in the world at the height of their profession. In recent years, the game has been tilted too much in favor of the batsmen. Bats are bigger, boundaries are smaller, pitches are flat to ensure Test matches go into a fifth day and so maximizing revenue.But one of the best Tests recently, South Africa against India at the Wanderers Stadium, which India won by 63 runs, was gripping because of the 'spicy' pitch. The best players still played well -- the liveliness of the surface sorted out 'the men from the boys.'The game needs to help the bowlers more because the imbalance between bat and ball is one reason why bowlers and fielders have felt the need to alter the condition of the ball in an underhand way.Sledging as bullyingAnother subject which needs addressing is the sport's culture. Fundamentally, the culture of Australian cricket over the last three years has diminished and there's no question that their behavior on the field has not been of a good enough standard.Australia's former captain Steve Waugh famously called sledging 'mental disintegration' -- it's a form of bullying. If it's done in the right way I don't have a problem with it because I think it adds to the competitive nature of the sport, but what I have a problem with is when it's a premeditated form of bullying, where you personally attack someone verbally. That must be outlawed.JUST WATCHEDAustralia cricket captain resigns over scandalReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAustralia cricket captain resigns over scandal 01:34READ: Why is ball tampering such a big deal The best of Australia's cricketing culture is best exemplified by the late, great Keith Miller, widely regarded as Australia's greatest all-rounder. Miller, who played 55 Tests, was a close friend of my late grandfather Denis Compton, one of England's greatest batsmen. Miller had perspective -- he had fought in the Second World War as a fighter pilot for the Royal Australian Air Force. He said this about playing Test cricket: \"Pressure doesn't exist when playing Test cricket - pressure is having a Messerschmidt up your arse!\" Miller (right) is regarded as one of Australia's greatest cricketersThough Compton and Miller were fierce opponents, they were also the best of friends come close of play and remained so after they had retired. They embodied the true spirit of cricket, and I would urge all international cricketers to reflect on their wonderful example and regard that as the way forward.What now for Australia? Tim Paine will captain Australia in the fourth Test following Smith's 12-month ban and it's a tough assignment but, from what I know, he seems to be a well-rounded individual. He is a fine cricketer, too. This Test, which is already under way at the Wanderers Stadium, may represent a bit of an audition for Paine as Smith's long-term successor -- but there is a better candidate. South Africa fans hold a banner as they mock Australia's cricket players during day one of the fourth Test I'd choose George Bailey of Tasmania. The 35-year-old has recently played for English counties Middlesex and Hampshire and has, in the past, captained Australia's Twenty20 side and one-day international team. Bailey is a balanced and wise person who is totally committed to the concept of the team. He could provide the quality of leadership needed to help Australia move through this crisis and, over the next 18 months, help rebuild the team and its commitment to a values-based culture. Justin Langer would be an excellent choice to replace Darren Lehmann as head coach, too. Langer was part of the great Australian teams of the 1990s, representing Australia in over 100 Tests. He also helped turn around the culture at Somerset County Cricket Club during his playing days. Since retiring as a player, the former batsman has carved out a successful coaching career with Western Australia and also enjoyed success with the Perth Scorchers. He is a quality individual.  'No crime has been committed'Time will tell if Cricket Australia have got the balance right between punishing the players and protecting their wellbeing. In terms of what's happened in the immediacy of this aftermath, they've had to make a tough stand. To ban Smith and Warner for a year and Bancroft for nine months is right, even if, in some ways, it seems a bit harsh.A mistake's a mistake. There was a premeditated nature to it, they've been made examples of -- and so they should -- but let's keep it in perspective.It's like they've killed people. These guys are not criminals. The important thing is that we remember these people are human beings.They made a mistake, a bad mistake -- but we need to make sure that we consider them as people so that when they come back in a year's time they are reformed characters, they have a new lease of life in terms of their perspective on the game and they return to the international game as more mature sportsmen who will uphold the integrity of this great game.

As principal of the Reformed Teachers Training College, van Hulst found himself at the center of a growing operation to smuggle Jewish children out of Amsterdam to protect them from Nazi persecution during the Second World War. The college garden bordered that of a Jewish day-care center, from which hundreds of Jewish children were passed over the garden fence to be temporarily hidden by van Hulst before being collected by members of a children's rescue organization and smuggled to safety. \"Try to imagine 80, 90, perhaps 70 or 100 children standing there, and you have to decide which children to take with you.... That was the most difficult day of my life,\" he remembered of the period in 1943 when the Jewish day-care center was due to be cleared out, according to Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center. \"You realize that you cannot possibly take all the children with you. You know for a fact that the children you leave behind are going to die. I took twelve with me. Later on I asked myself: 'Why not thirteen?'\" Germany's Holocaust mini-memorials go missing amid far-right backlashRead MoreFollowing the end of the Second World War, he became an active member of the Christian Democratic Appeal Party and later became a senator. Ankie Broekers-Knol, president of the Dutch senate, told CNN in a statement that van Hulst \"led an extraordinary life. He will be remembered as an icon of democracy.

Yad Vashem spokesperson Simmy Allen said van Hulst will be remembered by \"the entire Jewish people for his valiant efforts in the rescue of Jews during the Holocaust.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu paid tribute to van Hulst during a trip to the Netherlands in 2012. \"We say those who save one life saves a universe. You saved hundreds of universes. I want to thank you in the name of the Jewish people, but also in the name of humanity,\" Netanyahu told the senator, according to The Times of Israel. The Dutch ambassador to Israel, Gilles Beschoor Plug, told CNN that van Hulst \"will be remembered especially as a hero of the Dutch resistance during World War II. His passing is a great loss.

        "content": "(CNN)Its roaring brass section is so epic and loud that Francis Ford Coppola used it in the iconic helicopter-attack scene from \"Apocalypse Now.\"But now Richard Wagner's \"Die Walk\u00fcre\" opera, featuring its famed \"Ride of the Valkyries\" section, is at the center of a legal judgment won by a viola player against the renowned Royal Opera House in London. Violist Christopher Goldscheider claimed he sustained irreversible damage to his hearing during a 2012 rehearsal of Wagner's composition -- an injury he says ruined his career.Seated in a \"cramped pit\" before 18 to 20 brass players, Goldscheider said he suffered \"acoustic shock\" after being exposed to noise levels that reached peaks of 137 dB -- roughly the volume of a military jet taking off, according to a ruling Wednesday by Britain's High Court. In an 83-page judgment, Justice Nicola Davies ruled that the Royal Opera House failed to protect the hearing of its musicians, in breach of the Control of Noise at Work Regulations law of 2005.  Read MoreDavies said musicians \"are entitled to the protection of the law as is any other worker.\"Case 'will send shockwaves' Goldscheider, who filed the lawsuit in 2016 claiming 750,000 pounds ($1.05 million) in lost earnings, said he was unable to continue his career as classical musician because of the injuries suffered at the rehearsal. Damages are still to be assessed. \"This case has significance and will send shockwaves across the Music Business,\" Goldscheider's solicitor, Chris Fry, said in a blog post. \"The Music Business has considered itself exempt from the same regulatory requirements as all other sectors because of the artistic nature of its output. This in our view has always been a dismissive view from an industry which creates and sells 'noise' as a product.\"The ruling is historic because it marks the first time that \"acoustic shock\" has been recognized as worthy of compensation by a British court, according to the BBC. The Royal Opera House claimed in a statement that acoustic shock does not exist and that if it did, Goldscheider did not have it. They argued he instead had developed Meniere's disease, a chronic inner-ear disorder whose symptoms include vertigo. But Justice Davies dismissed this view, saying: \"I regard the defendant's contention that Meniere's disease developed at the rehearsal as stretching the concept of coincidence too far.\"In a statement after the ruling, the Royal Opera House said its expert medical advice indicated that long-term hearing damage could not be caused by an isolated incident of exposure to live music.\"We have been at the forefront of industry-wide attempts to protect musicians from the dangers of exposure to significant levels of performance sound,\" the Royal Opera House told the BBC.\"We do not believe that the Noise Regulations can be applied in an artistic institution in the same manner as in a factory, not least because in the case of the Royal Opera House, sound is not a by-product of an industrial process but is an essential part of the product itself.\"The Royal Opera House said it \"will consider carefully\" whether to appeal the judgment.A career ruinedGoldscheider, 45, started playing violin at the age of 5 and the viola at about 21, Fry said. He was promoted to number six viola at the Royal Opera House after joining the orchestra as number eleven in 2002. Over the years he shared the stage with everyone from Kylie Minogue to the Three Tenors. But after that fateful rehearsal of Wagner's \"Die Walk\u00fcre,\" Goldscheider's career was over, Fry said. Despite his use of earplugs, the brass section \"playing directly behind him, in a confined area, at the same time at different frequencies and volumes, created a wall of sound which was completely different to anything he had previously experienced,\" Justice Davies said in the judgment. Four trumpets, four trombones, nine French horns and one tuba created a \"direct line of fire\" which was \"excruciatingly loud and painful,\" the judge wrote.After the session, Goldscheider went home and started to experience pain in both ears along with increasing dizziness, according to the ruling. He tried to return to work on a number of occasions but found it impossible. \"He would feel terribly nauseous, extremely unwell from the pain in his right ear, he felt dizzy and found it difficult to walk,\" Davies said in the ruling. Goldscheider left the orchestra in 2014 and moved to the countryside to lessen his exposure to noise.Acoustic shock, which includes symptoms such as tinnitus, hyperacusis, and dizziness, also wrecked Goldscheider's personal life, as he told the BBC.\"With this condition if you are exposed to normal sounds, unfortunately they become incredibly painful,\" he said. \"I suppose the nearest analogy is if you imagine for a normal person to walk on normal ground and then you imagine walking barefoot on glass.\"Goldscheider told the BBC he was \"overjoyed\" at the ruling, \"and I hope it will prevent any more musicians being injured from today onwards.\"",

These are their stories.Romford, England (CNN)On a brilliantly sunny spring morning in Romford Market, an elderly couple sip coffee, close their eyes and tilt their faces to the sky.\"Who needs Tenerife, eh?\" asks a friendly passerby, referring to the popular Spanish holiday destination.The answer, apparently, is not the people of Romford.This is the largest town in Havering, a borough on the outermost fringes of east London that had one of the highest proportion of Leave voters in the 2016 Brexit referendum.

Read MoreWith one year until Brexit is set to happen, Havering's majority white and elderly population is feeling impatient.On March 29, 2019, Britain will leave the EU officially. But it'll still be some time before the UK feels the effects, having struck a transition deal in mid-March allowing an additional 21 months to implement policy.Fed up with politicians dragging their heels in seemingly endless rounds of negotiations, Romford residents -- regardless of how they voted -- want the government to roll up its sleeves and get on with the job.CNN spoke to some of them.The fishmonger fed up with 'pen-pushers'Dave Crosbie, 60, owner of The Best Plaice seafood stall in Romford Market.The one-year Brexit deadline can't come soon enough for fishmonger and Leave voter Dave Crosbie. \"I'll be glad when it's all over and done with, and we're out,\" says Crosbie, a third-generation fishmonger who's been in the business since his teens.Seafood for sale at Crosbie's stall.Crosbie is a well-known character at Romford Market -- his imposing height, brilliant white apron and booming cockney accent make him easy to spot among the rows of stalls selling boiled sweets, fruit and faux-fur jackets. \"I think it's typical politicians dragging things out again because they don't know what they're doing,\" says Crosbie of the Brexit negotiations so far. \"They're pen-pushers -- they're not actually businessmen who know what they're doing. They're just playing it by ear and hoping for the best.\"READ MORE FROM THE SERIESThe British town that really wants to leave EuropeOne month on: is the Brexit honeymoon over?Brexit 'made me feel like a foreigner again'Were Crosbie to have his time again he'd vote Leave \"100% -- no regrets whatsoever.\" But what he'd like to see is \"a lot harder Brexit than the one they've been coming up with in the papers.\"Fishing rights have been a fraught area of negotiations. Crosbie says that if the UK regains exclusive control of its waters it would create jobs lost to \"Europeans coming over into our waters and catching our fish.\"A customer waits in line at Crosbie's trailer.\"It means they (people in fishing communities) don't have to claim benefits, it gets their self-esteem up, gives them some fire in themselves and it don't cost the government millions and millions in unemployment,\" says Crosbie in between sips of tea while his wife serves customers at their seafood trailer.\"It's a win-win situation,\" he adds.The Remainer who decided to run for officeAngelina Leatherbarrow, 42, a patient experience facilitator at Queen's Hospital in Romford.This wasn't the outcome Remain voter Angelina Leatherbarrow wanted.But with one year until Brexit, the mother of two has resolved to \"roll up our sleeves and say let's get on with it.\"\"We can't go back in time,\" says Leatherbarrow as she gets her daughters ready for school before heading off to work at the local hospital. \"I can choose to be a 'Remoaner' and complain about what's happening, or I can challenge the impact and make sure we leave Europe in the least-damaging way possible,\" says Leatherbarrow, who in the last year has decided to run as a Labour candidate in upcoming local council elections.Leatherbarrow dresses her daughter Martha, 3, for school.Since the referendum, Leatherbarrow has seen a rise in \"Brexstremist rhetoric\" in the borough and recounts a story about an Asian woman being racially abused by a shop assistant.\"When I challenged that, I became the problem. I was told 'It's people like you that are arguing against me' -- it was as if I was betraying the white working classes by calling out racism.\"Leatherbarrow's older daughter, 6-year-old Gwen, is silhouetted against their front window.Leatherbarrow is half Maltese and grew up in London's East End, having moved to Romford more than a decade ago in search of the type of home with a garden unaffordable to many young families in the inner city.\"I want my children to grow up in communities where they'll meet people from different backgrounds, speak different languages, experience different foods and cultures and music,\" she says. \"I don't want those things to be taken away from my girls.\"The market vendor frustrated with 'negative press'Graeme Gibbons, 53, owner of Penny's household-goods stall in Romford Market.For market vendor and Leave voter Graeme Gibbons, the referendum result was something to be celebrated -- it's just a pity that the press hasn't seen it that way.\"It's always very negative when it's spoken about,\" he says, in between serving a steady stream of white-haired customers at the cleaning-products stall he's owned for more than two decades.\"We had a referendum, we decided to leave and we're being dragged back looking at the downside all the time,\" says Gibbons. \"We've got a fantastic country, so let's move forward, let's look to the future.\"Products labeled in Spanish on display at Gibbons' stall.Gibbons is happy with how the Brexit negotiations have progressed so far, but admitted that \"they're going quite slowly.\" Nevertheless he remains upbeat about the political wrangling between London and Brussels, adding \"We've been in something for 40 years, we're not just going to get out of it in five minutes.\"Gibbons has already taken a financial hit since the Brexit vote, with some of his European stock becoming more expensive against the falling pound. But it's a price he's willing to pay for the chance to have his three children \"grow up in the Britain that I enjoyed, where they've got a chance to own their own property.\"Gibbons serves customers at his stall in Romford Market.He says sky-high housing prices are partly a result of the \"massive influx of people we've had in a short space of time.\"\"Sometimes in the market I don't hear an English voice, and English isn't the first language in schools. Services like the NHS (National Health Service) are stretched,\" adds the vendor who would vote Leave again in a heartbeat. Does Gibbons think Brexit will roll back the clock on Britain? \"It won't get any worse, will it?\" he replies.The marketing executive who says 'we're a laughing joke'Emma Hamblett, 46, marketing and business development executive at PricewaterhouseCoopers in London.Emma Hamblett has lived in Romford her entire life, but when it came to the referendum she bucked the trend and voted Remain -- even when her husband voted Leave.\"We do joke about it -- every time something bad on Brexit happens I just blame him for it,\" says the mother of three. \"But I think he's erring towards Remain now, just because he can see the chaos that's happened since the referendum, and the lies that have been told and how much worse off we are going to be.\"Hamblett has also shifted her position ever so slightly in the two years since the Brexit vote. She'd still vote Remain but would also \"like the EU to recognize there will be some changes within that, because we do have to think about why people voted Leave.\"\"We can't just roll over and accept whatever the EU is going to give us,\" she adds.Hamblett makes tea at her home in Romford.Hamblett is scathing on the government's handling of Brexit negotiations so far. \"We have been dragging our heels and I feel that we're a laughing joke in Europe,\" she says. Like Leatherbarrow, she has recently decided to stand as a Labour candidate in the local elections. Since the vote, Hamblett says an \"undertone\" of racism has prompted close friends to move away from the borough.Family photos of Hamblett's husband and children. \"It's almost felt like people have been given a license to say things outside the house, which they normally would have kept inside,\" says Hamblett. \"You can hear it walking down the street, people are calling names out to Eastern Europeans.\"I don't know if it's purely down to Brexit, or its just a sign of the times and things aren't as nice as they used to be.\"How nice things will be in Romford 12 months from now is anyone's guess.",

        "content": "(CNN)Detectives with London's Metropolitan Police said Wednesday they believe former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter first came into contact with a nerve agent at Sergei Skripal's home, and police have identified the highest concentration of the nerve agent to date as being on the home's front door. The pair were poisoned March 4 after being exposed to what British police believe was a military-grade nerve agent. They are hospitalized in critical condition.Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were found slumped on a bench in an outdoor shopping complex in Salisbury, England. They had no visible injuries, according to police.Officer on duty outside Sergei Skripal's house in early March.They were near a number of restaurants, one of which was closed as part of the initial investigation.Detectives now plan to focus their investigation around Sergei Skripal's Salisbury home for the coming weeks and possibly months, the Met Police said. Yulia Skripal was visiting her father.Read MorePolice also plan to search the surrounding area.Yulia Skripal\"Those living in the Skripals' neighborhood can expect to see officers carrying out searches as part of this, but I want to reassure them that the risk remains low and our searches are precautionary,\" Deputy Assistant Commissioner Dean Haydon said in a statement.Around 250 counterterrorism detectives are working around the clock on the investigation, the Met Police said, adding it is one of the largest and most complex investigations undertaken by British counterterrorism police.Officers are examining more than 5,000 hours of closed-circuit television and more than 1,350 seized items, police said. They have identified around 500 witnesses and taken hundreds of statements.Detectives have found traces of the nerve agent at other scenes in the past few weeks but at lower concentrations than at the home address, the Met Police said.Surveillance footage shows Sergei Skripal shopping at a convenience store days before he was poisoned.Diplomatic falloutThe UK has expelled 23 Russian diplomats over the poisoning of the Skripals, which it blames on Moscow. Russia denies it was involved and has suggested the UK could be behind it.In a show of support for Britain, more than 20 other countries have kicked out Russian diplomats. Those countries include the United States, Canada, Australia and 18 European Union states.These are all the countries that are expelling Russian diplomatsIn a speech Wednesday evening, British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson thanked the countries \"from the bottom of my heart\" for standing with Britain, saying they did it despite the risk of retaliation.\"I believe that these expulsions represent a moment when a feeling has suddenly crystallized, when years of vexation and provocation have worn collective patience to (the) breaking point, and when across the world -- across three continents -- there are countries who are willing to say enough is enough,\" Johnson said at an annual gathering of the diplomatic corps in London.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the United States pressured and blackmailed other countries to expel Russian diplomats.British Prime Minister Theresa May speaks Monday in Parliament.Moscow has already responded by expelling 23 British diplomats and shuttering British cultural institutions in Russia. Tuesday, Lavrov warned of further retaliation, saying, \"Rest assured, we will respond,\" according to state media.Russia's ambassador to Australia called the expulsions \"unfair.\"\"It's rather like the beginning of 'Crime and Punishment,'\" Johnson said. \"We're all confident of the culprit, and the only question is whether he will first confess or be caught.\"The Skripals 'may never fully recover'According to the UK, the Skripals were exposed to a Soviet-era nerve agent known as Novichok, a colorless, odorless and tasteless liquid described as one of the world's most sophisticated and deadly chemical weapons.Russia warns of retaliation after at least 100 diplomats expelled worldwideWhile British officials have said they believe the public health risk is low, Prime Minister Theresa May has also said more than 130 people in Salisbury could have been exposed to the nerve agent.May said Monday that doctors have indicated the Skripals may never fully recover.\"This shows the utterly barbaric nature of this act and the dangers that hundreds of innocent citizens in Salisbury could have faced,\" May said.Johnson said Wednesday that the Kremlin underestimated the global response to the poisoning.\"If they thought that the world had become so hardened and so cynical as not to care about the use of chemical weapons in a place like Salisbury,\" he said, \"if they believed that no one would give a fig about the suffering of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, or that we would be indifferent to the reckless and contemptuous disregard for public safety ... then this is their answer.\"CNN's Zahra Ullah contributed to this report.",

Police named them only as Mr. O.C.P and Mr. J.B.P.Police recovered a number of artworks after searching five locations.They were arrested in Barcelona for their \"alleged participation in the crimes of financing terrorism, belonging to a criminal organization, trading in stolen goods, smuggling and forging documents.\"Mosul offensive: Assyrian artifacts discovered in abandoned ISIS tunnelsThe statement said that the suspects were part of a Catalonia-based network with international reach dedicated to the retail of artworks from territories controlled by groups affiliated to ISIS.Read MoreThe two men used foreign intermediaries to acquire the artworks, and concealed the origin of the goods by dispatching them from Asia and different parts of the Middle East, police said.After searching five locations, including storage facilities and the gallery where some looted pieces were on sale to the public, police recovered artworks including sculptures, mosaics and sarcophagi.With the help of the Libyan authorities, police verified the authenticity of the pieces and traced their origin to the Apollonia and Cyrene archaeological sites in northern Libya, both of which have been looted by terrorist groups.The recovered items included sculptures and mosaics.Some of the recovered pieces showed imperfections such as bumps and dents that suggested they had been extracted from the ground violently and transported insecurely, police said.Police believe the suspects carried out restoration work on the artworks in Spain in an attempt to disguise the damage. After ISIS, Iraq needs $88.2 billion to rebuildMembers of ISIS have destroyed or looted a number of ancient cultural treasures in Syria and Iraq, often posting videos of their vandalism online.In 2015, the FBI asked art collectors and dealers to look out for antiquities that could have been put on the market by ISIS.The warning came after \"credible reports\" that some Americans had been offered cultural items that seemed to have been taken from Syria and Iraq, according to a statement at the time from Bonnie Magness-Gardiner, who was then manager of the FBI's Art Theft Program.",

        "content": "Berlin (CNN)Artist Gunter Demnig works quickly and quietly. He kneels down to remove a slab of Berlin pavement and carefully replaces it with three small brass plaques, engraved with the names of the Boschwitz family. They lived here 75 years ago before they were sent to Auschwitz and murdered. \"For some people, it's like a gravestone. They don't have somewhere to grieve,\" Demnig explains to CNN. \"So this is a place to remember. It cannot be a gravestone but for some people it is like a gravestone.\"These are \"stumbling stones,\" Demnig's extraordinary memorial to the more than 6 million killed in the Holocaust. The concept is simple: a brass plaque for every casualty of the slaughter. He began 20 years ago and the idea has now taken him to more than 21 countries, installing more than 67 thousand plaques. It is the largest memorial of its kind in the world.  Gunter Demnig, the artist behind the \"stumbling stones,\" installs brass plaques for individuals killed in the Holocaust.Someone once chided him about placing memorials that people could trip over. \"I said, no. You won't fall. But if you stumble and look, you must bow down with your head and your heart,\" he said.Read MoreFar right slams 'dictatorship of memory'Germany has worked to ensure the horrors of World War II are not forgotten. The walls of the country's parliament are still scarred with the anti-Nazi graffiti left by Soviet soldiers. And German schoolchildren are required to visit Holocaust memorials. But a backlash against the way history is taught has been brewing.AfD politician Wolfgang Gedeon has criticized the \"stumbling stone\" project.Germany's nationalist, far-right party the Alternative for Germany (AfD) is challenging not just Demnig's memorial but Germany's \"culture of remembrance,\" which it has described as a \"dictatorship of memory.\"\"With their actions, the stumbling stone initiators impose a culture of remembrance on their fellow human beings, dictating to them how they should remember who and when,\" wrote AfD lawmaker Wolfgang Gedeon in a statement to his local parliament in February. \"Who gives these obtrusive moralists the right to do so?\"Anti-Semitism is still alive in Germany 70 years after the HolocaustOn a cold winter morning in Berlin, a group of schoolchildren crouch down to watch as Demnig puts the finishing touches on the Boschwitz family stones. They listen as Irene Weingartner explains why she wrote to Demnig requesting him to place the stumbling stones here: Her grandmother had befriended the Boschwitz family and their young son. When the parents didn't return home one night in February 1943, her grandmother tried to reunite the boy with his parents, not knowing that they would all be sent to Auschwitz and killed. \"My grandmother was always terribly sad that she could not help this little boy. All my life I knew about it. So, it was important for me to tell other people,\" Weingartner tells CNN. The Boschwitz family lived at this address in Berlin 75 years ago. The stones mark the day they were sent to Auschwitz.How it worksOne of the unique aspects of the stumbling stones is that it is a growing, grassroots memorial. Families and friends wishing for their loved ones to be memorialized write to the Stumbling Stones Foundation set up by Demnig. His team researches and verifies the information to be put on the plaques then obtains permission from city governments to install them. Weingartner said it took more than a year for her request to be put through and she invited the local school to attend the installation. \"It seems like ancient history to kids,\" she says, \"But when they feel what happened to this child they will never forget it. And I hope they will help them to challenge injustice, racism and hatred in the world.\"The stones commemorating the Boschwitz family mark the day they were sent to Auschwitz.The memorial has a clear impact on the children, who place flowers on the stones and write notes. One boy says to his schoolmate: \"He was only eight years old when he learned his parents would never come back.\" His friend replies, \"That's only two years younger than us.\" But even at this small gathering, there is a tension. An irritated man tries to push a pram through the crowd and mutters to no one in particular: \"What is all this? Another stumbling stone? We already have too many!\" Since the project started, nearly 400 stumbling stones have been stolen and the number is on the rise. Police are investigating neo-Nazi gangs as possible suspects in the thefts. Demnig has installed more than 67,000 \"stumbling stones.\"Subject of debateWolfgang Gedeon's call to ban stumbling stones in his constituency was rejected by the local mayor, but it sparked a debate in parliament about how Germany should remember its World War II history. The far-right AfD party is now the largest opposition party in parliament and its lawmakers have become increasingly vocal in their demands, not only to put an end to immigration and ban Islam, but also to revise Germany's remembrance culture. We can say goodbye to a stable GermanyAlexander Gauland, the head of the AfD's parliamentary wing, has openly praised the \"achievements\" of Nazi German soldiers. And when Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, a Holocaust survivor, addressed the Bundestag in January to praise Germany's \"generous brave and human gesture\" to take in modern-day refugees, AfD lawmakers sat in stony silence and refused to applaud. Gedeon declined CNN's request for an interview. When Demnig is asked how he views Gedeon's complaint, the artist laughs it off: \"That's their normal way. But we will continue this for the young people. That's the idea: We do it for the young people.\"Irene Weingartner has harsher words: \"Those people who think they are very good Germans are bad Germans if they refuse to remember what has happened in Germany and by the German people.''Demnig started his project 20 years ago.Demnig knocks the dirt from his legs and adjusts his trademark wide-brimmed hat before picking up his bucket of tools. He heads to his next installation, where a family reunion with members from Germany and Argentina has taken place so they can watch him install plaques to their grandparents. They come with flowers and hold a small ceremony as he hammers in the stones and gently wipes the plague to reveal the family name. When he's done, Demnig tries to slip quietly away but is clearly embarrassed when one family member presses a bouquet into his hands.  He prefers the focus to be on the stones, but he is proud of what he has accomplished so far. \"I have had people tell me this: Now, I can come to Germany again,\" he says. \"And yes, I am proud of that.\"",

He'd cry when he was told it was time to go home. His idol was Woods, who clinched his breakthrough 1997 Masters win when Rory was not quite eight.\"I wrote a letter at nine saying that one day hopefully I'd be competing against him,\" McIlroy said in a documentary commissioned for the Open Championship. \"Sometimes those things turn into reality and luckily for me it did.\" READ: McIlroy wins for first time since 2016'Mozart'But luck didn't really come into it. Innate talent, \"passion for the game,\" and the dedication of his parents Rosie and Gerry, working multiple jobs and pouring \"every penny\" into their only child's obsession, were the foundations for a career which has so far yielded four major titles and north of $50 million in prize money.\"The word was this kid from Holywood was a bit extra special,\" says CNN Living Golf host Shane O'Donoghue, who first saw McIlroy in action in 2004.\"He'd just turned 14 and was clearly very different. He looked like a cherubic little boy but played with an exuberance that was totally different. It was like watching a virtuoso. I very quickly christened him Northern Ireland's Mozart, in golf terms.\"READ: Tiger Woods sparks 181% boost in TV audience     The Irishman has seen him grow from precocious talent and child prodigy, to the boy who would be king and then global superstar, based in Florida with the huge mansion, fast cars and private jet.\"He was a nice, normal kid. He hasn't changed,\" adds O'Donoghue. \"Circumstances have changed phenomenally around him and he's had to deal with all of that but he's still the same Rory. At the heart of it he's still Gerry and Rosie's boy.\"READ: Mickelson ends longest career droughtDespite the fame, wealth and celebrity status, the Holywood star is still very grounded with a close coterie of school friends. When he parted company with long-time caddie JP Fitzgerald in 2017 he turned to best mate Harry Diamond to shoulder the bag.  He's had the same coach,  former Holywood pro Michael Bannon, since he began the game using cut-down clubs. Though McIlroy was well known on the amateur circuit, he came to wider prominence as a chirpy, chubby 18-year-old at the 2007 Open Championship at Carnoustie, where he tied for third after the first round, bettering the then 12-time major champion Woods by one shot. He turned pro the day after the Walker Cup, the amateur version of the Ryder Cup, that September. Joining the paid ranks was like adding a spark to rocket fuel.

Within five years of turning pro he was world No. 1.But McIlroy's professional career has been punctuated more by bursts of brilliance than the relentless domination of Woods in his heyday. McIlroy's mojo has occasionally gone walkabout when life gets in the way of what was once pure pleasure. \"He is a bit mercurial but that's part of his normality,\" says O'Donoghue. \"He's not a robot, he is an artist. \"He will have down times, he will have the odd disaster, but my God, the highs more than make up for it because when he is on he's different class.\"JUST WATCHEDSergio Garcia on the Masters and his familyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSergio Garcia on the Masters and his family 05:34'Meltdown'McIlroy's trajectory was on collision course for a first major title, and for 63 holes of the 2011 Masters it looked like a coronation.He led by four heading into the final day, and still held a one-shot cushion on the 10th tee. What followed was an agonizing and public disintegration.He pulled his drive into the woods, and plunged into a downward spiral, dropping six shots in three holes. Shell-shocked, he carded 80. \"I don't think I can put it down to anything else than part of the learning curve,\" he said ruefully at the time. Many observers thought the experience could scar him for life. McIlroy proved otherwise, smashing a host of records as he clinched the US Open at Congressional two months later. \"It was a sensational rebound,\" says O'Donoghue. \"He was approachable, accessible, attractive, CEOs wanted to be around him, kids wanted to be like him, men wanted to be his friend and woman wanted to either mother him or adore him. He just had the X factor.\" JUST WATCHEDPGA Tour Commissioner on Tiger Woods Effect ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPGA Tour Commissioner on Tiger Woods Effect  03:21'Authenticity'But the boom-or-bust cycle continued. That summer he coped badly with wild weather in the Open at Royal St George's, telling reporters: \"I'm not a fan of golf tournaments predicted so much by the weather, it's not my sort of golf.\"It was blunt and honest, and created a stir. \"He's never lost that boyish quality and never lost the quality of just telling it like it is. It gets him into trouble occasionally but the great ones are all a bit dogged in their opinions and views,\" says O'Donoghue. Victory back in the warmth of Florida the following March took McIlroy to the world No. 1 spot for the first time at the age of 22.That summer he landed a second major with the US PGA title in another record-breaking performance. He ended the season as the leading money winner on both the European and PGA Tours and was the game's hottest property.But he hadn't lost his impishness. A mess-up with his alarm clock meant he was nearly late for his tee time on the final day of the Ryder Cup and needed a police escort to reach the course. He still won his match against Keegan Bradley as Europe won the \"Miracle of Medinah.\"McIlroy's stock was sky high, and early in 2013 he signed a multimillion dollar deal to use Nike equipment and clothing.Struggling to adapt, and having split from his management company,  his form and confidence dipped. At the Open that summer, McIlroy gave another honest assessment of his inner thoughts, describing himself as \"brain dead\" after a disastrous first round. \"Sometimes I feel like I'm walking around out there and I'm unconscious,\" he said.\"He's breaking news even when he's playing badly and a lot of that has to do with his authenticity,\" says O'Donoghue.

Three days later he won the European Tour's flagship BMW PGA Championship and then achieved his childhood dream, the Open Championship, at Hoylake in July. His dominant win emulated Woods' procession at Hoylake in 2006, and made him the only other player, alongside Woods, to win the silver medal and Claret Jug. He also became the first European to win three different majors, and he joined Woods and Nicklaus as only the third player to win three by 25. Not only that, but Gerry McIlroy was able to collect on a bet he and three friends had struck back in 2004 at odds of 500-1 that the young Rory would win the Open \"within the next 10 years.\"They each scooped \u00a350,000.Within a few weeks McIlroy won a World Golf Championship event and then his fourth major, the US PGA Championship.   \"Rory is an unbelievable talent. I think Rory has an opportunity to win 15 or 20 majors or whatever he wants to do if he wants to keep playing. I love his swing,\" Nicklaus told reporters afterward.JUST WATCHEDGolf in India: The growth of the gameReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHGolf in India: The growth of the game 22:29The magic dust has since dried up, at least in majors. He won the PGA Tour's season-long FedEx Cup in 2016, but a rib injury blew out much of 2017.However, McIlroy used the time to get married to fianc\u00e9e Erica Stoll and take stock of his life and career.Refreshed, McIlroy's mojo returned with victory in the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill in March amid the frenzy of Woods' latest comeback.At Augusta, however,  he started the final day in the last pairing alongside eventual winner Patrick Reed but fell back to finish fifth,  letting slip another chance to join Woods, Nicklaus, Gary Player, Ben Hogan and Gene Sarazen as bona fide legends of the game.McIlroy has never claimed to be targeting the major haul of Woods, who in turn never hid his chase of Nicklaus' 18 majors, but he does have his eyes on another target: the seven majors of Jersey man Harry Vardon.   \"He wants to become Europe's most successful golfer of all time,\" says O'Donoghue.  If inspiration strikes, Woods might need to look at the figure roaring up in his rear view mirror.",

Globally, plastic bottles make up a third of marine litter, adding to the 5 trillion pieces of plastic already polluting the oceans.Last week, the UK government released a report warning that without intervention, the amount of plastic swirling in the world's oceans is expected to triple within a decade.Of the estimated 13 billion plastic bottles used in the UK each year, 5.5 billion escape household recycling collection.Ocean plastic predicted to triple within a decade\"We can be in no doubt that plastic is wreaking havoc on our marine environment -- killing dolphins, choking turtles and degrading our most precious habitats,\" UK environment secretary Michael Gove said in a statement.Read More\"It is absolutely vital we act now to tackle this threat and curb the millions of plastic bottles a day that go unrecycled.\"Incentive to recycle?Similar deposit-return systems operate in a number of countries including Sweden, Germany, Finland and parts of the United States. While it has not been disclosed how much the refundable deposit will be in the UK, consumers in other parts of the world pay approximately $0.10 to $0.50.Businesses are then responsible for ensuring returned containers are effectively recycled -- a move the UK government says has led to a 97% recycling rate in Germany.Deposit-return schemes around the world sometimes use \"reverse vending machines\" as collection points for drinks containers.Returpack, the primary deposit organization in Sweden, cites a recycling rate of 85% for both PET bottles and aluminum cans.In Finland, the largest deposit-refund system operator -- Suomen Palautuspakkaus Oy -- achieved return rates from 89% to 95% for beverage packaging in 2015.South Australia's container deposit scheme sees an overall return rate of 80%.

But we also need to tackle the flow of plastic waste at the source,\" Greenpeace UK oceans campaigner Elena Polisano told CNN. \"We're churning out more single-use plastic than our recycling system can cope with and are then forced to bury it, burn it, or ship it off abroad. This isn't sustainable. As well as trying to change consumers' behavior, the UK government should also put pressure on producers and sellers to change theirs. \"This means finding incentives for companies to produce and sell less throwaway plastic and look at alternative solutions. Action both upstream and downstream is key to stopping plastic waste polluting our oceans.\"",

This is when a bowler gets the ball to veer sideways as it travels through the air towards the batsman. The more a ball swings in the air, the more problems a batsman faces and, consequently, the more likely the player is to be dismissed. There are two types of swing -- conventional and reverse -- and it is all about aerodynamics.  Conventional swing happens when the ball is new and is released from the bowler's hand with the seam at an angle to the initial line of flight. Its effectiveness is also down to the technique and skill of the bowler.But as the ball gets older players will try to keep one side as shiny as possible and let the other become rough, changing the aerodynamics of the ball. The rougher they can get the worn side, the better.With the right technique, the ball will now swing away from the shiny side, which travels faster through the air. This \"reverse swing\" was pioneered by former Pakistan international Sarfraz Nawaz in the 1970s but made famous in the '80s and '90s by Pakistan's Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. It is a skill few bowlers can master.The ball tends to swing more severely than conventional swing and moves late in the delivery, making it more difficult for the batsman. Changing the ball legally and illegally World cricket's governing body -- the International Cricket Council (ICC) -- does allow players to tamper with a ball with a \"non-artificial substance,\" which usually means rubbing the ball against their trousers or using their saliva to add shine. A ball can also be roughed up naturally -- by bouncing it in from the boundary, for instance -- but there is no guarantee of damaging the same side of the ball. That is why it is tempting for bowlers and fielders to try illegitimate means to scuff the rough side of an old ball to extract more reverse swing. \"I saw an opportunity to potentially use some tape to get some granules from the rough patches on the wicket and try to change the ball condition,\" Bancroft said in a news conference. \"It didn't work.\" A Cricket Australia investigation later found he used sandpaper, not tape as he claimed.Why did Australia attempt this? They were struggling in a Test they went on to lose by 322 runs and were desperately seeking an advantage in the field.  'It's cheating, plain and simple'Sport consultant Chris Harrison told CNN that teams use varying techniques to rough up the ball. Sometimes, he said, players will use suncream to enhance the swing. \"This does not allow it to naturally deteriorate. It's cheating, plain and simple,\" he added.Bancroft (R) is questioned by Umpires Richard Illingworth (L) and Nigel Llong (C) during the third day of the third Test cricket match against South Africa But ball tampering is almost as old as the game itself and there are plenty of recent examples of players attempting to gain advantage in such a way.In 1990, New Zealand's Chris Pringle admitted using a bottle top to scratch the ball during a Test against Pakistan. Four years later, England captain Michael Atherton took dirt off the pitch, put it in his pocket and was caught on camera using it on the ball. Atherton was fined $2800 by the England Cricket Board, but it wasn't until 2000 that a player was fined and suspended by the ICC for the offense. The bowler in question was Pakistan's Younis, found guilty of ball tampering in a limited-overs match against South Africa after TV footage showed him apparently using his fingernails to scratch one side of the ball. Four years later, India's Rahul Dravid was fined 50% of his match fee after being caught on camera applying lozenge on the ball while playing Zimbabwe. More recently, in 2016, South Africa's Faf du Plessis was fined 100% of his match fee and given three demerit points after he was seen sucking on candy, sticking his fingers into his mouth and then using his saliva to shine the ball. He had also been fined in 2013 for ball tampering.",

Authorities said 64 people died, 41 of them children. Crowds in Vladivostok let go of balloons in memory of the Kemerovo shopping mall fire victims. Grieving family members clutched flowers and photographs of young schoolchildren at the first funerals held for victims. Investigators have so far released 21 bodies for burial.The chairman of Russia's federal investigating authority, the Investigative Committee, has indicated that a short circuit or bad wiring could be to blame for the blaze, state news agency RIA-Novosti reported. Investigators said the mall's fire exits were blocked and an alarm system turned off. A shopping mall security guard, who investigators believe failed to turn on the fire alarm, was arrested on Wednesday, state news agency Tass reported. Earlier, he told press that the alarm was out of order. He is one of two arrested and three detained in connection with the case so far.Read MoreRussian President Vladimir Putin visits a memorial for the victims of the fire on Tuesday.President Vladimir Putin, who flew to the city to offer his condolences to the victims' families, declared a national day of mourning for Wednesday. Putin blamed the blaze on \"criminal negligence\" and promised that those responsible would be held accountable. The Kemerovo fire comes at a delicate domestic political moment for Putin, who sailed to a re-election victory on March 18. As the scandal over the fire tragedy unfolded, Western allies led by the UK, EU and the US announced a coordinated expulsion of more than 100 Russian diplomats in response to the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain. The UK blames Russia for the attack on the spy; the Kremlin has denied any involvement.Thousands of distraught locals demonstrated on Tuesday outside the municipal building in Kemerovo, demanding the ouster of officials, chanting: \"Resign\" and \"Murderers!\" They alleged that the official death toll has been drastically underestimated, Tass reported. Women grieve at a funeral service in Kemerovo on Wednesday.Anger boiled over at a vigil in Moscow, spawning a political demonstration. Protesters held banners reading: \"Bribes kill children\" and \"We are all burning,\" with chants of \"The authorities must answer!\" and \"Putin resign!\" ringing out over the crowd. But Russian authorities said that no one was unaccounted for in the fire, Tass reported. And the committee investigating the blaze accused Ukrainian blogger Nikita Kuvikov, a prankster who calls himself Yevgeny Volnov, of spreading false information about the death toll.A city grieves  People mourn over a coffin during a funeral in Kemerovo.Kemerovo, a city of about half a million people, has been left reeling by the tragedy -- one of the deadliest blazes in Russia in recent years, according to state media.Harrowing accounts have emerged in recent days about the chaos that ensued as the fire engulfed the converted Soviet-era sweet factory, sweeping through a children's play area and movie complex on the shopping center's top floor.Witnesses described panicked scenes as shoppers attempted to flee -- some jumping out of windows of the four-story building. A number of the victims, many of them children, died inside a locked movie theater. Anna Zarechneva, who was in the mall's cinema when the fire broke out, said moviegoers had little warning until the blaze was well underway. \"No fire alarm to be heard. The crowd broke through one narrow door. The second exit for some reason was closed,\" Zarechneva wrote on Instagram.A victim of the Kemerovo fire is buried at the Kirovskoye cemetery. A father who lost his daughter in the fire recalled her final words: \"She said, 'Dad, I love you. I'm suffocating, I'm fainting.'\"A number of children stuck inside the mall shared goodbye messages on Russian social-media platform VKontake before their accounts went silent.One fifth-grade student, Maria Moroz, posted: \"We're burning.

Sacha Ghozlan, director of the Jewish group, said that among the messages were \"Zionist place\" and \"death to Israel.\"",

Thompson was hit with a four-stroke penalty -- two for the infringement and two for signing an incorrect scorecard. From two ahead with seven to play she was behind and shaken up.Despite the tears streaming down her face, Thompson rallied to force a playoff but eventually lost in sudden death to South Korea's So Yeon Rhu.Read MoreREAD: Lexi Thompson is 'addicted' to working outJUST WATCHEDLPGA  head: I feel horrible for Lexi ThompsonReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLPGA  head: I feel horrible for Lexi Thompson 00:47\"That night was extremely rough,\" she told reporters in California ahead of the 2018 ANA Inspiration.Lexi Thompson pays the price for TV viewer's intervention after misplacing ball-mark\"I was screaming, crying. You know, I've relived it for a while. I had nightmares about it -- I still occasionally do.\"Thompson said in the weeks that followed she had to stay away from social media because it was making her feel \"terrible.\"Instead, she kept to herself and spent time with family.\"I just had to let it go and let time pass,\" she added.Thompson says some time spent on her own and with family helped her recover.Since then, the rules have changed and tournament officials will no longer consider any viewer call-ins for infractions they see on TV.\"I'm just happy the rule changed so nobody else can be put through what I was put through last year,\" said Thompson. 'Ready for a new year' While Thompson couldn't help but be reminded of last year's events when she arrived in California's Palm Springs for this year's tournament, she says she's ready to put it all behind her.\"It's the past. It's 2018 and I'm ready for a new year and everybody needs to just let it go,\" she said. \"It's just an amazing atmosphere this whole event.

Under gray skies, a cavalcade of officers on motorbikes and horseback led the funeral procession through the capital toward the Hotel des Invalides, a historic building dedicated to France's servicemen and women.There French President Emmanuel Macron led the tributes to Lt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame, 45, who offered to take the place of a female hostage during an attack by an ISIS supporter on a supermarket in Tr\u00e8bes. Beltrame was stabbed in the neck and shot several times by the attacker after entering the market on Friday. He died from his wounds early Saturday.French President Emmanuel Macron touches the flag-draped coffin of Arnaud Beltrame.\"To accept to die so the innocent can live, that is what is in the heart of the soldier's commitment,\" said Macron at the ceremony honoring Beltrame.Read MoreHe added that Beltrame's willingness to give his life was \"greatness that so transfixed the whole of France.\"Republican Guards escort the hearse transporting the coffin of  Lt.

He was shot dead by police on the scene.People applaud while Beltrame's coffin passes in central Paris.  A convoy of French Republican Guards escort the hearse carrying Beltrame's coffin.The attacker killed four people in total. Along with Beltrame, two other people died and more than a dozen were wounded in the supermarket raid. He also killed another person earlier Friday while stealing a car.Police found two unexploded homemade bombs, a 7.65 mm pistol and a hunting knife when they searched the market after the attack, a French judicial source told CNN.Illustrious career as officerMarried with no children, Beltrame had served in the French military police and received a number of awards for bravery.A portrait of Beltrame is pictured during  a minute of silence at the Interior Ministry in Paris.\nHe served in Iraq in 2005, and was given an award for bravery in 2007, Macron said. For four years, he was a commander in the Republican Guard, which provides security at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, home of the French President.Last year Beltrame was appointed deputy commander of the antiterror police in the Aude region.According to the newspaper La D\u00e9p\u00eache du Midi, Beltrame led a simulated terror attack in December on a supermarket for training purposes, similar to the one Friday in which he lost his life.How the rampage unfoldedBefore arriving at the supermarket, the gunman stole a car, killing one person in the vehicle and wounding another, the interior minister said.The gunman then shot at four National Police officers who were jogging in Carcassonne. The driver tried to run the officers down. One of them was wounded, but he was not in serious condition.Police respond to the supermarket siege Friday in Tr\u00e8bes.As Friday's supermarket attack was underway, Beltrame offered to exchange himself for one of the female hostages held inside. He was shot and stabbed after entering the market. Beltrame had left his phone on so police could hear his interactions with the gunman, according to Interior Minister G\u00e9rard Collomb.As soon as they heard gunfire, police went in and killed the gunman.Terror attacks in France in recent yearsMore than 230 people have died in a series of Islamist-inspired terror attacks in France over the past three years. In January 2015, a total of 17 people were killed in attacks on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, a kosher grocery store and the Paris suburb of Montrouge. In November 2015, at least 130 were killed in attacks at several locations across the French capital. In 2016, 86 people died in Nice when a truck rammed into crowds during Bastille Day celebrations. There have also been a string of \"lone wolf\" ISIS-inspired attacks, including the killings of a priest and rabbi.France remained under a state of emergency for about two years after the Paris attacks. It was lifted late last year.This story has been updated to correct the cause and date of Beltrame's death.CNN's Stephanie Halasz contributed to this report",

        "content": "Story highlightsUS swimmer Missy Franklin won four golds at London 2012, aged 17She speaks to CNN about her battle with depression (CNN)Moments of glory for Olympic athletes are flashed around the word for all to see and share. But there's a counterpoint to the shock and awe of the photo finish or the podium wave -- when the adrenalin rush has gone and you're left dealing with the humdrum of everyday life.US swimmer Missy Franklin knows this all too well. Olympic success came to her at an early age when she stormed to four gold medals at the age of 17 at London 2012, breaking two world records in the process.Follow @cnnsport\n\nYet it turns out for Franklin that in many ways that was the easy part of being an elite athlete, as she subsequently grappled with mental health issues.Six years on from her first Olympics, she has the perspective of an athlete who appreciates that life doesn't start and end in those two weeks once every four years.And having gone public about her own experiences of depression, Franklin is determined to help younger athletes learn to cope with the often overwhelming weight of Olympic expectation and what happens afterwards.Read More\"I think as role models in sport we often feel this pressure to be strong and tough all the time,\" Franklin told CNN Sport at the recent Laureus awards.\"You're these Olympic athletes, you're supposed to be really strong, you're supposed to be really confident.\"I think people sometimes forget that we're human too, and we have days when we're exhausted and not motivated and don't want to go to practice and I think it's so important for young athletes to see that.\"Missy Franklin took an astonishing four golds at London 2012, at the age of 17.'My body was useless'Franklin went into her second Olympics in Rio with expectations charged by her success in London and though she added another gold to her tally in the 4x200m freestyle, she failed to medal in any of her individual events.That meant ultimately Rio 2016 proved a disappointment for her. \"Going into Rio I was in the best physical shape of my entire life, I had the best year of training I'd ever had, and that meant nothing because mentally I was in such a terrible place that I was useless, my body was useless, I couldn't have the power or control over my thoughts that I had had before and so when that's not there it doesn't matter how much training you do.\"Franklin attributes her ability to deal with the issues she faced to two other US swimmers who talked openly about depression.\"I feel so fortunate because I had so many incredible athletes pave the way for me. I had Michael Phelps and Allison Schmitt, who were two of my really good friends and teammates for so long; both really openly talk of their depression and what they went through. I just think we need so much more of that.\" she said.Phelps spoke earlier this year about his own battles with depression, sharing his experience of severe anxiety and even contemplating suicide. Returning to the 'real world'For Phelps, Schmitt and Franklin, along with many others, depression is often linked to dealing with day-to-day life after the intensity of an event like the Olympics is over.\"You hear about so many athletes coming off and having post-Olympic depression, and it's something people don't even realize happens,\" Franklin explained. \"People watch us for two weeks and then they go back to their normal lives, and there we are having the most exhilarating two weeks of our lives, something we've trained for forever, and then it's over and the transitions that some athletes have to go through, trying to find their way in the 'real world,' trying to find a job, trying to figure out another passion for themselves after doing one thing for so long.\"Olympic medalist swimmer takes on depression with help of Phelps, othersThat transition back to the \"real world\" was the toughest part for Franklin, having taken a full year out of college ahead of the Games, but her decision to study psychology when she returned to school after Rio provided new understanding of how her own mind works.\"I learned so much about myself and other people through learning about psychology. That's not necessarily the reason I got into it but it's still so fascinating to me.\"The older you get the better you get at prioritizing and organizing so with it being a little bit harder, also comes to tools to deal with it better,\" she added.\"I think we need to start putting importance on self-confidence, on positive thinking and most importantly on perspective for athletes that are feeling so much pressure, so they understand that their value is not intrinsically placed on a medal or a time, that they're so much more than the person they are when they're competing.\"",

        "content": "London (CNN)Britain will leave the European Union on March 29, 2019 -- but quite what Brexit will entail depends on who you listen to.In the early days, Brexit supporters talked of making Britain a \"colossal success\" and forging the country's own path in the world while keeping a \"deep and special partnership\" with Europe.But now, as the reality of Brexit becomes clearer, the rhetoric has been dialed back.Starting offNewly installed as Prime Minister in July 2016, Theresa May struck a bullish tone, promising that \"Brexit means Brexit.\" At first, the slogan appeared decisive -- but in the absence of more concrete definition, it became quickly mocked.Read MoreAmid much talk of a \"hard Brexit\" or a \"soft Brexit,\" May then promised a \"red, white and blue Brexit,\" which sounded patriotic but again gave little in the way of detail. But she remained positive, insisting Britain would be leaving the European Union, rather than leaving Europe, while repeatedly advocating that \"deep and special partnership\" with the EU. Her decision to hold a snap election in June last year brought lexical complications. Instead of receiving her desired strengthened mandate, May's vote collapsed and she was forced instead into a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland to prop up her government.That deal brought a whole new raft of problems, especially the thorny issue of the Northern Irish border. Pressured for answers over the rights of European citizens, the Brexit divorce bill and Northern Ireland, May's go-to phrase became the apparently reassuring, \"nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.\"     But even with a transitional deal now agreed, Brexit politicians still face challenges that must be explained, not least the future relationship between the UK and EU.Brexit secretary David Davis, appointed as the man to lead Britain in negotiations, began by promising \"there will be no downside to Brexit, only a considerable upside.\" Fast-forward to February 2018 and the rhetoric has changed markedly, Davis instead seeking to assure that Britain will not be \"plunged into a Mad Max-style world borrowed from dystopian fiction.\"So how did Brexit move from having no downside to reassuring that the country would be saved from a \"race to the bottom\"?     In September, Davis told a UK parliamentary committee that \"nobody has ever pretended this would be simple or easy\" -- a comment met with laughter, as Liam Fox, the government's international trade secretary, had previously said exactly that.If you didn't want to take Fox's word for it, there were the comments of UKIP's Gerard Batten who said that trade relations with the EU could be sorted out in \"an afternoon over a cup of coffee.\"Or you could even listen to Davis' assertion that \"within minutes of a vote for #Brexit CEO's would be knocking down Chancellor Merkel's door, demanding access to the British market.\"European Council leader says UK's Brexit position based on 'pure illusion'You can't blame government ministers for wanting to talk things up. After all, the reality often appears so grim. Prospects of a bespoke trade deal with the EU, as Davis had promised, appear thin. Add to that the leak of government papers which suggest the UK economy would be severely hit by leaving the EU. Unfortunately, with a tendency to make unguarded off-the-cuff remarks, Davis hasn't always helped himself.\"What's the requirement of my job? I don't have to be very clever, I don't have to know that much, I do just have to be calm,\" Davis told LBC Radio in December, in an interview leapt on by his opponents.Like Davis, Fox has also courted controversy with his comments, particularly over the UK's quest to secure a free trade deal with the EU.\"The free trade agreement that we will have to do with the European Union should be one of the easiest in human history,\" he said.     Unfortunately for Fox, his prediction landed somewhat wide of the mark.Negotiations have been anything but easy. Britain has been accused of \"cherry picking\" and \"having its cake and eating it,\" while Fox's own former adviser Martin Donnelly said Brexit was like \"giving up a three- course meal for the promise of a packet of crisps.\"To continue the food analogy, Fox remains ravenous in his pursuit of trade deals and has been traveling across the globe to drum up interest.But even Fox is beginning to change his tune over the negotiations with the EU.\"I don't think they're [the negotiations] difficult in terms of the trade law or the trade negotiations themselves. The difficulty is the politics,\" he said in October 2017.Brexit is a mess because of giant political egosForeign Secretary Boris Johnson has been at the forefront of Brexit from the start. He became a central fixture in the leave campaign, steering the country out of the European Union and declaring it would be a \"Titanic success.\" (It was perhaps not the best choice of words, on reflection.)In June 2016 Johnson said that even if the UK left the EU, \"there will continue to be free trade, and access to the single market.\"Fast forward to February 2018 and Johnson is backtracking, claiming that the economic benefits of single market membership \"are nothing like as conspicuous or irrefutable as is sometimes claimed.\"     The UK government has already said it will withdraw from the single market and the customs union, rendering Johnson's remarks of June 2016 superfluous.The EU is not messing around either. EU Council President Donald Tusk says any agreement on trade between the two parties will \"make it more complicated and costly than today for all of us. This is the essence of Brexit.\"While a deal on Britain's payment of the Brexit divorce bill, rights of EU citizens and Northern Ireland was agreed in December, Johnson is only too aware of the division within public opinion.And the man who once said that Britain would make a \"titanic success\" of Brexit, has also adopted a more conciliatory tone in recent weeks.Johnson's speech on February 14 was billed as a love letter to remainers, reaching out to those who \"still have anxieties\" by telling them \"Brexit can be grounds for much more hope than fear.\"But perhaps, with just a year to go until Britain leaves the EU, the last word is best left to outspoken leave supporter and Conservative MP, Jacob Rees-Mogg. The upcoming transition period would be tough, but worth the wait: Akin to \"purgatory before getting into heaven.\"",

        "content": "London (CNN)The fire service in the UK city of Manchester arrived two hours late to the scene of a deadly suicide bombing last year and played \"no meaningful role\" in the response, a report published Tuesday has found.Suicide bomber Salman Abedi killed 22 people last year on May 22 in the foyer of an arena, as thousands of people streamed out after attending an Ariana Grande concert.An independent review, chaired by former Head of the Civil Service Lord Kerslake, illustrated how poor communications between the emergency agencies gave the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) conflicting information. The service began the wrong type of response and later set up at an incorrect \"rendezvous\" point several miles away from the scene as a result.Two fire teams were in earshot of the explosion yet did not immediately respond at or nearer to the scene, having been told it was too dangerous to do so. \"The Fire Service was effectively 'outside the loop,' having no presence at the rendezvous point established by the Police, little awareness of what was happening at the Arena and only a very limited and belated presence,\" the report found.Flowers left in St. Ann's Square on May 23, 2017, a day after the bombing.Read MoreThe fire service was heavily reliant on the police and ambulance services for information and an inter-agency officer to coordinate the different services.The fire service said in a statement Tuesday that there were clear failures in the leadership and decision-making in the response, and that the firefighters had been let down by their superiors.\"The 22nd May 2017 was Greater Manchester's darkest hour and it is clear that our response fell far short of that which the people of Greater Manchester have a right to expect. I apologize unreservedly for that,\" said Dawn Docx, the service's interim chief fire officer.\"The fundamental mistake made by the fire service that night was failing to communicate with our partner agencies and that is something at the forefront of our plans to change fundamentally the fire service and its culture.\"The report said there was no single reason or person behind the failure: \"Rather, it was a combination of poor communication and poor procedures.\"Vodafone failThe report also pointed to failure by telecommunications company Vodafone, saying that a casualty bureau it had set up \"was seriously hampered by the complete failure\" of a telephone-based communications system provided by Vodafone.\"As a consequence, communication with the families caught up in the attack was badly affected,\" the report found.It said that a dedicated telephone contact service was not set up more than four hours after the attack.\"This failure was a cause of significant stress and upset on the night to the families involved, who were seeking to find out more about the situation of their loved ones. A number were reduced to a frantic search around the hospitals of Greater Manchester to find out more.\"Tributes for the victims of the Manchester bombing at Albert Square on May 24, 2017.Vodafone, which has a contract with the government to provide dedicated phone services in emergencies, has also apologized. In a statement to CNN it admitted that a failure in one of its systems meant the Greater Manchester Police were not able to issue the dedicated number immediately after the attack.\"This was clearly unacceptable and we sincerely apologize for the distress caused to those affected by this terrible attack,\" Vodafone said in a statement sent to CNN.The report did, however, commend emergency responders, saying there was \"a lot to be proud of.\"Police and ambulance services arrived at the scene rapidly, and armed officers quickly secured the area.",

But he flitted around the fringes of it, doubling up with his other sport passion of rugby in which he played in the second row or at No.8.His brother likes to boast he never lost to his gargantuan sibling -- \"he likes to say whoever I beat, I'll never beat him,\" says Melbourne -- before switching his sporting allegiance to volleyball.That he finds himself in his current position, he says is all down to a late decision to sign up for military duty.Having done all manner of different jobs from waiter and bar manager to working in financial management for a local council.\"I didn't know what I wanted to do,\" he says. \"So, I covered the walls of the bedroom and wrote down all the possible jobs from an astronaut to a professional footballer. I needed to find something to do for the next 20 to 30 years.\"I like structure in my life so the first thing I looked at was joining the Marines.

Fire!\",\" she wrote. Zarechneva described how she grabbed her son while the movie was still playing, her partner Dima following behind.  \"No-one turned on the light in the hall. No fire alarm to be heard. The crowd broke through one narrow door. The second exit for some reason was closed (and was there a second exit at all?), and the second part of the door was also closed. Having jumped out of the cinema, we saw dense black pungent smoke, which completely filled the children's playground and the 2nd cinema hall - they were completely invisible. There was already no air,\" she wrote.She said panic nearly broke out as people tried to make their way down the stairs to the screams and cries of children.\"Adults fled pushing and crushing children. On the stairs, from time to time, the crowd also panicked, but the men quickly calmed everyone, shouting: \"Do not panic! Calm down! We will all go down!\". Someone slipped in a hurry and fell on the steps. But someone immediately helped him get back on his feet,\" she wrote.\"Some man shouted that his children were in one of the cinemas. Dima found a hat laying around, put some water on it and tried to get to the hall. But the density of the smoke was so high that the cap simply did not help. \"Do you have a gas mask? !!\" - he began to ask the distraught guard. But he just spread his hands. The attempt to get to the children was just in vain.\"Preliminary investigations point to the fire having broken out in the cinema hall area of the four-story Winter Cherry shopping mall in the center of Kemerovo.Among those taken into custody was the technical director of the building's owner, the tenant of the premises where the fire is believed to have started, the head of the organization that was responsible for servicing the fire alarm and one of his employees, the Russian Investigative Committee said in a statement.\"Serious violations were allowed, both when the shopping center opened and after, during its operation. Fire exits in the shopping center were blocked. The investigation is checking the information regarding other violations,\" said Svetlana Petrenko, spokeswoman for the Russian Investigative Committee.Early images from the scene showed thick black smoke pouring from the shopping center, a former sweet factory, as firefighters continued to battle the flames after dark.As around 100 people were evacuated, others were trapped by the fire inside. Witnesses told Russian media they saw people jumping from the windows in desperate efforts to escape.The shopping mall, which has an overall area of 23,000 square meters, opened in 2013. It has a parking lot for 250 cars, shops, a bowling, a children's center, a cinema, and a petting zoo, according to the state news agency, Tass. Rescue workers say they have checked the first and second floors and are checking the third but have had difficultly making it to the fourth floor where the fire is believed to have started.\"They can not make it through yet, as the temperature is high there,\" the first deputy head of the regional department of the Ministry of Emergencies, Evgeny Dedyukhin, told Tass. Sputnik, a state-funded news outlet, reported the head of the city's fire department Sergei Yakovlev as saying the blaze had spread via flammable thermal insulation, making it difficult to put out. It is not yet known how the inferno began. People were gathering at the scene Monday morning to lay flowers and toys, Sputnik reported.People lay flowers for the victims of a fire in a multi-story shopping center in the Siberian city of Kemerovo, about 3,000 kilometers (1,900 miles) east of Moscow, Russia, Monday, March 26, 2018. Russian officials say 20 psychologists are working with relatives of missing people. A number of world leaders send their condolences to Russia and President Vladimir Putin, including Pope Francis, who sent a telegram. \"His Holiness Pope Francis was deeply saddened to learn of the fire which struck the Winter Cherry complex in Kemerovo, and he offers heartfelt condolences to all those affected by this tragedy,\" the Pope wrote.\"Entrusting the deceased, especially the many children who lost their lives, to the merciful love of God Almighty, His Holiness offers the assurance of his prayers for all who mourn their loss. With the assurance of his spiritual closeness to the authorities and emergency personnel as they assist the injured and continue their search for the missing, Pope Francis invokes upon all the divine blessings of peace and consolation.\"German Chancellor Angela Merkel wrote: \"The people of Germany and I personally have heard about the appalling news regarding the serious fire disaster in Kemerovo which has claimed so many dead and injured people. \"We mourn with you. Our thoughts are with the victims and their relatives.''",

The three Australians have been handed lengthy bans in an attempt to restore \"integrity\" and rebuild the reputation of the sport in Australia in the wake of a ball-tampering scandal.Smith, the national team captain, and vice captain David Warner have been banned from playing for the national side for a year following their roles in the incident that caused national outrage during the third Test against South Africa. Cameron Bancroft was given a nine-month ban for using sandpaper to rough the ball illegally.Read MoreFollow @cnnsport\n\nOn Saturday, Smith and Bancroft admitted during a post-match press conference that they'd conspired to scuff the ball in an attempt to gain an unfair advantage over South Africa. A Cricket Australia investigation found the trio were the only ones who knew of the plan, which was concocted during the lunch break and carried out by young fielder Bancroft, who had played just eight Test matches. The probe found Warner guilty of \"developing\" the idea and for giving \"instruction to a junior player to carry out a plan to take steps to attempt to artificially alter the condition of the ball using sandpaper.\"Steve Smith was stripped of the captaincy and sent home from South Africa after admitting to cheating.How Australia cheating scandal harms national psycheIt also found Smith and Bancroft guilty of making \"misleading public comments\" when they claimed it was grit-covered yellow tape, not sandpaper.Along with the suspensions, both Smith and Bancroft will not be considered for any leadership positions until after 12 months and Warner will \"not be considered for team leadership positions in the future,\" CA said in a statement.\"Any consideration of future leadership would be conditional on acceptance by fans and the public, form and authority among the playing group\"READ: What is ball tampering in cricket?Coach keeps jobAll three players, who were already being sent home from South Africa, will also have to complete 100 hours of voluntary service in community cricket before being considered for future selection.However they \"will be permitted to play club cricket and will be encouraged to do so to maintain links with the cricket community,\" CA added.But Sutherland dismissed rumors that coach Darren Lehman was resigning.\"No other players or support staff had prior knowledge, including Darren Lehman, who has not resigned and will continue to coach under current contract,\" Sutherland said.Australian fielder Cameron Bancroft was questioned by umpires during the third day of the third Test between South Africa and Australia.The three players will be replaced by Matthew Renshaw, Glenn Maxwell and Joe Burns for the fourth Test against South Africa, with Tim Paine appointed captain.David Peever, the chairman of Cricket Australia, said the board \"shares the anger of fans and the broader Australian community about these events.\"\"They go to the integrity and reputation of Australian Cricket and Australian sport and the penalties must reflect that,\" he said.\"These are significant penalties for professional players and the Board does not impose them lightly. It is hoped that following a period of suspension, the players will be able to return to playing the game they love and eventually rebuild their careers.\"CA CEO James Sutherland added that details of an independent review into the conduct and culture of the men's cricket team will also be shared in \"due course.\"Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar called the ban the \"right decision\" in a tweet on Wednesday. \"Cricket has been known as a gentleman's game.

Australian cricket great Shane Warne said he was \"shocked\" by the incident but questioned the severity of the punishment. \"The jump to hysteria is something that has elevated the offence beyond what they actually did, and maybe we're at a point where the punishment just might not fit the crime,\" he said in an article for Australia's Daily Telegraph. The punishment handed down to Smith, Warner and Bancroft has been criticised as 'too harsh' by some.Former England captain Michael Vaughan agreed.\"Steve Smith, I think, is a good guy who made a huge mistake,\" he tweeted. \"He needed punishing but I think this is too harsh.\"Bancroft, who I don't know, was led astray but deserved punishing, but again too harshly in my opinion.\" Steve Smith I think is a good guy who made a huge mistake ...

        "content": "Moscow (CNN)Russian President Vladimir Putin is often credited with being a master tactician. But in his country's response to the alleged nerve agent attack in the UK, he may have overplayed his hand.  These are all the countries that are expelling Russian diplomatsIn a concerted move on Monday, the United States, Canada, member states of the European Union and Ukraine expelled more than 100 Russian diplomats, backing the UK in what British Prime Minister Theresa May called the \"the largest collective expulsion of Russian intelligence officers in history.\"For years, Western officials have complained of Russian spy games, and the Kremlin's ability to sow doubt and confusion with propaganda and spin. At first, Russia's response to the attack in the English city of Salisbury followed that predictable script. Read MoreAfter May said Russia was \"highly likely\" responsible for the attempted murder of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury earlier this month, Russian officials responded with denials.\"A circus show,\" scoffed Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. \"Nonsense,\" said Russian President Vladimir Putin, adding that Russia had no motive to poison on the eve of presidential elections and the World Cup. Military personnel wearing protective suits remove a police car from a parking lot as they investigate the poisoning.Then there were the contradictory accounts. Russia said it had destroyed its chemical-weapons stockpiles; it said it had no weapon codenamed Novichok, the nerve agent the UK says was used in the attack. A Russian scientist gave an interview to state media claiming to have worked on Novichok, but a key passage was subsequently redacted online to read: \"A program for creating a chemical weapon called Novichok did not exist.\" And then there were the conspiracy theories: The Skripal case was a plot to sabotage the World Cup; the British, the Slovaks, the Czech, the Swedes or even the Americans could be suspected of cooking up the stuff. Russia warns of retaliation after at least 100 diplomats expelled worldwideTo many observers, it seemed similar to the theories thrown out by Russian state media and Russian officials in the wake of the downing of MH-17 in 2014: competing narratives thrown out like chaff to distract and confuse.And the timing of the international response riled some Russian observers. Russia on Wednesday will observe a period of mourning after a tragic fire in a shopping mall in the Siberian city of Kemerovo, an incident that claimed dozens of lives. Putin traveled to Kemerovo to meet with grieving families and focused his public remarks Tuesday on the tragedy. In an interview published Tuesday in the respected business newspaper Kommersant, US Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman expressed condolences to the Russian people. But asked why the US and its allies moved, even as the Salisbury investigation continued, Huntsman made it clear something had changed. Washington and its allies, he seemed to suggest, were fed up with the lying. Huntsman said he saw from the Russian side \"a sea of disinformation, making it very hard for people to tell fact from fiction. So we've had to rely, as the UK, on their own rigorous approach to the facts that they know and the rigorous investigation. We have great trust in what they have done and what they will do.\"",

Mireille Knoll was stabbed 11 times in her apartment in the 11th arrondissement of Paris before her home was set on fire, according to government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux, who recounted the attack on Twitter. Her body was discovered in her apartment on Friday. Two men are suspected of carrying out the attack, one of them being Knoll's 27-year-old neighbor, who was previously jailed for sexually assaulting the daughter of Knoll's domestic helper, the judicial source told CNN.The other is a 21-year-old homeless man, who was known to police for acts of violence. The source did not name the men.The two men have been indicted for \"voluntary homicide because of the true or supposed religion of the victim, theft aggravated by three circumstances and degradation of the property of others by a dangerous means,\" the same source said earlier.The apartment block in the 11th arrondisement of Paris where Mireille Knoll lived.Read MoreKnoll evaded the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup, which was ordered by Nazi occupiers in 1942 and resulted in the mass arrest of 13,000 French Jews, according to French lawmaker Meyer Habib, Reuters reported.

Putin blamed the blaze on \"criminal negligence\" and promised that those responsible would be held accountable. Authorities said 64 people died, 41 of them children.The fire tore through the Winter Cherry shopping mall on Sunday, the first weekend of spring school holidays, trapping many families who had gathered at a children's play area and movie theater there.

The most famous and (previously) popular athlete in Australia has had his previously untouchable reputation destroyed, and his position as captain of the most prestigious sporting team in the nation made untenable. He has earned the wrath of the Prime Minister, made everyone forget for a moment how unpopular the PM is, and evoked a nationwide reaction of disgust. Steve Smith has admitted that the national cricket team is cheating. Follow @cnnsport\n\nOnly months after being feted as the best since Don Bradman -- we'll explain that in a second -- he's become the most loathed athlete in the land. Without exaggeration, it's been an extraordinary and scandalous demise. Read MoreSome context. Cricket is to Australia what baseball is to America and what football is to Brazil. Bradman is Australia's version of Babe Ruth or Pel\u00e9 - the greatest of all time, and the benchmark by which future athletes are measured. As well as being the best cricketer in a cricket-mad nation, Smith was captain of its national team. It's long been said down here that the position of Australian cricket captain was second only to the prime ministership. That was until former Prime Minister John Howard, a famous \"cricket tragic,\" declared that the nation's cricket captain was its real representative. So, the 28-year-old Smith had the keys to every city ... until 48 hours ago. Until an incident that is front-page news, back-page news, every-page news from Darwin to Dunedoo. What the papers say... 'A day of national shame'The Australian team was playing a five-day Test match against South Africa in Cape Town. Television footage showed Cameron Bancroft, one of Smith's inexperienced teammates, using a sandpaper-like strip of tape to scuff up the ball. That's a no-no in cricket, a big one, and all hell has broken loose. To make matters worse for this sports-obsessed country, Smith revealed to the media that it was all his idea. When Australians woke to the news we nearly choked on our cornflakes. The best since Bradman had admitted to cheating. Australians howl at offenders from other countries but now it's one of our own. \"It's a day of national shame,\" ex-Australia cricketer Jimmy Maher bemoaned, even as Smith claimed he was still the right man to lead the team.Cameron Bancroft (right) throws the ball to umpire Richard Illingworth. You know it's big when the prime minister gets involved. Malcolm Turnbull is coming off 29 straight disapproval ratings but he had no hesitation in saying how much he disapproved of Smith and the actions of the Australian team, whose signature uniform is topped off by the so-called \"baggy green\" caps. \"We all woke up this morning shocked and bitterly disappointed by the news from South Africa,\" Turnbull said. \"It seemed completely beyond belief that the Australian cricket team had been involved in cheating. After all, our cricketers are role models and cricket is synonymous with fair play.\" \"How can our team be engaged in cheating like this? It beggars belief. I have to say that to the whole nation, who holds those who wear the baggy green up on a pedestal, about as high as you can get in Australia ... this is a shocking disappointment. It's wrong, and I look forward to Cricket Australia taking decisive action soon,\" Turnbull said.Cricket Australia, the governing body, did exactly that. Smith and his vice-captain, the combustible Dave Warner, were stood down from their leadership positions for the last day of the match at Cape Town, which Australia lost. Smith was suspended from the next Test by the International Cricket Council, the sport's world body. Cricket Australia boss James Sutherland dispatched senior officials to South Africa to interview the players and investigate before deciding on further punishment. \"This is a very sad day for Australian cricket,\" Sutherland said. \"Australian cricket fans want to be proud of their cricket team. And I think that this morning they have every reason to wake up and not be proud of the Australian cricket team. I'm not happy about this at all. I feel like Australian cricket fans feel right now. We have a responsibility to take this further.\"JUST WATCHED15-year-old cricketer scores record 1,009 runsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH15-year-old cricketer scores record 1,009 runs 02:28 'Premeditated cheating'It was an extraordinarily dumb thing for Smith's team to do. At the lunch break on day three of the third Test, they agreed on a plan with unnamed senior members of the team to use the tape to change the condition of the ball. The color of the tape? Bright yellow! As if that would not stand out enough! Bancroft used the small strip of tape to scuff up the ball to make it swing more than it should. Australia captain Steve Smith faces the media in South Africa.\n The more the ball swings, the harder it is for a batsman to hit and score from, and the more likely it is to get him out. South Africa's bowlers were getting a lot of swing, and Australia's were not. Ball-tampering is forbidden in elite cricket, park cricket, backyard cricket, any cricket. It's in direct contravention of the laws of the game. It's so obviously wrong that a 12-year-old school kid would baulk at doing it.TV cameras were virtually guaranteed to bust Bancroft, which they did in what played out like a scene from Dumb and Dumber. The reaction at home ranged from disbelief to disappointment to frustration to anger. And now Smith is no longer best known for his batsmanship.\"I'm not proud of what's happened,\" he told reporters. Soon, his predecessors weighed in. Australia's Cameron Bancroft (right) is questioned by umpires Richard Illingworth (left) and Nigel Llong.\"It is premeditated cheating,\" said former captain Michael Clarke. \"It's blatant cheating. It's disgraceful and it's not accepted by anyone. \" Cricket legend Allan Border wrote in a column for Fox Sports Australia: \"It's hard to explain your emotions when it comes to seeing the Australian team doing something like this. You just feel embarrassed and disappointed ... they've got to suffer the consequences. It's as simple as that. It's like any situation, you do the crime you've got to do the time.\"   READ: Kapil Dev, the cricket legend who's turned to golf'Don't do it!'The incident has drawn comparisons to another groan-inducing episode in Australian cricketing history: Bowler Trevor Chappell's infamous underarm delivery at a crucial match-deciding moment against New Zealand in 1981.Australia's 56-Test player Simon Katich felt \"sick to the stomach\" and insisted Smith, Warner and coach (and former national team member) Darren Lehmann should all be sacked. \"They (Cricket Australia) have got no option but to stand and then sack Smith, Warner and Lehmann,\" said Katich. \"They've got no option because this was premeditated and calculated at the break and those guys are in charge of Cameron Bancroft behaving the way he did. It's a bigger problem than that, he's been instructed to do this and anyone in cricket knows the captain and coach are in control of what happens in the team. \"I love Steve Smith ... but unfortunately he's made a serious error and I think it's going to cost him the captaincy of Australia.\"For a country whose national psyche is wrapped up in the fortunes of its national cricketing team, this blow will take longer to recover from than most pundits are willing to speculate. Chappell played three Tests for Australia but he's only really known for the underarm delivery he rolled along the ground to New Zealand's Brian McKechnie in 1981. It was a last-minute decision that prevented McKechnie from being able to hit a six to tie the match. His older brother and the Australian captain, Greg Chappell, asked him before the final delivery of the match if he was any good at underarm bowling. Trevor replied that he did not know because he had never done it. Greg told him, \"Well, you're about to find out.\" Trevor did as big brother instructed. McKechnie blocked the ball and then threw his bat in disgust. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news and featuresAustralia won the match but was booed from the field at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. NZ Prime minister Robert Muldoon called it the \"most disgusting incident I can recall in the history of cricket.\" On a day that scarred Australian cricket, one player had attempted to prevent it: Rod Marsh, the wicketkeeper. He folded his arms, shook his head and shouted the two words that Bancroft or someone else inside the Australian dressing room should have told Smith at Cape Town, \"No, mate! Don't do it!\"",

Finally, after a race four decades in the making, Brazilian jockey Jorge Ricardo had eclipsed his long-time rival Russell Baze, making the world record for career victories his own. Follow @cnnsport\n\n\"It is a dream and a goal fulfilled,\" Ricardo told CNN Winning Post.  \"I've wanted the world record for many years. I held it twice -- in 2009 and 2013 -- but due to illness and injury I lost it. \"Well, now I've won it back again. For me it is true happiness and the truth is, I feel very complete.\" Ricardo greets well-wishers having matched Baze's world record.Ricardo's victory, aboard the aptly-named \"Hope Glory\" on February 7, was number 12,845 of a remarkable career that has seen him emerge from relative obscurity to claim global headlines. Read MoreAlong the way he has overcome broken bones and a bout with cancer. But even through the darkest days, the 56-year-old has never once considered walking away, once commenting \"only death\" could keep him for realizing his dream. \"It never crossed my mind not to ride again,\" Ricardo told CNN. \"Both when I had the illness and the accident, I always had a positive attitude and I knew that I was going to run again.\" READ: Inside Argentina's jockey schoolA four-decade, cross-continental rivalryOver 41 years on from his first win, secured at Brazil's Hippodrome de Gavea in the shadow of Christ the Redeemer, Ricardo says he has his fiercest rival to thank for his record breaking achievements.It has been Baze, a Canadian jockey three years his senior, that has driven the boy from Rio de Janeiro to continue racing long after most would have retired.Ricardo broke into tears of joy upon matching his long-time rival's record, promptly going on to break it. Baze departed the circuit in 2016 on 12,844 victories, having frequently traded the record with his South American counterpart. No other jockey in the world has even accumulated 10,000, putting their dual-hemisphere contest on a plane of its own.They've rarely met, still less on the racetrack, but their bond has transcended the miles between them. \"He is the man who inspired me to move forward,\" Ricardo told reporters having clinched the decisive number. \"He is a great person without whom I would not have achieved what I achieved. \"I have respect for an incredible professional who is as much the owner of this record as I am.\"READ: Meet Bryony Frost, the female jockey outriding the menSouth America's richest raceThe numbers are staggering.

With an estimated 70,000 appearances to his name, he was named Brazil's jockey of the year 26 years in succession, often winning over 400 races in a single season.Ricardo previously held the record in 2009 and 2013, only to lose it to his rival, Russell Baze. Now he has it back again.  Rarely traveling abroad for the sport's most prestigious events, Ricardo has nonetheless won his continent's richest race, the Longines Gran Premio Latinoamericano, a record five times. No other jockey has done so on more than three occasions.  \"It's not easy to win five Latinos because there's only one race per year and often you don't have a chance to participate,\" he said. \"And, well, to have had the luck to win the race five times against all of the best horses in South America is perhaps the biggest achievement of my career.\" READ: How the Irish came to rule the 'Olympics' of jump racingSacrificeNaturally, though, a trophy cabinet so well-stocked has necessitated no small about of sacrifice.

Ricardo doesn't regret the many sacrifices he and his family have had to make.With his name in the record books, the jockey wouldn't have it any other way. \"I believe that in every activity and in every sport there are always sacrifices,\" said Ricardo. \"Whether it's going to bed early, not being able to go out, or share something with someone. \"But I am very happy and I don't regret all the little sacrifices I may have had to make.\" With Baze now retired, Ricardo's record may never be broken...

        "content": "(CNN)The captain and vice-captain of Australia's national cricket team resigned in the middle of a Test match Sunday over a ball-tampering scandal.Pressure had been building on captain Steve Smith after teammate Cameron Bancroft was caught on camera pulling tape from his pocket and rubbing it on the ball on day three of the third Test against South Africa Saturday.The scandal caused outrage in Australia and prompted widespread calls for a full investigation from fans, former players, official sporting bodies and senior politicians including Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.On Sunday, the resignations of Smith and vice-captain David Warner were announced in a statement from Cricket Australia.\"Following discussions with Steve Smith and David Warner they have agreed to stand down as Captain and Vice-Captain respectively for the remainder of this Test match,\" said CEO James Sutherland.Read More\"Cricket Australia and Australian cricket fans expect certain standards of conduct from cricketers representing our country, and on this occasion these standards have not been met.\"Tim Paine took over the captaincy for the rest of the Test match, which South Africa went on to win by the overwhelming margin of 322 runs to take a 2-1 lead in the four-match series.In a news conference earlier Smith, 28, admitted to concocting a plan to tamper with the ball, by rubbing dirt onto the surface to cause it to swerve unpredictably in the air. The method goes against cricket's code of conduct and is considered illegal within the sport.Later on Sunday, the International Cricket Council -- the sport's governing body -- suspended Smith for one match and took away his match fee, while Bancroft, 25 was fined 75% of his match fee, warned for his part in the affair as well as being hit by three demerit points.Australian fielder Cameron Bancroft (R) is questioned by Umpires Richard Illingworth and Nigel Llong during the third day of the third Test cricket match between South Africa and Australia on March 24, 2018 in Cape Town.

I'm not proud of what's happened. It's not within the spirit of the game.\"Smith vowed at the time he would not resign. \"I won't be considering stepping down.... I still think I'm the right person for the job,\" he said.\"Today was a big mistake on my behalf and on the leadership group's behalf as well but I take responsibility as the captain.\"Player 'panicked' when caught on cameraBancroft told reporters he \"panicked\" when he realized his tampering had been spotted on camera, and shoved the yellow tape that he'd pressed against the ball down his trousers. \"I saw an opportunity to potentially use some tape to get some granules from the rough patches on the wicket and try to change the ball condition,\" Bancroft said. \"It didn't work.\"Turnbull has shared his dismay over the ball tampering scandal, while the Australian Sports Commission called on Cricket Australia to act immediately.Turnbull said he woke up \"shocked and bitterly disappointed\" after hearing the news of what had unfolded. He said he had spoken to Cricket Australia chairman David Peever to discuss the incident.\"It seemed completely beyond belief that the Australian cricket team had been involved in cheating,\" he told reporters while visiting the aftermath of a town affected by recent bushfires in Australia.\"After all, our cricketers are role models. And cricket is synonymous with fair play.\"While he did not call for Smith to resign he said thought there should be \"decisive action\" soon.Shortly after Turnbull's comments the Australian Sports Commission issued a strongly worded statement calling on Cricket Australia to stand down the key players involved in the scandal.The team's head of integrity Iain Roy and performance manager Pat Howard are traveling to South Africa Sunday to investigate what happened.\"This is a sad day for Australian cricket,\" he said. \"I was extremely disappointed and shocked to hear the news this morning after the events in Cape Town yesterday,' he said.\"We regard this is as an extremely serious issue,\" he added.As the scandal grew in Australia the hashtag #sandpapergate began trending on Twitter and former cricket players tweeted their disappointment over the team's behavior.Clarke: 'It's blatant cheating'Former Australian captain Michael Clarke, who expressed his anger on Twitter, later told Sports Sunday, on the Nine network, said he believed Smith would be \"sitting in his hotel room in tears.\"\"I can't believe the leadership group has made the decision to do this, that they've gone and got the young kid who's played is eighth test match to do that... It's pre-meditated cheating, it's blatant cheating.\"WHAT THE ........ HAVE I JUST WOKEN UP TO. Please tell me this is a bad dream.\u2014 Michael Clarke (@MClarke23) March 24, 2018\n\nThe scandal occurred Saturday as South Africa strengthened their hold on the Third Test, building up a big overall lead in their second innings.Ball tampering is taken very seriously and results in a level two charge under ICC rules.The incident could lead to Bancroft from being suspended from the fourth Test in Johannesburg next week.Peter FitzSimons, author and commentator, writing Sunday in an opinion piece in the Sydney Morning Herald, said what happened in South Africa was a \"horror.\"\"The horror of what happened in South Africa overnight was just how our national cricketing leadership could engage in such cold-blooded, premeditated , clear-eyed CHEATING. \"..It's wrong! It is not only against the spirit of the game, but is so far the other side of the laws of the game, it's nudging up against the murder of cricket.\"He said not only was it wrong for Smith to \"put the idea out there\" but that no one around him had spoken up.In other news kudos to the @SuperSportTV cameramen for their fantastic attention to detail \ud83d\udccc\u2014 Rick Schroeder (@RickySchroeder9) March 24, 2018\nRoland Perry, Australian-based cricket expert and author, told CNN that, although the scandal showed a \"lack of integrity,\" it wasn't as serious as other incidents which have hit the sport, including allegations of match-fixing.\"It's a stupid thing they've done and they've got caught but at least they owned up to it -- many don't,\" Perry said.\"I've been watching players get away with ball tampering for 50 years, so in my view what you are getting is a bit of a storm in a tea cup.\"Hopefully, because of the outrage it's causing, it will put others off in the future.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg took out full-page ads in several British and American newspapers Sunday to apologize for a \"breach of trust\" in the Cambridge Analytica scandal.\"You may have heard about a quiz app built by a university researcher that leaked Facebook data of millions of people in 2014,\" said the ads signed by Zuckerberg, referring to the political consultancy company accused of manipulating Facebook data during the 2016 US election.\"This was a breach of trust, and I'm sorry we didn't do more at the time. We're now taking steps to ensure this doesn't happen again,\" read the ads appearing in the UK's The Observer, The Sunday Times, Mail on Sunday, Sunday Mirror, Sunday Express and Sunday Telegraph, along with American newspapers The New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal. Mark Zuckerberg's apology comes after the company's value plunged by almost $50 billion last weekThe ads, featuring black text on a white background with the Facebook logo, said the social media company was now \"limiting the data apps get\" when users sign in, and was also \"investigating every single app that had access to large amounts of data before\" it fixed the problem.According to the ad, Facebook will be reminding users which apps they'd previously given access to, giving them the opportunity to \"shut off the ones you don't want anymore.\"Read More\"I promise to do better for you,\" said Zuckerberg, who has come under harsh criticism for the scandal which sent the company's value plunging by almost $50 billion last week.What is Cambridge Analytica accused of?The ads come as Facebook announced last week it was suspending Cambridge Analytica's account over concerns the firm violated the social media site's policies. It followed reports from The New York Times and UK's The Observer newspaper (the Sunday edition of The Guardian) that Cambridge Analytica allegedly harvested  the personal information of more than 50 million users.Now Cambridge Analytica, which worked for Donald Trump's presidential campaign, is being accused of using that data in strategies for the US 2016 election.Inside the Trump campaign's ties with Cambridge AnalyticaCambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied that the firm used any of Facebook's data in the work it did for Trump's campaign. The company also said it deleted the data when Facebook alerted them in 2015 that it had been improperly shared.Facebook said the data in question was properly gathered a few years ago by psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan, who said he was using it for academic purposes.But then the information was later transferred to third parties, including Cambridge Analytica. The transfer violated Facebook policies.What is the fallout? Scrutiny of Cambridge Analytica is growing as top officials from the firm claimed credit for President Donald Trump's stunning 2016 victory. Last week, the embattled analytics company suspended its CEO, Alexander Nix, in the wake of a UK Channel 4 report showing undercover footage of Nix claiming he met Trump \"many times\" and that the company was responsible for a wide swath of the Trump campaign's activity.On Friday, the company's offices in London were searched by enforcement officers from the United Kingdom's Information Commissioner's Office, following reports the organization had been harvesting data.What's Steve Bannon got to do with it?Cambridge Analytica was the creation of conservative billionaire Robert Mercer and conservative activist Steve Bannon, who later helped run the Trump campaign and served as chief strategist in the White House. According to The Guardian, Bannon said at a conference Thursday that he \"didn't even know about the Facebook mining.\"Is there a Brexit connection?On Sunday, the controversy surrounding Cambridge Analytica began to engulf to Britain's 2016 Brexit referendum.Brexit campaigner Shahmir Sanni told Channel 4 that the British referendum's \"Vote Leave\" campaign spent over its legal limit by using the Canadian data firm called Aggregate IQ -- adding that the company had links to Cambridge Analytica.British election law enforces a spending cap on donations, however Sanni claims a donation of \u00a3625,000 ($883,000) by Vote Leave to another Brexit group, \"BeLeave,\" was funneled to AIQ.Former Brexit volunteer alleges campaign 'cheated'Channel 4 says it has seen documents that it claims show multiple ties between AIQ and Cambridge Analytica's parent company, SCL.However, attorneys for AIQ have distanced themselves from Cambridge Analytica, saying in a statement to Channel 4, \"AggregateIQ has never entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica.\" An attorney for Vote Leave also told Channel 4 that the campaign had \"twice been cleared on this matter by the Electoral Commission,\" but acknowledged the network's report presented new allegations and said it would investigate.CNN's Sophie Tatum, Hilary Clarke and Katie Polglase contributed to this report",

Arnaud Beltrame in a 2013 photo. Interior Minister G\u00e9rard Collomb said the officer, a lieutenant colonel with the National Police, offered to exchange himself for one of the female hostages being held inside the Super U supermarket in Tr\u00e8bes. When the officer went inside the supermarket, shots were fired. The lieutenant colonel had his phone on, so police could hear his interactions with the gunman, Collomb said. As soon as they heard gunfire, police went in.The gunman was killed and the officer, identified by a source close to the investigation as Arnaud Beltrame, was seriously wounded.Read MoreThe Interior Ministry identified the gunman as 26-year-old Redouane Lakdim, who was known to authorities for minor crimes including drug offenses, Collomb said.An investigation has been opened into murder and attempted murder \"in connection with a terrorist in Tr\u00e8bes,\" the French prosecutor's office told CNN.Police have taken into custody a woman who was \"very close\" to Lakdim and \"shared his life,\" prosecutor Fran\u00e7ois Molins told reporters at a news conference in Carcassonne.Police respond to the hostage situation Friday in the southern French town of Tr\u00e8bes. \"Our country has suffered an Islamist terrorist attack,\" President Emmanuel Macron told reporters. \"We've paid the price of the danger of the terrorist threat in blood for several years.\"I want to state my absolute determination to the nation to lead this fight.\"The ISIS-affiliated Amaq News Agency said that the gunman was a \"soldier\" of the militant group and that he had responded to its call to attack coalition countries, a reference to the U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Amaq offered no evidence ISIS had any contact with the attacker.\"This attack has been claimed by ISIS, and it is currently being analyzed,\" Macron said.A local prosecutor said the attack appeared to be \"ISIS-inspired,\" CNN affiliate BFM TV reported. Witnesses said the man shouted, \"I am a Daesh soldier,\" using another name for ISIS.A BFM TV reporter at the scene said the attacker claimed to be an ISIS soldier and demanded the release of Salah Abdeslam, the suspected mastermind of the November 2015 Paris attacks.CNN could not independently confirm the gunman made the demand. Abdeslam is on trial in Belgium.     France has faced a string of terrorist attacks in recent years, including the Paris attacks and other smaller-scale assaults. The country remained under a state of emergency for about two years after the Paris attacks. It was lifted late last year.  How the rampage beganThe violence unfolded when the attacker stole a car, killing one person in the vehicle and gravely wounding another, said Collomb, the interior minister.The gunman then shot at four National Police officers who were jogging in Carcassonne. The driver tried to run the officers down. One of them was wounded, but he is not in serious condition. The gunman proceeded to the Super U market. He entered the market, firing his weapon and killing two people. He took several others hostage.Police found the car, and SWAT teams surrounded the market.Collomb said a National Police lieutenant colonel shot the gunman after offering himself for at least one of the hostages.The order of the shots was unclear, Collomb said. Police raided the store after hearing gunshots. Two others were wounded at the market, an Interior Ministry spokesman said.\"People were absolutely calm before and never thought that there could be an attack in a town like this,\" Collomb told reporters, adding that the risk of terrorism in France remained \"very high.\" A Portuguese citizen was among the wounded, a spokesman for Portugal's Foreign Ministry told CNN. Madeline Fuhrman, a witness, said that Carcassonne had gone quiet after the attack.\"It's totally deserted now. Absolutely every shop is closed. There's not a soul in sight,\" she said.A supermarket employee who fled as shots were fired told BFM that he and about 50 others had been on lockdown in a car park.French police and firefighters secure parts of Tr\u00e8bes on Friday.Macron hails heroic actions of officerMacron, who was in Belgium for a summit of European Union leaders, returned to France and spoke to reporters after a crisis meeting at the Interior Ministry.French police block access to Tr\u00e8bes as they respond to the hostage situation Friday.The French leader hailed law enforcement's response.\"The forces of order intervened with remarkable speed, both to contain the individual who hid away with his hostages, to help one of the victims who was still alive who he had left in the surrounding area,\" Macron said.He singled out the officer who volunteered to be traded for a hostage and saluted his bravery.\"He has saved lives, and done his role and his country proud. He is currently fighting for his life, and all our thoughts are with him and his family,\" Macron said.Macron said the investigation should answer several questions -- when and how the gunman was radicalized and where he got a weapon.He said French soldiers overseas risk their lives \"to reduce this threat.\"CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the spelling of the interior minister's name and to correct the location of witness Madeline Fuhrman.

Lt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame, 45, was shot in the neck Friday after offering to take the place of a woman during a gunman's assault on the Super U supermarket in Tr\u00e8bes.Police found two unexploded homemade bombs, a 7.65 mm pistol and a hunting knife when they searched the market after the attack, a French judicial source told CNN. Lt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame, here in 2013, was hailed as a hero by authorities. The attacker, Radouane Lakdim, 26, a Moroccan-born French national, was a petty criminal already on the radar of French police for his links to radical Salafist networks, authorities said.

He was shot dead by police on the scene.Read More\"Lt. Col.

Illustrious career as officerMarried with no children, Beltrame had served in the French military police and received a number of awards for bravery.He served in Iraq in 2005, and was given an award for bravery in 2007, Macron said. For four years, he was a commander in the Republican Guard, which provides security at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, home of the French president. In 2012, he was knighted in France's prestigious Legion of Honor. Beltrame also was secretary-general in the Ecology Ministry for four years. Last year Beltrame was appointed deputy commander of the anti-terror police in the Aude region. According to the newspaper La D\u00e9p\u00eache du Midi, Beltrame led a simulated terror attack in December on a supermarket for training purposes, similar to the one Friday in which he lost his life.\"His leadership skills, his willingness, his unfailing commitment were appreciated by everyone, especially in the development of counterterrorism capacity in the Aude police force,\" Macron said.How the rampage unfoldedBefore the supermarket, the gunman stole a car, killing one person in the vehicle and wounding another,  the interior minister said.The gunman then shot at four National Police officers who were jogging in Carcassonne.

They've come forward in a climate in which sexual harassment is widespread, and the #MeToo movement is roundly mocked by members of parliament.Read MoreCNN spoke with Ekaterina Kotrikadze, one of the women who has openly accused Slutsky of misconduct. Leonid Slutsky attends a meeting of the State Duma on Wednesday.\"My story is, as it appears, one of many stories from female journalists covering the Duma,\" Kotrikadze, now deputy chief editor of New York-based RTVI television, told CNN.   \"He [Slutsky] invited me into his office and closed the door. Without any words or discussion, he pushed me to the wall and tried to kiss me and tried to touch me,\" said Kotrikadze, who was working for a Georgian television station at the time.  \"After that I went back to Georgia, not even thinking about declaring something publicly because the times were different. I thought that it was my fault.\" Kotrikadze broke her silence last month after two female journalists spoke out anonymously about similar incidents with Slutsky in an article on the website of Dozhd (TV Rain), an independent broadcaster.  \"Very brave women journalists in Moscow are doing the right thing,\" Kotrikadze said.  Slutsky has denied the allegations, writing on Facebook on February 23: \"Attempts to make Slutsky into a Russian Harvey Weinstein look like a cheap and crude provocation ... and are bound to fail.\"Russian media reacts  The decision to exonerate Slutsky has sparked outrage among Russian media, with a number of outlets pulling their reporters from the lower house of parliament. Moscow-based radio station Ekho Moskvy announced on Thursday that it would stop sending its journalists to the Duma, as they deemed it an unsafe place to work. The station was joined by news agency RBC, TV Rain and RTVI channel in recalling reporters entirely.  Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin responded in kind by revoking their accreditation.

The newspaper Vedomosti said its reporters won't work with Slutsky or any of the members of Duma's Ethics Committee in the future. Speaking with reporters in a daily conference call on Thursday, President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, repeatedly batted away questions about the chairman. \"Does the case of the ethical and moral behavior of the deputy Slutsky interest the Kremlin at all?\" a reporter with Bloomberg asked, following a series of questions by Kommersant and Meduza online newspaper. \"Are the norms of behavior that were considered normal in the Duma also considered normal in the Kremlin?\" Peskov refused to comment. 'They aren't going to leave this alone' While she wasn't surprised by the committee's decision, Kotrikadze said she was shocked by the language that lawmakers used in delivering the verdict. \"I was astonished by the tone and the words and attitude demonstrated yesterday,\" Kotrikadze said. \"They were trying to attack the journalists, including myself. They called us liars, they called this a political campaign timed before the elections in Russia.\" A woman protesting outside the State Duma building in Moscow on Wednesday holds a placard reading \"hands off from female journalists.\"Committee members said the timing of the complaints, which coincided with the Russian presidential election campaign, signaled \"selectivity\" on the part of the female journalists and suggested that their steps had been staged, Russia's state-run news agency Tass reported.But she was heartened by the response from other media outlets, who have banded together. \"I really think that the reaction of my colleagues, and lots of Russian media outlets, is the best thing I could imagine.

Poland is home to the toughest abortion laws in Europe. The procedure is only legal in three cases: if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, or if it endangers the life of the mother, or if the fetus is damaged. It is this third reason -- the most commonly cited -- that is the target of the latest proposals.Pro-abortion demonstrators rally in Warsaw.In 2016, urged on by Catholic groups, PiS lawmakers attempted to impose a total ban on abortion. But the law, which threatened to imprison women seeking the procedure, and any doctor who performed it, was scrapped after tens of thousands of people took to the streets in protest.  The same women's groups that rallied then were back out in force on Friday, protesting as lawmakers debated the revised bill entitled \"Stop Abortion.\"Read MoreCrowds in Warsaw were scattered with placards reading: \"Girl Power,\" \"My body, my choice,\" and \"#CzarnyPi\u0105tek\" -- the hashtag for the movement: \"Black Friday.\" Organizers with the Polish Women's Strike group estimated that some 55,000 people attended protests in the capital.  Over 200 nongovernmental organizations signed a public appeal to Polish lawmakers to reject the bill that they say \"will place women's health and lives at risk and violate Poland's international human rights obligations.\" A woman with \"Pro Abo\" face paint attends a protest against a proposed  law to tighten abortion in Warsaw.\"If adopted, this legislation will further limit the already restricted grounds on which women can lawfully access abortion in Poland,\" the letter read.The Council of Europe's human rights commissioner Nils Muiznieks issued a similar warning to Warsaw on Friday.As Poland mulls new abortion bill, women head to GermanyLawmaker Kaja Godek, a member of the committee that spearheaded the bill, claims that the legislation would halt abortions for malformed fetuses, and \"represent the lives of three human beings every day,\" Agence France-Presse reported.Now, she wants doctors to stop prenatal screening to prevent what she calls \"eugenic abortion.\" \"The original idea behind prenatal tests has been completely distorted,\" she told lawmakers in January. \"Instead of treating and preparing parents and doctors to receive a child and help him, it makes it easier to choose extermination.\" More than 96% of Poles identify as Catholic and the issue of abortion is tied not only to religion and the country's resurgent nationalist politics, but also to its history as a formerly communist country. People gather as part of \"Black Friday\" in Poznan, Poland. \"Under communism, due to a lack of access to contraception, abortion was widely practiced in Poland as a real means of contraception,\" said women's rights activist and former politician Barbara Nowacka. \"After the fall of communism, the law was tightened and now we face even more draconian measures.\" Critics of the bill, like Nowacka, are concerned what the bill will mean for women in Poland, many of whom are already traveling elsewhere in Europe for abortions.\"The underground will grow,\" she told CNN from her office in Warsaw. \"Abortion tourism. Women traveling to Czech Republic, Germany, UK and Ukraine, will grow again.\"Atika Shubert and Antonia Mortensen contributed to this report.",

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle also met local residents during a walkabout after lunch and concluded their day trip with a tour of Belfast's Titanic exhibition.Since the couple announced their engagement in November last year, they have appeared together at an awards ceremony, a charity event and for a Christmas Day service, as well as visits to London, Cardiff and Edinburgh, the UK's three other capital cities.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle interact with the crowd during their visit to Northern Ireland.Royal trips to Northern Ireland have long been fraught with tension. The nationalist community in Northern Ireland sees the British as occupiers and wants their rule in the country to end.Read MoreThere is personal history too -- Queen Elizabeth's cousin, Louis Mountbatten, was assassinated by the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1979, using a bomb planted in his fishing boat. Three others died in the same explosion.Around 3,500 lives were lost in the decades-long conflict between pro- and anti-British forces. Although the violence largely came to an end with the Good Friday peace deal in 1998, suspicions between the opposing groups remained.During their visit to Belfast, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle watched performances by local schools to celebrate how the arts can unite different communities.When the Queen visited Northern Ireland in 2012 -- following a tour of the Republic of Ireland the previous year -- and shook hands with former IRA commander Martin McGuinness, it was seen as a symbolic gesture toward peace.Meghan Markle joins Queen Elizabeth at Commonwealth Day servicePrince Harry made his own visit to Northern Ireland in September last year, when he launched the peace-building initiative being celebrated Friday and visited Hillsborough Castle, the official residence of the royal family in the province. His visit with Markle comes less than two months before their wedding in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle near London on May 19. The couple is inviting more than 2,600 people, many of them ordinary members of the public from across the UK, to watch the arrival of the bride and groom and their guests.Kensington Palace has also released details about the invitations and the cake, which will be made by London-based pastry chef Claire Ptak.",

        "content": "Prenzlau, Germany (CNN)The German clinic where Dr. Janusz Rudzinski works looks more like a country manor than a hospital, less than an hour's drive from Poland, where many of his patients come from. On a bright winter day, he checks in on \"Anja,\" who's just woken up. CNN is not using her real name because the medical procedure she's had is illegal back home in Poland: an abortion.\u00a0\"Basically, as a woman, you have no rights when it comes to reproductive rights,\" Anja says matter-of-factly, sitting up in her hospital gown. \"Because in my country it's illegal to undergo this procedure.\"\u00a0Poland has some of the most restrictive laws in Europe when it comes to abortion. An estimated 80,000 Polish women a year go abroad or seek illegal abortions at home, according to Polish women's rights groups. The procedure is legal in only three cases: if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, or if it endangers the life of the mother.\u00a0Now, the government is pushing through a new bill targeting the third and -- most commonly cited -- reason for abortion: damage to the fetus. \u00a0Women march in Warsaw in October 2017 to protest efforts by the Polish government to further restrict abortion.Read MoreLawmaker Kaja Godek has spearheaded getting the bill through parliament. Now, she wants doctors to stop prenatal screening to prevent what she calls \"eugenic abortion.\" \u00a0\"The original idea behind prenatal tests has been completely distorted,\" she told lawmakers in January. \"Instead of treating and preparing parents and doctors to receive a child and help him, it makes it easier to choose extermination.\"\u00a0More than 96% of Poles identify as Catholic and the issue of abortion here is tied not only to religion and the country's resurgent nationalist politics, but also to its history as a formerly communist country. \u00a0\"Under communism, due to a lack of access to contraception, abortion was widely practiced in Poland as a real means of contraception,\" explains women's rights activist and former politician Barbara Nowacka. \"After the fall of communism, the law was tightened and now we face even more draconian measures.\"\u00a0In 2015, the Law and Justice Party gained control of the government, ushering in a staunchly Catholic and nationalist agenda. Its lawmakers, urged on by Catholic groups, attempted to impose a total ban on abortion, drafting a law that threatened to imprison women seeking abortions and any doctor who performed the procedure. \u00a0Poland's parliament withdraws proposed abortion banTens of thousands took to the streets in protest, unifying women's groups in Poland and prompting protesting women to walk out of Sunday Masses across the country. While the government was forced to retract the proposed law, a new bill was introduced earlier this year, aimed at chipping away at the existing abortion law by eliminating one of the few ways women can legally seek an abortion. \u00a0Lawmakers will debate this bill on Friday. Women's groups are planning for street protests in 50 cities across the country. Amnesty International says \"solidarity demonstrations\" will take place in other major European cities.\u00a0For critics of the bill, like Nowacka, the concern is not just the impact on women, but how it will affect doctors, who will fear being prosecuted.\u00a0\"The underground will grow. Abortion tourism. Women traveling to Czech Republic, Germany, UK and Ukraine, will grow again,\" she told CNN from her office in Warsaw. \"What will have even more impact is that doctors are now afraid to send their patients for prenatal exams and scans.\"\u00a0Barbara Nowacka says she fears doctors will be afraid to send women for prenatal exams if the abortion law is changed. Across the border in Germany, Rudzinski says he gets roughly six Polish patients a week at his clinic, in various stages of pregnancy, seeking an abortion. Half, he says, come to him after botched abortion attempts. He recalled one particularly difficult case.''A woman called me, saying she has no money and couldn't travel but needs an abortion,\" Rudzinski said. \"She had stuck a wire inside her womb but now had a 40 degrees [Celsius] fever with extreme pain. She called asking me what to do. I told her: You may have sepsis, you need to go to hospital immediately or you will die.\" \u00a0For many patients here, Rudzinksi and his clinic are not the first choice. Anja says she attempted to order an abortion pill online from an Indian supplier, but it didn't show up. \u00a0Women march holding umbrellas, a symbol of their protest against proposed abortion restrictions, in Warsaw in October 2017. \"Lately, the Polish post hasn't been delivering them,\" she explains. \"They never arrived. By that time, it was several weeks gone. I knew I had to take another step and find a place to undergo the procedure.\" \u00a0Rudzinski was recommended to Anja through an underground network of women's rights groups, and she says she's happy to have the procedure with a doctor who can speak her language. \u00a0Anja already has an 11-month-old daughter with her husband. They plan to travel back to Poland after an overnight stay. She says she wants to have more children in the future but not right now. She also says that after this experience, she doesn't want her little girl to grow up in Poland. Her advice for Polish women seeking an abortion?\u00a0\"I say just go for it and leave this country and travel,\" she says. \"Get this procedure the way it should be done. Not underground. Do not risk your health.\"",

At Torrey Pines in January, American JB Holmes took four minutes, 10 seconds to hit his second shot on the final hole, despite the PGA Tour rules stipulating that a player should take no more than 40 seconds. His whole round took six hours.SERIOUSLY, Kevin Na?!?! That Is A Tap In, MATE! pic.twitter.com/YMmNT6m5H7\u2014 Kevin Pietersen (@KP24) February 18, 2018 \nThen there's Kevin Na, who was derided on social media -- including by former England cricketer Kevin Pietersen -- for taking a minute-and-a-half over what appeared to be a routine tap-in at the Genesis Open. Read MoreNa wasn't impressed, pointing out that the putt was actually 3 foot 4 inches and was worth $300,000. But it's not the first time Na has been cited for his pace of play, so sympathy was at a premium.  However, some in the game say there is more to slow play than the self-absorption of millionaire golfers terrified of making mistakes.\"There are times when it's unpalatable, horrible to watch,\" says Englishman Eddie Pepperell, who won his maiden European Tour title in Doha last month. \"I saw a couple of clips of Kevin Na, and that wasn't cool. And what JB Holmes did was disrespectful. But the reality is, an acceptable amount of time for a three-ball depends on the toughness and length of the course.\"READ: Tiger Woods sparks 181% TV audience boost  JUST WATCHEDJordan Spieth tees it up with Lorena OchoaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHJordan Spieth tees it up with Lorena Ochoa 03:36Horses for coursesOn top of that, he argues, the modern golfer is more analytical than in previous eras.\"I played with a teenager in a pro-am, and he was taking ages over his shots,\" says Pepperell. \"I said to my caddie, 'It's our fault that this young lad is taking this long. He's been told that it's the right thing to do.'\"But, says Pepperell, if he backed off every time he had a negative thought, he'd take six hours every round. \"We're human beings, we have negative thoughts, you've just got to get on with it,\" he says.     On the flip side, weekend warriors boasting of how quickly they play compared to the pros are not taking tournament venues into account, according to Pepperell's European Tour colleague Laurie Canter.JUST WATCHEDLee Westwood: Modern courses are too difficultReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLee Westwood: Modern courses are too difficult 01:51\"I'm not saying there aren't slow players, but it makes me laugh when I read tweets from 15-handicappers saying, 'It takes me two-and-a-half-hours to get around my local course,'\" says Canter.\"That may be, but put them on our courses, make them finish every hole, and then see how long their round would take.\"He points out that as well as layouts getting longer, the whole infrastructure around modern courses, often designed to be played in a buggy, can also have an impact. \"I played a course a couple of years ago that had four-minute walks from greens to tees on every hole. That's an extra hour of play, and it all adds up,\" he says.Englishman Eddie Pepperell won the Qatar Masters in Doha in February.Slow play or poor play?Often slow play is just a manifestation of poor play, particularly among high handicappers, and Canter is cautious of draconian measures.\"Are you going to penalize players for playing poorly?\" asks the 27-year-old. \"And it's going to happen more at majors, because of the extra challenge of major golf courses. I've played two (British) Opens, and both times it took an incredible amount of time to play my rounds.\"The argument that pro golfers are playing for vast sums of money -- or, indeed, their futures on tour -- and therefore have every right to take their time is anathema to some.But others empathize with Australia's former world No.1 Jason Day when he said he had no intention of speeding up his play, and that he's \"got to get back to what makes me good. If that means I have to back off five times, I'm going to back off five times\".Jordan Spieth took 30 minutes to play a shot during the 2017 Britih Open at Royal Birkdale, although his deliberations were to establish where he could take a drop.'Important shots'Players deemed to be slow are warned and \"put on the clock\" by officials -- if they then fail to speed up they are given a one-shot penalty.But despite the stigma attached, the PGA Tour has only penalized two players since 1995 (Miguel Angel Carballo and Brian Campbell were docked a shot at the Zurich Classic last year, although that was in a team event, in which their timings were combined). And many players have stated that nothing will change unless shots start being docked from serial offenders.But both Pepperell and Canter worry that such a system would be devilishly difficult to implement without causing controversy.\"How are you going to implement a policy that makes slow players play faster without penalizing the faster players who occasionally take longer over a shot because it's particularly challenging?\" says Canter.\"Think about one of the most iconic shots of all time, Tiger Woods' chip-in at the 16th at Augusta in 2005: it took him two-and-a-half minutes to play that shot. Imagine if a referee had come out, looking important and brandishing a yellow card in the middle of his pre-shot routine. That's not realistic.\"JB Holmes took way too long, but that might be one of his most important shots of the season.\"Tiger Woods' chip-in on the 16th in the 2005 Masters is one of golf's most iconic shots. 'Keep it flowing'Pepperell says there are some simple tweaks that would speed things up, such as being ready to play when it's your turn or hitting before it's your turn if your partner isn't ready.\"It doesn't matter who plays when, let's just keep it flowing,\" says Pepperell, who also thinks the etiquette around avoiding other players' putting lines could be looked at to reduce the length of time spent on greens.JUST WATCHEDThe CEO bringing millennials back to golfReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe CEO bringing millennials back to golf 04:02Pepperell and Canter are divided on green books -- diagrams depicting the contours on the putting surfaces; the former thinks their banning would make rounds quicker, the latter thinks it might make them longer, because certain players' minds would be even more muddled without them.And Canter thinks it is up to the players to \"take responsibility\" and police themselves, with the help of the on-course referees.\"A catalog could be built up on certain players. Maybe then slow players would say, 'My peers have a problem, so I've adjusted my routine accordingly,'\" he says.\"I'm not sure it's right slagging off players for isolated incidents. We could go through the archive and find lots of incredible shots that were well over the time limit, by lots of different players. That's part of the drama.\"The jury is out whether green books are a help or hindrance to slow play.'Society has changed'Pepperell and Canter agree that golf is never going to be anything but a slow, cerebral spectacle, but they both say it can be made into a sexier product, given funkier television coverage and with tournaments married to other forms of entertainment -- for example, the Made in Denmark event in Himmerland doubles as a music festival.JUST WATCHEDThe life of a golf trick shot artistReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe life of a golf trick shot artist 01:39But Pepperell believes that if we all just looked at the slow play debate from a different angle, \"we might just chill out a little bit.\" \"Take the Shot Clock Masters [which will be played for the first time in Austria in June],\" says Pepperell. \"If you limit players to 40 seconds per shot, what's the best that's going to happen? We get around in three-and-a-half hours? That's still a long time. \"Golf is always going to take a long time, unless you fundamentally change the way it is played, like Twenty20 cricket.\"But I wouldn't advocate that. Golf's been around for centuries, it's society that's changed. Should golf react to the changing pace of life, or does it acknowledge that we live in a state of flux, and there might come a time when people want to slow down again and get away from the stresses of life?\"I understand why golf's appeal is diminishing, because young people's attention spans are shorter -- including mine -- and people want things here and now. But will it always be that way? I hope not.\"",

One Twitter user posted \"please don't change the rules for a while,\" while a Facebook commentator described the latest tweaks as \"a terrible change.\"Follow @cnnsport\n\nBut former world champion and two-time Olympic medalist Neil Adams believes the ongoing rule changes have made judo \"the best it's ever been.\"Adams contends the International Judo Federation (IJF) has acted to prevent judo becoming too similar to traditional wrestling, particularly given the Olympic Games already has Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling events. Read MoreOver the years, slowly but surely, the rules have been altered to the betterment of the sport, according to Adams, although he accepts that it has divided judokas along stylistic lines.\"Obviously the wrestlers weren't happy but it's appealed to the traditionalists, who have embraced it,\" he tells CNN. \"Of course, you'll never get everyone agreeing 100% but these have for the most part been changes for the better.JUST WATCHEDNeil Adams: The voice of the judo worldReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNeil Adams: The voice of the judo world 02:42\"With the breakdown of the Soviet Union, there was a growth in the number of different wrestling styles coming into judo.\"The International Olympic Committee were a little bit concerned that it already had freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling, and they didn't need another one.\"The initial changes stopped that and what it effectively did was ensure the sport's Olympic future.\"Vladimir Barta, the head sport director at the International Judo Federation, admitted distancing judo from wrestling was part of the ongoing push to change the rules, although he says there were no external influences on the IJF.\"We never felt any pressure from the IOC concerning judo in the Olympic program. In fact, we have even more now - for the first time judo will have a mixed team event in the Olympic Games in 2020,\" he said.Barta also argues the thinking was to increase the intensity of a contest, encouraging scoring rather than tactics and encouraging judoka to go on the offensive.Legends of Judo: Mongolian icon Tubshinbayar NaidanTokyo targetOf the latest resultant changes for 2018 -- brought into place to ensure they are well and truly part of the sport in time for the Tokyo Olympics in two years' time -- the biggest is to Waza-ari scores.A Waza-ari is awarded when a judoka pins their opponent for more than 10 seconds but fewer than 20 seconds, or executes a successful throw without the full force or control to merit Ippon.Under the changes, there has been a reversion back to the old rule where two Waza-aris equate to Ippon, a move which ends the contest between two judoka.In recent years, players could keep on racking up Waza-aris without the contest being ended. Now, Waza-ari will also be awarded for inferior throws previously deemed worthy of Yuko -- the third highest score in judo.Of that modification, Adams says: \"I thought personally the way it was with Waza-aris was pretty exciting but a lot of coaches and fighters felt differently and so that rule is back by popular demand. The International Judo Federation can't be accused of not listening to feedback as it's reacted to that.\" Photos: Judo through the lensJudo through the lens \u2013 Born into a life of judo, International Judo Federation photographer Jack Willingham goes through his work, picking out his favorite images and explaining why he loves the sport.Hide Caption 1 of 13 Photos: Judo through the lensIlias Iliadis vs. Kiril Denisov \u2013 \"I have been a judo fan all my life,\" says Willingham. \"I was a volunteer at the Athens 2004 Olympics in the judo and watched Ilias Iliadis win Olympic gold at 17 years old (I was 16 at the time).

In the past fortnight, four current and former world No. 1s have entered her path, and four have fallen by the wayside. And if the manner in which the young Japanese star stormed to her first major title in Indian Wells last week was impressive, what stood out on Wednesday was the confidence and style with which she swept aside Serena Williams at the Miami Open.Osaka had never faced Williams before, but -- like so many players of her generation -- had grown up idolizing the American.\"I was extremely nervous coming on to the court. I don't know if anybody knows this but Serena is my favorite player,\" Osaka said after the match.\"Sometimes when I'm in a really hard position when I'm serving, I'm like 'what would Serena do?...' but I was playing her.\" The always-candid @NaomiOsaka talks about facing (and beating) her idol at @MiamiOpen! pic.twitter.com/TeRQ71tN5p\u2014 WTA (@WTA) March 22, 2018\n\nRead More\"So just playing against her is kind of like a dream for me. I'm very grateful I was able to play her and it is even better that I was able to win.\"The match lasted just 77 minutes as the 20-year-old stormed to victory over the 23-time grand slam winner in straight sets, 6-3 6-2. 'I wanted her to know who I am'For Osaka, the blueprint for victory was simple, and it was looking straight back at her from the other side of the net.\"Sometimes when I am in a really hard position when I'm serving, I'm like, `What would Serena do?'\" Osaka explained.\"It's weird if you grow up watching someone and wanting to be exactly like them and then you have the chance to play them,\" she explained. \"It's sort of this respect thing, but you also want to win really bad. I don't really know how to describe it. I just wanted her to, in the end, like after the match, just know who I am and stuff.\"It's fair to say if she didn't know before, Williams certainly knows who Osaka is now. The Japanese player has had quite the year -- a 14-4 winning record in 2018, rising 50 ranking places to 22 in the world in less than two months.Naomi Osaka celebrates her first major title, at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells on SundayAppropriately born in Osaka, Japan, the 20-year-old now resides in Florida, recently teaming up with Caroline Wozniacki's former coach, Sascha Bajin.Given the dearth of success for Japan in the women's game, Osaka has also captured the attention of the country, which has not produced a female player in the world top 10 since 2004.A tough route back to the topSerena Williams' return sparks seeding debate about pregnancyOn Serena's part, back-to-back defeats may be hard to bear -- she left the court without addressing the media -- but she was gracious in defeat, smiling and congratulating Osaka on her well-earned victory. Many commentators, including tournament director James Blake, had pointed to Serena's tough opening draw as a fault in the tennis system as the American returns from pregnancy. With no protection given to her previous No. 1 ranking, Serena's year out of the game has seen her drop to 491 in the world, leaving her unseeded and facing an arduous route back to the top. Osaka became the lowest ranked player ever to beat Serena in Miami, which perhaps says as much about the 36-year-old's consistent brilliance as it does about the shock of Osaka's victory. She now faces world No. 4 Elina Svitolina in the second round on Friday. Serena congratulates 20-year-old Naomi Osaka after their Miami Open match.Sharapova opens up on injuryEn route to her Indian Wells triumph, Osaka's first victim was Maria Sharapova, who has announced she is taking some time out of the game in order to recover from injury.Responding to a tweet from a fan who felt aggrieved about her pulling out of Russia's upcoming FED Cup tie, five-time grand slam champion Sharapova detailed the extent of her injuries, which include an air pocket in her lung, which is currently preventing her from flying.  pic.twitter.com/46B2iGtYGR\u2014 Maria Sharapova (@MariaSharapova) March 20, 2018\n\n\"I don't sign up to anything in my career unless I am fully committed to it,\" she tweeted. \"Besides numbing my left forearm 30 minutes before my first match at Indian Wells in order to get through the match without any recurring pain I have had in past months, I also found out I had an air pocket in my lung from which I wasn't allowed to fly for 3 weeks from first findings, per doctors, until it healed.\"She added: \"I will be doing everything I can to get healthy, fit and ready to compete.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Russia's ambassador to the United Kingdom hinted at British involvement in the poisoning of a former Russian double agent as he reiterated his country's stance Thursday that it had nothing to do with the attack.Relations between London and Moscow have sunk to a new low over British claims that the Kremlin was behind the poisoning on March 4 of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the English city of Salisbury. UK officials believe they were exposed to a Soviet-era nerve agent known as Novichok, which may have left them with compromised mental capacity. Speaking at the Russian embassy in London, Ambassador Alexander Yakovenko questioned how it was possible for British authorities so quickly to designate the nerve agent \"as so-called Novichok,\" when the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said it would take two to three weeks to analyze the sample.\"Could it mean that it's highly likely that the British authorities already had this nerve agent in their chemical lab in Porton Down, which is the largest secret military facility in the UK that has been dealing with chemical weapons?\" Yakovenko asked, noting that the facility lies only eight miles from Salisbury.Read MorePutin calls claims Russia poisoned ex-spy 'nonsense,' 'delirium'A British court gave permission on Thursday for blood samples to be taken from Sergei and Yulia Skripal for testing by inspectors with the OPCW to check against the analysis performed by Porton Down's research laboratory.An unidentified doctor treating the Skripals said they were both heavily sedated and unable to communicate, and that it was not possible to assess to what extent either would be able to regain mental capacity, according to the court's ruling.\"The precise effect of their exposure on their long-term health remains unclear, albeit medical tests indicate that their mental capacity might be compromised to an unknown and so far unascertained degree,\" Judge David Williams wrote.Yakovenko called on British authorities to share investigators' findings with Russia, saying repeatedly that the United Kingdom was in violation of the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations by refusing to allow Russia consular access to Sergei and Yulia Skripal after their poisoning, since both hold Russian citizenship.UK Prime Minister Theresa May visits the scene on March 15 where Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were discovered in Salisbury.Britain seeks EU condemnationAmid the worsening diplomatic dispute, UK Prime Minister Theresa May was to tell a summit of European Union leaders in Brussels later Thursday that the bloc must stand united against Russia and its threat to European democracies.\"Russia staged a brazen and reckless attack against the United Kingdom when it attempted the murder of two people on the streets of Salisbury,\" she told reporters as she arrived.\"I'll be raising this issue with my counterparts today because it's clear that the Russian threat does not respect borders and indeed the incident in Salisbury was part of a pattern of Russian aggression against Europe and its near neighbors, from the Western Balkans to the Middle East.\"May also thanked European allies for their solidarity and support. France and Germany, as well as the United States, signed a joint statement last week condemning the poisoning as \"an assault on UK sovereignty\" and saying there was \"no plausible alternative explanation\" than that Russia was responsible.Russia slams 'Hitler' comparisonResponding to reporters' questions, Yakovenko criticized remarks by UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson -- in which he drew a comparison between Russia's promotion of its hosting of the 2018 soccer World Cup and Adolf Hitler's use of the 1936 Berlin Olympics -- as \"unacceptable and totally irresponsible.\"\"Nobody has the right to insult the Russian people who defeated Nazism and lost more than 25 million people by comparing our country to Nazi Germany. That goes beyond common sense,\" Yakovenko said.UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, left, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov meet in Moscow on December 22.At the same time, he assured British soccer fans traveling to Russia for the World Cup that they would be safe despite the ongoing diplomatic row.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov earlier slammed Johnson's statement as \"completely disgusting\" and unfitting of any foreign minister. Johnson's comments were made Wednesday at a meeting of Britain's Foreign Affairs Select Committee, when he agreed with a lawmaker's suggestion that Russian President Vladimir Putin intended to use the World Cup as a \"PR exercise\" to gloss over a \"brutal, corrupt regime\" in the same way that Hitler promoted the 1936 Olympics.\"I think the comparison with 1936 is certainly right,\" Johnson said. \"I think it's an emetic prospect, frankly, to think of Putin glorying in this sporting event.\"Johnson: Timing 'connected' to Russian electionTwenty-three Russian diplomats left Britain on Tuesday after they were expelled in response to the Salisbury attack. Moscow has ordered the tit-for-tat expulsion from Russia of 23 British envoys and also closed down the British Council, a cultural institute.Meanwhile, Sergei Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter remain critically ill in the hospital. A British police officer also fell ill from exposure to the substance.Personnel in protective equipment have become a relatively common sight in Salisbury since the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal.Speaking Wednesday, Johnson said he believed the timing of the attack was \"probably more closely connected with the recent election in Russia,\" which was overwhelmingly won by Putin.JUST WATCHEDRussia accuses US of nerve agent attackReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRussia accuses US of nerve agent attack 01:53He also insisted there was no desire to \"engage in a new Cold War\" with Russia.

The UK and US declined the invitation.US State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the two nations were right not to send their ambassadors to hear \"implausible denials.\" In response, the Russian embassy in Washington said Thursday that the Americans had \"decided to put all their eggs in one British basket,\" and urged an end to the \"demonizing\" of Russia. \"It is high time to stop blaming us for every sin,\" read the embassy statement.CNN's Hande Atay Alam, Radina Gigova, Nada Bashir and Livvy Doherty contributed to this report.",

James grew up watching motorsports, so working in F1 was a dream come true. But it was short lived.In January, the sport announced it would no longer employ female promotional models on the starting grid because it did not \"resonate\" with its brand values. \"Grid girls,\" F1 bosses said, were \"at odds with modern day societal norms.\"But James tells CNN Sport: \"I absolutely loved it. You want me to wear a super comfortable outfit and go to the VIP areas and watch what I was already going to pay to watch? Yeah, that's fine by me. It was a dream job.\"Melissa James has been a promotional model for eight years.'We're not just there to stand on the concrete'Read MoreThe decision to ban \"grid girls,\" who for decades promoted brands and sponsorship deals, has divided many. But James argues there was more to the job than met the eye --  that girls weren't there just to look pretty. \"The drivers are focused on wanting to win the race, they don't want to schmooze, they don't want to have conversations -- so that's when 'grid girls' come in,\" James, from Birmingham in the United Kingdom, says.Saying that we're just a pretty face is absolutely ludicrousMelissa James, grid girl\"You're not just standing there on the concrete. You're meeting fans, you're posing with photos and, because you've got the branding on your clothes, it's going out on Instagram.\"Saying that we're just a pretty face is absolutely ludicrous.

(it) gives young girls and women the impression they're just eye candy and does nothing to encourage women in sport.\" Do you think Formula One was right to ban 'grid girls'? Have you say on our Facebook page.Critics say that role of grid girls is 'inappropriate' and 'fuel sexism in society'.The Women's Sport Trust, a charity which promotes gender equality in sports, also said last December that it was \"disappointing\" to see high profile international sporting events still choosing \"to use women to accessorize their events rather than be a central part of the sport.\" A salesperson in an outfitGrid girls are paid \"well above\" the UK minimum wage, James says.James has worked as a promotional model for eight years. As well as being a \"grid girl\" for F1 and British Touring Cars, she's also worked as a ring girl in boxing, a walk-on girl for the darts and a start-line girl for speedway. Thanks to her job, where the pay is well above the UK's minimum wage of \u00a37.50 ($10.55) an hour for over 25s, James says she has been able to buy her own property and has learned invaluable sales skills which helped her rise through the ranks to become a manager for a popular bar chain in the UK.

I feel so well-rounded and well-equipped because I've done so much promo, so I feel I can go into any industry and go straight to the top,\" she says. James admits that it is the outfits \"grid girls\" wear which appear to cause the most uproar among critics, with the catsuit -- a skintight one-piece that's normally made of lycra -- seemingly the source of much offense. Grid girls wear a variety of outfits -- but the catsuit appears to cause the most uproar among critics, James says.\"I think they just don't like that we wear catsuits -- but I'll choose it every time. It's super comfortable and I can move around in it,\" she says.No matter what outfit she wears, James says, she's still a \"saleswoman\" at the heart of it.\"Yes, I might be wearing an outfit that's very particular to that job, but you are essentially a saleswoman,\" she says. \"You don't know what you're selling until a couple of days before you have to turn up. You've got to learn the product, you've got to learn the advantages of the product and you've got to make sales for it.\" For F1, this means giving big-brand sponsors as much exposure as possible.JUST WATCHEDChristian Horner: Mercedes favorites for 2018ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHChristian Horner: Mercedes favorites for 2018 03:59Political correctness gone mad?The decision to ban F1 \"grid girls\" came just four days after the Professional Darts Corporation also announced it would no longer be using \"walk-on girls\" to accompany men onto the stage.Another \"grid girl,\" Rebecca Cooper, has also been vocal on Twitter about January's announcement, saying that recent bans are \"political correctness gone mad.\"If we don't do something to stop this where will it end?

        "content": "(CNN)French President Emmanuel Macron was facing a major test of his sweeping reform agenda with a series of strikes across the transport and public sectors on Thursday. Air-traffic controllers, train conductors and teachers walked off the job furious at the government's planned labor overhauls, causing widespread disruption for commuters and travelers. Only 40% of high-speed TGV trains and around a third of commuter trains were operating, CNN's Jim Bitterman reported from Paris' Gare Saint-Lazare railway station. Additionally, around 30% of flights from Paris airports have been canceled, mostly on short-haul routes.Civil servants are also expected to protest a string of reforms -- including planned cuts to public-sector headcount by 2022 -- on Thursday, with hospital workers and teachers joining some 140 demonstrations around the country. Thursday marks the first day of a three-month wave of industrial action by rail workers, who will strike on two out of every five days between April and June. More than 100 marches were planned across the country on Thursday. Unions are furious over plans to scrap jobs-for-life guarantees and generous retirement plans.People disembark from a Paris suburban train at the Gare de Lyon railway station on Thursday.Read MoreGovt: What people voted forWhile Thursday's strikes are likely to inconvenience many travelers, Macron was elected on a mandate of reforming the country's famously rigid labor laws. Outlining his plan last year, Macron said that his reform package would aim to give companies more hiring and firing flexibilities, more power to negotiate working conditions directly with employees and less financial risk in cases of wrongful dismissals.People hold CGT union flags as they march in protest of the French government's string of reforms on Thursday in the southern French city of Marseille.The measures would also make it easier for foreign companies to close sites in France and give new flexibility to companies with fewer than 50 employees, which make up 95% of French business.Macron's government has justified its plans by arguing that it was what people voted for last May. But in recent months, support for the French leader  has dropped in the polls. Recent surveys suggest that while a large chunk of voters support the strikes, a majority backs the reforms, Reuters reported. The French government has been trying to push through reforms for years, most notably in 1995. Then-Prime Minister Alain Juppe had proposed restructuring SNCF, the state railroad system, and higher retirement ages for drivers. But he was forced to concede after the country's powerful unions adopted a hard-line stance, sending thousands to the streets in demonstrations that paralyzed the nation. JUST WATCHEDWhy are the French always striking?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhy are the French always striking? 01:37\"What we need to avoid is that all the grievances fuse together, as was the case in 1995,\" Reuters quoted a government official as saying.\"The situation is very different from 1995. At the time there was a big discrepancy with what the government had promised during the elections and what they eventually did.\"French business leaders and economists have welcomed the reform plans. France's economic outlook for the year has been positive, with experts suggesting that while the protests are Macron's biggest challenge thus far, he is in a much stronger position than his predecessors and unlikely to back down. The planned strikes are currently not part of a unified union opposition, unlike in the past. The risk will come in the longer term if unions are able to persuade their members to stay home for longer, which could lead to wider economic repercussions.   Many will be watching turnout on Thursday to see what might be in store for the country over the coming months. \"Either they (the government) listen to us and it will have been just a warning shot, or they don't listen to us and then, let me tell you that public-sector workers are very mobilized,\" Laurent Berger, the head of France's largest union, the CFDT, told RTL radio, according to Reuters.CNN's Melissa Bell contributed to this report.",

We aim to keep them in the car.\"If things don't go to plan, Horner says the team will look to Red Bull's junior program for new talent, or to Spaniard Carlos Sainz, who is currently on loan to Renault but still under contract with Red Bull. Ricciardo capitalized on a chaotic Azerbaijan GP last year -- that saw championship leaders Vettel and Hamilton collide -- for his sole victory of the season.He is eight years the senior of teammate Verstappen and on the track has been the more consistent performer, recording nine podiums to the Dutchman's four in 2017. The pair, however, seem to work well together, with Ricciardo recently admitting that Verstappen is the first teammate he's had who can challenge him.

Its beaches are a magnet for tourists, but the area is also a key agricultural center. Italy's processed tomatoes are sold around the world, and about a third of them are produced here, in the province of Foggia.  But far from its tourist-packed beaches, the region is scattered with makeshift camps, known locally as ghettos, that are home to a migrant workforce that plants and harvests its crops.Read More Italy's biggest labor union, CGIL, estimates that up to 12,000 migrants live in these camps in abject conditions. In some of these places, migrants say, the lack of basic services such as running water, electricity or waste disposal can have fatal consequences. Italian media reports that four migrants have died in such camps just in the last year: one of hypothermia, three in fires.More from the CNN Freedom Project These makeshift communities are home to both legal and undocumented migrants from all over the world. They include EU citizens, often from Romania and Bulgaria, Afghans and Pakistanis, but most residents are young men from Africa. They come here to find work as day laborers.

These gangmasters take a share of the workers' wages and often charge them for transport to the fields, as well as the food and water they receive while there. Raffaele Falcone is a legal expert who works for CGIL, Italy's biggest labor union. He gives an example of how it works: \"One big landowner in this area uses a gangmaster from Morocco, who has 10 vans and employs drivers from the ghetto. The sex trafficking trail from Nigeria to Europe\"For each 300-kilo box of tomatoes filled by the workers, the landowner gives \u20ac5 ($5.80) to an Italian middle-man who deals with the gangmaster. After they both take their cut, the worker gets \u20ac3 ($2.5). Migrants are charged \u20ac5 for transport. Sometimes five more for food.\" The legal minimum wage for laborers in this province is \u20ac53 ($62) per day. Working hours are limited to six-and-a-half hours a day, with a maximum of three hours overtime per day. For months, Falcone and his colleagues have been visiting the camps to convince migrants to report the abuse they suffer.Read more: Slave auctions in Libya He says that since September he has logged 34 detailed stories of exploitation, where migrants were found to work under a gangmaster, with no employment contract, and for more than 10 hours a day. Some cases involved violence -- one reason why most workers are too afraid to speak out, according to Falcone. Because they live in camps where law enforcement is virtually absent, he says, migrants are exposed to the retaliations of the gangmasters, who have the power to starve them for work and harm them physically.The Runway Ghetto is located at the site of a former military airport.Life in the 'Runway Ghetto' Aly Muhammad, 19, left Mali when he was 16. Now he lives in a camp of migrant workers that has grown up next to Borgo Mezzanone, a rural hamlet of 500 residents. Here, a decommissioned military airport has grown into a makeshift community made of containers, tents and shacks, known as the \"Runway Ghetto.\"  Different sections of the runway host different communities, with their own churches, mosques, corner shops, butchers and even nightclubs.Read more: Cleaning up America's 'ground-zero' for modern slavery Muhammad says that during the year he spent in Libya on his way to Italy, he was imprisoned and tortured by militias in Tripoli until his family sent him the equivalent of $600 to pay for his release. But nothing angers him more than the treatment he received in Italy. \"How can a first world country keep people living like this?\" he says.Pastor Charles, at the Nigerian church in the Runway Ghetto. Muhammad no longer toils in the fields, now working as a mechanic in his camp. Because he doesn't answer to farmland bosses, he says he is not afraid to speak of the abuse he witnessed during the short time he spent in agriculture. \"I have seen my brothers breaking their backs under the sun for 12 hours, and then being denied their wage,\" he says. \"If they complained, the Italian landowner would beat them up.\" CNN contacted the Interior Minister's special delegate assigned to deal with public order and health issues arising from the presence of the illegal camps. The office, after initially agreeing to an interview, said the special delegate was no longer available to discuss the issue of camp conditions. Breaking the system The governor of Puglia, Michele Emiliano, called upon businesses to break the gangmaster system by only employing migrants legally.JUST WATCHEDTrafficked for sex in ItalyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTrafficked for sex in Italy 02:50 Emiliano told CNN that farmers using gangmasters can have their land seized, the result of a tough anti-exploitation law passed in 2016, in the wake of the death of Italian grape-picker Paola Clemente. She was working in the fields of Puglia earning \u20ac2 an hour ($2.4) when she died of a heart attack, aged 49. The judicial investigation into her case found that her recruiters took advantage of her vulnerable economic conditions to extort her wage and impose extreme working conditions. The new law means that those found to be hiring workers through gangmasters who exploit laborers can face up to eight years in prison. And the law offers victims of labor exploitation the same protection and resources available to victims of sex trafficking, such as access to professional training opportunities.Trash litters the fields around the Runway Ghetto. In July, in a landmark anti-slavery case in Lecce, at the southern end of Puglia, public prosecutors obtained heavy jail sentences for eight gangmasters and three landowners. Court documents from the case, seen by CNN, reveal a scheme where landowners trafficked migrants directly from Tunisia to secure cheap labor. Every few weeks, gangmasters rotated the workers around camps and employers in other Italian provinces, including Foggia, hundreds of miles away from each other, in order to keep them vulnerable. Judicial initiatives on a comparable scale haven't been seen in Foggia. But some landowners here feel that the new anti-exploitation legislation targets them unfairly. They say they require a flexible workforce, and because they don't speak the language or understand the culture of their migrant laborers, the best way of hiring them is through middlemen. \"Now we are treated as gangmasters\" protests Enzo Smacchia, who owns 40 hectares of cultivated fields in Puglia and says he pays his workers a fair wage. \"Why don't the authorities focus on all the crime and prostitution that goes on in the ghettos?\" he says.Farmer Enzo Smacchia says he pays his workers a fair wage. Smacchia feels that medium-sized landowners like himself are victims of the retail sector, which he says has driven down prices for tomatoes, leaving migrant workers vulnerable to exploitation. The public prosecutor for Foggia, Francesca Pirrelli, said: \"Labor exploitation originates in the absence of job centers and in the great poverty of this province, which is driven by the prices made by the retail sector.\" Pirrelli now heads a newly established task force dedicated to fighting the gangmaster system. She says there will be a major a crackdown next spring, when the harvest begins. \"The law now allows us to seize land, which is the most effective deterrent against this sort of crime,\" she said. Emiliano says that Italy's Interior Minister made a personal commitment to provide witness protection to both companies and workers who come forward to report abuse.Camp evictionsThe regional government says it is taking a tough stance on the migrant camps. Emiliano describes these places as being \"controlled by criminal organizations dedicated to prostitution, drug dealing and caporali.\"Burning trash at the Runway Ghetto. Residents have been evicted from some camps and Emiliano says more evictions are imminent. He says that evicted migrants can move to structures provided by the regional government, with free access to food and sanitation facilities, where they will be free from the exploitation of gangmasters. Only 1,000 beds are currently available at these regional reception centers, but the administration is planning to build more by the next harvesting season. As winter approaches, fewer laborers are needed in the fields; some migrate further south, to harvest oranges; some go to the industrial cities of the north. Inside the camps, the thousands who stay become more dependent on the illegal economy. Improvised heating systems increase the risk of fires, but the cold is a more imminent threat. On December 16, a group of migrants from the ghettos will march in Rome to demand an end to labor exploitation, and to voice their right to safe and decent housing. They believe that until workers organize, things won't really change. One of their slogans is: \"You wanted manpower, you found men.\"Milena Veselinovic and Isa Soares contributed to this report.",

That is, until now. Everything changed at the 2018 Games in Pyeongchang as the South Korean women's curling team blazed a trail to the Olympic final and that historic silver medal.PyeongChang 2018: The top 11 moments from the Winter OlympicsHopes were high for Korean fans ahead of PyeongChang, but they were looking to the speed-skaters to deliver the medals. Curling was barely on the radar --- only 800 people curl in South Korea, a country with just five centers dedicated to the sport.But some people were rooting for them, people whose lives had already been changed by the \"Garlic Girls.\"Kim Yeong-mi's father had died when she and her sister were young. She told CNN Sport her natural inclination was to help people like herself, because she \"didn't grow up in a wealthy family.\"Her ambition to become a kindergarten teacher never came into fruition, but as the team partnered up with the NGO World Vision, Kim found another way to realize her dream: providing assistance to children in need by sponsoring children in South Korea and as far afield as Vietnam and Bosnia.The Garlic Girls driving for gold against Sweden in the Winter Olympic gold medal match.Since 2011 the \"Garlic Girls\" have been helping a young Bosnian boy named Aliosa, and he has not forgotten their kindness. On the eve of the Games he sent through a video message of support, cheering them on from across the globe.The team had been using their prize money to assist Aliosa with his education and Kim Yeong-mi was thrilled to hear from him: \"We are all very happy that he's made it to a higher-level school with the small amount of money we sent him.\"And if there's such a thing as karma, Team Kim was about to experience it.Reaching K-pop star status\"Prior to the Olympics, we never imagined this would happen to us. Not many people knew about curling, but so many people supported us,\" Kim explained.Even weeks later, she remains giddy at the memory of their Olympic experience. By beating the defending champions Canada in the group stage, the girls had won everyone's attention; by making the final, they had made history --- the first ever appearance by an Asian team in the gold medal match.That they ultimately fell short against Sweden hardly seemed to matter -- five humble, unassuming young women had suddenly been elevated to the revered cultural status of K-pop stars.In the weeks since the Olympics, they have found themselves being stopped on the street and sent extra food when dining in restaurants.The Garlic Girls celebrate an historic silver medal on the Winter Olympic podium in Pyeongchang.Though delighted with their success on a personal level, the \"Garlic Girls\" had been oblivious to the scope of excitement sparked by their silver medal run throughout South Korea, having surrendered their phones for the duration of the competition.\"When we got our phones back, we were getting so many notifications on our social media feeds that we had to turn them off,\" Kim explained.Both she and her teammates could easily have been changed by the experience, but they remain incredibly down to earth.Staying groundedTeam Kim's success is clearly marketable, but they have not used their newfound success to cash in at the earliest opportunity, as many might have done.Their coach explained that with a wave of lucrative commercial endorsement offers flooding in, the \"Garlic Girls\" have been cautious and considered in their decisions.What inspires Pyeongchang's Winter Olympians?By promoting Uiseong garlic ham, they're not forgetting their roots \u2014 quite literally; while the decision to sign a deal with electronics company LG is based on the firm's well-documented corporate social responsibility.South Korea's President Moon Jae-in has had a fair amount to deal with over the last couple of months on the world stage, to say the least, but he took time to write to the \"Garlic Girls\" personally.In his letter, he remarked specifically on the team's generous spirit, and it's hard to disagree with him.On the money gained from their Olympic success, Kim Yeong-mi talks in simple terms: \"Although it may be a small amount of money for us, there are so many things children can do with the same amount, such as, to go to school or eat a decent meal. We want to give them hope.\"",

Now McLaren has unveiled a fresh, track-only version -- the Senna GTR.Its McLaren's fastest ever non-F1 car and it will cost $1.4 million. The price tag may be hefty but it buys exclusivity. A maximum of just 75 cars will go into production. For McLaren CEO Mike Flewitt the car's attraction lies in its affinity with the racing circuit. Read More\"The very limited number of customers who secure this car will be buying the closest experience you can get to a race car without actually lining up on a circuit grid,\" Flewitt said in a press release.It's an appropriate aim for a car bearing the name of one of motorsport's greatest drivers.

Senna's career and legacy are central to the identity of the McLaren team and the naming dedication on these two cars is tribute to the man's importance to F1 history. McLaren Vehicle Line Director Andy Palmer told CNN Sport: \"Senna was renowned for his exceptional powers of concentration and single-minded focus on being the best on the track. \"Ayrton was completely hardwired into the dynamic experience and renowned for meticulously analyzing his laps and being able to feel even the smallest change made to his racing car.\"He would also look at every single detail to make the car go faster -- this spirit still lives on at McLaren and is embodied by the car bearing his name.\"JUST WATCHEDThe Circuit's 2018 Formula One season previewReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe Circuit's 2018 Formula One season preview 23:01READ: F1 in 2018 -- faster tires, fewer engines ... and a haloAttached to that aim is the company's dedication to working together with the Senna Foundation, founded in 1994 by Ayrton's sister Viviane.The foundation has pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into the education of Brazilian children. Bruno Senna -- son of Vivianne and nephew of Ayrton -- is a McLaren brand ambassador, racing for the team in the FIA World Endurance Championships, and also contributed to the development of the Senna GTR.

Parry-Williams explained: \"The McLaren Senna was designed from the outset with the full spectrum of road and track requirements in mind, so developing a GTR version is within the scope of the original project.\" The McLaren Senna GTR will have a larger front splitter than the standard modelThe new design is entirely focused on maximizing the aerodynamics of the car, with a larger front splitter than its road-car equivalent and the outer skin of the doors squeezed tight into the center of the car to direct airflow and increase speed.In terms of speed, the GTR will fall in line with McLaren's attempt to bring the track-based experience to its customers, posting its fasted circuit lap times outside of F1, thanks to an increased horsepower of 825PS.

A British police officer also fell ill from exposure to the substance, which British officials believe was the military-grade nerve agent Novichok.\"Of course it is a bit upsetting that this happened, that politics has reached such silliness,\" one staff member said before boarding the plane. \"But we are leaving this country with light hearts as we are returning home.\"Putin calls row 'delirium'UK Prime Minister Theresa May has accused Russia of orchestrating the attack, and Russian officials have repeatedly denied carrying out the poisoning. Russian President Vladimir Putin described the accusations as \"delirium\" on Sunday, in comments after winning another six years as president.Experts from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons have arrived in the UK to investigate the use of the substance, on May's invitation.

Even the added spice of veteran nine-time world champion Rossi, 39,  tracking the pair closely, fresh from inking a new two-year contract, was not enough to distract from an enthralling duel.\"Towards the end, after passing Zarco, I tried to pull out a gap on Marquez and Rossi but I didn't have any more grip and was unable to increase my lead,\" Dovizioso told reporters after the race.Andreas Dovizioso (center) celebrates alongside Marc Marquez (left) and Valentino Rossi.\"At the last curve I had to be very careful because I knew that Marquez would try and pass me, and that's how it went.\"He closed the door on me even more than [last season] in Austria and Japan, but I passed him on the inside of the curb and then took advantage of the power of my Desmosedici to stay ahead.\"Marc Marquez: Will MotoGP's Catalan king wear the crown in Spain?Marquez said: \"What a race. I'm really happy with our second-place finish because this is one of the tracks on the calendar where we struggle most. \"I tried to pass Dovi in the last corner but he beat me.

        "content": "Moscow (CNN)With almost all of the votes counted in Russia's presidential election, the state-run Russia Public Opinion Research Center published an exit poll that showed Vladimir Putin with 76.6% of the vote.While final results had yet to be released as Russians gathered in Moscow's Manezhnaya Square for a Putin rally, it was clear that the Russian President was well ahead of the 63.6% he secured in the last election in 2012 -- and on track to reach a widely reported goal of winning 70% of the votes cast.That means several things: Putin can claim a clear mandate for his next six years in office. And the Kremlin can argue that Russia's system of managed democracy represents the genuine will of the people.Russia's Vladimir Putin retains grip on power, exit poll showsThat's particularly key as Moscow escalates a confrontation with the West. Russia and the United Kingdom are in involved in a diplomatic feud over the poisoning of a Russian ex-spy, his daughter and a police officer in Britain earlier this month. And the Kremlin remains at odds with Washington after the United States hit Russia with new sanctions over its meddling in the 2016 presidential election.Several factors explain the Kremlin's ability to get out the vote.Read MoreFor weeks in advance of the election, the government funded an intense messaging campaign meant to get Russians to the ballot box. Mobile-phone subscribers received SMS notifications reminding them to vote. Billboards and public-service announcements also reminded eligible voters to go to the polls.And on election day, it was clear that there were efforts to encourage turnout, although it was unclear if they were officially supported. At a polling station in central Moscow near the House of Government, the workplace of the Russian Prime Minister, employees of a construction firm told CNN that the company's management provided transportation to the polls early Sunday.Putin addresses the crowd during a rally and concert in Moscow on Sunday night. International election monitors had not weighed in on the vote Sunday evening. Ella Pamfilova, Russia's top election official, told the respected business news outlet RBC that there had been a \"relatively small\" number of reported violations during the vote.But local election officials said they had confirmed an incident of ballot box stuffing in the Moscow suburb of Lyubertsy after studying video camera recordings, the state news agency TASS reported. And Golos, an independent watchdog group, said Sunday evening it has received over 2,700 reports of potential voting irregularities in Russia's presidential election.As of late Sunday, it was unclear whether the Kremlin had achieved the magic \"70/70\" formula: A 70% voter turnout, with Putin winning 70% of the votes.Opposition leader Alexey Navalny, who had called for a boycott, declared a victory of sorts, saying: \"If it had not been for our [independent] observers, there would have been 99% turnout. If it had not been for our observers , the turnout for Putin would have been 80%, and that would have given an opportunity to state that the 'whole Russia stands for Putin.'\"Will Vladimir Putin ever release his grip on Russia?\"One should not think that the people are more silly than they are. Putin stated that our country is a democratic one, that our courts are fair, but he is lying. Sobchak is lying as well, that is why the people do not vote for her,\" he said, referring to Ksenia Sobchak, who was projected to win 2.5% of the vote.  \"One should honestly tell the people about poverty, the big gap in the income of the people,\" added Navalny.But 70 is also a number that may hang over Putin's next six years.Back in 2016, the respected business newspaper Vedomosti published a striking revelation: Between 2005 and 2015, the private sector's share of the economy was cut in half In Russia. The report, based on a study by Russia's Federal Anti-Monopoly Service, found that the government and state-controlled companies accounted for 70% of economic activity.For some observers, the real question for Putin is whether he can now use his mandate to push for some program of economic reform.Writing last year, Carnegie Moscow Center Senior Fellow Andrei Movchan speculated that the government would not loosen its grip on the economy after the elections.  \"Judging by the current state of public opinion, future changes are likely to include stricter political control, further nationalization of private property, further shutting down the economic space, and new processes that make economic transactions in the country less sophisticated and more inefficient,\" he said.",

        "content": "London (CNN)The UK has reached a joint legal agreement with the European Union on the legal terms of a Brexit transition deal, a milestone development in the tortured negotiations to extricate Britain from the bloc.Under the terms, the UK will be able to negotiate trade deals with other countries during the 21-month transition, which begins when Britain officially leaves the EU at the end of March 2019.But in order to secure the deal -- which gives a degree of certainty for businesses -- the UK was forced to make concessions, including on the rights of EU citizens who arrive during the transition period. London also had to accept a \"backstop\" deal to avoid a \"hard\" Irish border that would keep Northern Ireland subject to EU law.Speaking at a news conference in Brussels on Monday, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said agreement on the draft legal text for withdrawal was a \"decisive step\" towards Brexit.Brexit is a mess because of giant political egosHe said the text, to be presented to EU heads of government on Friday, will be \"the international agreement for an ordered withdrawal of the UK from the EU.\"Read MoreThe announcement came after \"intense\" negotiations between technical and legal experts from both sides over the past few days, Barnier said.Speaking alongside the UK's Brexit Secretary David Davis, Barnier said: \"What we are presenting today is a joint legal text, which to my mind constitutes a decisive step.\"Davis added that \"a good deal for the UK and the European Union is closer than ever before.\"Trade dealsThe provisional accord, which is not yet set in stone, includes the terms for a 21-month transition period after Brexit, which is scheduled to happen on March 29, 2019, to allow business to adjust. In what could be seen as a big win for the UK, the draft agreement confirms that the UK may sign trade deals with other nations, as long as they don't come into force until the end of the transition period.Sterling jumped against the euro on the news as the markets cheered the announcement. European Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, right, and British Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union David Davis.Irish sticking pointOne sticking point that could unravel the agreement is the issue of the border between the Republic of Ireland, which is, and will remain a part of the EU and Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK. \"We must have a workable and practical solution to avoid a hard border and protect north south cooperation,\" Barnier said. Barnier said the UK has agreed in principle to the EU's \"backstop\" plan for the status of the Irish border, under which Northern Ireland would remain part of the EU's customs union if there is no better idea to maintain the seamless flow of goods and people across the border.The EU is concerned a  \"hard border\" between Ireland and Northern Ireland, believing it could jeopardize the 1998 peace accord that ended decades of sectarian violence in the UK province.\"We agreed today that the backstop solution must form part of the legal text of the withdrawal agreement,\" Barnier said.The remaining 27 EU countries insist that the must agree to terms on Northern Ireland before it will sign off on the final version of the divorce agreement and move on to future trade agreements between the UK and the EU, its largest trading partner. Barnier will this week discuss the agreement with EU foreign ministers, the European Commission and on Friday, EU heads of government, apart from UK Prime MInister Theresa May who is not invited.",

A stunning eight-under-par 64 ensured McIlroy finished three strokes clear of Bryson DeChambeau, with Woods ending the weekend 10 under in a tie for fifth.It was some reversal in fortunes for McIlroy, who missed the cut at last week's Valspar Championship.\"You're never far away from producing golf like what I did today,\" the four-time major winner told the PGA Tour's official website.Read More\"But on the flip side, I don't think you're ever far away from producing mediocre golf as well.\"READ: Woods sparks 181% audience boostThe Northern Irishman needs a green jacket at Augusta to complete a career grand slam of golf's four majors.

At the other end of the spectrum, six players boast more than 50 caps. Follow @cnnsport\n\n\"Youthful enthusiasm is being tempered by the experienced guys that certainly have been there before,\" said Schmidt. \"That blend is working quite well for us at the moment.\"Ireland's players were crowned champions in the swirling London snow, claiming their country's third ever Grand Slam and first since 2009, in the process condemning England to its worst finish in the competition in 35 years. Of the emerging stars of this Ireland team, Schmidt singled out winger Jacob Stockdale, who, with seven tries in this year's tournament, set a Six Nations record.

As long as they keep that mentality, the guys that are slightly older, if they keep that want to keep going forward that's all you can ask. \"We'll always want more because we're competitive and maybe a little bit greedy.\"Schmidt jokes that Best, at the age of 35 and with 111 caps to his name, is \"getting faster and faster on that Zimmer frame.\"\"We'll see how we go with that,\" he responds, when asked if the Ulsterman could lead Ireland into next year's World Cup.

        "content": "(CNN)Sunday's landslide election that handed victory to Russian President Vladimir Putin was \"overly controlled\" and \"lacked genuine competition,\" international election monitors said Monday.The number 70 could haunt Putin's next six yearsMichael Georg Link, who led a team of observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), said election day was conducted professionally and in an orderly manner, but that the vote was held on \"an uneven playing field.\"He pointed to the extensive media coverage given to Putin on tightly controlled state-run television, the main source of political information in Russia.\"Where the legal framework restricts many fundamental freedoms and the outcome is not in doubt, elections almost lose their purpose,\" Link  said Monday at a news conference in Moscow.  \"Most candidates publicly expressed their certainty that the incumbent President would prevail in the election.\"Read MorePeople wait for election results in Manezhnaya Square, near the Kremlin in Moscow on Sunday.Link said that although a significant number of people turned out to vote, restrictions on their fundamental freedoms \"have limited the space for political engagement and resulted in a lack of genuine political competition.\"\"A choice without a real competition, as we have seen in this election, unfortunately is not a real choice,\" he said.With nearly all the votes now counted, Putin has won 76.7% of the vote, giving him the mandate to rule Russia until 2024. The Communist Party's Pavel Grudinin came in at a distant second with 11.8%.     Putin's critics have slammed the election as unfair, citing the Kremlin's tight control over the media, quelling of the opposition and restrictions on some election monitors to ensure a free vote.His most vocal political opponent, Alexei Navalny, was barred from running in the election because of an embezzlement conviction that he says was designed to keep him off the ballot. Navalny had called for a boycott of what he described as a sham vote. The Central Election Commission said 67.98% of eligible voters cast a ballot.\"A great many people in this country are willing to stand against the authorities. They need a proper opposition,\" Navalny said Sunday.The independent Golos Association, an election watchdog, said Monday that there had been irregularities with the presidential vote \"not only on voting days but throughout the campaign.\"Golos reported more than 2,900 voting irregularities on Monday.\"Unfortunately, we have to note that not all candidates behaved honestly in line with international standards,\" said a Golos spokesman, without naming specific candidates. The elections \"were to some extent unfair and undemocratic,\" he said. Controversial voting in CrimeaWestern diplomats also criticized Russia for holding the vote on the Crimean peninsula, a bold decision by Putin, whose current term has been characterized by provocations against Western powers. Moscow chose to hold the election four years to the date of when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine, a day now celebrated in Russia as one of \"reunification.\"Norway's foreign ministry refused to recognize the vote in Crimea.\"Norway will continue to support the EU's non-recognition policy. #CrimeaIsUkraine,\" it wrote on its official Twitter account.The Dutch foreign ministry showed similar support on Twitter: \"NL remains committed to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. #CrimeaIsUkraine.\"Cadets of the Nakhimov naval academy vote at in Sevastopol, Crimea, on Sunday.While congratulating Putin, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier warned the President that his country's actions could worsen relations.\"Mistrust, armament and a climate of insecurity contribute to instability. I hope and wish that we will be able to counteract the estrangement on our continent, and between the people of Russia and Germany, and that you will use your new term of office for this purpose.\"Putin: UK spy row 'delirium'In a meeting with the losing candidates, Putin said Monday that Russia would strengthen its defense posture, but emphasized the country would not start another arms race.Before the election Putin boasted about \"invincible\" nuclear-capable missiles with an incendiary video showing a Russian missile striking a map of what appeared to be Florida. Putin calls claims Russia poisoned ex-spy 'nonsense,' 'delirium'The election also comes amid a diplomatic crisis between Russia and the UK over the poisoning of a Russian former spy, his daughter and a UK policeman on British soil. UK Prime Minister Theresa May has openly blamed Russia for the incident. Putin described the accusations Sunday as \"delirium,\" and both countries have expelled respective diplomats over the row.Relations with the United States took another hit after Washington on Thursday announced new sanctions on Russia over its reported meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. Russia has vowed retaliation.Despite criticisms of the Kremlin's actions ahead of the election, Putin is a genuinely popular figure in Russia, and confrontation with the West has boosted his approval ratings, past polling shows.",

Adi\u00f3s, Cesar \ud83d\udc96 A post shared by  Juan Martin del Potro (@delpotrojuan) on Feb 17, 2018 at 5:51am PST Del Potro has struggled with injury since beating Federer in the 2009 US Open final to win his first grand slam, missing almost the entire 2010 season after undergoing surgery on his wrist.After slipping outside the world's top 400, Del Potro returned to the top five in 2013 but another wrist injury meant more surgery and led him to miss the majority of the 2014 and 2015 season.\"I cannot  believe this moment,\" he said of his BNP Paribas Open victory. \"I always think about what I did in the past, trying to fix my wrist problems. \"I did, I'm playing tennis again and winning titles so I have a lot of things to celebrate and this trophy is one of them.\"When asked what he expected of himself for the remainder of 2018, he said: \"I don't know, I'm just going my way and I'm very pleased with my level of tennis. \"I'm excited to keep surprising myself, the tour and seeing what I can do.\"READ: Rafael Nadal 'living with pain and painkillers since 2005'READ: Will Roger Federer play French Open?Frustrated FedererIt was the Argentine's trademark booming forehand which helped him gain control in a tight first set, eventually winning 6-4 in 34 minutes.The second set was even tighter and at times sprinkled with the kind of quality that graced matches between the pair a decade ago.The perfect post-match shower: Flower petals \ud83c\udf3a\ud83c\udf39\ud83c\udf3c #BNPPO18 #FullBloom pic.twitter.com/htSGMYnBfn\u2014 BNP Paribas Open (@BNPPARIBASOPEN) March 18, 2018\n\nA Federer drop shot, expertly chased down by Del Potro, was followed by a lob and then a hotdog from the Argentine, before two more volleys from the 36-year-old brought an end to a sublime point and brought the crowd to its feet. With nothing to separate the two after 12 games, the set went to a tiebreak and Federer celebrated victory at 7-5 as Del Potro's return of serve sailed long.His celebrations, however, were short lived. A challenge from Del Potro showed the Swiss' serve had landed out, prompting a frustrated Federer to vent at the chair umpire after his wild second serve landed more than a foot long.It was then Del Potro's turn to rue a missed opportunity, dumping his usually reliable forehand into the net as he went for the winner on match point.And Federer made him pay for his error, winning the two following points to take the match to a third and deciding set.Soak it in, Delpo #BNPPO18 \ud83c\udfa5 @TennisTV pic.twitter.com/XdpZy2FZqj\u2014 BNP Paribas Open (@BNPPARIBASOPEN) March 18, 2018\n\nWith Federer 40-15 up on serve and leading 5-4 having broken Del Potro in the previous game, it was again the Argentine's huge forehand which began dictating the points, leveling the score at deuce.He saved a third match point, softly stroking a passing shot down the line, before a crushing forehand winner had the usually elegant Federer scrambling desperately across his baseline.Del Potro went on to dominate the deciding tiebreak, winning 7-2 to claim his maiden Masters 1000 title.Federer was frustrated to throw away three match points on serve, though he will have to lick his wounds and move on quickly with another Masters 1000 event in Miami starting Wednesday.Federer is the defending champion there, too.\"It's a bit disappointing but that's how it goes,\" Federer says in press. \"But well done to him.

Not every day is sun shining.\"I feel frustrated, you know, that I let an opportunity like this go by. \"Serving 40-15, any game I probably win -- I don't know what the stat is -- 90-something per cent.\"So it should sting, like you said, for a bit. The question is how long? It won't be long, but it's disappointing talking about a great match like this, losing, even though I was right there.\"Obviously there is not too much time to dwell over it. Like I said, I'm happy for Juan Martin. It's a tough one. And I still had a good week here. I still see the positives at the end of the day.\"",

Follow @cnnsport\n\nIt was the 33-year-old's 50th career hat-trick, and the eighth time he has bagged four or more in a Real Madrid shirt.Having languished on four La Liga goals before the turn of the year, Ronaldo has scored 18 in nine league games since, taking him to second in the overall standings behind his Argentine rival. Read MoreNo player from Europe's top five leagues has scored more in 2018.  \"Cristiano's a very important player for us; he transmits an important and positive energy to the group,\" said Zidane. \"He's unbelievably ambitious and that comes across in every training session and in everything he does on the pitch. It's what makes him different from the rest.\"Having surpassed Luis Suarez, Ronaldo is now just three behind Messi as his quest for a fourth Pichichi Trophy intensifies. \"Hopefully he can catch him. It's important for him and for us too,\" said Zidane. \"When he's playing well, the team plays well\".\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9 pic.twitter.com/oHP8O1YqTr\u2014 B/R Football (@brfootball) March 18, 2018\n\nSuch were Ronaldo's woes in front of goal in the first half of the season, it was taking him on average 23 shots to find the back of the net. Now, Spanish media report, he is requiring less than four. \"He's always in very good form come the end of the season,\" said Zidane. \"He's got an eye for goal and he'll never lose that.\"All four of the striker's goals were first-touch finishes from within the area. With Ronaldo firing, Real have won eight of their past 10 La Liga fixtures, taking them within four points of Atletico Madrid in second place. 36 - Barcelona are unbeaten in 36 league games in a row (W30 D6), the best current run of any side in the top five European leagues.

We're going to try to continue in this vein\".'The eighth wonder of the world'Ronaldo was not the only player to hit the headlines with four goals in a single game across Europe's top five leagues this weekend. Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah took his tally to 36 in just 41 appearances, putting Watford to the sword in a 5-0 home victory -- the sixth time Klopp's men have scored five or more this season.Mo Salah is the first Egyptian to score four or more in Europe's top five leagues in the 21st century. The 25-year-old is now the outright top scorer in Europe's top five leagues, leaving Reds players past and present at a loss for new superlatives. \"I think it's indescribable. The goals he brings are invaluable and he's just so good to play with,\" said defender Joe Gomez. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb pic.twitter.com/HS2rGw831a\u2014 Alex (@Cheapshirt) March 17, 2018  \"Scoring goals has always been regarded as the hardest part of the game,\" said former striker Michael Owen, who twice netted four for Liverpool. \"Mo Salah is starting to make me question that statement.\" Owen didn't even manage to hit 20 league goals in a single campaign over the course of his eight-year career at Anfield. Salah already has 28 with seven fixtures remaining -- four more than Tottenham's Harry Kane who was recently sidelined with an ankle injury.The Egyptian is only the third Liverpool player to score 25 or more in a single campaign, emulating club greats Robbie Fowler and Luis Suarez.He has also now scored more goals in all competitions than any other Liverpool player in their debut season at the club, overtaking the mark set in 2007/08 by Fernando Torres. \"Mo's just a positive person and a great guy to be around, he's always smiley and happy,\" said Gomez, after Salah sportingly apologized to Watford goalkeeper Orestis Karnezis.\"That shows on the pitch, he just enjoys his football. It's a pleasure to be around and a breath of fresh air.\"Mo Salah APOLOGISED to the Watford keeper after sticking four past him. The nicest guy in football \ud83d\udc4f pic.twitter.com/YaHAjGgTEi\u2014 Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) March 17, 2018\n\nBrazilian Roberto Firmino was the other scorer on a snowy Anfield night, deftly flicking home a cross by Salah for his 23rd of the campaign. That duo and fellow forward Sadio Mane have now found the back of the net 73 times between them this season. \"The whole team has got so much quality and depth,\" said Gomez.  \"It's a great side.\"Salah is the first to score four goals from exactly four shots in England's top-flight Arsenal's since Andrey Arshavin against Liverpool at the same ground in April 2009.CenturionA thousand miles away at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris, Inter Milan captain Mauro Icardi reached a milestone of his own in the Nerazzuri's 5-0 victory over Sampdoria. Without a goal for two-and-a-half months, Icardi found the net four times in just 21 minutes against his former club -- the second an impudent backheel that left Sampdoria goalkeeper Emiliano Viviano embarrassed. Mauro Icardi celebrates his four-goal haul. The last Inter player to score four in a single game was Diego MIlito in 2012 against Palermo. It took the 25-year-old to 100 career goals in Serie A -- making him the sixth youngest to achieve the feat.Only AC Milan great Jose Altafini, Juventus legends Felice Borel and Giampiero Boniperti, Lazio stalwart Silvio Piola and Giuseppe Meazza have reached the mark quicker.\u26bd\ufe0f 30' \u26bd\ufe0f 31'\u26bd\ufe0f 44'\u26bd\ufe0f 51'Mauro Icardi making movements \ud83d\udd25What.

I also went through a difficult time with my injury; I had something bothering me and I couldn't play without having it on my mind. \"Now, it's just an unpleasant memory, I'm back available and I want to help the team.\"Who will finish as top scorer in Europe's top five leagues? Have your say on CNN Sport's Facebook pageWith 22 Serie A goals for the season, Icardi is now just two behind Lazio's Ciro Immobile in the race for the the Italian league's Capocannoniere -- currently held by Roma's Edin Dzeko. He has some way to go if he's to catch Salah, though. The Liverpool man tops the lot when it comes to the European Golden Shoe, sitting three goals and six points clear of Messi as the season draws to close.",

Around 97,000 polling stations have been opened across this vast country, according to the Central Election Commission. Russians have a choice of eight candidates, including the communist Pavel Grudinin, a fruit-farm millionaire and Ksenia Sobchak, the daughter of Putin's political mentor.Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has called for a boycott of the election since he was squeezed out of the race. Read MoreOpposition activists as well as the non-governmental election monitoring group Golos were reporting voting irregularities on Sunday afternoon. By early evening, Golos had counted 2,000 incidents, including observers prevented from carrying out their work. Navalny himself tweeted a link to a video that purported to show ballot stuffing, where people post multiple votes in one ballot box,  in a polling station in Russia's far east. Russia's Central Election Commission has pledged to investigate irregularities, and has suspended two officials amid allegations of voting fraud in the Moscow working-class district of Lyubertsy, according to the Russian news agency TASS.It also claimed that its own website became the target of a hacking attack from 15 different countries before the polls opened, TASS reported.Turnout a concernThe biggest threat to the current team at the Kremlin in this election is a low turnout. The concern is that bored voters, certain that Putin will easily be re-elected, may not bother to vote. With just hours to go before polls closed, election officials said turnout was high, at almost 52%.The big push to get the vote out has been aided by a social media campaign. One video shows newlyweds arriving at a polling station in Tatarstan after tying the knot, the bride in a gorgeous white dress, accompanied by 40 wedding guests. Another tweet shows how to entice voters: put out a smorgasbord overflowing with food -- right in the middle of the polling station.In Moscow, some people voting were offered free food to eat, while there was heavily discounted food available for sale elsewhere.Presidential candidate Ksenia Sobchak smiles as she speaks to the media after voting during the Russian presidential election in Moscow.Too many 'joke candidates'A wave of anti-government protests in the past year suggests growing fatigue with corruption scandals seeping through the Kremlin and Putin's inner circle of oligarchs.Nonetheless, Putin is genuinely a popular figure among many Russians, who see him as a strongman who lifted the country out of post-Soviet chaos to stability.A woman exits a polling booth as she prepares to cast her ballot in the presidential election in Moscow.Great-grandmother Valentina Ivanova, 76, explained to CNN in Moscow why she was voting. \"It's a holiday... one that's important for me and my family and my country.\" \"My country is getting stronger -- its always been strong -- and we approve of the direction it's going in. But the most important thing is peace. We're a peaceful people. We would like out grandchildren to have peace and an overall good quality of life. My family are internationalists.\"Yugene Yarmakov, 23, who was voting for the first time, said there were too many \"joke candidates.\"\"I don't believe I'm going to influence anything,\" he told CNN.Polls in the past have also shown that Putin's popularity rises during times of confrontation with the West, so Russians appear to be shrugging off the current diplomatic crises. Russia-UK relations plunged into turmoil over the poisoning of a Russian ex-spy, his daughter and a police officer on British soil earlier this month. British Prime Minister Theresa May said it was \"highly likely\" the Kremlin was behind the attack, and both countries have expelled diplomats in an ongoing tit for tat. Russia has also vowed to retaliate after the United States imposed new sanctions on the country this week over its reported cyberattacks and meddling in the 2016 presidential election. In both cases, Moscow has dismissed the accusations of involvement in the attacks.Military sailors cast their ballots at a polling station in the Russian far eastern port city of Vladivostok.But such conflict with international powers is unlikely to hurt Putin at home.  In fact, he may be banking on confrontation with international players this election. His United Russia party helped parliament move the date of the vote to the fourth anniversary of Russia's annexation of Crimea from the Ukraine. Annexing the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 redefined Russia's role on the world stage and marked the beginning of new, heightened tensions with Western powers.Voters in Sevastopol, Crimea were given a medal engraved \"With Russia forever,\" RIA-Novosti reported, to commemorate the 2014 independence referendum, considered illegitimate by Ukraine, the US and its European allies. Only diplomats vote in UkraineIn a sign of continued tension between Kiev and Moscow, Ukraine said Sunday it would not allow Russians in the country to vote at Russian consulates, according to a statement from the government information agency, Ukrinform. The statement said only diplomats would have access to Russian diplomatic institutions on Ukrainian territory during the vote \"in order to avoid provocations and possible grave consequences.\" Russian diplomatic buildings in Ukraine would be heavily guarded by Ukrainian police, it added. Another Russian Presidential candidate is the ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. \"These are elections of the supreme ruler not only of Russia, but of the entire Planet Earth,\" he said after having cast his vote in Moscow.

His win cements his stature as the strongman who made Russia great again, but it also sets the stage for a crisis: Who will lead Russia next? Putin is constitutionally obliged to stand down in 2024, when he will have served two consecutive terms, but the 65-year-old veteran leader has not groomed a successor, prompting speculation that he may seek ways to extend his rule beyond 2024.\"Now the question is what kind of course he will choose in the future,\" Vygaudas U\u0161ackas, a former foreign minister of Lithuania and an observer of Russian politics, told CNN before the vote. \"That's a big gamble.

Putin has nurtured an image as the man who brought the country from crisis after the humiliating collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and a chaotic transition to a market economy.In his first years as president, he presided over strong economic growth, with Russia's economy buoyed by high global oil prices. His autocratic leadership style also plays well with a segment of the electorate; his re-election slogan is, \"A strong president, a strong Russia.\" Speaking to voters earlier this month, he expressed regret over the demise of the Soviet Union. Why Russia's presidential election is like no otherRussians have supported Putin's provocations of the West and his popularity has been immune to a diplomatic crisis with the UK and worsening US relations. Russians have also supported his drive to restore their country as a global power.In 2014, the Sochi Olympics signaled Russia's return to the world stage. That same year, the seizure of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine prompted a surge of patriotism, with Putin's approval rating soaring near 90%, according to Levada Center polls. It's no coincidence that the presidential election was moved to March 18, the fourth anniversary of Moscow's annexation of the peninsula, celebrated in Russia as Crimea Reunification Day.In his recent state of the nation address, Putin boasted of new \"invincible\" nuclear weapons, with an incendiary animated video showing the weapons striking what appeared to be a map of Florida.A Xi Jinping-style power grab?Observers say that Vladimir Putin may be taking Xi Jinping's lead.Putin already ushered in amendments to the constitution that extended Russia's presidential term from four years to six, and some observers wonder if he may contemplate changing the rules again to stay on beyond 2024, when he will be 72 years of age. Observers are now speculating that the Kremlin could look to the example set in Beijing. China's Communist Party is moving to amend the country's constitution to allow President Xi Jinping to serve a third term in office, potentially extending his presidency indefinitely. \"The action of Xi Jinping is kind of a road map for Putin,\" said Andrei Kolesnikov, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center.\"But Putin doesn't have a final decision how to behave after the elections, how to construct a mechanism of succession.\" JUST WATCHEDPutin is facing no real opposition. Here's why.ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPutin is facing no real opposition. Here's why. 03:47Over the next six-year term, Putin is likely to think about how to protect his own personal wealth and that of his inner circle.Openly grooming a successor before his term ends could be political suicide for him. If he hands over to someone else, the reasoning goes, his power and influence transfers to that person, and Putin's personal fortune -- officially modest but believed by some observers to be enormous -- will be at risk. Kolesnikov said that Putin presides over a court system with competing factions that include liberal technocrats and the hawkish siloviki -- veterans of the security services who occupy key positions in the government.There is a trust issue inside the Kremlin, he said. \"A lot of his cronies are not so trustworthy.\"\"This is the problem of the longevity of power. Just like Stalin after the war was very suspicious of his closest friends, he needs renewal of his administration in the broadest sense,\" Kolesnikov said.Russia's next political generationPutin scales a climbing wall at a summer camp run by the political Nashi youth group at Lake Seliger in northern Russia.Putin has tried to bring in fresh faces who owe complete loyalty to him, according to Kolesnikov.In 2016, for instance, Putin dismissed his long-serving chief of staff, KGB veteran Sergei Ivanov, and replaced him with a relative unknown, the fortysomething Anton Vaino.And last year, Putin replaced a number of officials, bringing in younger candidates who were shown on Russian television jumping off a cliff in an outdoor leadership course. Konstantin von Eggert, an independent political commentator, said the younger generation of loyalists wants to steer clear of the gerontocracy.\"The Vainos of his world think that they are going to take over,\" he said. \"They think there is going to be a succession, and Putin is going to hand over the reins of power.\"Some speculation centers on whether Dmitry Medvedev will stay on as prime minister in Putin's next term, signaling possible movement on succession plans.Putin, who first assumed the presidency on New Year's Eve in 1999, handed the mantle to Medvedev after serving the maximum two terms. Medvedev served one term and then stepped aside to allow Putin's return.U\u0161ackas, the Lithuanian former minister, said Medvedev proved his value to Putin when he loyally stepped aside. But Medvedev is embroiled in sweeping allegations of corruption that could make his ascension untenable.What is certain is that Putin isn't going anywhere soon.Putin remained confident throughout the election period, staying above the fray and abstaining from debate with the other candidates.\"Nurturing rivals is not what I need to do,\" he said in December. But will he nurture any successor? It's a question on the minds of those inside the Kremlin and ordinary Russians alike, and may be one that takes the next six years to answer.This story was first published in early March and has been updated to reflect Putin's victory in Sunday's election.",

Playing in his first Six Nations, 21-year-old Stockdale has enjoyed a storming campaign, bagging a Six Nations record seven tries. Ireland controlled the opening stages of the second half and Conor Murray extended his side's lead with a penalty. England was more sprightly in the final 20 minutes, but a second try from Daly and a score from Jonny May proved too little too late for the host. It was to be Ireland's day -- a St. Patrick's Day to remember for the players and fans.Wales, Scotland end tournament with winsElsewhere in the final weekend of Six Nations action, Scotland beat Italy 27-29 in Rome thanks to a late Greig Laidlaw penalty.

A late Tommaso Allan kick seemed to have won it for the host, but Laidlaw's boot struck a killer blow in the dying moments. In the tournament's final game, Wales narrowly edged out France 14-13 in Cardiff. An early Liam Williams try for the host was canceled out by Ga\u00ebl Fickou.The only points in the second half came from the boot of France's Maxime Machenaud, but that wasn't enough for Les Bleus to secure their first away victory of this this year's Six Nations.Visit cnn.com/rugby for more news and videosThe results mean Wales, Scotland and France respectively trail Ireland, while England slump to fifth -- its worst finish in 31 years.",

Nearby, Soviet buildings and statues puncture the skyline as a reminder of how this small nation was once ruled by its giant neighbor from Moscow.But the Baltic state is today a different place.

The technology has been rolled out in Italy, Spain and the USA, among other countries, each to varying degrees of success, but now it will be used on the biggest stage of all: the World Cup. At a meeting in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, the FIFA Council ratified the use of VAR for this summer's tournament in Russia after it was unanimously approved by football's law-making body IFAB earlier this month. VAR will be used in a World Cup for the first time this summerRewriting football history -- with the help of VARThe technology will still only be used to correct \"clear and obvious mistakes\" -- to allow or disallow goals, award or deny penalties, show or rescind red cards, or correct instances of mistaken identity when a referee disciplines the wrong player. A discord of opinionsRead MoreFIFA President Gianni Infantino has been a vocal advocate of VAR for some time, regularly voicing his support for the developing use of the technology and consistent in his opinion that the 2018 World Cup should be its grand premiere. Used for the first time in international competition at the Confederations Cup in Russia last year, Infantino stressed at the time the need for \"continuing tests\" but insisted that its use would make football a fairer game. FIFA President Gianni Infantino alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin at the draw for the 2018 World CupAhead of Friday's meeting, Infantino remained keen to reiterate VAR is a work in progress and while it has clear benefits, is not a fix-all solution to decision making.\"Video refereeing will bring much more to the transparency of football,\" he said. \"It isn't going to be the solution to everything in football -- what we want to do is avoid resounding mistakes by referees.\"FA Cup clash becomes first match in England to use VARMeanwhile, UEFA are yet to be convinced that video assistants are the way forward for the European game. On voting to leave the technology out of next season's Champions League last month, UEFA President Aleksander \u010ceferin said: \"Fans see the VAR screen all the time but nobody knows how it works.\"For me, it might be a good project but we shouldn't rush it,\" he added.But proponents of VAR continue to argue that on the biggest world stages, there should be no room for error. The case was made once more on Thursday, as Arsenal's Danny Welbeck appeared to dive, winning his side a penalty to draw level with AC Milan, which proved the turning point in the game as the Gunners went on to win 3-1, knocking the Italian side out of the Europa League.",

The British Embassy in Moscow told CNN it had been given a list of 23 specific individuals that were to be expelled from Russia.In comments to reporters after he left the Foreign Ministry, Bristow said the crisis had arisen because of \"the attempted murder of two people using a chemical weapon developed in Russia and not declared by Russia.\" He said Britain must defend itself.\"We have no dispute with the Russian people,\" he said. \"But we will always do what is necessary to defend ourselves, our allies, and our values against an attack of this sort, which is an attack not only on the United Kingdom, but upon the international rules-based system, on which all countries, all countries including Russia, depend for their safety and security.\"The UK Foreign Office said its priority was looking after its staff in Russia and helping those who will return to Britain.UK: Russia in 'flagrant breach' of lawAddressing members of her Conservative Party on Saturday, May said the Russian move had been \"anticipated\" and that Britain would consider its next steps in the coming days, when the National Security Council is due to meet.Russia's response does not change the fact that Moscow was in \"flagrant breach of international law\" and the Chemical Weapons Convention, she said.Former Soviet chemist shares details of the nerve agent Novichok The UK government was backed this week by allies France, Germany and the United States in its assessment that there was \"no plausible alternative explanation\" than that Russia was responsible for the Salisbury attack. UK officials believe the Skripals were exposed to a nerve agent known as Novichok that was developed in Russia.UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson upped the stakes Friday when he said it was \"overwhelmingly likely\" that Putin personally gave the order to use the nerve agent against the Skripals.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, speaking to CNN, slammed that remark. \"We have said on different levels and occasions that Russia has nothing to do with this story,\" he said. \"Any reference or mentioning of our President is nothing else but shocking and unpardonable diplomatic misconduct.\"Russia has insisted it is ready to cooperate in investigating the attack in Salisbury if Britain reciprocates by sharing the evidence it holds.Military personnel wearing protective suits remove a police car and other vehicles from a public car park on March 11, 2018, in Salisbury, England.UK police renewed their appeal Saturday for people who may have seen Sergei Skripal's burgundy BMW car on the morning of Sunday, March 4, to share what they know.About 400 witnesses have already come forward in what is \"extremely challenging and complex investigation,\" Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu of London's Metropolitan Police said. Officers also are trawling through some 4,000 hours of CCTV footage, he said.Glushkov murder investigationIn a dramatic twist Friday, the Metropolitan Police said that the death of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov, who was found dead Monday in his London home, was now being treated as murder.The UK's weak actions are unlikely to hurt Putin -- or his croniesA post-mortem exam on the Russian exile, who had links to compatriots who died in mysterious circumstances in the UK, \"gave the cause of death as compression to the neck,\" a police statement said. There's no evidence at this stage that his death and the attack on the Skripals are linked, it said. Russia's Investigative Committee said it had launched its own criminal proceedings in connection with the \"attempted murder of a Russian citizen, Yulia Skripal\" in Salisbury and the \"murder\" of Glushkov in London.UK-Russia relations have been fractious ever since the assassination of another former Russian spy, Alexander Litvinenko, in 2006.A UK inquiry found that two Russian agents poisoned Litvinenko at a London hotel bar in 2006 by spiking his tea with highly radioactive polonium-210, and that Putin \"probably approved\" Litvinenko's killing. The Kremlin has always denied the accusation.Sergei Skripal was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2006 for spying for Britain, according to Russian state media accounts of the closed hearing.Russian court officials at the time said he'd received at least $100,000 for his work for MI6, the British intelligence service.

        "content": "Story highlightsGreenland's capital Nuuk is getting a stylish new prisonHumane prisons are controversial, with some questioning whether criminals should live in beautiful buildingsGreenland's serious offenders, currently exiled in Denmark, are returning home\n\n\n (CNN)Nestled into the stunning Arctic landscape with panoramic views of sparkling fjords and snowy mountains, Ny Anstalt could easily be mistaken for a luxury ski lodge. But this stylish complex in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, is actually a prison.As any onlooker can deduce, when it opens in 2019 it will not be a normal penitentiary. It will be a \"humane prison\" -- a correctional facility that emphasizes rehabilitating criminals through positive design, rather than punishment.  Exponents of the \"humane prison\" philosophy believe that if prisons mimic the conditions of normal life, as far as is possible, offenders have a greater chance of successful reintegration into society, and less chance of re-offending. Ny Anstalt, however, is more than an architectural accomplishment for the country. It hopes to end a human rights issue that has haunted the island nation for decades.  Photos: Ny Anstalt prison is  under construction in Nuuk -- the capital of Greenland, 165 miles (265 kilometers) south of the Arctic Circle. Its architects, Danish firms Friis & Moltke, and Schmidt Hammer Lassen, have designed a \"humane\" penitentiary that operates like a small village, allowing inmates to lead a life that's as \"normal\" as possible. Studies show  that once released, inmates from humane prisons have a greater chance of successful reintegration into society, with lower rates of re-offending.  Hide Caption 1 of 9 Photos: Ny Anstalt's architects designed the arrival hall to look welcoming. They used glass panels so that incoming prisoners and visitors can see the staff inside, making the experience of entering less stressful. Hide Caption 2 of 9 Photos: Prisoners sleep one to a cell, and share spacious, comfortable living rooms, designed to promote socializing and a sense of community. The prison is also equipped with communal kitchens, workplaces, education and sports facilities, a library, a health center and a church.Hide Caption 3 of 9 Photos: Ny Anstalt under construction. The 130 square foot (12 square meter) cells are positioned to enjoy the best views of Sermitsiaq, a towering mountain on an offshore island.  Hide Caption 4 of 9 Photos: Ny Anstalt is situated on Lille Malene mountain. According to Jette Birkeskov Mogenson -- the project manager -- making the building straight and stable on the rocky, uneven slope was a technical challenge. The core of the building is made of concrete which can withstand the harsh Arctic climate. Hide Caption 5 of 9 Photos: Ny Anstalt's perimeter wall is designed to look less threatening than a typical prison wall. The architects brought in a local artist to create etchings of animals on its surface. The cells are designed so that inmates can see over the wall, to the sea and mountains beyond. Hide Caption 6 of 9 Photos: The prison is made of concrete clad with panels of weathered steel. The panels are arranged in an overlapping pattern to minimize gaps and keep out the snow. Trapped snow would alternately expand and contract as fluctuating temperatures cause it to melt and freeze, and this could weaken the facade structure. Hide Caption 7 of 9 Photos: The weathered steel rusts when exposed to air, forming a protective seal. \"It gets more beautiful with age as corrosion patterns develop,\" says project manager Jette Birkeskov Mogenson. The steel mirrors the reddish brown tones of Greenland's heathland plants and bushes, especially in the autumn. \"Even though the prison is a massive construction, it will blend into the landscape.\"Hide Caption 8 of 9 Photos: During spring, snowmelt and rocks cascade down the slopes of Lille Malene mountain. The architects enlarged channels under the buildings to control the massive water flows. Hide Caption 9 of 9Arctic architectureRead MoreNuuk is located near the southern tip of Greenland, a former Danish colony that straddles the Arctic circle. With only 56,000 residents, it is the least-densely populated country in the world.      Across this unfenced wilderness there are just six prisons with a collective capacity for 154 prisoners. Greenland runs a uniquely \"open\" prison system, with many inmates allowed to leave the premises to work, study, or even go hunting, before returning at night. As a consequence, none of the existing penitentiaries can accommodate high-security inmates, and this has long presented Greenland with a problem.Many Nordic countries have famously low crime rates: in Iceland, for example, there were only three homicides in 2015, according to European Union statistics. But in Greenland, the proportion of citizens sent to prison is about three times higher than in the rest of the Nordic region, according to the Danish Prison and Probation Service. Greenland's crime problem can be traced back to reforms instigated after the second world war. About 88% of the country's population are indigenous Inuit people -- the remaining 12% are mostly of Danish descent.  In the 1950s, the Danish government introduced sweeping changes, aimed at moving people into urban centers, giving them access to welfare services and reducing reliance on dwindling seal populations. But the dismantling of a traditional hunting and fishing society provoked social problems. \"Greenlandic people suffer from similar difficulties to other indigenous groups who have experienced colonization,\" says Naaja Nathanielsen, director of the Greenland Prison and Probation Service.\u00a0\"Alcohol is often involved in crime and contributes to the relatively high crime rate.\"   Without a suitable facility, since the 1960s, Greenland has sent its most dangerous -- and mentally ill -- inmates to Herstedvester, outside the Danish capital Copenhagen, says Erik Bang, head of the construction unit at the Danish Prison and Probation Service.  This has created issues as many speak Greenlandic (an Inuit language) rather than Danish so can't communicate with the guards, and it's impossible for most to receive visits from their families.  When Ny Anstalt opens, Nuuk's current prison, which was built in the 1960s, will close and its inmates will be transferred to the new facility. \"The practice of sending Greenlandic prisoners to Denmark will end,\" says Nathanielsen, adding that the 30 or so prisoners currently incarcerated in exile will be offered the chance to return to their home country. She says the new prison is long overdue. \"Exiling people to serve their sentence in another country, with another language and culture, is very harsh.\"A small villageIn 2013, Denmark's Prison and Probation Service, which administers the prison system in Greenland, launched a competition to design Nuuk's new jail. A team that includes two Danish architecture firms -- Friis & Moltke and Schmidt Hammer Lassen -- beat five rivals to win the contract. The architects say they embraced Ny Anstalt as an opportunity to help address Greenland's deep-rooted social problems. \"Learning about the prisoners and thinking about what conditions brought them to this situation has affected me deeply,\" says project manager Jette Birkeskov Mogensen. \"Providing them with a good environment for their imprisonment is a big responsibility.\"  Photos: Scandinavia's humane prisonsEast Jutland State Prison, Denmark \u2013 Friis & Moltke architects -- who are part of the team working on Nuuk's new prison -- designed East Jutland State Prison which opened in 2006.

With a focus on rehabilitation, its facilities include a gym, a rock-climbing wall, jogging trails, a soccer field, a library, a music studio, a small hospital, a dental clinic, and a Family House where prisoners can stay overnight with their partners and children.Hide Caption 5 of 9 Photos: Scandinavia's humane prisonsHalden Prison, Norway \u2013 The cells in Halden prison are equipped with private en-suite bathrooms, flatscreen TVs, mini-fridges and large windows without bars that let the sunlight stream in.

Its 250 inmates are each given a 40 square foot cell with a TV, fridge, private bathroom and large window. According to the prison's architects, C.F. M\u00f8ller, the design \"supports the inmates' mental and physical well-being and also ensures a secure and pleasant workplace for employees.\" The complex echoes the structure and scale of a small provincial community.

The prison building forms a quadrangle around \"The Park,\" an open space with mature trees, picnic tables, benches and tennis courts. The pleasant environment encourages the prisoners to hang out in small groups, chatting and relaxing, while the natural landscape promotes wellbeing. Hide Caption 9 of 9 Thomas Ruus Christensen, Ny Anstalt's lead design architect, says that the prison -- which has won a World Architecture News Award -- is \"designed to operate like a small village with residential blocks, workplaces, education and sports facilities, a library, a health center and a church.\" The 86,000 square foot (8,000 square meter) facility will have 76 cells, 40 of which will be \"closed\" for maximum security prisoners, while 36 will be \"open\" for those allowed greater degrees of freedom. Prisoners who have earned the privilege will be allowed to travel into Nuuk to work and earn a wage, before returning to the prison at night.The private cells are only 130 square feet (12 square meters) but are positioned to look across to Sermitsiaq, a towering mountain on an offshore island, and their windows don't have bars. Christensen says this wild outlook was a design priority. \"You can't escape the prison because it's surrounded by a big wall, but you can look at the view and escape in your mind -- and that's important,\" says Christensen.   Although the prison is a modern building, Ny Anstalt will be decorated with traditional Greenland flourishes. \"There's a very distinctive artistic language in Greenland,\" says Christensen. \"We're bringing in local artists to decorate communal areas with landscape paintings and traditional designs, and carve etchings of animals into the perimeter wall.\"Design has even been used to manage security at the facility. \"The prison is designed over three levels which allows the guards to manage the flow of people between different areas, and control which prisoners encounter each other,\" explains Mogenson. This reduces the possibility of violence. \"The guards don't need to carry weapons, and can develop better relationships with the prisoners, which is essential to the concept of rehabilitation,\" she adds. Do humane prisons work?Scandinavian countries have pioneered humane prison design because \"their societies are characterized by a strong welfare state and relatively high levels of trust,\" according to Yvonne Jewkes, a professor of criminology at the UK's University of Kent.\"There's also an ancient idea (in Scandanavia) that beauty has a civilizing influence,\" says Jewkes. \"Whether it's a coffee cup or a prison, Danish design is always stylish. In prison design, this means light, airy, non-institutional spaces.\"  In 2010, a new gold standard for this type of prison was set by a Halden, a 227-inmate, high security, Norwegian penitentiary, often cited as the \"model\" humane prison. Its facilities include a gym, a rock-climbing wall, jogging trails, a soccer field, a library, a music studio, a dental clinic, and a Family House where prisoners can stay overnight with their partners and children. In 2010, it won the Arnstein Arneberg Award for interior design, although it has also been criticized for being too liberal. A humanely designed prison, says Jewkes, can help to foster a sense of purpose, citizenship and hope for the future, which is important because \"at some point, the vast majority of prisoners are going to be released.\"     The statistics seem to back her up. \"A number of studies indicate that reoffending rates are relatively low in Scandinavian countries -- often less than 30%,\" says Jewkes. Rates appear to be much higher in the US and UK. A study by the US Bureau of Justice, which tracked prisoners from 30 states after their release from prison in 2005, found that within five years over three quarters (76.6%) had been rearrested. In the UK, government reporting from 2015 revealed that 44% of adults are reconvicted within a year of their release.Jewkes cautions that it is notoriously difficult to make direct comparisons. \"Each country's legal system is different, methods of counting and evaluation vary ... and there have not been many long-term studies.\" But she also notes that \"it's a matter of common sense that the values embedded in a custodial environment will be embodied by ex-offenders when they are released and re-enter society.\"In the UK, \"prisons are like human warehouses, designed to be tools of retribution,\" says Jewkes. \"Ugly, depressing environments like these breed anger and resentment, and can promote drug use, mental illness, self-harm and suicide.\" Alan Pritchard, a British former prison governor who now works as a private consultant on criminal justice matters, says that humane prison design works in Scandinavia because \"attitudes to incarceration are much more liberal.\" \"I don't think beautiful, architect-designed prisons would be palatable to either the government or the public in the UK,\" he adds.Size mattersThe other thing that sets apart Scandinavian prison design is size.Prisons that look like boutique hotels typically house no more than 250 inmates. In Scandinavia, where small population sizes combine with low rates of incarceration, there are not that many people to detain -- Denmark has just 3,400 prisoners; Norway has around 4,000. Both countries have populations of just over 5 million. In England and Wales (Scotland operates as a separate jurisdiction), where the population is 10 times larger, around 85,000 people are kept behind bars.      Two new British prisons -- HMP Oakwood and HMP Berwyn -- can house 2,106 prisoners each, and there are plans for more \"supersize\" jails that hold over 1,000 prisoners. Pritchard says that although both the new prisons have education and employment training facilities, their design incorporates heavy security. \"With all the gates, barriers, and fences, these prisons don't effectively support a rehabilitative culture,\" says Pritchard.The bottom lineHumane prisons are seen as prohibitively expensive. Running Norways's Halden prison costs $150,000 per prisoner per year, according to the Norwegian Correctional Service. Pritchard says the current average annual cost per prisoner in England and Wales is $50,000, while HMP Berwyn -- which benefits from economies of scale -- will operate at around $20,000. \"Accommodating 85,000 inmates in multiple small units is not economically viable,\" he says.Ny Anstalt's running costs have not yet been finalized. \"No doubt it will increase the current budget, but in terms of the human factor it is very much worth the expense,\" says Nathanielsen.  For those with shorter term sentences, she believes Ny Anstalt offers a greater chance of successful rehabilitation. \"We live in small communities in Greenland, and eventually the inmates have to return to those communities. For that to be successful, and to prevent future crime, we strive to promote change in each individual. In that regard, humane design absolutely makes sense.\"",

Police said there was no information to suggest the attack was motivated by racial hate, but authorities will \"continue to keep an open mind.\" A 17-year-old girl was arrested on suspicion of \"assault occasioning grievous bodily harm\" and has been released on bail.Egypt's foreign ministry said it was following the case through the Egyptian Embassy in London and would work with the family's lawyer to make sure the attackers were brought to justice.

Nadal has been \"living with pain and painkillers since 2005,\" Toni said Thursday at the Congreso Murcia Sport & Business conference in Murcia, Spain. \"For this reason he's considered his well-being above wins and many times he's told me that he would have liked to win less in exchange for having less pain.\" Follow @cnnsport\n\nRead MoreSignificant injury problemsInjuries indeed have been an ever present for Nadal, though he still currently sits second behind Roger Federer on the men's grand slam ladder. And in a feat that will perhaps go unmatched, he has won the French Open 10 times.Nadal's knees have most often been the culprit but his feet, back, wrist and hamstring have also caused him significant injury problems. He underwent appendix surgery too in 2014 and a hip injury sustained in the Australian Open quarterfinals against Marin Cilic two months ago realistically cost the 31-year-old a spot in the final in Melbourne. READ: Heartbreak continues for Nadal in MelbourneNadal subsequently withdrew late from a tournament in Acapulco last month and then pulled out of Indian Wells and Miami, the two biggest combined events outside the grand slams. His style of play -- more taxing than Federer -- is arguably a contributory factor in his litany of injuries while Nadal has more than once said there are too many hard-court tournaments.   Targeting Davis CupNadal disclosed in his autobiography that a congenital foot issue in 2005 almost ended his career -- at the age of 19 -- and Toni said it led to a number of complications. \"The specialist we went to told us that Rafael's career was pretty much finished,\" said Toni. \"Well, in 2005 Rafael had to constantly live in pain. From that time on, we couldn't finish training sessions a lot of times. \"A lot of times -- almost always -- he would have to take a painkiller because the pain would get worse and worse as the games went on. \"Because of some insoles that he started using, which solved his foot problem, he started having problems in his knee, back and other parts of his body.\"But Nadal has always found a way to recover from his ailments and this time hopes to be ready for Spain's Davis Cup quarterfinal against Germany in Valencia from April 6-8. On Wednesday, Nadal was swimming in an effort to aid his recovery.     Cada d\u00eda mejor / Improving everyday \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffd A post shared by  Rafa Nadal (@rafaelnadal) on Mar 15, 2018 at 4:22am PDT The tie is being played on clay, the gentlest surface for Nadal and the one on which he has won everything -- landing that unprecedented 10th French Open title in 2017 after defeating Stan Wawrinka. If Nadal -- 22-1 in singles in the Davis Cup, losing only to former world No. 5 Jiri Novak -- does play, it would mark his first home appearance in the soon-to-be revamped competition since 2013. \"I spoke with him and his goal is to play it,\" said Toni. \"Obviously, we, or rather he, will see how he is. If he's recovered, then surely he'll play.\"Toni stopped traveling with his nephew last year and now spends much of his time working at Nadal's academy in the family's hometown of Manacor in Mallorca.JUST WATCHEDThe Matador's dream comes trueReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe Matador's dream comes true 05:11\"I don't speak to him directly about tennis,\" said Toni, also tournament director of the women's Mallorca Open in June. \"I ask him how he is, you know, how an uncle asks, since I want everything to go well for him.\"He still follows the game and is convinced his nephew is the man to beat on clay this season, despite the hip injury. \"I haven't really asked him, but I think he's got the maximum expectations. Last year, things went really well for him. The year before that ... until he picked up the injury, things went very well for him on clay,\" said Toni, referring to the wrist injury that forced a tearful Nadal to bail from the 2016 French Open in the first week. \"I don't think there's any reason to think that they won't go as well this year. Each year is more difficult, that's reality. But I think this year, in my view, the No. 1 guy to have a good clay season is Rafael.\" Toni won't be at Roland Garros this year -- after he presented Nadal with a replica \"Decima\" trophy following the 2017 final. Yet he has settled into life away from the tennis tour. Toni Nadal (left) holds up a replica \"Decima\" trophy after his nephew won a 10th French Open title in 2017.

        "content": "Moscow (CNN)The recent Russia headlines have been alarming: The poisoning of a Russian double agent in England set off a diplomatic confrontation between Moscow and London; the Trump administration announced new sanctions on Russia for attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election; and the US ambassador to the United Nations warned that Washington was \"prepared to act\" if the Russian-backed regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad continued to pummel the rebel-held enclave of Eastern Ghouta.The response from Russia? A collective shrug.Yevgeny Prigozhin \u2014 a confidante of Russian President Vladimir Putin indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller for allegedly meddling in the 2016 election \u2014 reflected the official mood when he said he \"couldn't care less\" about the new US sanctions, and that he would \"stop going to McDonald's,\" state news agency RIA-Novosti reported Thursday. Russia has delivered weeks of sensational headlines. Before the poisoning of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the English city of Salisbury on March 4, a self-described Russian \"seductress\" offered a tantalizing new twist to the Russian scandal rocking Washington, saying she wanted American help to escape a Thai detention center in exchange for information on alleged links between US President Donald Trump and Russia. Before that, revelations emerged about US airstrikes that killed and injured dozens of Russian mercenaries in Syria in February.   British military personnel wearing protective coveralls work to remove a vehicle connected to the March 4 nerve agent attack in Salisbury.But Russians can be forgiven for not taking much notice. The biggest domestic news in Russia by far is the presidential election on Sunday, which Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to win by a wide margin. On Friday, the last official day of campaigning before voters go to the polls, Russia's state-run Rossiya 24 featured heavy coverage of the last-minute speeches and appearances by the candidates.Read MoreAs news hit of new US Treasury sanctions on Russia on Thursday, Rossiya 24 focused in part on a story in neighboring Ukraine, where the country's top prosecutor had accused Nadia Savchenko, a war hero and nationalist member of parliament, of backing an alleged coup plot. (Savchenko, who has parliamentary immunity from prosecution, says the charges are politically motivated). That's unsurprising: Russian state-run media loves to highlight stories that show the apparent chaos of Ukraine and its Western-backed government.Mocking the USAnd earlier in the week, there was a bit of schadenfreude over the political wrangling in Washington.Olga Skabeeva, an anchor on state television, mocked the firing of US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by Trump. \"Yesterday, Tillerson supported Theresa May in her 'highly likely' (#Skripal poisoning) allegation. So Trump immediately fired him. Trump is ours!\" she wrote on the Telegram messaging service. The investigation into the Skripal poisoning and fanfare in Washington over new sanctions on Russia are described by Russian officials with one word: Russophobia, shorthand for what they describe as a deliberate campaign by the West to malign the country.In a briefing Thursday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova suggested that the media uproar over Russia was part of a \"colossal campaign to contain Russia and attempts to isolate it,\" a conspiracy backed by the \"representatives of the American establishment.\"'A fashion trend' to blame RussiaSuch views filter down to the Russian street.Alexei Popov, a 25-year-old resident of Moscow, said hedidn't believe the Russians had poisoned Skripal.\"It could be Americans, it could be anyone,\" he said. \"It's now a fashion trend to point fingers at Russia. They just have such low opinion of us which is not good.\"Vladimir Vorontsov, 37, said he also saw a deliberate Western campaign amid the headlines. \"This anti-Russian machine has been hyped up to a great extent, and I think this is the continuation of that,\" he said.But real dangers persist amid the propaganda. In an interview earlier this week, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the Russian General Staff, made clear that any US strike against Damascus could prompt Russian retaliation.Gen. Valery Gerasimov (C), chief of the Russian General Staff,  speaks to Foreign Minister Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in this 2016 file photo.Noting that Russian advisers are embedded with the Syrian military, he said, \"In event of a threat to their lives, Russian Armed Forces will take retaliatory measures both on missiles and the launchers that will use them,\" Russian news agencies reported.More than anything, however, Putin dominates the agenda in Russia. In a video statement issued Friday, he urged fellow citizens to go the polls and cast a vote. He didn't appear as a candidate, but the message was clear: The Russian government wants a high turnout, something that would boost the likely winner's legitimacy.\"Use your power to choose the future of our great country, Russia, which all of us hold dear,\" he said.Additional reporting by Marshall Cohen and Mary Ilyushina in Moscow",

        "content": "(CNN)The French take their bread very, very seriously. In fact, there are whole sets of laws that govern which type of bread can be called what, and when and how often bakeries can stay open.One such law in France's political region of Aube states that bakeries must close at least one day a week -- a day of rest.So when local baker Cedric Vaivre elected to stay open every day of the week in order to make the most out of the busy summer season in 2017, he was hit with a serious fine: \u20ac3000, or about $3,700, according to French media. Now, supporters from his town of Lusigny-sur-Barse are trying to get the fee waived and change the rule, which is referred to as the Prefectural Decree of 15 December 1994 (more generally, the country's web of persnickety bread rules dates back to the French Revolution). An online petition to change the rule has more than 2,000 signatures. That's pretty impressive given that Lusigny-sur-Barse only had about 2,000 residents in 2014.  Read More\"To the workers' inspector and the city government: Help our bakery!\" the petition reads. (A workers' inspector is a labor agency, like OSHA.) Vaivre told French radio station, RMC, he didn't agree with the fine and that he just loves his job. \"We've got to stop [penalizing] people who work,\" he said.Frederic Amiot, president of the Bakers and Pastrymakers Patron Federation of Aube, defended the law. \"We understand that Mr. Vaivre wants to work more during the tourist season to make ends meet, but this law applies to all of the bakeries,\" he told France's L'est eclair. The French obviously take work-life balance as seriously as bread. In January 2017, France passed a law that gives workers the right to limit their out-of-office and after-hours correspondence. The country's 35-hour work week has been in place since 2000, but various reforms have softened these rules over time and some industries are granted special exceptions.",

UK officials believe they were exposed to a nerve agent known as Novichok that was developed in Russia.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov slammed Johnson's remark in a comment to CNN.The UK's weak actions are unlikely to hurt Putin -- or his cronies\"We have said on different levels and occasions that Russia has nothing to do with this story,\" he said. \"Any reference or mentioning of our President is nothing else but shocking and unpardonable diplomatic misconduct.\" Read MoreRussia has repeatedly dismissed the UK's accusations as \"unfounded\" and warned it would retaliate over the expulsion of its diplomats.Speaking alongside his Polish counterpart at the Battle of Britain Bunker in outer London, Johnson said the UK and its allies were waiting for a serious response from Russia about the nerve agent attack.\"The quarrel of the UK government is not with Russian people -- it is not with Russians living here in this country. We have nothing against the Russians themselves. There is to be no Russophobia as a result of what has happened,\" he said. \"Our quarrel is with Putin's Kremlin and with his decision -- and we think it is overwhelmingly likely that it was his decision -- to direct the use of a nerve agent on the streets of the UK, on the streets of Europe, for the first time since the Second World War.\"Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz expressed his \"full solidarity\" with the UK, adding he was prepared to work with other European Union and NATO countries to protest against Russia's behavior.\"We condemn this unprecedented attack by Russia on the territory of the United Kingdom. This use of chemical weapons is a clear violation of the international law,\" he said.Police official Kier Pritchard and British Prime Minister Theresa May view the crime scene in Salisbury.Russia launches proceedings Russia has insisted it is ready to cooperate in investigating the attack in Salisbury if Britain reciprocates by sharing the evidence it holds -- and has dismissed accusations against it as \"propaganda\" by the UK government.Vassily Nebenzia, Moscow's ambassador to the United Nations, even suggested at an emergency session of the UN Security Council that the UK might have been responsible for the attack in an attempt to smear Russia.Former Soviet chemist shares details of the nerve agent Novichok On Friday, Russia's Investigative Committee said it had launched its own criminal proceedings in connection with the \"attempted murder of a Russian citizen, Yulia Skripal\" in Salisbury and what it called the \"murder\" of Nikolai Glushkov in London.Glushkov, a Russian exile who had links to compatriots who died in mysterious circumstances in the UK, was found dead in his London home this week.London's Metropolitan Police said Friday it had launched a murder investigation into Glushkov's death following the results of a post-mortem exam, which gave the cause of death as \"compression to the neck.\"Counterterrorism police are leading the investigation \"because of the associations Mr. Glushkov is believed to have had,\" a police statement said. \"At this stage there is nothing to suggest any link to the attempted murders in Salisbury, nor any evidence that he was poisoned.\"In an online post, the Russian committee said the attempt on Yulia Skripal's life was \"committed in a dangerous manner endangering other people, in Salisbury.\"The investigation will be carried out in accordance with \"Russian and international law,\" it said, adding that \"investigators are ready to work together with competent authorities in Great Britain.\" The statement made no mention of Sergei Skripal.'An assault on UK sovereignty'On Thursday, the United States issued a joint statement with France, Germany and the UK condemning the nerve agent attack as \"an assault on UK sovereignty\" and saying there was \"no plausible alternative explanation\" than that Russia was responsible.Nerve gas attack unsettles residents in English cathedral cityMeanwhile, British Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson said Moscow had made a \"deliberate political decision\" to poison Skripal. He accused Russia of \"ripping up the international rulebook\" and \"attempting to \"subvert, undermine and influence\" countries around the world.\"Russia should shut up and go away,\" Williamson said. \"It's often described as a cool war that we are entering -- I would say it is feeling exceptionally chilly at the moment.\"UK-Russia relations have been fractious ever since the assassination of another former Russian spy, Alexander Litvinenko, in 2006.A UK inquiry found that two Russian agents poisoned Litvinenko at a London hotel bar in 2006 by spiking his tea with highly radioactive polonium-210, and that Putin \"probably approved\" Litvinenko's killing. The Kremlin has always denied the accusation.Sergei Skripal was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2006 for spying for Britain, according to Russian state media accounts of the closed hearing.Russian court officials at the time said he'd received at least $100,000 for his work for MI6, the British intelligence service. He was granted refuge in the UK after a high-profile spy exchange between the United States and Russia in 2010.CNN's Frederik Pleitgen, Darya Tarasova and Sebastian Shukla contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Moscow (CNN)In the last four years, Russia has annexed Crimea from Ukraine, meddled in a US election and helped turn the tide of the Syrian war in Bashar al-Assad's favor. Now it's in a major diplomatic row with the UK, which blames Moscow for the poisoning of a former spy, his daughter, and a British policeman in the English countryside. The UK's top defense official said Thursday that Russia was \"ripping up the international rulebook.\" Such an accusation is likely music to President Vladimir Putin's ears -- his popularity tends to spike when Russia confronts the West, polls show. He is well on track to retain power in an election this Sunday, but he is showing a growing appetite for power beyond his country's borders, and Russia is beginning to fill the void in parts of the world where the US once wielded influence. Here are some ways Russia is stepping up around the globe. Read MorePropagandaEx-CIA chief John Brennan testifies to the House Intelligence Committee that he saw information showing \"contacts and interactions\" between Russian officials and the Trump campaign.Accusations that Russia meddled in the 2016 US election -- the same election that saw Donald Trump's meteoric rise -- have rocked Washington and led to several formal investigations.US intelligence agencies accuse Russia of hacking into and releasing the emails Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman and other servers belonging to the Democratic Party. This was in an attempt, they say, to influence the outcome of the vote. European nations have been dealing with Russian cyber-meddling for some time, cybersecurity researchers say, and the UK, France and Germany have all accused Russia of trying to influence votes in their countries. British Prime Minister Theresa May gave a stern warning to Russia in November last year, accusing it of trying to \"weaponize information\" to disrupt the world order. One of the same troll armies that meddled in America's 2016 election, a CNN analysis found, also posted dozens of pro-Brexit messages on the  day the UK held a referendum and voted to leave the European Union. The troll army has established ties to the Russian government. Germany accused Russia of propagating fake news to stir far-right sentiments in the country and in June last year it passed a law to tackle fake news, forcing online platforms to remove false reports within 24 hours or face hefty fines.Military powerA T-80 battle tank during a fire demonstration at the Patriot military park outside Moscow.President Putin has boasted about Russia's military might many times, and Syria has felt the force of that power profoundly in recent years. Russian warplanes have bombed territory, and mercenaries and advisers on the ground have supported offensives to prop up Syrian President Assad. Russia's firepower has helped turn the war around in Assad's favor and has made the country a game-changing player in the complex multi-sided conflict. That role also means a stronger foothold in the Middle East for Russia. Russia's military power also enabled Moscow to annex the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. It was a move that led to sanctions and condemnation from the West but one that perhaps boosted Russia's image as a major world power. Russia still backs separatists in Ukraine.Elsewhere, Russia has increased its military influence in Libya, a country still in chaos since the 2011 death of Moammar Gadhafi in the Arab Spring. Moscow is courting Gen. Khalifa Haftar in the country, a rival of the fragile UN-backed coalition government in Tripoli.Russian forces have also held joint military drills with Egypt on Russian soil, with plans to host the exercises this year in Egypt.Arms salesPhilippine President Rodrigo Duterte, front left, with Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, right,  after the delivery of Russian arms to the Southeast Asian nation. There has been much talk about a global arms race as world powers increase their nuclear stockpiles, but there is also a race between Russia and the US to sell conventional arms. Russia is the second-biggest exporter of arms behind the US, and it is finding markets in countries that traditionally bought American-made weapons, especially in Asia and the Middle East, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri). India was the world's largest importer of major arms between 2013 and 2017, Sipri data shows. Russia accounted for 62% of India's arms imports, during that same period.Military officials in the US, Europe and Afghanistan are concerned that Russia may also be providing supplies to the Taliban in Afghanistan.Russia is selling arms to countries in Southeast Asia as well, including Indonesia and Myanmar. Russia donated weapons and military equipment to the Philippines last year and signed agreements for arms exports, CNN Philippines reports. Countering US influenceRussia has forged new alliances in an attempt to counter the US' global influence.Last year, Russia's finance ministry came to the aid of crisis-hit Venezuela with a deal to restructure sovereign debt, making Moscow the primary foreign backer of President Nicolas Maduro.The burgeoning relationship with Venezuela has given Russia an important economic and political foothold in Latin America, just as already soured US-Venezuelan relations declined further. It's a two-way street: In December, Venezuela awarded licenses to a unit of Rosneft, Russia's state-controlled oil company, to develop offshore gas fields. Closer to home, Russia has historical and cultural ties in the Balkans and the Kremlin is keen to use these links to counter NATO expansion in the region. In 2017, officials in Montenegro alleged that Russian security services were involved in a plot to overthrow the government, after Montenegro was formally invited to join NATO. Russia denied the allegations. Russia has tried to boost ties with eastern European nations that are not NATO members, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Macedonia.  Energy supplyRussia has used its oil production to boost ties with countries in the Middle East and Asia in recent years.Many former Soviet nations in eastern Europe rely heavily on Russian oil and gas to fuel their economies, with Poland, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary and Lithuania among them. Most are trying to diversify their energy sources to reduce their dependence on the Russian state.Roughly a third of the European Union's natural gas still comes from Russia, which has made it difficult for the union to impose sanctions on the country.Some parts of Europe are expanding energy ties with Russia. Hungary -- whose leader Viktor Orb\u00e1n has been compared to Putin -- is extending its Soviet-era nuclear power station with Russian financing.Russia in the meantime is looking to grow its energy market elsewhere.In Iraq, Russian state oil company Rosneft has signed contracts to gain control of the main oil pipeline in the Kurdistan region, boosting Russia's influence there.It has also teamed up with Saudi Arabia -- another country with an oil-dependent economy -- and agreed to extend oil production cuts to buoy global prices.Middle East diplomacyRussian President Vladimir Putin, right, with Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud in Moscow on October 5, 2017.Russia has increased its diplomatic contacts across the Middle East. Iran, a longtime adversary of the US, is allied with Russia on the ground in Syria, and the two countries have also stepped up official visits recently. But Russia has also boosted relations with Iran's regional rivals. Last year, the Kremlin gave a lavish welcome to Saudi Arabia's King Salman, and earlier this year, Putin hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Russia is working with Israel to agree on certain responses to the Syrian conflict. Israel opposes keeping Assad in power, but in 2015 it agreed with Russia to \"deconflict\" military operations in the war-torn country to avoid accidental clashes in the skies.Elsewhere in the region, Russia has expanded contacts with Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.Russia has also become closer to Turkey in facing the Syria crisis, and Putin speaks routinely with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Middle Eastern issues. The countries managed to repair ties quickly after Turkey shot down a Russian warplane near the Syrian border in 2015.Russia hasn't had the same kind of rapprochement with the US, despite Putin and Trump repeatedly promising a restoration of relations. And as Russian tensions with other Western countries rise, the next six years could see the world change yet again.    Zahid Mahmood contributed to this report.",

Wallstrom spokesman Pezhman Fivrin said Friday that the talks had been extended by a day, without elaborating.  Ri's arrival in the Swedish capital is the first significant diplomatic move by Pyongyang since President Donald Trump said a week ago he would be willing to meet North Korea's Kim Jong Un.\"We believe in dialogue and the political process, but we are not na\u00efve,\" Wallstrom said. \"We are hoping that if we can use our role and also our contacts there, we will put it to the best use, and then it's for the parties to decide.\"Read MoreEarlier Friday, Ri also met Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, the latter's press secretary, Erik Nises, told CNN. \"They met this morning and discussed the same issues that are being discussed during this trip, such as the security situation,\" he said.History in the making The historically neutral European country, whose embassy represents US interests in the North Korean capital, has often played the role of intermediary in discussions between Washington and Pyongyang.Should the leaders of the two nations sit down, it would be the first time that a sitting US President has met with the leader of the reclusive Asian nation. Earlier, Lofven had said that Stockholm is willing to host the historic summit.\"We really want to help out,\"  Lofven said in an interview with Sweden's TV4 network.\"If we can help and provide a forum for this and support this process, then this is something we should do.\"Sweden is one of a handful of places analysts believe could host the meeting, along with Switzerland, the neutral nation where Kim went to school; the Joint Security Area in the Demilitarized Zone that divides North and South Korea; and China, which has diplomatic relations with the United States and North Korea and has hosted Kim's father, the late Kim Jong Il.The North Korean diplomatic delegation arrives in the Swedish capital of Stockholm for talks.The discussions between Ri and Wallstrom are to \"focus on Sweden's consular responsibilities as a protecting power for the United States, Canada and Australia,\" the Swedish government said when the visit was announced.The first meeting, held Thursday, was brief, but both sides were to have \"plenty of time to discuss the matters at hand\" Friday, said Pezhman Fivrin, a spokesman for Wallstrom.JUST WATCHEDTrump and Kim: What could go right (or wrong)?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTrump and Kim: What could go right (or wrong)? 02:36Diplomatic silenceNorth Korea has yet to make official comment on a proposed face-to-face meeting. Trump accepted an invitation from Kim when a South Korean delegation delivered it verbally in Washington. But diplomatic sources have signaled enough confidence in South Korea's words and actions that most of the parties are pressing ahead.The idea that Trump and Kim would sit down together was unthinkable just months ago when North Korea was regularly testing weapons in its pursuit of developing a missile that could deliver a nuclear warhead to the United States.The diplomatic wheels started turning rapidly at the beginning of the year when the two Koreas worked to bring a handful of athletes from the North to compete in the Winter Olympics in South Korea.Since the end of the Games last month, Kim has hosted a high-level delegation from Seoul, which delivered the summit offer to Trump.Journalist Per Nyberg contributed to this report.",

However, after he gave the French Open a miss last year, Federer's longtime coach and friend Severin L\u00fcthi told The New York Times: \"I'm very confident that Roger will play the French Open again.\"Madrid on the cards? If Federer avoids the dirt again it would undoubtedly aid his 36-year-old body and boost his chances of a repeat success at Wimbledon. He has already said he won't play in Monte Carlo next month, so that would leave Madrid and Rome in May as targets if he is to realistically feature at Roland Garros, which is the second grand slam of the season.And given his dominant form, Federer must be tempted.  JUST WATCHED Federer as you've never heard him before ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH Federer as you've never heard him before  02:11He returned to No. 1 in February after a five-year absence -- becoming the oldest No. 1 -- and has defeated Nadal five straight times after the Spaniard had routinely won their duels. None of those victories were on clay but this season indeed could mark Federer's greatest opportunity of topping Nadal at the French Open -- something he has never done -- including if the Mallorcan is 100% fit. \"If he plays, he'd be one of (Nadal's) biggest rivals,\" Nadal's uncle and traveling coach through last season, Toni, told a group of reporters at a conference in Murcia, Spain on Thursday. Federer is 0-5 against Nadal on the Parisian clay, suffering one of his worst ever defeats in the 2008 final when he claimed just four games. Nadal meanwhile has toppled Federer at the grand slam the latter is most associated with, Wimbledon, a month later in 2008 in what many consider the greatest tennis match of all time.

        "content": "(CNN)Like many small children, Romanian Cosmin Lambru would frequently walk through the streets of his hometown, talking to his friends about football.It was on one of those daily walks in Ploie\u0219ti that Lambru, an aspiring footballer in the youth ranks of the city's football team FC Petrolul, was the victim of a freak incident that would change his life forever.Follow @cnnsport\n\n\"When I was seven, I was involved in an accident,\" Lambru tells CNN Sport. \"I was with three or four friends on the sidewalk. \"I was at a crossroads and a truck lost its balance and caught my arm, which ended up being trapped between some gas pipes and the truck itself. As a result of the impact, my fingers got crushed.\"Living in Ploie\u0219ti, a modest industrial city of some 200,000 people -- 56 kilometers north of Romania's capital Bucharest -- Lambru had been playing for local club FC Petrolul since the age of four.Read MoreHe grew up fanatically supporting the local club and, like many of his friends, dreamed of wearing the brightly colored kit of the \"Yellow Wolves.\"His dream eventually came true and when an 18-year-old Lambru made his professional debut in a Romanian Cup match for his childhood club in October last year, his name made headlines all around the world.But it wasn't his debut, a goal or a piece of skill that caught people's attention. Their attention was drawn to a white bandage strapped tightly to his left arm, which supported a prosthetic limb.AccidentThe accident severely and irreparably damaged Lambru's left hand from the middle of his forearm down.Despite the life-changing incident, Lambru still talks about the \"luck\" he had that day after being rushed to hospital.\"Of course I was afraid I would never return to play football,\" he recalls, speaking from FC Petrolul's training base. \"At the time of the accident I was building up my career. But I managed to stay strong and my family stood alongside me.\"My biggest luck was the fact that I was treated by a fantastic doctor when I arrived at the hospital, Dr. Otilia Racasan. She managed to save my joint. \"If she hadn't performed the operation, I would have ended up fracturing my hand at every fall and that would've certainly meant the end of my playing career and my dream.\"Lambru also credits the support and compassion of FC Petrolul and its coaches in allowing him to realize his dream and make it as a professional.\"I stayed in the hospital for about a month after the accident,\" he says. \"My teammates and my coaches visited me more than once a week. \"They told me to be brave, to keep my feet on the ground and to try and get some motivation out of the whole situation.\"His father, himself a former professional footballer in Romania, was the person who initially encouraged Lambru to continue his pursuit of a career in football. Even after the amputation, that support never wavered.\"He told me not to give up on my childhood dream,\" Lambru says. \"The accident made me a more ambitious person and now I give 100% of myself at every training session. \"Nothing will stop me from achieving my dream.\"JUST WATCHEDLegless F1 driver masters handcyclingReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLegless F1 driver masters handcycling 04:08AdaptingAfter he came out of hospital, Lambru initially found it difficult adjusting to his new prosthetic arm; the way it felt and the changes it made to his speed and balance.\"But in time I managed to adapt to it,\" he says. \"Especially when I fall after a foul on the pitch, I've learned to put my arm under my body, so I can avoid any other injury to my left arm.\"Lambru buys his prosthetics from the Alex Zanardi Foundation, a charity set up by the Italian racing driver who had both his legs amputated following a crash in 2001.Until he was 18, Lambru received the prostheses for free but now pays for one annually. He can't wear it for more than two days at a time otherwise it deteriorates. \"It's made of a lighter material than the ones I previously had,\" he explains. \"This is because I am now a professional and I need the full use of my arm to maintain balance.\"Before he made worldwide headlines on his professional debut, Lambru says his prosthetic arm went largely unnoticed in youth matches -- even by opposition players.\"I don't think there ever was any other case in Romania of a footballer playing with an arm prosthesis,\" he says. \"And I think no opponent ever knew that I was playing with a prosthesis. \"But I don't want to be protected because of this. I want to be treated just like everyone else and show my worth on the pitch.\"The futureFC Petrolul enjoyed success in the 1950s and 60s after relocating away from Bucharest, winning three of their four league titles in a nine-year period.In recent years, the club has continued to punch above its weight, winning both the Romanian Cup and Romanian Supercup as recently as 2013.However, in 2015, Petrolul's money problems culminated in bankruptcy and the club was dissolved a year later.But thanks to the determination of supporters and club legends, FC Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti was refounded in 2017 under the same name, albeit playing football in Romania's fourth tier.That's where Lambru comes in. Now an established member of the first-team squad, the 19-year-old hopes his goals can fire the team back to the top of Romanian football.With the club already achieving promotion in its first season, the signs of back-to-back promotions are promising after the first half of the 2017-18 league season. As the country's leagues return to playing after the winter break -- delayed by a week due to bad weather -- FC Petrolul sit top of the Liga III, undefeated after 13 matches.In the first match following the restart of the season, FC Petrolul beat Sporting Rosiori 1-0 to maintain their narrow lead at the top of the table, with Lambru coming on as a late substitute.A week later, the club hammered relegation-threatened FC Aninoasa 7-1, with Lambru scoring two goals to take his tally for the season to five.\"Firstly, I want to get as much playing time as I can at my club,\" he says level-headedly. \"To help them by playing well and by scoring goals. \"My aim is to finish at the top of our league, in order to be promoted to the second division. This is the most important thing for me.\"On a personal level, Lambru has aspirations of one day representing his country on the international stage. \"Of course I'm hoping to get to the first division in the shortest possible time and of course I am hoping to get to the national team,\" he says with determination. \"It's what every footballer dreams about, to wear the national team shirt and give everything for his country. The same goes for me.\"",

So you don't even know it's there.\"When tested by the the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the halo was found to prevent 17% of small objects aimed at the driver's head.Ricciardo, however, is keen to stress this added protection will not result in drivers taking more risks out on the track.\"As far as the approach to racing or the risks you take, zero changes,\" he insists. \"If we hit the wall, it doesn't make the wall feel any softer, it's really just to save a potential fatality with a flying object, a wheel or a wing from a car in front. \"If that's going to come towards us, then the halo is going to hopefully protect that.JUST WATCHEDMotorsports next Lewis Hamilton?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMotorsports next Lewis Hamilton? 02:56READ: Formula One to stop using \"grid girls\" for the 2018 seasonHome Grand PrixWith the season-opening Australian Grand Prix a little over one week away, Ricciardo's attention is focused on trying to secure a first podium finish at his home race.Since joining Red Bull in 2014, the 28-year-old has only managed a best of fourth place in 2016 -- and last year failed to even finish the race.Ricciardo openly admits strong starts to the season haven't been Red Bull's forte since he arrived, which he attributes to the team being better prepared for preseason testing in Barcelona. The one time Ricciardo did get a good start, finishing second at the 2014 season opener in Melbourne, he was subsequently disqualified after his car was found to have breached fuel regulations.That disqualification means an Australian is still to finish on the podium of the race since it became part of the F1 world championship in 1985.\"I'm quietly confident that we're going to start a lot stronger this season than we have in previous seasons,\" Ricciardo says. \"We've rolled the car out earlier this year, the team has been just a bit more proactive with getting the car prepared.

It will be the single biggest expulsion of Russian diplomats from Britain in more than 30 years, Prime Minister Theresa May announced Wednesday, as she set out a raft of measures intended to target Russian assets and strengthen UK defenses.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov says he expects UK diplomats to be expelled from Russia \"soon\".On Thursday, Lavrov accused May of grandstanding in her response to the incident, and said the Kremlin response would \"come very soon.\" Read More\"You understand that as polite people, we will first inform our British colleagues of the response. Unlike them, grabbing the microphone in order to accuse Russia of everything,\" Lavrov said.A spokesman for Vladimir Putin described the UK's accusations as \"unfounded\" and said \"it won't be long until\" the Russian President makes a decision on retaliatory measures. \"The offers will be considered by the Foreign Ministry, other institutions, but the main decision will be made by the President,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Thursday. \"There is no doubt he will choose the option that corresponds the most with the Russian national interests.\"JUST WATCHEDSalisbury resident's fear after nerve agent attackReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSalisbury resident's fear after nerve agent attack 02:24'Russia should shut up and go away'On Thursday, British Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson said Moscow had made a \"deliberate political decision\" to poison Skripal. He accused Russia of \"ripping up the international rulebook\" and \"attempting to \"subvert, undermine and influence\" countries around the world.\"Russia should shut up and go away,\" Williamson said. \"It's often described as a cool war that we are entering -- I would say it is feeling exceptionally chilly at the moment.\"The two governments have been locked in a war of words since Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were found slumped on a park bench in the English city of Salisbury on March 4. The pair are critically ill in the hospital after being exposed to a nerve agent known as Novichok that was developed in Russia, UK officials believe.May had given Moscow until midnight Tuesday to explain whether the attack was directed by Russian authorities or whether the government had lost control of the nerve agent. But the Kremlin, which has steadfastly denied the accusations, ignored the deadline and said Britain had not given it enough time to respond to May's request.  Britain's allies call out RussiaOn Thursday, the UK, US, Germany and France issued a joint statement insisting Russia was responsible for the attack and that \"there is no plausible alternative explanation.\"Haley slams Russia over spy poisoning in BritainThe four urged Russia to \"live up to its responsibilities as a member of the UN Security Council to uphold international peace and security.\"\"We call on Russia to address all questions related to the attack in Salisbury. Russia should in particular provide full and complete disclosure of the Novichok program to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW),\" the statement read.US President Donald Trump also weighed in Thursday, telling reporters: \"It certainly looks like the Russians were behind it. Something that should never, ever happen, and we are taking it very seriously, as I think are many others.\"\"I spoke with the Prime Minister and we are in deep discussions,\" he added. \"A very sad situation.\"Trump's comments followed those made by US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley on Wednesday, who blasted Russia and said the Trump administration stood in \"absolute solidarity with Great Britain,\" in the strongest US statement yet on the incident.\"If we don't take immediate concrete measures to address this now, Salisbury will not be the last place we see chemical weapons used,\" she said.On Thursday, May paid a visit to Salisbury to \"speak to people who responded to this terrible incident that took place,\" she said, and thank those who were \"continuing to work hard to investigate, to get to the bottom of those who are responsible, but also to ensure that the public are reassured.\"Rocky relationsSkripal was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2006 for spying for Britain, according to Russian state media accounts of the closed hearing.Russian court officials at the time said he'd received at least $100,000 for his work for MI6, the British intelligence service.

The Kremlin has always denied the accusation.Both countries have acknowledged the deterioration in sentiment, with Lavrov admitting in December it was \"not a secret\" that the Russia-UK relationship was at a \"very low point.\"Earlier Thursday, British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson accused Russia of having a \"smug, sarcastic response\" to the UK's calls for an explanation.Johnson also confirmed that the UK would submit a sample of the nerve agent to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for it to carry out its own tests.CNN's James Masters wrote from London.

His lawyer, Andrei Borovkov, confirmed his death to the Echo of Moscow radio station.In a statement, police said there was \"no evidence to suggest a link\" to the poisoning of the Russian former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury.Police were called by ambulance services at 10.46 p.m. Monday local time to an address in New Malden, in the borough of Kingston. A neighbor, Pat Egan, said police knocked on her door at 3.30 a.m. local time to ask whether she or her husband had seen or heard anything.Read MoreEgan said forensic crews attended the scene, but were not wearing hazmat suits. She added that police removed several bags of evidence. Tents were erected outside the house.Police activity at a residential address in southwest London, Tuesday March 13.Associations with oligarchsGlushkov was a friend of the oligarch Boris Berezovsky, a powerful oligarch found dead in his UK home in 2013. Glushkov was never convinced of the police explanation that Berezovsky killed himself. He was granted political asylum in the UK in 2010, and in February 2016 Britain refused a request from Russia to extradite him on fraud charges connected to a period in the 1990s when he was deputy director of the Russian national airline Aeroflot.Glushkov won notoriety in Russia's bare-knuckled transition to a market economy in the 1990s, when business, political and criminal interests often collided amid the privatization of state assets. He was formerly an employee of Berezovsky, one of the billionaires who bankrolled the 1996 re-election of President Boris Yeltsin. Berezovsky subsequently fell out with Yeltsin's successor, President Vladimir Putin, and Glushkov found himself caught up in a politically charged corruption case. Boris Berezovsky was found dead on the bathroom floor of his home in 2013.In 2000, Glushkov was arrested on charges of embezzling funds from Aeroflot, in which Berezovsky was a shareholder.Glushkov was sentenced in 2004 by the Savelovsky Court of Moscow to three years and three months in prison and released for time served, Russian news agency Tass reported.According to Tass, he received political asylum in the UK in 2010. But Russian courts continued to pursue him. Last year, a Moscow court tried him in absentia for embezzlement from Aeroflot.According to investigators, Glushkov conspired with Berezovsky to restructure and embezzle loans worth an estimated $122.5 million, the Russian court-reporting agency RAPSI reported. Acquaintances in LondonGlushkov was questioned as part of a British inquiry into the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned with highly radioactive polonium-210 in 2006 in a hotel bar in London. Glushkov told the inquiry that he bumped into Litvinenko in Berezovsky's office. Berezovsky was found dead in 2013 on the bathroom floor of his home in Berkshire, west of London. British police said at the time they found no sign of a struggle, suggesting Berezovsky had taken his own life. Glushkov  argued publicly that he believed the exiled tycoon had been murdered. Police said they had informed Glushkov's next of kin of his death. \"Whilst we believe we know the identity of the deceased, formal identification is yet to take place,\" the police statement said.CNN's James Masters wrote from London.

You are not welcome here,\" she said in a statement to the House of Commons following a meeting of Britain's National Security Council.JUST WATCHEDTheresa May: UK will expel 23 Russian diplomatsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTheresa May: UK will expel 23 Russian diplomats 01:08The expulsion of diplomats will \"fundamentally degrade Russian intelligence capability in the UK for years to come,\" May said. All planned high-level bilateral contacts will also be suspended, she said.Read MoreThe move comes after the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the southern English city of Salisbury on March 4. The Skripals are critically ill in the hospital after being exposed to a nerve agent, known as Novichok and developed in Russia. Thirty-six other people in Salisbury were seen by medics after the exposure. One, a police officer, remains hospitalized.May said Monday it was highly likely that Moscow was behind the poisoning. The Russian ambassador to the UK was summoned to the UK Foreign Office to explain whether the attack was directed by Russian authorities, or whether Moscow had lost control of the nerve agent.May demanded that the Kremlin respond by midnight Tuesday, London time, to the UK government's conclusion that Russia was linked to the poisoning of the Skripals. But Moscow -- which has repeatedly dismissed any accusations of involvement in the attack -- ignored the deadline.Following May's address, the Russian Embassy in London condemned the expulsion of its diplomats as a \"hostile action\" that is \"totally unacceptable, unjustified and short-sighted\" in a statement on its official website.\"All the responsibility for the deterioration of the Russia-UK relationship lies with the current political leadership of Britain,\" it said.The Russian Foreign Ministry condemned the UK move as \"an unprecedented gross provocation that undermines the foundations of a normal interstate dialogue between our countries.\"In a statement, it claimed the British government had \"made a choice in favor of confrontation with Russia\" rather than completing its own investigation, and said it considered the \"hostile measures\" announced by May to be \"categorically unacceptable and unworthy.\" The United Nations Security Council has called an emergency session at 3 p.m. ET to discuss the Salisbury attack.May: 'Full and robust response'Addressing lawmakers Wednesday, May said it had been right to give Russia the opportunity to answer the allegations.\"But their response has demonstrated complete disdain for the gravity of these events,\" she said. \"They have provided no credible explanation that could suggest they lost control of their nerve agent. No explanation as to how this agent came to be used in the United Kingdom; no explanation as to why Russia has an undeclared chemical weapons program in contravention of international law.\"Instead they have treated the use of a military-grade nerve agent in Europe with sarcasm, contempt and defiance.\" This leads to \"no alternative conclusion,\" May said, than that the Russian state was culpable for the attempted murder of the Skripals and for threatening the lives of other British citizens.Russian spy attack: Why Britain and why now?\"It must therefore be met with a full and robust response -- beyond the actions we have already taken since the murder of Mr. Litvinenko and to counter this pattern of Russian aggression elsewhere,\" she added, referring to another ex-Russian spy -- Alexander Litvinenko -- who was fatally poisoned in London in 2006.May said she would propose new legislative powers to strengthen Britain's defenses against hostile state activity and target those responsible for human-rights abuses through sanctions.Britain will also step up its efforts to monitor those traveling to the UK who may pose a security threat, she said, and crack down on \"corrupt elites.\" She also announced plans to freeze Russian state assets \"wherever we have the evidence that they may be used to threaten the life or property of UK nationals or residents,\" she said.Military personnel wearing protective suits remove a police car and other vehicles from a public parking lot in Salisbury on Sunday.As part of the suspension of high-level contacts, no UK ministers or royals will attend the soccer World Cup in Russia this summer and the UK has revoked an invitation to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to visit Britain, May said. The Prime Minister stressed that she had the support of international partners, including NATO and the European Union. She also insisted that she did not blame the Russian people for events in Salisbury, pointing instead toward Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"Many of us looked at a post-Soviet Russia with hope. We wanted a better relationship and it is tragic that President Putin has chosen to act in this way,\" she said. \"But we will not tolerate the threat to life of British people and others on British soil from the Russian Government. Nor will we tolerate such a flagrant breach of Russia's international obligations.\" NATO on Wednesday expressed \"deep concern \" over the Salisbury incident, saying that it was \"the first offensive use of a nerve agent on alliance territory since NATO's foundation.\" It urged Russia to address Britain's questions, including \"providing full and complete disclosure\" of the Novichok program to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the body that implements the Chemical Weapons Convention.Kremlin: 'Unfounded accusations'Speaking in Moscow earlier Wednesday, Lavrov accused UK authorities of \"political theater\" and trying to mislead the international community rather than submitting an official request to Russia in accordance with the Chemical Weapons Convention. Russia is ready to respond to an official request within 10 days, in line with its obligations, once it is made, Lavrov said.Former Soviet chemist shares details of the nerve agent Novichok Lavrov also said that Russia had no motive in targeting the specific individuals concerned and that all allegations were based on speculation. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov similarly rejected \"unfounded accusations\" of Russian involvement in the attack as he spoke with reporters on a conference call. He urged other countries to use their \"common sense\" as they consider whether there is any proof to the claims.Skripal is believed to have lived in the UK since his release from Russian custody in 2010.He was convicted in Russia of spying for Britain before he was granted asylum in the UK after a high-profile spy swap in 2010 between the US and Russia.Since then, a number of Russians have been attacked or died in the United Kingdom. The latest is Nikolai Glushkov, a Russian exile who was found dead in his London home on Monday night. Glushkov had links to compatriots who died in unexplained circumstances in the UK, but police said there was no evidence to suggest a link between Glushkov's death and Skripal's poisoning.CNN's Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London and Joshua Berlinger wrote from Hong Kong.

        "content": "(CNN)On Wednesday, Angela Merkel will begin a historic fourth term as Chancellor of Germany, making her one of the longest-serving leaders in modern German history.Merkel, who grew up in East Germany, entered parliament in 1990 as the Soviet Empire crumbled, rising quickly through the ranks in the newly unified German government led by the late Helmut Kohl. But Kohl's \"M\u00e4dchen\" (or \"girl\") would ultimately seal his political fate, writing a newspaper column in 1999 in which she criticized his leadership and urged the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) to move ahead without him. A younger Angela Merkel and then German Chancellor Helmut Kohl at a party convention in Dresden in 1991.She became leader of the party the following year -- and Chancellor five years later. Twelve years on -- and despite a poor election result in September that left Merkel scrambling to form a government -- she is still standing, unlike many of the leaders who stepped into the spotlight beside her.Take a look at who -- and what -- Merkel has outlasted since she first came to power.Read MorePoliticsTwenty-nine leaders of G20 countries have come and gone since Merkel took office, including six Japanese and five Italian prime ministers.Merkel is seen here at the G8 Summit in Huntsville, Ontario in 2010, with Barack Obama, Nicolas Sarkozy, David Cameron, Dmitry Medvedev and Stephan Harper - all of whom have come and gone during her tenure.The list also includes US President Barack Obama, French Presidents Nicolas Sarkozy and Francois Hollande, and British Prime Ministers Gordon Brown and David Cameron.And the world has been far from conflict-free during Merkel's reign. We've seen the Arab Spring, civil war in Libya, revolutions in Egypt, Tunisia and Ukraine and war between Russia and Georgia. We've seen the growth of ISIS and the terror group's capture -- and loss -- of huge swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq. [Crises Three years into her first term, Merkel faced the world's worst financial crisis since the Great Depression -- and helped steer Germany to economic recovery.Fast forward a few years and Europe was embroiled in its own debt crisis that almost saw Greece leave the Eurozone and caused unemployment to skyrocket in Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece too.Many Germans disapproved of the way Merkel handled the crisis, while the view from abroad -- Greece excepted -- was more positive. Merkel has been at the center of Europe's response to the so-called refugee crisis. Hard on the heels of that emergency came the so-called refugee crisis, which saw around 1.5 million people arrive in Europe by sea. Many of them ended up in Germany.And since 2005, several deadly epidemics have swept the globe, from the H1N1 influenza virus (or \"swine flu\") in 2009 to outbreaks of Ebola and Zika.TechWhen Merkel first went into politics, the iPhone was a thing of the future.Twelve models of the ubiquitous smartphone have since passed by -- along with eight different (mostly feline-related) Mac operating systems, including Leopard, Mountain Lion and Yosemite. We've also seen the rise -- and fall -- of countless gadgets, including Google Glass, Google's ill-conceived instant messaging system (\"Google Wave\"), and the Twitter Peek, a not-so-popular handheld tweeting device.The combustible Samsung Galaxy Note 7 has come and gone -- as has the equally flammable hoverboard. NASA's New Horizons spacecraft was launched in 2006 and reached Pluto in 2015. Space travel has seen more success -- the space probe New Horizons was launched just a few months after Merkel became Chancellor and traveled three billion miles to reach Pluto in 2015.Sport\"Usain who?\" Few people had heard of the Jamaican sprinter in 2005. Bolt has since become an athletics legend -- and headed gracefully into retirement -- all within the span of Merkel's years at the top.Jamaica's Usain Bolt shot to fame in Merkel's first term and retired from athletics in 2017.Europe's top football clubs have seen multiple handovers at the top since 2005 -- Bayern Munich has had five different managers and Spanish rivals Real Madrid eight. And the world of sport has been rocked by several doping scandals, which have seen the former stars Lance Armstrong, Tyson Gay and Maria Sharapova fall from grace.EntertainmentMerkel's tenure has spanned countless viral video sensations -- from a baby biting his brother's finger to Psy's Gangnam Style.\"Gangnam Style\" by South Korean rapper Park Jae Sang went viral in 2012.We've had the ice bucket and mannequin challenges, and seen the rise and fall of British boyband One Direction.Some of the most famous TV series of all time hadn't yet hit our screens in 2005 -- and have since aired their final shows -- from Breaking Bad and True Blood to Downton Abbey.And countless Hollywood couples have put their signatures to both marriage and divorce certificates during the years that Merkel has been leader -- Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise, and Chris Pratt and Anna Faris, to name just two.",

Can racing still be exciting without human drivers? 2016-17 Formula E champion and Roborace CEO, Lucas di Grassi, seems to think so.He says like electric-powered race cars, people will come around to the idea.\"People laughed but people are slowly turning to the idea,\" he told CNN Supercharged. \"We are in a very, very important transitional process of motorsport.\"JUST WATCHEDThe Gen2: Formula E's F22-inspired race carReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe Gen2: Formula E's F22-inspired race car 00:55Read More'Motorsport is losing relevancy'Roborace has been working on driverless cars and creating a new autonomous driving championship for a few years now.

        "content": "(CNN)Angela Merkel was sworn in as Chancellor of Germany after lawmakers voted to re-elect her as leader in a close vote on Wednesday morning. She will now begin a historic fourth term as Chancellor.The vote in parliament ended almost six months of political turmoil after a federal election saw millions of voters desert the two mainstream parties -- Merkel's Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party (SPD) -- turning instead to parties on the left and right. At 171 days, it is by far the longest period in modern German history between a federal election and the election of a Chancellor.In a secret ballot, 364 of the Bundestag's 709 members voted in favor of Merkel -- nine more than the 50% required. Thirty-five MPs from the parties governing under Merkel did not vote to re-elect her. Read MoreSpeaking on Monday in expectation of her re-election, Merkel said: \"I think everyone has the feeling it's time to finally start working. A new departure for Europe, a new dynamic for Germany, new cohesion for our country -- that's what we have before us... So there is a lot of work ahead.\"Angela Merkel set for fourth term after months of political deadlock Merkel's victory marks the final stepping stone on the path to Germany's new government -- a renewal of the so-called grand coalition (\"GroKo\") between the Chancellor's CDU/Christian Social Union alliance and the SPD.The former leader of the SPD, Martin Schulz, had initially ruled out a new GroKo, pledging to take his party into opposition, but was forced to change his stance after coalition talks between the CDU, Green Party and liberal Free Democratic Party collapsed in November, raising the possibility of new elections. After weeks of negotiations, a coalition treaty was produced and later approved by SPD members who voted via postal ballot. But many SPD members and politicians remain unhappy with their party's involvement in the new coalition. Government must 'win back lost trust'In a speech nominating Merkel as Chancellor on Wednesday morning, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier warned that the new coalition must win back the trust of voters and protect Germany's liberal democracy, alluding to the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) without mentioning the party by name.\"In order to win back lost trust, a simple restoration of old ways will not suffice. This government has to prove itself in new and different ways.\"\"The liberal democracies of the West are beset with challenges -- from without as well as from within,\" he said. \"Even in parts of Europe elections are being won with isolationism, nationalism and an unwillingness to compromise.\"Chancellor Angela Merkel with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier WednesdayHe urged Germany to set an example to the world by remaining democratic, outward-looking and peaceful, adding that the country is in a better position than many others to prove the value of liberal democracy. \"We have proven in the past that we can free ourselves from the most difficult situations with courage and determination,\" he said.First day on the job: Meet Germany's new far-right politiciansThe renewal of the grand coalition means the AfD is now officially the lead opposition party in parliament.Founded in 2013, the party ran on a virulently anti-immigration platform that proved popular with voters in the September election.The party surged into third place in the election with 12.6% of the vote, the first time in decades that a far-right, openly nationalist party had won seats in Germany's federal parliament.AfD politicians have campaigned strongly against Merkel and her policies. Following the election result in September, co-leader Alexander Gauland promised his party would provide staunch opposition to the new government, adding: \"We will hunt them. We will hunt Mrs. Merkel or whomever. And we will take back our country and our people.\"Gauland reaffirmed his commitment to that promise Wednesday and pledged to \"fiercely criticize\" the government's proposals.Protest was evident even as Merkel was being re-elected and sworn in. As she was taking her oath, a protester in the parliament's public gallery held up a poster reading \"Merkel must go,\" a phrase popularized by the AfD. AfD lawmaker Petr Bystron was also fined \u20ac1,000 ($1,240) for posting a picture of his ballot paper on Twitter with the comment \"not my Chancellor.\"Refugees and EU reform at top of coalition agendaPriorities for the new government will include new policies on refugees and European Union reforms. The new government wants to cap the number of asylum seekers taken in each year by Germany at 180,000 to 200,000 and reinstate the right of refugees with temporary protection status to bring their families to Germany, limiting the number of new arrivals via that route to 1,000 per month.'We can't just stop breathing': A global scandal, made in GermanyThe coalition has also pledged to work toward a Europe that can act independently and effectively on the global stage, while also strengthening European ties with the United States.Regarding weapons exports, the parties have pledged to no longer approve exports to countries involved in the war in Yemen in what will be seen as a victory for German activists against the arms trade.Closer to home, the new government is promising not to raise taxes, to build 1.5 million new homes and to avoid bans on diesel cars in Germany's cities following the Volkswagen \"Dieselgate\" scandal.CNN's Nadine Schmidt contributed to this report",

        "content": "(CNN)Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to win the March 18 election by a wide margin, but that doesn't mean Russians are happy with the way things are.Restrictions on political freedoms have prevented any real opposition from running against Putin, and years of economic troubles have hit everyday Russians hard.But is life in the United States any better? Here's how the two countries compare......if you want to be happy     Americans are significantly happier than Russians, according to the UN's World Happiness Report 2018. Looking at indicators such as income, life expectancy, freedom to make decisions and social support, the US ranked 18th of 156 countries, while Russia was 59th.Read MoreBut that gap is closing. Another index in the report measuring changes in happiness levels in 141 countries showed that Russians became happier from the period 2008-10 to 2015-17.The US, however, was among 72 countries that became less happy in that time. This loss of happiness was mostly due to non-income factors, including less social support and a reduced sense of personal freedoms, the report suggests. ...if you want to save up     Prices are generally much lower in Russia than in the US, but Russia wages are lower too. When purchasing power parity -- a measure of affordability -- is taken into account, Americans can buy more with their bucks than Russians can with their rubles.Renting a home and lifestyle expenses, like going out for dinner or buying a bottle of wine, are much more affordable for Americans. Of course, there are some things, such as catching a cab, that are cheaper for Russians....if you're a woman     The gender gap in the US isn't that different to Russia's when it comes to the number of women in the workforce and education levels. But a World Economic Forum study of gender equality around the world ranked the US well above Russia for one main reason -- political empowerment. American women play a greater role in governance overall than women in Russia, although Russia has more women in ministerial positions. Neither country has had a female head of state in modern history.Russia has no laws specifically addressing domestic violence, and in February 2017, the country introduced legislation dubbed the \"slapping law,\" which actually decriminalized many forms of violence in the home....if you like vacations     Paid vacation is enshrined in law in Russia, and everyone in the country is entitled to at least 14 paid national holidays as well. If these holidays fall on a day like Tuesday, Russians will often get the Monday off as a \"bridge\" day, as well.The US is the only developed nation in the world that doesn't guarantee paid time off work. Americans in salaried professions, however, generally expect employers to offer paid vacation time and public holidays as well. But a lot of Russians don't take the leave they're given -- many say they can't afford to go away. It's also because Russians often rely on financial extras, like overtime, so while they may get their wages to take time off, they give up other benefits if they do....if you get sick     It can be difficult to quantify the quality and accessibility of healthcare. Russia, for example, offers universal healthcare to its citizens, meaning the government pays for people to see a doctor or get treatment, and it has more hospital beds and physicians available per person. But the quality of healthcare is so low that many Russians end up paying out of their pockets for treatment.The US spends a much larger portion of its GDP on health, but it generally only funds or subsidizes healthcare for eligible lower-income people and their families, disabled people and senior citizens, so most Americans rely on private insurance. But a study published in The Lancet ranking the world's healthcare systems by quality and accessibility put the US at 34th of 195 countries, while Russia came in at a much lower 72nd. ...if you want to have a baby     Paid maternity and paternity leave is another area where the US lags behind the rest of the developed world. By law, new parents working for companies of a certain size for at least a year are given time off after having a baby or adopting a child, but there's no national requirement to pay them or hold their job beyond a few months. Some states, like California, are beginning to offer more generous terms. In Russia, the leave entitlement is generous, but the pay is capped at a basic wage. Women get 70 paid days before and 70 days after birth or adoption. Some women, however, report discrimination and job insecurity when they do return to work.There is no explicit paternity leave, but men can take annual paid leave and employers are obliged to offer all parents up to three years off or flexible working time after having a child. One parent can stay at home at a time at a maximum pay of 21,555 rubles ($377) a month in that three-year period....if you're gay or a lesbian     The acceptance of homosexuality in Russia is strikingly low and homophobia has crept into government policy in recent years. The country in 2013 passed a law that became known as the gay propaganda law, making the distribution of materials that show \"non-traditional sexual relationships\" to minors illegal.Reports emerged around a year ago that authorities in Russia's Chechen Republic were detaining and abusing gay men because of their sexuality. The Chechen government denied the accusations and also denied gay men even exist in the republic.In the US, on the other hand, gay rights have improved. A 2015 Supreme Court ruling paved the way for same-sex marriage to become legal in all 50 states and another Supreme Court decision in 2016 made same-sex adoption legal across the country as well....if you want to feel safe     Crime rates in the US are much higher than in Russia -- except when it comes to murder. Russia has more than twice the number of intentional homicides than the US, but Americans are over five times more likely to be burgled and over 14 times more likely to be assaulted, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime.

        "content": "Salisbury, England (CNN)Welcome to the city of Salisbury, where local market traders sell fresh organic vegetables, amid nervous talk of chemical weapons, and men in protective suits and gas masks walk in and out of the local pub. It wasn't always like this, of course. But in the wake of the attempted murder last week of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, life in this city of 45,000 has taken on a surreal, and some say uncomfortable edge.  For Danny Styles, a fruit and vegetable seller, whose stall is located just steps from where the Skripals were found poisoned by a military-grade nerve agent, the prospect of unknowingly coming into contact with the substance has left him with a feeling of powerlessness. \"I think the fact a nerve agent was used is scaring people,\" Styles says, between bagging up groceries. \"No one can really do much about it. If you do end up consuming it [the nerve agent], people are concerned they could be at risk of dying.\"Danny Styles, outside his market stall in the center of Salisbury. Read MoreLethal nerve agentThat risk was made all the more apparent with the declaration late last week, that hundreds of local people could be affected, after traces of the nerve agent -- since identified as the highly lethal Novichok -- were detected in the Salisbury branch of Italian restaurant Zizzi and the popular Mill pub. Military personnel in protective suits remove a police car and other vehicles from a public park park as they investigate the poisoning of Sergei Skripal on March 11 in Salisbury, England. So far, any serious ill-effects appear limited to those who directly encountered the substance, including first responder Detective Sgt. Nick Bailey, who remains hospitalized in serious condition. Skripal, and his daughter Yulia, also remain hospitalized in critical condition.However, on Friday, an additional 180 specialist military personnel were deployed to the city to help police investigate and prevent further potential contamination.This was followed by the removal of the restaurant table where the pair ate on the day of attack for examination. Restaurant employees and diners were also advised to wash their clothes.For local resident Geoffrey Bennetts the government's latest advice is a case of too little, too late. \"We're not getting much information,\" says Bennetts. \"How can you ask people to wash their clothes a week after. They probably don't remember what they even wore. Its extraordinary.\"JUST WATCHEDWhat is Novichok and how does it kill?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhat is Novichok and how does it kill? 01:34Life goes onBut despite the obvious changes to their city, residents continue to go about their daily lives as best they can.Matthew Dean, leader of the city's local council, said people viewed the arrival of additional military personnel with a mix of nonchalance and trepidation. \"There has been a nervousness about the large police and armed force presence, but Salisbury is very resilient,\" said Dean. \"We're fortunate that we are home to British Army so we are used to seeing armed forces going about their business.\"A Salisbury shop is closed for business as a result of the ongoing police investigation.Even before the attack, the UK's Ministry of Defense was an ever present part of life in the city, with tanks and troop carriers thundering back and forth across nearby Salisbury Plain, one of the country's largest and oldest military training sites. Salisbury is also close to the world renowned Porton Down chemical weapons laboratory, a military research facility that specializes in testing chemicals used in war. There, experts are currently looking at samples of the substance that poisoned Skripal and his daughter. At a women's 70-plus fitness class, local resident Judy Stefford says she has lived through harder times, but chemical weapons and secret agents are far from what she expects in her hometown. \"Nobody thinks anything happens in Salisbury. It's just a little urban place isn't it really.\"That may change after UK Prime Minister Theresa May linked the attack to Russia Monday. On Tuesday, she announced the UK would expel 23 Russian diplomats and suspend high-level contacts between the two countries in the wake of the incident. According to May, the attack put the city's residents in harms way and may amount to an \"unlawful use of force\" on the city.Investigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury.Support ongoingBack at the market, Styles says the incident is beginning to impact the market \"massively\" due to a drop in footfall. The city, says Styles, has gone eerily quiet. \"We are struggling badly, we've hardly got any customers or people walking through here let alone buying stuff.\"A police line warns resident against  entering into an area of ongoing investigation. Opposite the restaurant where the Skripals are believed to have eaten on the day of the attack, coffee shop owner Lydia Williams confirms that local residents are choosing to stay away from the city center.\"I think locals don't want to walk around, as it is so busy with so much activity from authorities,\" says Williams, who admits her own business has yet to be affected thanks in part to the sudden arrival of the international press. For Salisbury native and tour guide Lorna Matthews-Keel recent developments are just another part of the medieval city's long and colorful history. \"I think we're aware that a profound thing has happened. But I also think we're aware that history is in the making all the time,\" she says, pointing to the fact that Salisbury is home to one of four remaining copies of the original Magna Carta. \"We will now always in our history be connected to a Russian spy,\" said Matthews-Keel.

        "content": "(CNN)US President Donald Trump suggested on Tuesday that he believes the British government's theory that Russia was likely responsible for the nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter in England earlier this month.\"It sounds to me like it would be Russia, based on all the evidence they have,\" Trump told reporters outside the White House. \"It sounds to me like they believe it was Russia and I would certainly take that finding as fact.\"Trump added: \"As soon as we get the facts straight, if we agree with them, we will condemn Russia or whoever it may be.\"  Trump also said he would speak to UK Prime Minister Theresa May about the incident. 'Highly likely' Russia poisoned former spy, UK's Prime Minister saysMay said Monday that it was \"highly likely\" Russia was to blame for the attack, and demanded an explanation from Moscow by midnight Tuesday for how a \"military-grade\" nerve agent was used in the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33.Read MoreUK authorities believe the pair were targeted with Novichok, a nerve agent developed in the Soviet Union in the 1970s. The Skripals were found slumped on a bench in the English city of Salisbury on March 4, and remain in critical condition.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed accusations of Russian involvement as \"nonsense,\" state-run Tass reported. His office said Moscow would not respond to London's ultimatum without receiving a sample of the substance.Also Tuesday, Russia's ambassador to the European Union told CNN that Britain might not be \"such a safe place\" for Russian nationals. Vladimir Chizhov also said the British government had \"failed to provide Russia with detailed evidence and samples,\" which Chizhov said his country would need to \"launch an investigation by our own experts.\"Trump's remarks to reporters came on the heels of the news that he had fired US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Former US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Monday he was \"outraged\" that Russia appeared to have engaged in \"the attempted murder of a private citizen on the soil of a sovereign nation.\"On Monday, Tillerson issued a harsh condemnation of Russia over the poisoning of Skripal. Tillerson's remarks went further than the White House's response earlier in the day, which had stopped short of pinning blame for the attack on Moscow.Trump and Tillerson are not the only foreign figures to lend their support to the UK. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel have condemned the attack, while NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the UK is a \"highly valued ally\" and the incident is of \"great concern\" to NATO.Federica Mogherini, the EU's high representative for foreign affairs, described the attack as shocking and said the EU stands \"with the UK in pursuit of justice.\"Moscow: Threats of sanctions 'will not remain unanswered'May said Monday that the Russian ambassador had been summoned to the UK Foreign Office to explain whether the attack was \"a direct action by the Russian state,\" or the result of the Russian government \"losing control\" of its stock nerve agents.Her combative stance was echoed by UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who described the incident as \"a brazen attempt to murder innocent people.\"\"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of nerve agent on the continent of Europe since the Second World War and we want the Russians to give an account of what's been going on,\" Johnson said.\"If they can't, then clearly the UK government will come forward with measures, a response that is commensurate but robust.\"Sergei Skripal and daughter Yulia remain hospitalized in critical condition.Exactly how Britain might respond to evidence that implicated Moscow in the attack remains unclear. Possible options might include the expulsion of Russian diplomats and UK-based pro-Kremlin oligarchs, financial restrictions on figures linked to the Kremlin, and diplomatic efforts involving EU and US allies.After mounting speculation that UK regulators could clamp down on broadcaster Russia Today, the company said it was \"regrettable to see RT so quickly proposed to be sacrificed as a political pawn\" and that \"any curtailment of RT will ultimately be to the detriment of the British public.\" The UK's National Security Council is scheduled to meet Wednesday to review any Russian response to May's speech.On Tuesday, Lavrov accused the UK of denying a request from Russia to access the case materials, including samples of the substance used.Poisoning of Russian spy raises troubling questions\"In response to this absolutely lawful and logical request ... we received an unclear response, which can be summarized that these lawful requests were denied,\" Lavrov said.The UK Foreign Office said it could not confirm whether such a request had been submitted.In a statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry confirmed that Moscow would \"not respond to London's ultimatum\" until provided with samples of the substance.It continued by saying \"any threats of taking 'sanctions' measures against the Russian Federation will not remain unanswered. This must be understood by the British side.\"In other developments, UK Ambassador to Russia Laurie Bristow was summoned to Moscow, according to a spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry.Investigation will last 'many weeks'Skripal is believed to have lived in the UK since his release from Russian custody in 2010.He was convicted in Russia of spying for Britain before he was granted refuge in the UK after a high-profile spy swap in 2010 between the United States and Russia.Since he and his daughter were hospitalized on March 4, the usually quiet city of Salisbury, best known for its proximity to Stonehenge, has been a hub of activity.About 180 military personnel were deployed to the city on Friday to help police amid concerns over potential contamination.People who visited the Bishop's Mill pub and a branch of the Zizzi restaurant chain on the day of the incident are being urged to wash their clothes, and the two sites -- both visited by Skripal and Yulia on March 4, according to the Metropolitan Police -- remain cordoned off.Police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Sergei Skripal in Wiltshire, England. Neil Basu, assistant crime commissioner for counterterrorism, said 38 people had received medical attention because of possible exposure to the nerve agent. Three of those remained hospitalized -- the Skripals and police officer Nick Bailey -- with one other person being monitored as an outpatient.Basu also offered new details on the timeline of the incident, revealing that Yulia arrived in London on a flight from Moscow on March 3 and traveled with her father to Salisbury city center in a red BMW the next day, arriving around 1:40 p.m. They visited the pub and the restaurant before being found by police slumped on a bench near Zizzi soon after 4:15 p.m.Basu said the investigation was complex and could last \"many weeks,\" adding: \"We will follow where the evidence leads.\"Intelligence agency investigating 'suspicious' deathsMeanwhile, UK Home Secretary Amber Rudd has asked police and intelligence agency MI5 to look into allegations of Russian state involvement in a number of deaths in the UK.After the Salisbury incident, the chairwoman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, Yvette Cooper, wrote to the home secretary regarding a Buzzfeed report alleging Russian links to 14 suspicious deaths in the UK. Cooper asked for a review of such cases. On Tuesday, Rudd wrote back to Cooper, stating, \"I will want to satisfy myself that the allegations are nothing more than that. The police and MI5 agree and will assist in that endeavour.\"CNN's Seb Shukla and Hilary McGann contributed to this report.",

Mueller was given his Bundesliga debut a month shy of his 19th birthday by German coach Jurgen Klinsmann, but says he barely has any memory of that day as he \"only played 10 minutes.\"The early memory he cherishes more than any other is his first goal for Bayern, which came in the 7-1 demolition of Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League.Thomas Mueller lifted the Champions League with Bayern Munich in 2013.Demonstrating the \"Raumdeuter\"' qualities that would later go on to define him, Mueller somehow found space, just two yards from goal, in a crowded box of 15 players.He tapped the ball into the empty net, just 20 minutes after coming on, to complete the rout of the Portuguese side.\"It was obviously pure euphoria,\" he says. \"You don't forget that any time soon.\"Bayern Munich go into Wednesday's second leg of their Champions League round of 16 clash against Besiktas with an insurmountable 5-0 advantage.Mueller, who scored one goal and assisted another in the first leg demolition in Munich, is chasing his second European Cup.But with multiple Bundesliga titles and Champions League and World Cup winners' medals around his neck, his status as a legend of German football is already confirmed. Mueller now looks to impart some of his wisdom on the next generation of Bayern players.\"With this business, when you look at the academy, the pressure on the young players in pretty big,\" he says. \"\"You want to be a role model to them because everybody who lives here at the academy, plays and trains here, is someone special and has a big chance to make it to the top. \"For FC Bayern, it's very important that in the future that players from their own youth academy are able to climb the ladder.\"",

Colin Firth and Rachel Weisz star in Hollywood blockbuster \"The Mercy\" -- currently out in cinemas -- directed by Academy Award winning director James Marsh.

Nine sailors undertook the challenge, an epic journey across some of the most treacherous waters on the planet that had only been completed by about 200 people before the start of this year. Donald Crowhurst was the man who inspired a pair of movies about his life. The reward -- roughly $120,000 in today's money -- for the Golden Globe Race also caught the eye of UK Royal Air Force veteran Donald Crowhurst, a married father-of-four who was struggling to make ends meet running a failing electronics company in Bridgwater, southwest England. READ: The man who sailed around the world in 42 daysPot of GoldBorn in British colonial India in 1932, Crowhurst had limited sailing experience. He mostly took his family on trips on his own small boat, ironically named Pot of Gold, just off the British coast.Donald Crowhurst's boat, the Teignmouth Electron, is hoisted onto another vessel after being found. Nonetheless, Crowhurst managed to persuade a local businessman, Stanley Best, to pay for the building of his trimaran at a Norfolk boatyard. But caravan dealer Best, who was also backing Crowhurst's near-bankrupt electronics business, had one demand -- he would have to buy back the boat if his trip failed. In other words, Crowhurst would go bust unless he pulled off the seemingly impossible task.In order to meet the October 31 deadline to enter the race, the trimaran was put together in a rush, meaning Crowhurst set off on an a boat that wasn't seaworthy. \"We were watching from the shore. I don't think any of us quite knew what was going to happen next,\" Crowhurst's son, Simon, told The Guardian in an interview in 2009. In the late 1960s, there was no GPS, no internet and no modern communication equipment. Instead, long-distance sailing was done by relying on the position of stars and use of sextants.JUST WATCHEDThe Volvo Ocean Race in AustraliaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe Volvo Ocean Race in Australia 22:32By July 1969, some 240 days after he set off from the British coast, Crowhurst's yacht, the Teignmouth Electron, was found drifting in the middle of the Atlantic with its captain nowhere to be found.\"I don't think that my father realized how badly things could go wrong,\" Simon said.Hoax?What happened between the start of his journey and the end is still shrouded in mystery.Was it all a hoax?

Hallworth made the British public believe underdog Crowhurst was in fact winning the race.

It quickly ran into trouble, with the C-Star being held up in Egypt and Cyprus and its crew accused of people smuggling. They were later released for lack of evidence.In August, a boat belonging to organization Sea-Eye, a charity that rescues migrants, was called upon to help the C-Star after it suffered a mechanical failure.",

The Hannover public prosecutor's office said it had been informed of Groening's death by his lawyer.Groening was found guilty of being an accessory to the murder of 300,000 people at the Auschwitz death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland during World War II.He was accused of counting the cash found in the belongings of new arrivals at the camp and sending it to Nazi headquarters in Berlin.Read MoreAt least 1.1 million people were killed in the camps at Auschwitz, the vast majority of them Jewish victims of the Nazi genocide, but also Poles, gay people, disabled people and other persecuted minorities.About six million Jewish people died in Nazi concentration camps during the war.

Groening, who's in his 90s, was found guilty by a court in Lueneburg, Germany, of being an accessory to the murder of 300,000 people at the Auschwitz death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland during World War II.

In the end, a German court found him guilty of assisting in mass murder as a guard at the Nazi-run Sobibor death camp in German-occupied Poland. He was sentenced to five years in prison, and died in 2012 in a home for the elderly where he was living pending appeal.Hide Caption 2 of 11 Photos: Nazi war criminals: Justice done?Perhaps the most famous Nazi war crimes trial was that of Adolf Eichmann, who was hiding in Argentina when he was seized by Israeli agents. He was brought to Jerusalem and tried in a protective glass booth flanked by Israeli police. Responsible for helping to organize the deportation of about 1.5 million Jews to concentration camps, Eichmann was found guilty of crimes against the Jewish people. He was hanged in 1962.Hide Caption 3 of 11 Photos: Nazi war criminals: Justice done?Trials of major war criminals, including the upper echelon of surviving Nazi officials, took place in Nuremberg, Germany, on the heels of World War II. The Nuremberg Trials resulted in 12 death sentences, three life imprisonments, four shorter prison terms and three acquittals. Among those sentenced to death at Nuremberg was Hans Frank, former governor general of occupied Poland. Frank was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity. He was executed by hanging in 1946.Hide Caption 4 of 11 Photos: Nazi war criminals: Justice done?Hermann Goering was the highest-ranking Nazi tried at Nuremberg.

He went on to write two autobiographical books, \"Inside the Third Reich\" and \"Spandau: The Secret Diaries.\"Hide Caption 9 of 11 Photos: Nazi war criminals: Justice done?Ilse Koch was the wife of Buchenwald camp commander Karl Koch.

Genzken was found guilty of experimenting on people using poisons and incendiary bombs and was sentenced to life in prison. Other doctors, such as the notorious Josef Mengele, committed inhumane medical experiments on Auschwitz prisoners. Mengele was never caught or tried.Hide Caption 11 of 11For many years after the war, Groening worked as an accountant in a factory and suppressed what he had witnessed and participated in at Auschwitz. But in the mid 1980s he finally came forward to say he had seen the mass killings in response to claims by Holocaust deniers.This admission opened him up to public attention and scrutiny -- and ultimately prosecution.During his trial, Groening admitted that he was \"morally complicit\" in the crimes but denied that he was legally guilty.Groening insisted in a 2005 interview with Der Spiegel that he had been no more than a \"cog in the gears\".His first plea for clemency was denied by German prosecutors a day after it was made public, but he never served the sentence due to a raft of further appeals. His latest appeal was denied in January.The legal doctrine under which Nazis can be tried in Germany began to evolve with the conviction in 2011 of another convicted Nazi war criminal, John Demjanjuk, as an accessory to the murder of 28,000 Jews in the Sobibor death camp in Poland.Groening's conviction extended the doctrine further, opening a door to further trials of alleged Nazi criminals.In 2016, Reinhold Hanning, a former SS guard at Auschwitz, was convicted of having assisted in the deaths of 170,000 people and sentenced to five years in prison.The trial of Hubert Zafke -- then 95 and accused of being an accessory to at least 3,681 murders at the same camp -- also began in 2016, but ended in September last year after he was deemed no longer fit to stand trial due to dementia, according to Reuters.In statement posted online, Dr Efraim Zuroff, chief Nazi-hunter at the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Holocaust research group, said Groning's death just before he was due to serve his sentence was \"unfortunate, at least on a symbolic level.\"\"Without at least symbolic justice, these trials -- as important as they are -- lose an important part of their significance,\" he said.\"Their victims never had any appeals, nor did their tormentors have any mercy. Consequently these perpetrators don't deserve either.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Britain's National Security Council met Monday to discuss the latest intelligence on the attempted murder of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, as pressure mounts on UK Prime Minister Theresa May over the alleged involvement of Moscow in the attack.Multiple UK media reports suggested that the government is close to finalizing a number of retaliatory measures, including diplomatic expulsions and sanctions, should a Russian link be formally established. Such a development would plunge relations between the UK and Russia to their lowest ebb since the end of the Cold War.Speaking from Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday the UK should \"get to the bottom\" of what happened to the former spy in the English city of Salisbury before talking to him, according to the state-run RIA news agency.Putin was replying to a BBC journalist, who asked if Russia was responsible for attacking Skripal and his daughter with a nerve agent.Read MoreAccording to RIA, he replied: \"Get to the bottom of [things] there, and then we will discuss this with you\".The Skripals, believed by authorities to have been deliberately targeted, were found slumped on a bench near a shopping center in Salisbury eight days ago. Police say a nerve agent was used in the attack.Sergei Skripal Yulia SkripalOn Monday, the Chair of the UK's Foreign Affairs Committee, Tom Tugendhat, said the attack was \"looking awfully like it was state-sponsored attempted murder.\"Speaking to BBC Radio, Tugendhat said he was expecting the Prime Minister to make an announcement soon. \"And frankly, I'd be surprised if she did not point the finger at the Kremlin.\"Tugendhat, who is a member of the governing Conservative party, said the UK would need to introduce firm measures in the event of such an announcement. \"The key with responding to Russia is making sure we make Putin realize what we're doing, and make people who support him realize that supporting him isn't a great idea,\" said Tugendhat. \"And that, to be honest, doesn't mean general sanctions. That means very specific sanctions.\" Tugendhat's comments follow those of UK Chancellor, Philip Hammond, who on Sunday indicated the government could move to support the introduction of US-style \"Magnitsky Act\" sanctions legislation on Russian officials, should sufficient evidence be provided linking Moscow with the nerve agent attack. \"If there were to be an involvement of a foreign state, evidenced by this investigation, then obviously that would be very serious indeed, and the government would respond appropriately,\" Hammond told the BBC's Andrew Marr show. The Magnitsky Act, first introduced in 2012, provides US lawmakers with sweeping powers to freeze assets and place travel restrictions on foreign government officials involved in human rights abuses.  Downing Street has so far resisted calls among opposition Labour MPs to draft similar laws in the UK.  However, on Sunday the Chancellor appeared to signal a shift in the government's position. \"We're seeking to reach an accommodation,\" said Hammond in response to a question on the Magnitsky Act. \"The proposals that were put forward actually create a power that we already have.\"Possible consequences Exactly how Britain might respond to evidence that implicated Moscow in the attack remains unclear. Possible options might include the expulsion of Russian diplomats and UK-based pro-Kremlin oligarchs; financial restrictions on figures linked to the Kremlin; and diplomatic efforts involving EU and US allies. The Russian Embassy Monday accused the UK government of playing a \"very dangerous game\" with the investigation, adding it could have \"long-term consequences for our relations\".In a statement on its website, the embassy says it had requested information from the UK Foreign Office on the health of Skripal and his daughter, as well as on the investigation.The embassy said the issue \"has become quite a negative factor for the relations between our countries\".\"We would like to stress once again that we are outraged by the anti-Russian media campaign, condoned by the Government, that influences the investigation and has a psychological effect on British residents. Our compatriots and British nationals of Russian origin are worried about their future in this country. UK-based Russian journalists are receiving threats.\"Previously, the UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the government would \"respond appropriately and robustly,\" promising that \"no attempts to take innocent lives on UK soil will go unpunished.\"Johnson also called into question the UK's diplomatic representation in the 2018 World Cup, to be held in Russia later this year. Military personnel are seen outside Salisbury District Hospital, Sunday.Widening threat Monday's meeting came as public health authorities warned hundreds of people could be affected by the attack, after traces of the nerve agent were detected in the Salisbury branch of Italian restaurant Zizzi and The Mill pub. Speaking with reporters Sunday, England's chief medical officer, Sally Davies, urged customers who visited either location on the same day as Sergei Skripal to wash their clothes and any possessions they had with them at the time. The announcement follows the deployment Saturday of an additional 180 military personnel to help police investigate several sites amid concerns over potential contamination. Police have so far identified more than 200 witnesses and 240 pieces of evidence in the attempted killing, UK Home Secretary Amber Rudd said Saturday.Police previously said they know what nerve agent was used in the attack, but have declined to name it or how they suspect it was administered.The police officer who found the Skripals, Detective Sgt. Nick Bailey, remains hospitalized in serious condition but is \"conversing and engaging\" with visitors, said Rudd.Members of the emergency services in green biohazard suits work to afix the tent over the bench where Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found.Who is Sergei Skripal?In 2006, Sergei Skripal was sentenced to 13 years in prison for spying for Britain, according to Russian state media accounts of the closed hearing.Russian court officials at the time said he'd received at least $100,000 for his work for MI6, the British intelligence service. He was granted refuge in the UK after a high-profile spy exchange between the United States and Russia in 2010.His daughter Yulia is thought to be one of the few members of his immediate family still alive after his wife and son died in recent years. She was visiting him from Russia at the time of the incident.CNN's Mary Ilyushina in Moscow and Simon Cullen in London contributed to this report.",

But what's behind the stamina of this 65-year-old, now contesting his fourth presidential election? Deer antler blood has something to do with it, he apparently believes.Local media reports say that Putin is one of many Russians who have consumed and bathed in blood from the severed antlers of Siberian red deers. Bathers believe the blood gives them strength and stops the aging process.Russian President Vladimir Putin with deer in southern Siberia during a vacation in 2013.On top of the controversial ritual of blood bathing, the belief fuels an entire industry of antler blood-based products, which animal rights groups say are barbaric and have no basis in science.There is no evidence that velvety deer antlers or their blood have a healing effect, but some Russian research institutes have suggested further study into it. Antler harvesting is not for the faint hearted. Each year, the animals are restrained as farmers use a saw to sever their horns.Read MoreCNN visited one of these farms high up in the picturesque Altai Mountains, in Nikolskoe.   \"Of course it's not a drug,\" farm manager Ludmila Korotkhih told CNN. \"It's more of a supplement. But it makes our immune system strong, heals the body and gives us great strength, men's libido in particular.\" A Siberian herdsmen saws off a deer's antlers in the Altai territory of Terekta.The farmers here say it's no big deal for the animals as they grow a new pair of antlers each year.

In fact, he sees deer antler blood as a growing industry. \"People in the Altai have been using the antlers for a very long time,\" he said. \"At first it was a very local thing but then the word spread and there is now a lot of research being done, looking into the use of antlers.\"",

        "content": "London (CNN)It's more than a week in and questions are still swirling over how and why a former Russian spy and his daughter were poisoned in the cathedral city of Salisbury in southern England. Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia, 33, remain hospitalized in \"very serious condition.\"On Monday, British Prime Minister Theresa May answered some of them by telling Parliament it was \"highly likely\" Russia was responsible for the \"military grade\" nerve agent attack on the pair. Russia's Foreign Ministry described May's strongly-worded statement as a \"circus show\" and the latest in a series of \"fairy tales\". While Monday's developments are likely to plunge relations between the UK and Russia to a new low, a number of key questions remain unanswered. How did the Skripals leave such a long trail of contamination? It is staggering, but a statement Sunday from health authorities effectively said the pair were in contact with -- or carrying -- the poison for their entire Sunday afternoon trip. Authorities found traces in the Mill pub and the Zizzi pizza restaurant, as well as on the bench where the two began to lose consciousness. This suggests that they perhaps carried the poison with them. Police officers stand outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant Zizzi close to The Maltings shopping centre in Salisbury.Read MoreBut where did they become initially exposed and get their lethal doses? If they, for example, carried an infected package with them for the afternoon and then opened it somewhere, you would expect a larger concentration in one place. Yet health professionals talked about small traces in both the pub and the pizza restaurant. So, they either got their main dose on the bench -- say from inhaling a cigarette or opening a package -- and immediately succumbed, or were exposed way beforehand. A key question here is how was Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey given a larger dose than other first responders. He was critically ill, but is now recovering. Does that mean he was heavily exposed at the bench, say from trying to resuscitate the pair? Or, as former police commissioner Ian Blair has suggested, did he go to their home after the bench? Was he looking for medicine for the pair in their house? We don't know. But it looks most likely that the pair were exposed at the start of their afternoon in Salisbury and they carried the contamination with them to all three places. This means the agent took hours to affect them.Why did the presumed would-be assassin choose something so specific and traceable?On Monday, Theresa May told Parliament that Skripal and his daughter were poisoned with Novichok, which is a Soviet-era poison made in the '70s to evade various chemical weapons treaties and provide a more stable, two-part agent that was harder to detect. Sergei Skripal Yulia SkripalBut was this ordered at the highest level in the Kremlin? That is in an important question, and there is no hard evidence of that right now. Such an allegation means that Vladimir Putin, less than two weeks ahead of an election (that he will undoubtedly win), had ordered a public killing of a dissident that could really only be traced back to Moscow.It would risk more sanctions on Russia's beleaguered economy and greater isolation: two things that have not played well with an electorate he is careful to keep happy enough. The other option is that it was done by a rogue part of the Russian state, set upon further isolating Moscow or seeking to please a Kremlin that wouldn't be brazen enough to order such an act itself. Or that someone -- criminal or private -- has this deadly agent who should not.The world simply shrugs at Russian aggressionEither option is, of course, bad news, and suggest Moscow is out of control, with nerve agents being used with a reckless disregard for British public safety. This is clearly one reason why London has given Moscow 24 hours to account for these chemical weapon stocks and agree to let UN inspectors in. They almost certainly won't agree to that embarrassment, days ahead of a key election. So we are left with a likely escalation on Wednesday. Why are people in Salisbury suddenly being asked to wash all their clothes? The official response from the UK has been puzzling. At first, they thought it might have been an opioid. Forty-eight hours later the counter terrorism police took the lead in the investigation. And then 24 hours after that they stepped forwards to say they knew the \"specific nerve agent\" it was. Yet, it was only 48 hours after that when the British army was sent in, providing pictures of soldiers in protective suits removing cars and securing gravestones. UK hints at sanctions over Russia spy attackIf there was at no point any risk to public safety -- as health officials insisted from the start -- these images risked looking like they served a political purpose by making the threat seem severe and the military the required response.And then finally, an entire week later, and four days after the agent has been identified, 500 locals who went to the pub or restaurant are told to wash their clothes and themselves.It's a baffling chain of events and shows a government that either did not understand what it was dealing with for an entire week, despite insisting there was no threat to public health, or after seven days is amplifying the threat as the political ramifications rear their head. This story has been updated to reflect the latest developments Monday.",

        "content": "Story highlightsF1 2018 season starts March 25 in AustraliaNew halo device improves driver safetyTeams limited to three engines for 21 racesNew tires tipped to make cars even quicker (CNN)If 2017 was about revolution, the new Formula One season will be about evolution.Last year brought in F1's biggest changes for more than a decade with fatter tires and bigger, more aggressive-looking car chassis resulting in lap records being broken at 11 of the 20 grands prix. The upcoming season, which starts in Melbourne on March 25, will be one of refinement as teams and drivers get to grips with comparatively minor cosmetic tweaks by comparison. Follow @cnnsport\n\nNevertheless, changes to both F1's sporting and technical regulations will likely play a pivotal role in the outcome of both drivers' and constructors' title races in 2018. Here, with the help of F1 technical analyst Craig Scarborough, CNN's The Circuit takes a look at some of the key changes and how it could affect the pecking order. Read MoreSlicker tiresIn 2017, regulations from the FIA, motorsport's governing body, made the tires bigger and 25% wider, harking back to the 1970s and 1980s. The fatter tires offered more grip and speed through corners, giving drivers a heightened thrill through famous turns like Silverstone's Maggots and Becketts and Suzuka's epic 130R. Lap times will absolutely tumble and records will be set all the timeCraig Scarborough, F1 tech expertThis year, Pirelli has rolled the dice again, expanding the choice of slick tires from five to seven with two brand new compounds, Superhard and Hypersoft. The Hypersoft, denoted by a pink strip on the tire wall, and improvements to existing tires are expected to make F1 cars even quicker than they were in 2017.Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen on track at the Bahrain Grand Prix. \"It's going to add lots of speed to the car,\" Scarborough told CNN.\"Tires is one of the areas where you can very easily put performance on the car ... lap times will absolutely tumble and records will be set all the time.\"I think at some of the slightly more aero-focused tracks -- Silverstone (Britain), Red Bull Ring (Austria), Spa (Belgium) -- we could see some pretty stunning laps times this year.\" Pirelli has made all its tire compounds slightly softer this year meaning they should degrade more quickly, and, in theory, complicate race strategies. \"What Pirelli has done this year with the wider range of compounds and this Hypersoft tire is that they've made the entire range of tires much softer and much more short lived. \"What we're hoping is that we get tires that aren't going to last half a race and we can get back to people deciding between harder tires and a one-stop race or softer tires and two-stop strategy.\"It's trying to bring back some of the variability in tire strategy that was lacking a bit in 2017 but had worked so well in 2016.\"Engines - four becomes threeIn a bid to keep costs from spiraling even further out of control the FIA has ruled that each driver will have just three engines for this season's expanded 21-race calendar.Research suggests that teams spent a combined total of \u00a31.3 billion ($1.8 billion) in 2016.  In 2018, the challenge remains the same, balancing reliability and performance, but with one less power unit the stakes are raised.  Mercedes and Ferrari were neck and neck for much of the 2017 season.\"It's potentially going to have a huge impact on the championship result this year across the spectrum from last to first,\" Scarborough said. \"Honda have clearly had issues with reliability, Renault also, while Ferrari have been much better as an entire package although they have had problems,\" Scarborough notes, pointing to the Italian team's troubles at the Malaysian and Japanese Grands Prix weekends.Some teams have been openly critical of the reduction -- notably McLaren and Red Bull which claim it's a false economy. \"There will be plenty of grid penalties (in 2018) and what you would hate to have is a championship decided on grid penalties,\" Red Bull's team principal Christian Horner said in December.\"We are getting to the point where with 21 races for three engines -- it is nuts, really.\"The change will likely favor Mercedes which has reigned supreme in the hybrid turbo era.\"Mercedes were able to come in with almost the perfect engine in 2014 -- the right layout, how the combustion was going to work out, they had the hybrid system control strategies worked out and how to get more power out of the engine during qualifying,\" Scarborough explains. \"Because they were ahead of the curve they had reliability as well. They've had the perfect engine whereas Ferrari, Renault and Honda didn't get the design right first time so in subsequent years they've been trying to play catch up.\"The German team has built a new engine for 2018 which could misfire, but given its recent track record that seems unlikely.   Cockpit safety  One more obvious, and staggeringly unpopular change to the 2018 cars, comes in the shape of the halo.The now mandatory cockpit safety device has been designed to help protect drivers from large bits of flying debris. The general view is perhaps best summed up by McLaren's Fernando Alonso.\"I know that from the aesthetic point of view it's a big impact ... but I don't want to have any more fatal injuries,\" Alonso told CNN last summer.None of us want to see a driver killed live on TV or in testingCraig ScarboroughFirst mooted in 2015, the halo has been rigorously tested and will be able to withstand extreme impacts. READ: Halo prompts mixed response from fansThe halo was devised by a Mercedes team engineer (although it is not an official design of the German team) and was chosen ahead of Red Bull's \"Aeroscreen\" and Ferrari's \"Shield.\" The \"halo\" cockpit safety device is a controversial addition to the 2018 cars.The FIA readily admits that although the halo is far from perfect it is an important step forward in safety.   \"It's quite obvious that the drivers head is the only piece left exposed on the car in the event of lots of different types of accidents,\" Scarborough said. \"On balance, it's an increase in safety. None of us want to see a driver killed live on TV or in testing. \"At the end of the day, safety has always increased and it's always had a negative impact to some degree. You lose something -- goggles, helmets, rollover protection, fuel tanks being moved, the side cockpit protection. Lots of things have taken the driver away from visibility.\"Scarborough says that there are better solutions on the horizon,  and suggests the halo could offer TV fans new, improved views of races.  \"The halo is a compromise -- an interim step to get us safer in the short term before bigger regulation changes come in 2021,\" he says.\"Hopefully they'll put some of the onboard cameras on the halo itself so we could look down on the driver rather that just the angles over his shoulder.\"Who will triumph in 2018?Tweaks to the sporting and technical regulations may be slight compared to 2017 but the impact could be major.It's hard to look past Mercedes continuing its dominance -- the German team has claimed four back-to-back titles since 2014 -- but Scarborough expects Ferrari and Red Bull to push it all the way.

        "content": "London (CNN)British Prime Minister Theresa May said Monday that Russia was \"highly likely\" responsible for the attempted murder of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the English city of Salisbury on March 4. In a strongly worded statement to the House of Commons that is likely to plunge UK-Russia relations to a new low, May said the \"military grade\" nerve agent used in the attack had been identified as Novichok, a substance developed in the Soviet Union in the 1970s. May said the Russian ambassador has been summoned to the UK Foreign Office to explain whether the attack was \"a direct action by the Russian state,\" or the result of the Russian government \"losing control\" of its stock nerve agents.Sergei Skripal Yulia SkripalMay demanded a response from the Russian government by the end of Tuesday. \"Should there be no credible response, we will conclude that this action amounts to an unlawful use of force by the Russian state against the United Kingdom,\" May said.\"Based on the positive identification of this chemical agent by world-leading experts at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down, our knowledge that Russia has previously produced this agent and would still be capable of doing so, Russia's record of conducting state-sponsored assassinations, and our assessment that Russia views some defectors as legitimate targets for assassinations, the government has concluded that it is highly likely that Russia was responsible for the act against Sergei and Yulia Skripal,\" May said. Poisoning of Russian spy raises troubling questionsRead More\"This attempted murder using a weapons-grade nerve agent in a British town was not just a crime against the Skripals. It was an indiscriminate and reckless act against the United Kingdom, putting the lives of innocent civilians at risk. And we will not tolerate such a brazen attempt to murder innocent civilians on our soil.\"Exactly how Britain might respond to evidence that implicated Moscow in the attack remains unclear. Possible options might include the expulsion of Russian diplomats and UK-based pro-Kremlin oligarchs, financial restrictions on figures linked to the Kremlin, and diplomatic efforts involving EU and US allies.White House press secretary Sarah Sanders described the episode as an outrage, calling it \"reckless, indiscriminate and irresponsible,\" though she refused to blame Russia for the attack.\"We stand with our ally and fully support them and are ready if we can be of any assistance to them,\" she added.Russia decries May's 'circus show'Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed May's comments, telling CNN: \"This is a circus show in the British Parliament.\"\"The conclusion is obvious,\" she continued. \"This is another information and political campaign based on provocation.\"Hospitalized Russian spy linked to Russia-UK spy wars \"Before composing new fairy tales, let someone in the kingdom tell you about how the previous ones about Litvinenko, Berezovsky, Perepilichny and many others ended,\" she said, referring to other Russians who died in mysterious circumstances in the UK.Speaking from Moscow before May made her statement, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the UK should \"get to the bottom\" of what happened to the former spy in the English city of Salisbury before talking to him, according to the state-run RIA news agency.Putin was replying to a BBC journalist who asked if Russia was responsible for the attack. According to RIA, he replied: \"Get to the bottom of [things] there, and then we will discuss this with you.\"May: Attack took place against backdrop of 'Russian state aggression'A CCTV image of Sergei Skripal from a local shop, where he was seen just days before his poisoning.The Skripals, believed by authorities to have been deliberately targeted, were found slumped on a bench near a shopping center in Salisbury eight days ago. Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, remain hospitalized in critical condition. A police officer who came into contact with the nerve agent, Detective Sgt. Nick Bailey, remains hospitalized in serious condition but has been speaking to visitors. Novichok is a Soviet-era poison that was made to evade various chemical weapons treaties and provide a more stable, two-part agent that was harder to detect. The relationship between Britain and Russia has been fractious since the assassination of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 but this latest episode will plunge it even further into the abyss.A British inquiry found that two Russian agents poisoned Litvinenko at a London hotel bar in 2006 by spiking his tea with highly radioactive polonium-210, and that Putin \"probably approved\" Litvinenko's killing. The Kremlin has always denied the accusation. Alexander Litvinenko is pictured in a London hospital on November 20, 2006, three days before his death.Both countries have acknowledged the deterioration of relations, with Russian Foreign Secretary Sergey Lavrov admitting in December it was \"not a secret\" that the Russia-UK relationship was at a \"very low point.\" Those relations are unlikely to improve in the wake of May's statement, in which the Prime Minister said the attack in Salisbury had taken place \"against a backdrop of a well-established pattern of Russian state aggression.\" \"Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea was the first time since the Second World War that one sovereign nation has forcibly taken territory from another in Europe,\" May said.\"Russia has fomented conflict in the Donbas, repeatedly violated the national airspace of several European countries, and mounted a sustained campaign of cyberespionage and disruption. This has included meddling in elections, and hacking the Danish Ministry of Defence and the Bundestag, among many others,\" May added, referring to Germany's Parliament. Previously, UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the government would \"respond appropriately and robustly,\" promising that \"no attempts to take innocent lives on UK soil will go unpunished.\"Johnson also called into question the UK's diplomatic representation in the 2018 World Cup, to be held in Russia later this year.Military personnel wearing protective suits remove a police car and other vehicles from a public park park as they continue investigations.May's statement Monday followed a meeting of Britain's National Security Council to discuss the investigation, and came after UK public health authorities warned that hundreds of people may have been affected by the attack. Traces of the nerve agent were detected in the Salisbury branch of the Italian restaurant Zizzi and The Mill pub.Speaking with reporters Sunday, England's chief medical officer, Sally Davies, urged customers who visited either location on the same day as Sergei Skripal to wash their clothes and any possessions they had with them at the time.The announcement followed the deployment Friday of an additional 180 military personnel to help police investigate several sites amid concerns over potential contamination.Police have so far identified more than 200 witnesses and 240 pieces of evidence in the attempted killing, UK Home Secretary Amber Rudd said Saturday.Who is Sergei Skripal?In 2006, Sergei Skripal was sentenced to 13 years in prison for spying for Britain, according to Russian state media accounts of the closed hearing.Russian court officials at the time said he'd received at least $100,000 for his work for MI6, the British intelligence service. He was granted refuge in the UK after a high-profile spy exchange between the United States and Russia in 2010.His daughter Yulia is thought to be one of the few members of his immediate family still alive after his wife and son died in recent years. She was visiting him from Russia at the time of the incident.CNN's Emma Burrows in Moscow, Steve George in Hong Kong and Kevin Liptak in Washington contributed to this report.",

And there was also success for Irish owners, with Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary taking the 2017 leading owner award with four winning horses. Other illustrious Irish owners include millionaire John Magnier and his business associate JP McManus, who have owned many greats at Cheltenham, including Istabraq, a three-time winner of the Champion Hurdle.Michael Creed, Ireland's agriculture minister, summed up the results as \"a celebration of, and an opportunity for us to showcase, all that is good about the industry.\" READ: The female jockey who could be an all-time greatCheltenham becomes an enclave of Ireland in March as thousands of racegoers make the trip. Struggles in the 1980sStill, Irish success at the pinnacle of jump racing wasn't always a given in the 116-year history of the Cheltenham Festival. During the 1980s, race organizers were so concerned about the lack of Irish runners, they went out of their way to bring them back, according to \"Festival fever. The Irish at Cheltenham.\"  \"All the world's a stage...\"#ShakespeareWeek#TheFestival pic.twitter.com/YIkx2PL0SV\u2014 CheltenhamRacecourse (@CheltenhamRaces) March 12, 2018\n\n Because Irish horses were used to jumping softer steeplechase fences at home, they struggled to clear the harder fences at Cheltenham. In the end, Cheltenham organizers managed to persuade Irish racecourses to adopt their fences. Race organizers also moved the final fence at Cheltenham closer to the finish line to overcome a difference in rules in the use of the whip between England and Ireland. Under new rules, English jockeys were only allowed to use their whip for a limited number of strikes. Irish jockeys didn't have such limits and by shortening the run from the last jump to the finish line, organizers made it less likely for Irish jockeys to violate the English rule.

Having had no Irish-trained winners at Cheltenham in 1989, and just two in the two previous years, Irish winners reached double figures in 2006.

        "content": "(CNN)The saga in the English cathedral city of Salisbury has all the elements of a John le Carr\u00e9 thriller -- a double agent, a mysterious and potentially deadly toxin, Cold War leitmotifs, a confounded security service and a flummoxed state government. There is so much grist in the story for conspiracy theorists and, as the truth may never truly be known, it has only compounded the mystery of the events that transpired on Sunday, March 4.That afternoon, former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious on a shopping center bench and were taken to hospital. The pair remain in critical condition. British police say the father and daughter were targeted specifically.The police officer who first found them, since identified as Detective Sgt. Nick Bailey, remains in a serious condition, prompting concern for his safety from UK Prime Minister Theresa May among others. Picture of Wiltshire Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey, 38, the police officer who was left seriously ill after suffering from a nerve agent attack intended to hit former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter.Read MoreBut while many have been quick to blame Moscow, and in particular the Kremlin, for the attack, the overarching question remains: If indeed President Vladimir Putin sanctioned the attack, why did he? And, if Skripal had been living out in the open for years in England without concern, why now?Betrayal is betrayal\"If the Russians want to get someone, they will get someone,\" said Alexey Muraviev, associate professor of national security and strategic studies at Curtin University in Perth, Western Australia.\"If we would assume, and we can only assume at this point, that the Russians decided to (do) this, it would have been achieved on the grounds to showcase again that whoever betrays Russia wouldn't feel immune or secure by being able to leave the country and settle in one of the western countries.\"\"He or she will not remain protected. If the decision is made, he or she will pay the ultimate price for betraying the country and that comes into the national psyche, that betrayal is betrayal.\" JUST WATCHEDFormer Russian spy poisoned by nerve agentReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFormer Russian spy poisoned by nerve agent 02:50In 2006 Sergei Skripal was sentenced to 13 years in prison for spying for Britain, according to Russian state media accounts of the closed media hearing. Russian court officials at the time said he'd received at least $100,000 for his work for MI6, the British intelligence service. He was granted refuge in the UK after a high-profile spy exchange between the United States and Russia in 2010. His daughter Yulia, 33, is thought to be one of the few members of his immediate family still alive after his wife and son died in recent years. She was visiting him from Russia at the time of the incident.\"The traitor's profession is one of the most dangerous in the world,\" said the anchor of a news program on Russia's First Channel in a broadcast on Wednesday. \"According to statistics, it is much more dangerous than a drug courier. Those who chose it rarely live in peace and tranquility to a venerable old age. Alcoholism and drug addiction, stress, severe nervous breakdown and depression are the inevitable occupational illnesses of the traitor. And as a result -- heart attacks, strokes, traffic accidents, and finally, suicide.\"Timing doesn't make senseLinking the attack to Putin requires a \"leap of imagination,\" says Dorothy Horsfield, a visiting fellow at the Australian National University College of Arts and Social Sciences. \"How would he benefit? Creating chaos in Europe? Europe is doing a great job of that by itself.\" More likely, Horsfield argues, is that this would have come from Russian non-state actors, similar to whoever might have carried out the attack on Alexander Litvinenko, a former Russian spy. He was poisoned by two suspected Russian agents at a London hotel bar in 2006 who were said to have spiked his tea with highly radioactive polonium-210. A British public inquiry concluded in 2016 that Putin \"probably approved\" the killing, something the Kremlin denied. The two agents accused of the poisoning also denied their involvement.Members of the emergency services in green biohazard suits work to afix the tent over the bench where a man and a woman were found on March 4 in critical condition at The Maltings shopping centre in Salisbury, southern England.If they went after Skripal, asks Horsfield, \"why did they wait so long? The second thing is, which is entirely speculative, was he really living quietly in Salisbury? Litvinenko was up to all sorts of mischief, he was working with MI6 and liaising with the Spanish mafia and looking at the link there between the mafia and Russian intelligence agents.\"Putin has spent far too much time and money trying to repair his image and raise himself to the \"status of an internationally respected player\" to do this now, argues Horsfield, author of  \"Russia in the Wake of the Cold War.\"But she recognizes that this mystery requires a villain.\"There's a kind of Cold War assumption behind the idea that Putin is the big evil spider in the center of a web controlling these people,\" she said. \"There's lots of links between retired and resigned intelligence operatives [working out of uniform]. One of Putin's greatest problems which he acknowledged in the recent state of the nation address was corruption. How do you control all this?\"Payback?The possibility that disgruntled former intelligence operatives might be behind the attack was one that Mark Edele, an expert in contemporary Russia, agreed was worth considering.\"My theory would be that there is somebody else involved. This guy has given away a lot of Russian agents in the West, so it's possible that this is payback from somebody who might or might not be in the FSB [Russia's successor agency to the KGB],\" said Edele, from the School of Historical and Philosophical Studies at the University of Melbourne.Police officers stand outside the home of  Sergei Skripal after a man and woman were found unconscious in Salisbury town centre two days previously, on March 6, 2018 in Salisbury, England. Given the nature of the weapon used, \"clearly there's professionals behind this, it would make more sense to me.\" Another possibility, he said, was someone connected with organized crime in Russia came to track down Skripal, and found him in an English city of 45,000, which prior to March 4 had been better known as being nine miles from Stonehenge and having an original copy of the Magna Carta. \"If one thinks about the motivation, it's more likely that this is a revenge attack rather than one that goes straight back to the Kremlin. I feel that we might never know because the Kremlin's not going to tell us,\" Edele said.Sowing chaosKremlin critics who believe Putin is behind the incident say this is the latest in the Russian leader's attempts to sow chaos on the continent and add further disruption within British society, which continues to struggle with the prospect of leaving the European Union.\"I would argue that Putin loves Europe, but his current strategy is to divorce Europe from the United States, to compromise the transatlantic connection, take Europe out from the US umbrella and put it under Russia's umbrella,\" said Alexey Muraviev. \"Putin loves Europe. He wants Europe to not be his, but certainly to be aligned side by side with Russia and the Russians continue to pursue Europe quite aggressively.\"He says the frequent support Russia has shown for conservative right-wing political groups in Europe during recent elections, those who might be EU-skeptics, or less friendly towards the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), would sway politics in the region in Moscow's favor, with the hope that it would lead to a softening of harsh sanctions.\"Demonstrating to the Europeans that as long as you continue to support the US you'll be our target, creating this sense of fear among Europeans that their capitals are targets for nuclear-armed missiles,\" said Muraviev. The Russian line, he said, is \"we don't want to attack you, but if we feel threatened we'll retaliate immediately and that's part of effectively attempting to demonstrate to the Europeans that they're better off being neutral, because the US will get them into trouble.\"JUST WATCHEDPutin announces 'invincible' new missileReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPutin announces 'invincible' new missile 00:55The relationship between Moscow and London is more complex says Muraviev, particularly given the \"special relationship\" London has with Washington. That, and the repeated infringements on UK soil by Russia to hunt down defectors and ex-spies, has complicated diplomacy in recent years. \"London handles a number of Russian nationals who Russia wants home to face fraud charges, they're considered to be in political asylum in the UK,\" he said, providing another possible explanation of why this attack occurred.Every day another development provides more material for conspiracy theorists to pore over. At least one tidbit of information might excite them: Salisbury, where the Skripals were attacked, is near Porton Down, a military research facility that specializes in testing chemicals used in war. There, experts are currently looking at samples of the substance that sickened so many in nearby Salisbury.",

The journalists and staff of Cumhuriyet, a nearly century-old secular opposition newspaper, were swept up as authorities clamped down on dissent following an attempted coup in 2016.Read MoreCumhuriyet has remained critical of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, along with his ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP, despite the crackdown.S\u0131k, one of Turkey's most prominent investigative journalists, was tried and imprisoned before for a book he wrote focusing on the infiltration of the Turkish police force by followers of US-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen.He and his Cumhuriyet colleagues are now accused of aiding members of Gulen's movement -- which Turkey says was behind the coup attempt -- in addition to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. Gulen has denied involvement in the failed coup.Colleagues welcome the release of Sabuncu, second left, and S\u0131k, second right, on Saturday in Istanbul.Speaking to reporters after his release Friday, S\u0131k said, \"Today is not a day of celebration. Six years ago in March, I was released. It is March again, but the only thing that has changed is that there is one less partner to fascism in this country. \"But the day will come to celebrate -- the day will come when the reign of this mafia sultanate comes to an end. I guarantee it. This mafia sultanate will go where it deserves one day, and that will be the day we will be happy.\"Since S\u0131k was last freed in 2012, one-time allies Erdogan and Gulen have had a public falling out that reached its nadir in the 2016 coup attempt. The government began purging members of the Gulenist movement from the ranks of the state after the attempted overthrow. The clampdown has cast a wide net, ensnaring journalists and academics. Critics say Erdogan's government has used the coup attempt to silence all opposition voices, including S\u0131k's, under the guise of rooting out Gulenists. Free speech group PEN International welcomed the release of Sik and Sabuncu. \"At the same time, the injustice of Akin Atalay's continued detention is haunting. We call for his freedom and dismissal of the charges,\" said Carles Torner, the group's executive director.Rights group Amnesty International hailed the two men's release at the same time as calling for Turkey to free all journalists and human rights defenders.We celebrate the amazing news of the decision to release #Ahmet\u015e\u0131k and #MuratSabuncu! Long overdue, and without #Ak\u0131nAtalay this time but yet again we say #Journalismisnotacrime and all should be freed. #FreeTurkeyMedia #CumhuriyetDavas\u0131 #JournalismIsNotaCrime\u2014 Amnesty Turkey (@aforgutu) March 9, 2018\n\nOn Thursday, a criminal court in Istanbul sentenced 24 journalists and one activist up to 7\u00bd years in prison, Turkey's state news agency Anadolu reported.All 25 were convicted and sentenced for being associated with the Gulenist movement.The court accused them of \"being a member of a terror group\" and of \"participating in a coup attempt,\" Anadolu said.CNN's Ian lee, Isil Sariyuce and Hamdi Alkhshali contributed to this report.",

        "content": "London (CNN)Former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter were deliberately poisoned by a nerve agent, UK police say, significantly increasing the likelihood that a foreign state was behind the attack.Mark Rowley, head of the counter-terrorism division of London's Metropolitan Police, told reporters that Sunday's incident was being treated as attempted murder. He revealed that one of the first police officers on the scene had fallen sick and was seriously ill in hospital.The developments mean that the British government must confront the suspicion that elements linked to the Kremlin carried out a brazen attack with a deadly agent in the middle of a rural English city, two weeks before President Vladimir Putin seeks re-election for a new six-year term. If a Moscow link were proved, it would plunge relations between the West and Russia into a new low, and would call into question the British government's ability to protect residents of the UK at home. Rowley said officers from Wiltshire police, the local force, were providing support to the sick officer and his families, but insisted there was no evidence of a wider threat to public health.Skripal -- a former Russian military official convicted of spying for the UK -- and his daughter Yulia remain critically ill in hospital after being found unconscious on a shopping center bench. Police said they believe the pair were the specific targets of the attack.Yulia Skripal (R) is thought to be one of the few members of her father's (L) immediate family still alive.\nRead More\"This being treated as a major incident involving attempted murder by administration of a nerve agent,\" Rowley said. Describing the investigation as fast-moving, police urged members of the public to get in touch with any information.Rowley said UK government experts had identified the specific nerve agent used in the attack, but declined to say what it was.The executive director of Europol, the EU's law enforcement agency, described the incident as \"outrageous affront to our security in Europe and our way of life,\" but cautioned not \"jumping to any conclusions\" as to who was responsible. The UK government convened an emergency cabinet-level meeting to discuss the investigation on Wednesday.'Echoes' of the pastConfirmation that a nerve agent was used in the Salisbury attack considerably narrows the range of suspects. Nerve agents, highly poisonous chemicals that that prevent the body's nervous system from functioning properly, are rarely used outside the battlefield and require considerable expertise to develop.

Another nerve agent, VX, was used to kill Kim Jong Nam, the half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, at Kuala Lumpur international airport in February 2017.On Wednesday, UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson warned that Britain would \"respond robustly\" if the Salisbury attack was found to be the work of a foreign power.Johnson had said that there were \"echoes\" in this case of what happened to former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, who died a slow death after drinking tea laced with highly radioactive polonium-210 in 2006 in a hotel in London.Russia spy case a chilling reminder of suspicious deaths in UKA detailed UK inquiry later concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin probably approved the operation by Russian agents to kill Litvinenko.

Follow @cnnsport\n\nOf the eight World Cup tournaments, England's victory in 2003 is the only time the trophy has been won by a Northern Hemisphere side; one of either Australia, South Africa and New Zealand have claimed the rest and been represented in every final. With the All Blacks, world champions in 2011 and 2015, still ranked as the best test side in the world, many would argue this pattern is unlikely to change ahead of next year's tournament.But with eyes currently on the Six Nations tournaments, one former All Blacks captain thinks there's every reason to believe a European side could emerge victorious in Japan.\"We talk about where the major threat to the All Blacks is going to come from in 2019 -- you'd have to say the Northern Hemisphere at the moment in terms of Scotland, Ireland, England,\" Sean Fitzpatrick, who won the inaugural World Cup with New Zealand in 1987 and skippered the side that was defeated by South Africa in the 1995 final, told CNN Sport.

The good news for those Northern Hemisphere contenders is that the All Blacks, for a long time the world's No. 1 ranked side, have appeared vulnerable.

And while South and North Korea didn't march together, the North does have its first ever team at the Paralympics. Follow @cnnsport\n\nThe pentagonal Olympic Stadium in Pyeongchang played host once again, celebrating the 567 athletes from 48 nations preparing to compete over the next nine days in South Korea.Despite the sub-zero temperatures, the athletes were afforded a warm welcome from the 35,000-seater arena with a spectacular performance that drew on South Korean culture via an eclectic mix of traditional buk drumming, 'K-pop' and the climactic lighting of the Paralympic cauldron. Here. We. GO!!! #Pyeongchang2018 starts now! #ParalympicsWatch live @ https://t.co/r6IZJOySMk pic.twitter.com/MpR7uFKguD\u2014 Paralympic Games (@Paralympics) March 9, 2018\n\nThe final ignition of the cauldron was carried out by South Korean wheelchair curling skip Seo Soon-seok, having taken the torch from one of the Olympics' famous 'Garlic Girls' -- Kim Eun-jung, the skip for last month's silver-medal-winning South Korean women's curling team. Read MoreMeanwhile, South Korean President Moon Jae-in was in attendance after global politics turned its head once more to the Korean peninsula with the announcement that a historic meeting will take place between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump. North and South Korea march separatelyIn another development of the inter Korean diplomacy so prominently boosted by the Olympics last month, North Korea indeed will be participating at the Paralympics for the first time. The delegation from north of the border includes two sit-skiers -- Ma Yoo Chul and Kim Jeong Hyun -- who will compete in the para cross-country as wildcard entries, while four \"observing\" athletes have also been sent to attend certain events as spectators. In the Parade of Nations, the delegations from North and South Korea entered under separate flags, unlike the unprecedented unified march at the Olympic curtain-raiser last month. Historic moment as North Korea march at its first Paralympic Winter Games. #Paralympics pic.twitter.com/2Y5ufOYpjj\u2014 Craig Spence (@craigspence) March 9, 2018\n\nThe decision to march separately was made on Thursday following a lengthy meeting between the respective National Paralympic Committees (NPCs).According to reports, the North Korean delegation declined the possibility of a joint march after South Korea removed two small islands claimed by Japan from the unified flag, which depicts the Korean peninsula. \"Although we are disappointed, we respect the decision of the two NPCs who decided that marching separately would be better for both parties,\" recently elected International Paralympic Committee (IPC) President Andrew Parsons said before the ceremony. It was agreed after \"a day of amicable and positive discussions between the two NPCs in the Paralympic village,\" he added.Meanwhile, International Olympic Committee (IOC) spokesperson Mark Adams empathized with the trials and tribulations of such complex diplomatic negotiations, saying: \"We understand the difficulties for the International Paralympic Committee.\"This is not an easy process as we know from our own experience. We were still negotiating right up until the very last moment. Four hours before we still did not have agreement for a joint march.\"Despite the separated marches, there was a moment of unity later in the ceremony as one of the North Korean skiers, Ma, carried the Paralympic torch alongside South Korean cross-country skier Choi Bogue.Beyond the Korean delegations, attention was also focused on the 30 Russian athletes competing as 'Neutral Paralympic Athletes', although their appearance passed without the drama of the Summer Paralympics in Rio, where a member of the Belarusian delegation was removed for waving a Russian flag in protest against the country's exclusion.Unlikely Paralympic stars shineAlongside North Korea, Georgia and Tajikistan are taking athletes to the Winter Paralympics for the first time, with the latter achieving the rare feat of fielding a team at the Paralympics having been absent from February's Olympics. Perhaps even more so than the Olympics, the Paralympics promotes the stories of some of the world's most remarkable individuals -- people who have often pushed themselves beyond anything seen before. READ: US Paralympian Mike Schultz hopes radical prosthetics empower othersAmong the flagbearers at the opening ceremony were many of those figures. Para snowboarder Mike Schultz led out Team USA -- the largest of any NPC at the Games -- having recovered from a life altering snowmobile crash in 2008, engineering prosthetics for himself and fellow competitors along the way. Meanwhile Mexico's sole competitor, Arly Aristides Velasquez Penaloza, carried his country's flag into the stadium with the weight of four years' recovery on his shoulders.The 29-year-old mono skier competed in Vancouver in 2010 but after a serious crash at Sochi 2014 had to undergo severe surgery resulting in a lengthy and tortuous return to Paralympic-levels of fitness. Mexico's sole competitor Arly Aristides Velasquez Penaloza carries his national flag into the arenaAlso defying the odds is Japan's ice sledge hockey goaltender Shinobu Fukushima, who makes an astonishing return to the Paralympics for the fourth time, now aged 61. The unlikely star only took up the sport in his 40s, having seen it at the Nagano Games in 1998. There might not have been a topless Tongan in sight at this opening ceremony, but the Games won't be lacking in stars.",

        "content": "Berlin (CNN)The widow of Alexander Litvinenko has urged the UK government to do more to protect Russians who have sought shelter in Britain following the attempted assassination of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia.The UK government has not yet said who is behind the nerve agent attack on Skripal and his daughter in the southern English city of Salisbury, but speculation is rife that Moscow could be responsible.A British inquiry found that two Russian agents poisoned Alexander Litvinenko at a London hotel bar in 2006 by spiking his tea with highly radioactive polonium-210. From his deathbed, he insisted that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin were responsible for what happened. Alexander Litvinenko is pictured in a London hospital on November 20, 2006, three days before his death.His widow, Marina Litvinenko, told CNN in an exclusive interview Thursday that it was too early to jump to conclusions in the Skripal case. But she acknowledged she had immediately seen \"similarity of a way to assassinate\" between this attack and the case of her husband, whom she refers to as Sasha.Speaking in Berlin, Litvinenko said some lessons had been learned -- but that more should have been done by the UK government. As well as expelling Russian intelligence operatives from British soil, the authorities should \"prevent people who have been involved in crime in Russia who have all this dirty money to bring and use this dirty money in the UK,\" she said.Read More\"But it looks like it did not happen. And now when we are talking about protection, about safety ... it looks like British government can't provide it. And now it's a big issue,\" she said.UK slams 'brazen' attack on Russian spy as Moscow suspicions grow\"If you accept people for political asylum ... like Sergei, like Sasha, and, you know, you have many people in the UK for the same reason. Now how are they made to feel after what happened to this man? Only insecure and very unsafe.\"After her lawyer called to alert her to the news about Skripal, Litvinenko said she was shocked to see images of people wearing protective suits to examine the scene in Salisbury. But she also realized there was now a different level of awareness in Britain.\"It is obvious the public is now in a different stage,\" she said. \"When it happened to us 11 years ago, we (needed) to prove it. Nobody could believe that (the) Russian state was behind all this crime and even for two and a half weeks, when Sasha was in hospital, that Sasha was poisoned at all,\" she said.Organized crimeLitvinenko said she had endured the lengthy and painful process of a public inquiry into her husband's murder in the hope that it would prevent anyone else suffering the same fate on British soil.The inquiry, led by judge Robert Owen, concluded in 2016 that Putin \"probably approved\" the ex-spy's killing.

        "content": "London (CNN)Around 180 British troops have been deployed to the English city of Salisbury to aid in the investigation of a nerve agent attack on a former Russian double agent and his daughter. Personnel from the Royal Air Force, British Army and Royal Navy were among those sent to Salisbury on Friday, a Ministry of Defence spokesman told CNN.London's Metropolitan Police tweeted that the public should not be alarmed and the public health advice remained the same. It explained that the counterterrorism division had requested assistance from the military to \"remove a number of vehicles and objects from the scene.\" A split image showing former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia Skripal.Former Russian spy Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were still hospitalized in \"very serious condition\" after being poisoned earlier this week, UK Home Secretary Amber Rudd said as she visited Salisbury on Friday. The pair -- believed by authorities to have been deliberately targeted -- were found slumped on a bench near a shopping center on Sunday afternoon.  Read MoreRudd visited several of the sites cordoned off by investigators before heading to Salisbury District Hospital. Detective Sgt. Nick Bailey, a policeman who also fell ill, is in serious condition, but is \"conversing and engaging\" with visitors, Rudd added. Authorities earlier revealed 21 people had received medical attention in the aftermath of the incident, but only three people were still being treated Friday.Military personnel, pictured arriving at Salisbury District Hospital on Friday, were deployed to help remove potentially contaminated vehicles and help gather evidence.Kier Pritchard, temporary chief constable of Wiltshire police, which covers Salisbury, told Britain's Sky News on Thursday that \"multiple\" police officers and members of the public had been assessed by medics: \"A number of those had been through the hospital treatment process, there have been blood tests and they're having treatment in terms of support and advice.\"Identifying the source of the nerve agent continues to be central to the probe but so far, Rudd has refused to name any potential culprits. Hospitalized Russian spy linked to Russia-UK spy wars\"We will have to wait until we're absolutely clear what the consequences could be, and what the actual source of this nerve agent has been,\" Rudd said. \"At the moment, our priority is going to be the incident, which is why I'm here.\"Western intelligence services consider Russia a leading suspect based on previous attacks that used a similar substance and method, a Western intelligence official told CNN. The official cautioned that the investigation was still in its early stages.If a Moscow link was proved, it would plunge relations between the West and Russia to a new low, and would call into question the British government's ability to protect UK residents at home. UK Home Secretary Amber Rudd is shown a scene connected to the nerve agent attack on Friday morning.On Friday, Russian Foreign Ministry Sergey Lavrov said Russia was ready to assist \"any investigation\" but that it was \"not necessary to hurl unfounded accusations on TV.\"Earlier this week, a spokesman for the Russian embassy in London described comments by UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson -- who vowed a \"robust response\" in the event that state involvement was proved -- as \"strongly anti-Russian.\" The spokesman said Johnson's comments were an attempt to politicize the affair, and attacked the media for aiding the UK government's efforts.Police say they know the nerve agent used in the attack, but have declined to say what it was or how they suspect it was administered. They called on anyone who visited the area on Sunday, including a branch of the Zizzi restaurant chain or the nearby Bishop's Mill pub, to come forward with any information that might help them piece together what happened.Related: In Salisbury, grist for conspiracy theorists, and an elusive truth     Spy swapSkripal is considered a traitor in his native Russia after a 2006 conviction for spying for the UK, for which he was sentenced to 13 years in prison.He arrived in the UK in 2010 as part of a spy swap between the United States and Russia, when the two countries exchanged agents on chartered planes on a runway at an airport in Vienna, Austria.According to previous reports by Russia's state news agency RIA Novosti,\u00a0Skripal had spied for Britain as an intelligence officer during the 1990s and he had continued to communicate with British foreign intelligence agency MI6 after his retirement in 1999.Skripal's daughter is thought to be one of the few members of his immediate family still alive after his wife, Lyudmila, and son Alexander died in recent years.

        "content": "London (CNN)Questions are swirling over how a Russian official turned British spy and his daughter ended up slumped over a shopping center bench in southern England on Sunday. Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia Skripal, 33, are in critical condition after being poisoned by a nerve agent in what UK police described Wednesday as a \"major incident involving attempted murder.\"While authorities have not yet named suspects or a motive for the attack, the case is a chilling reminder of a slew of mysterious Russia-linked deaths on British soil over the last decade.Alexander Litvinenko An inquiry found that Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned by Russian agents in London.A British inquiry found that two Russian agents poisoned Alexander Litvinenko at a London hotel bar in 2006 by spiking his green tea with the highly radioactive polonium-210. Read MoreLitvinenko died a slow and painful death over weeks after the poisoning and always insisted that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin were responsible for what happened to him. In a statement from his deathbed, he said: \"You may succeed in silencing one man, but the howl of protest from around the world will reverberate, Mr. Putin, in your ears for the rest of your life.\"Russian spy was poisoned by nerve agent, UK police sayOfficials have always dismissed the accusation as \"nonsense,\" but suspicions linger.The inquiry, led by judge Robert Owen, said that Putin \"probably approved\" the ex-spy's killing.The Kremlin has always denied the accusation, as did the two agents accused of the poisoning, whom the Russian government refuses to extradite to Britain.Litvinenko had worked for the FSB, Russia's successor agency to the KGB, the former Soviet secret police and intelligence agency. He specialized in tackling organized crime and his last job at the agency was heading up its anti-corruption department, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, a position that made him many enemies.After leaving the FSB, Litvinenko blamed the service for orchestrating a series of apartment bombings in Russia in 1999 that left hundreds dead and led to Russia's invasion of Chechnya later that year. He went to the UK in 2000 after turning whistle-blower on the agency. According to his widow, Marina Litvinenko, he then started working for Britain's security services. Boris Berezovsky Boris Berezovsky leaves a press conference in London on July 18, 2007.The powerful Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky was found dead in 2013 on the bathroom floor of his home in Berkshire, on the western outskirts of London. British police said at the time they found no sign of a struggle, suggesting the oligarch had taken his own life. Berezovsky had his enemies. He blamed the Kremlin for Litvinenko's death and had fallen out with the government, leaving him self-exiled in the UK.But by the time of his death at age 67, the oligarch was reportedly in financial difficulties after he was ordered to pay a massive divorce settlement to his ex-wife, as well as legal costs following the loss of a $6.5 billion lawsuit against fellow oligarch Roman Abramovich.He had made a good portion of his money from luxury car sales, but his wealth and political influence skyrocketed when he bought into Russian media.Within months of Putin's election in 2000, the government began trying to collect on tax claims against oligarchs, including Berezovsky. He fled to Britain and was later granted political asylum there, irking Moscow.Berezovsky began agitating from Britain against Putin, calling for a coup to oust the Russian President.Berezovsky was convicted of fraud and tax evasion in absentia by a Russian court in 2007. He accused Russia of trying to assassinate him.But, months before his death, Russia confirmed Berezovsky sent a letter to Putin asking permission to return to Russia. \"He admitted that he had made a lot of mistakes, asked forgiveness for the mistakes and asked Putin to let him return home,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, according to a duty officer with the presidential press service.It's unknown whether Putin responded to the letter, but Berezovsky did not return.Alexander PerepilichnyyIn 2015, plant toxicology experts said they found traces of a rare plant poison in Alexander Perepilichnyy's stomach.Alexander Perepilichnyy was a financier who provided evidence of alleged fraud against Russian tax officials. He died suddenly in 2012 at the age of 44 while jogging back to his home in Surrey, southwest of London. It first appeared that the whistle-blower had died of natural causes, but evidence has emerged over recent years suggesting he may have been poisoned. In 2015, plant toxicology experts from the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew told a coroner's court that traces of a rare plant poison, gelsemium, were found in his stomach.In 2017, evidence emerged that he may have had poison slipped in his sorrel soup, a popular Russian dish he had eaten shortly before his death.Police would say later, that they found no evidence that he was poisoned.  Perepilichnyy was helping in a case to uncover a multimillion dollar Russian money-laundering operation at the time of his death.",

The majority of medals will come on snow, with 30 golds on offer in alpine skiing in disciplines such as downhill, slalom and giant slalom divided into standing, sitting and visually impaired classifications. On ice, mixed male and female teams will compete in the wheelchair curling and ice sledge hockey for two of the most prestigious titles of the Games. But just as with the Olympics last month, much of the focus on the Winter Paralympics will be turned away from the sport towards two specific delegations -- North Korea and Russia. Read MoreNorth Korea sends first ever team After the geopolitical waves generated by North Korea's presence at the Winter Olympics in February, history will be made again in Pyeongchang as the host's northern neighbor sends its first ever Winter Paralympic team. The North Korean Paralympic delegation arrived in Pyeongchang Wednesday, according to the South Korean Unification Ministry, just a day after the announcement from Seoul that an historic summit will be held in April between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.The unprecedented meeting came as a result of the Olympic-led thawing of diplomatic tension between the neighboring states.The North's Paralympic delegation includes two cross-country athletes -- Ma Yoo Chul and Kim Jeong Hyun -- and four \"observing\" athletes who will not compete but will watch certain events. North and South Korea marched together at the Olympics opening ceremony under a unified flag.On Thursday, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) announced the two Korean nations will march separately at Friday's opening ceremony -- unlike their appearance under the unified flag at the Olympics' Parade of Nations. IPC President Andrew Parsons said: \"Although we are disappointed, we respect the decision of the two NPCs who decided that marching separately would be better for both parties.\"The decision was made after \"a day of amicable and positive discussions between the two NPCs in the Paralympic village,\" he added. Unlike at the Games last month, there will be no unified team in the ice hockey. There will be, however, an athlete in South Korea's para ice hockey team who was born north of the border. Choi Kwang-hyouk lost his leg after falling from a train as a child. A wheel went over his foot, but doctors, with only rudimentary medical facilities, chose to amputate his leg below the knee -- without anaesthesia. JUST WATCHEDN. Korean defector mixed emotions over OlympicsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHN. Korean defector mixed emotions over Olympics 02:40He was eventually smuggled from North Korea by his father in 2001. In an interview with The Guardian, Choi admitted he is concerned about potentially awkward encounters with his former countrymen.\"I will be happy to see them, but I don't think they will be happy to see me,\" he confessed. \"They'll think I'm a traitor.\"Choi says North Korea's participation is all the more intriguing for its questionable record on human rights for people with disabilities. \"North Korea is a challenging place for the impaired,\" he added. \"It wouldn't be possible for someone with disabilities to participate in the Paralympic Games unless he or she has power and wealth.\"In 2006, a United Nations report said people with disabilities in North Korea were often sent away from Pyongyang to \"collective camps... where they are designated according to their physical deformity or disability.\"Russian athletes 'neutral' againAfter topping the Paralympic medal table at both Sochi 2014 and Turin 2006, Russia will not have an official team in Pyeongchang. As at the Olympics, Russian para athletes will compete as neutrals, but this time under the banner of \"Neutral Paralympic Athletes\" (NPA), removing all reference to Russia from the title. At the Olympics, Russian athletes who could prove they were clean were allowed to compete as \"Olympic Athletes from Russia.\"The IPC suspended the Russian Paralympic Committee ahead of the Rio Paralympics in August 2016 because of its \"inability to fulfil its IPC membership obligations, in particular its obligation to comply with the World Anti-Doping Code.\"Russian President Vladimir Putin alongside former Minister of Sport Vitaly Mutko at the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi, Russia.In January, the IPC reiterated that the ban would be maintained throughout the PyeongChang Games, despite the International Olympic Committee's announcement last week that Russia's Olympic membership has been reinstated.Now just 30 Russian para athletes will compete in Pyeongchang -- less than half the size of the team that competed in Sochi, where it won a record 80 medals, including 30 golds. While their ban was upheld in January,  Parsons added Thursday: \"With a good degree of confidence, we can say that these [Russian] athletes competing here are as clean as any other athletes competing in these Games.\" However, the IPC ban will remain in place until its full list of criteria is met, including the reinstatement of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency by WADA.JUST WATCHEDHear Eileen Gu's remarks about representation after historic Olympic runReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH (15 Videos)Hear Eileen Gu's remarks about representation after historic Olympic runRussian figure skater's entourage under investigation40-year-old gold medalist returns home to a hero's welcomeSkier: My coming out story is my Olympic legacyHear athletes' reaction as Kamila Valieva cleared to compete Abby Roque: US ice hockey star's unconventional path to Beijing 2022Shaun White shares Carrot Top's advice that made him cut his hairFrom Olympic dream to quarantineBenjamin Alexander: From DJ to Jamaica's first ever alpine skierNathan Chen reacts to winning his first Olympic gold Nathan Chen credits iconic figure skater for inspiration after winning goldChloe Kim reveals biggest lesson she learned after 2018 Olympics'I don't even want to watch it': Gold medalist reacts to dad's viral interviewWill the Olympics make winter sports mainstream in China?Reporters press Eileen Gu over her citizenship.

Now, with four years' more experience under her belt, she will be looking to add to her tally. Meanwhile, Canada's Brian McKeever is a hardened Paralympian, competing at every Winter Games since 2002, winning multiple golds at each one. With 13 medals already to his name, there's nothing to suggest the 38-year-old cross-country skier will show any signs of slowing in Pyeongchang. Canadian cross-country skier Brian McKeever takes gold in the 1km sprint, visually impaired, in Sochi.Ticket sales making 'fantastic progress'In October, ticket sales looked like they were going to be at an all-time low for the Paralympics in Pyeongchang, with South Korean media reporting just 0.2% of available tickets had been sold. But five months later the picture looks much brighter for the event organizers.IPC communications and media director Craig Spence told CNN: \"Ticket sales are now at 275,000 which is fantastic progress.\" With only 11% of tickets remaining, the Paralympics are ahead of Olympic sales in percentage terms. Spence added: \"I think the rise in sales has been a result of a real push by the organizing committee to engage the Korean public, strong group sales and a consequence of a successful Olympic Games.\"PyeongChang 2018 Organizing Committee President Lee Hee-beom said: \"PyeongChang 2018 is ready to inspire, educate and excite the world. \"We have the world's best athletes, world-class facilities, and thousands of spectators filled with passion who are ready to witness sporting greatness on the snow and ice. It is going to be a wonderful 10 days that we will never forget.\"The curtain is all set to rise on the first Korean Paralympic Games.And one thing is certain: drama awaits.",

Her comments followed an emergency cabinet-level meeting Wednesday morning to discuss the investigation into the case of Sergei Skripal -- a former Russian military official convicted of spying for the UK -- and his daughter, who were found unconscious Sunday on a bench in southern England. Because of the \"unusual circumstances\" of the case, London's Metropolitan Police said its counterterrorism unit had taken over the investigation from local police.  JUST WATCHEDFormer double agent remains critically ill ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFormer double agent remains critically ill  03:02The high-level meeting comes after UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Tuesday that while he is not \"pointing fingers, as we cannot,\" Britain would make it clear to governments \"around the world that no attempts to take innocent lives on UK soil will go unpunished.\"Read More\"If evidence emerges of state responsibility, the government will respond appropriately and robustly,\" he said.Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia, 33, are critically ill in a UK hospital after passing out on a shopping center bench in the English city of Salisbury, having suffered \"suspected exposure to an unknown substance,\" police said.Skripal was convicted in Russia of spying for Britain before being granted refuge in the UK after a high-profile spy swap in 2010 between the United States and Russia.He is believed to have lived in the UK since his release from Russian custody in 2010. His daughter was visiting from Russia.Yulia Skripal, seen here in a photograph from Facebook, is thought to be one of the few members of the former spy's immediate family still alive.She is thought to be one of the few members of his immediate family still alive after his wife, Lyudmila, and son, Alexander, died in recent years.  Johnson's comments Tuesday drew an acerbic response from Russia's embassy in London, which released a statement saying it \"looks like the script of yet another anti-Russian campaign has already been written.\"In a statement, the embassy said it was \"impressed\" by Johnson's comments, saying he spoke \"in such a manner as if the investigation was already over and Russia was found responsible for what had happened in Salisbury.\"\"We regret that instead of a proper official clarification on the issue the foreign secretary chose to threaten Russia with retribution,\" it read.Russia had not received an official request from British authorities to assist in the investigation, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters Wednesday during a briefing.     Johnson also called into question the UK's involvement in the 2018 World Cup, which kicks off in Russia in 100 days. A UK Foreign Office representative later clarified those comments, stating that Johnson was referring to the UK's diplomatic representation at the event, rather than the English soccer team, which has qualified for the tournament. 'Unknown substance'Salisbury, perhaps best known as the stopping-off point for tourists visiting nearby Stonehenge, has become the unlikely center of an extensive police probe into the mysterious circumstances surrounding how Skripal and his daughter fell ill.A police officer stands outside Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury, close to where the Skripals were found.  Authorities have declined to name the substance to which the pair are suspected to have been exposed.Investigators wearing protective gear and masks were seen Tuesday evening inside Zizzi's restaurant near Salisbury city center, where the Skripals were found. It's one of a number of sites that are being examined in the area. Police are keen to speak to anyone who visited the restaurant or the nearby Bishop's Mill pub on Sunday afternoon.A small number of emergency services personnel were treated immediately after attending a scene of suspected contamination, local police said Tuesday. One of them remains in the hospital.  Additional cordons have also been placed at a scene in the nearby town of Amesbury, police said Wednesday in a statement. This is linked to the investigation and is a precautionary measure, they said. The scene, near Solstice Park, is believed to be an ambulance base.Russia spy case a chilling reminder of suspicious deaths in UKA 'kind' man who bought bacon and scratch cardsLocal convenience store manager Ebru Ozturk told CNN that Skripal was a \"kind customer\" who would usually come in once a week and buy Polish smoked bacon and scratch cards.\"His wife died a few years ago. He was feeling bit sad. He started to get used to living on his own after the wife died,\" said the manager of the Bargain Stop convenience store in Salisbury.\"He is (a) regular customer, he is so kind and he seems to me an educated person.

'Echoes' of prior state-sponsored killingJohnson said Tuesday that there were \"echoes\" in this case of what happened to former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, who died a slow death after drinking tea laced with highly radioactive polonium-210 in 2006 in a hotel in the Mayfair section of London.A detailed UK inquiry later concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin probably approved the operation by Russian agents to kill Litvinenko.  At the time, the Russian Foreign Ministry dismissed the UK investigation as politically motivated.JUST WATCHEDFormer Russian spy deaths through the yearsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFormer Russian spy deaths through the years 02:34Yvette Cooper, an opposition Labour MP and chairwoman of the parliamentary Home Affairs Select Committee on Tuesday called for a review of all suspicious deaths in the UK that could be linked to the Russian state.In a letter to the home secretary, Cooper referred to media reports that suggested 14 deaths of Russians in the UK had raised concerns.\"Surely a review of all these cases and the decisions made on them, in light of this further reported evidence, carried out by the NCA, would be a prudent course of action to ensure that -- as the foreign secretary said today -- no attempt on an innocent life on British soil should go uninvestigated or unpunished,\" Cooper said.Who is Sergei Skripal?Skripal arrived in the UK as part of an elaborately choreographed spy swap conducted by the United States and Russia in which the two countries exchanged agents on chartered planes on the runway at an airport in Vienna, Austria.Sergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars in 2006.Skripal had been sentenced in 2006 to 13 years in prison for spying for the UK, according to previous reports by Russia's state news agency RIA Novosti.State news quoted Russia's Federal Security Service, or FSB, saying Skripal, a former Russian military intelligence colonel, was convicted for \"treason in the form of espionage\" and that he had been recruited by Britain's MI6 intelligence service.The report said he had spied for Britain as an intelligence officer during the 1990s and had continued to communicate with MI6 after his retirement in 1999.Russian court officials said Skripal had received at least $100,000 for his collaboration with MI6, RIA Novosti reported.CNN's Zahra Ullah, Milena Veselinovic and Carol Jordan contributed to this report",

        "content": "London (CNN)Meghan Markle is now a fully fledged member of the Church of England after the American actor was reportedly baptized and confirmed in a secret ceremony at St James's Palace in London this week. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby administered the holy sacrament in a 45-minute service on Tuesday evening at the palace's Chapel Royal with her fiance, Prince Harry, by her side, UK media outlets reported, quoting the Daily Mail.Kensington Palace has not made a public statement but Prince Charles and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, were also said to have been among the handful of guests in attendance.  Welby was reportedly asked to lead the service by Markle, 36, with whom he has developed a close bond after providing guidance on the rites and sacraments of the Church in recent weeks. As part of the ceremony, holy water from the River Jordan was poured on Markle's head, the Mail reported.Read MoreIt was not necessary for Markle -- who attended a Roman Catholic high school but was brought up Protestant -- to convert in order to marry Prince Harry, but she announced at the time of her engagement that she would do so anyway before their wedding in mid-May.\n\n\n\n\nLambeth Palace, the official London residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury, declined to comment Thursday when asked about the service.Markle's formal acceptance into the Anglican Church is the latest arrangement by the royal couple ahead of their wedding in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. The move appears to be a mark of respect to Queen Elizabeth II, who is head of the Church of England. Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge and wife of Harry's brother, William, was confirmed shortly before her wedding in 2011. Neither William nor Catherine was present on Tuesday evening, the Mail reported.The decision to conduct the rite at the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace will hold special importance for Prince Harry. The body of his mother, Diana, the late Princess of Wales, lay there for a week before her 1997 funeral. More recently, it was the chapel chosen to host the christening of Prince George in 2013.Female empowermentOn Thursday, Prince Harry and Markle will visit Birmingham to launch a project aimed at inspiring female students to mark International Women's Day.The pair hope to encourage young women to pursue STEM careers at an event hosted by social enterprise Stemettes.The pair have made numerous public appearances since their engagement as well as spending a traditional Christmas with other members of the royal family including the Queen and her husband, Prince Philip.Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge attend the first annual Royal Foundation Forum held at Aviva on February 28 in London.They also appeared along side the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge -- dubbed the \"Fab Four\" by the British press -- earlier this month to speak about the future of the young royals' charity, the Royal Foundation.Markle admitted the next few months would be busy with wedding preparations, but said she planned to \"hit the ground running\" in her work to empower girls and women in the UK following her nuptials.Public invited to big dayEarlier this month, Kensington Palace announced that more than 2,600 members of the public will be invited into the grounds of Windsor Castle to share in the royal couple's wedding day.The invitees will be able to watch the arrivals of the bride and groom and their guests at St. George's Chapel and to watch the newlyweds depart the castle on a carriage procession through the town of Windsor.Thousands of people without specific invitations are expected to line the procession route through the town of Windsor, which is about 40 km (25 miles) west of central London.The wedding will take place at 12 p.m. GMT (7 a.m. ET) on May 19 and will be officiated by the Dean of Windsor, the Right Rev. David Conner and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Kensington Palace revealed last month.This story has been updated to correct the Duchess of Cornwall's title.CNN's Judith Vonberg contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Copenhagen, Denmark (CNN)There is nothing routine about the murder trial opening Thursday at the City Court of Copenhagen. Nearly seven months after the mutilated torso of Kim Wall washed ashore, Danish inventor Peter Madsen is expected to take the stand, charged with killing the 30-year old Swedish journalist. As the prosecutor presents his case in one of the most gruesome murder trials in Danish history, special accommodations are in place for nearly 80 local and foreign reporters in a race for details. It will not be easy listening.According to the prosecution, the promising young reporter died under the cruelest of circumstances. Madsen pictured inside his submarine in April 2008. Read MoreThe indictment states that Madsen, 47, planned and prepared Wall's murder, bringing a saw, a knife, sharpened screwdrivers and other items to his submarine where he had supposedly invited her to do a story. Instead, according to the indictment, Madsen cut and stabbed Wall multiple times before killing her, cutting off her head, arms and legs, then weighing her body parts down with plastic cable-ties and pipes before throwing them into the sea.The charges include premeditated murder, indecent handling of a corpse and \"sexual relations other than intercourse of a particularly dangerous nature,\" citing stab wounds inside and outside her genital area.Well known in DenmarkThe alleged murder has rocked the peaceful Danish archipelago and its Swedish neighbor to the core -- albeit in different ways.While Sweden seemed immediately besieged by grief at the loss of one of its own, Denmark seemed caught in shock and disbelief.To them, Peter Madsen, or \"Rocket-Madsen,\" was a well-documented character, portrayed in books, articles, documentary films, even on Danish children's programs, as an eccentric but visionary inventor with a strong passion for ocean and space travel.\"I don't know what to say. I was shocked, I still am,\" said Tomas Trolle, who helped Madsen with some of his rocket projects. \"I didn't believe it because I knew him a little bit. He was a nice guy who really liked to show off his projects.\"A woman alleged to be Kim Wall stands next to a man in the tower of the private submarine UC3 Nautilus on August 10 in Copenhagen Harbor.  Madsen's dream was to become the first Dane to fly into space in a privately built rocket. And, at the time of its maiden voyage in 2008, UC3 Nautilus, the submarine that Kim Wall stepped aboard on August 10, was said to be the world's largest privately built submarine.\"Everybody had heard about him, knew about his projects, knew about the submarine, and all the rockets,\" said Trolle. As the investigation continued, Trolle and others who knew him waited for information that would help Madsen's case, but police kept presenting more damaging evidence.Danish Defense Command divers prepare for a dive near Copenhagen after the discovery of what turned out to be Wall's torso last August. For his part, Madsen changed his explanation several times as more body parts and evidence emerged.Amongst other things, police found films showing torture and real-life executions of women on his computer. Madsen has consistently denied the allegations of murder and sexual assault and any knowledge of the films. He maintains that Wall died by accident, saying he dismembered her body and tossed it in the sea in a state of panic. His attorney, Betina Hald Engmark, has said it cannot be excluded that it was an accident and that Madsen did act in a state of panic.Unusual twistsIf Madsen has a dark side, it is likely to be one of the points explored by prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen during the trial, at which some 37 witnesses are expected to take the stand.\"It seems unusual to call that many witnesses in this case since they obviously were not present at the scene of the crime,\" says Lasse Lund Madsen, professor of criminal law at Aarhus University, and former special prosecutor and acting judge. \"That means some of them are likely there to shed light on surrounding factors, I would assume to try to prove the murder was planned.\" Wall, pictured in Majuro, the capital of the Marshall Islands, in 2015.In another twist, at Madsen's request, the trial will take place before a judge and just two jurors instead of the typical six- or nine-person jury. \"The defense must believe this will be an advantage,\" says Lund Madsen. \"I can't speak to the exact strategy, but this is normally something you might do when the case is one of great emotion, in the hope that less jurors could provide a more objective decision.\"If found guilty, Madsen will spend the rest of his life in prison if the prosecution has its way. But in a country where a murder sentence typically carries 12 years, it will still take a significant burden of proof to show enough aggravating circumstances to warrant a life sentence. The verdict is scheduled for April 25.",

But the study, conducted as part of the Thoroughbred Horseracing Industries MBA at the University of Liverpool, said women jockeys are just as good as the men when it comes to riding racehorses, and found there was no difference between genders once the quality of horses was taken into account.  \"Racing is steeped in history and history creates opinions, it's as simple as that,\" Frost said, when asked why there is a perception that women aren't as good as men at racing horses. \"But they're not facts, you don't need to listen to them.\"She added: \"I wouldn't think of myself as any different, or having to take a step back because I am a girl.\"READ: female jockeys as good as men, study revealsGrand NationalNicholls, a trainer who has produced 115 Grade 1 winning horses including four Cheltenham Gold Cup winners, has been full of praise for Frost.\"Horses run and jump for her and today is a great example of why we have a lot of faith in her,\" Nicholls told reporters after Frost won at Kempton Park on Boxing Day.\"If she is lucky and stays in one piece she will be as good as any girl who has ever ridden.\" Although Frost said she doesn't have an idol when it comes to riding, she is dreaming of stepping into the footsteps of her father, who won the Grand National at Aintree Racecourse near Liverpool, England, six years before she was born.JUST WATCHEDSkijoring: One of the wildest sports aroundReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSkijoring: One of the wildest sports around 01:16\"The Grand National is looming large, and it means a lot to me because of my dad,\" Frost said. \"It's been wrapped in my world ever since I was a little girl, so its going to be cool. \"I am going to be really looking forward to getting there and lining up and going on to that first [hurdle], and who knows what will happen?\"",

        "content": "Copenhagen, Denmark (CNN)Danish inventor Peter Madsen pleaded not guilty to murdering Swedish journalist Kim Wall aboard his submarine last August, but acknowledged dismembering her corpse, as his trial began in Copenhagen on Thursday. Madsen faces charges of premeditated murder, indecent handling of a corpse and \"sexual relations other than intercourse of a particularly dangerous nature,\" citing stab wounds inside and outside Wall's genital area.Wall, a promising 30-year-old journalist, was last seen after boarding Madsen's UC3 Nautilus on August 10 last year when she had planned to interview him for an upcoming article. Instead, according to the indictment, Madsen stabbed Wall multiple times before killing her, cutting off her head, arms and legs, then weighing her body parts down with plastic cable-ties and pipes before tossing them into the sea.Her torso washed up on August 21 on an island near Copenhagen. Her head and legs were found weeks later. Read MoreMadsen takes the standMadsen pictured inside his submarine in April 2008.Madsen took the stand on Thursday and claimed he had dismembered Wall's body in a panic after she accidently died of carbon monoxide poisoning. Madsen told the court that Wall died because of a mistake he made on the submarine which caused dangerous gases to be released inside the vessel, where Wall was. Madsen claimed he was outside at the time and that the interior pressure prevented the hatches from opening. His account was that he yelled for Wall to shut down the engines, allowing him to re-enter the sub, and at that point, he found her lifeless body. Madsen explained he did not tell the truth for months in an attempt to spare her family pain. \"I didn't want to share with the world how Kim Wall died and in particular with her family,\" he said. Kim Wall's work had appeared in the Guardian and the New York Times. \n\"As I see it I am now at fault in a serious crime. I expect to be charged with involuntary manslaughter, and I expect to go to prison for a long time, and I know that everything I have worked for since I was a small boy is lost.\"Wall's last communication -- a text message sent to her boyfriend -- was also revealed in court Thursday. It read: \"I am still alive btw but heading down now! I love you!!!!! He brought coffee and cookies too.\"Evidence against Madsen revealedOn Thursday, prosecutor Jacob Buch-Jepsen told the court that more than 215 witnesses had been questioned while the police had received more than 1,000 tips in relation to Wall's death.The court heard that Madsen was questioned the day after Wall vanished. Police found fresh scratches on his arms and dried blood on his left nostril, which was later confirmed to belong to the missing journalist, Buch-Jepsen said.  Madsen, known as \"Rocket-Madsen\" in Denmark for his eccentric inventions and strong passion for ocean and space travel, originally claimed he had dropped Wall off on land on the night of August 10, according to a police statement. Later, he claimed she died after he accidentally dropped a 155-pound metal hatch on her head and she fell. A woman alleged to be Kim Wall stands next to a man in the tower of Madsen's private submarine UC3 Nautilus on August 10, 2017 in Copenhagen Harbor. But as authorities continued examining the circumstances surrounding Wall's death, more damaging evidence against Madsen emerged, leading them to allege that the inventor had prepared for Wall's murder, bringing a saw, a knife, sharpened screwdrivers and other items to his submarine. Among other things, the court heard Thursday that divers scouring the seabed last October found a saw with an orange handle, similar to one seen hanging in Madsen's workshop in footage shot by an international film crew on the same day Wall went aboard the submarine.After Wall's disappearance, the saw was no longer present in footage or photographs of the workshop, Buch-Jepsen added. The prosecutor also revealed Wall's clothing was found in a bag in the ocean but some of her underwear was located in the submarine. In the course of the investigation, police also found Madsen had searched the internet for beheadings. Police found videos of torture and real-life executions of women on his computer and hard drives.A subsequent medical examination concluded Madsen appears to be \"perverted and highly-sexually deviant,\" and suggested he should be placed in \"forvaring\" -- a type of preventive custody with no time limit.  Madsen has consistently denied the allegations of murder and sexual assault and any knowledge of the videos.Betina Hald Engmark, Madsen's attorney, has said it cannot be excluded that her death was an accident and that Madsen did act in a state of panic. In her opening remarks Thursday, Engmark asked the court to put aside the extensive press coverage of the case.Wall graduated from Columbia University and the London School of Economics and was based in Beijing and New York. At the time of her death, the journalist's work had appeared in the New York Times, the Guardian and Time magazine, among other publications.CNN's James Masters contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Madrid, Spain (CNN)Thousands of women are refusing to work, boycotting domestic tasks and occupying the streets around the world as part of a global strike on International Women's Day.A year on from \"A Day Without a Woman,\" which saw women across the United States boycotting paid and unpaid labor to highlight the impact of women on society, people around the world responded to the call for a global women's strike on Thursday.Strikes are going ahead in several European countries, with the movement gaining the most traction in Spain, where the gender pay gap is 19% in the private sector and where reports of violence against women are on the rise.\"Today we claim a society free of oppression, exploitation and sexual violence,\" said the organizers of the nation's first \"feminist strike\" in their manifesto. \"We call for rebellion and the struggle against the alliance between patriarchy and capitalism that wants us to be docile, submissive and silent.\"Protests began at midnight, with women gathering in Madrid's central square.Twenty-four hours of strikes and rallies kicked off at midnight in the capital Madrid. Protesters gathered at the central square banging pots and pans as the city council buildings behind them were lit up in purple, the official color of #IWD2018.Read MoreAs light dawned, demonstrators began gathering in cities across the country to call for an end to unequal pay and precarious working conditions, and to draw attention to the role of women in \"devalued\" domestic labor.'I never told anyone': 5 women's stories of sexual abuse at the Hajj\"I am here to prove that if women stop, the world stops,\" said Ines Arias, a university administrator, who joined hundreds of others to demonstrate in Madrid's university district. \"Because we do much more than working.\"Men had also come along to show their support.\"We need to change the laws, but also the culture, the society we have created,\" said Roberto Guerra, a union representative at the National University of Distance Education. \"I am here for my female colleagues, my friends, my neighbors, for society.\"\"Many women in history have proved our value and we prove it everyday, in our jobs, in our houses,\" said Paloma Aguilera, on strike in Madrid. \"It is important that people recognize it.\"Hundreds of students from the city's universities soon joined the protest, shouting, \"Don't bring me flowers, bring me rights,\" \"No means no, the rest is rape\" and \"Madrid will be sexism's grave.\"In a seated protest, they blocked two lanes of a central thoroughfare as police directed traffic around them. Students in Madrid partially blocked a central road in the city's university district Thursday.\"We have to get rid of the idea that the women can do everything, that we can work but we also have to tend to the house,\" said Paloma Morillas, a 19-year-old physics student. \"Housework has to be shared.\"The \"8 March Commission\" -- the umbrella group organizing Thursday's strike -- is also inviting women to spend no money for a day to highlight their power as consumers.Fifteen demonstrations and more than 100 gatherings are scheduled in locations across the country. Most of the country's unions are backing the walkout and called for a 24-hour strike, while two of the biggest -- the General Union of Workers (UGT) and the Workers' Commissions (CCOO) -- have asked their members to stop work for two hours.In Lesotho, women say they're finding their abortions on FacebookMore than five million people joined the two-hour strike, according to UGT and CCOO. Unai Sordo from CCOO said about 10,000 people demonstrated in central Madrid, with another 2,000 students marching through the university district in a separate protest. In Barcelona, 7,500 protesters assembled in Sant Jaume square for the strike, according to a spokesperson for the local government.Demonstrators hold a placard reading \"Manolo today you'll do your dinner on your own\" during the one-day strike in Barcelona. Some of the country's top politicians are backing the strike, including Manuela Carmena and Ada Colau, the mayors of Madrid and Barcelona, respectively. The ruling People's Party does not support the movement, however, with Minister of Defense Maria Dolores Cospedal speaking out against the strike earlier this week.Minister of Health, Social Services and Equality Dolors Montserrat also questioned the usefulness of a women-only strike and defended those who are choosing to continue working.\"The feminine evolution belongs to everyone, including men, but each person does it in their own way,\" she said in an interview with radio station Cadena SER.According to a survey last week by Spanish newspaper El Pais, 82% of Spaniards believe there are sufficient reasons for the strike, with 72% of men agreeing that sexist behavior is widespread in the country. Demonstrators gathered at the Sant Jaume square in Barcelona Thursday during the one-day strike. By dusk, 170,000 people flooded the streets of the Spanish capital, according to a spokesperson for the Spanish government. The General Union of Workers estimated the crowd at 1 million. Demonstrators rallied at the Plaza de Cibeles in central Madrid, spilling out to streets as the evening progressed.Thousands of people demonstrate in central Madrid for #InternationalWomensDay pic.twitter.com/FzsNZaxO4a\u2014 Laura Perez Maestro (@LauraCNN) March 8, 2018\n\nNine-year-old Indira Bravo donned a purple scarf and marched with her mom.

However, the Crown Prince will also face protests by human rights campaigners outside Downing Street over Saudi Arabia's role in the war in Yemen, in which thousands of civilians have died while millions more are afflicted by acute malnutrition and cholera. Electronic billboards show adverts for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on London on Wednesday.In response to lawmakers' questions Wednesday about UK arms deals with Saudi Arabia and the use of UK-made weapons in Yemen, May said she would raise concerns over the humanitarian crisis during talks with the Crown Prince.Read More\"We are all concerned about the appalling humanitarian situation in Yemen and the effect it is having on people,\" she said. \"That's why as a government we increased our funding for Yemen... we are the third largest humanitarian donor to the Yemen.\"The trip, which also includes stops in Egypt and the United States, is seen as part of an effort by the Crown Prince -- considered a key power player behind the King and a reformer by Saudi standards -- to \"rebrand\" Saudi Arabia and show its openness to change. It has been accompanied by a major Saudi PR drive in which his image has been projected onto billboards in London; protesters have responded in kind.Three billboards protesting against an official UK visit by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman are driven around Parliament Square, London.He and his delegation will also seek to reassure international business leaders rattled by the Crown Prince's recent anti-corruption sweep, in which about 200 people -- including business executives, officials and at least 17 princes -- were arrested last year.Meanwhile, May, who visited Saudi Arabia in November, will be keen to capitalize on the Crown Prince's visit to strengthen trade and security ties ahead of Britain's departure from the European Union. The two countries could sign more than a dozen memorandums of understanding during his visit and may seek to improve the visa relationship between their countries to ease travel for business representatives and tourists.JUST WATCHEDThe 32-year-old trying to revamp Saudi ArabiaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe 32-year-old trying to revamp Saudi Arabia 01:30\"The visit will usher in a new era in our bilateral relations with one of our oldest friends in the region,\" a UK government press statement said, adding that Britain hopes to find new business opportunities as a result of the Crown Prince's modernization program, Vision 2030.Opposition Labour lawmaker and shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry criticized the red-carpet welcome given to the Crown Prince in an opinion piece for Britain's Guardian newspaper in which she highlighted the civilian toll of Yemen's civil war. She described the visit as being \"about nothing but filthy lucre, and this government's desperation to plug the hole that will be left in Britain's trade and growth prospects\" by Brexit.The Muslim Association of Britain warned against entering into trade with Saudi Arabia \"at the expense of essential values\" and said recent \"superficial\" reforms by the Saudi government should not be taken at face value.\"The issue of human rights must absolutely remain at the very heart of any discussion, trade or otherwise, with Saudi Arabia,\" it said in an open letter to the Prime Minister on the eve of the visit.A life-size statue of a child is pictured outside of the Houses of Parliament on Wednesday as part of a protest by the charity Save The Children against the visit by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Britain is already a major supplier of arms to Saudi Arabia but post-Brexit will increasingly have to compete with European arms industry.The UK government has come under intense pressure over its sales of arms to Saudi Arabia amid concern they could be used in Yemen in breach of international humanitarian law. However, a UK High Court ruling last year rejected claims that it acted illegally in allowing the sale of arms to its powerful Gulf ally.Saudi Arabia has waged a long military campaign in Yemen in support of the internationally recognized government that Houthi rebels drove out of the capital, Sanaa.

The others are also due to serve prison terms, the shortest being four years.According to CNN affiliate ARD, prosecutor J\u00f6rn Hauschild had called for the defendants to be jailed for between five and 11  years.Read MoreSix of the eight were found guilty of attempted murder and two of aiding and abetting in attempted murder. Anti-immigrant sentiment runs high in Saxony, the state in eastern Germany where Freital is located. It was there that the right-wing, anti-Islam Pegida group was founded in 2013, and the state has one of the highest rates of attacks on refugees in the country.The anti-immigration party Alternative for Germany (AfD) won 27% of the vote in Saxony in last year's federal election, the most of any party and more than double the AfD's proportion nationwide.Protesters demonstrate against the arrival of refugees in Freital in June 2015. The aim of the attacks by the group was to \"generate a climate of fear and repression,\" according to a statement from the prosecutor, who alleged that the group procured explosive materials from the Czech Republic illegally, which they later used to make pipe bombs. On the opening day of the trial, Maria K.'s attorney told the court his client admitted guilt and regretted her actions, according to ARD. No statements were made on behalf of the other seven defendants.There is no requirement for defendants to enter a plea under German law.The defense team had argued that the group was neither a criminal not a terror organization and that the attacks were spontaneous rather than planned, according to German media reports.Several people were injured as a result of the explosions. During one attack on a refugee home in Freital on the night of October 31, 2015, seven of the accused allegedly attached explosive devices to three windows after identifying that people were inside those rooms. More than one million asylum seekers and refugees arrived in Germany in 2015 alone, many of them fleeing war in Syria.CNN's Atika Shubert contributed to this report.",

He maintains the overwhelming support of the Russian people, while the state has kicked his main opponent out of the race and sanctioned other candidates in the running.The outcome is so deeply etched in stone, even Putin himself seems bored. His campaign has been woefully lackluster. But on March 18, there will be one thing for the President to worry about: Turnout. It could be embarrassingly low, some polls suggest, and could raise questions about the legitimacy of Putin's long-running authority.Does turnout matter?Putin is seeking a second consecutive term as president -- a fourth altogether -- to cement his power.Read MoreWithout real opposition, the 65-year-old veteran leader has provided little vision for the next six years and is expected to skip televised election debates, which he has snubbed many times in previous votes.Supporters of Putin's main opponent, Alexei Navalny, call for an election boycott on January 28 in Moscow.But those decisions may have ramifications this time around. The problem with an election that doesn't look like one is that it's very difficult to get voters excited about it. With not even a chance of a surprise result, Putin is now battling voter apathy.Putin's main political opponent, Alexei Navalny -- who has been banned from contesting the election -- has campaigned for a boycott. Legions of young Russians tend to listen to him.Putin regime is 'built on corruption,' opposition leader Alexei Navalny says The Kremlin wants the golden 70-70 --- a win of 70% of the vote with a turnout of 70% -- to give it a clear mandate and provide it with a riposte to Western leaders who criticize Russia as an autocracy.But 70-70 is unlikely. In a poll by the independent Levada Center in November last year, only 24% of respondents said they would definitely vote. Another 34% said they were \"likely\" to but hadn't decided. The government dubbed the Levada Center a \"foreign agent\" in 2016, effectively barring it from polling the vote. State-run polling bodies, like the Russian Public Opinion Center, claim there will be a much higher turnout, above 70%.Low turnout won't kick Putin off his pedestal -- Russia has no minimum turnout rules for the vote to be valid -- but it could scuttle any plans he might have to stay in power beyond his maximum term.Who is running against Putin?Navalny is Putin's most vocal opponent, but an embezzlement conviction has forced him out of the race. The activist -- who rose to prominence for exposing Russian oligarchs' corrupt practices -- says his conviction was politically motivated and devised to keep him off the ballot.Seven other candidates are challenging Putin in the vote. If no one gains more than 50%, a run-off vote will take place in April.Two candidates in particular stand out:Pavel Grudinin: The strawberry kingPavel Grudinin has been vocally critical of corrupt oligarchs.Pavel Grudinin, 57, is expected to come second in the race but with only around 7.6% of ballots, a poll by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center shows. He is seen as a capitalist communist, who took an old state-run strawberry farm in 1995 and privatized it as a social enterprise. The Lenin Sovkhoz farming complex is a throwback to the Soviet era but with the cash flow of capitalist Russia.The enterprise reportedly pays its workers significantly higher wages than other farms and provides them with modern apartments and health care, as well as parks and subsidies for their children. His farm has given him a model to point to when he talks of his vision for the country.\"When people ask me why I'm running, I say: I want everyone in Russia to live like this, like we do. And that's possible,\" Grudinin said at a political event in January, according to the Financial Times.He is vocally critical of the Russian elite and its corrupt practices, but his critics say that he too has been sanctioned by the Kremlin.Grudinin was elected to Moscow's regional Duma in 1997, and he joined Putin's United Russia party in 2001, when it was established. He lost his seat a decade later and is now backed by the Communist Party.On Monday, state news agency Tass reported that an election official accused Grudinin of having $1 million in Swiss bank accounts, even though he had notified the Central Election Commission that all his foreign accounts had been closed. Grudinin denied the allegations in a Facebook post, suggesting they were aimed at smearing him ahead of the vote.Ksenia Sobchak: The reality-TV starJUST WATCHEDCan Putin's opponent win presidency?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCan Putin's opponent win presidency? 01:12Ksenia Sobchak is not your typical Russian politician. The 36-year-old is a former talk show host and reality TV star, and while she has been dubbed \"Russia's Paris Hilton,\" she has shown that she has more to offer than a typical socialite. But she has struggled to convince Russians she isn't one of Putin's puppets. That her father, a former St. Petersburg mayor, was Putin's mentor doesn't help her case. She was born into the world of the political elite and her critics say she is being used to give the vote an air of legitimacy.Nonetheless, she is one of the few candidates openly criticizing the system.\"In Russia, unfortunately, we have a joke that you cannot choose your parents, you cannot choose your gender and you cannot choose your president,\" she told CNN's Fareed Zakaria in an interview. She has said, however, that she wants to influence the Kremlin from the inside and to at least change the conversation. She is pushing a liberal, Western-friendly agenda.She advocates for LGBTI rights and says Crimea belongs to Ukraine. She recently toured think tanks in Washington and even apologized in a CNN interview for Russia's meddling in the US election.What are the key issues?Putin has become synonymous with the system,  and polls regularly show him with incredibly high rates of popularity, even at times when satisfaction with the government is below 50%.For many Russians, the economy is a key issue. The country endured three years of declining real wages as inflation rose rapidly from 2014, forcing Russians to save aggressively when wages were pitifully low to begin with. In the nick of time for Putin, the economy began emerging from recession last year and inflation has come under control.Prices in Russia soared during the recession.And last month, Russian lawmakers finally passed legislation to raise the minimum wage from May 1, some nine months ahead of schedule.It's a meager increase of 2,000 rubles ($35) a month, bringing the minimum monthly wage to a \"subsistent\" 11,163 rubles ($197).The Kremlin is touting the law as a big political win, but as St. Petersburg-based analyst Irina Meyer-Olimpieva puts it, it's an increase on \"an embarrassingly low minimum wage by a ridiculously low margin to reach a depressingly low subsistence level.\"What does this mean for the West?Mueller team asks about Trump's Russian business dealings as he weighed a run for presidentPutin's willingness to jump into feuds with Western powers, especially the US, has characterized much of his current term, and while it's made him something of a villain in the West, it has made him a hero at home.Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine triggered crippling international sanctions on the country and has been at the center of Russia-Europe tensions. Yet the Kremlin used a murky interpretation of the law to delay the election date to March 18 -- the same date Russia took Crimea four years ago. It is a celebrated page in Putin's history: His popularity soared from 69% to 80% after the annexation, Levada polls show, and it has remained high, even through more than two years of recession that followed.It seems Putin is banking on the date to boost participation numbers -- an eyebrow-raising measure for an ironclad leader in a one-horse race.",

The documentary, called World Order 2018, has already been posted online and will air later on state TV.In the interview, Putin is asked if there was disappointment with Trump, and the Russian leader responded with praise of Trump's personal attributes before getting into his criticism of the US government as \"unpredictable.\"\"On a purely human level, he made a very good impression on me,\" Putin said. \"It seems to me that he is well-balanced.

She was just 15 years old when the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics began.But Estonia's Kelly Sildaru is already an extreme sports phenomenon, inspiring rivals that have been competing for longer than she's been alive. On the slopes of Aspen in 2016, Sildaru became the youngest Winter X Games champion in history, taking gold in the skiing slopestyle competition aged 13. It was no fluke. A year later she became the youngest to retain her title, also finishing on the podium in the big air event.Only a cruciate knee ligament injury sustained in September 2017 prevented the teenager from reaching similarly dizzying heights at the Games in South Korea, where she would have been one of the gold medal favorites. Read MoreSildaru, though, has her feet firmly on the ground. Kelly Sildaru holds aloft her X Games gold medal at Buttermilk Mountain in Aspen, aged 13.\"I think that I've always been a normal kid,\" she tells CNN Sport from her school in Tallinn, despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary. \"Since I won my first X Games, people are watching me when I walk down the street. But I think Estonians are quite shy. They're not coming up to you and taking pictures.\"I think it's quite good to be famous in Estonia \u2014 much easier than in the US.\"Skiing siblingsAs 17-year-old snowboarder Chloe Kim captured hearts around the world at PyeongChang 2018, the world's best female freestyle skier watched on from home. Once you can do doubles with your eyes closed and you don't stress about them anymore, then [a triple] is just one more flip. Kelly Sildaru In a quirk of fate, Sildaru celebrated her 16th birthday on the day the women's Olympic slopestyle competition took place.The Estonian acknowledges it was \"pretty weird\" having to watch on television as the medals were handed out to women she has grown accustomed to beating, but she is wise enough to know that time is on her side.\"Hopefully, my best years are still to come,\" says Sildaru, five months after her surgery as she prepares to return to the slopes.\"I'm so young that I don't want to go back to snow when I'm not ready and injure myself again. I just want to take my time as much as I need and then go back.\"READ: Chloe Kim, America's 17-year-old snowboard sensationFortunately, Sildaru is flanked by two of her closest companions almost everywhere she goes.Her brother Henry, 11, was already on skis before many children have learned to walk. Their father T\u00f5nis quit his job \"four or five years ago\" to facilitate their development and coach full time.  \"It's really nice that I can travel with my family members and not some random people or coaches,\" laughs Sildaru. \"They're very supportive.\"Unsurprisingly, there's a healthy sense of competition between the siblings, with Henry blossoming into an exceptional freestyle skier in his own right. Kelly and Henry Sildaru are no ordinary siblings.\"Oh yeah, we drive each other on all the time,\" says Kelly. \"Every day skiing, we're competing to see who can do a trick better. All the time, everywhere.\"As the elder sibling, Kelly might have grown accustomed to setting the standard, but she is modest enough to admit Henry is hot on her heels. \"We were basically at the same level before I injured myself,\" says Sildaru. \"Now, when I haven't skied for four to five months, I've already seen that Henry is better than me.\"Is he set on dedicating his life to skiing too? \"Yeah, yeah for sure,\" she says. And can they recall a time when they thought of doing anything else? She pauses for thought. \"I don't think we have had it.\"Their father is quick to stress that it is too early to speak of his young son as an elite athlete, due to the \"enormous competition\" among men, but he says \"the flame burns even brighter in Henry.\"You'd think Kelly would be jealous. You'd be wrong.\"Actually, I think I like this. Because when I go back, I can follow him,\" she says. \"Before, it was the other way around. It was a case of, 'I'm going to do something and Henry is going to try and do it better than me.' But now he's going to do it and I'm going to follow. \"Now it's like he's my older brother. He's always been my motivation, but now even more so I guess.\" READ: Meet New Zealand's remarkable skiing sibling quartetIt's a heart-warming sentiment and T\u00f5nis, who describes himself as \"part trainer, teacher, cook, father and cameraman,\" has been there to guide them every step of the way. Kelly acknowledges that the siblings' ambition to push the boundaries of their sport might \"sometimes\" give their father cause for concern. But equally she knows that, however gifted they might be, T\u00f5nis is there protect them, as well as push. A 13-year-old Sildaru flies through the air at the 2016 Winter X Games in Aspen. \"If he thinks we can't do some tricks or jumps, usually he doesn't let us,\" Sildaru explains.Asked if she would ever defy him and attempt a dangerous trick once she's turned 18, Sildaru laughs: \"He's still my coach -- I'm listening to him.\"READ: Why age was just a number at PyeongChang 2018New horizonsShe is already the first female skier to land a switch 1260 degree mute (backwards take off, grabbing the skis in the air) and 1440 degree spin in competition -- both coming in the big air event at the 2017 X Games in Norway.The latter is the trick Sildaru is most proud of, but she's already formulating plans to execute it even better.

When you know how to do doubles, triples shouldn't be very hard.\"To hear a teenager speak so stolidly about pushing the boundaries of her sport is testament to the scale of her ambitions. It's a mentality entwined in the very DNA of extreme sports.  \"All the time, whenever someone does something great or new, we're happy that we're pushing the sport further,\" she says. By the age of nine, Sildaru's mastery of slopestyle rails was among the best on the women's tour.Perhaps the only thing holding Sildaru back at the moment is her size. When she became the youngest ever winner of two X Games gold medals in Aspen last year, she stood just 5 feet 1 inch tall and weighed 88 pounds -- the lightest and shortest in the entire competition.An adult had to push the teenager towards the kicker during her 2017 X Games big air medal-winning run in Norway. \"For me it's always been hard, getting enough speed,\" she admits, having been unable to compete in last year's slopestyle competition for that reason.\"It's always been quite bad, and I think at some point it got worse, because the jumps got bigger but I didn't grow. But now it's getting better I think. I'm gaining weight, or least I'm trying to.\"By the time the next Winter Olympics in Beijing comes around, Sildaru will be turning 20 and eager to make up for lost time. If all goes well, she could go for gold in numerous freestyle skiing events.\"Oh yeah, I really want to,\" she exclaims. \"A few years ago, if I went somewhere for a slopestyle competition and nearby there was a halfpipe competition in the same resort, I'd do both. But I wouldn't travel somewhere only for halfpipe. Now though, when I come back from injury, I'm definitely going to do that.\"Kelly Sildaru, pictured at last year's Winter Games NZ, is increasingly proving her mettle in halfpipe as well as slopestyle.At the most recent FIS Freestyle Junior World Ski Championships, Sildaru won both the slopestyle and halfpipe events by huge margins. Both are Olympic disciplines  Should women's skiing big air be added to the Olympic calendar by 2022 as is touted, Sildaru has a shot at winning three gold medals in a single Winter Games. Estonia, the 158th most populous country in the world, has only won four in its entire history -- all in cross country skiing.

The revised plan, which was issued by the National Crisis Center on Tuesday, sets out a number of safety provisions, focusing in particular on people living within 20 kilometers (about 12 miles) of emergency planning zones surrounding five nuclear sites. Within these zones, which surround sites at Doel, Tihange, Mol-Dessel, Borssele and Chooz (just over the border in France), residents will receive iodine tablets to protect them against radioactive iodine and prevent thyroid cancer in case of a nuclear accident. Elsewhere, the government is stocking pharmacies with iodine tablets to be made freely available to all, with young people under the age of 18 and pregnant women specifically being encouraged to pick up a pack. The emergency zone extends 10 kilometers (about 6 miles) around the Fleurus reactor.The government is also making preparations to swiftly evacuate people living within 10 kilometers of these nuclear sites, as well as encouraging residents to subscribe to the BE-Alert alarm system so they'll get information quickly in case of a nuclear accident.

In 2016, the government revised its 2003 nuclear emergency plan to increase the number of citizens receiving iodine pills.Issues surrounding Belgium's seven nuclear reactors have raised several concerns, with small cracks and reactor pressure flaws being detected in several plants, and Doel 4 being shut down for more than four months in 2014 because of turbine sabotage.Neighboring countries have also expressed concern about Belgium's aging nuclear reactors, and in 2017 German authorities made iodine pills available to all people living in the western city of Aachen, which sits some 70 kilometers (about 43 miles) away from Belgium's Tihange nuclear plant.With continuing debate surrounding a potential life-span extension for some of Belgium's nuclear reactors, the National Crisis Center is commissioning several initiatives to inform citizens and prepare them for a nuclear emergency, including social media campaigns and expert information sessions across the country.",

Quarantines and tariffs?The tripartite agreement between the horse racing authorities in Britain, Ireland and France, which predates Britain's 1973 accession to what was then called the European Economic Community, covers close to 90% of all horse movements within the EU. It allows animals registered in one country to move freely between Europe's top three racing nations, as long as they have a passport and mandatory health certificate. This also includes movement between Ireland, an EU member state, and Northern Ireland, a British province, which effectively operate as one entity in racing. For example, nine out of 10 horses that race in Northern Ireland are trained in the Irish Republic.If no Brexit agreement is reached with Brussels, racehorses may be subject to lengthy and costly veterinary checks at the border, quarantines and even tariffs under World Trade Organization rules, according to Horse Racing Ireland. Horse movements between Ireland, UK and France10,000 horses between the UK and Ireland a year7,000 horses overland between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic5,100 between Ireland and France5,000 between the UK and France(Source: Horse Racing Ireland)It would also mean highly sensitive thoroughbreds trained in Ireland would have to be transported on 24-hour boat trips to mainland Europe, instead of traveling by road to Britain and then making a short journey to cross the English Channel.\"You have to take into account welfare considerations,\" Kavanagh said. \"You don't want a horse stuck in a traffic jam at a port for a few hours, or you don't want a horse having to be pulled off a lorry to be checked and to be examined. \"It is not safe for a pregnant mare to spend 24 hours on a ferry from France to Ireland, so they come overland through the UK. Any barriers to that movement could reduce the incentive to use Irish stallions, and that is a concern.\" One in five of the Top 100 rated flat horses in 2016 were Irish-bred, making it the most successful breeding nation, according to Deloitte. The value of Irish bloodstock exports to the UK is over $300 million per year.JUST WATCHEDSkijoring: One of the wildest sports aroundReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSkijoring: One of the wildest sports around 01:16READ: Female jockeys just as good as men, study reveals'Fundamental change'When asked if Brexit posed a greater challenge to the industry than the 1970s oil crisis or the 2008 global financial crisis, Kavanagh said: \"It's in that league, because it's fundamental. But this one we can have some influence in shaping the outcome of it.\"Kavanagh and his counterparts in Britain and France met with EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in September. \"The difficulty when we met last year was that they said 'Look, we can't talk about new trade arrangements until we are past the divorce phase,'\" Kavanagh said.In December, after Kavanagh's meeting with Barnier, UK Prime Minister Theresa May announced a last-minute deal with the EU aimed at moving Brexit talks to the next phase,  hammering out a transition deal covering a period of up to two years after the UK leaves the EU. One of the key elements in the December deal was the guarantee there will be no so-called \"hard border\" between Northern Ireland and Britain.\"Those [trade] talks haven't started and the clock is ticking,\" Kavanagh said. \"But we did take some heart of some aspects of that announcement. \"The special status of Ireland is to be recognized, and I would argue that the horseracing industry is probably the best example, either in the sporting world or the business world, of integration between Ireland and the UK.\"READ: Brexit breakthrough comes after week of drama'Hopeful' \"Challenges remain, particularly in the event of no deal being reached and the UK becoming a third country the day after leaving the EU, so we are not alone as an industry in respect of welcoming the call for a transition period of up to two years,\" BHA's Mounsey said. \"We are also conscious, though, that we must not lose sight of the opportunities presented by Brexit.\"Although Kavanagh said he was \"hopeful\" of a good Brexit outcome and felt the industry was being listened to both in Brussels and in London, \"the devil will be in the detail.\"Visit CNN.com/horseracing for more news, features and videos \"We've been very lucky with this system, people with great foresight have put that in place,\" he said. \"If we're sensible, we can get some way to overcome that, but again maybe it is naive thinking that nothing will change post-Brexit.\"",

Sergei Skripal, 66, a former Russian military official convicted of spying for the UK, and his daughter, Yulia, 33, who was visiting from Russia, are critically ill in a UK hospital after \"suspected exposure to an unknown substance.\"British counterterrorism police are investigating how the pair ended up slumped on a bench Sunday in  Salisbury, England.Sergei Skripal, here in a Moscow courtroom in 2006, was convicted in Russia of spying for Britain.The incident has not been declared terrorism. But due to the unusual circumstances, the specialized counterterrorism unit will lead the investigation, London's Metropolitan Police said Tuesday. Skripal was convicted in Russia of spying for Britain before being granted refuge in the UK after a high-profile spy swap between the United States and Russia in 2010. Read MoreA forensic tent stands over a bench were Skripal and his daughter were found in Salisbury, England.Salisbury, perhaps best known as the stopping-off point for tourists visiting nearby Stonehenge, has become the unlikely center of an extensive police probe into the mysterious circumstances around how Skripal and his daughter fell ill.The pair were found on a bench in an unremarkable outdoor shopping complex, surrounded by a handful of chain eateries, including the Italian restaurant Zizzi, which was closed as part of the inquiry. They did not have any visible injuries, according to police. Yulia Skripal  is thought to be one of the few members of the former spy's immediate family still alive. Images taken outside the restaurant Monday night showed investigators in anti-contamination suits searching the premises. Authorities have declined to name the substance to which the pair were exposed.A small number of emergency services personnel were treated immediately afterward, local police said Tuesday. One of them remains in the hospital. Investigators leave the park bench in Salibury covered with a forensic tent Tuesday.Salisbury resident Freya Church described seeing the pair on the bench appearing \"out of it.\"\"She sort of leant in on him, it looked like she'd passed out maybe. He was doing some strange hand movements, looking up to the sky,\" Church told Reuters on Monday.\"I felt like I should step in but to be honest they looked so out of it that I thought that even if I did step in I wasn't sure how I would help. So yeah, I just left them, but it looked like they'd been taking something quite strong.\"An officer stands outside the nearby Zizzi restaurant, which was closed Tuesday.By Tuesday morning, the bench had been covered in a white forensic tent, a light drizzle of rain falling on reporters gathered at the scene.The case has drawn comparisons to the poisoning of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, who died a slow death after drinking tea laced with highly radioactive polonium-210 in a Mayfair hotel of London in 2006.A detailed UK inquiry later concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin probably approved the operation by Russian agents to kill Litvinenko. The Russian Foreign Ministry dismissed the UK investigation as politically motivated. In a conference call with reporters Tuesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on the Skripal case, saying \"we do not have any information\" about the situation, and adding that he did not know whether Skripal still had Russian citizenship.       UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Tuesday the Skripal case had \"echoes\" of what happened to Litvinenko. While he stopped short of \"pointing fingers\" of responsibility, Johnson said during a Parliament session that the UK would act robustly if \"evidence emerges of state responsibility.\" He then suggested the UK's participation in this summer's World Cup in Russia could potentially be affected. \"I think it will be very difficult to imagine that UK representation at that event could go ahead in the normal way, and we will certainly have to consider that,\" Johnson said. A UK Foreign Office representative later clarified those comments, stating that Johnson was referring to the UK's diplomatic representation at the event, rather than its soccer team.The Russian Embassy in London hit back at Johnson's remarks, saying it \"looks like the script of yet another anti-Russian campaign has already been written.\"In a statement, the embassy said it was \"impressed\" by Johnson's comments in Parliament, saying he spoke \"in such a manner as if the investigation was already over and Russia was found responsible for what had happened in Salisbury.\"\"We regret that instead of a proper official clarification on the issue the foreign secretary chose to threaten Russia with retribution,\" it read.Who is Sergei Skripal?Skripal arrived in the UK as part of an elaborately choreographed spy swap conducted by the United States and Russia in which the two countries exchanged agents on chartered planes on the runway at an airport in Vienna, Austria.Among the 10 so-called Russian sleeper agents deported by the United States as part of the deal was Anna Chapman, who had previously lived in London. Anna Chapman was among the 10 so-called Russian sleeper agents.Skripal was one of four Russians who traveled in the opposite direction after then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev pardoned him.According to previous reports by Russia's state news agency RIA Novosti, Skripal was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2006 for spying for the UK.It quoted Russia's Federal Security Service, or FSB, as saying Skripal, a former Russian military intelligence colonel, was convicted for \"treason in the form of espionage\" and that he had been recruited by Britain's MI6 intelligence service.The report said he had spied for Britain as an intelligence officer during the 1990s and he had continued to communicate with MI6 after his retirement in 1999.Russian court officials said Skripal had received at least $100,000 for his collaboration with MI6, RIA Novosti reported.Police officers stand outside Sergei Skripal's home in Salisbury.\n According to the FSB, Skripal's \"actions caused serious damage to the national defense and security.\" The intelligence service added that MI6 paid Skripal for the information in foreign currency, which was transferred monthly to his account in a Spanish bank.Russian newspaper reports at the time of his conviction said Skripal had shared information about dozens of his former colleagues operating undercover in Europe, in particular their secret meeting venues, addresses and passwords.The FSB said that Skripal had admitted his guilt and gave truthful testimony about his activities, which the court had taken into consideration in sentencing him.Skripal is believed to have lived in the UK since his release from Russian custody in 2010. Skripal's daughter is thought to be one of the few members of his immediate family still alive after his wife, Lyudmila, and son Alexander died in recent years.

She said a new law would be presented to Council of Ministers -- France's equivalent of a cabinet -- on March 21.In France, current laws criminalize sex with children under the age of 15 but prosecutors must prove that the sexual act was forced.Two cases involving the 11-year-old girls provoked outrage in France after the alleged perpetrators were acquitted of rape.In November a 30-year-old man was cleared of rape after the court found that the victim had not been subjected to \"constraint, threat, violence or surprise.\"Read MoreIn the other case, charges against a 28-year-old man, also accused of raping an 11-year-old girl, were downgraded to \"sexual relations with a minor,\" according to French news agency AFP.

        "content": "Rome (CNN)Few cities in the world bear the scars of such a tumultuous past as the ancient city of Rome. It has been sacked by the Gauls and the Goths, by the French and the Fascists, with each invader leaving a layer of history that adds to its complexity. But lately, the city has fallen victim to a different kind of threat -- that of indifference and questionable city governments that have left its grandeur dirty and decaying.The mosaics and frescoes are still safe within the fortified walls of the great palaces and museums, but it is far more likely that any recent visitor will instead remember the graffiti and the garbage spilling over onto the cobblestone streets. Buses don't run on time and frequent labor union disputes lead to strikes that shut down public transportation altogether.Rome has been suffering from a chronic rubbish collection issue since Christmas Eve.So dire is the situation that a group of city activists who work under the banner \"Roma Fa Schifo\" (Rome is Disgusting) chronicle the degradation on a website and Twitter feed with more than 150,000 followers.This city is also lately filled with migrants who suffer from a recent backlash that is pushing right-wing anti-immigration parties to the forefront ahead of Sunday's elections. Read MoreRome has no official center for migrants waiting for word on their political asylum requests, so many camp out near the main train station or settle in any number of shanty towns that have sprung up along the banks of the city's Tiber River. In January, CNN visited an abandoned multi-story university building known to its inhabitants as the Selam Palace, where nearly 1,000 Ethiopian, Eritrean and Somali refugees who have been granted legal refugee status squat illegally because the city can't find legitimate housing. There are more than 50 other abandoned office buildings just like it throughout the city. Migrants warm up around a fire at a makeshift camp in Rome in February.Donatella D'Angelo, a medical doctor with a nongovernmental organization called Cittadini Del Mondo (Citizens of the World), visits the center once a week to provide basic health care. \"It is unthinkable that a European capital treats refugees and migrants like this,\" she told CNN while volunteers cobbled together wires with duct tape so she had enough light to treat patients. \"This is Rome? This is the best we can do?\"A frozen cityOn Monday morning, a dusting of snow brought the city to a complete standstill, closing schools for two full days and paralyzing traffic. The city's buses had to be called back to the depot after it was confirmed that the city government had apparently overlooked funding for all-weather tires.Romans trudge through the snow in St. Peter's Square on Monday. The last time it snowed, in 2012, a similar fiasco ensued when it was discovered that the snow blades meant to be clipped on to garbage collection trucks were the wrong size. It was soon apparent that promises to fix that problem had been forgotten when the army had to be called in to remove the slushy snow from the streets to try to get the buses running again. The snow blades are still rusting in an abandoned parking lot near the Baths of Caracalla.Those businesses that did open had to resort to using table salt to keep their clients from slipping in the slush. With an absence of snow shovels or city clean-up crews, workers used anything they could find, from serving trays to pieces of cardboard, to clean the sidewalks. Berlusconi: Facing a new crisis, Italians turn to an old warhorseSeveral trees that had not been properly pruned and trimmed last autumn collapsed under the weight of the snow, one falling next to children throwing snowballs in a park in the neighborhood of Testaccio near the city center. Another untrimmed tree fell onto a light rail line near Rome's ancient Aurelian walls, blocking what had been the only means of above-ground public transportation in the entire city. Melting snow turned subway stairs into waterfalls, and the average wait for trains out of Rome while crews worked to clear the tracks was just over two hours. Romans did as they always do, just shrugging it off and meeting for coffee to complain, which is a favorite, and often justifiable, pastime. A group of older men sitting in the Linari coffee bar in Testaccio argued Monday morning about solutions for the mess Rome finds itself in. \"Mussolini would have had these streets clean by now,\" said one man as he sipped a creamy cappuccino. \"We need order in this country again, a stronger hand to put things back in place.\" Blame game continuesIn fact, much of the blame for Rome's current state of disrepair has been cast on Mayor Virginia Raggi, the first female ever to lead the eternal city, and the first member of the maverick Five Star Movement (M5S) political party to be given charge of such an important municipality. Virginia Raggi was criticized for being in Mexico during this week's storm.  When the snow fell on Monday, she was ridiculed for being in Mexico for talks about climate change. She certainly couldn't have foreseen the inclement weather, but she is being blamed for not having the measures in place just in case. Criticism against her and her party trended all day. The populist M5S is polling ahead of all the other single parties ahead of the upcoming elections. The party has previously ruled out forming a coalition, which makes it unlikely that it can attain power, although it has suggested in recent days that it may have changed its stance. Why Italy's unpredictable election is testing nerves in Europe Its charismatic leader, 31-year-old Luigi Di Maio, a former waiter with scant government experience, believes that M5S could still pull off a surprise victory when it becomes apparent to voters that the alternatives are a right-wing coalition led by Silvio Berlusconi that includes neo-fascist parties, or the largely divided center-left. Raggi won Rome, in part, on the promise to rid the city of corruption, a mantra of the party first introduced by M5S founder and comedian Beppe Grillo, who vowed to rid Parliament of criminals. Never mind that several of Raggi's cabinet members have so far had to resign amid accusations of the very corruption she is supposed to be fighting, and that the mayor herself is under investigation for abuse of office and giving false testimony in the investigation of one of her associates. Raggi denies the allegations, but her record as mayor has given ammunition to some M5S opponents who say the anti-corruption party is no better than anyone else, and that its record in Rome proves it is not ready or able to lead. Luigi Di Maio (L) jokes with M5S founders Beppe Grillo (hidden) and Davide Casaleggio (R) in January.But Raggi is not the first troubled Roman mayor. Her predecessor, Ignazio Marino, a member of the center-left Democratic Party, resigned in shame after being investigated for embezzlement, fraud and forgery tied to an expense receipt scandal -- charges first lodged by the Five Star Movement party. He was eventually cleared.Before him, Rome's mayor was Gianni Alemanno, a member of Berlusconi's center-right Forza Italia party, who was tried for Mafia collusion after it was alleged he accepted more than 125,000 euros ($152,280) from mobster Salvatore Buzzi, the leader of the so-called Mafia Capitale organized-crime ring. Alemanno was eventually cleared, too, but the scandals clearly took their toll on the city. Terminal decline?Buzzi, along with Massimo Carminati and nearly 40 others, was found guilty and sentenced to prison in 2017 for pocketing public-works money from Rome's coffers for years. But when the criminal network was dismantled, the city fell apart. The contracts for waste management had to be reissued, and proved too expensive for legitimate companies to carry out the work for the same price the mob-related companies had, creating a garbage crisis in many Roman neighborhoods.The commissioner of the city bus company was also forced to resign, which has caused a variety of problems. The new commissioner requires bus drivers to punch a time clock and be accountable, and many drivers took part in strikes and drove their routes very slowly in protest. A worker with the municipal rubbish collection company cleans the floors of the Trevi Fountain in August 2016.The vacuum created by cleaning up the mafia mess contributed to the sad state of the Italian capital today. And in many ways, Rome was nearly ruined by attempts to save it.\"Rome has suffered from being an ideological showcase,\" Matthew Kneale, a historian and author of Rome: A History in Seven Sackings, told CNN. \"Popes, emperors, the kings, Mussolini -- they all wanted to use it to display their ideology. Now it is less about the architecture, but it is still a trophy to be fought over to show ideological supremacy.\"Kneale said that because Rome is largely a parasitical city, reaping the benefits of its past for more than 2,000 years rather than carving out a sustainable future, its success or failure surely cannot be an accurate measure of anyone's ability to govern.\"Rome has quite a long standing history of corruption,\" he says. \"Rome's extraordinary past, that has made it a center of pilgrimage, tourism and government, has allowed it to survive despite some wholly and often corrupt inept rulers.\"",

        "content": "Rome (CNN)As the dust settles on Italy's national election, there are clear winners and losers, but no clear outcome after a divisive campaign dominated by anti-immigrant rhetoric and promises that will be hard to keep.As the first exit polls were released shortly before midnight Sunday, a wave of disbelief turned to unbridled enthusiasm at the headquarters of the Five Star Movement (M5S) in the green-carpeted basement of the luxury Parco dei Principi hotel in central Rome. The party was on the top of every exit poll and looked set to claim almost a third of votes, the largest of any single party, and some 14 percentage points more than anyone else. Italy's voters choose populists, deliver stinging rebuke to EuropeLuigi di Maio, the young leader of the anti-establishment party founded by former comedian Beppe Grillo, didn't speak publicly on Sunday, but he was photographed by party faithful with an ear-to-ear grin hugging everyone who came anywhere near him. Di Maio, at just 31, has come to symbolize youth discontent in Italy, campaigning along a fine line between hope and fear, using words like \"us\" and \"them,\" and referring to potential voters as \"my generation.\" In a blog post before the vote, he wrote, \"They look at us because we are the future of the country, but they still do not trust us completely.\"M5S may have very well won the hearts of young and disgruntled voters, but it is still a long way from winning power in Italy if the movement stays true to its grassroots. Because M5S campaigned on a promise of independence and transparency, it is unlikely to join a coalition. Di Maio has flirted with the idea of forming a coalition before, but the \"Grillini,\" as Five Star supporters are called, have so far balked at the idea. Five Star Movement leader Luigi di Maio (R) waves to supporters at a rally with party founder Beppe Grillo (L) in Rome on Friday.Read More\"The Five Star's new mantra should be that it is impossible and unlawful [to form] any majority without us,\" said Jacopo Iacoboni, a leading political analyst with La Stampa newspaper. \"That is to say, nobody can try to exclude [them] from the big game now.\" League ascendantLeague leader Matteo Salvini gestures to supporters as he arrives at party headquarters in Milan on Monday.M5S isn't the only party celebrating. Matteo Salvini, the 44-year-old leader of the populist and xenophobic League -- formerly known as the Northern League -- tweeted \"Grazie\" to his voters just before midnight as he watched his party climb to the second rung in early exit polls. The latest tally on Monday morning put the League at around 17.5% of the vote, but there are still uncounted ballots. The League went into the election as a junior partner in a center-right coalition that also includes Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party and the neo-fascist Brothers of Italy party. But as the votes were counted, Salvini looked likely to emerge in the driver's seat. Forza Italia underperformed, and is set to come in several points behind the League at around 14%, according to the Interior Ministry.Berlusconi, once a kingmaker, is now something of a political pauper. The former Prime Minister told voters that the reason his party fell short was that he was not the actual candidate, having been banned from office until 2019 for tax fraud. Berlusconi had hoped to guide the center-right coalition, installing Antonio Tajani as Prime Minister until sweeping back into power next year. Former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's party had a disappointing night at the polls.Now, Berlusconi has been relegated to Salvini's whims. On Monday, Salvini told reporters that he himself would lead the center-right coalition. \"Millions of Italians asked us to lead them out of uncertainty,\" he said. \"We will lead them. I see this as a vote for the future, not the past.\"Salvini, who once took a bulldozer to a Roma camp and introduced legislation for \"Italian only\" segregated buses, reinvented himself in this electoral campaign. He has lately steered his party toward a more centrist approach. Salvini is a staunch supporter of US President Donald Trump, traveling to a campaign rally in Philadelphia in 2016 and posing with the then-presidential candidate. Salvini campaigned under an \"Italy First\" banner, clearly borrowing from one of Trump's favorite catchphrases. Late campaigning by the Five Star Movement in the southern regions of Italy borrowed a page from the American film \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\" and used three red billboards to remind voters there how Salvini used to refer to them. \"I said you stink,\" said one. \"Now I want your vote,\" said another. The third simply stated, \"Why not, peasants?\"The center-left Democratic Party under the joint stewardship of former premier Matteo Renzi and Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni was the undisputed loser in Sunday's polling. The party appeared to have gained only around 19% of the overall vote, and its center-left coalition around 23% in total. They will win a few more points based on a new electoral law that gives leading coalition members the percentage points of those parties that win less than 3%, but it won't be enough to make a difference. Berluconi reportedly met Matteo Renzi, pictured, for talks on Sunday night.Berlusconi and Renzi reportedly met late Sunday for what now seem like desperation talks. Even if they cobbled together some sort of new centrist compromise coalition, they surely would never be able to solidify enough percentage points to form a majority. Now the ball is in President Sergio Mattarella's court. Once the votes are certified, likely late Monday, he will start meeting with the winners to begin what are expected to be tense and tedious negotiations after such a vitriolic campaign. Italians are watching to see who he meets with first. \"Will italian president Sergio Mattarella give responsibility to form a government to Mr Salvini (first coalition) or Mr Di Maio (first party)?\" tweeted La Stampa's Iacoboni. \"In any case, it will be very tough to avoid a populist, more or less eurosceptic, and more or less anti-migrant leader.\" That sentiment is one everyone seems to agree on. Writing in the widely respected newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano, political commentator and author Marco Travaglio summed it up: \"The Italians braved cold temperatures to vote under a demented electoral law to scream a giant, supersonic 'F...You' to the ancient regime.\" Change, it seems, is the only certainty.",

Like many other sports, golf has struggled to emerge from under cricket's shadow -- although there are many similarities between the two sports.  The British Raj introduced both during its rule over India from 1858 to 1947.  There's the cadence to compare, the time between shots being hit; and also the hand-eye coordination between bat, or club, and ball.  Few know more about the parallels between both sports than cricketing legend Kapil Dev, who is the only player in history to have taken more than 400 wickets and scored over 5,000 test runs.JUST WATCHEDGolf in India: The growth of the gameReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHGolf in India: The growth of the game 22:29READ: Garcia wins breakthrough award, 18 years after his firstRead MoreNow, 59-years-old and a single figure handicap golfer, Dev has represented India in a number of senior amateur golf tournaments. During a recent round with CNN Living Golf's Shane O'Donoghue at Delhi Golf Club, Kapil compared his two sporting passions. ''When you play cricket you're always depending on somebody. In golf it's up to you,\" he told CNN. \"You can feel proud about the shot you play, you play a bad shot you really can't criticize anybody.''I feel happy to have represented two sports for my country. When I was 12 I didn't realize the importance of playing cricket for India. Then I picked up golf at the age of 37 and then you represent your country again it feels great.''In 1983, Kapil captained India to an historic World Cup victory over the West Indies, taking the popularity of cricket in his country to an even higher level.JUST WATCHEDThomas Bjorn: Europe's Ryder Cup captainReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThomas Bjorn: Europe's Ryder Cup captain 06:00READ: A Dane's date with destinyDev knows that golf faces an uphill task to ever compete with India's most beloved sport. ''It's very difficult because golf needs land, almost a minimum of 150 acres of land to play,'' he explains. ''With cricket you can play in the backyard, you can play in the streets, you can play anywhere. But I have noticed a difference. \"Now if you want to play on Saturday or Sunday at Delhi Golf Club you have to book a week in advance. That's the change in the game of golf. If more youngsters start playing golf in India the game could be huge.''Dev has also noticed how more young Indians now view sport as a possible profession compared to when he was growing up.

        "content": "London (CNN)In the post-Lance Armstrong world of cycling, Bradley Wiggins and Team Sky branded themselves as being at the vanguard of the sport's anti-doping movement. Fast forward to Monday and a British Parliamentary report has accused 2012 Tour de France winner Wiggins and the British cycling team of crossing an \"ethical line\" over anti-doping rules.Follow @cnnsport\n\nThe 52-page report, which was compiled by the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee, alleges Team Sky used drugs allowed under anti-doping rules \"to enhance the performances of riders, and not just to treat medical need.\"Briton Wiggins, who is now 37, has strenuously denied the allegations outlined against him in the report, as has Team Sky, which built its reputation on a zero tolerance approach to doping. Wiggins was that rare breed of rider, who excelled both in track and road cycling. As well as his 2012 Tour win, across five Olympics he bagged a total of eight medals, five of those being prized gold.Read MoreThe report claims Wiggins used the anti-inflammatory drug triamcinolone in preparation for the 2012 Tour de France race -- cycling's most prestigious event -- which the Briton won.A section of the report alleges Wiggins received an injection of corticosteroid triamcinolone by Team Sky doctor Richard Freeman on the final day of the Criterium du Dauphine race in June 2011.The DCMS reports adds that Freeman had refused to give evidence to the committee while being \"the only reported source of this information.\" CNN was not immediately able to reach Freeman for comment.Bradley Wiggins won give Olympic golds during his career.According to the DCMS report regarding the 2011 incident \"there was no TUE in place for Wiggins to permit its use at that time.\"The report adds that there was an application for a TUE, dated 30 May 2011, to allow Wiggins to use triamcinolone submitted to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) , but it wasn't granted until June 26, 2011.Triamcinolone is prohibited in competition under WADA rules unless a TUE is issued. But the drug is permitted outside of competition.The Criterium du Dauphine started on June 5 and ended on June 12.In 2016, it was revealed that Wiggins, who suffers with asthma and retired in December of that year, was given three TUEs to use triamcinolone before the Tour de France in 2011 and 2012 as well as the 2013 Giro d'Italia.The news came after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was hacked by Russian hackers, Fancy Bear.Wiggins retired from cycling in December 2016.Wiggins and his boss at Team Sky, Dave Brailsford, have always insisted that the five-time Olympic champion was given triamcinolone to treat asthma.But the committee disputes the explanation offered by Team Sky, saying it has received \"confidential material from a well-placed and respected source,\" who described how the drug was used to make athletes leaner and more powerful.'Ethical line'Instead, it accuses the team of abusing the TUE system, which enables athletes to use a prohibited substance for the treatment of a legitimate medical condition.When athletes can take drugs. What are Therapeutic Use Exemptions?\"We believe that this powerful corticosteroid was being used to prepare Bradley Wiggins, and possibly other riders supporting him, for the Tour de France,\" it said.\"The purpose of this was not to treat medical need, but to improve his power-to-weight ratio ahead of the race.\"The application for the TUE ... also meant that he benefited from the performance-enhancing properties of this drug during the race.\"This does not constitute a violation of the WADA code, but it does cross the ethical line that David Brailsford says he himself drew for Team Sky.\"The report also stated that the source had informed them that Wiggins and a \"smaller group of riders\" trained separately from the team in 2012 and were all \"using corticosteroids out of competition to lean down in preparation for the major races\".'Ethical gray areas'Speaking to CNN Monday Damian Collins, the British lawmaker who chaired the committee, urged for more clarity over sport's \"ethical gray areas.\"\"I think one of the issues people would right struggle to understand is why is it we have these ethical gray areas in sport where medicines are used -- and they can be used to treat a medical need but also have known performance enhancing properties?\" Collins said.\"Why is it that people can take medication in that way and gain a competitive edge from it? I think most people would say, 'well, that shouldn't be allowed' and therefore we should look to redraw the rules around the use of medicines in sport so that medication that is used to treat a medical need shouldn't also have performance enhancing properties.\"If a patient is so sick that they genuinely require that treatment, they shouldn't be able to compete whilst benefiting from that drug.\"Collins said the DCMS report was \"not just based on the evidence of one person -- be that anonymous or on the record, but a variety of evidence we collected, both written and oral evidence.\"He added:\" One of the key people that gave evidence on the record and addressed the key question around the ethics of drug use was Shane Sutton, Bradley Wiggins' coach at the time. \"So, people can read for themselves the evidence we gathered, both identifying the use of the drug, the amount of the drug the team ordered and used and people's comments on who they believe that drug was for.\"'Put my side across'I find it so sad that accusations can be made, where people can be accused of things they have never done which are then regarded as facts. I strongly refute the claim that any drug was used without medical need. I hope to have my say in the next few days & put my side across.\u2014 Brad Wiggins (@SirWiggo) March 5, 2018\n\nIn a tweet late Sunday, Wiggins said: \"I find it so sad that accusations can be made, where people can be accused of things they have never done which are then regarded as facts.\"He added: \"I strongly refute the claim that any drug was used without medical need. I hope to have my say in the next few days and & put my side across.\"Bradley Wiggins won the 2012 Tour de France.Team Sky also rejected the allegations in the report.\"The report also makes the serious claim that medication has been used by the Team to enhance performance. We strongly refute this,\" Team Sky said in a statement.\"The report also includes an allegation of widespread triamcinolone use by Team Sky riders ahead of the 2012 Tour de France.\"Again, we strongly refute this allegation. We are surprised and disappointed that the Committee has chosen to present an anonymous and potentially malicious claim in this way, without presenting any evidence or giving us an opportunity to respond.\"This is unfair both to the Team and to the riders in question.\"In a statement, British Cycling said it welcomed the report, while confirming that Freeman was under investigation by the General Medical Council.it also said that it shared the Parliamentary Committee's concerns with regards to TUEs.\"Medical treatment of any kind should only be used to address clinical need and never to enhance performance,\" British Cycling CEO Julie Harrington said in a statement.'Jiffy bag'Much attention in the DCMS report is given to a \"jiffy bag\" which was delivered to Wiggins and Team Sky during the 2011 Criterium du Dauphine.Wiggins has rejected all the allegations against him.The incident was investigated by UK Anti-Doping (UKAD), which concluded it could not determine whether the package contained the legal decongestant fluimucil, as claimed by Wiggins and Brailsford, or the corticosteroid triamcinolone, or something else.What was in that bag has never been proven. Former Team Sky doctor Freeman failed to share his records with colleagues. He said he also lost his laptop, which contained Wiggins' medical records, while on holiday in Greece.In December 2016, Brailsford told a DCMS hearing that Freeman, who was the team's doctor at the time, told him the bag contained fluimucil which is a legal decongestant.But this latest report said it had \"no verifiable evidence\" that it was fluimucil in the package, adding that Freeman had refused to give evidence to the committee.Team SkyThe latest revelations are a further blow for Team Sky after its four-time Tour de France champion Chris Froome failed a drugs test in September.Chris Froome: Tour de France champion failed a drug testFroome was found to have double the allowed level of legal asthma drug Salbutamol in his urine test on September 7 during the Vuelta a Espana, which he went on to win.The levels of the drug in Froome's urine test were at 2,000 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) -- double WADA's 1,000 ng/ml threshold.Froome has denied any wrongdoing and pledged to cooperate fully with an investigation.",

        "content": "(CNN)Italy's election result is yet another sign of popular resentments -- against conventional politicians, the forces of globalization, immigration and the European \"project.\" It wasn't just the success of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S). Another party that surpassed expectations was the far-right League -- formerly the Northern League -- which did better than the center-right Forza Italia. The center-left coalition only managed around 22% and looks set to be the third-largest group in parliament behind the right-wing bloc and M5S. In short, the center withered while populism thrived. Italy's voters choose populists, deliver stinging rebuke to EuropeThe result \"will make for complex, unpredictable and lengthy coalition negotiations, which are likely to last well into spring,\" according to Federico Santi at the Eurasia Group. And stable government will depend on the maverick M5S, which will be the largest party in parliament.  Prolonged upheaval and uncertainty may jeopardize Italy's gradual recovery (growth was 1.5% in 2017, and for Italy, that's success) and increase its borrowing costs. Italians simply didn't feel times are getting better, despite four years of GDP growth. Unemployment is still close to 11%, with youth unemployment some 32%; productivity is poor by the standards of the Group of Seven countries. Read MoreThe populist parties had a ready audience for their message. They accused Brussels of forcing reforms in Italy that make hiring and firing easier. Both M5S and the League had previously cast doubt on Italy's membership of the eurozone, though more recently they softened that stance. They have expressed hostility to Europe's major trade agreements with Japan and Canada. Many Italians blame the collapse of small and medium enterprises on unfair competition from Asia and elsewhere.Tariff talkMatteo Salvini's League party rode the wave of anti-establishment sentiment.Matteo Salvini, leader of the League, was rare among European politicians in welcoming US President Donald Trump's sudden announcement of tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum last week. \"If Italians will choose me as Prime Minister I will [impose tariffs] like Trump. I will defend Italian workers and entrepreneurs, even if it means putting up tariffs to protect the 'made in Italy' brand,\" Salvini said. The Five Star Movement's promise of a guaranteed minimum income for the poor also struck a chord. Italy's National Statistics Institute reported last autumn that while the top 20% of Italians had enjoyed the fruits of recent growth, the bottom 30% faced \"poverty and social exclusion.\" The percentage of Italians living in poverty rose to 20.6% in 2016.  Much of that poverty is in the south, where Five Star won 65 out of 80 districts, according to preliminary data from the Interior Ministry.Even if just a few of the promises made are delivered, that's very probably bad news for Italy's budget deficit and its national debt, which is a dizzying 130% of GDP. Given the size of the Italian economy -- the third-largest in continental Europe -- a surge in borrowing costs could quickly spook the markets and recall the days of the \"PIGS\" (Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain) in 2008 when several European economies looked like they would sink. Anxiety in BrusselsFor the European Union, the Italian election result is yet another headache. No sooner had the long-running German coalition negotiations finally been resolved (nearly six months after the election) than a new political crisis erupted in another major EU state -- one that might unstitch a painstaking recovery there and further afield.The leader of the French National Front, Marine le Pen, congratulated Salvini and said that the European Union was about to have \"a bad night.\"The EU is confronted with some tough decisions in the coming months. It is threatening to retaliate if the Trump administration proceeds with tariffs on steel and aluminum imports; the Brexit negotiations are approaching a critical moment; and the EU has to agree on a common position on any changes to the nuclear deal with Iran as demanded by Washington. Meanwhile, tough budget negotiations are getting underway. But after the Italian result, France and Germany are the only heavy hitters embracing further European integration and a deepening of the eurozone. Goodbye social democracy?The pro-Europe social democratic model that has been part of the European landscape since 1945 has suffered one setback after another in recent years. In the UK, the main opposition Labour Party has swung to the left under Jeremy Corbyn, abandoning Tony Blair's \"Third Way.\"The Social Democratic Party in Germany has accepted a junior role in the new German coalition in part because it risked hideous losses in fresh elections, if polls were accurate. The party of Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt was barely keeping up with the far-right Alternative for Germany.The Socialist party in Spain has lost ground to the insurgent Podemos, an anti-establishment party on the left, and is now in third place in most polls.Italy's election brings clear winners and losers, but no clear outcomeThe French Socialist party was obliterated in the presidential and parliamentary elections last year. In 2012 it had a majority in the National Assembly; its candidate for the presidency in 2017 received 6% of the vote.In the Netherlands the Labor Party, often a senior partner in post-war coalitions, won less than 6% of the vote last year. Austria's Social Democrats, in office for all but 11 years since 1945, are now in opposition to a right-wing coalition government. At the same time, Poland and Hungary have populist right-wing governments that are hostile to EU policies on migration. Poland is also at loggerheads with the European Commission over controversial changes to its justice system. The center-left parties of Europe have withered or changed for a variety of reasons -- but there are common themes. Their traditional base, lower-paid and less-skilled workers, feel unprotected from what they see as the onslaught of immigration and globalization, growing inequality and the loss of jobs through automation. Many millions of them have protested at the ballot box -- in the Brexit vote and in elections across Europe. Italians have now joined the procession.",

        "content": "(CNN)Italy was plunged into political uncertainty Monday after parliamentary elections delivered victories for populist, euroskeptic parties but left no clear path forward for a new government. No party or coalition received enough votes to rule alone, and Italy now faces a hung parliament, in what European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker described last month as the \"worst-case scenario\" for Europe.  With nearly all votes counted Monday night, 50% of voters showed support for populist or right-wing parties. The anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) become the largest single party in parliament with roughly 32.7% of the vote, according to Italy's Interior Ministry, although it will not have enough seats for an outright majority.A right-wing coalition of parties won the most seats of any bloc in parliament with about 37% of the vote. The big winner in that group was the anti-immigrant and xenophobic League -- formerly the Northern League -- which garnered more votes than the center-right Forza Italia, its potential coalition partner. The result will be met with alarm by European leaders who feared that big wins for Italy's anti-establishment parties would spell further trouble for a continent already struggling to cope with the destabilizing rise of populist and far-right movements in France, Germany and elsewhere. Read MoreKey takeawaysM5S leader Luigi Di Maio (R) and party founder Beppe Grillo (L) attend the party's final rally last Friday.  The right-wing coalition cobbled together by Silvio Berlusconi won the most combined votes at 37%, but the League came out on top of the bloc, winning roughly 17.4% of the votes to Forza Italia's 14%. The swing toward the League, led by Matteo Salvini, looks set to give the party as many as 123 seats in the lower house, up from 22 seats, an almost six-fold increase.Berlusconi's Forza Italia party fared worse than expected, and the former prime minister appears to have failed in his attempt to position himself as the election's kingmaker.With around 32.7% of the vote, M5S outperformed final opinion polls. The party dominated in the south of Italy, receiving almost one in two votes in a region where youth unemployment is historically high.Italy's center-left coalition had a bad night, mustering about 23% of the vote. It is likely to end up as the third-largest group in parliament behind the right-wing coalition and M5S.Italy looks set to enter a period of political deadlock -- facing weeks, if not months, of negotiations between groups with competing interests to form a government.Former Prime Minister and Democratic Party leader Matteo Renzi stepped down from his role after it suffered a worse than expected performance.Berlusconi eclipsed by allySalvini gives a thumb's up at League headquarters in Milan on Monday morning. As the results continued to be counted earlier in the day, the League's Salvini claimed victory during a press conference in Rome on Monday morning that will have set alarm bills ringing at European Union headquarters in Brussels.\"I have always said, I say now and I will always say that the euro is the wrong currency, and that it was a big mistake getting in it,\" Salvini announced. \"We have it very clear that the common currency is bound to end. And we want to come prepared to that moment.\"\"We look towards the other European forces, that they call populist. I am and I will stay proudly populist, because the populists listen to the people, unlike the 'radical chic' that despise the workers and don't do their groceries, \" Salvini said.  Though the right-wing bloc did not win enough votes to form a majority government, Salvini claimed \"an extraordinary victory.\" \"This is the coalition that won, this is the coalition that will govern. The arrogance of [former Prime Minister Matteo] Renzi and his allies has been punished.\"Fabio Bordignon, a political scientist at the University of Urbino Carlo Bo, interpreted the populist parties' strong performance as \"a reflection of a strong political and economic malaise that affects Italy.\"Italians have becoming increasingly frustrated after years of unprecedented migration and continued economic woes. Seizing on this dissatisfaction, right-wing parties had touted an anti-immigration agenda, with the League pledging to put \"Italians first\" and advocating for mass expulsions.Bordignon added: \"[The early results] are also a demonstration that that malaise cannot be cured by building defensive barriers against populism ... The choice for the Five Star is no longer only a protest vote.\"Stellar rise of M5S But political scientist Paolo Chiocchetti said M5S would be central to the coming negotiations after it exceeded expectations.\"The big and only winners of the night are the Five Star Movement and the Lega (the League),\" Chiocchetti, fellow of the Robert Schuman Institute of European Affairs at the University of Luxembourg, told CNN. \"Their rise was widely expected given the general anti-incumbency trend in Europe and the particularly harsh effect of the great recession and of austerity in Italy, whose current recovery is extremely feeble. However, they both exceeded the expectations.\"The Five Star Movement had campaigned for a universal basic income, a measure especially popular in the south, where the unemployment rate, at almost 20%, is more than three times as high as in the north, according to the Italian National Bureau of Statistics (ISTAT).  It appears this was a winning strategy as early projections indicated M5S had dominated the region. Minutes after Salvini spoke, rival party leader Luigi Di Maio claimed M5S were the \"absolute winners of the election,\" before adding that the party was \"open to talks with other parties\" to form a government. \"Other coalitions have no numbers to govern... So we take this responsibility,\" Di Maio said. Bad day for ruling partyThe disappointing performance of the governing center-left Democratic Party (PD) was captured in Italian newspaper headlines. One read \"Italy belongs to Five Stars. PD sinks\"; another read \"Di Maio wins, Italy is ungovernable.\"Although the PD is projected to have won second-most votes at about 18.7%, its center-left coalition, formed with the liberal More Europe party, could muster just short of a combined 23% and will likely end up as the third-largest group in parliament behind the right-wing coalition and M5S. PD Leader Matteo Renzi stepped down from his role after it suffered a worse than expected performance. Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Renzi said that the party's place in government is now in opposition.PD member and outgoing parliamentarian Andrea Marcucci said that the voters had spoken \"clearly and incontrovertibly\" and that \"the populists had won and the (Democratic Party) had lost.\" \"The Democratic Party is leaving much better results to Italy than its predecessors. We will start again in the opposition,\" he said in the post.Bad news for EU unityThe poll is being closely scrutinized by European leaders who are concerned by the increasingly euroskeptic sentiment on the continent and fearful of any instability in Italy, the eurozone's third-largest economy and one of the founding members of the European Union. The rise of anti-European voices, both on the right and from the anti-establishment M5S, comes as Italians appear increasingly divided over issues such as undocumented immigration, which contributed to a rancorous campaign.

By 7pm local time, the turnout was 58.5%, compared to 46.3% the last time Italy held general elections in 2013, although then the electorate had two days to vote.Changes to the election system to prevent fraud also meant long queues across the country. Polls close at 11pm Italian time.

Matteo Renzi, the center-left reformer who stepped aside in 2016 after the failure of a controversial constitutional referendum, is also a contender as leader of the center-left Democratic Party (PD). The final opinion poll had the party trailing at 22.8%.Analysts do not expect any party or alliance to earn an outright majority, meaning Italy could be plunged into months of further political deadlock that could have broader implications for Europe. Europe on alertJUST WATCHEDIn Italy's election, migration is a key issueReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHIn Italy's election, migration is a key issue 03:31The state of the economy and security remained key issues ahead of the ballot, but one issue dominated this election -- immigration.Right-wing parties pushed an anti-immigration agenda. The Northern League has advocated for mass expulsions and pledged to put \"Italians first.\" The narrative around immigration took a darker turn after a man linked with neo-fascist political parties apparently went on a shooting rampage targeting African migrants in the town of Macerata. The incident fueled serious political debate about how the country is reconciling its fascist past. The poll is being closely scrutinized by European leaders who are concerned by the increasingly euro-skeptical sentiment and fearful of any instability in the Eurozone's third-largest economy. \"This political uncertainty, government instability and the prospect of repeated elections configure to a 'perfect storm' which could harm one of the main European democracies and further destabilize an already weak continental alliance,\" Fabio Bordignon, a political scientist at the University of Urbino Carlo Bo, told CNN ahead of the vote.Related: Can anything save Italy from a return to fascism?How the vote worksA pedestrian passes in front of election posters in Milan on March 1, 2018.Adding to the chaos of Italian politics, a new (and untested) hybrid electoral method -- which encourages coalitions -- is in play this time round.The new system combines a first-past-the-post (FPTP) approach with proportional representation (PR). FPTP means the candidate who gets the most votes in a constituency wins a seat in Parliament; PR means that additional seats will be allotted to parties based on the proportion of votes they win nationwide.Of the 630 seats in lower house of Parliament -- the Chamber of Deputies -- 232 will be elected through FPTP, and 386 through PR. The remaining 12 seats are determined by overseas constituencies. A similar split will be used for Italy's upper house -- the Senate -- with 102 members elected by FPTP and 207 through PR.Related: Rome's sad decline sums up Italy's problemsWith an unproven new system in place and a bloc of undecided voters, many observers believe Italy is headed toward a hung Parliament.\"The most likely outcome is that no coherent parliamentary majority will exist after March 4,\" Paolo Chiocchetti, fellow of the Robert Schuman Institute of European Affairs at the University of Luxembourg. \"In this case, it is likely that the (Paolo) Gentiloni government will continue to sit in a provisional capacity while parties enter long discussions on whether (to build) an 'all-party' technical government limited to a set of specific reforms or call new general elections,\" he said.This story has been corrected to reflect the Democratic Party's standing in the final poll of polls published by YouTrend on February 16, 2018.",

        "content": "Tegelsbarg, Germany (CNN)German Chancellor Angela Merkel is hoping for another term after more than a decade in power, but she'll have to get past one major obstacle: a sneaker-wearing 28-year-old named Kevin Kuehnert.Kuehnert is the millennial behind the NoGroKo campaign, short for No Grand Coalition, which has turned Germany's normally staid politics upside down. Thanks to Kuehnert, Merkel's proposed coalition government between her conservative party and the Social Democrats (SPD) now hangs on a yes or no vote by the SPD's rank and file.  More than 400,000 are casting ballots in a postal vote and the results will be announced on Sunday.\"We cannot continue like this: the cozy politics represented by Angela Merkel which does not decide anything,\" he told CNN.\"This is now, slowly, ending. This debate in now breaking through in my own party and I believe in society.\"Potential blow to MerkelRead MoreA \"Yes\" vote would mean Merkel can breathe a sigh of relief and get back to running the country with the coalition government safely in place. A \"No\" vote would mean Merkel must scrap the coalition and either take her chances with a minority government or face new elections.Kuehnert has done all this in his spare time for no pay within three short months of being elected as the SPD youth leader.\"No, I don't have a chauffeur who drives me around,\" Kuehnert said, comparing himself to other full-time politicians, \"but I basically do the same as any other politician in Germany -- only that I do it in my free time.\" How Angela Merkel is preparing Germany for her grand exitGermany's September 2017 election was supposed to be an easy victory for Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), and she was expected to cruise to her fourth term in office as Chancellor. Instead, voters revolted against the status quo. Both CDU and the SPD barely maintained their status as Germany's top parties, suffering record losses and losing millions of votes to the far-right nationalist party, Alternative for Germany (AfD), which took nearly 13% of the vote.  Returning to its rootsThat's when Kuehnert swung into action.  He believes the SPD needs to reestablish its socialist roots as an opposition party rather than be a part of Merkel's government. To join the coalition would cede the leading opposition role to the AfD. \"The differences between the big political parties have systematically become blurred,\" Kuehnert told CNN. \"That will only end up strengthening political parties like the right-wing populists. Not without reason they have integrated the word 'Alternative' into their name because you get the impression that there are no longer alternatives amongst the traditional German parties.\" \"I think a new grand coalition is playing right into that and this is more dangerous for democracy than possible new elections.\"Merkel makes breakthrough with preliminary coalition dealThat attitude caught Germany's political elders by surprise. As Merkel tried to hammer out a coalition agreement with the SPD, a senior member of the CDU's sister party, the Christian Socialists (CSU), dismissed Kuehnert's NoGroKo campaign as a \"dwarf uprising,\" a swipe at Kuehnert's youthful inexperience and his height. Kuehnert is 5 feet 6 inches tall. Kuehnert may be short in stature, but he's long on ambition. In a rousing speech to the SPD's party congress in January he responded: \"It's better for us to be dwarves for now so that we may become giants in the future.\"Impassioned appealCNN met Kuehnert on a snowy day in Tegelsbarg, a sleepy suburb of Hamburg and a traditional stronghold of SPD supporters. The last stop on his NoGroKo campaign was open to the public and held in a community center brightly decorated with children's paintings. The mostly elderly audience of 30 or so people had coffee and cakes and listened respectfully to Kuehnert's impassioned appeal for a new brand of socialism in Germany. Many had come simply to see Kuehnert for themselves. The crowd laughed as one woman shouted out to demand his age. SPD youth member Hesam Jozvebayat, who came to see Kuehnert speak, told CNN he is voting to reject a coalition government.\"I was skeptical but I am impressed with you, Kevin,\" said Peter Wetzel, an SPD member for 52 years. \"But I have a question: We have been already without a government for four months. I worry: What happens if we really say no? Will this mean new elections? What does it mean for our country and Europe?''But others in the audience were willing to risk new elections. Hesam Jozvebayat, a student member of the SPD, voted to reject the coalition government.''A grand coalition does not allow for debates that are so important to us here in Germany. Instead, it hushes up the move to the right,\" Jozvebayat told CNN. \"If a grand coalition comes together nothing will be discussed out in public anymore. Everything is set in stone and nothing will be challenged. This will only lead to the far-right forces entrenching even more.'' Kuehnert is hoping the party will reject the coalition on Sunday, but said that a \"yes\" vote would not deter him from forcing change within the party. SPD youth leader Kevin Kuehnert argues that the party needs to stay in opposition to return to its socialist roots.\"The most important thing for us is a process of rejuvenation,\" he said. \"Over the next few years this party needs to justify why people need us in the 21st century.\" Kuehnert's critics may dismiss him as a millennial upstart. But since January, the SPD has signed up 25,000 new members and Kuehnert has plenty of energy, taking inspiration from the likes of US Senator Bernie Sanders and UK opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn. \"They managed to inspire young people with traditional political answers,\" he said. \"Those who were arguing that socialist democracy no longer has a future -- that their ideas belong to yesterday and would no longer excite anyone -- well, they showed us differently. They were able to light a fire for this political idea.\"When asked, however, if he has designs on the Chancellery one day, he laughed. \"Oh no! Not to become Chancellor. I wouldn't have any free time to myself. And I like my free time.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Catalonia's former separatist leader, Carles Puigdemont, has withdrawn his candidacy for president of the Spanish region after months of political deadlock with Madrid. Puigdemont was the only candidate put forward by Catalonia's parliament in Barcelona and lawmakers were expected to vote him in for another term as president.But Puigdemont has been unable to overcome Madrid, which continues to seek the arrest of the separatist over his aggressive push to break Catalonia away from Spain. The independence drive plunged the country into its worst political crisis in decades.Catalan President Carles Puigdemont (center on balcony) addresses Catalan mayors after parliament declared unilateral independence, on October 27, 2017. In a video posted to his Twitter account on Thursday, Puigdemont said he informed the President of the Parliament of Catalonia \"to start as quickly as possible the round of contacts with the different parliamentary groups to proceed with the election of a new candidate to be invested as president of the regional government.\" Puigdemont said his decision \"does not fully guarantee the restoration of our autonomy ... But it will give us the freedom to undertake the next phase of the road towards independence\" from Spain.Read MorePuigdemont said his party would propose a pro-secession campaigner, Jordi Sanchez -- currently in remand in a Madrid prison on charges of sedition -- as an alternative candidate, Reuters reported. The nomination of Sanchez is likely to be just as fraught with difficulty, given that he is in detention, according to Reuters.Self-imposed exilePuigdemont has lived in self-imposed exile in Belgium since October last year and has fought a war of words with Madrid from afar. But Madrid, which has maintained it has the law on its side, has waited out the crisis, refusing to allow Puigdemont to rule from abroad.If Puigdemont returns to Spain, he will no doubt be arrested, making his return to the presidency problematic. Spanish authorities accuse Puigdemont of rebellion, sedition and misuse of funds over his role in an illegal referendum to secede from Spain and parliament's declaration of unilateral independence in October last year. Other members of his political entourage have been jailed in Madrid, awaiting trial over their roles in the independence push.People wave the pro-independence Catalan flag at a rally on September 11, 2016, in Barcelona.Madrid imposed direct rule on Catalonia after the independence declaration, stripping the autonomous region of many of its administrative powers. It has shown no sign that it plans to withdraw from Catalonia, though it is likely to if a candidate it regards as legitimate is anointed president.Madrid called a snap election for December last year in hope of having a more moderate Catalan government to deal with, but its plan backfired when the region voted a majority of pro-independence MPs into parliament, maintaining the status quo. The region has been without an official leader since Puigdemont fled to Belgium in October last year.His future appeared in doubt around a month ago, when one of his advisers was caught on camera receiving text messages from the downtrodden politician who seemed to have lost the support of Catalonia's pro-independence alliance.\"It's over,\" Puigdemont was alleged to have written.

Blizzards brought traffic to a halt on one of Scotland's major motorways overnight.Why is this extreme weather happening?Much of Europe has been blanketed in snow this week, with rare falls of the icy stuff in the south of France, Spain and Italy.According to Simon Clark, researcher of stratosphere-troposphere interactions in Bristol, England, the current cold snap was triggered by a disruption to the stratospheric polar vortex -- a doughnut of air 6,000km (3,800 miles) across that forms high up in the atmosphere above the Arctic Circle every winter.Now and again -- perhaps six times every decade -- the vortex gets split in two, a phenomenon known as sudden stratospheric warming. Venice has seen an unusual amount of snow this week.The disruption allows icy Arctic air to spread further south, often lowering temperatures across much of the northern hemisphere.\"That big mass of Arctic air -- which is normally trapped over the poles, so it's really freezing cold -- is then able to spill further south,\" Clark told CNN.Arctic temperatures surge in the dead of winter Storm Emma, currently making its way across the UK from the southwest, is a normal phenomenon for this time of year, and would usually result in heavy rainfall.But as it meets the freezing polar air swirling around much of Britain, the storm is much more likely to dump its moisture as snow, Clark explained.While mainland Europe \"will still be affected by Emma... we (in the UK) are probably going to take the brunt of the moisture,\" said Clark.Conditions are expected to improve by the end of the weekend, but average temperatures across the UK could remain lower than normal over the next month as the polar air gradually returns to the Arctic.Clark expects Europe to feel the effects of disruptions to the vortex more often as the global climate continues to warm.\"It's very difficult to say for sure whether this one event was caused by climate change,\" he said, \"but as the climate warms, we expect the polar vortex to get weaker.... We will then see more of these sudden warmings.\"Precise predictions are difficult, however, due to the rate at which the climate is changing. \"It's changing faster than we can collect data on it,\" Clark said.",

Obvious to everyone except the referee and his officials, who somehow missed the \"Hand of God.\"But what's this? Tunisian referee Ali Bin Nasser has his hand to his ear, listening to information being relayed to him by the Video Assistant Referee who is in a facility just outside the Estadio Azteca.Then Nasser consults the pitch-side TV screens to review the incident and returns to the pitch to show Maradona a yellow card for deliberate handball.Without the \"Hand of God,\" would Maradona have gone on to score the \"Goal of the Century\" just four minutes later when he weaved his way past a posse of English defenders before beating Shilton with a slick finish?And would Argentina have beaten England and gone on to win the World Cup?

consecutive season without Champions League football, it's no wonder fans are pining for the good old days like never before.Arsenal's ever-vocal following like to remind their fellow Premier League fans of a certain 49-game unbeaten run.Dubbed the \"Invincibles,\" Arsenal's run of games without defeat stretched over three seasons, before eventually being ended by Manchester United in controversial fashion.But had Mike Riley, the referee for that ill-tempered fixture, had VAR to assist him, how might things have been different?Instead of awarding Manchester United a penalty for Sol Campbell's foul on Wayne Rooney, Riley shows the England forward a yellow card for diving.If Ruud van Nistelrooy hadn't scored that penalty, redemption for his miss in the \"Battle of Old Trafford\" a season earlier, to set up the 2-0 win, how much longer would Arsenal's unbeaten run have gone on?Could Arsene Wenger's men have potentially made it two consecutive seasons without tasting defeat, or

controversially sent off Italy's Francesco Totti for diving, before disallowing a legitimate goal from Damiano Tommasi, who was quite clearly more than a yard onside.With the Golden Goal rule in place, Tommasi's strike should have sent Italy through to play Spain in the quarterfinals, instead it was Ahn Jung-Hwan who scored the decisive goal.More controversy followed in South Korea's match

English journalist as having \"descended into farce,\" could have be oh-so different with the help of VAR.As manager of South Korea, this was the tournament that ensured Dutch coach Guus Hiddink's was

quite literally -- and controlled the ball with his palm, before squaring across goal for William Gallas.The defender nodded the ball into the empty net and wheeled away in celebration, soon being joined by the rest of his teammates.For Ireland, even harder to stomach than the disappointment of losing was the image of Henry, who knowing, and later admitting he had cheated, went around to console the Irish players individually.With VAR's intervention, however, Swedish referee Martin Hansson and his officials it's likely \"La Main de Dieu\" wouldn't have been awarded.Had France failed

        "content": "Moscow (CNN)Russian President Vladimir Putin has raised hackles in Washington with his claim -- unveiled Thursday -- that Russia is fielding a formidable new arsenal that can thwart US ballistic missile defenses.So what new strategic weaponry does Russia have, and how does this it enhance its military power? And does this mean a new Cold War is in the offing?Here are the basics about the new weaponry revealed by Putin as he gave his annual address to the Russian Parliament.A new generation of intercontinental ballistic missile: The Sarmat would be a more capable rocket designed to replace the Voevoda ICBM, known by the NATO designation SS-18 Satan. It could loft its payload over a longer distance -- capable of crossing the South Pole as well as the North Pole, the shortest route between Russia and the United States. Is it deployed? No. Putin said the Russian military has begun the \"active phase\" for testing the new missile. Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti Friday cited a Russian lawmaker saying pre-production versions of the rocket would enter the inventory soon.Read MoreA nuclear-powered cruise missile: Putin boasted that the Russians had developed a low-flying cruise missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead that could stay aloft indefinitely: It would be powered by a nuclear power plant. Is it fully operational? No. At the end of 2017, Putin said, Russia conducted a successful launch of the missile.JUST WATCHEDPutin announces 'invincible' new missileReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPutin announces 'invincible' new missile 00:55A unmanned underwater vehicle: Putin said the Russian military had been developing a stealthy underwater vehicle that can target a wide range of targets, including carrier groups or coastal bases. Deployed? Not yet. The 2018 US Nuclear Posture Review notes that Russia is developing a \"new intercontinental, nuclear armed, nuclear-powered, undersea autonomous torpedo\" as a new nuclear-weapons delivery system. Putin said trials began in December.A new air-launched missile: Putin said Russia has developed an air-launched missile capable of flying at several times the speed of sound, capable of overcoming air-defense systems. \"Russia has such weapons already,\" he said. Fully operational? Apparently. Putin said the system -- called Kinzhal, or Dagger -- had successfully completed testing and had been deployed operationally beginning on December 1 at the airfields of Russia's Southern Military District.Journalists watch as Russian President Vladimir Putin gives his annual state of the nation address in Manezh in Moscow, Russia, Thursday, March 1, 2018.A hypersonic glide vehicle: Putin said Russia had developed a missile system with a weapon capable of flying \"like a meteorite\" at several times the speed of sound. Is it deployed? Unclear. The Nuclear Posture Review says Russia \"is developing\" a hypersonic glide vehicle. Russian state news agency Tass cited Russia's Strategic Missile Force Commander as saying that testing of the system \"has been successfully completed.\"So does this mean a new Cold War-style arms race is underway? According to Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman, no.\"The President noted that this in no way can be considered as the start of an arms race, because it's nothing but a Russian response to the breaking of the ABM treaty,\" Peskov told reporters Friday, referring to the decision by former US President George W. Bush to withdraw from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and deploy missile defenses.Russia's 'invincible' missile is chilling for everyoneThat grievance is nothing new. But observers are still worried.In comments Thursday on Twitter, Dmitri Trenin, the director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, said: \"Giving half the time in the annual address to the Russian parliament to a graphic description of new weapons' capabilities is a measure of how close the US and Russia have moved toward military collision.\"He added: \"For the foreseeable future, it looks that the US-Russia agenda will be limited to just one item: war prevention. Good luck to us all.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)More than 20 parties are in the running in Italy's general election on Sunday, but one shines out as likely to garner the most votes. According to the last opinion poll, the populist Five Star Movement (M5S) is currently the choice of 28.1% of the electorate, its stellar rise causing panic among Italy's older parties and politicians. In a speech Sunday, billionaire media mogul and center-right leader Silvio Berlusconi called M5S \"a dangerous sect.\"  Former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of the left-wing Democratic Party, in an interview with RTL radio, described the movement as a \"Noah's ark of money launderers, fraudsters and scroungers.\"But who are the people behind M5S, and more importantly, what do they stand for?The movement was founded in 2009 when the bearded and often foul-mouthed comedian Beppe Grillo, 69, teamed up with the late Italian internet guru Gianroberto Casaleggio. The two men ran an anti-establishment, anti-corruption blog and began to reach out to voters through Meetup groups on the internet. Read MorePreviously Grillo had been a prominent agitator in Italy, organizing \"V-Day\" protests, V standing for an Italian swear word. Comedian Beppe Grillo founded the Five Star Movement.The movement quickly gained popularity among an electorate fed up with Italy's economic decline and its mainstream politicians. \"For many, M5S represents a novelty, and above all a rejection of the establishment,\" said Marco Tarchi, professor of political science at the University of Florence.\"There is no historical equivalent. Some of its political positions can be considered populist, but its total transcendence of the left/right divide makes it different to other populist movement considered to be on the right, like Italy's Northern League or those on the left, like Spain's Podemos.\"The movement's name signifies the five things the party says it cares about most -- protection of the environment, public transport, free access to water for everyone, sustainable development and the right to internet access. It is also anti-globalization, anti-free trade, euroskeptic and against the vaccination of children, which it believes causes autism. M5S has been blamed for a rise in measles cases in Italy.  Why Italy's unpredictable election is testing nerves in Europe Grillo himself has also been accused of racism, even though he is married to an Iranian Muslim. In the 2013 elections, M5S secured a very comfortable quarter of the votes. It also fared well in the 2014 European elections, sending 17 deputies to the European Parliament, where M5S joined the political grouping that contains the United Kingdom Independence Party and German's far-right Alternative for Germany party. M5S's rise continued in 2016, when the movement won local elections in Rome, Turin, Livorno and other towns, with lawyer Virginia Raggi elected as the capital's first female mayor. However, Raggi has suffered from the resignation of several of her cabinet members and allegations of corruption involving her administration. Another M5S mayor in Sicily is under investigation. Rome's mayor, Virginia Raggi, is one of the party's success stories, though she has been the subject of controversy. In January M5S dropped its long-held threat to ditch the euro, a move that would be unpopular even though many Italians blame the single currency for a surge in the cost of living since its introduction in 2002.Grillo himself can't hold office because of a 1985 conviction for manslaughter arising from a car accident in which three friends died.In September 2017 Luigi Di Maio, 31, was elected as M5S's candidate for prime minister and political head of the party, with more than 82% of the supporters' votes.The son of a neo-fascist local politician from Avellino near Naples, the clean-cut and smartly dressed Di Maio is currently the deputy speaker of the Italian lower house. Berlusconi: Facing a new crisis, Italians turn to an old warhorseHis spectacular political ascendancy comes despite the fact he didn't complete his university law degree. He was a webmaster before entering politics.Di Maio is also seeking to counter the image of the party's cadres as naive social-media enthusiasts, rolling out names of a future governing team of \"super competents.\" So far his strategy hasn't gone too well. According to the New York Times, Di Maio touted one of his dream team, Alessia D'Alessandro, as a brilliant \"economist\" who had worked with German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrat party, when she did not, and was not even an economist.As the election campaign draws to a close, Di Maio has indicated he could be ready to make a parliamentary pact with other parties including the center-left Democratic Party, which according to the final opinion poll will be the second-largest party -- despite M5S's previous pledges not to enter a coalition with other parties. DP leader Matteo Renzi has currently ruled out such an alliance.But in a country where there are more flip-flops in politics than on the beach, anything is still possible.",

        "content": "Moscow (CNN)A massive cross-border drug bust has become a major public relations nightmare for Russia's diplomatic service, turning a positive story of international police cooperation into a snowballing media scandal at home. Last week, Argentine police announced the drug bust: The country's Gendarmer\u00eda Nacional said police had discovered and seized 389 kilograms of cocaine -- more than 850 pounds -- on the grounds of the Russian Embassy in Buenos Aires in December 2016. A police officer opens up a package of the seized cocaine on December 14, 2016.A sting operation followed, with Argentine and Russian investigators replacing the drugs with flour and then fitting the bags with GPS tracking devices to monitor the shipment, and identify and apprehend the smugglers.It seemed to have been a textbook example of cross-border cooperation, with Russian diplomats tipping off the Argentinians about the drugs, and the two countries working together to stop illicit drug traffic. Now it's a story the Russian government appears to want to wish away.In recent days, Russian media have begun raising uncomfortable questions for the Russian Foreign Ministry, questioning official explanations.Read MoreThe basic facts are not in doubt: Investigators said a former employee of the Russian Embassy in Argentina was among those arrested at his home in Russia. Maria Zakharova, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, confirmed that a member of the \"technical staff\" of the embassy who had worked on a short-term contract had been involved, and that the drugs had been discovered on the premises of a school on the embassy grounds.A police officer guards the suitcases found carrying the drugs.First, there were questions about how, exactly, the massive drug shipment could end up in a closely guarded diplomatic compound. Maxim Mironov, a professor and blogger whose children study in the school, said he believed the explanation was a \"a lie.\"The school grounds, Mironov said, are \"constantly guarded by FSB officers\" -- members of the Federal Security Service, one of Russia's intelligence agencies. \"Parents' entrance to the school grounds is strictly prohibited,\" he wrote in a blog post. \"If I need to talk to a teacher, they call her, she goes down and we talk at the entrance. If you need to meet with the principal's office, then they escort me to the principal's office.\"Then there were questions about how the shipment got to Russia. The Argentinian police released photos and videos of the sting operation that included shots of the plane that transported the cargo back to Russia: an Ilyushin-96 with the tail number RA-96023. That aircraft is part of the Special Flight Detachment Rossiya, a fleet of Russian government planes that ferries VIPs around the globe. That prompted intense speculation in the Russian media about how, exactly, a plane that belongs to the rough equivalent of the US presidential aircraft fleet was used for staging a drug delivery.Argentine police released photos of the Russian plane involved.The respected Russian business newspaper RBC, for instance, ran a major story about the role of the government transport aircraft in the cocaine trafficking case, drawing in part upon a Russian plane-spotting website, russianplanes.net. The Russian Foreign Ministry denied the plane was involved, and the plane-spotting website was taken offline, but the story of the drug bust nonetheless began to turn into a media frenzy, with Russian news outlets publishing dozens of stories on the strange circumstances of the case and tracing the whereabouts of the plane. According to the website Flightradar24.com, the plane landed Monday in Bangkok, possibly carrying Russian National Security Council head Nikolai Patrushev, observers speculated.Russia's diplomatic service, which routinely lambasts foreign media for spreading anti-Russian propaganda, responded swiftly and vociferously to domestic coverage of the scandal.On Tuesday, the Foreign Ministry said Russian media outlets covering the story had engaged in a \"campaign replete with unverified and conspiracy information.\" And they posted screenshots of those stories, emblazoned with a  red stamp reading \"FAKE\" -- an honor usually reserved for foreign news agencies that incur the displeasure of the ministry.Zakharova, an official with a knack for soundbites and a combative social media style, turned her verbal firepower on those questioning the veracity of the official Russian account. Responding to suggestions the case \"cast a shadow\" on Russia's diplomatic corps, she said: \"It's exactly the opposite. The success of this operation was ensured by the effective actions of the Russian ambassador and diplomatic personnel.\"And the Foreign Ministry also released a statement questioning the patriotism of Mironov, the man whose children attend the diplomatic school. The Russian Embassy in Buenos Aires released a scathing denunciation of him, saying \"Mr. Mironov's performance once again demonstrates his desire to make a name for himself by spitting on our country and its foreign policy service.\"An image release by the Argentine police of the drug haul.The statement went on to insinuate that his children might be expelled from the school. \"His children, we hope, will continue to study in the school at the embassy. Perhaps it will compensate them for the flaws of the anti-Russian atmosphere that reigns in their family.\"The Kremlin's take on the mystery plane? Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov swatted away questions Wednesday in a conference call with reporters.  Asked if Patrushev was on the plane, he said: \"I do not have this information. I think it is necessary to refer these questions to the air company.\"And asked if he was keeping an eye on the burgeoning scandal, Peskov said: \"This is not our prerogative. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (should comment on that) and, as far as I know, they provided all the necessary information.\"",

They originated in the Arabian Peninsula and are believed to be 4,500 years old, one of the oldest breeds in the world. In contrast the Thoroughbred was developed in the early 18th century. English mares were bred with Arabian and other stallions to create horses with great stamina and speed. It is said that 95% of male thoroughbreds can be traced back to just one stallion, the Darley Arabian, born in 1700.\"Our passion for horses is something we've inherited and for us to own a horse or to be a horse owner is a privilege,\" explains al Kaabi, \"so we would like to keep this tradition for generations to come.\"Focus on EuropeMuch like its investment in football clubs Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain, the majority of Qatar's horse racing projects are in Europe. QIPCO, a private investment company in Qatar, became the official sponsor of the $25 million British Champions Series in 2011.The climax of the series is the British Champions Day at Ascot, which is the UK's richest race day with a prize pot of $6.2m.In December 2014, Qatar signed up to partner with Glorious Goodwood, which was subsequently renamed as the Qatar Goodwood Festival. The 10-year deal, described as the biggest in the history of British racing, was reportedly worth $2.8m per year. Qatar's other horse racing tie-ins include a lucrative sponsorship of Europe's richest event, the $6m Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe that takes place in Paris every October.READ: Female jockeys just as good as the men, study revealsMajor playersQatar sees horse racing as a vehicle to increase the country's international profile.\"Qatar is a big investor around the world, in sport, economics and different kinds of fields, including horse racing,\" continued al Kaabi. \"We play a major part in racing around the world through our investment in horses and sponsorships. \"The hope is that Qatar can compete around the world and to feel part of the horse racing industry.\"Qatar's involvement in racing's traditional European heartlands is growing. It's hoped this will have a knock-on effect on the sport domestically.

Unlike many other race meetings, it feels like people are there to see the horses.\"We've had a lot of runners from overseas at this year's Emir's Sword Festival showing that international interest in Qatar racing is high,\" explained Nasser. \"There was lots of positive feedback from top trainers which was very pleasing to hear.\" Local runner, The Blue Eye, won his second Emir's Trophy in three years.

We literally sat down every weekend, got pens and paper out, and sketched out where we wanted to go, why we wanted to do it and why it was so important to us.\"READ: 'Planet doomed unless ocean health improves' -- around-the-world yachtswomanJUST WATCHEDMainsail: The Volvo Ocean Race in AustraliaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMainsail: The Volvo Ocean Race in Australia 22:32'Dangerous environment' Although Craven had competed in the 2000 BT Global Challenge around-the-world race for amateur sailors -- at the time known as the \"world's toughest yacht race\" -- his attorney wife, Nichola, had only been sailing twice, both times getting sea sick.

How a young family changed their lives and sailed around the world\" by Caspar Craven)\"We didn't have a boat either, and when we told everybody, they laughed and thought it was completely ridiculous,\" Craven said.Craven started his first business catching crabs and lobsters when he was 14 before going to university and training as a chartered accountant. He used some of his business experience to plan the trip. \"We created a vision statement, which we put on the wall in our kitchen,\" said Craven, a former investment banker at KPMG, turned e-commerce entrepreneur in 2001 -- building, growing and selling companies mainly in the technology sector. \"It basically said, 'On August 1, 2014, we are going to set sail.' So we gave ourselves five years to transform our finances, our relationship, how we worked together as a family, to get a boat and to get all the training and preparation in place. The sea can be a dangerous environment, that's why we did so much preparation.\"  JUST WATCHEDAmerica's Cup: How Team NZ won in BermudaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAmerica's Cup: How Team NZ won in Bermuda 22:31'Life experiences' Their main motivation? \"Creating magical life experiences for our children, let them explore and see the world,\" Craven said. Over the next five years, Craven said he created three separate $1 million businesses --  one of which, a data analytics company, he sold for a seven-figure sum while he was sailing across the Pacific Ocean. There were some hurdles to overcome: Craven had back surgery five weeks before departure, while the family also welcomed their third child, Willow, in 2012.\"We were outnumbered,\" laughed Craven.In August 2014, Caspar, Nichola, Bluebell, Columbus and Willow Craven set sail in their 53-foot boat  Aretha from Southampton on England's south coast. They made their way to La Palma in the Canary Islands and joined the Atlantic Rally for Cruisers (ARC), where some 200 yachts crossed the Atlantic in convoy to St. Lucia in the Caribbean. After passing through the Panama Canal they joined the World ARC in Panama so they could sail in company across the Pacific to Australia.But after leaving Tahiti en route for Australia, disaster struck.

Rather than turning to blame and getting angry, focus on how you work together and how you solve the problem in hand.\"Having tried and failed to restore power, the family resorted to plan B -- sail with no electrical power and try to reach the nearest land, which was the tiny island country of Niue, west of the Cook Islands.For the next three days, Caspar and Nichola hand-steered the yacht through heavy seas and driving rain, navigating by the sun, the moon and the stars, until they reached Niue.\"We just found humor in the situation and we worked together as a team,\" Craven said. \"It became one of our proudest moments working together.\" From Australia they sailed to Indonesia, before undertaking a second Atlantic crossing to Brazil.

Having learned everything there was to know about fish, he set up a business making and selling fishing lures and writing fishing advice sheets, which he would take round the other boats when they were docked. \"What we discovered just letting the kids follow their passion and interests, it took them to every subject,\" Craven said. \"To maths, to science, to literacy, to business, to communications.

        "content": "(CNN)British Prime Minister Theresa May has moved swiftly to shore up her government in the wake of the sudden resignation of a senior minister over an immigration scandal late on Sunday night.May appointed Sajid Javid, a second-generation migrant whose parents came to Britain from Pakistan, as Home Secretary on Monday morning, plugging a hole left when predecessor Amber Rudd fell victim to a growing controversy over the treatment of the so-called Windrush generation of immigrants.Javid, 48, is the first member of an ethnic minority to hold the position, one of the most senior in the British government. He had spoken out forcefully on the plight of people from former British colonies who arrived legally in Britain in the 1950s and 60s, but who had struggled to prove their status amid a wider crackdown on illegal immigration. They became known as the Windrush generation after the name of the ship that brought an early group of Caribbean migrants to Britain in 1948.It is a significant promotion for Javid, who was previously the Secretary of State for Communities, Local Government and Housing. He voted Remain in the 2016 referendum on British membership of the European Union, and his appointment --  announced by Prime Minister Theresa May in a tweet Monday morning -- maintains the delicate and often uneasy balance between \"remainers\" and \"Brexiters\" in the government.Sajid Javid MP @SajidJavid becomes Secretary of State for the @UKHomeOffice\u2014 UK Prime Minister (@10DowningStreet) April 30, 2018\n\nFormer Home Secretary Rudd quit the top Cabinet post after admitting she \"inadvertently misled\" government over targets for the deportation of illegal immigrants.Read MoreRudd had claimed to a parliamentary committee that her department did not impose targets, but the Guardian reported on Sunday that in a private letter to May in 2017, she had informed the Prime Minister that she intended to boost deportations by 10%.Her position on deportations came against the backdrop of her departments' handling of the \"Windrush generation,\" men and women from the Caribbean who arrived legally in Britain in the 1950s and 60s, but who have struggled to prove their status amid the crackdown on illegal immigration.Rudd was the fourth high-ranking minister to resign from Prime Minister May's Conservative government in the past six months.Britain's new Home Secretary Sajid Javid.Former Home Secretary Amber Rudd and key ally Prime Minister Theresa May.Shortly after the appointment, Javid told the BBC his \"most urgent task\" was making sure the Windrush generation was \"treated with the decency and the fairness that they deserve.\"He said his parents, who migrated from Pakistan to the UK, would be incredibly proud of his appointment, before adding: \"But I haven't called my mum yet.\"Javid previously voiced his concern over the Windrush scandal in an interview with British newspaper The Sunday Telegraph at the weekend, saying one of his first thoughts was, \"It could have been me.\"\"I'm a second-generation migrant. My parents came to this country from Pakistan, just like the Windrush generation,\" he said, adding that his father worked in a cotton mill and as a bus driver.\"When I heard about the Windrush issue I thought, 'That could be my mum ... it could be my dad ... it could be my uncle ... it could be me.'\"Javid's appointment comes at a delicate time for the embattled Prime Minister, struggling on multiple fronts  negotiating Britain's exit from the EU.Writing in the Telegraph in 2016, Javid said he was a \"Eurosceptic and proud of it.\" But at the same time, ultimately believed \"that Britain is better off in (the EU).\"Before entering politics, Javid was managing director at Deutsche Bank, and has previously said staying in the European single market -- the tariff-free common trading area -- was a big factor in his decision to vote remain. He was Business Secretary in the previous government of David Cameron.What is the Windrush scandal?The Windrush generation came to Britain to help in the postwar rebuilding efforts, following the devastating effects of World War II.They came to symbolize the seismic demographic changes that took place in post-war Britain, when hundreds of thousands of people came to the United Kingdom from former British colonies, known as the Commonwealth.JUST WATCHEDCaribbean immigrants in UK face deportationReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCaribbean immigrants in UK face deportation 02:27But in recent years, successive British governments have sought to appear tough on illegal immigration, and their descendants are now struggling to prove a citizenship status they previously took for granted.May's government recently said the Home Office destroyed landing documents for members of the Windrush generation and their children, compounding the difficulties they faced in proving their right to be in the UK. Some lost their jobs, others faced difficulty accessing welfare benefits and a few were threatened with deportation.May apologized to Caribbean leaders for any \"anxiety\" caused by the records destruction, which occurred when she was Home Secretary under the previous administration.May serve as Home Secretary from 2010 to 2016 under then-Prime Minister David Cameron. Policies from that time included sending out vans to tell illegal immigrants to \"go home,\" making regular deportations and resistance to rescue operations that pulled drowning migrants from the Mediterranean.Rudd's departure deals a further blow to the embattled Prime Minister's leadership, after a misjudged election last year aimed at \"strengthening her hand\" in Brexit negotiations backfired spectacularly when her Conservative party lost its parliamentary majority. And with Parliament set to debate a petition this week on an amnesty for \"anyone who was a minor that arrived In Britain between 1948 to 1971,\" which would include the Windrush generation, May looks sure to face more questions over her government's handling of the scandal.

        "content": "(CNN)Embattled British Prime Minister Theresa May lost a key ally late Sunday with the resignation of Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who quit after claiming she \"inadvertently misled\" government over targets for the deportation of illegal immigrants.Rudd resigned Sunday amid a growing scandal over the government's mistreatment of the so-called \"Windrush generation,\" men and women from the Caribbean who arrived in Britain in the 1950s and 60s, but in recent years have been declared illegal immigrants despite having lived in the country for decades.She becomes the fourth high-ranking minister to resign from May's government in the past six months. It puts further pressure on May, already struggling to maintain government unity over faltering Brexit talks.Rudd had been under pressure to step down over her involvement in the affair, following allegations that members of the Windrush generation -- so named after the ship that had brought hundreds of Caribbean migrants to Britain -- had recently been refused medical care, denied housing and threatened with deportation.On Monday, Rudd was due to face a fiery session in the House of Commons. Instead, May is expected to announce Rudd's replacement, an influential role that comes at a delicate time for the UK government as its negotiates Britain's exit from the European Union.Read MoreParliament will also debate a petition Monday calling for an amnesty for \"anyone who was a minor that arrived In Britain between 1948 to 1971,\" which would include the Windrush generation. Amber Rudd Rudd's downfallThe Home Affairs Select Committee questioned Rudd last week over government targets for the removal of illegal immigrants. Rudd told the committee she had no knowledge of targets. However, the Guardian on Sunday published a memo written by Rudd in which she said deportation quotas had been set.\"Since appearing before the Select Committee, I have reviewed the advice I was given on this issue and become aware of information provided to my office which makes mention of targets. I should have been aware of this, and I take full responsibility for the fact that I was not,\" Rudd said in her resignation letter. The Prime Minister accepted Rudd's resignation, writing: \"I was very sorry to receive it, but understand your reasons for doing so.\" May said that Rudd had answered questions from the House of Commons and the Home Affairs Select Committee in good faith, but that she understood her decision to step down in the light of Rudd's review of  the advice she'd been given.On Saturday, more than 200 Members of Parliament from across the political spectrum signed a letter addressed to May accusing Rudd of making up immigration policy \"on the hoof\" in a bid to overcome the scandal.Labour MP David Lammy, who wrote the letter, said the controversy was an \"international embarrassment\" for Britain. Speaking on Sky News on Sunday, he said the letter was a \"cross-party effort to ensure the Windrush generation get the guarantees they need, they know where they stand and we move on from this situation.\"Lammy said Rudd's resignation must not detract from the core issue of seeking justice for Windrush citizens. \"At its heart this crisis is about a system that was allowed to dehumanise and victimise Windrush British citizens... That policy must now be reviewed, and the Home Office must move quickly to compensate and grant citizenship to the Windush generation,\" he tweeted.The resignation of the Home Secretary must not detract from the fact that this crisis was a direct result of the hostile environment policy. That policy must now be reviewed, and the Home Office must move quickly to compensate and grant citizenship to the Windush generation. (3)\u2014 David Lammy (@DavidLammy) April 29, 2018\n\nWindrush scandal Theresa MayThe Windrush generation came to Britain to help in the postwar rebuilding efforts, following the devastating effects of World War II.May's government recently said the Home Office destroyed landing documents for members of the Windrush generation, meaning some of them and their children faced deportation after decades living in Britain because they don't have the correct paperwork.May apologized to Caribbean leaders for any \"anxiety\" caused by the records destruction, which occurred when she was home secretary under the previous administration.May was Rudd's predecessor, serving as Home Secretary from 2010 to 2016 under then-Prime Minister David Cameron. Policies from that time included sending out vans to tell illegal immigrants to \"go home,\" making regular deportations and resistance to rescue operations that pulled drowning migrants from the Mediterranean.Blame for the scandal was quickly directed toward May. Tom Watson, the deputy leader of the opposition Labour Party, tweeted: \"I see Amber Rudd is carrying the can for the person originally responsible for this scandal -- Theresa May.\"I see Amber Rudd is carrying the can for the person originally responsible for this scandal - Theresa May.\u2014 Tom Watson (@tom_watson) April 29, 2018\n\nDowning Street will have accepted Rudd's resignation reluctantly. With Rudd gone, the focus could now switch to the architect of the \"hostile environment\" policy: Theresa May\u2014 Jonathan Freedland (@Freedland) April 29, 2018\n\nThe Windrush generation came to symbolize the seismic demographic changes that took place in post-war Britain, when hundreds of thousands of people came to the United Kingdom from former British colonies, known as the Commonwealth.But in recent years, successive British governments have sought to appear tough on illegal immigration, and their descendants are now struggling to prove a citizenship status they previously took for granted.Rudd last week apologized for and told the House of Commons the UK would work to ensure citizenship for the Windrush generation.JUST WATCHEDCaribbean immigrants in UK face deportationReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCaribbean immigrants in UK face deportation 02:27Political strugglesRudd's resignation further imperils May's government.

She previously served in the government as secretary of state for energy and climate change, parliamentary under secretary of state for climate change and assistant government whip.

        "content": "London (CNN)Think of \"royalty\" and an image of a starched and somber monarch might come to mind. Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, for example. Despite some recent glimpses of her famed sense of humor -- including a mild joke aimed at Presidents Trump and Obama -- she remains a paragon of predictability and poise.But the country's young royals are doing things differently. And no one more so than Prince Harry, who is to wed Meghan Markle on May 19.It's not just his choice of bride that's royally unconventional. In a string of unprecedented interviews last year, Harry opened up about the burden of grief since his mother's death, revealed he'd seen a therapist after coming close to a breakdown and said he thinks no one in the royal family wants to be monarch.Chris Jackson, royal photographer for Getty Images, has been photographing the prince on official occasions for 14 years and says that, with Harry, \"you never really know what to expect.\"Prince Harry has a natural affinity with children, photographer Chris Jackson explains. \"He connects with them in a very unique way and gets stuck in with whatever they're doing.\" \"He is great fun to photograph, he's got a real passion and real energy,\" Jackson tells CNN. \"(But) you've got to learn to always be ready... You learn to expect the unexpected.\"Read MoreThrough Jackson's images and unique insights, CNN looks at the prince's tumultuous life to date and asks: who is Meghan Markle's future husband?Related: Complete coverage of the Royal Wedding'There's still a lot of grief'Prince Henry Charles Albert David Windsor was born in London on September 15, 1984, a younger brother to William and, at the time, third in line to the throne. In many ways, Harry's childhood followed a familiar royal pattern. He attended private schools in London and Eton before training to be a soldier.But Harry's young years were marked by tragedy. A year after his parents' very public and acrimonious divorce, Harry's mother, Princess Diana, was killed along with her boyfriend Dodi Fayed in a car accident in Paris.Related: Princess Diana's death changed how Britons saw the royalsHarry looks at flowers and messages left as tributes to Princess Diana at Kensington Palace on August 30, 2017, the 20th anniversary of her death.The first time he cried from grief was at the funeral, Harry revealed last year in an ITV documentary marking 20 years since Diana's death. And perhaps just once since then, he added. \"There's still a lot of grief that needs to be let out.\"In his youth, Harry earned the label of rebellious royal, facing accusations of underage drinking and cannabis use as a schoolboy, wearing a Nazi uniform to a costume party at 19 and partying nude in a Las Vegas hotel in 2012. \n\n\n\n\nIn a candid interview with the Telegraph's Bryony Gordon last April, Harry alluded to those years, admitting that shutting down his emotions after his mother's death had a \"serious effect\" on his personal and working life.\"It was 20 years of not thinking about it and two years of total chaos,\" he said, adding that therapy helped him.Jackson sees a prince who is now enjoying the process of shaping his identity as a royal. \"As his role has developed and changed to where he is today, he's embraced it,\" the photographer says. \"He's very comfortable in his current role.\"Related: Rebel, soldier and activist - Prince Harry is the epitome of a modern royal\"Prince Harry today... sees his unique position as an opportunity to change things for the good,\" says Jackson. And the Invictus Games is one of those opportunities. Here, Harry is seen congratulating the US team after they won the Wheelchair Basketball gold at the 2017 Games in Toronto.A military manThe prince's years in the military -- first as an army officer and later as an Apache helicopter pilot -- have had a big influence on that role. At the time, military life was another way of numbing himself to the pain of his mother's death, Harry explained last year.\"The 10 years that I was in the army, I just sort of dug my head in the sand,\" he told ITV. \"It was just white noise.\"Harry at the Calvary Old Comrades Association Annual Parade in London in 2007. The significance of his military career is etched on the prince's face at every commemorative event and military parade he attends.But his experiences as a soldier also seem to have offered him a path to somewhere more positive. Witnessing war and the life-shattering impact it can have on soldiers and their families inspired Harry to launch the Invictus Games -- an international multi-sport event for wounded, injured or sick members or veterans of the armed services -- in 2014.\"Invictus has been one of his biggest achievements,\" says Jackson, who has photographed Harry at each of the three Games held so far, the most recent in Toronto, Canada, last year. \"It certainly means a lot to everyone involved.\"And it means a lot to Harry too, Jackson explains. \"He feels very relaxed and at home in that environment,\" he says. \"The fact that he served as a helicopter pilot... commands a huge amount of respect from fellow soldiers. It gives him a sense of gravitas which he otherwise wouldn't have had.\"Related: Which countries still have a monarch?'He's breaking down barriers'The Invictus Games project wasn't Harry's first foray into charitable work. In 2006, he co-founded Sentebale, a charity that helps vulnerable children in the tiny southern African country of Lesotho. Following in his mother's footsteps, Harry campaigned to reduce the stigma around HIV and AIDS (famously taking a HIV test alongside pop star Rihanna during a trip to Barbados in 2016), while also co-running a mental health campaign with his brother and sister-in-law, and working to combat youth violence in the UK.\"It's been an organic process,\" says Jackson, referring to Harry's developing role since leaving the military. \"There was no set pathway. He's had to come up with a lot of these ideas and do a lot of it on his own.\"Related: Royal wedding 2018: What we know so farHarry first met an Australian woman named Daphne Dunne on a trip to Sydney in 2015.

It was such a sweet moment... She'd been waiting all day for him.\"Harry explained his motivation in the conversation with Bryony Gordon last year. \"The privilege comes with a huge amount of responsibility,\" he said. \"As long as we're this age and we're still interesting, we want to make as much of a difference as we can for the better.\"Jackson sees Harry as uniquely positioned to do that, given the \"real warmth, real affinity\" he brings with him to every public event. \"He's breaking down barriers,\" Jackson says.The photographer has taken countless pictures of the prince giving spontaneous hugs and kisses, and notes wryly that \"on more informal engagements, Harry keeps you on your toes.\"Children and adults alike respond to his natural approach, Jackson says . Some of his favorite pictures of the prince were taken in Lesotho as Harry spent time with the children being helped by Sentebale. \"It's somewhere he feels very relaxed,\" says Jackson. \"And kids certainly get excited about seeing him. He connects with them in a very unique way.\"Related: Why Harry and Meghan will be the best royal coupleIn one of Jackson's favorite pictures he has taken of the prince, Harry shows children in Lesotho a photo he has taken on his own camera.

Harry has been taking on more formal duties as the Queen steps back from public life, making official visits to countries including Singapore, Jamaica, Nepal, South Africa, New Zealand, Oman, Brazil and Estonia in the past few years alone.\"I always love going on a Prince Harry tour,\" says Jackson. \"He's a very powerful ambassador for the UK around the world.\"That work will continue when Harry is a married man -- he and Meghan plan to focus their energies on Commonwealth projects and the prince was recently made a Commonwealth Youth Ambassador.

Harry said the pair had had \"some pretty frank conversations\" about the life Meghan could be embarking on. \"It's a big deal,\" he said. \"It's not easy for anybody.\"As rumors of their relationship spread across the internet in late 2016, the couple was shocked by the hostility and harassment they faced. \"I tried to warn (Meghan) as much as possible, but I think both of us were totally surprised by the reaction,\" admitted Harry in November. But since taking the unprecedented step to berate the press and social media trolls for a \"wave of abuse,\" life has been smoother -- and Harry is convinced he and Meghan can tackle anything together.\"We're a fantastic team,\" said Harry. \"The fact that I fell in love with Meghan so incredibly quickly was confirmation to me that all the stars were aligned. Everything was just perfect.\"\"Hopefully we'll start a family in the near future,\" he added later.Related: What Meghan Markle tells us about the modern British monarchy\"(Harry) spent many years as a very successful solo royal,\" says Jackson. \"Now we're seeing him with Meghan and they make a great team.\"Jackson sees the couple's closeness on every outing. \"It's been great seeing the dynamic between them -- they work really well together,\" he says, adding: \"They clearly are very fond of each other.\"May 19 marks the start of a new chapter in Harry's life -- and it's an important day for Jackson too. He hopes to be positioned outside the chapel on their wedding day, ready to capture the newlyweds \"stepping out into the light for the first time as a married couple.\"No doubt Diana will be on the prince's mind that day. \"It is days like today when I really miss having her around and I miss being able to share the happy news,\" he said in the engagement interview. But he's sure his mother would have approved of his choice of wife: \"I think they'd be thick as thieves, without question...

Some protesters carried placards declaring, \"It is not abuse, it is rape.\" Others shouted, \"Yo te creo\" -- \"I believe you\" -- in reference to the victim of the assault.Read MoreProsecutors had sought 22 years for each defendant on the more serious charge, according to Spain's El Mundo newspaper.The case became known as \"la manada,\" or \"the wolf pack,\" after the name of a WhatsApp group on which the defendants and other friends chatted.Thousands protest Saturday in Pamplona over the sentence imposed on five men accused of the gang rape of a teenager.Both sides plan to appealThe men -- Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Prenda, Antonio Manuel Guerrero, \u00c1ngel Boza, Alfonso Jes\u00fas Cabezuelo and Jes\u00fas Escudero -- recorded cell phone video of their encounter in July 2016 with the woman, then 18, during Pamplona's famous San Ferm\u00edn festival.    According to court documents, WhatsApp messages circulated to the group by one of the defendants included \"us five are ing one girl,\" \"there is more than what I'm telling you,\" \"a *ing amazing trip\" and \"there is video.\"The court heard that the men, who denied wrongdoing, \"pushed\" the woman into a deserted hallway and told her to \"shut up\" before all engaging in sexual activity with her. She \"adopted a passive, submissive stance\" because she felt trapped and afraid, according to the sentencing document. One of the men took her phone from her bag before they left her there.   Masked women protest Saturday in Pamplona against sexual abuse.Under Spanish law, the lesser offense of sexual abuse differs from rape in that it does not involve violence or intimidation. On Friday, the official spokesman for Spain's government said it was reviewing whether the law on sexual crimes \"needs to be updated.\"\"The government has been, is and always will be with the victims,\" said the spokesman, Inigo Mendez de Vigo.Navarre's state prosecutor said the ruling by a three-judge panel would be appealed.

The case became known as \"la manada,\" or \"the wolf pack,\" after the name of a WhatsApp group on which the defendants and other friends chatted.Women take part in a demonstration Thursday in M\u00e1laga, Spain, against the sexual abuse of women.The men -- Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Prenda, Antonio Manuel Guerrero, \u00c1ngel Boza, Alfonso Jes\u00fas Cabezuelo and Jes\u00fas Escudero -- recorded cell phone video of their encounter in July 2016 with the girl, then 18, during Pamplona's famous San Ferm\u00edn festival.According to court documents, WhatsApp messages circulated to the group by one of the defendants included \"us five are ing one girl,\" \"there is more than what I'm telling you,\" \"a *ing amazing trip\" and \"there is video.\"The court heard that the men, who denied wrongdoing, \"pushed\" the girl into a deserted hallway and told her to \"shut up\" before all engaging in sexual activity with her. She \"adopted a passive, submissive stance\" because she felt trapped and afraid, according to the sentencing document. One of the men took her phone from her bag before they left her there.The case has shone a spotlight on Spanish law, under which the lesser offense of sexual abuse differs from rape in that it does not involve violence or intimidation. Navarre's state prosecutor said Thursday's ruling by a three-judge panel would be appealed. Defense attorney Agustin Martinez Becerra, who represents four of the accused, said Friday they would also appeal the sentence.The verdict has outraged many in Spain. Announcing that authorities would look again at the country's laws on sexual crimes, spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo insisted that \"the government has been, is and always will be with the victims.\" Defense Minister Maria Dolores de Cospedal earlier said she thought the sentence was \"too little\" and that legislation in this area \"might have to be looked at.\" \"As a person, as a citizen, as a woman, it's hard to come to terms with the content of the sentencing. What happened at the San Ferm\u00edn was barbaric and a situation no woman is comfortable in,\" she said.A woman holds a placard reading, \"Sister, I believe you,\" as large crowds demonstrate in M\u00e1laga.Susana D\u00edaz, Andalusia's regional president, tweeted: \"I always respect judicial sentences but this is one I neither understand nor agree with. We must have zero tolerance for sexual violence throughout society.\"Pedro S\u00e1nchez, leader of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, tweeted: \"She said NO. We believed you then and we still believe you. If what the 'wolf pack' did wasn't group violence against a defenseless woman, then what do we understand by rape?\"Iria Grandal, 27, was one of those who protested in Madrid. \"I was inspired to join the protest by the injustice of an absurd sentence,\" she told CNN. \"Five men pushing you inside the entrance of a house is enough intimidation to be considered rape and not sexual abuse.\"La Justicia hoy ha muerto. #YoSiTeCreo #NoEsNo #NoEsAbusoEsViolacion #LaManada pic.twitter.com/jAsJDmq4Bk\u2014 Iria Grandal (@IGrandal) April 26, 2018\n\nShe said the crowd gathered in front of the Ministry of Justice in Madrid and then marched to Spain's Congress, where there was a sit-in. Another sit-in was held in front of the Ministry of Equality. Everything finished around 11 p.m. Thursday when the crowd held a moment of silence, she said.In the videos that Grandal shared on social media, the crowd could be heard shouting, \"Yo te creo\" -- \"I believe you\" -- in reference to the victim of the assault.\"In Spain, there is still a lot of machismo and misogyny. In jobs, salaries, and including young people,\" Grandal said. \"But I think things are changing now. You could see it in the massive demonstration on March 8 -- for International Women's Day -- and you could see it now. Women will no longer remain silent, and the youngest among us are also taking to the streets to protest. \"We want to stop feeling afraid when going out, and we want to be treated for what we are: people.\"Jos\u00e9 Antonio Mart\u00edn Acosta, who belongs to the Gafas Moradas (Purple Glasses) feminist group fighting for gender equality, joined protests in the city of Bilbao.\"The 'manada' sentence made us hit the streets because the judges had sentenced it as an abuse, while it's nothing else but rape,\" he told CNN. The group demonstrated, he said, \"to fight the patriarchy and against an obsolete justice in which many people are still linked to the rules of (the) Franco regime.\"CNN's Katie Polglase and journalist Elena Gyldenkerne contributed to this report.",

The green island provides a stunning backdrop. Later, they'll be ashore, rum punch in hand, socializing with sailors from 30 countries.Follow @cnnsport\n\nIt's Antigua Sailing Week -- one of the sport's most famous regattas with a reputation for spectacular racing and serious partying.Read MoreJUST WATCHEDSurfing the wave called 'Jaws'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSurfing the wave called 'Jaws' 02:26READ: Irma -- a hurricane for the history booksIt began as a simple dash to Guadeloupe between friends in the 1950s, but this year's edition marks the 51st running of the prestigious week-long event.Antigua narrowly escaped the wrath of Hurricane Irma, which devastated neighboring Barbuda last October, but the knock-on effects have meant numbers are down \"by about 15-20 boats\" compared with the bumper 145-boat entry for last year's 50th anniversary.But organizers are still expecting to welcome about 120 boats and 1,000 sailors, who will bring about $4m of direct revenue to the island.Sailing Week is based out of English Harbour, with its historic 18th century Nelson's Dockyard and stunning Antigua Yacht Club, on the island's south coast.On the program is five days of coastal races of three to four hours, plus a longer race around Antigua race.   As the sun dips, the party starts. However, organizers are keen to insist the focus, once skewed too far towards the onshore activities, has been redressed.\"We've had our challenges, for sure,\" commercial director Alison Sly-Adams told CNN Sport. \"The event lost sight a little bit of what it was all about and that's easy to do when you're in such a great destination.\"But it's absolute DNA is about fantastic racing and I think we've got the balance right.\"READ: How windsurfer Robby Naish became a global iconBoats race off the start line during the 2017 Antigua Sailing Week.In the past the regatta featured races ending at different beaches around Antigua, but the advent of more stripped-out racing boats, with deeper keels and fewer sailors living aboard, made the logistics of running the regatta more difficult. Hence, it was brought back to English Harbour to restore its core values.\"What makes it so unique is we've got such a lovely backdrop and you get this great international atmosphere, but ultimately the reason people come is the racing,\" she adds.\"If you don't get that right and if you don't listen to the sailors and don't make sure they're getting what they need it's going to falter. That did happen for a while but I'm happy to say we've got the format right and the event seems to be building.\"'Amazing cross section'This year's fleet ranges from British businessman Sir Peter Harrison's 115ft ketch Sojana and superfast Volvo 70 Warrior to 20ft open keel boats.About 40 per cent of boats are chartered by visitors for the week, 30 per cent are sailed across the Atlantic from Europe or down from the US, and 30 per cent are owned by Caribbean sailors.The bulk of crews come from the UK, Germany, the US and the wider Caribbean region. \"We have an amazing cross section,\" says Sly-Adams. \"Yes, we have super rich yacht owners but there is a really good mix.\"READ: 'Weathered but wiser' -- around-the-world sailor learns harsh lessonsThe social side is a crucial ingredient in Antigua Sailing Week.'Breaking down barriers'In a further bid to democratize the event, Antigua established a national sailing academy in 2010 and introduced sailing into schools' national curriculum. In the early days, take up was slow, but it is now \"absolutely bearing fruit,\" says Sly-Adams, with demand outstripping places available.About 20 local youths will be sailing as part of the Youth to Keelboat Programme, with six pupils sailing a Cork 1720 against a crew of British youngsters from the state-run Greig City Academy in inner city London.\"The whole purpose was to break down the barriers,\" adds Sly-Adams. \"Yes, you've definitely still got that demographic of being a sport for white people, a sport for rich people but we're really seeing a lot of the youths getting into the sport and into the industry which is ultimately the goal -- to get them trained in sailing and confident so they're happy to go looking for jobs in the industry, of which there are many here.\"READ: Sailing's glamor tribe and the downsides of paradiseAntigua offers a stunning backdrop to the competitive racing.The Greig Academy, in which 75% of children are officially under-privileged, made waves last year when a team of pupils competed in the famous Fastnet Race onboard a 45-foot yacht which they raised the funds to buy. One of their number, 17-year-old Montel Fagan-Jordan, later earned the Yachting Journalists Association Young Sailor of the Year award, previously held by multiple Olympic medalist Ben Ainslie and Dame Ellen MacArthur. \"This project has snowballed from nothing,\" geography teacher Jon Holt told CNN Sport. \"It has become a massively aspirational thing where the youngest kids want to emulate Montel and all these others. Right now, we have this bizarre problem where we don't have the capacity to meet the demand.\"JUST WATCHEDThe life of windsurfing legend Robby NaishReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe life of windsurfing legend Robby Naish 22:45Sailing Week comes at the end of a season which began with Antigua Charter Yacht Show in December, a superyacht regatta in January, the Caribbean 600 race in February and a classic yacht event earlier in April. The income is \"vital to tourism and the economy of Antigua and Barbuda,\" according to Charles Fernandez, Minister of Tourism and Economic Development, while aiding ongoing fundraising efforts for Barbuda and other islands such as Dominica to the south. For the sailors, its salty reputation means it can be a \"week-long marathon\" for those pushing hard on and off the water.      But when the gun goes and sails are pulled in, thoughts of rum and reggae are buried until later.

In a statement, the party compared the new rules to government policies in apartheid South Africa. Follow @cnnsport\n\nThe regulations, which were announced by athletics' governing body the IAAF Thursday, will limit the testosterone levels of female athletes competing between 400m and a mile.They are aimed at athletes with Differences of Sex Development and are widely reported to impact South Africa's double Olympic champion Caster Semenya. \"The African National Congress (ANC) notes with great concern the International Association of Athletes Federation's (IAAF) new regulations on female testosterone,\" read a statement. Read More\"These new regulations infringe on the human rights of athletes, targeting mainly those in East Europe, Asia and the African continent. \"The racial undertones of this cannot go unnoticed. The regulations are a painful reminder of our past where an unjust government specifically legislated laws for certain activists in society to stifle their fight against an unjust system.\"Semenya won double gold at the Commonwealth Games in April.READ: Semenya may have to reduce hormone levelsFrom 1948 to 1991, South Africa's minority white ruling group imposed a system of racial segregation on the country. Under the system only white South Africans were allowed to vote. The ANC said it wanted the South African government to challenge the new regulation, which comes into effect in November, at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). \"We call on government to challenge this grossly unfair, unjust and blatant racist attempt by the IAAF to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and have these regulations set aside,\" it said.\"The ANC will stand with Caster Semenya in yet another attempt by international sport bodies to exlude and discriminate against her.\"The IAAF has yet to respond to CNN's request for comment.Are the IAAF's new rules fair? Have your say on our Facebook page. 'Ensuring a level playing field'Semenya, who carried the flag for South Africa at the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony, is hyperandrogenous -- meaning she has elevated testosterone levels. The condition has dogged her athletics career ever since she won the world 800m title as an 18-year-old in 2009.On Thursday, the double Olympic 800m champion tweeted: \"I'm 97% sure you don't like me, but I'm 100% sure I don't care.\"pic.twitter.com/fic76ojjqh\u2014 Caster Semenya (@caster800m) April 26, 2018\n\nThe new regulations, unanimously approved by the IAAF, require DSD athletes to reduce their blood testosterone level to below 5nmol/L for a continuous period of at least six months, and maintain those levels continuously for the rest of their athletic career, if they are to compete internationally. Females who do not abide by the rules will still be allowed to compete in non-international competitions or against men. Many feel the ruling will unfairly target Semenya, who was forced to undergo gender tests when she emerged onto the world stage as a teenager at the 2009 World Championships, winning the 800m in 1:55.45. But in a statement, IAAF President Sebastian Coe said Thursday that the federation had a \"responsibility to ensure a level playing field.\"\"The revised rules are not about cheating, no athlete with a DSD has cheated, they are about leveling the playing field to ensure fair and meaningful competition in the sport of athletics where success is determined by talent, dedication and hard work rather than other contributing factors,\" the Englishman added.Dutee Chand won a landmark case in 2015.The governing body introduced a testosterone limit in 2011 but in July 2015 Indian sprinter Dutee Chand won a landmark case which allowed inter-sex athletes to run without testosterone-suppressing medication.CAS suspended the IAAF's rules for two years -- that suspension was extended for a further six months in 2017 -- and asked the IAAF to show evidence that high testosterone does make a significant difference to performance. The governing body conducted a study - led by Dr. Stephane Bermon and Dr. Pierre-Yves Garnier at the 2011 and 2013 World Championships -- which claims that in certain events female athletes with high testosterone levels benefit from a 1.8% to 4.5% advantage. But an article published by the British Journal of Sports Medicine Friday, three academics described the Bermon study as \"severely flawed\".\"The IAAF have cherry-picked a few events for which a statistically significant correlation was shown in the original Bermon/Garnier study, and applied restrictions on athletes only for those events. This constitutes a seriously wrong application of scientific findings - exactly the kind that we warned against,\" the article read.",

As defender of the longest continuous international competition in sport, Team New Zealand has decided the next America's Cup will be staged in a new class of boat. Instead of the twin-hulled foiling catamarans used in Bermuda, the 2021 Cup finals in Auckland will be held in 75-feet foiling monohull yachts.

        "content": "Story highlightsThe \"eRoad\" charges electric vehicles via electrified tracks which are built into the middle of the roadThe vehicle connects to the track via a moveable arm that's connected underneath the car or truckThe innovation is being trialled by Sweden's transport administration which is attempting to go fossil fuel free by 2030 (CNN)For anyone who used to play with slot cars as a child, Sweden's new electrified road might bring back some memories. In the first of its kind, the Scandinavian country is trialling the world's first public road which allows electric vehicles to recharge while driving. Similar to a slot-car track, vehicles are able to connect to an electric rail that's embedded into the road.Sweden has a goal of achieving a completely fossil fuel free vehicle fleet by 2030, so this electrified road is part of several projects the Swedish Transport Administration has created to develop and test technologies that may be able to help the country reach its target.This eRoadArlanda is an example of a sustainable and cost-effective solution to enable the electrification of existing commercial roads.In this particular project, 'eRoadArlanda', electricity is transferred via a movable arm that attaches to the tracks built into the middle of the road. While the system is designed with the capacity to feed heavier vehicles such as trucks, it's also developed to work for cars and buses.When vehicles approach the track, a sensor from the car or truck detects the electrified rail and the movable arm lowers from underneath the vehicle and inserts into the rail. The arm has been designed to be flexible, providing the car, or truck, the freedom to move around the road without disconnecting.Read More\"One of the most important issues of our time is the question of how to make fossil-free road transportation a reality,\" Hans S\u00e4ll, chairman of the eRoadArlanda says.\"We now have a solution that will make this possible, which is amazing. Sweden is at the cutting edge of this technology, which we now hope to introduce in other areas of the country and the world.\"The electrified road, a Swedish innovation, is the first of its kind in the world and allows both commercial and passenger vehicles to be recharged while driving.The track stretches along two kilometers (1.2 miles) and has been installed on public road \"893\" just 30 minutes outside of Stockholm. The eRoad has many advantages, S\u00e4ll says. If implemented it will mean electric vehicle batteries can be smaller -- and therefore lighter -- because they won't need to retain as much charge, the vehicles will then be cheaper to manufacture and will ultimately be more sustainable.For a heavy truck to be 100% electric, he explains, it would need a battery that weighs 40 tonnes. But if technology like the eRoad was readily available, the truck's battery would be able to weigh as little as 600 kilograms.Electricity is transferred to vehicles via a movable arm that attaches to a track in the middle of the road. It would also fix a wider issue that many electric vehicle owners face: The worry and inconvenience of keeping vehicles charged.\"Today you're not 100% sure how far you can go with your battery but if you have a combination of electric roads you will feel a little bit more confident that you'll get where you want to go,\" S\u00e4ll says.The technology is also safe and adverse weather such as rain, snow and ice should not cause any major issues thanks to draining and usual maintenance. The electricity also isn't a risk to humans or animals.\"There's no electricity at the surface and the rail is only electrified if an actual authorized vehicle is passing, so if you don't have an electric vehicle that's authorized to use the electricity, the electricity will not be turned on at all -- it will not be on 24/7.\"There will also be plenty of signage around the area indicating the road is electrified and the system is equipped with safety circuits.

The Europa League remains Wenger's final chance to claim a trophy with Arsenal, and would be his first European silverware in his 21-year reign at the club, having lost the 2006 Champions League final to Barcelona.Read MoreLacazette gave Arsenal a second-half lead with a header.Lacazette joined Arsenal from French club Lyon at the start of the season.

Follow @cnnsport\n\nThe Spanish side, meanwhile, had offered little in the way of clear-cut chances, until Griezmann pounced on a misjudged clearance from Arsenal captain Laurent Koscielny, rounding the keeper and drawing the match level.

Athletics' world governing body, the IAAF, announced Thursday a separate classification for athletes of Difference of Sexual Development (DSD) which will require those athletes to reduce their blood testosterone levels -- and maintain those levels -- if they want to compete internationally. Follow @cnnsport\n\nSemenya, who carried the flag for South Africa at the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony, is hyperandrogenous -- meaning she has elevated testosterone levels -- and the condition has dogged her athletics career ever since she won the world 800m title as an 18-year-old in 2009.Earlier Thursday, double Olympic 800m champion Semenya tweeted: \"I'm 97% sure you don't like me, but I'm 100% sure I don't care.\"pic.twitter.com/fic76ojjqh\u2014 Caster Semenya (@caster800m) April 26, 2018\n\nThe new regulations, unanimously agreed by the IAAF, will cover events from 400m to the mile and come into effect from November 1, 2018. Read MoreDSD athletes will have to reduce their blood testosterone level to below 5nmol/L for a continuous period of at least six months and must maintain those levels continuously for the rest of their athletic career.  Female athletes who want to take part in international events but do not lower their testosterone levels will be allowed to compete against men.In a statement, IAAF President Sebastian Coe said that the federation had a \"responsibility to ensure a level playing field.\"\"The revised rules are not about cheating, no athlete with a DSD has cheated, they are about leveling the playing field to ensure fair and meaningful competition in the sport of athletics where success is determined by talent, dedication and hard work rather than other contributing factors,\" the Englishman added. Are the IAAF's new rules fair? Have your say on our Facebook page. 'No athlete will be forced to undergo surgery'Competing at the Commonwealth Games for the first time, Semenya won double gold for South Africa in April.The IAAF said: \"There is a broad medical and scientific consensus, supported by peer-reviewed data and evidence from the field, that the high levels of endogenous testosterone circulating in athletes with certain DSDs can significantly enhance their sporting performance. \"These Regulations accordingly permit such athletes to compete in the female classification in the events that currently appear to be most clearly affected only if they meet the Eligibility Conditions defined by these regulations.\"The governing body continued: \"Most females (including elite female athletes) have low levels of testosterone circulating naturally in their bodies (0.12 to 1.79 nmol/L in blood); while after puberty the normal male range is much higher (7.7 -- 29.4 nmol/L). \"No female would have serum levels of natural testosterone at 5 nmol/L or above unless they have DSD or a tumour. Individuals with DSDs can have very high levels of natural testosterone, extending into and even beyond the normal male range.\"Dr Stephane Bermon, from the IAAF Medical and Science Department, said in a statement: \"The latest research we have undertaken, and data we have compiled, show that there is a performance advantage in female athletes with DSD over the track distances covered by this rule.\"Dr Bermon added that the treatment to reduce testosterone levels was a hormone supplement similar to the contraceptive pill. No athlete, Dr Bermon said, would be forced to undergo surgery, adding that it would be the \"athlete's responsibility to decide on her treatment.\"A career in the spotlightSemenya emerged onto the world stage as an 18-year-old at the 2009 World Championships, winning the 800m in 1:55:45, but was forced to undergo gender tests. In 2010 she was cleared by the IAAF to compete after 11 months out of the sport.In 2011, the governing body introduced a testosterone limit but in July 2015 Indian sprinter Dutee Chand won a landmark case which allowed inter-sex athletes to run without testosterone-suppressing medication and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) suspended the IAAF's rules for two years. That suspension was extended for a further six months in 2017. Chand won a landmark case against the IAAF in 2015Semenya had her London 2012 800m silver upgraded to gold after Russia's Mariya Savinova was stripped of the title for doping. The South African went on to defend her title at Rio 2016 and a year later won 800m gold at the World Championships in London with a personal best 1:55.16 -- the 15th fastest time in history. More recently, Semenya completed a 800m and 1500m double at this month's Commonwealth Games, but the athlete has never come close to the 800m world record which has stood for 34 years.\"It's not about looking at people [and] how they look, how they speak, how they run,\" Semenya told the Sydney Morning Herald earlier this month.\"You know, it's not about being muscular. It's about sports,\" she said. \"When you walk out of your apartment, you think about performing. You don't think about how your opponents look. You just want to do better.\"",

But the biracial American actress is actually pretty magical in other ways, too.The 36-year-old seems to be more than fulfilling what fans want from a princess (even though she won't become an official princess) in a fairytale royal romance: She's smart, beautiful and passionate about humanitarian efforts around the world.Prince Harry's new fiance\u00e9 is also a rarity in Hollywood: a star who has managed to become both beloved by fans and yet so under the radar that its hard to find tabloid fodder on her.Her balance of celebrity and regular person can best be described in the story of how Prince Harry proposed.They were enjoying a cozy night at home, trying to roast a chicken for dinner, when he popped the question.Read MoreEven the most hardened royal watcher must admit that's pretty damn delightful in its quaintness and normalcy. Dating in secretThe pair revealed Monday, in their first joint interview after their engagement was announced, that their London cottage on the grounds of Kensington Palace has been a refuge.It's how they have been able to keep their relationship so private in the face of global scrutiny of anything having to do with the royal family.Markle spoke to Vanity Fair about her life and relationship with Prince Harry in an interview published in September.\"We had to sort of reverse the whole process and (have) cozy nights in, in front of the television, cooking dinner with just the two of us by ourselves in our little cottage rather going out for dinner and being seen in public,\" Prince Harry said of their dating life. \"So we, we reversed the whole process ... it's provided different opportunities. And has made us a hell of a lot closer in a short space of time.\"What the prince learned was that the Los Angeles native who once wrote that she \"lives by the ethos that most things can be cured with either yoga, the beach, or a few avocados\" has more in common with him then might be expected from one with such humble beginnings.Parental influenceLike Prince Harry, Markle was a child of divorce.Her father, Thomas Markle, and her mother, Doria Ragland, met at a Hollywood studio in the late 1970s where he was working as as a lighting director and she was a temp. Her parents split when Meghan was young, but she told Vanity Fair this year that they remain on good terms and even take vacations together as a family.Markle says her parents supported her in her quest to become an actor. \"I was doing calligraphy, and I was a hostess at a restaurant \u2014 and all those things that actors do,\" she said. \"My father knew how hard it is for an actor to get work, so he above all people was so proud that I was able to beat the odds.\"Bit roles in shows like \"CSI: Miami,\" \"90210\" and \"General Hospital\" and small parts in such films as \"Remember Me\" and \"Horrible Bosses\" kept her working before her 2011 breakthrough role as ambitious paralegal Rachel Zane in the hit TV series \"Suits,\" now in its seventh season.Markle has a lead role in TV series \"Suits\" as paralegal Rachel Zane.In a 2015 essay for Elle UK, Markle wrote about the difficulty of forging a career as a biracial actress. \"I wasn't black enough for the black roles and I wasn't white enough for the white ones, leaving me somewhere in the middle as the ethnic chameleon who couldn't book a job.\"Markle's parents had already prepared her for the challenges of being the child of a white father and black mother.She told the story of her father putting together a special Christmas gift for her when she was a little girl.\"On Christmas morning, swathed in glitter-flecked wrapping paper, there I found my Heart Family: a black mom doll, a white dad doll, and a child in each colour,\" she wrote in Elle UK. \"My dad had taken the sets apart and customised my family.\"'Proud to be a feminist'That sense of being \"other\" also helped Markle develop compassion for the disenfranchised. In another Elle essay from 2016 she wrote about how her mother, a psychotherapist and yoga instructor, raised her to be \"a global citizen, with eyes open to sometimes harsh realities.\"     No filter. Just happiness with my mama bear. #homesweethome #LA #californialove #iloveyoumom A post shared by Meghan Markle (@meghanmarkle) on May 22, 2016 at 9:25pm PDT\nMarkle has used her platform as a TV star to champion gender equality, clean-water campaigns, pet adoption and the eradication of modern day slavery.\"I'm proud to be a woman and a feminist,\" she said in a speech at a United Nations conference on International Women's Day 2015. She had just been named the UN Women's Advocate for Political Participation and Leadership.Her commitment to gender equality began many years earlier, Markle explained. As an 11-year-old she saw a soap commercial with the tagline \"women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans.\" She described how two boys in her class said that women belonged in the kitchen and how the she, \"shocked and angry,\" decided to take action in response. On the advice of her father, she wrote several letters, including one to the soap manufacturer and one to then-first lady Hillary Clinton. In the end, Markle explained, the commercial was changed: The word \"women\" was replaced with \"people.\"\"It was at that moment that I realized the magnitude of my actions,\" she said.Meghan Markle, Lady Gaga urge action on women's right to education Partners in philanthropyIn her future husband, Markle will have a strong partner in wanting to help others.In 2006, Prince Harry co-founded Sentebale, a charity to help orphans in Lesotho, Africa. He's also supported conservation efforts in Africa and has helped promote the Invictus Games, an international sporting event for wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women.And he's continued work by his mother, the late Princess Diana, in helping those suffering from AIDS and HIV.Prince Harry said in their joint interview that he believes Markle is \"capable of anything.\"\"And together, as I said, there's a hell of a lot of stuff, work that needs doing,\" he said. \"At the moment for us, it's going to be making sure that our relationship is always put first, but both of us have passions for wanting to make change, change for good.\"She said their passion for philanthropy is actually what helped led to their passion for each other.\"It was really one of the first things we connected on, it was one of the first things we started talking about when we met was just the different things that we wanted to do in the world and how passionate we were about seeing change,\" she said. \"I think ... that's what got Date 2 in the books, probably.\"Kensington Palace announced Tuesday that Markle will join Prince Harry for an event Friday marking World AIDS Day.A palace spokesperson also told CNN Tuesday that following their May 2018 wedding, Markle will become the fourth patron of The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Markle: We're 'really happy and in love'It won't be a first wedding for Markle, who was married to film producer Trevor Engelson for two years before they divorced in 2013.Interestingly, Fox is reportedly developing a TV comedy from a team, including Engelson, about a man who has to share custody with the British royal family when his ex marries a prince. Markle met her prince in July 2016 when a mutual friend set them up on a blind date.Markle and Prince Harry attend the Invictus Games in Toronto in September. They dated in secret before Prince Harry issued a rare public statement last November in which he confirmed their relationship and warned the press against harassing his girlfriend. Almost a year later Markle told Vanity Fair their relationship is simple to explain.\"We're two people who are really happy and in love,\" she said. CNN's Max Foster and Carol Jordan contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Copenhagen, Denmark (CNN)Danish inventor Peter Madsen has been found guilty of the mutilation and murder of Swedish journalist Kim Wall, and sentenced to life in prison.Madsen was found guilty on all three charges he faced: premeditated murder, the indecent handling of a corpse and \"sexual relations other than intercourse of a particularly dangerous nature,\" evidenced by stab wounds inside and outside Wall's genital area.During the sentencing at a court in Copenhagen Wednesday, the judge, Anette Burkoe, described the crime as \"a cynical and planned sexual murder of a severe brutal nature against a random woman.\" Madsen has appealed the verdict to Denmark's High Court.Peter Madsen stands next to a full-sized model of a rocket's motor section with fins in a May 31, 2017, photo.Wall, a promising 30-year-old journalist, was last seen boarding Madsen's self-built submarine in Copenhagen on August 10 last year when she had planned to interview him for an upcoming article.Read MoreInstead she disappeared and her torso washed up on an island near Copenhagen on August 21. Her head and legs were found weeks later.Madsen consistently denied charges of murder and sexual assault, claiming Wall died by accident from carbon dioxide poisoning, although he admitted to dismembering her body and tossing it into the sea in a state of panic. Explaining the verdict, Burkoe said that Madsen dismembered Wall's body in order to hide his crime and that he had not provided a reasonable explanation for the injuries found on her body or for his decision to bring a saw, screwdrivers and other items onto the UC3 Nautilus submarine.Asked on Monday if he wanted to make a last statement before the jury went into deliberation, Madsen said, \"If anything, I am sorry about what happened.\" Madsen's submarine was removed from Copenhagen habor for forensic investigation in the days after Wall disappeared.At Madsen's request, the verdict was reached by a judge and two-person jury instead of the typical six-person jury of a city court. All three were in agreement on the verdict, according to Burkoe. The prosecution had asked for Madsen to be sentenced to life in prison or placed in \"forvaring\" -- a type of preventive custody with no time limit for prisoners believed to pose a significant danger to others.Both are considered the harshest penalties in Danish law. Life sentences are rarely given in Denmark unless a person is found guilty of multiple murders.The question of forvaring or a life sentence arose based on Madsen's mental examination, which concluded that he remains dangerous, has psychopathic traits, appears unfeeling and untrustworthy, suffers from lack of empathy and is highly sexually deviant.  Details of Wall's final night unclearThe brutality of this case has kept a global spotlight on the peaceful archipelago of Denmark since Wall's disappearance last year.Submarine death suspect says heavy hatch killed reporterFor most Danes, the prospect of Madsen walking free had become inconceivable. While many of them initially knew and supported Madsen as a mad, visionary and harmless inventor, that tide has turned. In the court of public opinion the verdict was in long before the trial began. But many details of Wall's final night remain unclear and are likely to stay so unless Madsen chooses to share anything further.Madsen's explanation that the journalist died accidentally from CO2 asphyxiation on board his submarine was corroborated as plausible by one expert witness, and dismissed by another, making it difficult to prove either way. It has also been impossible to determine Wall's cause of death, and while medical examiners say it is possible she died by strangulation, or by having her throat cut, results are inconclusive.  A woman alleged to be Kim Wall stands next to a man in the tower of the private submarine UC3 Nautilus on August 10, 2017, in Copenhagen harbor. To prove his case, prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen's strategy was to paint a picture of Madsen as a man motivated by dangerous sexual motives, who moved on the fringes of sadomasochistic societies and had an unusual interest in the killing and mutilation of women. He presented a selection of more than 100 videos, cartoons and written texts found among Madsen's possessions, depicting the murder, torture and impaling of women -- in some cases real killings. The night before Wall's death, Madsen searched for and played on his phone a video of a girl having her throat slit.Buch-Jepsen also focused on Madsen's shifting explanations, witness accounts and technical and forensic evidence. According to the medical examiners there were no signs that Wall died of CO2 poisoning, several of her cuts were unrelated to the amputations of her body parts and some were inflicted prior to or shortly after she died -- challenging Madsen's story that her body was intact until he dismembered her several hours after her death. The judge said Wednesday that she and the two jurors did not believe Madsen's claim that he changed his story multiple times in order to protect her family from the \"truth.\"During the trial, defense attorney Betina Hald Engmark argued that the prosecution's case was based mainly on circumstantial evidence, none of which proved Madsen committed murder. She told the court on Monday that Madsen should receive no more than six months in prison -- for the indecent handling of a corpse, for which he admitted guilt. Remembering Kim WallFriends pay tribute to Kim Wall: 'She is more than what happened to her'Wall graduated from Columbia University and the London School of Economics and was based in Beijing and New York. At the time of her death, the journalist's work had appeared in the New York Times, the Guardian and Time magazine, among other publications.Last month, on what would have been Wall's 31st birthday, the first Kim Wall Memorial Fund grant was given to a young Danish journalist. Created by Wall's family and friends, it aims to support female reporters who cover what Wall called \"the undercurrents of rebellion.\" Three other honors have been set up in her name, including a scholarship at Columbia's Graduate School of Journalism and the Kim Wall Best Digital Reporting Award, sponsored by Google, which rewards the best stories on international affairs using creative and dynamic digital storytelling techniques.Susanne Gargiulo reported from Copenhagen and Judith Vonberg wrote from London.",

        "content": "(CNN)English football club Leeds United has drawn criticism for a planned postseason tour of Myanmar, with complaints from fans and a member of the UK parliament urging its cancellation.The criticism comes as the country falls back into international pariah status due to its treatment of the ethnic Rohingya minority in the country's western Rakhine state. More than 670,000 Rohingya Muslim refugees have fled Buddhist-majority Myanmar into neighboring Bangladesh since August 2017, bringing with them stories of murder, rape and the destruction of villages at the hands of the Myanmar military.The Yorkshire team announced the promotional tour on its website earlier in the week. The team is scheduled to compete against the Myanmar national side and a select league club in two fixtures in May, following the conclusion of the English domestic season.Read MoreUK Shadow Sports Minister Rosena Allin-Khan condemned the tour in a letter to the club's chairman, Andrea Radrizzani. I've written to @LUFC expressing my anger at their decision to hold a post-season tour in Myanmar. No UK club or organisation should promote a country which carries out state sponsored mass murder. They must rethink it, history will judge them to be on the wrong side of this. pic.twitter.com/BXzsxvpEjR\u2014 Dr Rosena Allin-Khan (@DrRosena) April 24, 2018\n\nIn the letter the Labour politician said that the \"morally corrupt\" action would legitimize the Myanmar government's refusal to engage diplomatically on what the UN has called the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya. The Leeds United tour is being planned in partnership with AYA Bank, a Myanmar financial institution. In a statement released by the club, Radrizzani said: \"It has never been my intention, nor that of the club, to get involved in a political debate in Myanmar.\"However, if because of the tour we further highlight the ongoing serious issues in certain areas of the country, then maybe that is a positive thing.\"I have spent over 10 years living in Asia and Myanmar is a country I have visited on many occasions. I am aware of the serious issues within the country, but I also know that it is a beautiful place filled with incredibly warm and welcoming people. It is somewhere very close to my heart.'Heartbreaking' details of massacre recounted Allin-Khan, who represents the London borough of Tooting, says she recently visited Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh and heard eyewitness accounts of massacres of the Muslim minority by Myanmar government troops. \"On my visits to the camps in November, I spoke to a village Imam who described, in heartbreaking detail, how he witnessed all the men from his village of 3,000 people in Myanmar being slaughtered and dismembered, the women being raped, and babies and young children being thrown, alive, onto burning fires.\"JUST WATCHEDRohingya massacre survivor left for deadReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRohingya massacre survivor left for dead 02:45In a tweet highlighting her letter to Radrizzani, she wrote: \"No UK club or organization should promote a country which carries out state sponsored mass murder.

Ronaldo's streak of scoring in 11 straight Champions League games indeed came to an end but no matter. The twice defending champions and record 12-time winners of Europe's top club competition got goals from Marcelo in the 44th minute and substitute Marco Asensio in the 57th to offset Joshua Kimmich's opener in the 28th.

With Bayern Munich leading 1-0, Marcelo began Real Madrid's comeback. And Marco Asensio scored the winner early in the second half. Yet Bayern could go into the second leg next week severely depleted: Winger Arjen Robben and central defender Jerome Boateng both limped off prior to halftime. Starting left back David Alaba was already ruled out before kickoff with a thigh injury, joining Arturo Vidal and longterm absentee Manuel Neuer. 'Very silly goal' \"We didn't score, it was tough having the setbacks of losing Robben and Boateng, and then we gave away a very silly goal before halftime,\" said Heynckes, who is expected to retire at the end of the season.\"But we created a series of really good chances and just didn't take them.

He slipped in Real Madrid's half as he delivered a pass and it was intercepted by Asensio, who exchanged passes with Lucas Vazquez before a fine left-footed finish. Marcelo's left-footed finish across goal with Bayern bossing proceedings, though, was a hammer blow to the German champions. The speedy Brazilian left back has quite the knack for scoring at big moments, doing so in the round of 16 against Paris Saint-Germain and last eight against Juventus -- when Ronaldo needed to convert  an injury-time penalty in the second leg in Madrid to fend off a fightback from the 'Old Lady' of Italian football. \"We know that the tie cannot be over after one leg,\" said Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane. \"But after the Juventus match, we know we'll need to approach the Bayern result differently, otherwise things could go badly for us.\"JUST WATCHEDCOPA90: Thomas M\u00fcller's path to Bayern legendReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCOPA90: Thomas M\u00fcller's path to Bayern legend 04:54Marcelo was culpable on the opening goal of the game, his area of the pitch vacated as Kimmich raced forward.

Navas would somewhat atone for his gaffe by stopping Franck Ribery in the 59th minute and then again four minutes later. \"Bayern's goal was a consequence of several people making mistakes, not just Navas,\" said Zidane. \"He was very good in the second half.\" Wasteful But Zidane and his side were let off the hook by Bayern's wasteful finishing. Ribery's heavy touch when in all alone handed Real a reprieve shortly after Kimmich's strike. German international Thomas Muller -- so prolific in the Champions League -- went wide and marksman Robert Lewandowski headed the ball straight to Navas in the moments after Marcelo's leveler as Bayern looked to respond immediately. In the 66th minute, Lewandowski and Muller collided yards from goal to prevent a likely equalizer  from the latter and the Polish striker fluffed his chance in the 88th minute with only Navas to beat. Ronaldo barely had a touch meanwhile, though did show off his skills by striking a left-footed effort into the net in the 71st minute. The only problem was that the Portuguese took the ball down with his arm.

        "content": "(CNN)Thousands of people across Germany marched Wednesday in solidarity with the country's Jewish community  amid rising concerns over anti-Semitism.A day after Josef Schuster, head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, warned against Jewish men wearing a kippa (skullcap) in public, demonstrators wore the head covering in a gesture of solidarity.The largest event took place in Berlin, with other demonstrations held across the country in Erfurt, Potsdam and Cologne -- with people of different faiths coming together.A Muslim woman fixes a kippa on her head during a demonstration.Schuster's remarks came after last week's anti-Semitic attack in Berlin that targeted two men wearing kippas.According to the latest figures published by the Interior Ministry, there were 1,468 anti-Semitic attacks carried out in Germany in 2016.Read MoreThe report says that 1,381 of those attacks were committed by people associated with the far right. Students against the far rightThe demonstrations take place at a time where there is growing concern over the influence of the far-right AfD (Alternative for Germany) party, the largest opposition in Parliament. Standing on an anti-immigration, anti-Islam platform, it won 12.6% of the vote, a result described by leading party figures as a \"political earthquake.\"But the AfD has also courted controversy within the Jewish community, most  notoriously when Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, former leader of the party in the eastern state of Thuringia, was expelled after condemning the presence of a Holocaust memorial in the city of Berlin while urging Germany to stop atoning for its Nazi war crimes. A man shows a kippa during the rally in Berlin.While the AfD has sought to position itself as friendly toward the Jewish community -- a senior member told Reuters it has warned of anti-Semitism by Muslims -- many are not convinced.Last Sunday, the Union of Jewish Students met in Frankfurt, where they voted through a policy ruling that it would have nothing do with the party.\"I grew up in Jewish institutions. I went to Jewish Kindergarten, Jewish high school, I'm leading the Jewish Student Union,\" Dalia Grinfeld, president of the Jewish Student Union of Germany, told CNN.\"I feel that if we didn't have the security measures we have, police in front of every Jewish institution, then we wouldn't have the life here. Because of the AfD, we can never stay safe here.\" People of different faiths wear the kippa during a demonstration against antisemitism in Erfurt.Grinfeld says the AfD is attempting to camouflage its racism by offering its support to the Jewish community -- support she says it does not want.\"As Jewish people, we do feel as if we are used by the AfD,\" she told CNN.\"It's as if they're trying to say, 'we stand with the Jews' but we don't' want them because of their fake solidarity. It's not real solidarity .\"If you demand that ritual slaughter is not allowed and argue against freedom of religious rights in Germany. then you can't be a friend of the Jewish people. \"They try to use the 'We stand with the Jews so we can't be racist, we're not anti-Semitic' line, which is of course what they are.\"Anti-Semitic attackLast week's attack in Berlin, which was captured on video, caused huge shock within in Germany.The footage shows the attacker, a Syrian refugee, shouting \"yahudi\" -- the Arabic word for Jew -- while lashing the victim with his belt.The victim, Adam Armoush, a 21-year-old Israeli who is not Jewish, told German media that he had worn the kippa in an attempt to prove that Berlin did not have an anti-Semitic atmosphere. Days later, Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned the attack while expressing concern over the emergence of \"another form of anti-Semitism,\" aside from that perpetrated by the far right.In April, the German government appointed Felix Klein as its first special envoy to monitor and combat anti-Semitism.This kippa in Berlin symbolizes solidarity.\"Anti-Semitism did not need to be imported into Germany -- it was always there,\" Marcel Dirsus, political scientist at the University of Kiel, told CNN.\"But now Jews in Germany are faced with a resurgent far right as well as a new kind of anti-Semitism that is the result of immigration from the Arab world.\"Some opponents of Merkel's refugee policy are using a string of recent anti-Semitic incidents to attack her stance. Some supporters of her open-door policy deny that immigration from Muslim majority countries and a surge in anti-semitism are at all related.\"Germany needs to make that Jews can feel safe in Berlin, Hamburg or Munich. To do so, Germans will need to make tough choices,\" Dirsus said.'More significance'Crowds also gathered in Cologne to lend their support to the local Jewish community.Haven't seen so many kippas in public since my Bar Mitzvah.K\u00f6lle \u2665\ufe0f#KippaColonia #BerlinTr\u00e4gtKippa pic.twitter.com/EZAUB9wS7n\u2014 Felix Tamsut (@ftamsut) April 25, 2018\n\n\"I feel like being a Jew in Germany nowadays is something that carries a bit more significance than it did a couple of years ago,\" Felix Tamsut told CNN from the demonstration in Cologne.\"I feel as if the atmosphere has changed. People talk about the wave of Muslim immigration but the risk also comes from extreme right-wing.\"That's where most anti-Semitic crime in Germany comes from. Anti-Semitism is on the rise and sentiments which haven't been made public before are now being made public because of the rise of the AfD.\"Tamsut feels that the success of the AfD has emboldened anti-Semites and allowed them to voice their opinion without shame.JUST WATCHED67,000 stones and counting for Holocaust victimsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH67,000 stones and counting for Holocaust victims 03:27He also rejects far-right rhetoric, which blames the attacks on asylum seekers fleeing from Arab nations.\"I've met many refugees personally and I'm proud to call them my friends but the problem is for a lot of them is that they'd never met a Jew before,\" Tamsut added.\"They don't know what we stand for or who we are. They just assume. That's not true for everyone, but it is for a significant amount.\"For the right wing, it's more problematic and it's not going away. It's on the rise, and as a secular Jew who lives the life of an average citizen here in Germany, the right wing sometimes scares me.\"",

        "content": "Liverpool (CNN)Mohamed Salah is smiling.It's an expression that those who have watched the English Premier League over the past eight months have grown accustomed to.Sitting down inside Liverpool's Anfield Stadium the day after scoring a key goal in the Champions League quarterfinal second leg, Salah is in a relaxed mood.Follow @cnnsport\n\nLess than 12 hours earlier, Salah had scored his 39th goal of the season in Liverpool's 2-1 win over Manchester City, sending the club through to the last four of European football's most prestigious competition.Wearing a black hooded jumper and ripped skinny black jeans, he slowly finishes off his coffee as he looks out across the Anfield turf after a recovery session at the nearby training ground.Read More\"I love that when I was a kid that I was playing the PlayStation as Liverpool,\" Salah jokes.For those who have been fortunate enough to watch Salah this season, it would not be an exaggeration to suggest that some of his performances have appeared to be from a virtual reality.His searing pace -- which would have left most game console players with repetitive strain injury in their constant pressing of the buttons on their handset -- has been complemented by unerring accuracy in front of goal.And yet, for many who have followed English football, Salah's exploits have come as something of a surprise.JUST WATCHEDMo Salah: We can win the Champions LeagueReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMo Salah: We can win the Champions League 02:59Salah is not shy in his assessment that he was rarely given a chance during an ill-fated spell with Chelsea in 2014 under then coach Jose Mourinho.Fortunately for Salah, since returning to these shores from Italian club Roma for a then club-record fee of $49 million in June 2017, he has been something of a phenomenon.But Salah, though, determined and ambitious, does not crow about his achievements even when comparisons are drawn with Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.\"I'll leave that for the people to decide,\" he says when asked if he's the third best player in the world.Salah gives CNN a tour of Anfield stadium.Microphones off, and the piercing wind biting through the holes in his jeans, Salah makes his way back inside to the relative warmth of the corporate box.From there, it's into the car and a short drive to the next venue for our interview, the Aloft Hotel on North John Street.Cars don't interest him, Salah says. But food does, which is fortunate given that the next part of the interview takes place over dinner.Eating kushari in EgyptHeads turn and murmuring starts as he begins to walk towards the table, though this is something Salah has grown accustomed to since he arrived on Merseyside. Salah celebrates after scoring against Manchester City in the quarterfinal second leg.Salah sits down and proceeds to order the salmon fillet, which comes with rainbow carrots, samphire, smoked leek and potato puree.It's fair to say that he has yet to find British cuisine to his taste, though he confesses he has tried a traditional pie as well as fish and chips. Neither have really hit the spot, he concedes.Salah watches a video message from his first coach back in Egypt while waiting for dinner.\"Nutrition is so important, it's part of the game,\" he says. \"It has helped with my recovery, allowed me to sleep better and helped my body adapt quickly.\"He adds, \"My nutritionist says that because I don't have any fat on my body, I can eat what I want. I also don't drink so it's fine.\"Salah vies for the ball against Congo's Tobias Badila during their World Cup qualifying game.Instead, he prefers an Egyptian dish called kushari, which is made from rice, pasta and lentils, topped with tomato sauce, chickpeas and fried onion.\"When I go back to Egypt, I call my friend from the airport to buy kushari for us to eat in the car,\" he says.\"I pull my hoodie over my head, jump into the car and then I'm eating it straight away.\"Talk of Egypt and home is common during the conversation and not just for the food, either.Salah's success in England is a source of immense pride to those back home in Egypt. In fact, according to reports, such is the adulation being heaped upon Salah that it earned him hundreds and thousands of write-in votes in March's presidential election.Egypt fans with a Salah banner \nduring the recent game with Portugal.So, perhaps it's with little surprise that he prefers to keep himself to himself when he does return home in a bid to escape the public glare.But Salah is aware of his status in Egypt, a status which was further increased by the 95th-minute penalty he scored for the national team in October to send his country to its first World Cup since 1990.And it's also why he has taken a role in an anti-drugs campaign back in Egypt in an attempt to use his platform for good.\"It's a big responsibility,\" he says of the expectations placed upon him. \"I feel it.\"Salah will lead Egypt's World Cup challenge in Russia this summer.Egypt's size, alone, indicates how many eyes are watching him. \"If you talk only about Egypt, we are 100 million,\" he says. \"I have to be natural and not doing anything fake, not lying on social media, in interviews and life.\"This is my life, it's an easy life. It's not complicated. I have nothing much to do during the day but it's a responsibility in the end.\"It requires some balance, which Salah alternately notes and then downplays.\"You have to take it easy and carry on. I'm not nervous about that,\" he says. \"It's also a little bit difficult because you don't have the freedom to make mistakes or something wrong.\"That's pressure but when you've been under pressure for many years you can deal with it. It's fine.\"Pressure and expectationsIf there is any pressure on Salah, he does not show it.Egyptians gather at a cafe near a graffiti of Salah in Cairo.Calm, relaxed and happy to talk, he does not appear to be fazed by the increased pressure being heaped upon his shoulders.For Egypt, he represents the jewel in the crown of its national team and the man upon all hopes rest.But his more immediate task is to help steer Liverpool past his former employer Roma, and towards a sixth European Cup, its first since 2005.Liverpool came from 3-0 down to finish 3-3 with AC Milan before winning the 2005 Champions League on penalties.On Tuesday, Salah scored two goals and assisted two more as Liverpool took a commanding 5-2 first-leg lead against the Italians.Liverpool has moved through the competition unbeaten so far, and its victory over Premier League champion Manchester City underlined its credentials in Europe's most prestigious cup competition.But as Salah's goal tally has grown -- he has scored 10 in the competition so far -- so too, have expectations.Expectations that will soar even further now that he's been named as Player of the Year by his fellow professionals.\"It makes me work harder,\" he says of the fans' expectations. \"It makes me give everything, more than before because now there's more pressure. Everyone is looking for you to do something. When I didn't score in one game, they said: 'Wow, he's playing badly'.\"He adds: \"Everyone is expecting something in each game I'm playing. I don't have to score in every game but I want to do my best. I want to give everything for the club for my teammates and myself also.\"'Is that Mo Salah?'It's not just Liverpool fans who have taken Salah to heart though; the entire city appears to have adopted him.Mo Salah and Becky Anderson take a stroll around Albert Docks.Walking along Albert Docks the following day, crowds begin to gather excitedly as they catch a glimpse of Salah.Diners come out of restaurants to take their photos, while others look once, and then glance back almost immediately with a look that says, \"No, it can't be.\"\"Is that Mo Salah?\" one man says excitedly while trying to take a photo, his finger constantly slipping across the wrong buttons as the windows on his phone open and close.\"I'm an Everton fan but you've got to appreciate what Salah's done this season,\" an onlooker tells CNN.\"My wife's a Liverpool fan and she absolutely loves him.\"Looking on, the man's wife just seems to have become overwhelmed with shock. \"This is just amazing,\" she says excitedly.Salah and Becky Anderson spend time at the Beatles Museum in Liverpool.As the crowd grows, Salah just carries on with his walk, talking to CNN and stopping for photos with well wishers.\"He has been absolutely brilliant,\" a local taxi driver tells CNN. \"What he has achieved this season, is phenomenal. I don't think anybody thought he would have this impact.\"Just as Liverpool has taken to Salah, Salah has taken to Liverpool.He talks about a city which has made him feel at home and of a community which has been welcoming and respectful, though he concedes that understanding the local accent remains a challenge.Videos of the fans chanting Salah's name have gone viral, and are even popular inside the locker room with his teammates. \"It's a great feeling to have felt the love from my first day here,\" he says of his time in Liverpool. \"It's a special feeling for me. It's something that makes me work harder, think more positive and everyone is looking at you to do something every game.\"He reflects again on the expectations pressed upon him. \"It's also more pressure but it's something huge to be here in this city. It's something different.\" Liverpool legendWalking across to the nearby Beatles Museum, one of the city's most popular tourist landmarks, Salah again stops for photos and high fives while one lady simply shouts: \"I love you.\"Mo Salah treats the crowd to an impromptu drum solo.\"That's Mo Salah, isn't it?\" a gentleman asks his partner while trying to crane his neck to get a better view?\"Mo Farah? That's not Mo Farah,\" she says dismissively as Salah walks down the steps and into the entrance.Inside the museum, home to all you would ever want to or need to know about the Beatles, Salah's presence is beginning to distract a few of the visitors.Salah takes a look around the exhibits at the Beatles Museum. For one group of school children, the excitement is just too much.\"Is that Mo Salah? Is that Mo Salah? I love Mo Salah!\" says one schoolboy who is visiting with his class from North Wales.The group of schoolchildren begin to serenade him with another Mo Salah song, while managing to get closer to him than many Premier League defenders have managed this season before snapping a selfie.As the children watch Salah perform a short drum solo, their teachers attempt to handle the growing sense of excitement while simultaneously recognizing that any hopes they had of their class concentrating on their lesson plan had been blown away.Salah pauses for a selfie with a fan while walking by the River Mersey.Leaving the group behind, Salah walks on, taking in the photos and music of Liverpool's most famous band before making the short drive to the Beatles statue on the waterfront.After pausing for more photos, he finally lines up alongside John, Paul, George and Ringo.Salah lines up alongside the Beatles statue on Liverpool Waterfront.Could the leader of Liverpool's \"Fab Three\" share a statue one day along with fellow forwards Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane?For now, Salah just laughs.

        "content": "Story highlightsTodd Clever won 76 caps for USA, scoring 16 triesPlayed in three World Cups for the EaglesAlan Dymock is the Features Editor for Rugby World magazine. (CNN)Two years ago, while he was still captain of the USA national team, rugby star Todd Clever was approached by World Wrestling Entertainment to see if he would like to try his hand in the ring. He declined at the time. But in February this year, WWE hit-up Clever again. Having not long retired from test rugby, he thought: \"Why not?\"The former Eagles back-row, 35, explains: \"I was contacted by the WWE and asked if I had any interest and wanted to come out (to try out). I was playing at the time so all of my focus was being an athlete for rugby.Follow @cnnsport\n\n\"Once I retired, I guess they caught wind or something happened I got calls and another invite.\"That's my whole thing. You don't want to have any regrets in life, from missing out on experiences. That's why I'm always saying yes to going on social rugby tours now, even if it costs me money now. I still have a blast doing it. Read More\"So when this happened, I didn't want to miss out on anything, so I said yeah, and I went out there for a week. I absolutely loved my time there in Orlando, Florida. It was brilliant.

However, while no contract has been signed, talks are ongoing between Clever and WWE and the ex-flanker is optimistic. Before the Clever news became official, earlier in the year social media was abuzz with word of talent scouts looking to rugby for the next superstar.While current and ex-players excitedly chattered about who could cut it in wrestling and what finishers each test star could use, Clever kept quiet.\"When those things came out, it was funny because I was tagged on social media from a dozen different people saying, 'Yo, there's a talent agency looking for ...' whatever else,\" he recalls with a smile. \"I kept it under my breath, but things were already in motion. I had my flights booked over there and everything else. I was laughing it off. \"I think WWE is all about hitting new markets and the entertainment side. So crossover athletes are nothing new for them. They've had guys from the NBA or NFL and obviously with the growth and rise of rugby -- in the States, sure, but overseas as well -- they want to tap into the market.\"And obviously rugby players are amazing athletes. So I think there's a mutual benefit for both sides.\"JUST WATCHEDDan Carter on Japanese rugby and New ZealandReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHDan Carter on Japanese rugby and New Zealand 03:10Clever, born in San Jose, California, has been a familiar face on the world scene for some time.He is best known for his 15-year stint with the Eagles, although he was embroiled in controversy when he missed out on World Cup 2015, with the staff at the time claiming it was due to \"conduct violations.\" Clever, who returned to the fold in 2016, simply says that he is not the type to just say \"Yes, sir,\" and that he was, and always will be, one to look out for teammates and call-out poor leadership. A World Cup should be the pinnacle of players' careers, but the way they were managed in 2015 disappointed Clever. He has also played all over the world, not just in the US and in the global invitational, social tournaments he now loves. He has played Super Rugby with the Lions of South Africa, in Japan's Top League, and with England's Newcastle Falcons.He laughs in agreement when it is put to him that he may have a drifter's spirit.

I had a tour of the facility, a meeting with some of the guys and they asked me: 'Do you just wanna watch; how do you want to do this?' I was keen to get stuck in. I flew across the country so I wanted to work out.\"I did some strength and conditioning sessions with one of the smaller groups of athletes and later that day I jumped in the ring. So I was in the ring for a few days and, doing some tumbling, some rolling, some wrestling. It was good. \"For warm-ups there's a big stretch, but you're doing cartwheels and somersaults and while I was doing it I thought: 'I wasn't really expecting this.'

So I just got in amongst it and I surprisingly did a lot better than I thought I would.\" Comparing wrestling training to the rigors and occasional monotony of rugby training, he continues: \"It's different in the sense it's an individual sport and it's entertainment, obviously.\"With rugby, it's all for the team, for bettering the person inside or outside of you, as a whole. There it's set up for yourself. There's a spotlight on the individual's showmanship, rather than the team outcome.\"Clever still very much loves rugby. Just last week, he received an unexpected route back into the game by signing a contract with the new Austin Elite professional side in Texas. The team is part of the brand new Major League Rugby season, which got under way last weekend.He is also helping out with academies, helping to nail down a pathway for American youths to progress towards this new elite league and ultimately the Eagles test team.Clever's contract, however, includes a clause and he has another meeting with the WWE in May. If the offer to step into the ring made financial sense, he would take it.The native Californian, who is on the USA Rugby board, is also helping out with preparations for the Sevens World Cup in San Francisco in July.He will be dropping in on the San Francisco Giants baseball franchise from time to time as they prepare to host the sevens event at AT&T Park. Clever is also excited about the Rugby Night being hosted there on May 14, as the Giants take on the Cincinnati Reds.Visit cnn.com/rugby for more news and videosWith Clever so well-known in rugby circles and with him now the first rugby player to be considered for a spot in the ring, it's pertinent to ask him something else. Does he see himself as a \"face\" (good guy) or a \"heal\" (bad guy) in wrestling?With a chuckle he says: \"Well through my rugby career I think I've had a bit of both sides of it. The important thing for me is being true to myself and what I'm all about!\"",

That first Mane chance, though it wasn't taken, felt like the watershed moment in the first half.Wave after wave of red shirts began descending on Roma's back line; every lunge increasingly desperate, every tackle increasingly last ditch.It wasn't long before Liverpool's star man, Salah, got in on the act, cutting inside and curling a shot which was palmed away by Alisson at full stretch.Roma naively didn't heed that warning, again allowing Salah to cut inside onto that magical left foot.JUST WATCHEDMo Salah: We can win the Champions LeagueReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMo Salah: We can win the Champions League 02:59This time it was inch perfect, the ball kissing the underside of the crossbar as the scrambling Alisson looked helplessly upwards.There was a brief intake of breath, a split second of silence as the 54,000 watching fans heard the noise of ball against woodwork, before Anfield -- which up to this point had been simmering nicely -- exploded into life.Salah, facing his former employers for the first time since his summer transfer to Merseyside, immediately turned to where the away fans were congregated and put his hands together, asking for forgiveness.Bar the small pocket of Roma fans in the corner of the crowd, Anfield was delirious and the Liverpool players responded to a crowd which now was baying for more Roma blood.Again they came forward, this time Firmino crashed through a weak tackle from Kostas Manolas -- Roma's hero from their second-leg quarterfinal comeback against Barcelona -- and threaded a pass through to Salah.With his first touch, the Egyptian dragged the ball into his path; with his second, he nonchalantly clipped it over the onrushing Alisson.For a moment it looked as though the backtracking Juan Jesus might be able to save Roma, but the wet turf quickly coaxed the ball over the line.Roma made a substitution at the start of the second half, Patrik Schick replacing Under, in what proved to be a futile attempt to stem the tide.JUST WATCHEDCOPA90: Mo Salah, Liverpool's Egyptian KingReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCOPA90: Mo Salah, Liverpool's Egyptian King 03:04With less than 10 minutes on the clock, Salah turned provider, putting a pass on a plate for Mane to divert the ball into the far corner.Roma spent Monday night in Liverpool's Titanic Hotel, and the Italians were now sinking much faster.With Liverpool toying with their opponents and with one foot in the final in Kiev, Salah again burst down the right and this time played a pass across the face of goal which Firmino tapped into an empty net.Despite two goals and two assists to his name, Salah was still being allowed to roam free down the right flank with barely a Roma defender in sight.Liverpool then looked to hammer the final nail into Roma's coffin, as Firmino headed home his second goal of the game from James Milner's corner.Based on the mood around the ground and the swagger with which the Liverpool players were strutting around the pitch, you got the sense this tie was over.Perhaps it was that complacency, then, that allowed Roma to inexplicably breathe life into this semifinal.Liverpool fans welcome the team bus to Anfield before the game.With barely a shot to their name in the entire match, two goals in the space of four minutes -- the first a tidy finish from Dzeko, the second Perotti's penalty -- put a spring in the step of those Roma fans who had looked utterly dejected up until this point.The mood inside Anfield had now shifted completely. Barely minutes ago, the place had been rocking. Now there were nerves as Liverpool's much-maligned leaky defence again began to show its fragility.Klopp's final change, defender Ragnar Klavan for two-goal Firmino, mirrored the growing anxiety around the ground.When the final whistle blew, it wasn't met with the same euphoria had it been blown just 10 minutes earlier, but Liverpool can still certainly be pleased with their night's work.Though Roma's two late goals slightly soured an otherwise incredible Champions League night at Anfield, it will take a monumental effort if the Italians are to overturn a second consecutive three-goal deficit -- in particular with Salah in the opposition line up.But they did it against Lionel Messi and Barcelona. Who is to say they can't do it again?",

Her season peaked in October, when she won her 36th career title in Tianjin, China. However, still hampered by a forearm injury, 2018 has been a frustrating year for Sharapova, who has won just five matches  in four events, including back-to-back defeats in the opening rounds in Doha in February and in Indian Wells, California in March.'Results-oriented'\"One of the great things which I do love about [sports], which at the same time is incredibly difficult to take, is that a lot of sport is very results-oriented,\" Sharapova said. \"So you can feel like you are moving forward although you lose a match, and the fact you are losing a match is making you feel like you are regressing,\" she said.Sharapova celebrates after winning the first tournament since coming back from a drugs ban at the Tianjin Open in China. Still, Sharapova's famously steely determination in the face of adversity has not waned. \"In terms of where my mind is, my motivation and the desire that I have for what I continue now when I am on center court, when I am away from the court and I have moments where my body feels like it's not where it should be, where I am not healthy, or where it is just a day where I feel like being somewhere else, I still get through it, and I find a way to get through it and to me, that's the best sign,\" she said.READ: Sharapova's comeback leaves women's tour dividedClay season -- a new start?After losing to eventual champion Naomi Osaka in Indian Wells, Sharapova announced she had parted ways with her long-time coach, Sven Groeneveld, after four years.

A three-time winner on the indoor clay of Stuttgart, which is sponsored by her long-time endorser, Porsche, Sharapova will play seventh-ranked Caroline Garcia of France in the opening round. She will do so with former coach Thomas Hogstedt by her side. The Swede had guided Sharapova to complete the career grand slam of all four majors with victory at the 2012 French Open. It was also her first major victory since a shoulder injury nearly ended her career in 2008.MotivationAlthough Sharapova has become a successful businesswoman since winning Wimbledon in 2004 at the age of 17, earning close to $300 million according to Forbes in on-and-off-court earnings from endorsements, exhibitions, royalties and businesses including her own candy and chocolate brand, nothing will ever come close to competing for the biggest prizes in tennis.Sharapova became a global star virtually overnight after beating Serena Williams in the 2004 Wimbledon finals. \"Being in that moment of winning and that last point of a match, especially in a grand slam final, is extraordinary,\" she said. \"And I've experienced it five times in my life and I've been playing this sport since I was four years old. It's very, very different.\"JUST WATCHEDMaria Sharapova's debated return to US Open ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMaria Sharapova's debated return to US Open  01:39RetirementAlthough she turned pro at the age of 14, Sharapova isn't thinking about retirement just yet.\"I haven't set a time table for myself, but I've always said that I would do it on my own terms,\" she said. \"And when I say 'on my own terms,' so many questions are goal oriented. You start a season and it's like what's your goal?\"\"When you've experienced grand slam victories, it's absolutely natural to have that goal in your mind,\" she said.\"It would be silly for me to say my goal for this year is to win a lower-tier tournament because I strive to be on the big stage and to win on the big stage.\"I've experienced it, and I know what it's like and I want that feeling again. I continue to work for that.\"JUST WATCHEDSharapova's return to the grand slam stageReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSharapova's return to the grand slam stage 01:352020 Tokyo Olympics?\"There's been a lot of talk of the Olympics and Japan, and some people are saying I'm going to go to the Olympics and some people say no,\" said Sharapova, who missed the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing because of a shoulder injury and didn't compete at  the 2016 Rio Olympics because of the suspension.\"And it's funny when people speak about you, when you actually don't know when that time will be,\" she said\"I'd love to play in another Olympics, but I don't know if that will happen and at this point in 2018, I don't really want to know.

First elected in 2008, he served as the country's head of state until he was appointed prime minister earlier this month. Armenian policemen detain an opposition supporter during a rally in central Yerevan on April 21, 2018, held to protest former president Serzh Sargsyan's election as prime minister.Over the weekend Nikol Pashinyan, an opposition MP and leader of the protests, was arrested but was released Monday shortly before the announcement. \"Nikol Pashinyan was right. I was wrong,\" Sargsyan said in a statement published on the state-owned Armenpress website. \"The situation has several solutions, but I will not take any of them. That is not mine. I am leaving office of the country's leader, of Prime Minister. The street movement is against my tenure. I am fulfilling your demand.

        "content": "Paris (CNN)It was last July that US President Donald Trump laid bare the depth of his feelings for his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron.For Trump, it was not the romantic dinner at the prestigious Le Jules Verne restaurant inside the Eiffel Tower, nor the rendition of Daft Punk's \"Get Lucky\" by a marching band that impressed, but that remarkable 29-second handshake.Perhaps what appeared at first to be two men attempting to assert their own alpha male credentials was actually a sign of respect and admiration.Whatever the case, by the time Trump left Paris after a whirlwind 36 hours that included a spectacular Bastille Day parade, he was sold on Macron.     \"He's a great guy. Smart. Strong. Loves holding my hand,\" Trump told the New York Times after his visit to Paris.Read More\"People don't realize he loves holding my hand. And that's good, as far as that goes.\"\"I mean, really. He's a very good person,\" Trump went on. \"And a tough guy, but look, he has to be. I think he is going to be a terrific president of France. But he does love holding my hand.\"Trump backed his comments up further in January when he afforded Macron the honor of being the first foreign leader invited for a state visit by the Trump administration.The three-day visit, which begins on Monday, comes at a time when the pair are working to strengthen ties between their nations. Beyond the bravadoAt first glance, the relationship between Trump, a 71-year-old isolationist who enjoys cable news and long days on the golf course, and the 40-year-old Macron, a pro-European integrationist who likes to quote philosophers and extol the virtues of the arts, seems unlikely.Indeed, their relationship got off to a rocky start at last May's NATO summit in Brussels, when Macron appeared to ignore Trump's outstretched hand and greeted German Chancellor Angela Merkel instead.When the two did eventually shake hands, it was one that went viral online, with neither man ceding any ground.\n\n\nBut looking beyond the handshake and the bravado, the two men share a number of similarities.Both based their presidential campaigns on being outsiders and enemies of the political elite. They took advantage of the public's dissatisfaction and disillusionment with mainstream political parties en route to winning their respective elections.Trump, a real estate mogul, and Macron, a former investment banker, are both drawn to sealing good deals. And they share a penchant for symbolism and showmanship, whether it be appearing on reality television or holding meetings amid the splendor of the Palace of Versailles.And both men married women whom they are 24 years apart from -- Melania Trump is almost 24 years younger than the US President, and Brigitte Trogneux is roughly 24 years older than Macron.The pair also share views on policy, notably on eliminating ISIS and battling against global terrorism.More recently, Trump and Macron have been working together on eliminating Syria's chemical weapons capabilities.This sense of potential cooperation has helped frame forthcoming talks as somewhat crucial, not only in terms of policy, but also in helping to reestablish what has been a historically strong US-France partnership.Taking on TrumpFor Macron, the stars have aligned. While British Prime Minister Theresa May has had to fend off criticism over her courtship of Trump, Macron has seen no need to hold back and has presented himself as Europe's spokesman.     Trump is hardly popular in France, but Macron has faced little opposition to his decision to keep close ties with Washington and further his position as Trump's \"interpreter,\" as aides have put it.Macron has not been shy about criticizing Trump, most notably over the US decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord and the American President's derogatory comments about Africa.While other European leaders have been reticent about indulging Trump, Macron has managed to cut through the noise. But his status as the European leader with perhaps the most influence in the White House will be put to the test this week on a number of fronts. In an interview with Fox News that aired Sunday, the French President suggested it would be a mistake for Trump to ditch the nuclear deal with Iran, and urged his counterpart to continue to exempt Europe from tariffs.  \"You cannot make a trade war with your allies,\" Macron said. \"It's too complicated if you make war against everybody, you make trade war against China, trade war against Europe, war in Syria, war against Iran, it doesn't work. You need allies.\"Trump has been an outspoken critic of the deal, agreed by his predecessor, to curtail Tehran's nuclear ambitions, labeling it a \"major embarrassment\" for the US.He has warned France, Britain and Germany that they must \"fix the terrible flaws\" of the agreement by May 12 or he would refuse to honor the sanctions relief Iran was promised.Macron will make Europe's case for remaining in the Joint Commission Plan of Action, the formal name for the Iran nuclear deal, with a failure to reach a deal likely to harm relations between the US and European Union.In anticipation of his visit to Washington, Macron held talks with Merkel. Both leaders are keen to ensure that Trump extends a waiver for US tariffs on European steel and aluminum.That may be difficult. Last month Trump launched a scathing attack on the EU, claiming its trade policies have \"been brutal\" to the US after announcing a 25% tariff on steel and 10% tariff on aluminum imports.He added that the EU had \"banded together in order to beat the United States in trade.\"Those comments caused an angry reaction in Europe, which will be hoping that Macron can change Trump's mind.Macron vindicated?Macron's trip to the White House is likely to be a litmus test of his Trump strategy, as well as his ability to negotiate on behalf of French interests overseas. Maron stands next to Trump as they pose for a photo at the G20 in Gemany last July.\nA year into his tenure as President, Macron has succeeded in reinforcing France's status as -- in Trump's words -- the \"first and oldest ally\" of the US. What is hard to miss is the fact that this new \"special relationship\" was forged by two political newcomers, both of whom are determined to shake up the system through a cult of personality.  The chemistry between the two men has propelled the partnership forward at a time when Trump has failed to forge a close bond with the leaders of the UK or Germany. While May and Merkel look on, Macron has the opportunity to cement France's place at the top table with the Trump administration and, in so doing, continue his pursuit of being Europe's leading man.CNN's Melissa Bell reported from Paris. James Masters wrote from London.",

A lot, if you happen to be a member of Britain's royal family.As the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on Monday announced the arrival of their son and third child, speculation turned to a possible name.The baby boy was born at St. Mary's Hospital in London at 11 a.m. local time, Kensington Palace said in a statement. Duchess of Cambridge gives birth to a baby boyBut as with the royal couple's older children, Prince George, 4, and Princess Charlotte, 2, it is likely to be a few days until a name is announced.Among the bookmaker's favorites for the boy, who will be fifth in line to the throne, are Arthur, Albert and James. Read MoreTradition plays a huge role when choosing a royal name. Albert could be a nod to both Queen Victoria's husband, Prince Albert, and Queen Elizabeth II's father, King George VI, who was called Albert until his accession to the throne. \"We haven't had so many called Arthur, but it does hark back to the mythical first king of Britain,\" said royal commentator Kate Williams.     Given Prince William and Catherine's previous choices, royal commentators are predicting the couple will stick with a traditional name for their third child. \"George and Charlotte are very traditional, historic, English names,\" said Williams. \"Although this is slightly different in that their first child, Prince George, is likely to be the monarch, and this child will likely not. So they can be a little bit different with the name.\"The latest edition to the royal family is fifth in line to the throne -- after his grandfather Prince Charles, father William and two siblings -- bumping William's brother Prince Harry further down the order. A change in the law in 2011, after William and Kate were married, gave women the same rights of accession to the throne as men.Whichever name the Duke and Duchess choose, it will first need to be cleared with Queen Elizabeth II, though ultimately the final decision rests with the parents.\"The Queen has the power to say what their title is -- she'll decree that they are the Prince of Cambridge,\" explained Williams.\"But in the case of names, it is more of an informal conversation. Of course they have such respect for the Queen that if she says 'I really don't like that name,'  they'd definitely take that into account,\" Williams added.Royal fans wait behind barriers outside St Mary's Hospital ahead of the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's third child.Police officers stand guard outside the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital ahead of the birth.One thing is certain, their chosen name is likely to shoot to the top of British baby name lists -- as it did with George and Charlotte. And with the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle set to take place on May 19, Williams had one final prediction: \"I wouldn't be surprised if Harry and Meghan are popular baby names in the coming year.\"",

Sargsyan had previously served two five-year terms as president and critics say his prime ministerial role could give him the power to stay in office too long.Protesters have been rallying over fears the government is becoming more authoritarian and the last few days hundreds of demonstrators have been detained, including 70 on Saturday, according to RFE/RL.Sargsyan posted a message on his website Saturday acknowledging the demonstrations over the past week and saying the authorities respected Armenians' right to protest but that some gatherings had been unlawful.Armenian special forces block a street during an opposition rally in Yerevan on April 19.\"Unfortunately, these public meetings were often held in breach of the law, getting unnecessary and anarchic manifestations as reported in numerous statements issued by the Police,\" his statement continued. \"The developments are fraught with unpredictable consequences, endanger the public order, and can undermine the complex and subtle harmony of Armenian society.\"Sargsyan said he had urged Pashinyan to come to the negotiating table to resolve the situation.Armenian President Armen Sarkissian spoke briefly to Pashinyan surrounded by a crowd of protesters in Republic Square in Yerevan Saturday, Armenpress reported. Sarkissian later met with Sargsyan, it said.CNN's Jennifer Hauser, Carol Jordan and Lauren Kent contributed to this report",

In a speech formally opening the summit at Buckingham Palace in London on Thursday, Queen Elizabeth II said it was her \"sincere wish\" that her son Charles, the Prince of Wales, would head the Commonwealth \"one day.\"Elizabeth has led the Commonwealth since 1952, when she took over the role from her late father, George VI. However the position is not hereditary and it is up to the leaders of the 53 member nations to select a successor.The issue was debated Friday at a Commonwealth leaders' retreat at Windsor Castle, west of London, on the second and final day of the summit. In their leaders' statement, the 53 member countries said: \"We recognize the role of the Queen in championing the Commonwealth and its peoples.Read More\"The next head of the Commonwealth shall be His Royal Highness Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales.\"Jacinda Ardern wears traditional Maori cloak to dinner with Queen ElizabethThe Commonwealth, a voluntary association of advanced and developing nations, brings together some 2.4 billion people around the world. More than half its members are small states, including a number of island nations.The Queen's role as head of the Commonwealth, although largely symbolic, has been a defining element of her reign and it is thought to have been important to her that Charles take over the position, which has no fixed term. An alternative might have been to create a rotating presidency passed between the member countries.The Queen has paid regular visits to Commonwealth nations around the world over the course of her long reign, fostering a network that can be seen as an enduring global legacy in the wake of the demise of the British Empire. The body focuses its efforts on trade, international cooperation, social issues and environmental concerns.Addressing leaders Thursday, Commonwealth Secretary-General Baroness Scotland said the Queen had \"won a place of great affection in the hearts of people in all countries of the Commonwealth.\"UK Prime Minister Theresa May also paid tribute to the Queen's leadership of the body, saying: \"You have been true to the deepest values of the Commonwealth -- that the voice of the smallest member country is worth precisely as much as that of the largest; that the wealthiest and the most vulnerable stand shoulder to shoulder\u200b.\"Welcoming Commonwealth leaders, Charles described the body as \"a fundamental feature of my life for as long as I can remember\" and hailed the \"strong and affectionate bonds\" shared by its members.\"The modern Commonwealth has a vital role to play in building bridges between our countries, fairer societies within them and a more secure world around them,\" he said.Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings are usually held every two years, with member states taking turns as host.

Carlo AncelottiCarlo Ancelotti was sacked by Bayern Munich after a poor start to the season.Another of those with Premier League experience is Carlo Ancelotti.The Italian, one of the most decorated managers in world football, coached Chelsea to a Premier League and FA Cup Double in 2009-10.He most recently coached Bayern Munich but, after winning the Bundesliga in his first season, was sacked by the club following a poor start to the current campaign.Ancelotti is the only manager to have won the Champions League three times, a competition which eluded Wenger in his time at Arsenal.Diego SimeoneDiego Simeone led Atletico Madrid to the La Liga title.Diego Simeone will be in the opposite dugout when Arsenal face Atletico Madrid in the Europa League semifinals.The Argentine, who has enjoyed an incredibly successful seven years in the Spanish capital, is many Arsenal fans' favorite to take over the reigns.After a glittering career as a player, Simeone learned his trade as a manager in Argentina before moving to Atleti in 2011.He led \"Los Colchoneros\" to La Liga glory in 2013-14, breaking Barcelona and Real Madrid's duopoly on the title, the Europa League in 2012 and has twice lost out to Real Madrid in the Champions League final.Antonio ConteAntonio Conte won the Premier League title in his first season in charge at Chelsea.One of the outsiders for the role, Antonio Conte's name has been thrown into the mix as a product of his reportedly strained relationship with current club Chelsea.After winning the Premier League in his first season in charge at the London club, Conte has been openly critical of the lack of investment in his team.Sitting in fifth place, five points behind Tottenham and a Champions League place, the Italian is expected to leave the club at the end of the season.",

With nine teams ready to compete the 2019 season, Howes, who previously played a part in establishing Real Salt Lake in Major League Soccer, says he'd like to see 16 to 20 franchises in the league in the next 10 years.

When the opportunity to play rugby in high school came round, he jumped at it quickly. \"America just needs rugby,\" he says. \"It's a very unique sports culture ... It could be a great outlet for a lot of youth around the country.

My clothes were wet, so my arms were heavy so it just made for a very slow marathon,\" McFadden said.  But she did make it, going on to win the women's wheelchair division in Boston for the fifth time, setting the stage for Sunday's London Marathon where she will be trying to win back-to-back races in the space of less than a week.\"Having them six days apart you have to kind of recover and rest as much as possible and try and get your body back into doing another marathon,\" said McFadden, who is trying to win the two races back-to-back for the fifth time. \"It will be really tough but I like challenges.\"Read MoreTatyana McFadden  crosses the finish line to win the women's push rim wheelchair race in the Boston Marathon in 2016.READ: Schultz hopes radical prosthetics empower othersThat's an understatement for the 28-year-old McFadden, who breaks barriers for a living. She's earned 17 Paralympic medals, including 7 golds, and won 22 major marathons.  She couldn't compete in the London marathon last year because she was recovering from surgery after suffering life-threatening blood clots in her legs. She regained momentum this fall, finishing first in both the New York and Chicago marathons. Winning world class events at will has earned McFadden high-level endorsements from Nike, Coca-Cola, and BP. She's also the face of a new innovation contest, launched by the Toyota Mobility Foundation. The foundation is offering $4 million to inventors who can help people with paralysis live more independently. Entrants already include a group developing an autonomous, eye-controlled wheelchair and a wearable exoskeleton that can aid paralyzed limbs.McFadden has helped raise the profile of the sport, securing more access, media attention, and prize money for disabled athletes. It's a life unimaginable considering where she came from. McFadden competes in the Women's 4x400m T53/54 final at the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games.From Russia to Fierce Disability Rights Advocate Born with a disease called spina bifida, which paralyzed her from the waist down, McFadden still remembers the first six years of her life, spent in a Russian orphanage during the fall of the Soviet Union.Without a wheelchair, she would scoot around on the floor, walking on her hands.  In the orphanage, she found her life motto. \"Ya sama\" is a Russian phrase that roughly translates to \"I can do it myself.\"\"I've always had that attitude,\" McFadden said. \"I wanted to be independent and didn't want anyone to help me. I wanted to figure it out myself.\"Deborah McFadden, a former U.S. Disability Commissioner under George H.W. Bush, and her partner, Bridget O'Shaughnessy, adopted Tatyana and brought her to the US. \"They found the local sports community, they helped me get into my first Paralympic games. Everything I've wanted to do in life, they've always said yes,\" Tatyana said.

Growing up in suburban Baltimore, Tatyana herself became a fierce disability rights advocate, suing the state of Maryland for the right to compete in high school sports. \"Here is somebody who is a champion, but it's more that she's a winner at the game of life,\" said Deborah McFadden, Tatyana's mother and manger -- nicknamed \"Mom-ager\" for short. \"She's a role model for so many.\"McFadden said she wants to be recognized as an elite athlete and not for overcoming a disability.

After thousands of hours of restoring and modernizing one of Ferrari's luxury sports car, Californian Eric Hutchison accomplished the unthinkable and created the very first -- and, as it turns out, fastest -- electric 1978 Ferrari 308 GTS.California-based company Electric GT turn 1978 Ferrari 308 into an electric car. \"I really was dying to know how this 308 compared to a stock 308,\" Hutchison, of electric car conversion specialist Electric GT, tells CNN Supercharged.\"We had a professional driver drive both cars in a timed environment on the same track -- about a mile and a half -- and the professional driver did that lap in 1:26 with a gas Ferrari.\"Next up was Hutchison's electric creation.Read More\"The electric car absolutely decimated the gas car,\" he says.\"Watching the professional driver off the line, the electric car left like a 25-foot burn out as he was just gripping for traction.\"The so-called 308 GTE finished the same track 10 seconds faster. The \"308 GTE\" was 10 seconds faster than the classic gas sports car.The opportunity for speed is what makes the car a perfect vehicle to transform, according to Hutchison.\"The Ferrari makes a great candidate for conversion because when you're converting the car to electric you're adding power, you're doubling the power, you're doubling the torque,\" he says.\"This car was meant for speed. It might not have been engineered for this much speed, but it handles it really well. This car actually goes so much better and it feels natural with this amount of power in it.\"'It was a mess'Hutchison found the 1978 Ferrari totally destroyed after a catastrophic engine fire -- the motor and all of its electronics were irreparable. But $10,000 later, he was the owner of a Ferrari 308 shell.Hutchison says he was horrified when he brought the Ferrari 308 home from the junk yard.\"When I brought the project home from the junk yard, I was completely horrified,\" he says.\"It had been burned up in a fuel fire, gasoline leaked on the motor. It smelled, all the rubber was melted, there was broken glass. It was frankly a mess.\"It was a labor of love. Hutchison quit four times in the two years that it took to restore the vintage car, but finally after thousands of hours of stripping the car, restoring its frame and recycling the parts the team no longer needed, it was finally complete -- though not without controversy.JUST WATCHEDFirst electric Ferrari: Faster than originalReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFirst electric Ferrari: Faster than original 03:25In 2016, Ferrari boss Sergio Marchionne said an electric Ferrari would be \"obscene.\" What's the point of a silent Ferrari when the aggressive sound of its engine is a crucial part of the driving experience, he argued.And while Marchionne has since changed his stance, admitting that the luxury automaker will move towards electrification by 2020, Hutchinson couldn't wait that long.\"Converting what is historically a gas car with a big roar to all electric is extremely polarizing in public,\" Hutchison says.\"I have been shamed, told, 'what the heck have you been doing?,' or 'why did you do that project?' \"There's always going to be the purists, and then there's going to be the new wave of electric performance, and the one car that polarizes it more than anything is nothing but a Ferrari.\"'Phenomenal' driving experienceThe roar of Hutchison's car, which has three batteries -- one in the front and two in an L-shaped configuration where the gas tanks used to sit -- has been replaced by a quieter electric hum.\"There's something very calming about sitting in a car when it's not making any engine noise,\" he explains. \"You put your foot down on the pedal in this car, it elicits fear, it's scary, it launches, it explodes and that there's no noise and then you put your foot down and you hear your tires ripping.The adrenaline of getting in an electric car with this much power on a Ferrari frame is phenomenal. Indescribable.Eric Hutchison, electric Ferrari creator\"The adrenaline of getting in an electric car with this much power on a Ferrari frame is phenomenal. Indescribable.\"But is it comparable to an original Ferrari?\"Not by any means,\" Hutchison admits. \"It's a whole different experience.\"The association with noise and shifting is an automotive experience ... the symphony changes tremendously and the car -- the feeling, the motors -- sound much more like a jet engine when they fire up.\"So there are other noises that come with the change and if you compare it to what a Ferrari has sounded like forever, of course, it's not a Ferrari engine.\" Photos: Ferrari Under the SkinFerrari 125-S, 1947  \u2013 The first ever Ferrari was fired up and left the Maranello factory gates 70 years ago.

However, the position is not hereditary, and it is up to the leaders of the 53 member countries to select each successor.Welcoming leaders to Buckingham Palace as she formally opened the 2018 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, the monarch said it remained \"a great pleasure and honor to serve\" the Commonwealth, adding that she is proud of the \"flourishing network\" it has become.\"It is my sincere wish that the Commonwealth will continue to offer stability and continuity for future generations and will decide that one day the Prince of Wales should carry on the important work started by my father in 1949,\" she said, using another title for Prince Charles.\"By continuing to treasure and reinvigorate our associations and activities, I believe we will secure a safer, more prosperous and sustainable world for those who follow us, a world where the Commonwealth's generosity of spirit can bring its gentle touch of healing and hope to all.\"Read MorePrince Charles welcomes Commonwealth leaders Thursday to the London summit.In his own remarks welcoming the Commonwealth leaders, Prince Charles described the body as \"a fundamental feature of my life for as long as I can remember\" and hailed the \"strong and affectionate bonds\" shared by its members.\"The modern Commonwealth has a vital role to play in building bridges between our countries, fairer societies within them and a more secure world around them,\" he said.Trade, ocean governance and cybersecurity are among the topics the leaders will address during the summit. Forums have also been held for women, young people, business and civil society.UK Prime Minister Theresa May said the Commonwealth represents \"an incredible opportunity\" to show what could be done through coordinated action to answer some of the 21st Century's biggest questions.She also paid tribute to the Queen's leadership of the body, saying: \"You have been true to the deepest values of the Commonwealth -- that the voice of the smallest member country is worth precisely as much as that of the largest; that the wealthiest and the most vulnerable stand shoulder to shoulder\u200b.\"Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings are usually held every two years, with member states taking turns as host. Since the Queen no longer undertakes foreign trips, this is likely to be the last time she attends the summit in person.The Commonwealth, a voluntary association of advanced and developing nations, brings together some 2.4 billion people around the world.CNN's Katie Polglase contributed to this report.",

Industry will be given sufficient time to adapt, and the government will propose excluding plastic straws used for medical reasons.JUST WATCHEDSaving the earth, one 6 pack at a timeReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSaving the earth, one 6 pack at a time 02:52\"Single-use plastics are a scourge on our seas and lethal to our precious environment and wildlife so it is vital we act now,\" Gove said.Many businesses in Britain have already taken steps to cut their use of plastic straws amid growing public concern about the impact of plastic waste on ocean life.According to the UK government, 1 million birds and more than 100,000 sea mammals die every year from eating and getting tangled in plastic waste.A UK government report released last month warned that the amount of plastic in oceans will triple between 2015 and 2025 if action isn't taken.Jonathan Bartley, co-leader of Britain's Green Party, said the government consultation on plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds was \"another step forward but progress is painfully slow.\"The proposals must become action, he said via Twitter, and the government should bring forward its \"utterly unambitious\" target of eliminating all avoidable plastic waste by 2042.Volunteers collect plastic waste washed up on a beach in Plymouth, southwest England, in August. Louise Edge, senior oceans campaigner at environmental campaign group Greenpeace UK, said the UK government had made a \"strong move\" on banning some of the most unnecessary single-use plastics but that it was important to go further.\"Other non-recyclable 'problem plastic' should also be banned at the earliest opportunity,\" she said. \"Greenpeace is encouraging retailers to take responsibility for their products, eliminate problem plastics immediately and to phase out single-use plastic in their own-brand products.\"Last month, the UK government announced it intends to introduce a deposit on plastic bottles, requiring customers to pay an extra levy when buying single-use drink containers that will be refunded once those items are recycled. Similar programs are in effect in a number of countries, including Germany and Norway and in parts of the United States.A report published this month that showed a significant drop in the number of plastic bags littering Britain's seabeds suggests that efforts to reduce their use by imposing a charge are working.",

I've given myself the chance, it didn't quite work out but the more I keep putting myself in those positions, sooner or later it is going to happen for me.\"Read MoreJUST WATCHEDMasters champ Patrick Reed on his 2018 winReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMasters champ Patrick Reed on his 2018 win 04:26READ: \"I am who I am,\" Patrick Reed tells CNNA four-time major winner, McIlroy's best finish at the Masters was fourth back in 2015.The closest he's come to a win at Augusta, however, was in 2011 when he held a four-shot lead heading into the final round before a now-infamous collapse saw him finished tied for 15th place.This year, McIlroy once again failed to produce his best golf on a Masters Sunday, meaning the 28-year-old was unable to mount a serious challenge to Reed.\"I wasn't disappointed that I didn't win,\" McIlroy explained. \"I was just disappointed that again, I didn't put any pressure on the leader.

The latest leg of the world's premiere show jumping circuit starts Thursday. (CNN)The third leg of the Longines Global Champions Tour and Global Champions League sees the riders and horses travel to Shanghai for the most eastern event of the season. Two specially-chartered planes fly in some of the very best jumping horses on the planet to compete at what is a pioneering event on China's mainland. Historic hurdles Strict quarantines rules previously made it impossible to fly international competition horses in and out of China.But, thanks to a landmark arrangement, the Global Champions Tour broke new ground in 2014 with the hosting of its inaugural event at the China Art Palace.Read MoreIt took years of collaboration between the Chinese Government and European Commission to come to an agreement on quarantine rules allowing European horses into the country.The cooperation between the two authorities led to the creation of a special quarantine zone at the competition venue in Shanghai.JUST WATCHEDLGCT & GCL Miami: Edwina Tops-Alexander shinesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLGCT & GCL Miami: Edwina Tops-Alexander shines 03:32READ: Edwina Tops-Alexander returns from maternity to win in MiamiThe international horses' stables, exercise arenas and competition zone are all within this specially-monitored area so that contact with the local horse population is prevented. Jan Tops, the founder of the Global Champions Tour, worked hard to make the event a possibility. \"We were basically the pioneers in bringing the international horses here for the first time,\" he explained to CNN last year. \"It took many years to plan and to get the correct permission to overcome the quarantine rules on mainland China. \"It was not even possible for the equestrian events as part of the Beijing Olympics to be held here which is why they had to go to Hong Kong.\"READ: Get ready for the biggest year yetEnthusiastic crowdsLess than one week after Formula One hit town for the Chinese Grand Prix, sports fan will once again gather to watch elite international competitors.And the Shanghai grandstands make for a unique atmosphere.While events held in Europe and America take place in front of crowds who are well versed in equestrian sport, spectators in Shanghai are often seeing show jumping for the first time.As a result, the riders are cheered and applauded whether they jump clear or knock down poles. Jump-offs against the clock are noisy affairs with gasps coming from the crowd as horses clear fences which can be up to 160 centimeters high. There might be spontaneous applause during a round which, like cheering a golfer on a green or a tennis player mid-point, is usually not encouraged.But in Shanghai the crowds enthusiasm is appreciated and enjoyed by the riders. \"Our event in Shanghai goes from strength to strength each year and it is fantastic to see the passion of the audience,\" adds Tops. \"It is great to see fans queuing before the gates open for the competitions and the Exhibition Shopping Village is always packed. \"I know the riders love to come to this event and feel the warmth of the people and their admiration for these top horses.\" Spectators dress to impress in Shanghai.Rise of Equestrian Sport in China Equestrian sport is seen as an aspirational pastime for many Chinese, so the event is not just one for fans of the sport. It's also a big social occasion, with visitors' outfits similar to those seen during day at a horse racing meeting. Think big hats and smart attire. Associated with a luxury lifestyle, China's burgeoning middle class has contributed to the growth in horse ownership and the participation in equestrian.\"The rise in interest in equestrianism has been considerable,\" says Tops, and figures back this up. According to the latest China-Europe equestrian seminar, in 2014 there were around 200 equestrian or riding clubs in China.Now the figure is over 1,500, and rising, with club membership totally nearly one million. \"We are proud to be here and look forward to building a strong future for our sport in China,\" says Tops.A view of the arena at the Shanghai Arts Palace.Return of the champion Harrie Smolders Having missed the two opening events in Mexico City and Miami, the 2017 Longines Global Champions Tour overall champion, Harrie Smolders (NED), will make his first appearance of the season in Shanghai with his top stallion Don VHP Z.Smolders, a winner of the Shanghai Grand Prix in 2015, will be looking for a bright start to his 2018 challenge.

        "content": "(CNN)The UK Home Office destroyed landing card slips that documented arrival dates for the so-called Windrush generation, it confirmed Wednesday, an admission that has added to pressure on the government over its treatment of some Caribbean migrants.The landing card slips were \"securely disposed\" of in 2010, the Home Office said. UK Prime Minister Theresa May was Home Secretary at the time in the Conservative government of former premier David Cameron. The confirmation came a day after May publicly apologized for any \"anxiety\" caused to the Windrush generation -- the first large group of Caribbean migrants to arrive in the UK after World War II. Her words followed widespread condemnation of the government's treatment of the Windrush generation, some of whom are facing deportation after decades living in Britain because they don't have the right paperwork.People being deported to Jamaica from UK told to 'try to be Jamaican' In a statement Wednesday, the Home Office said that \"in 2010, the decision was taken by the UK Border Agency to securely dispose of some documents known as registration slips.\" This decision was made in line with the Data Protection Act 1998, under which the Home Office has a \"legal obligation to ensure that the personal data it holds is not kept for longer than is necessary.\"Read MoreHowever, speaking during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons, May stated that the decision to destroy the documents had been made in 2009, when a Labour government was in power.The Home Office also argued that the landing card slips did not provide proof of residence.\"Registration slips provided details of an individual's date of entry, they did not provide any reliable evidence relating to ongoing residence in the UK or their immigration status,\" a Home Office spokesperson said.\"So it would be misleading and inaccurate to suggest that registration slips would therefore have a bearing on immigration cases whereby Commonwealth citizens are proving residency in the UK.\"The Guardian reported Tuesday that the documents were destroyed when a Home Office branch was closed down in 2010. May: 'These people are British'Addressing lawmakers Wednesday, May sought to draw a line under the controversy over her government's treatment of migrants from the Windrush generation.\"People in the Windrush generation who came here from Commonwealth countries have built a life here, they've made an enormous contribution. These people are British. They are part of us,\" she said.\"I want to be absolutely clear: We have no intention of asking anyone to leave who has the right to remain here. For those who have mistakenly received letters challenging them -- I want to apologize to them and I want to say sorry to anyone who has been caused confusion or anxiety felt as a result of this.\" Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn slammed what he called a \"shameful episode\" and said responsibility for the situation \"lies firmly at the Prime Minister's door\" because of her actions while Home Secretary.Earlier, Shadow Home Secretary Dianne Abbott, a Labour member of Parliament, told BBC Radio 4 that current Home Secretary Amber Rudd should \"consider her position\" over her department's handling of the issue.\"There are so many things that have gone wrong. This is not a new situation, it's been going on for some years,\" said Abbott, as she called for the Home Office to make public the information it holds on the number of people who have been detained or deported. \"This has caused so much misery and has ruined so many people's lives,\" she said.May: 'Genuinely sorry'May apologized at a meeting with Caribbean leaders and insisted the Windrush generation was still welcome in the country. May said her government was \"genuinely sorry for any anxiety that has been caused\" and that Home Office personnel were \"dealing with this as well and efficiently and swiftly as they can and giving people every support that we can give them.\"Theresa May hosts a meeting Tuesday with leaders and representatives of Caribbean countries at 10 Downing Street.May acknowledged that the crisis had arisen because of tough new rules imposed during her time as Home Secretary in an effort to crack down on illegal immigration.The measures, introduced in 2012, require employers, landlords and health service providers to demand evidence of legal immigration status. At the time, May said they were designed to create a \"hostile environment\" for people living in the UK illegally.But some of the Windrush children, who were invited along with their parents to Britain in the late 1940s to help rebuild the country after the devastation of World War Two, don't have the required documentation and are now struggling to prove their right to stay.As a consequence, some lost their jobs, others were evicted from their homes and a few were reported to have been threatened with deportation.On Tuesday, the Home Office told CNN it was looking into 49 cases relating to the Windrush generation after a new hotline was established to help those affected obtain the correct paperwork.Until an immigration law that came into force in 1973, Commonwealth citizens and their children had the automatic right to live and work in the UK. Many did so, without any need for additional documentation.CNN's James Masters and Carol Jordan contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)The death of a Russian investigative reporter has raised alarms about a worrying pattern: Tragic and often deadly incidents involving people who go public on sensitive issues. On Sunday, investigative journalist Maxim Borodin died after a fall from a fifth-floor balcony of his apartment in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg. Russian investigators said they didn't see any grounds to launch a criminal probe, but Borodin's colleagues doubt the official account of his death -- and several human rights organizations urged authorities to initiate a thorough investigation.\"Russia has a record of brushing aside suspicious deaths of members of the press,\" said Nina Ognianova, a program coordinator with the Committee to Protect Journalists. \"We urge authorities on both the regional and federal level to consider that Borodin may have been attacked and that his investigative journalism was the motive.\"Borodin's death drew immediate attention, not least because he had been investigating the activities of Wagner, a shadowy private military firm that has deployed mercenaries in Syria and Ukraine. The advocacy group Reporters Without Borders noted the \"highly sensitive nature\" of the journalist's work, which probed some of the most taboo subjects in Russian media.Read More\"All hypotheses must be given serious consideration, including the possibility that he was murdered in connection with his reporting,\" the organization said.Russian investigative reporter dies after fall, and some fear foul playNews of Borodin's demise came just one day before new revelations about another mysterious death: That of Russian entrepreneur Valery Pshenichny.The report said Pshenichny, who was accused of embezzling $1.6 million in a state military contract, had been raped, electrocuted and killed in pretrial detention, the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta reported, citing an examination by state forensic pathologists. Pshenichny had developed a unique 3D-modeling system for submarine construction and was under contract with the Russian Ministry of Defense. In 2016, Pshenichny accused his business partner of embezzlement, a charge that led to his arrest. The business partner subsequently testified that Pshenichny and another associate conspired to inflate the cost of the contract and was released. Pshenichny was found hanging in his cell three weeks after his arrest on January 18.Russia's Investigative Committee of Russia, the country's top investigative body, ruled the death a suicide. The new forensics investigation cast doubt on this version, saying there were signs of torture, Novaya Gazeta reported.\"Electric shock marks from a hot-water boiler cord were found in his mouth. Lacerations and stab wounds on his body. A broken spine. Simply put, he was tortured,\" Novaya Gazeta wrote Monday.Following the reports, federal authorities launched an internal investigation of Pshenichny's death, state-run RIA Novosti reported Tuesday. The death of Borodin mirrored a case that happened a little over 10 years ago in Moscow.Ivan Safronov, a military correspondent for the Kommersant newspaper, fell out of a window of his fifth-story apartment and died. Investigative authorities ruled it was a suicide; Safronov's friends and colleagues denied he had any motive to take his own life -- his daughter was about to give birth and his son was just about to start his undergraduate studies.  Safronov had looked into corruption and hazing in the Russian army, as well as Russian weapons exports, sometimes prompting legal action by the state.Two weeks prior his death, Safronov went to an arms expo in the United Arab Emirates to investigate supplies of Su-39 jet fighters to Syria and S-300 surface-to-air-missiles to Iran. Upon return, reporter told his editors that he was able confirm that Russia signed a deal with Syria to supply Pantsir-S1 anti-aircraft missiles, MiG-29 fighters and Iskander-E ballistic missiles.Safronov never wrote the article, the newspaper said. His colleagues recall the journalist telling he was warned: if this unleashes a big international scandal, the FSB will certainly initiate a criminal investigation into the dissemination of state secrets and \"will take it to the end,\" Kommersant wrote at the time.And investigative reporters are not the only ones who are the victims of mysterious falls.Last year, lawyer Nikolai Gorokhov fell from the fourth floor balcony of his Moscow apartment block and sustained serious head injuries. He is a lawyer for the family of Russian attorney Sergei Magnitsky, who died in a Russian prison in 2009. Magnitsky's death led the the passage of the Magnitsky Act in 2012 by US lawmakers, to punish the Russians they saw as responsible for his death.",

        "content": "London (CNN)The UK Government has lost a key Brexit vote, with the upper House of Parliament backing calls to remain in the EU customs union after Brexit.The House of Lords voted 348 to 225 to amend the government's EU Withdrawal Bill, which will now return to the House of Commons where the defeat is likely to spur renewed opposition.The amendment requires the government to report to Parliament by October 31 on what steps it has taken to remain in the customs union, which allows goods to flow freely across the European Union.The government opposed the amendment. Prime Minister May had previously said Britain will not remain in the customs union after Brexit takes effect.The House of Lords is now considering other amendments to the proposed legislation. Read MoreWhat is the customs union?The customs union enables the 28 EU member states, and other countries such as Turkey that have signed up to its rules, to function as a single trading area.In practice, it means that cars made in France can be sent to Italy without facing tariffs or a customs check at the border. Goods made outside the union are allowed to circulate freely once they've gained initial entry.Related: Why does the custom union matter?However, membership prevents a country from negotiating its own bilateral trade deals with other nations.The ability to agree new trade deals -- with the United States or China, for example -- is central to Prime Minister Theresa May's vision for Britain after Brexit. In a speech in September, she ruled out staying in the customs union.ReactionsThe government said it regretted the defeat. \"The fundamental purpose of this bill is to prepare our statute book for exit day, it is not about the terms of our exit,\" a spokeswoman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said in a statement.Former British PM David Cameron says he doesn't regret the Brexit referendum\"This amendment does not commit the UK to remaining in a customs union with the EU, it requires us to make a statement in parliament explaining the steps we've taken.\"Our policy on this subject is very clear. We are leaving the customs union and will establish a new and ambitious customs arrangement with the EU while forging new trade relationships with our partners around the world.\"However, Andrew Adonis, who sits in the House of Lords on the opposition Labout benches, said: \"At long last, a voice of common sense on Brexit has made itself heard in parliament. It is simply impossible to do Brexit without a customs union so the House of Lords has spoken up for good and responsible government.\"However, even with a customs union Britain will still be worse off if we leave. That is why we need a people's vote on the final deal.\"",

Many of the new powers were not expected to take effect until after the polls, which were scheduled to take place in November 2019. Now, the winner of June's presidential vote -- widely expected to be Erdogan -- will be able to use them far quicker than had previously been planned. \"Even though it seems as if there are no serious issues because the administration and the presidency work compatibly, the diseases of the old system pop up at every step,\" Erdogan said Wednesday. \"The ability to make strong decisions and implement them for the future of our country has become more urgent.\"The Russia-Turkey-Iran solution for Syria leaves key issues unresolved\"It is imperative to eliminate the idea of elections quickly while there are very important decisions on issues such as the fast paced developments in Syria as well as macroeconomic issues and large investments,\" Erdogan added.Read MoreThe 64-year-old served as prime minister from 2003 until he was elected president in 2014. In April of last year, 51% of Turks voted in favor of the referendum that abolished the parliamentary system and could allow Erdogan to stay in power for another decade.Under the new system, the president will be able to prepare the budget and appoint high-level officials, including ministers and judges. In addition, the president will be able to declare a state of emergency, a power currently held by the government. The president could also in some circumstances dissolve parliament.Why call a snap election now?Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) had previously been wary of calling early elections, but a highly fluctuating economy combined with the president's desire to switch to Turkey's new governmental system led to a rethink.

Since then, Erdogan has cracked down on dissent, and thousands of people -- including political opponents, civil servants, journalists and police -- have been jailed. Turkey is also conducting a military operation targeting Kurdish groups in northwest Syria to clear the border area of militias it considers to be terrorist organizations.The AKP would like to keep the state of emergency in place throughout the election cycle, though the detrimental effect it has had on the economy means the party would not want to sustain it beyond the vote.The ruling AKP is expected to campaign in an alliance with the minority Nationalist Movement Party, whose leader had lobbied for early elections. The main opposition CHP party, the Republican People's Party, is expected to run alone but has not named a presidential candidate as of yet.CNN's Gul Tuyusz reported from Istanbul.

        "content": "(CNN)Former British Prime Minister David Cameron says he doesn't regret calling a referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union -- but wishes the result had gone the other way.\"I made a promise to the British people -- I kept that promise,\" he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in his first major broadcast interview since resigning in 2016, to mark the release of a report on development in fragile states by a committee he co-chairs.Cameron's fateful decision to call the referendum led to his political downfall and left his successor, Theresa May, with a diplomatic tangle that has plagued her shaky government. Brexit negotiations have been fraught, and key sticking points remain outstanding less than a year before Britain is due formally to leave the EU.Cameron, who campaigned to stay in the EU, continues to believe the outcome of the vote was a mistake. \"I think we've taken the wrong course,\" he said.Cameron resigned the day after the Brexit referendum, June 24, 2016.But the former prime minister said that, after more than two decades of EU membership during which the bloc had acquired greater powers in successive treaties, a referendum was the right thing to do. \"I don't think you can belong to these organizations and see their powers grow and treaty after treaty and power after power going from Westminster to Brussels and never asking the people whether they're happy governed in that way.\"Read MoreRelated: UK government loses key Brexit voteOn Syria air strikes: 'May was right'Like his successor, Cameron faced a decision on whether to retaliate against the use of chemical weapons in Syria. He asked the UK Parliament to back his plans for air strikes in 2013, but lost the vote and was forced to withdraw a plan to allow UK fighter jets to bomb targets in Syria. This time, May did not seek prior parliamentary approval to join the US in striking at the Syrian regime.Cameron told Amanpour that he supported the air strikes, launched by British, American and French forces last weekend. May \"has done the right thing,\" he said.\"This is not about regime change in Syria, although God knows we need it. It's not about intervening in the civil war. It is about making a point that the use of chemical weapons is unacceptable.\"The US assessed that sarin and chlorine were used in an attack on a rebel enclave in the Damascus suburb of Douma earlier this month. Cameron said that the world could not allow the use of chemical weapons \"to become normalized.\"Cameron told Amanpour that he wished the House of Commons had supported him five years ago. \"I deeply regret that Parliament didn't vote for similar action in 2013,\" he said. \"I think I know why -- a lot of people were so unhappy about what had happened in Iraq, and they were so bruised by that.\"On his legacy: 'People will make up their own minds' Until now, Cameron has said little in public about the Brexit vote, which fulfilled a pledge he made to voters ahead of the UK election in 2015. He was caught on a hot microphone in January at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, telling a steel magnate that Brexit was \"a mistake not a disaster,\" and that it had \"turned out less badly than we first thought.\"'Just get on with it': Brexit voters want out -- for better or worseCameron unexpectedly resigned a day after the vote, when Britons voted by 52% to 48% to leave the EU.Peter Mandelson, a former British trade minister, told the Financial Times recently that history would remember Cameron for nothing more than taking the UK out of the EU: \"A man who took this tactical risk, which then turned into a strategic blunder,\" he said.When Amanpour put that quote to Cameron, he was diplomatic. \"I think people will make up their own minds,\" he said. \"I obviously believe that I was right to hold a referendum.\"He touted the economic growth, job creation and boosted budget for development aid over which he presided.\"People say this is all about politics. And of course there's always politics involved in these decisions.\" But the British people, he said, saw \"with the development of the single currency the beginning of decisions being made about us without us, and we needed to fix our position.\"\"I wanted to fix it inside the European Union. The British public chose that we would fix it from outside the European Union.\"\"And I wish my successor well with her work in being what I hope will be a good and friendly and close neighbor to the European Union rather than as we were -- perhaps we were a slightly unhappy tenant.\"On 'fragile states'Since leaving office, Cameron has focused his concerns on governance abroad.A key proposal from the Commission on State Fragility, Growth and Development, which is backed by the London School of Economics and the University of Oxford, is to simplify the goals that Western countries and international organizations often set for fragile sates.\"We need to strip that back and say actually the most important things are basic security, and basic economics,\" he told Amanpour.That means being realistic about the pace of democratic reform.\"If you go straight to the election, you may find you get one person, one vote -- but it might be one person, one vote, once -- and one of the parties to the conflict wins the election, and then really overrides the system and you don't get the genuine democracy.\"For a country like Iraq, where power is divided between a large swath of groups, including Sunni and Shiite Muslims, he advocated a period under a provisional government during which norms of power sharing would be established, before multiparty elections are held.\"We've got to be realistic,\" he said. \"Sometimes we look at a country like Somalia... and the international community almost says, 'Right, we've got this great plan to turn you into Denmark, this model of democracy, in a very short period of time.' It's totally unrealistic.\"Fragile countries become \"unfragile\" only when \"the people in those countries look to those governments and institutions and say, 'Yes, they're mine.'\"",

Have your say on CNN Sport's Facebook pageHide Caption 11 of 11'Strange thing'The idea began in 2009 when the visionary director of Turin's Lorusso e Cutugno prison, Pietro Buffa, fell in love with rugby after a visit to New Zealand. Having already introduced boxing, football and basketball to his prison, he wanted to see if rugby's values could take root among the inmates. Having never played, he called upon the region's favorite rugby son Walter Rista, the Piedmont region's most-capped player, who appeared on the wing for Italy five times in the 1970s.  A trial match was organized in February 2010 to gauge interest, and training sessions began soon after.The La Drola project was born.\"The dream was to set up the first penitentiary rugby team: The La Drola Rugby Sports Association -- in the Piedmont dialect, drola means 'strange thing' or 'silly thing',\" says Rista.   The first official match between a team of inmates and an outside XV took place in October 2011. Reports were reaching the bosses that this was having a positive effect on inmates' physical and mental well-being. Rista noted the growing level of cohesion between teammates, a sense of shared and individual responsibility.\"The good results of the first year test were very encouraging, but after the success of the Drola Project, there were hundreds of spontaneous inmates requests to be included in the team -- from Turin as well as from other penitentiaries around Italy,\" adds Rista.READ: Uganda rugby star Solomon Okia revels in World Cup dreamJUST WATCHEDAustralia vs. New Zealand: Rugby's big rivalryReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAustralia vs. New Zealand: Rugby's big rivalry 22:53Strict protocolsHowever, the first years of the project were difficult. Dealing with a group of individuals with different ethnicities and languages is hard enough in a prison, before you add in the nature of sport and the restrictions on space and facilities. Some inmates had low levels of athletic aptitude, and there are obvious dietary limitations and strict protocols within any compound. Plus, many did not know the first thing about rugby. But the project gathered pace when the FIR agreed to allow the team to participate in the domestic Serie C league against external teams. \"This allows a virtuous experience for those inside the walls and for the outsiders who must come in to play,\" adds Cantoni.\"Participation in the Championship by La Drola and Giallo Dozza (a prison in Bologna) and until last year of the Bisonti (a maximum security prison in Frosinone) was realized thanks to the opposition who agreed to play all matches against these teams inside their institutions.

He would also like the institutions to take responsibility for funding medical expenses, better nutrition and for playing and training materials. And he urges amateur clubs on the outside to play a greater part in helping reintegrate offenders into society. For Rista, the benefits of the project are distinct and clear. \"Every year some inmates are reinserted into society, and many of them are required to play or teach rugby on the outside,\" he says. \"Rugby's values are perfectly fitting with inmates' needs for rehabilitation. \"For example, one year there were two inmates who asked to postpone their release just so they could be part of the team when they finished competing in that year's league championship.\"The Drola team is now very well known inside and outside of Piedmont, and some other similar project have been launched in other Italian Regions. \"In autumn 2016 there was the first match between two penitentiary rugby teams, in Bologna.

Known as the Windrush generation -- the first of their numbers came on the Empire Windrush passenger liner in June 1948 -- they were the first large group of Caribbean migrants to arrive in the UK. They came to symbolize the seismic demographic changes that took place in post-war Britain, when hundreds of thousands of people came to the United Kingdom from former British colonies, known as the Commonwealth. But in recent years, successive British governments have sought to appear tough on illegal immigration, and their descendants are now struggling to prove a citizenship status they previously took for granted. In essence, the children of the Windrush generation are being told they might not be British after all.London state school in the early 1980s. Yet the Windrush generation are not illegal immigrants. Until a new immigration law came into force in 1973, Commonwealth citizens and their children had the automatic right to live and work in the UK. Many did so, without any need for additional documentation. In recent years, however, changes to UK immigration law have caused significant problems for many of them.Read More'Hostile environment'Regulations introduced by Prime Minister Theresa May, when she was Home Secretary in the previous Conservative government led by David Cameron, require employers, landlords and health service providers to demand evidence of legal immigration status. In 2012, May described the measures as designed to create a \"hostile environment\" for people who were in the UK illegally.The trouble is, many of the Windrush children don't have the required documentation. As a consequence, some lost their jobs, others were evicted from their homes, and a few were reported to have been threatened with deportation.The bubbling controversy exploded into a full-blown scandal at the weekend. For the first time in 20 years, the UK is hosting the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, a biennial summit of leaders of Commonwealth nations. A delegation of Commonwealth leaders requested a meeting with the Prime Minister to discuss the Windrush issue, which Downing Street -- to widespread consternation -- declined. Stung by a wave of negative publicity, the government backed down and said a meeting would take place. Forced to appear before MPs in the House of Commons, Home Secretary Amber Rudd apologized for the \"appalling\" treatment of some of the Windrush migrants and promised that none of them would be deported for lack of documentation.Home Secretary Amber Rudd apologized in Parliament.But many have gone through months of agony. Glenda Caesar was just six months old in 1961 when she traveled from Dominica to the UK with her parents.  After working for 16 years as an administrator with the National Health Service, she suddenly lost her job as she could not provide the necessary documentation. \"I worked as an administrator for the NHS and was told I have to leave as I did not have UK status,\" she told CNN.  \"I am not working at present and still need documentation on my father and school or medical records as the final part.\"Labour MP David Lammy said in a tweet Monday that what was happening was \"grotesque, immoral and inhumane,\" and has rallied around 140 fellow MPs from all parties to call on the Prime Minister to immediately address the issue in parliament. Thread: Today I have led 140 MPs from 6 parties urging @theresa_may to take immediate action to address the #Windrush crisis. What is going on is grotesque, immoral and inhumane.

Patrick Vernon, an expert on Caribbean family history in the UK, organized a petition that received more than the 100,000 signatures required for a debate on the issue to be held in parliament. \"It's like telling the descendants of fourth generation Irish immigrants to the US that suddenly you might not be American after all and could be deported,\" Vernon told CNN.Vernon said he knew of people desperately trying to find photos of themselves in school playgrounds to prove how long they had been in the UK. Conservative MP and Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, Sajid Javid, said he was \"deeply concerned\" to hear about the difficulties some from the Windrush generation are facing, in a tweet on Monday. \"This should not happen to people who have been longstanding pillars of our community,\" Javid said, adding that the government is looking into this matter \"urgently.\" Satbir Singh, Chief Executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants told CNN, called on the government to ease the process for members of the Windrush generation who sought to regularize their immigration status.  \"The government needs to make a clear guarantee that people seeking clarification of their status should have their rights guaranteed while they are doing so,\" he said.Singh said many of the people caught out are low-income earners who have not required a passport. And although it has been people from the Caribbean who have entered the media spotlight, there are also other people from former colonies in South Asia and Africa who might be affected, By switching the onus on checking documents to the private sector, such as landlords and healthcare providers, he said the system has become \"blatantly racist.\"\"I'm second generation Indian and no matter how British my English is, I will always look like an immigrant,\" he said.",

The horse, who rose from humble beginnings in New Zealand during the Great Depression to become an international racing sensation, is one of Australia's most popular horses. \"It is tricky...to compare them with the great sports people but with a thoroughbred it also relies on their mental strength and the ability to perform on the big stage,\" McAvaney told the Australian Daily Telegraph.\"Winx has shown that time and time again.

Follow @cnnsport\n\nIt's a fantastic achievement for City manager Guardiola, who ended his first year in England without silverware -- his only failure to win a trophy since his managerial career started back in 2007. Fast-forward 12 months and Guardiola's City side has achieved a domestic double, adding the Premier League to the League Cup they won in February. City has looked in a class of its own during the season and has only lost two league games -- to Liverpool and Manchester United -- and Guardiola's men have been scoring nearly three goals a game.Read MoreThey are on course to break a whole host of records including the most points, most wins, most goals scored and biggest winning margin in a season.Guardiola and his staff celebrate after winning the Carabao Cup Final against Arsenal.Spatial awareness\"It just seems like all the players, whether they're fighting for each other, whether they're fighting for the manager, or they're fighting for the club, the results are coming,\" says Mike Fairclough, a City season ticket holder since 1999.\"Obviously it's very easy to enjoy football when you're winning but it just seems like there's a lot more team spirit and identity about the place and that's because of the manager in my opinion.\"Guardiola's football philosophy centers on the idea of \"juego de posicion\" or positional play.It's a philosophy that served Guardiola well during his spells at Bayern Munich and Barcelona -- he won a remarkable 21 trophies in eight seasons -- and splits the pitch into 20 zones, five vertical spaces and four horizontal spaces. No more than three players are allowed in any horizontal space and no more than two in any vertical space, meaning players must constantly be aware of where they are on the pitch. The system is designed to constantly provide space for the man on the ball, or for a player in space to receive a pass. Key for Guardiola is the \"half-space\" -- the areas between the opposition's central defenders and full-backs.\"Ninety percent of Manchester City's goals come from this area,\" Brighton midfielder Steve Sidwell recently told the Training Ground Guru website after attending a two-day session with the Football Association of Wales as part of his UEFA A License course.\"When they build up play on the left, [the full-back] comes into central midfield and (Leroy) Sane stays way out wide and pins the full-back there.\"It causes dilemmas, it causes an overload in midfield.\"Brazilian goalkeeper Ederson has been a revelation for City this season. Squad surgeryThe numbers City has posted this season haven't come by accident. Guardiola learned from his first season in English soccer, convinced he didn't have the players to implement his tactical ideas.Benfica goalkeeper Ederson Moraes was bought for $50 million. As well as being exceptional with his feet, the Brazilian is equally adept at keeping the ball out of the net. City have kept 15 clean sheets.\"With Ederson in goal ... he kind of takes the ball under pressure and move it around the back four and what that's done is that it's just enabled City to play a lot more than they were doing last season,\" Dave Mooney, host of Blue Moon, a Manchester City fan podcast, told CNN Sport.Kyle Walker has been in brilliant form this season, a flying winger one minute, the last line of defense the next.Guardiola also shipped out aging defenders, Aleksandar Kolorov, Gael Clichy, Bacary Sagna and Pablo Zabaleta. Another $176 million was invested on defenders Danilo, Benjamin Mendy and Kyle Walker.  All technically gifted, agile and fast, this trio was also a lot younger than their defensive predecessors.

Not even necessarily just on the pitch, absolutely everything. Team spirit I think is the biggest thing that under him that has changed so much.\"Reducing the age of the squad has also breathed new life into City's veteran players.Fernandinho, who turns 33 in May, has been the midfield lynchpin, much in the same way as Sergio Busquets was for Guardiola's Barcelona team. \"I think I'd go as far as saying if you didn't want to lose on outfield player this season it probably would be him,\" says Fairclough, referring to the Brazilian midfielder.Fernandinho's positional reading of the game has freed up Silva, 32, who has been nominated for player of the year, to wreak havoc against opposition defenses. \"Silva's role's changed, he's moved deeper which to be honest I've been looking forward to for years because he's that intelligent,\" Fairclough says. Manchester City's Argentine striker Sergio Aguero celebrates scoring against Newcastle United. Sergio Aguero, City's all-time leading goal scorer and still only 29, has enjoyed another fruitful year, contributing 21 goals. The Argentine has become a better all-round player under Guardiola this season.Meanwhile the younger members of the squad have flourished. Wingers Raheem Sterling and Leroy Sane have contributed 26 goals between them this season and Kevin De Bruyne has also been nominated for Player of the Year, playing deeper this season alongside Silva in those half-spaces.\"[De Bruyne's] had the game in front of him a lot more this season and I don't think it's any coincidence that his form has improved,\" Fairclough says.A lethal partnership:  City's flying wingers Raheem Sterling (L) and teammate Leroy Sane.Questions still remainHowever, despite their domination, it's arguable questions still remain over Pep's side. Before their Champions League quarterfinal tie against Liverpool, City were being talked about as potentially the greatest team of the Premier League era. But, three defeats in a week and being knocked out of Europe has changed that thinking. City lost both quarterfinal legs against Liverpool, and those defeats have once again brought Guardiola's European record under scrutiny. Since winning two European Cups in his three seasons with Barcelona, a pattern has seemingly emerged with Guardiola's Bayern and City sides starting their domestic campaigns incredibly strongly and then tiring by the time they get to the business end of the season. In his three years in Germany, Pep reached the semifinals of the Champions League each year before falling short, despite running away with the Bundesliga title every season. David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne have dominated teams this season with brilliant inventive football.City has fared worse in the Champions League. In Guardiola's first season, they were knocked out in the last 16 by Monaco on away goals before this season's 5-1 aggregate defeat to Liverpool. Despite having spent $373 million last year and assembling the most expensive soccer team in the history of the game -- valued at over $1 billion -- Guardiola still has a lot to ponder going into next season. The biggest one is the defense. Captain Vincent Kompany is City's most consistent center-back but has just turned 32 and the Belgian is constantly blighted by fitness concerns. His fellow center-backs Nicolas Otamendi and John Stones are still prone to errors and January recruit Aymeric Laporte has played the majority of games out of position since he came in. Guardiola also faces problems at left-back. Benjamin Mendy's has just returned from a cruciate ligament injury that he sustained early in the season, and while he has been out, City has looked a little exposed in the big games. Fernandinho has acted as the lynchpin for the whole team to revolve around -- a pivotal cog in City's machine.Silva, and Fernandinho, two of City's most important players are also now approaching the twilight of their careers, with Guardiola already admitting that the Spaniard, will not be able to play as much next season.\"Next season, David maybe will not play every game, that's why the squad has to be big,\" he told the Manchester Evening News. The worry for the rest of the Premier League is that City has ran away with the championship despite these obvious areas for improvement. And if City gets its transfers right in the summer, this could be the start of another era of Guardiola domination.",

        "content": "(CNN)A Russian reporter known for his investigations into Russian mercenaries in Syria died after a fall from his apartment in the city of Yekaterinburg, raising fresh concern about threats to independent journalists.   Maxim Borodin fell from his fifth-floor apartment and died Sunday, according to a statement released by his employer, Novy Den (New Day). Local police said they did not see any foul play, but his death prompted intense speculation among friends and colleagues. Valery Gorelykh, spokesman for the Interior Ministry for the Sverdlovsk region, told CNN that Borodin's apartment was locked from the inside, a fact that he said indicated \"no one exited the apartment and most likely there were no strangers in there.\" Russia's Investigative Committee, the country's main investigative body, said there were no indications of a crime, and that multiple causes of death were being probed. Polina Rumyantseva, editor in chief of Novy Den, said that there was no reason to suspect suicide.\"We were able to visit the apartment of Maxim, together with the police and forensic experts on Friday, the intermediate conclusion is that Maxim fell out of the balcony of his apartment where he probably was smoking,\" she said. \"As Maxim had big plans for his personal life and career, there is nothing to support a verdict of suicide.\"Read MoreOthers fear his death may not have been accidental.Borodin's friend, Vyacheslav Bashkov, wrote on Facebook that Borodin contacted him early in the morning on April 11 and said his building was surrounded by armed \"siloviki,\" or Russian security services, wearing camouflage and face masks.According to Bashkov, Borodin believed his apartment was about to be searched and that the security officers were waiting for a court order. Bashkov said the reporter asked to find him a lawyer, but an hour later Borodin called back and said it was a false alarm.Leonid Volkov, another acquaintance of Borodin who was head of Yekaterinburg headquarters for Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, cast doubt on the reports of a mysterious death. But he also suggested that the journalist most likely committed suicide out of desperation: Volkov said that Borodin wanted to move to Moscow, hoping to find an outlet that would give him more freedom to write.\"This story is not about how the regime kills one journalist who writes on inconvenient topics,\" Volkov wrote on Facebook. \"This is the story of how the regime kills thousands of journalists, all of them embodied [in Borodin], depriving them of any prospect, forcing them to choose between honor and a piece of bread every day.\"Borodin regularly covered high-profile corruption cases and crime in Russia. In February, he broke a story about Russian mercenaries who died in an armed confrontation with US forces near Deir-Ezzor, Syria. Borodin wrote about three members of Wagner, a private military company linked to pro-Putin oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin.Prigozhin, who is under US sanctions, is alleged to have made a systematic effort to silence reports of his activities. Borodin was previously targeted for his views.Last year, he gave an interview to a Russian independent channel TV Rain and talked about the controversial film \"Matilda,\" and was subsequently hit on the head by an unknown assailant with a metal pipe, according to a Facebook post.Russia ranks first in the European Federation of Journalists list of countries with the highest number of journalists murdered in Europe. Since 1990, 346 journalists and media staff have been killed in Europe, and a third lost their lives in Russia.In a statement on Twitter, Harlem D\u00e9sir, the media freedom representative for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, an intergovernmental body, expressed \"serious concern\" about Borodin's death.\"I call on the authorities for a swift and thorough investigation,\" he said.",

There were also construction delays, infrastructure problems and poor ticket sales. \"Post-Delhi a lot of soul searching was done, in terms of the relevance of the Commonwealths and the Games,\" Grevemberg says.

It's like walking into a room full of elephants and pretending they're not there. \"We have to be bigger than that, be better than that, if we truly want to have the impact we want.\"We all have this history, it's what we do with it. \"By attacking some of these issues straight on, by creating a willingness to listen to people, we really can change the dial.

It was a reminder that the host nation's past did not begin some 200 years ago with colonial rule.There was backlash -- mainly from those complaining about too much Indigenous content -- but Grevemberg has since said he would not change a thing.

There were demonstrations during the Queen's Baton relay and before the opening ceremony, with protestors wanting to draw international attention to Australia's colonial history and the social injustices its First Nations peoples still experience.  On basic standards of living, from health to education and employment, Australia's Indigenous population is being left behind. Life expectancy is lower, while infant mortality rates and maternal mortality is far higher than that of the general population. \"There's a lot of work to be done. I know Australia has a lot of discussion right now and a broader debate on racism,\" says Grevemberg of the protests. 'There's a lot of work to be done. People who have felt trauma and anger from the past, to give people the opportunity to express themselves in a peaceful manner is very reflective of the modern Commonwealth.\"A smoking ceremony -- an ancient tradition in Indigenous culture -- was performed at the opening ceremony.Will the Commonwealth Games continue to make a difference on the Gold Coast once the grandstands have been dismantled and the focused switched to Birmingham in 2022?\"In 2015, 71 territories unanimously agreed to a new vision of the organization, put it on the line that we want to build peaceful, sustainable, and prosperous communities globally, not just the Commonwealth,\" says Grevemberg.\"We want to be a trailblazer that can influence other countries and nations worldwide.\"There's various degrees of discourse and turbulence out there, but we want to be the consistent beacon for these types of conversations and, more importantly, action.\"The CGF has yet to provide CNN with requested details of how many members of the Indigenous population have worked at the Games. \"We will be taking the lessons learned from here and instigating a number of initiatives with Indigenous communities across the Commonwealth in terms of discourse and discussion in how we establish a declaration in Indigenous reconciliation through sport,\" added Grevemberg.\"One of the things we've already done in our host city contract, for 2022 and beyond, is that if you do host the Commonwealth Games there's a requirement that you promote and respect Indigenous people. It's obligatory. That's putting our money where our mouth is, so to speak.\"Too costly to host?The question many ask, however is: who can afford to host the Games? Come 2022, five of the last six Games will have been hosted in either the UK or Australia, two of the world's most affluent nations. Durban -- which was set to become the first African city to host an event which was first held in 1930 -- was stripped of its right to hold the Games in four years' time as the South African city did not meet the criteria set by the CGF. JUST WATCHEDRecord Breakers: Dane Bird-SmithReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRecord Breakers: Dane Bird-Smith 00:59Few rushed to replace Durban as hosts, with the English city of Birmingham eventually winning the bid. Hosting the Games will not come cheaply for England's second most populous city, with the projected overall cost of the Games running to a reported $1 billion. \"Ten of the top 20 emerging cities are in the Commonwealth so there' s huge opportunities there,\" said Grevemberg of potential future hosts. \"We're no longer the men and women of Del Monte coming to inspect the fruit and acting as auditor general. \"We're now actually partners with cities and working in tandem with them to reduce costs and make the Games more affordable and amplify the value of the event. \"We brought Glasgow 2014 in \u00a337m [$53.7m] below budget and that wasn't by accident.\"Cities wanting to host a Games which has a social conscience -- transgender weightlifter Lauren Hubbard was supported by the Federation, while Gold Coast 2018 was the first multi-discipline sport event to award an equal number of medals to men and women -- will also be obliged to uphold the United Nation's guiding principles on human rights. This week England's diver Tom Daley made a plea for 37 competing nations that sill criminalize homosexuality to relax their anti-gay laws. Cities will not be prevented from bidding, but they may be required to adapt and change if their bids are to succeed. Do major stars still cherish the Commonwealths?There is also the issue of whether the world's biggest stars regard the Commonwealth Games as a priority in an increasingly crammed sporting calendar. Canada's Andre de Grasse, 200m silver and 100m bronze Olympic medalist, widely regarded as Usain Bolt's heir apparent, was missing as he wanted to \"be ready for a strong and full outdoor season.\"Kenya's 800m world record holder David Rudisha and two-time 1500m Olympic champion Asbel Kiprop were also absent, as were their country's elite marathon runners.

The All Black Sevens have now claimed five out of six gold medals since the event began back in the 1998 Games. Their only loss was against South Africa who won gold four years ago in Glasgow. Follow @cnnsport\n\nNew Zealand started the game in blistering fashion, Etene Nanai-Setro producing the first try of the game, with a powerful surge to break through the Fijian line.The 18-year-old Nanai-Setro, who is of Fijian descent, produced a superb performance showing why so many have him pegged as a player with a big future. Regan Ware then created a second try for New Zealand with some individual magic to put them 14-0 ahead.New Zealand flew out of the blocks, scoring two tries in quick succession in the first half.Read MoreFiji have lit up this sevens tournament with some dazzling displays, notably with wins over Wales and reigning champions South Africa in the semifinals.But with the game running away from this big and physcial Fiji side, tempers started to flare and Sevuloni Mocenecagi and New Zealand's Sam Dixon were involved in a heated exchange. Mocenecagi then flew into Dixon with a high tackle, leaving the New Zealander in a crumpled heap on the ground and in need of medical attention. The Commonwealth Games is supposed to be the \"Friendly Games\" but this was anything but. The New Zealand bench was up and the players were furious. Regan Ware breaks through a Fijian tackle to score New Zealand's second try of the final.However, the referee adjudged that Mocenecagi had first made contact with Dixon's chest and produced a yellow rather than a red card.With Mocenecagi languishing in the sin bin, New Zealand looked to have converted a third try with just seconds remaining in the first half, but after reviewing the incident the video ref decided that  Ware had spilled the ball.READ: Does the Commonwealth Games have a future? Mocenecagi was still off the field when play resumed but you wouldn't have noticed as Fiji started the second half on top and only a brilliant saving tackle from All Black captain Scott Curry  prevented the Fijians from getting a try back. \"Scott Curry's tackle on the far side [to stop a Fiji try] was unbelievable. He made a similar one yesterday [Saturday]. Your defense always shows how tight you are as a group and I think that shone through tonight,\" New Zealand coach Clark Laidlaw told New Zealand website Stuff.co.nz.The tackle would set the tone for the second half with New Zealand putting on a defensive masterclass.

Follow @cnnsport\n\nThe world's No. 1 ranked team, who beat England 26-5 in the semifinals earlier in the day, have been impressive throughout the tournament and after tries from Portia Woodman and Michela Byde the Kiwis led at half-time 12-0.But roared on by the home crowd, the Aussies fought back in the second half. A try from co-captain Emilee Cherry got them back into the contest and with a minute remaining on the clock, Ellia Green used her blistering pace to level the scores.READ: Does the Commonwealth Games have a future? Read MoreAustralia could have gone ahead in the final few seconds of the match but they missed their conversion kick.Deep into overtime, Australia then won possession and looked to have an opportunity for one last attack, but instead Cassie Staples kicked the ball into touch taking the game into extra-time. It was a decision that would prove costly. In extra time New Zealand's Kelly Brazier breaks through the Australian defense to score the winning try and win gold for Australia.Knowing that the first score would end the game, extra-time started in a scrappy fashion. With the searing heat bearing down on the players and tiredness showing on both sides, there were fumbles and plenty of other errors.It looked as if the game would need one more period of extra-time to decide the contest, but then Kelly Brazier of New Zealand took possession close to her own goal line. The 28-year-old shimmied past one player, dropped her shoulder to move past the next, and accelerated away, leaving three Australian defenders in her slipstream.\"I'm probably not the quickest, but I pride myself on my fitness. Obviously it was 19 minutes in so I had a bit of a look around and thought it's now or nothing, so just went for it,\" Brazier told New Zealand website Stuff.co.nz after the game. \"I had a few chasing but just thought I'm gonna go and it paid off in the end.\"New Zealand were leading 12-0 at the half, before an Australian fightback forced the game into extra-time. Running nearly the entire length of the field she made the historic try, collapsing in exhaustion at the goal line as her teammates piled on top of her to celebrate.\"All I could feel was my lungs going up and down in the air. I was just worried about trying to catch my breath back and then the girls just jumped on top of me so it made it a bit hard to breathe.

Follow @cnnsport\n\nReal and Bayern have faced off three times in the knockout phase already since 2012, with the La Liga outfit triumphing twice including 6-3 on aggregate in last season's quarterfinal that necessitated extra time. Both are very familiar with being at this stage. Real are appearing in the semis for an eighth straight season and Bayern have been in the final four in four of the past five.

Read More\"It's a difficult draw for both sides. But we don't know whether it would have been easier against Roma or Liverpool. We have to take it as it is.\"Just how Bayern -- the only team in the semis leading its domestic league; the other three are well behind in theirs -- will stop Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the key questions. The prolific Portuguese tormented Bayern with five goals last season. And this season he has scored in a record 11 straight Champions League games, keeping his cool Wednesday when netting a penalty deep in injury time to eliminate Juventus in the tense battle of last year's finalists. The record 12-time competition winners so nearly paid the price for sitting back at the Bernabeu nursing a 3-0 first-leg lead, with the \"Old Lady\" of Italian football mounting a comeback to level the tie at 3-3 prior to the late penalty drama. READ: Incensed Buffon sees redRamos returnBut if Ronaldo figures to be in the spotlight yet again, don't forget the potential return of Real's influential central defender Sergio Ramos. The club captain sat out the second leg against Juventus due to a suspension and would normally be expected to resume his duties against Bayern. Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates after scoring the decisive goal for Real Madrid against Juventus. According to reports though, the combustible Ramos could miss at least the first leg of the semis for coming down from the stands Wednesday to join in the celebrations. Bayern cruised to the semifinals in overcoming Sevilla 2-1 on aggregate and in Heynckes have the man who led the German powerhouse to the treble in 2013, highlighted by a fifth title in the Champions League or European Cup. The former Real boss is expected to retire at the end of the season and Bayern named his replacement Friday in Eintracht Frankfurt manager Niko Kovac.The 46-year-old Kovac, who spent most of his playing career as a central midfielder in Germany, was a Croatian international and formerly guided the Croatian national team. He'll no doubt be keeping an eye on his future, higher-profile team in the semifinals. Roma president Jim Pallotta jumped into one of Rome's famous fountains in joy after his team stunned Barcelona in the quarterfinals and said he didn't mind who the Giallorossi got next. READ: Messi, Barcelona exit But truth be told, Liverpool -- who engineered an upset of their own by eliminating Manchester City -- and Roma were probably chuffed to draw each other. The clash is a rematch of the 1984 final Liverpool won, with that season also marking the last occasion Roma advanced to the semifinals. A dejected Lionel Messi and Barcelona were ousted by Roma. \"Liverpool have made a statement similar to ours by knocking out the team I thought might be the favorites to win it all, Manchester City,\" Roma's veteran captain Daniele de Rossi told the team's Facebook page.Roma completely shut down Lionel Messi in the second leg Tuesday and their task now will be to foil Salah, another diminutive left-footer who can dribble and finish with aplomb.Apart from leading the Premier League in scoring, Salah is tied for second in the Champions League this term -- behind Ronaldo of course -- alongside hard-working teammate Roberto Firmino and Sevilla's Wissam Ben Yedder on eight goals. Salah a fan favorite in Rome Salah was a firm fan favorite in Rome but according to Football Italia, facing financial difficulties and dealing with UEFA's Financial Fair Play regulations, Roma were essentially forced to sell the Egyptian striker.

I felt like I needed to do other stuff and he couldn't understand what other stuff I wanted to do. \"I had a marriage and family, but I felt so empty. I needed something else. I forgot myself. \"We decided to compromise and find a balance halfway. He would visit monthly, but we drifted apart. \"If I'd known moving to Tonga would break up my family, I wouldn't have done it.\"READ: Eight Cameroon athletes go missing at Australia's Commonwealth GamesREAD: Mary Kom: Get to know India's boxing superstarA toxic relationship, bringing shame on the familyLonely and lost in Tonga, the now single Dubois became involved in a relationship which quickly turned toxic. The once responsible mother who rarely drank alcohol now drowned her sorrows in wine and liquor. Evenings would end in the police station after yet another quarrel with the man she knew she had no future. Negativity consumed her. \"I have big regrets, the regret of not being a mother to my daughter,\" says a melancholic Dubois, sitting around a table in the athletes' village. Wearing her red and white Tongan tracksuit, she blends in with many of the athletes coming and going around the plaza, though few will be afflicted by such torment. Lawn bowls have changed the life of one Commonwealth competitor, Caroline Dubois. \"My husband was such a gentleman, a good father, a good provider,\" she says, her voice trailing off. \"Just to think of those days ... it was a shock to my family and friends how I became someone else. I was argumentative, fighting with my family. They despised my boyfriend and I was fighting for him.  \"It became abusive. It was a vicious circle. Here I was trying to fix him, and he thinks he can fix me and in between we're fixing it with alcohol. \"Tonga is not a big place and our family is respectful, a hard-working successful family. I go to the graveyard and have a cry there and just hope my parents can see me now.\"Moving to New Zealand, but refusing to changeDubois, this once healthy, affluent family woman, became to look older than her years. Her youngest sister, Pele, made one last attempt at trying to stop her gaunt sibling from self-destructing, giving Dubois a ticket to join her in Auckland, the city where she grew up and attended college before moving to Australia.\"I went to Auckland and my boyfriend was nasty on the phone, making me feel guilty, and I fell for that and I'd be back on the plane and my family kept paying for the ticket to take me back,\" Dubois remembers. During the school holidays Dubois' daughter, who lived with her father in Melbourne, would visit, but Dubois was not yet ready to be a mum to her only child. To the lawn bowls club, to a new obsessionDubois' family continued to search for solutions for the loved one they no longer recognized. But she was still drinking, still unhappy.They invited Dubois to the local lawn bowls club where Dubois' niece, a promising player, would bowl. The Broadbeach Bowls Club is the venue for lawn bowling at the Commonwealth Games. She had no interest in the sport, but knew the alcohol would be cheap. \"I'd drink too much, and my sister and I would be at loggerheads around members, her friends,\" she says. \"It was terrible. In her good heart she thought going to the bowls club would keep me busy, but I saw it as an opportunity to drink. I'd be so embarrassed the next day.\"With another visit from Stephanie on the horizon, and following a tearful discussion with Pele, Dubois agreed to attend a training session at the bowls club.Life began to change.\"When it was explained that bowls wasn't easy and that it's an art of line and weight, I thought 'That's challenging, I love challenges.' I'll take up this challenge,\" says Dubois, offering up a rare smile. Bowling come rain or shineDubois doesn't recall the moment when bowls became more important than booze, but she does remember lying in bed thinking about her new hobby rather than a bar. A healthy obsession had replaced a destructive one. She was always early to training sessions, listening attentively to her coaches. She would practice in the rain, in the piercing sun, even sneak onto the green when the club was closed. Family would ring her mobile, but there would be no answer. Dubois was on the green, \"rolling it up and down.\"\"The more I got into it, slowly my mental state was starting to change,\" she says, attempting to offer an explanation to a transformation she herself cannot fully shed a light on. \"I got more involved in training, got to know members' names and I started to think outside of me. It had previously all been about me, me, me. \"I was starting to separate myself from the negativity. I was breathing bowls. I couldn't wait to get up and go to the green and my family supported me. They'd drive me to games. The old me came back.\"Caroline Dubois and her Tongan teammate with the New Zealand pairs at the Commonwealth Games.With practice Dubois became good. Very good. In her first year she won an Auckland championship as a fours and shortly after was asked to represent her region, North Harbour -- one of New Zealand's best teams. \"I was so excited,\" she says. \"So much had changed so quickly. I had to slap my face. I'd beat all these women ... my name would start appearing in post sections, center websites, etc. \"We were given a mental skills coach and I think that was another saving grace for me. It helped my bowling, but it also helped me personally, though they don't know that. \"It was getting me back together, it was a big part in what set me straight. I never touched a drink, I was never even interested in alcohol. I'd have the odd drink after a game but as time went on I wasn't having that drink, I refused it. \"I don't know how the hell it happened, picking up that bowl, progressing and proving to myself that I could do it has saved me in so many ways.\"If I wasn't doing this where would I be? Would I be dead? Sometimes I used to think 'Who cares about tomorrow?' That awful side was winning.\"Commonwealth selection, elation, tears, February 2018. Two years have passed since Dubois first held a bowl in her hand. She receives an email from Tonga's lawn bowls association, confirming that she will partner Malia Kioa, a fellow New Zealand resident whom she had never met, at the Commonwealths.  Caroline Dubois with her daughter and sister at the athletes' village.\"One sister said: 'Hang on, I think I'm just having a heart attack right now' when I told her,\" says Dubois, laughing at the memory.  \"Two other sisters are in Melbourne ... to hear the squeal of excitement when I called them. I could just imagine the tears that came with it.\"My daughter never answers her mobile, never answers a text, so I texted her and said: 'Can you keep a secret?' and she replied straight away. I said: 'Mum is going to the Commonwealth Games to play for Tonga.' I never got a reply back!\"Unbeknown to me at the time, she'd left her phone and ran to her dad and I got a call from him saying 'Are you serious?' \"I have spoken to him more in the last month than I did in the last five years. He's remarried. I am happy for him, but sad for what I lost, but I can't bring it back. I can't live with regrets.\"'Go, Mummy!'Dubois' daughter, her ex-husband, Bruno, and sister Pele are watching her first match, against Norfolk Islands. \"Go Mummy!\" screams Stephanie. Dubois does not want the match to end.  Photos: Exploring Australia's Gold CoastAustralia's stunning Gold Coast will stage the 2018 Comonwealth Games from April 4-15.

I was everywhere,\" she admits.\"They were only here for the weekend, so I knew 'This is it, after this match they're going to run off to catch the plane.' \"I wanted the ends to keep going because that meant Stephanie would stay. \"As soon as the match was over, my husband pointed at his watch, saying they had to go.

You go and get them.' \"Everyone has those demons and I'm sure there are worse demons than my demons. Hopefully, it'll inspire people.\"I find myself telling people 'find something you're passionate about, no matter what it is.' \"I found it and I went with it.

It is, she says, a marvelous vista. She can see everything, athletes sitting on giant bean bags in the courtyard, others sometimes playing a giant Connect Four. Live music emanates from the bar. Tears will slide down her cheeks.\"Sometimes I just need that quiet moment to think about what I was looking for back then,\" says Dubois, looking into the distance. \"I never found it. I thought I wanted freedom, but what was I looking for? I still can't answer that. \"How much I've drunk I really don't know, but obviously I drank a lot because by the time I got to Auckland I had no money left and I did have money so that's a lot of money spent.\"Everyone said I was turning into an alcoholic, which I probably was, but in my mind I wasn't. \"Now the joke is I'm an international sports person!\"Someone asked me: 'What would the Caroline today say to the Caroline of five years ago?' I'd say: 'You bloody idiot.' \"Sometimes I cry for her. I don't see her as me. I don't want to know about her, but I still mourn her. Here I am talking about her in the third person ...

Richard denied the allegation and he has never faced charges.A barrister representing Richard told the court that the coverage -- which included shots taken from a helicopter while the search was ongoing -- was a \"very serious invasion\" of privacy, the PA reported.Lawyers representing the BBC have said the raid was of \"legitimate public interest\" and that the broadcaster had a duty to pass information about the investigation on to the public.British singer Cliff Richard won't face sex abuse chargesWhile giving his witness statement, Richard seemed on the verge of tears as he listed a number of countries where he says his reputation was damaged, the PA said.Read More\"Everywhere I have ever been, I felt my name was smeared,\" he said. \"The police didn't do that, the BBC did.\"The journalists involved \"felt they were above the law,\" Richard added, holding his face in his hands, according to the PA.Richard -- born Harry Rodger Webb -- has sold more than 250 million records in a career that began in the 1950s.

        "content": "London (CNN)Russia has run programs investigating methods of delivering nerve agents, \"including by application to door handles,\" and is \"highly likely\" responsible for the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, according to intelligence made public by the UK on Friday.In a letter to the NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, UK national security adviser Mark Sedwill says there is \"no plausible alternative explanation\" for the attack in Salisbury on March 4 that left the Skripals hospitalized. \"Only Russia has the technical means, operational experience and the motive,\" he writes.Police believe the pair first came into contact with the nerve agent, identified by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons as Novichok, at Sergei Skripal's home. The highest concentration of the substance was found on the front door.'Pure' Novichok used in Skripal attack, watchdog confirmsYulia was discharged from the hospital earlier this week and is being kept in an unknown location. Her father remains hospitalized but is no longer in critical condition.Read MoreRussia has denied all involvement in the incident, which the UK blames on Moscow, and which has led to a spiraling diplomatic dispute between the two nations.In a statement Thursday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the Kremlin \"will not take on faith any conclusions regarding the Skripal case until Russian experts are provided with access to the victims themselves, as well as to the materials mentioned in the OPCW's expert report and the entire volume of information available to London.\"Police believe Sergei and Yulia Skripal came into contact with the nerve agent at the former spy's home in Salisbury.Russia 'stockpiling Novichoks'In his letter, Sedwill outlines how the Soviet Union \"developed a new class of 'fourth generation' nerve agents, known as Novichoks\" during the 1980s and Russia was probably the only former Soviet republic to pursue \"an offensive chemical weapons programme after independence.\"He identifies a branch of the Russian research institute at Shikhany near Volgograd in southern Russia as being largely responsible for that work. The same facility was named in a report by British newspaper The Times last week as the location where the nerve agent used on the Skripals was manufactured, with the paper citing British security sources.Nerve agent victim Yulia Skripal rebuffs cousin, Russian offers of helpMikhail Babich, the Kremlin's envoy in the Volga Federal District, rejected the report. \"All the bases where chemical weapons were stored are well known,\" he told Interfax news agency. \"Shikhany is not one of them.\"Sedwill goes on to claim that Russia was likely the only former Soviet republic to pursue \"an offensive chemical weapons programme after independence.\"\"It is unlikely that Novichok could be made and deployed by non-state actors,\" he adds.He then describes how Russia later launched a program to test methods of delivering chemical warfare agents and to train personnel in their use.\"This programme subsequently included investigation of ways of delivering nerve agents, including by application to door handles,\" the letter says. \"Within the last decade, Russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of Novichoks under the same programme.\"Defectors seen as 'legitimate targets'Regarding the Skripals themselves, Sedwill claims that email accounts belonging to Yulia Skripal were targeted by Russian intelligence agents in 2013, \"indicating Russian intelligence service interest in the Skripals.\"\"It is highly likely that the Russian intelligence services view at least some of its defectors as legitimate targets for assassinations,\" Sedwill writes, alluding to a possible motive for the attack on Sergei Skripal, a former Russian military official convicted of being a British spy.He argues that \"Russia has a proven record of conducting state-sponsored assassination,\" referencing the murder of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in 2006. A UK public inquiry concluded there was a \"strong probability\" the poisoning was directed by the FSB, Russia's top security agency. Shortly after the attack in Salisbury, UK Home Secretary Amber Rudd asked police and intelligence agency MI5 to look into further allegations of Russian state involvement in a number of deaths in the UK, prompted by a Buzzfeed report alleging Russian links to 14 suspicious deaths in the UK.Russia's ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, said on Friday that the claims that his country's intelligence agencies spied on the Skripals were a \"big surprise,\" but added that he had not yet seen Sedwill's letter.\"If somebody was spying, why were the British services not complaining about it, because they always complain if something goes wrong in their country or somewhere else,\" he said during a news conference in London.",

The man -- who has not been named -- is suspected of gathering information about exiles' family relationships, addresses, political affiliations and meetings with the intent to \"pass this information to representatives of the Chinese state,\" authorities said Wednesday, according to CNN affiliate Expressen. Prosecutor Mats Ljungqvist said the man's alleged spying occurred between July 2015 and February 2017, and the information was transmitted to Chinese officials in Poland and Finland.Ljungqvist said the man was himself of Tibetan descent and had been spying \"for a long time, and may have caused or may cause a large number of persons serious harm.\" China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement Thursday it was \"not aware of the situation.\" Swedish authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Swedish citizen Gui Minhai was abducted by Chinese police while traveling with Swedish diplomats in China. Swedish citizen still in custodyAlleged spying by China on Swedish residents could further damage relations between Stockholm and Beijing, which were already damaged by the continued detention of Swedish citizen Gui Minhai. Gui, one of several Hong Kong-based booksellers detained by China since 2014, was seized by plainclothes police on a train in January in front of Swedish diplomats. \"The brutal intervention in January against a Swedish support operation was conducted in spite of repeated assurances from the Chinese authorities that Mr. Gui was free at that time,\" Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom said in February after Beijing confirmed it had detained Gui.  \"The current situation also raises questions about the application of the rule of law, including the prohibition of arbitrary deprivation of liberty. We demand that our citizen be given the opportunity to meet Swedish diplomatic and medical staff, and that he be released so that he can be reunited with his daughter and family.\"Gui, 53, who wrote and published numerous titles critical of the Communist leadership, was traveling to Beijing to be examined by a Swedish doctor at the embassy when he was taken, his daughter Angela told Radio Sweden last month.JUST WATCHEDChinese human rights lawyer sentencedReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHChinese human rights lawyer sentenced 03:53Cyber espionage Swedish media reported on the arrest of a man last year for similar spying activities.

The Tibetan community in India -- where the majority of exiles live -- has been targeted for over a decade by cyber espionage operations most analysts link to China. In January, the Toronto-based Citizen Lab uncovered a hacking operation that \"ran for 19 months, and which targeted the Tibetan community, and potentially other groups including ethnic minorities, social movements related to China, a media group, and government agencies in South and Southeast Asia.\" Choedon said she was aware of the hacking risk, but said it was just one element in a broader intimidation campaign against Tibetans abroad. \"Even though they are living in a free country, still they cannot really enjoy their full free democratic rights,\" she said.

Until it becomes a true issue and it is established they have outstayed their visas or formerly applied for asylum, we will monitor the situation,\" he said.It's not known if any of those 11 missing athletes have approached Ready Migration.JUST WATCHEDAthletes take the CNN Commonwealth Games QuizReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAthletes take the CNN Commonwealth Games Quiz 02:12READ: Eight Cameroon athletes go missing at Australia's Commonwealth GamesREAD: Mary Kom: Get to know India's boxing superstarOn Wednesday, Cameroon's team attache Simon Molombe told CNN Sport he did not expect the missing athletes to return: \"I don't think they will be back,\" he said.There is a track record for athletes and officials disappearing in Australia during international sporting competitions, with 25 delegates going missing at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne and 80 athletes and officials outstaying their visas at the Sydney Olympics in 2000.

        "content": "(CNN)Last year's Champions League finalist Juventus is out of the competition despite a spirited 3-1 second leg win against Real Madrid Wednesday. The Italian giant came agonizingly close to overturning Real Madrid's three-goal first leg lead in the Spanish capital, but instead went down to a late penalty. It undid 98 minutes of work by a hard-running, passionate Juve. The Italian club was indebted to striker Mario Mandzukic, who put the team ahead almost as soon as the match had started with a powerful header, before replicating the feat 35 minutes later. The second leg of the match-up, a retread of the 2017 final, had looked a mountain to climb for Juve after Real's 3-0 thrashing of the Italian league leaders in Turin last week. But as the match wore on, an upset similar in scope to Roma's feats on Tuesday night against Barcelona suddenly looked a possibility, when Blaise Matuidi capitalized on a goalmouth fumble, poking home from short range to spark hope among the traveling fans. Juventus midfielder Blaise Matuidi celebrates his goal -- Juventus' third of the night -- during the tie. Read MoreTuesday's match at the Stadio Olimpico had seen an Italian team complete a three-goal comeback and seal its place in the last four of the tournament at the expense of a Spanish side, but ultimately the Bianconeri couldn't match the Romans' feat.Late heartbreakAs injury time ticked away and the possibility of another thrilling comeback looked tantalizingly close, Real's Lucas Vazquez was adjudged to have gone down under pressure in the box.The award of the late spot kick sparked long-time Juve goalkeeper and club talisman Gianluigi Buffon to unleash a torrent of invective against referee Michael Oliver, who duly showed the Italian a red. Juventus goalkeeper Buffon  argues with referee Michael Oliver following the award of a penalty to Real Madrid. The penalty's subsequent conversion by Real's Cristiano Ronaldo -- who, playing in his 150th Champions League game, scored his tenth against the Italian side -- in the 98th minute was enough to see the Spanish giants through to the last round with an aggregate score of 4-3. Bayern progressesElsewhere, it was a more routine affair with Bayern Munich holding Spanish side Sevilla to a goalless draw in the Bavarian city, to advance with a 2-1 aggregate score over the two legs. The German team, which sealed the Bundesliga title at the weekend, are through to a sixth Champions League semi-final in seven seasons. The night caps off a helter-skelter quarter-final round of the competition, which saw Roma advance at the expense of perennial favorites Barcelona in a thrilling three-goal comeback, while English side Liverpool put runaway Premier League leaders Manchester City to the sword. Friday will see the semi-final draw, where Bayern, Roma, Real Madrid and Liverpool will learn their opponents for the two-leg semi-finals, which commence at the end of April, with the return legs scheduled for the beginning of May.",

The latter is concluded from the almost complete absence of impurities.\"Britain has accused Russia of attempting to murder the Skripals using Novichok. Russia has repeatedly denied involvement in the attack, seeking to blame Britain instead.Read MoreIn a statement Thursday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow \"will not take on faith any conclusions regarding the Skripal case until Russian experts are provided with access to the victims themselves, as well as to the materials mentioned in the OPCW's expert report and the entire volume of information available to London.\"The OPCW sent a team of specialists to the UK last month to investigate the March 4 attack. The experts took samples from several locations as well as biomedical samples from the Skripals and police officer Nick Bailey, who was also exposed to the nerve agent.An image taken from Facebook of Yulia Skripal, daughter of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal.UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the testing was carried out by \"four independent, highly reputable laboratories around the world,\" all of which \"returned the same conclusive results.\"\"There can be no doubt what was used and there remains no alternative explanation about who was responsible -- only Russia has the means, motive and record,\" Johnson said in a statement.\"In the interest of transparency, and because unlike the Russians we have nothing to hide, we have asked the OPCW to publish the executive summary for all to see and to circulate the full report to all state parties of the OPCW, including Russia.Former Soviet chemist shares details of the nerve agent Novichok \"We will now work tirelessly with our partners to help stamp out the grotesque use of weapons of this kind and we have called a session of the OPCW Executive Council next Wednesday to discuss next steps. The Kremlin must give answers.\"The United Kingdom has called for a UN Security Council meeting to discuss the OPCW report, according to a tweet from the UK mission to the United Nations. The meeting is likely to take place next week, according to the tweet.German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas urged Russia to answer \"open questions\" regarding the report and welcomed Britain's call for a special OPCW executive council session next week.\"Based on the chemical analysis of the substance used, the United Kingdom has also explained in detail why Russia's responsibility is very probable and there is no plausible alternative explanation,\" Maas said in a statement. \"Russia is now called upon to finally take on a constructive role and to answer.\"Russia lost a vote at the OPCW earlier this month to have a joint UK-Russian investigation into the Salisbury attack. Moscow has repeatedly complained that it has been denied information on the UK probe and access to the Skripals, as Russian citizens.In a statement Wednesday, Yulia Skripal said she did not need help from Russian diplomats in the UK and cautioned the media that no one else speaks for her or her father, who is still in a British hospital. Yulia was discharged from the hospital on Monday.Investigators work in the garden of Sergei Skripal's house in Salisbury on March 22.In his first public speech as director of the UK surveillance agency GCHQ, Jeremy Fleming described the Salisbury attack as \"sobering.\"\"It demonstrates how reckless Russia is prepared to be,\" he said. \"How little the Kremlin cares for the international rules-based order. How comfortable they are at putting ordinary lives at risk.\" Fleming added that the \"robust response\" from the UK and the international community \"shows the Kremlin that illegal acts have consequences.\"The chief executive of the Porton Down defense laboratory in the UK said earlier this month that scientists could not confirm where the nerve agent was made. The British government insisted that additional material from intelligence sources led it to the conclusion that Russia was behind the attack.CNN's Nathan Hodge, Nadine Schmidt and Richard Roth contributed to this report.",

Something like, 'what are you doing -- what is that?Read More\"But I was not able to defend myself properly, probably because I was scared.\"Russian journalist Daria Zhuk in Moscow in March. During the weeks leading up to the incident, Zhuk says she had fended off Slutsky's unwanted advances delivered by phone and text messages, but she never imagined that it would get physical in person.Zhuk is one of three female journalists who have accused Slutsky, chairman of the State Duma's committee on foreign relations, of inappropriate behavior toward them. Slutsky has denied all allegations.By going public with her story, Zhuk hopes the conversation around sexual harassment, which is not a punishable offense in Russia, might change. In some ways that conversation is already shifting. Zhuk and her colleagues' MeToo moments have been met with support from many Russian media outlets \u2014 an unexpected show of solidarity in a country where outspoken discord is often silenced. The producer had first met Slutsky when he was a guest on another show. Shortly after that meeting, he invited her out for dinner. She declined. After she invited him to speak on the network's political evening program in November, Slutsky continued to send messages to her in a \"vulgar, dirty way,\" and threatened to pull out of the show until the very last minute.She consistently rejected him \"politely,\" emphasizing that the invitation to appear as a guest on the TV station's \"Hard Day's Night\" program was purely professional.When Zhuk told a senior male colleague about the indecent messages, he responded that the member of parliament was kind of an \"awful person,\" but the independent network, which had been partially banned by the State, wanted him on the program to boost ratings. Determined to keep the show running smoothly, Zhuk says she chose a tactic of non-reply with him.Patriarchal normsZhuk immediately reported the incident in the newsroom to two male colleagues who escorted Slutsky out after the show finished. Aleksandra Perepelova, acting editor-in-chief of TV Dhozd who was a producer there at the time of the alleged assault, tells CNN the outlet didn't invite the lawmaker back after that incident. \"We have just now started developing a good habit to speak up loudly and discuss such things,\" Perepelova adds.For nearly four years, Zhuk never spoke publicly about it, as is the norm in Russia.\"There is no understanding of boundaries, the line between flirtation and unacceptable behavior, harassment and touching,\" she says.And those messages are ingrained early. \"I've encountered these kinds of problems even when I was a child... when I was a little girl, big men used to come up to me on the street and make indecent proposals. So, since my childhood I'm used to this happening. It's awful, but it's happening.\"At least 3 women have accused Russian MP Leonid Slutsky of sexual harrassment. On February 22, Zhuk anonymously detailed allegations against Slutsky in a report published by her employer, TV Dozhd. Slutsky denied the allegations, writing on Facebook on February 23: \"Attempts to make Slutsky into a Russian Harvey Weinstein look like a cheap and crude provocation ... and are bound to fail.\" CNN has been unable to reach Slutsky for comment on this story.A culture of quietLast month, Ekaterina Kotrikadze, now deputy chief editor of New York-based RTVI television, also broke her silence on Slutsky. Seven years later and now living halfway across the world, she says the incident is still not easy to talk about. Kotrikadze was 26 at the time and covering regional politics at a Georgian TV station when she arranged to interview Slutsky in Moscow. Kotrikadze says she was asked to come to the interview alone so that it could be off the record.When she arrived in his office, Kotrikadze says, Slutsky assaulted her.\"There was no conversation. He pushed me to the wall right away -- he tried to kiss me and touch me. I was shocked and astonished, and pushed him back,\" she remembers. \"He told me I wouldn't be able to go outside of the building because he had to sign some papers to let me out. But I ran to his secretary and she signed the paper -- then I ran away.\"Ekaterina Kotrikadze, deputy chief editor of New York-based RTVI television.Like Zhuk, Kotrikadze had never spoken about the incident publicly for years. She attributes that silence to a combination of fear and to living in a culturally conservative environment that she says blames and shames women. She was also worried about her personal safety and what speaking out could do to her career. \"[Slutsky] is a powerful man and Russia is in a world where the men decide.\"Women's rights in Russia lag well behind those of many other countries, according to the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report. Russia ranks 121 out of 144 countries for political empowerment and is in 71st place overall on the 2017 report, which examines gender imbalances in economics, the workplace, education, politics and health.Kotrikadze, now 34, works in the United States, where she has reported extensively on the MeToo movement. Slutsky refuted the accusations on TV Dozhd's website, calling them a \"a crude reception during the [presidential] election campaign,\" alluding to Kotrikadze's Georgian heritage.\"Odd that they couldn't find some Ukrainians or Americans to accuse me of this,\" he said.Signals of solidarityIn the run-up to Russia's recent presidential elections, Zhuk, along with Slutsky's third accuser, Farida Rustamova a journalist at the BBC, submitted their complaints to the Duma's ethics committee.They faced push-back from many lawmakers, including speaker of the Duma Vyacheslav Volodin, who on March 7 told journalists working in parliament to find other jobs if they thought it was dangerous to work there. Daria Zhuk and BBC journalist Farida Rustamova at the Duma's ethics committe meeting in Moscow on March 21.Slutsky has suggested that the women's allegations were part of a political smear campaign. Anton Morozov, deputy of the Duma, responded to the allegations sarcastically, writing a salacious open message to Slutsky that read: \"Mr. Slutsky, this is outrageous! Share some of this with the other members of the international affairs committee. I'm prepared to take a couple of journalist girls myself,\" according to a screenshot captured by Buzzfeed of the comment posted to Slutsky's Facebook page. On March 21, the Duma's ethics committee cleared Slutsky of multiple allegations of sexual harassment.  Zhuk and Kotrikadze weren't surprised by the result and were concerned by the language the committee used, which branded them liars. In the wake of the decision, some 40 independent media outlets staged a boycott, pulling their reporters from the lower house of parliament.Media outlets boycott Russian parliament over sexual harassment scandal In retaliation, Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin revoked accreditation from the boycotting media outlets. President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, has repeatedly dodged questions on the matter.In late March, speaking to students at a Moscow University, Peskov compared Harvey Weinstein's accusers to prostitutes, and questioned the Russian journalists' intentions in coming forward so late after their alleged encounters with Slutsky, RFE/RL reported.Many Russian lawmakers continue to tow the Kremlin's line, but some have taken to discrediting the allegations in the form of personal attacks on the women. After Slutsky was absolved of all of the charges the three women had launched against him, Raisa Karmazina, a member of parliament who sits on the ethics committee, said in an interview: \"I was three hundred times more beautiful than them! And smarter than them! I've been working for 50 years...since I was 18. No one ever harassed me.\"Surprising camaraderieZhuk and Kotrikadze don't expect attitudes to sexual harassment to change overnight -- but they do welcome the support, which they say continues to grow in unexpected ways.Odnoklassniki, one of Russia's biggest social networks, has supported the media boycott -- even a bar located across from the Duma said it wouldn't serve Slutsky or members of parliament supporting him, donning a banner that read \"Guys, you are not welcome till you change,\" on its doors. And in an act of surprising solidarity, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova also accused Slutsky of indecent behavior: \"Leonid [Slutsky] started saying things...that I found very unpleasant.\"Russian police detain an activist  holding a cardboard cut out of Slutsky in front Moscow's State Duma on April 3.Last week, a group of protesters planned a single-picket demonstration outside the Duma with women taking turns standing alone next to a cardboard cutout of Slutsky that read: \"I don't get handy. Well, maybe a bit,\" a reference to his comments after Rustamova, from the BBC, accused Slutsky of groping her. Authorities quickly shut it down, saying the protesters didn't have the approval to demonstrate. In Russia, applications for rallies, protests or public events must be filed and approved by authorities. Organizers say they plan to continue demonstrating with single-person protests until they get permission to hold a mass rally.Displays of support are also happening discreetly. Kotrikadze says she has received messages of support from female colleagues who work at state-run media. She says they can't boycott or speak out for fear of losing their jobs. And Zhuk has received surprising messages too: some former high-level officials have written to her in support.In Russia traditional values hold firm and the MeToo movement has largely been written off as a foreign conceit. But maybe Russians will look back at the Slutsky allegations as the beginning of a change. CNN's Nathan Hodge and Darya Tarasova contributed to this report.",

Barcelona-based newspaper Sport dubbed it: \"The Robbery of the Century.\"It was anger that gripped Gianluigi Buffon -- the Juventus goalkeeper who was very much at the center of the Italian club's dramatic Champions League quarterfinal exit to Real Madrid -- both in the match's final minutes and afterward as he spoke to the media.Follow @cnnsport\n\nBuffon was incensed that English referee Michael Oliver awarded a penalty deep in injury time after Juve defender Medhi Benatia pushed Lucas Vazquez in the box and also appeared to catch the Spaniard with his left leg. Vazquez, seemingly, would have had a clear attempt on goal from five yards if not for the contact.  So, Barcelona-based Sport is being more dramatic about last night's events than Gazzetta is. \"The theft of the century\", really? pic.twitter.com/t2Q2S9ib7j\u2014 Sonja Nikcevic (@sonjanik13) April 12, 2018\n\nThe legendary Italian keeper then saw red for bumping Oliver and ripping into him verbally, with Cristiano Ronaldo keeping his cool amid all the furore to convert the ensuing penalty in the 97th minute and put the twice defending champions through 4-3 on aggregate despite a 3-1 loss on the night at the Bernabeu. READ: Was Ronaldo's overhead kick the best goal ever?Read MoreREAD: Agonizing for Juventus Afterward the 40-year-old World Cup winner -- likely playing in his final Champions League game with retirement on the horizon -- was still fuming. He claimed Oliver crumbled.  \"It was a tenth of a penalty,\" Buffon told Mediaset Premium in quotes carried by the Football Italia website. \"I know the referee saw what he saw, but it was certainly a dubious incident. \"Clearly you cannot have a heart in your chest, but a garbage bin. On top of that, if you don't have the character to walk on a pitch like this in a stadium like this, you can sit in the stands with your wife, your kids, drinking your Sprite and eating crisps.\"You cannot ruin the dreams of a team. I could have told the referee anything at that moment, but he had to understand the degree of the disaster he was creating. If you can't handle the pressure and have the courage to make a decision, then you should just sit in the stands and eat your crisps.\"CNN contacted the Premier League offering Oliver the right of reply to Buffon's comments but it said in an email: \"We won't be putting any comment out on behalf of Michael or the Professional Game Match Officials Limited.\"Buffon confronts referee Michael Oliver.The Juventus players were incensed by Oliver's award of the penalty to Real Madrid.READ: Barcelona stunned by RomaAgnelli irate Juve president Andrea Agnelli was as irate as Buffon, claiming UEFA kept assigning referees who were against Italian sides. He referred to the first leg, too, when the Old Lady's star attacker, Paulo Dybala, was sent off for two yellow cards in a 3-0 defeat in Turin and thus missed the second leg. \"For some reason, the vanity of the refereeing designator is trying to scientifically prove he is unbiased and keeps assigning referees who are against Italian clubs,\" Agnelli, who called for the introduction of video assisted refereeing (VAR) in the Champions League, told Mediaset. \"Players make mistakes, so do referees, but this official completely lost control of the situation, A referee in Madrid for the quarterfinal must have seen the first leg, realize the Dybala red card was excessive and understand the various situations.\"The referee tonight was in total chaos.\"Cristiano Ronaldo of Real Madrid was cool as ice in scoring the key penalty.Later this year VAR will be used at the World Cup for the first time, although in February UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said the system wouldn't be used in next season's Champions League.Funny how twitter can't cope with the Buffon-realities. Yes! We love him. Yes! He is passionate! Yes! He is good -looking! Yes! He deserves a CL-trophy! Yes! He was a \"madman\" after the penalty was given.Yes! Red card correct\u2014 Jan Aage Fjortoft (@JanAageFjortoft) April 12, 2018\n\nAgnelli's comments, in particular, may catch the attention of UEFA. And when contacted by CNN, the governing body said it was \"waiting for the relevant information from our disciplinary department\" to see if any action would be taken against Juventus. Juventus' Serie A rivals, though, might say it is a case of the pot calling the kettle black. Juventus was memorably stripped of two Serie A titles and relegated from the top flight for influencing referees as part of the Calciopoli scandal of 2006, the year Buffon led Italy to World Cup glory over current Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane's France. After Spurs were knocked out by Juve in the last-16, the London club's manager Mauricio Pochettino said the Italian club \"have the habit to win and the habit to put pressure on the referee. It's a club with a culture to try to do everything to help the team.\" Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates the club's progression to the Champions League semis.Cometh a Cristiano Ronaldo goal, cometh an opportunity to showcase his ripped body ...Clear penalty, says RonaldoRonaldo coolly deposited his shot past Buffon's replacement Wojciech Szczesny even after a lengthy wait and the best attempts of Juventus players to put him off prior to the kick.  The Portuguese, who had scored twice -- including a wonder goal -- in the first leg was left in no doubt as to whether it was a penalty. \"I don't understand why they're complaining,\" he said in the mixed zone, according to Football Italia. \"Lucas was tackled from behind and if they don't give him the penalty, it's a goal.\"READ: Ronaldo's 'Playstation goal' is talk of the worldJuventus' near miraculous comeback in the battle of last year's finalists came after Roma overturned a three-goal deficit to eliminate Real Madrid's archrival, Barcelona, on the away-goals rule Tuesday.

ChallengesA few decades ago, the Kenya Rugby Union took the decision to focus efforts on the seven-a-side game. In the 15-a-side format, Kenya was only at a stage to compete against other African nations; with sevens, they had the prospect of competing internationally. At the time, rivals laughed but over the years it's reaped rewards. Since then, the likes of Uganda and Zimbabwe have followed suit and focused their attentions on rugby's shortened format. \"We took that decision and it has paid off,\" Kenya Rugby president Richard Omwela tells CNN. \"We are now able to beat some of the big boys on the global leagues.\"We've ended up playing, for example, New Zealand, who we would never dream of playing in fifteens.\"But despite Shujaa's impressive rise on the world circuit, challenges still remain. Results on the field belie the difference in resources between Kenya and some of its rivals.

We don't have enough of those sorts of resources,\" says Omwela. \"It's difficult for a player to be away for 14 days out in Hong Kong or Singapore -- going to United States one week then Vancouver another. It's hard for employers to keep you in your job if half the time you're never at your place of work. It's very, very challenging for us. \"While, for example, the England players will be in rehab or training and so on, we don't have that luxury. Funding is a major issue.\"As for the players, all they can do is to keep performing and hope their efforts don't get overlooked.\"When we returned from Vancouver, the government took notice of us -- that the boys are playing well and need support,\" says Omwela.\"They're able to send high-level officials to receive the team when they arrive. Sometimes when we don't play well, we don't see them as often when we arrive. We slip in the taxi and continue our training.\"Looking forwards   The Commonwealth Games is a further opportunity for Shujaa to establish themselves as one of the world's top teams and maybe make a piece of national history in the process.As far as Omwela is concerned, he'd be delighted if the team, which has never finished higher than seventh at the Commonwealths, left Australia with a medal of any color.\"Obviously riding on the way we're playing (at the moment) we are hoping for a podium finish,\" he said. \"Not necessarily a gold but even picking up a silver or a bronze would be a big achievement for us. We believe that the players we've got are capable of doing that.\"JUST WATCHEDWhat are the Commonwealth Games?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhat are the Commonwealth Games? 01:23Beyond the immediate focus of the Commonwealth Games, he says he'd like to see his country break into the top four of the Sevens World Series standings -- positions usually occupied by heavyweights New Zealand, Fiji, South Africa and England -- in the next five years. Amonde, who only took up the sport after leaving school when he caught the eye of a local coach for \"looking rugby-like,\" thinks there's still work to be done if Kenya \"really wants to be ranked amongst the best.\"We have to improve the quality of the things we do back home and having the players coming through from an amateur set-up to a professional set-up,\" he says.

Two of the eight left without competing.Team attache Simon Molombe said he did not expect them to return. \"I don't think they will be back,\" Cameroon's Molombe told CNN Sport, confirming their disappearance had been reported to Australian police.

Nobody knows the direction they have gone,\" Cameroon team spokesman Simon Lyonga told CNN affiliate Seven News.According to Seven, the athletes' visa requirements expire on May 15, allowing them to spend another month legally in Australia.David Grevemberg, Commonwealth Games Federation CEO, said the situation remained an issue for the Cameroon team until the athletes breached their visas. \"It is obviously disappointing that some of the athletes who have come didn't compete when scheduled to compete,\" he said at a press conference Wednesday.\"I think it is also important to remember that these athletes are guests here in Australia and are still within their visas and have the right to travel freely.\"Cameroon's Simplice Fotsala (left), pictured during the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games on April 6, is one of the athletes listed as missing.The 2018 Games are currently underway in the Gold Coast in the Australian State of Queensland. They're expected to conclude on Sunday April 15.More than 4,500 athletes from 71 countries will take part during the course of the games, which began on April 5, competing for a total of 275 gold medalsIt is not the first time athletes have disappeared during major sporting events. During the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne 25 competitors went missing, while 26 disappeared during the 2002 Games in Manchester. Olivier Heracles Matam Matam of Cameroon, here competing on April 5, has been listed missing by his team.At London 2012, seven Cameroon athletes disappeared during the Olympics.

Follow @cnnsport\n\nReed still has a way to go in matching Woods' golf feats but in opening his tally at majors by winning the Masters -- the sport's biggest prize -- imagine his delight at being congratulated by his legendary fellow American. \"I got a call from Tiger,\" Reed told CNN's Alex Thomas, understandably still basking in the glory of his Augusta success. Woods wasn't the only one to reach out to the 27-year-old, with major winners Tom Watson, Davis Love, Jim Furyk, Lee Trevino and Bubba Watson also getting in touch. JUST WATCHEDMasters champ Patrick Reed on his 2018 winReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMasters champ Patrick Reed on his 2018 win 04:26READ: Patrick Reed keeps his nerve to claim the Green JacketRead More\"A lot of the guys have been sending a lot of text messages, just lots of support and it just shows how close a group we are on the PGA Tour and we're just one big family out there,\" Reed said.\"Of (course you) want to win, but if someone else does we're there to support him and cheer him along.\"'I'm being treated a little differently' Receiving congratulatory messages might be commonplace for new champions but it's especially noteworthy in Reed's case. He has a reputation for sticking to himself on the tour -- much like Woods did in the early stages of his career.So much so that during the US's disastrous Ryder Cup showing in 2014 one of golf's behemoths, Phil Mickelson, according to Golf World, told Reed as he addressed each of his teammates: \"Patrick, we need to know you better.\"  Doing a host of interviews in the wake of his victory Sunday, people are indeed starting to get to know Reed better. In speaking to CNN, he didn't shy away from questions about his rocky relationship with his own family. They are estranged.  \"I am who I am,\" Reed told CNN Sport's Don Riddell in an interview on Sunday after winning the Masters.\"You know that once you're successful, there's going to be good things and bad things that people say and, honestly, to me it doesn't really matter.\"READ: 'I am who I am' JUST WATCHEDPatrick Reed wins the 82nd MastersReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPatrick Reed wins the 82nd Masters 00:10On a lighter note, his new found fame has already led to some perks, such as taking in an NBA basketball game with wife Justine in the front row at New York's Madison Square Gardens between the New York Knicks and LeBron James' Cleveland Cavaliers. \"I do feel like I'm being treated a little differently,\" Reed said. \"I've never sat courtside before. I look to my left, (actor and comedian) Chris Rock's there. \"I was like: 'What is going on?' Looking to my left, looking to my right, and I'm like ... 'I'm just a golfer.'\"The ovations that the fans gave to all of us and gave myself and everything now that I was in the place, it was awesome. And to see other athletes go out and play, play basketball that close, it was awesome.\"Ryder Cup on his mindSpeaking of awesome, Reed sparkled when the US reclaimed the Ryder Cup from Europe at Hazeltine in Minnesota two years ago, earning an event best 3.5 points and getting the better of Rory McIlroy -- who battled the American hard Sunday, only to slip into a tie for fifth. That duel with the Northern Irishman went down in Ryder Cup folklore, the pair going head-to-head and leading to Reed's memorable finger wagging in McIlroy's direction. Reed is already looking forward to this year's Ryder Cup near Paris in September, a time when he will potentially encounter McIlroy once again. \"I can't wait to come back,\" he said. \"I have some other tricks up my sleeves to get the fans, just to go back and forth with them, because it's such an awesome experience and such a great time to go back overseas.\"Reed gestures to the crowd while holding the Ryder Cup in 2016.Of the last six Masters winners, only one -- Jordan Spieth -- has won a major away from Augusta, while Bubba Watson did add to his haul of majors by claiming a second Masters crown in 2014.  Reed -- whose best finish at a major prior to last weekend was a second-place showing at the PGA Championship last August -- is convinced that he won't be a one-hit wonder. \"I've won the first one, so I know it can be done,\" said Reed. \"It's one thing to believe, it's (another) to go ahead and do it. Once you get in that winning circle, now it's become a reality. You know it can be done.\"I'd be disappointed if this was the only (major).

I feel like the sky is the limit, you just go out there and continue to build it, you know just golf, have a lot of fun and keep giving yourself opportunities on Sunday and if I'm in the mix, I feel like we can do a lot of damage.\"",

Follow @cnnsport\n\nThe Kiwi -- who lived as Gavin Hubbard until 2014 -- looked certain to claim Commonwealth gold in the 90kg+ division at the Gold Coast Games this week, until disaster struck. While her rivals mostly undertook snatch lifts of under 100kg, Hubbard had raised 120kg on her first attempt. With a considerable lead already assured, the 40-year-old promptly stepped it up to 132kg -- enough for a Commonwealth record. It proved too much. Hubbard's arm buckled to the horror of the crowd, leaving her unable to continue in the second aspect of the competition, known as the clean & jerk. Instead Samoa's Feagaiga Stowers won the gold medal, with Charisma Amoe-Tarrant of Nauru and Emily Campbell of England taking silver and bronze respectively. Read MoreYet it is the competitor with \"DNF\" beside her name that has made global headlines.  JUST WATCHEDAthletes take the CNN Commonwealth Games QuizReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAthletes take the CNN Commonwealth Games Quiz 02:12\"I am waiting to see specialists back in New Zealand but it is likely the ruptured ligament in my arm will be career-ending,\" Hubbard said in a statement sent to CNN. \"I have always believed it is not enough just to wear the silver fern and I do not regret pushing myself to try to deliver my best possible performance.\"HistoryHubbard, whose father is a former mayor of Auckland City, would have been the first ever transgender gold medalist in the history of Olympic or Commonwealth competition. Her participation alone elicited mixed responses. Hubbard's first attempt in the snatch was 7kg more than her nearest rival's best attempt. Just last month Australian Weightlifting Federation chief executive Michael Keelan protested against the New Zealander's right to compete, arguing weightlifting has \"always been a gender-specific sport\" -- a stance shared by Samoa's head coach, Jerry Wallwork. \"A man is a man and a woman is a woman, and I know a lot of changes have gone through, but in the past Laurel Hubbard used to be a male champion weightlifter,\" Wallwork told reporters before the competition began Monday.\"The strength is still there and I think it's very unfair, and for all females it's unfair.\"READ: 'Fittest woman on earth' wins gold medal after family tragedy'Fairness, non-discrimination and inclusion'Despite setting national junior records as a male weightlifter, Hubbard isn't breaking any rules. The International Olympic Committee decrees that male-to-female transgender athletes must undergo hormone therapy and demonstrate testosterone levels of below 10 nanomols per liter for at least one year leading up to and during competition. Such athletes must also declare their \"gender identity\" is female for a minimum of four years. She looked set to move into the clean and jerk element of competition with an insurmountable lead......But a ruptured ligament means she will likely never be able to compete again.  Hubbard transitioned in her mid-30s and accordingly does not fall foul of either ruling.  But her compatriot and fellow weightlifter Tracey Lambrechs feels she has had an \"unfair advantage.\" \"I feel there is an unfair advantage even though it is within all the regulations... all I can hope is that they look into it and make a more educated judgment,\" Lambrechs said, in quotes carried by Radio New Zealand. Lambrechs represented New Zealand at the Rio 2016 Olympics, but has reportedly been forced to shed as much as 17kg and drop weight classes to the -90kg division to give way to Hubbard in the higher weight class. \"I am glad that people can come out and live their lives and be happy but when it comes to a professional sporting environment it gets a bit trickier,\" said Lambrechs. \"(She) is lifting a lot more than what the other women are... so personally I do think there is an unfair advantage.\"READ: Caster Semenya cruises to 1500m gold as South African gold rush continuesHubbard became the first Kiwi transgender athlete to win a weightlifting title at the 2017 Australian Open.Hubbard's career trajectory bears witness to the physical benefits she has gained. From barely causing so much as a ripple at the senior international level when competing as a man, the weightlifter took to the podium twice last year in her maiden World Championship as a woman. However it's worth noting that nine countries -- including China and Russia -- were suspended from that 2017 event as the International Weightlifting Federation attempts to resolve an endemic doping culture.Consequently a number of the sport's leading heavyweights, including Russian world record holder Tatiana Kashirina, were absent -- something Hubbard has ascribed to her success.But her achievement remains significant: No Kiwi lifter had ever previously won a World Championship medal in any weight category. READ: Eight Cameroon athletes go missing at Australia's Commonwealth Games'She's human, like the rest of us'In the end American Sarah Robles edged Hubbard to the World Championship gold in Anaheim, California. Robles's coach, Tim Swords, had expressed skepticism ahead of the event, saying: \"I do not want to say anything negative, but in my humble opinion this is not fair.\"Robles herself, though, became one of a growing number that have embraced the transgender weightlifter. \"It was wonderful -- she gave me a big hug and wished me luck for the following day, and I really believe she meant it, too,\" Hubbard told NZ Newswire.\"It's kind of cool when you've got people at that level who are prepared to just focus on themselves and focus on the competition. It takes a certain amount of grace.\"Hubbard poses with her World Championship silver medals in Auckland, New Zealand.Campbell, Commonwealth bronze medalist in Hubbard's division, was similarly supportive this week. \"She just wants to lift. That's all she wants to do, come out and lift, have a good time and enjoy doing what we love to do,\" the English weightlifter told reporters.\"People shouldn't be making comments and making her feel horrible for doing something she loves to do.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news and features\"She's human, like the rest of us. It doesn't always go right, doesn't always go to plan.\"I just hope they're mindful of how she feels. She's a person.\"",

Plumes rise silently and menacingly over the hilly horizon, slowly blotting out the sun as the sky turns black. The fields are on fire again. Follow @cnnsport\n\nAnd looking out onto the scene is a small child in a small house, waiting for her parents to come home. This is how life started for Mary Kom, the five-time world amateur boxing champion who will face Northern Ireland's Kristina O'Hara in the Commonwealth Games' 48kg final on Sunday.  India's Mary Kom (blue) defeats Sri Lanka's Anusha Dilrukshi Koddithuwakku at the Commonwealth Games. The 35-year-old Indian superstar grew up in the small village of Kangathei in Manipur, described as a poor state in north-east India that borders Myanmar. Her family worked in the jhum fields as tenant farmers to bring in what little wages they could to support their family. It was labor intensive work in a state where the slash and burn form of agriculture is still practiced. Read MoreThe hardship of life in Manipur and the poverty of the region stirred an ambition in Kom, who wanted something better out of life.She had a natural ability in boxing -- taking after her father who was a fine wrestler -- and soon became state champion with the nickname \"Magnificent Mary.\" Five world championships and an Olympic bronze medal later, Kom now has enough money to support her family and has become not only a hero in her village but in the entire country of 1.3 billion people where female sporting superstars are rare. She is approaching 1 million followers on Twitter.   Kom celebrates after winning her semifinal boxing match during the Commonwealth Games.An inspiration Kom is indeed seen as an inspiration to female athletes and women in general across India, pushing the boundaries of what sportswomen can achieve -- especially when she came back to the ring after getting married and having three children. Kom even carried the Queen's baton at the 2010 Delhi Commonwealth Games despite women's boxing not being an event that year, an indication of just how much her country loves and respects her.She is seen as a true sporting legend and is now a member of the Rajya Sabha -- the upper house of India's parliament -- and has opened up her own gym to inspire the next generation of India's boxers. It is a true story of rags to riches and would make for an amazing Hollywood -- or rather Bollywood -- script. Unsurprisingly, the movie studios agreed and \"Mary Kom\"  the film was released in 2014 with Bollywood giant and Quantico star Priyanka Chopra -- she has 22.4 million followers on Twitter -- playing Kom in the lead role. But whether there will be a happy ending on the Gold Coast for India's golden girl on her Games debut remains to be seen. Kom also has her sights on the women's world championships in Delhi later this year.  Bollywood actress Priyanka Chopra played Mary Kom in the film adaptaion of the boxer's life.

        "content": "(CNN)Wayde van Niekerk might not be competing in this year's Commonwealth Games due to injury, but South Africa are managing pretty well on the track without him. After Akani Simbine and Henricho Bruintjies stormed to a one-two finish ahead of favorite Yohan Blake in the men's 100-meter final on Monday, Tuesday saw double Olympic champion Caster Semenya cruise to gold in the women's 1500m. The 27-year-old obliterated the field, setting a personal best and Commonwealth Games record of 4.00.71 in the process, in another landmark race for her already glittering career.Having won 800m gold at both the London and Rio Olympics, the 1500m is a relatively new race for her and victory will be a huge encouragement ahead of her 800m final on Friday, with her sights set on a world record that has stood for 35 years. The 27-year-old Semenya was in imperious form on the track.Semenya, who carried the flag for South Africa at the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony, is hyperandrogenous -- meaning she has elevated testosterone levels -- and the condition has dogged her athletics career ever since she won the world 800m title as an 18-year-old in 2009.Read More\"It's not about looking at people [and] how they look, how they speak, how they run,\" Semenya recently told the Sydney Morning Herald.\"You know, it's not about being muscular. It's about sports,\" she said. \"When you walk out of your apartment, you think about performing. You don't think about how your opponents look. You just want to do better.\"Semenya celebrates as she crosses the finish line almost three seconds ahead of her opponents in the Carrara Stadium, Gold Coast in the 1500m final.Kenya's Beatrice Chepkoech finished almost three seconds behind Semenya to take silver, while Welsh runner Melissa Courtney took bronze. Semenya's gold takes South Africa ahead of Canada in the overall medal table, into fifth place behind Australia, England, India and New Zealand. South Africa's Caster Semenya celebrates her commanding victory in the women's 1500m final.Cool rollingsFor a small Caribbean island, Jamaica has had its fair share of international sporting success -- and not just on the track. It has also been a nation attracted to the most unlikely of sports. Just think of the famous \"Cool Runnings\" bobsled team of the 1988 Winter Olympics.Jamaica's Andrew Newell and Melvyn Edwards compete for Jamaica in the lawn bowls.Now Jamaica has found a new hero in a sport more closely associated with rainy Britain than the soft white sands of the Caribbean island: lawn bowler Andrew Newell.One of the so-called \"Reggae Rollers,\" Newell sprung one of the biggest shocks of the Games when he defeated English world No. 3 and gold medal favorite Robert Paxton 21-16 in round three of the men's singles lawn bowls. Jamaica did not have a single bowls lawn until 2015.After suffering brutal defeat in his first two matches -- 21-0 and 21-2 -- the victory over Paxton then spurred Newell onto a second success, this time over India's Krishna Xalxo, meaning a win in his final group tie tomorrow could see the 44-year-old progress to the quarterfinals.Fast-becoming one of the cult heroes of the Games, Newell has even been stopped for a photograph in the athletes' village by former Olympic champion Yohan Blake.JUST WATCHEDAthletes take the CNN Commonwealth Games QuizReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAthletes take the CNN Commonwealth Games Quiz 02:12Unticked boxIt is universally accepted fact of life that nobody enjoys doing their admin.

Nigeria topped the podium in all four para powerlifting events on the Gold Coast on Tuesday -- with Roland Ezuruike, Esther Oyema, Ndidi Nwosu and Abdulazeez Ibrahim all claiming gold in their divisions, not to mention an additional two silver medals for the African nation.

Malawi overcome Scotland in netball thrillerThe Malawi netball team celebrate a climactic victory over Scotland on the Gold Coast.In a Commonwealth Games packed with more than a few fairytale stories, the Malawian netball team is starting to stand out as a real Cinderella story.Having not won a single Commonwealth medal since 1986, the African nation clung on in a heart-pounding climax to defeat Scotland 51-50 to keep their hopes of a semifinal berth alive. After leading 51-49 with 27 seconds on the clock, the Scots pulled the score to 51-50 before Malawi's Jane Chimaliro was sent off for time wasting.Scotland's goal attack Lynsey Gallagher then missed both shots, giving Malawi a thrilling victory that went down to the last throw of the game.

        "content": "London (CNN)British royal weddings are usually grand affairs of state, where presidents and prime ministers rub shoulders with obscure European monarchs. Not so, the nuptials of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.Kensington Palace announced on Tuesday that the royal couple would not be inviting political leaders to the event, at least not on the basis of their official position. Which means neither US President Donald Trump nor his predecessor Barack Obama will be there. Not even British Prime Minister Theresa May was deemed worthy of a place on the guest list.Instead, only personal friends of the couple will be inside Windsor Castle for the royal event of the year on May 19.\"It has been decided that an official list of political leaders -- both UK and international -- is not required for Prince Harry and Ms. Markle's wedding,\" a Kensington Palace spokesman said. \"Her Majesty's Government was consulted on this decision, which was taken by the royal household.\"A White House official confirmed neither Trump nor first lady Melania were invited; nor was Prime Minister May, Downing Street said.\n\n\n\n\nRead MoreA royal source said that while Harry and Meghan hoped to see Barack and Michelle Obama soon, the former US President and his wife would not be at the wedding. The source would not say definitively whether the Obamas -- who are close to the royal couple --  had been invited. Unlike the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011, this royal wedding is not an official state occasion and is regarded as a private ceremony, so there is no onus on the couple to invite political leaders.CNN understands that some world leaders may be invited on the basis of their personal relationships with Harry and Meghan.The ceremony, which will take place in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, is being held in a much smaller venue than Westminster Abbey, where Harry's older brother, Prince William, married Kate Middleton. Around 1,900 people attended the ceremony in 2011, while the chapel hosting the wedding in May has a capacity of just 800.Related: Your questions about the Royal wedding, answeredA number of heads of state were present at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011. Markle has called Trump 'divisive' and 'misogynistic'Rumors about the guest list -- specifically the inclusion or not of the Obamas and President Trump -- have been swirling for months. Will Meghan Markle become the royal family's silent feminist?While Prince Harry, who is obliged as a royal to be politically neutral, has never spoken publicly about Trump, Markle strongly criticized the now president in 2016.In an interview on The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore in May that year, two months before Harry and Meghan first met, she described Trump (who was then a Republican candidate for the presidency) as \"divisive\" and \"misogynistic.\"There had been speculation in the UK media that British officials feared the political consequences if the couple decide to invite Barack and Michelle Obama, with whom they are friends, but not Donald Trump.Harry has become close to the Obamas through their support for the Invictus Games, an event for injured servicemen and women that was started by the UK royal in 2014.Barack Obama and Prince Harry were spotted together at the Invictus Games in Toronto last year.He recently interviewed the former president on BBC radio and the pair were previously involved in a light-hearted social media war after the Obamas made a viral video challenging Harry to \"bring it\" at the Invictus Games in 2016.Guest lists have been problematic for many royal couples in the past. The royal family was accused of favoring the UK Conservative Party over Labour when former Conservative Prime Ministers John Major and Margaret Thatcher received invitations to Prince William's wedding, while Labour leaders Tony Blair and Gordon Brown did not. On that occasion, Buckingham Palace responded that Major was invited in his role as former guardian of William and Harry when their mother Diana died in 1997, not for his status as a former prime minister.Public invited inside castle groundsKensington Palace has also released some of the names of the 2,640 people who will be invited into the grounds of Windsor Castle on May 19 to watch the newlyweds depart from the castle on a carriage procession through the town of Windsor.The invitees come from across the UK and include charity workers, injured servicemen and young community leaders, according to a statement published Tuesday.Seven recipients of The Diana Award, which recognizes youth who are working to change the world in the memory of William and Harry's mother Princess Diana, are also among those invited, according to a press release. Invitees include an east London teenager working to prevent knife crime, a Birmingham teen tackling racism and mental health issues in her community, and anti-bullying activists. They will join 500 members of the Royal Household and 100 pupils from two local schools who are also being welcomed into the castle grounds.",

It detailed Reed's estrangement from his parents and younger sister, while also resurfacing allegations of cheating made by college teammates in Shane Ryan's book Slaying the Tiger.Reed denies that he cheated.There's also the underage drinking and possession of a fake ID in Reed's first year at the University of Georgia, for which the freshman was fined and sentenced to 60 hours of community service. Reed also drew the ire of the golf world when he claimed he was \"a top five player\" after winning just his third PGA Tour title back in 2014.Patrick Reed  is awarded the Green Jacket by 2017 winner Sergio Garcia of Spain after winning the Masters at Augusta.The new Masters champion stressed that he's very comfortable about his past and current career -- and his past and current life.\"Honestly, I don't ever regret anything I say,\" Reed told reporters. \"I stand by my comments.\" \"I've evolved into childhood; childhood into high school; high school into college; college into professional golf,\" he elaborated when talking to CNN. \"They're just chapters in my life.\"Asked by a reporter why some fans root against him, Reed replied: \"I don't know. \"Why don't you ask them?

Every young golfer dreams of one day winning the Masters and Reed was no different, taking to the putting green in his youth, saying \"this putt's to win the green jacket\" or \"I've got to get up and down to win the green jacket.\"No wonder he described Sunday's result as \"a dream come true.\"JUST WATCHEDJavier Ballesteros on his father SeveReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHJavier Ballesteros on his father Seve 05:46\"I really haven't come off cloud nine yet,\"  said Reed. \"To actually finally be sitting down and have my first major be the green jacket, and to be able to sit here wearing it, it's a surreal moment for me and it's something that I'll never forget. \"It kind of makes me hungry to get back out there and try to win some more...\"There's certainly no glass ceiling to the American's ambitions. \"I feel like I played the golf that I need to play in order to get to where I want to be, and that's to be the best golfer in the world,\" he said after moving up to No. 11 in the world rankings.\"The way you're going to do that is perform in these big events and to win these big events.\"Reed gestures to the crowd while holding the Ryder Cup in 2016.It took Reed until the 2017 PGA Championship to even secure a top-10 finish at a major -- something he put down to putting \"too much pressure\" on himself. This week was different. Gone was the fixation with hitting \"the perfect shots.\" Instead, Reed just went out there and played. \"I had my caddy remind me of that the entire week,\" he reflected. \"Just be you.  Play golf.  If you get riled up, show it.  If you aren't happy about something, it's all right. Just play golf.\"He certainly did that.",

Better known for its pine trees than its international athletes, the Australian territory had only won one Commonwealth medal in its history, but the Norfolk Islanders now have another medal to treasure after a trio of lawn bowlers sprung shock defeats against England and Canada to take a historic bronze. The team members make for quite a combination -- a 55-year-old farmer, a 39-year-old musician and a a 62-year-old taxi driver -- all coming together at the island's only bowls club. The trio came from behind late in the bronze medal match to defeat Canada -- a comparative sporting giant -- 19-16 to claim the island's first medal in 24 years and match compatriot Carmen Anderson's feat of bronze in the lawn bowls at the 1994 Games.One team member, Haydn 'Teddy' Evans, told The Telegraph how much the victory would mean to the islanders: \"So many people don't know anything about Norfolk Island so this is just one little way of helping,\" he said.\"We owe it to those people for supporting us so well.

        "content": "(CNN)Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's decisive victory in parliamentary elections will likely give him sweeping powers to reshape the country and ring alarm bells in other European Union capitals.With 98% of the vote counted by Monday, the coalition led by Orban's ruling party, Fidesz, was projected to win 133 seats out of the 199 seats in Parliament, according to the country's National Election Office. The result would grant Orban's government a \"supermajority,\" giving it the power to amend the constitution.The Fidesz-led coalition took 49% of the national list votes, trouncing the liberal opposition, which had failed to put up a united front.Orban greets supporters in Budapest on Sunday.Orban, who won his fourth term on a virulently anti-immigration platform, was already Hungary's longest-serving leader since the fall of communism in 1989. He has transformed Fidesz beyond recognition: formed as a liberal party in the 1980s, it is now a firmly right-wing nationalist movement.Buoyed by a strong economy, Orban was always expected to win, but the strong backing for his euroskeptic and anti-immigration platofrm represents a headache for the European Union.Read MoreThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Security in Europe issued a highly critical statement of the election campaign Monday, singling out \"a pervasive overlap between state and ruling party resources, undermining contestants' ability to compete on an equal basis\" as well as \"intimidating and xenophobic rhetoric, media bias and opaque campaign financing.\"That \"constricted the space for genuine political debate, hindering voters' ability to make a fully informed choice,\" the OSCE said. Right-wing leaders in Europe were quick to congratulate Orban. Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, Hungary's closest ally in the EU, tweeted: \"The road to reform is never easy,\" adding that \"the support of the majority of society shows that it's worth making the effort.\" French far-right politician Marine Le Pen, described the result on Twitter as a  \"great and clear victory\" and said that \"nationalists could soon be in the majority in Europe.\"The Jobbik party, a far-right group that has tried to tame its image over recent years and rebrand itself as an anti-corruption force, came a distant second. It received 19.2% of the votes, the National Election Office said. The party's disappointing performance prompted party president Gabor Vona to announce his resignation.Long lines were reported at polling stations across the country. Fidesz, in a coalition with the smaller Christian Democratic People's Party, has held a two-thirds supermajority in Parliament for the past eight years, allowing it to change the constitution without a referendum.The coalition has passed a slew of laws tightening regulations on the media, central bank, constitutional court and nongovernmental organizations. European Union leaders have warned those laws would undermine the country's democracy. State media in Hungary is widely supportive of Oban and opposition voices were sidelined in the runup to Sunday's election.The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe will present a report on the election at 3 p.m. local time that is expected to be critical of aspects of the election. A government billboard on Budapest's outskirts calling for an end to migration. Orban is a critic of the European Commission -- the executive arm of the EU -- despite Hungary's status as one of the largest recipients of EU development funds. Orban has accused the Commission of overreach in Hungary's affairs, particularly in its attempt to impose a quota system that would have obliged Hungary to settle refugees.The Hungarian government has set up anti-immigration billboards across the country, though it has the third-lowest level of immigration of the EU's 28 countries.Orban has sought to portray himself as a defender of Christian Europe against Islamic immigration. He has also railed against what he refers to as meddlesome international institutions, such as the United Nations and NGOs.  Fidesz also ran an aggressive campaign against the Hungarian-born Jewish financier and philanthropist George Soros, accusing him of plotting to take control of the country. The anti-Soros rhetoric came against a wider backdrop of antisemitism in Hungary.CNN's Angela Dewan and Hande Atay Alam contributed to this report.",

Transgender weightlifter Laurel Hubbard departed the Carrara Sports Arena with a heavily bandaged elbow, ligaments likely ruptured, and hopes of becoming the first transgender athlete to win Commonwealth gold ruined. Follow @cnnsport\n\nAfter much discourse and calls for her to be banned, Hubbard stepped onto the dice Monday as favorite for gold in the women's 90kg-plus category. Having shunned the pre-competition spotlight -- the New Zealander arrived on the Gold Coast later than the rest of her teammates -- the focus was very much on the 40-year-old who has split opinion in recent months. She leaves the Gold Coast without a medal, but has still made her mark by becoming the first transgender athlete to compete at the Commonwealth Games.

I'm sure that will come with time,\" Hubbard told reporters, adding that she had \"no regrets\" about the record-breaking attempt. \"At this stage we don't know the exact details of the injury. \"It seems likely that I have ruptured a ligament, some insignificant tissue damage. But until we have further scanning we won't know the details.\"... Hubbard injured her arm trying to lift 132kg.'A woman is a woman'After undergoing 12 months of hormone therapy and recording low levels of testosterone, Hubbard -- who lived as Gavin Hubbard until 2014 -- was cleared to compete as a woman by the International Olympic Committee last year. There had been much debate over whether the two-time world silver medalist should have been allowed to participate, with critics claiming an athlete who had previously represented her country as a man had an unfair advantage.Her participation at the Commonwealth Games as a transgender athlete has split opinion.Only last month Australian Weightlifting Federation chief executive Michael Keelan protested against the New Zealander's right to compete, while Samoa's head coach Jerry Wallwork has also voiced his opposition. \"A man is a man and a woman is a woman and I know a lot of changes have gone through, but in the past Laurel Hubbard used to be a male champion weightlifter,\" he told reporters before the competition began Monday.\"The strength is still there and I think it's very unfair, and for all females it's unfair.\"Standing at 185 cm and weighing 130kg, Hubbard was the tallest and heaviest athlete in the field. She was also the overwhelming favorite. England's Emily Campbell is one weightlifter who has backed Hubbard.While some of her fellow weightlifters have declined to comment during the Games, England's Emily Campbell --who competed against Hubbard in the 90kg+ category -- was supportive of her rival. \"She just wants to lift. That's all she wants to do, come out and lift, have a good time and enjoy doing what we love to do,\" the English weightlifter told reporters after winning bronze. \"People shouldn't be making comments and making her feel horrible for doing something she loves to do.\"She's human, like the rest of us. It doesn't always go right, doesn't always go to plan.\"I just hope they're mindful of how she feels. She's a person.\"Silver medallist Charisma Amoe-Tarrant of Nauru, gold medallist Feagaiga Stowers of Samoa and bronze medallist Emily Campbell of England pose on the podium for the women's 90/+90kg weightlifting final at the Commonwealth Games.'The crowd were magnificent'Described as an \"introverted character\" by New Zealand's weightlifting high performance director Simon Kent, Hubbard admitted she had worried about the crowd's reaction prior to competition. While the spectators naturally reserved their loudest cheers for home favorite Deb Lovely-Acason, Hubbard's first appearance on the stage was warmly applauded. \"The crowd was absolutely magnificent,\" said Hubbard. \"It felt just like a big embrace. \"I wanted to give them something that was the best I could do. My only real regret was that I was unable to show that.\"Look, it would be untrue to say that the thought never crossed my mind. But there's no indication at all that they were anything other than absolutely fantastic. \"A real credit to the Australian people and also the broader sporting community.\"JUST WATCHEDAthletes take the CNN Commonwealth Games QuizReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAthletes take the CNN Commonwealth Games Quiz 02:12Just months after Adam Rippon became the first openly gay American man to win a medal at the Winter Olympics and snowboarder Gus Kenworthy shared a kiss with his boyfriend live on national television in Pyeongchang, gold for Hubbard would have been another momentous moment for the LGBT community at a major international sporting event. While Hubbard's afternoon did not go to script, history was still made and discussions will continue. \"I think you have to be true to yourself and I hope in this case that's what I've done,\" Hubbard added.

        "content": "Story highlightsRossi accuses Marquez of 'destroying our sport'Rossi crashed out in Argentina after on-track collision (CNN)The largely dormant but always potentially volcanic feud between Valentino Rossi and Marc Marquez erupted violently on Sunday, at an incendiary Argentine MotoGP.Marquez, who had fought his way back through the field from 19th place after a ride-through penalty, appeared to mount a wildly misjudged attempt to pass his rival. Follow @cnnsport\n\nThe Catalan's Repsol Honda collided with Rossi's Movistar Yamaha, shoving the Italian to the edge of the track and onto the wet grass run-off area.To audible gasps from the stands, Rossi was sent sprawling.  He remounted only to limp home in 19th place and out of the points. Marquez crossed the line in fifth, but a penalty for 'reckless riding' pushed him back to 18th, also pointless.Valentino Rossi was left furious after being forced off the track by rival Marc Maequez.Rossi was damning in his assessment of both the incident and Marquez's race weekend overall, pointing to other incidents involving the Honda rider.Read More\"One incident can happen to anybody, you can make a mistake in braking, you can touch the other guy. It can happen, it's racing,\" he told reporters. \"But from Friday morning on, Marquez did this to [Maverick] Vi\u00f1ales, to [Andrea] Dovizioso, to me and today he went straight through four riders.\"READ: Sebastian Vettel wins Bahrain Grand Prix after mechanic hit by Ferrari carREAD: The F1 star who still drives a VW GolfHis penalty following the clash with Rossi was the third for Marquez on a frenetic afternoon.After stalling his bike on the grid there appeared to be confusion over whether he should start from the pit lane. But Marquez mistakenly remained on the grid, storming to a commanding lead after robustly passing even his teammate Dani Pedrosa, who was also then sent dramatically tumbling by an overly-aggressive pass from Tech 3 Yamaha's Johann Zarco.A ride-through penalty for Marquez's starting grid infraction was the beginning of his problems as he fought to regain places.  Valentino Rossi is helped back onto his bike after crashing out.A first misjudged pass attempt saw him barge into Aprilia's Aleix Espargaro, for which race direction ordered him to drop a place, all before the calamitous incident with Rossi.Marquez tried to explain himself after the race. \"[After the ride-through penalty] I obviously tried to push to recover and, unfortunately, I made some mistakes, the biggest one I believe being with Aleix [Espargaro],\" he told reporters. \"I approached faster than him and I didn't realize it. I tried my best to avoid contact but unfortunately I wasn't able.\" The world champion blamed the track for his clash with Rossi. \"With Valentino it was different, as it was a consequence of the track conditions,\" he said. \"I touched a wet patch, locked the front, and released the brakes. I tried to turn, again making my best effort to avoid contact.\"'Disrespect'Even without the drama of the Rossi-Marquez clash, the race was memorable enough. Cal Crutchlow became the first British rider to lead the championship since the legendary Barry Sheene in 1979, with a superbly judged win in capricious conditions.The LCR Honda rider patiently tracked an unlikely leading group containing Zarco, Suzuki's Alex Rins and Pramac Ducati's Jack Miller, before launching a perfectly timed last lap bid for victory.Crutchlow looks to have found his perfect ride this season. \"She's a rocket when she needs to get going,\" he said of his bike. \"Now we come away from here leading the championship and we have to be positive going on to [the next race in] Austin.\"Brit Cal Crutchlow was victorious in Argentina but less than happy with the lack of media attention.The Manxman, never less than direct, voiced his irritation at the sparsely attended post-race press conference, accusing those media not present of 'disrespect'. His frustration was understandable, but the story was undeniably elsewhere.\"Of course, today I made some mistakes, which I recognize,\" Marquez conceded. \"But one thing I know for sure: never in my career have I intentionally hit another rider.\"Yamaha team principal Lin Jarvis was hearing nothing of Marquez's explanation.  \"It was unacceptable, dangerous and deserves a very strong penalty,\" he told MotoGP.com after the race.Rossi went further still. \"He doesn't play clean. He plays dirty,\" he railed. \"They [Race Direction] have to do something; I'm scared on the track when I'm with Marquez. \"I was scared today when I saw his name on the board. I'm not Race Direction -- they will decide -- but like this he is destroying our sport, because when you do 300 km an hour on the track, you have to have respect for your rivals.\"At the end of the race an ashen-faced Marquez, helmet off, walked straight to Rossi's garage to apologize, but was angrily turned away by the Italian's entourage. It is hard to imagine what it would take now to repair their once-cordial relationship.",

        "content": "Muenster (CNN)A man who drove a van into a crowd of people killing two and injuring 20 Saturday in Germany acted alone, according to police.However, investigators told a news conference it's too early to say what motivated the driver, who has not been named, to plow his vehicle into a restaurant's open terrace in the western German city of Muenster before shooting and killing himself.German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer at the conference Sunday said the man could have been mentally ill, though he told reporters authorities are \"investigating in all directions.\" The attack happened about 3:30 p.m. in the old part of Muenster, an area popular on weekends. It was a warm sunny afternoon, one of the first nice days of spring, and many people were outside enjoying the good weather when the crash occurred, said Julian Reichelt, the editor of the popular German tabloid BILD.The timing of Saturday's incident prompted speculation about the driver's motives. It occurred on the one-year anniversary of an attack in Stockholm, Sweden, in which a man drove stolen beer truck into a crowd of pedestrians, killing five. That suspect later admitted to carrying out a \"terrorist crime.\"Firefighters walk through downtown Muenster, Germany, on Saturday after a vehicle drove into a crowd. Read MoreHerbert Reul, the minister for internal affairs in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia -- where Muenster is located -- said there was no known connection to radical Islam in Saturday's crash, but noted that investigators are still combing through the man's background.The driver had a history of petty crime, Muenster police spokesman Rolf Werenbeck-Ueding told CNN.Vehicles as weapons: Muenster part of a deadly trendPolice had said they are investigating witness reports of people fleeing out of the van after the attack. Spokesman Jochan Laschki said the driver had no accomplices, and the investigation is ongoing. Muenster, with about 300,000 people, is home to numerous universities and has a student population of about 58,000, the city government says. The city calls itself the cycling capital of Germany and says about 100,000 residents use a bike daily.CNN's Anna-Maja Rappard, Jason Hanna, Dakin Andone and Susannah Cullinane contributed to this report.",

Polls showed Fidesz far ahead of the main opposition far-right party Jobbik, which has in recent years sought to moderate its policies and image to differentiate itself from Fidesz as it moved to the right. One of Jobbik's leaders, Marton Gyongyosi, told CNN that while Hungary must work with the EU to solve the migrant crisis, his party was still against migration and preferred to focus on policies to keep would-be migrants in their home countries.Gyongyosi infamously called for the government to keep lists of the Jewish Hungarians considered a security risk, as anti-Semitism in the country appears to be on the rise. He later apologized for the comments.Hungary is starting to look a bit like Russia. Here's whyOrban's spokesman, Zoltan Kovacs, also told CNN that besides migration of other EU citizens -- which Hungary is obliged to accommodate -- Fidesz was opposed to other migrants, including refugees. He singled out Muslim migrants as problematic. \"We have been living next to Islam for hundreds of years, since the Middle Ages until the 19th century, and we've learned a lesson from that,\" he said. \"The lesson is, it's impossible to integrate a different culture, not because it's inferior or superior, but simply because the rules are different.\"With little chance of defeating Fidesz, some opposition parties have united to improve their chances of ousting the ruling party from certain seats. Leader of the fringe party Momentum, Andras Fekete-Gyor, said he had pulled out of the race in his central Budapest constituency to give another candidate a better chance of winning, in what he said was heavily gerrymandered city. \"There is a suffocating atmosphere in Hungary. The media is state controlled and reports propaganda -- it's functioning like in communist times. The government is using fear, fear of migrants for example, to get votes,\" Fekete-Gyor said.",

On a night of mixed emotions, Australia's Tia-Clair Toomey dedicated her weightlifting medal to her cousin Jade Dixson who died only two weeks ago.Remembered by Toomey as a \"kind and genuine\" person, Dixson would have been at the Carrara Sport and Leisure Centre to watch her older cousin win her first major weightlifting title had the car she was a passenger in not crashed into a tree and killed her.It's been an emotional few weeks for Toomey following the death of her beloved cousin, who died in a car accident only two weeks ago. \"I just really hope that she's proud of me,\" said the 24-year-old, talking outside the athletes' village before a horseshoe of journalist less than 24 hours after her golden victory.

Only 1kg -- the weight of a bottle of wine -- separated the pair.Toomey roared and flexed her muscles. The tears would come later. Toomey defeated the favorite for the competition by just 1kg -- the weight of a bottle of wine -- to take home the gold. The Commonwealth champion learned of her cousin's death just over a week before she was set to step onto the dice and into the spotlight. She continued to train as she always does, with \"focus, determination and drive,\" deciding not to stray from the original plan of not seeing family until competition was completed.\"I was here and had a job to do,\" the Australian, the focus of much media attention since her victory, said. \"As much as Jade was on my mind and the emotion was rolling, I needed to still stay focused, to represent Australia to the best of my ability. \"I made the decision not to see family prior to the Games so I'm solely focused on the Games. \"As soon as I saw my uncle and auntie, mum and dad, the emotions just hit hard after I got off the dice.\"It was hard, but what I'm going through is nothing compared to what my uncle and aunty are going through.\"Toomey  celebrates with family and friends after winning the gold medal.She has now decided to leave the athletes' village for a few days and will attend Jade's funeral on Monday.

READ: From the court room to the Gold Coast -- How Scottish athlete turned life around to become country's first female boxer'Weightlifting was not my forte'Toomey dedicated her gold medal to her much-loved cousin Jade. A keen runner, Toomey took up CrossFit in 2013 to improve her athletics.CrossFit, a form of fitness training designed to build strength and increase endurance, has become an international sports competition. Founded in 1995, CrossFit consists of training against the clock or against a given task. Participants do not know what exercises they will have to do -- be it squats, indoor rowing, weightlifting, burpees, box jumps, push ups -- so those either training or competing must prepare for every eventuality.

I was only really familiar with the squat, the deadlift and press -- your traditional gym movements.\"The Queenslander, who owns a gym with her husband, Shane, was approached by weightlifting coach Miles Wydal after he had seen her lift a then personal best of 30kg in the clean and jerk at a CrossFit competition. Toomey adds the Commonwealth title to the CrossFit games title she won in 2017 where she was crowned the 'fittest woman on the planet.'Realizing the Australian had potential, Wydal told Toomey and her husband that she should set her sights on representing Australia in weightlifting at the Rio Olympics and the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games. \"That's when my world changed from there,\" she said.\"I suppose he made us believe in ourselves a bit more and he made us open our eyes into potentially what could happen. \"When he told us I could potentially make Rio and the Commonwealth Games I thought 'oh my god, is this guy for real?' \"But I felt, if he can believe in me, surely I should be able to believe in myself.\"CrossFit can be brutal. It's aerobic, anaerobic; muscle-burning, sometimes stomach-churning. Toomey finished runner-up in the CrossFit Games in 2015 and 2016 before winning the title last year to be crowned the \"fittest woman on earth.\"JUST WATCHEDInside CrossFit's secret gymReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHInside CrossFit's secret gym 01:44The sport compliments weightlifting, said Toomey, as it not only helps with technique but also makes her fitter. Training to become not only the \"fittest women on earth\" but also a Commonwealth champion is relentless. She will start at the crack of dawn either at the track, in the pool or on a bike, making the most of her country's beautiful weather. But hours of her day are spent in the gym, instructing classes in the morning and training in the afternoon, though she never regards it as a chore. \"If someone was going to take their time to put the effort into me and believe in me to get that far, giving up my time to train was nothing compared to what Miles had put in for Shane and I,\" she said. \"Shane took it to another level and was educating himself from the internet and everything like that. When he was sacrificing and putting in so much energy that made me more motivated.\"Toomey will now return to CrossFit competition with the aim of defending her title. Tokyo 2020 is on her radar, too. But, as she has learned only too painfully in recent weeks, life is too short to take anything for granted. \"I don't try to think too far ahead,\" she said. \"I focus on the here and now.\"",

The 18-year-old was ordered to serve 200 hours of community service and 18 months of supervision. Follow @cnnsport\n\nSince then, the teenager, known for her power in the ring, has thrown herself into the sport she loves -- as well as mowed some lawns and painted houses along the way -- to make history as her country's first female boxing representative to the games, the multisport event for members of the Commonwealth underway through April 15 in the Australian state of Queensland.

With Proscovia and her teammates, Uganda fielded a netball team for the first time at the games.And Saturday, the She Cranes made history all over again by defeating Malawi 54-52.

After a disappointing individual event where neither won a medal, triathlete brothers Alistair and Jonny Brownlee, who have dominated the sport over the past few years, bounced back with an impressive performance in the mixed triathlon relay to win silver for England.The mixed event consists of nation teams of four -- two women and two men -- who each have to complete a 300-meter swim, 7.5-kilometer cycle and 1.5-kilometer run before handing over to a teammate.Alongside the Brownlees, Jess Learmonth and Vicky Holland made up the English team, which finished second behind host nation Australia.How viral moment redefined the Brownlee brothersWorld record for Scotland Scotland's Neil Fachie, right, and pilot Matt Rotherham celebrate their world record.There was a lot of excitement in cycling Saturday as Scotland's Neil Fachie and pilot Matt Rotherham broke a world record, completing 1,000 meters in 9.568 seconds in the qualifying round of the men's blind and visually impaired sprint. The team went on to win the gold medal, its second of the games so far.Upsets galoreBill Chaffey of Australia loses part of his handle after a crash into a barricade Saturday.There was a huge upset in the paratriathlon as five-time world champion Bill Chaffey of Australia crashed into a barricade, breaking his hand cycle in bits.

There was another big upset for the Aussies in cycling as Matt Glaetzer, the world champion of the men's sprint who set a world record in qualifying, was knocked out by Malaysia's Muhammad Shah Firdaus Sahrom. Malaysia had a knack for upsets Saturday as countryman Nafiizwan Adnan defeated top seed and two-time Commonwealth champion Nick Matthew of England in the men's squash quarterfinals in an incredible game that finished 11-7, 6-11, 12-10, 4-11, 11-6.

The news comes a day after Skripal's daughter Yulia, 33, who was also poisoned in the attack, released her first public statement after regaining consciousness last week. She thanked those who had treated her and her father and all those who had sent \"messages of goodwill.\"Sergei Skripal's cat and guinea pigs are dead, UK says\"As Yulia herself says, her strength is growing daily and she can look forward to the day when she is well enough to leave the hospital,\" Blanshard said Friday.

The UK and its allies have expelled scores of Russian diplomats, triggering retaliatory expulsions by Russia.At the United Nations Security Council meeting on Thursday, Vassily Nebenzia, Russia's UN envoy, called the allegations of Russian culpability a \"fake story\" and said the UK was \"playing with fire and they will be sorry.\"The British government insists that only Russia had the capability to carry out the attack.The UK Foreign Office said Thursday that Yulia Skripal has so far declined the Russian Embassy's offer of consular assistance following the attack. The Russian Embassy has repeatedly said it requested consular access to Yulia and Sergei Skripal, but that it had been \"denied.\"",

The driver was a German citizen, said Herbert Reul, state minister for internal affairs in North Rhine-Westphalia state.Authorities are treating the incident as an attack. There is no known connection to radical Islam but investigators are still looking into the driver's background, Reul said.Police earlier said there were three deaths. Reul clarified later Saturday that the total included the attacker.Muenster police spokesman Andreas Bode said law enforcement is looking into witness reports that some people fled the attacker's van after the attack. He also said there was a suspicious object in the vehicle that was under investigation.Read MoreBode said the motive of the driver is unknown. The attack happened in the old part of the western German city, an area popular on weekends.

That mindset has got me to where I am today.\"McGregor grew up in Crumlin, a working class suburb of Dublin.He once recalled that grenades would be posted through letterboxes as drug dealing and gang culture began to take over the area, though that depiction has been challenged.McGregor attributes much of his success to his background and upbringing, but also to the fierce bond he feels with his family name.\"The McGregor name is historic when it comes to combat,\" he says proudly. \"Way back, study my family's name, study my family's heritage.

Two of the criminal mischief charges are felonies.His also was was ordered to stay away from five people involved in the incident. McGregor, who was not asked to enter a plea, left the courthouse without saying anything to the media.Ira Judelson, a bail bondsman, said that McGregor, an Irish citizen, would be able to keep his passport. McGregor will have to check in with Judelson once a week, the bondsman said. Read MoreConor McGregor, left, is led to a vehicle while leaving an NYPD building Friday morning. McGregor is accused of throwing something through the window of a bus, injuring a passenger, according to an NYPD source with knowledge of the event. Video from TMZ Sports shows someone picking up a two-wheeled dolly and throwing it into a bus window, smashing the glass.Prosecutors said in court that McGregor punched a security guard at Barclays Center during the melee. The person was treated at a hospital and released. A second mixed martial arts fighter, Cian Cowley, faces three criminal mischief, one assault and one reckless endangerment charge, police said. Cowley allegedly threw a chair at the bus. His bail was set at $25,000. Their next court appearance was scheduled for June 14. CNN could not immediately reach representatives for McGregor or Cowley for comment. Ahead of the court appearance, McGregor and Cowley were seen separately being escorted out of the NYPD's 78th precinct building and into cars, with their hands apparently restrained behind their backs.Mixed martial arts fighter Cian Cowley is led Friday morning from the NYPD's 78th precinct building.The bus attack is just one issue clouding Saturday night's events. Fighter Max Holloway tweeted Friday that he'd been forced to withdraw from his top-billed match against Khabib Nurmagomedov for the lightweight title, which UFC is stripping from McGregor because of his long absence from UFC fights.Holloway -- who'd only just accepted the match days ago after another fighter was injured -- was deemed unable to safely cut his weight to the required 155-pound limit in time for the event, ESPN reported.UFC announced Nurmagomedov will fight Al Iaquinta, who didn't make the weight limit and will not be eligible to win the title. Should Nurmagomedov prevail, he will take the title that was held by McGregor.Customers can receive a refund where they bought their tickets, if they choose, UFC said.McGregor had 'beef' with fighter, UFC president saysMcGregor and his entourage of about 20 people were let into the arena through a door during a media-day event by someone affiliated with a credentialed website, UFC president Dana White told the website MMAjunkie.Conor McGregor: UFC star was 'born with fists clenched'The group went down to the loading dock where some fighters who were to participate in Saturday's event were getting on buses.McGregor's group attacked a bus using trash cans, metal barricades and the dolly, White said.\"This is the most disgusting thing that has ever happened in the history of the company,\" White told MMAjunkie, adding later, \"This was a real bad career move for him.\"White said McGregor had \"some sort of beef\" with Nurmagomedov, who was on the bus and is fighting Saturday for the lightweight title McGregor is vacating.Two fighters injured; another removed for alleged attack 'involvement'Two fighters were injured in the bus attack, UFC has said, and their UFC 223 bouts have been canceled. Lightweight fighter Michael Chiesa and suffered head and facial cuts from broken glass, White told MMAjunkie. Chiesa later said on Twitter that the New York State Athletic Commission determined he would not be allowed to fight on Saturday.Flyweight Ray Borg, who was scheduled to face Brandon Moreno, is also unfit to fight due to multiple corneal abrasions, according to the UFC.

        "content": "Budapest, Hungary (CNN)Opposition parties say Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is too chummy with Russia's Vladimir Putin and that his government is corrupt. Yet Orban is on course to win a third consecutive term in Sunday's general elections.Hungary, a member of the European Union and NATO, is no autocracy, but after eight years of Orban's rule, its political system has begun to resemble Russia's.The space for civil society and a functional independent media in Hungary is shrinking rapidly. A law passed in 2011 redrew the lines on the electoral map, in what opposition parties and the media criticized as blatant gerrymandering.Orban, 54, has made no secret of his admiration for Russia's political system. He has proudly described his vision for Hungary as an \"illiberal democracy,\" a phrase that brings Russia's \"sovereign democracy\" to mind, both euphemistic terms for an autocratic style of governance.Orban served first as prime minister from 1998 to 2002, but it was after he was again elected in 2010 that he and Putin began meeting annually. Read MoreAnd like Putin, Orban has surrounded himself with a powerful group of businesspeople. He has also come under scrutiny for awarding contracts to a small number of businessmen and family members, according to a Reuters analysis. His spokesman, Zoltan Kovacs, brushed off these allegations to CNN, saying it was \"up to the courts to decide\" in such cases.Ironically, Orban launched his political career in 1989 with a hard-hitting speech demanding that Soviet forces leave the country after more than 40 years of occupation.A young Viktor Orban gives a speech in 1989, calling for the end of Soviet occupation.\"For two decades, Orban was probably the staunchest anti-Russian politician in the whole of Eastern Europe,\" said Andras Racz, a Russian expert and senior research fellow at the Centre for Strategic and Defense Studies in Budapest.That all changed when he was elected for the second time in 2010, when his public rhetoric on Russia began to take on a positive tone.In a recent report looking at Russian meddling in Austrian, Czech and Hungarian elections, the Budapest-based Political Capital research institute said Hungary was the most vulnerable of the three countries. \"Hungary represents a case where the government has enabled space for Kremlin interference to shore up its own political strength, which is largely based on anti-migrant and anti-European integration policies,\" the report says.Kovacs dismissed the idea that Russia wielded influence on Orban or his government as \"stupid.\"\"There's not one element of our policies that can suggest to you that we're closer to Russia or Mr. Putin in any way than any Western European country,\" he said.                 Russia's playbookBut some of Hungary's new policies look like they're straight out of Russia's playbook.Hungary passed a law last year that imposes restrictions on nongovernmental organizations receiving foreign funding. The law looks almost identical to Russia's Foreign Agent Law, which has been used to crack down on opposition voices and independent media.The Hungarian law requires NGOs receiving more than 24,000 euros from foreign entities to register with the government and disclose their sources. Orban has argued it is necessary for transparency and to stamp out money laundering, but Hungarian NGOs see it as an attempt specifically to target organizations funded by billionaire philanthropist George Soros. Soros's Open Society Foundations has been banned from Russia, which sees the organization as a security threat.   The Hungarian government has since last year vilified Soros in countless billboards across the country. One pictures him with opposition party leaders, and another says, \"Let's not allow Soros to have the last laugh!\"A Fidesz billboard features Soros among opposition figures and says, \"They would dismantle the border fence together.\"Peter Szijjarto, the country's foreign affairs minister, defended the campaign, labeling Soros a \"national security risk,\" in a statement. He accused the financier of wanting to demolish a border security fence and \"settle hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants in Europe and Hungary.\" Soros's spokesman said his views have been misrepresented. Soros was born in Hungary to a Jewish family and fled to the UK in the 1940s to escape Nazi occupation. He later immigrated to the United States, where he became one of the world's richest investors and a philanthropist. In fact, it was thanks to a Soros-funded scholarship that Orban was able to study at the University of Oxford.The anti-Soros campaign sits uncomfortably close to a resurgence of anti-Semitism in the country, which has entered Hungarian politics in parliamentary debate.Kovacs told CNN that while Hungary must allow open borders to EU citizens as a member of the bloc, it did not want any migration at all beyond that. He praised Hungary's border fences with Serbia and Croatia, built in 2015 specifically to keep asylum seekers out.     Orban's control of the mediaJournalist Anita Komuves, 35, says she is targeted by the government on two fronts -- first because she's a reporter and second as someone who works for an NGO receiving funding from Soros.Komuves worked for Hungary's largest opposition print newspaper, Nepszabadsag, for 11 years before it was shut down suddenly in 2016. She found out about the closure from a news alert on her phone.The government denies shutting it down, but Komuves says that it \"was obviously a political decision.\"\"It was because we uncovered too many stories about corruption.\"The company that owned the newspaper, Mediaworks, was sold just weeks later to Lorinc Meszaros, a close Orban ally. \"This way, they took over TV channels, several radio channels, the biggest news portal, a few weekly magazines and the entire regional media outside Budapest,\" Komuves said.Journalists and supporters of newspaper Nepszabadsag protest in Budapest on October 16, 2016.Komuves thought about leaving her profession, but she found a job with Atlatszo, an NGO of journalists, hackers and lawyers, one of the few remaining independent media organizations left in the country In a recent article, she argued that while there was evidence of Russian trolling and fake news sites in Hungary, Moscow didn't need to try particularly hard to influence the vote, because Orban and his government already lean toward Moscow and they lead in the polls.State media has also expanded under Orban and is working as a propaganda machine, Komuves said. It has picked up a significant number of news stories by Russia's Sputnik and Russia Today, both widely considered mouthpieces of the Russian government.Orban has also used the law to clamp down on the media, spearheading legislation that established a new parliament-appointed media control body that fined media outlets for \"imbalanced\" news coverage, or content that the body considers \"insulting\" to the majority. The financial crisis of 2008 left many media organizations open to takeovers. Around 90% of Hungary's media is now either directly or indirectly controlled by Orban's Fidesz party, according to Marius Dragomir, director at the Centre for Media, Data and Society at the Central European University's School of Public Policy.   Writing in a blog post for the London School of economics, he described the situation as \"a classic case of media capture.\"The widely watched TV2 was bought by a Hungarian-American former Hollywood producer, Andy Vajna, who had worked in Orban's government. He won the procurement in a legal battle against Lajos Simicska, a media tycoon and friend-turned-foe of Orban.Swaths of local media were also bought up by Meszaros, an Orban ally who rose from working as a gas fitter to become a wealthy businessman and the mayor of the town where Orban was born, Felcsut.Orban's football obsessionIt was one of Meszaros's companies that built a large football stadium right across from Orban's childhood home in Felcsut.It seats 3,500 people in the town of just 1,600, and has been ridiculed in independent media as a vanity project for the soccer-obsessed leader.Besides the stadium, there is little going on in Felcsut. Along a dusty stretch of road there are two small grocery stores, a rundown coffee shop and a tobacconist.The stadium represents much of what Hungarians are becoming frustrated with -- corruption allegations have begun to spread through Orban's government and questions are regularly raised about the way lucrative government contracts are awarded. Janosne Abraham says the government should do more for poor Hungarians.Janosne Abraham, a 59-year-old woman who works at the larger of Felcsut's two grocery stores, is vocally critical of Orban.\"Where is all the money? He just steals it all and doesn't spend it on anything useful, like healthcare,\" she said.\"That football stadium is a waste. It costs so much to light up and clean, and it hasn't brought in money for the town.\"Abraham isn't happy about Orban's relationship with Putin either.Pancho Arena in Felcsut, a town of just 1,600.She points to a nuclear power plant project that Hungary awarded to Russia's state-owned Rosatom,saying that she was worried her country would become too dependent on Russia for energy. The project was controversial because Hungary awarded the contract to Rosatom without a tender process and without revealing its costs to the state budget. The European Commission originally opposed the funding plan, which involved a 10 billion-euro investment from Russia, but after an investigation it gave it the green light.Kovacs defended the government's process, saying that only Russia had the experience and the technology to carry it out. He denied there was anything opaque about it.But even for those fed up with Orban, there are few feasible alternatives. The opposition is fragmented and no other party appears to have a real chance of winning.A woman with her children playing on the street in Felcsut said she would vote for Orban's party because, \"This town is all Fidesz. It's better to stay silent and not get into conflicts.\"She is disappointed with allegations of government corruption, but she points out Orban's government wouldn't be Hungary's first to misuse funds. \"They're all the same.\"",

I was earning money working for them, had a place to stay and, from there, a university spotted me playing netball and that's how my career started.\"Uganda narrowly lost to New Zealand 64-51 on day of the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games.While studying for a diploma in development studies at Nkumba University, Proscovia's feats on the  court and in the classroom earned her a scholarship to play netball and study business administration at the Uganda Christian University. Still a student, she caught the eye of English Superleague club Loughborough Lightning while playing for Uganda in a World Cup qualifier against Botswana three years ago, and the country girl who knew little of life beyond Africa left for England.

Apparently in an effort to shift the debate away from the issue of culpability, a succession of Russian officials have attempted to make light of the whole affair.Read MoreInvestigators work in the garden of Sergei Skripal's house on March 22.The issue of the pets was first raised by Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Wednesday. \"Where are they now?\" she said, speaking to reporters.  \"After all, we are talking about living organisms, and if a poisonous agent was used in the house, they must also have been affected,\" she continued.Later, at the United Nations Security Council on Thursday, Russia's representative Vassily Nebenzia read out extracts from a copy of Alice in Wonderland in an attempt to discredit Britain's claims that Russia was responsible for the Skripals' fate.After the death of the animals was confirmed, the Russian embassy in London said their value as pieces of evidence had been ignored. \"Such treatment of pets is also hardly consistent with UK laws on animal cruelty and comes as a blatant disregard to Mr Skripal's rights as the owner and companion of the animals,\" the embassy said, claiming a second cat was still missing.DEFRA told CNN that only one cat had been found on the property and offered no information about a possible second cat. It could not say whether there was any evidence the animals had been poisoned.Detectives revealed last week that they believe Skripal and his daughter Yulia first came into contact with a nerve agent at the former spy's home and that the highest concentration of the substance had been found on the front door.Experts unable to identify source of nerve agent but UK says it's RussiaSergei Skripal remains critically ill but stable in hospital. Yulia, also poisoned in the attack, is now conscious and talking. In a statement released Thursday, the 33-year-old said she woke up \"over a week ago\" and her \"strength is growing daily.\" Yulia and Sergei Skripal were found slumped on a bench at an outdoor shopping precinct. The British government believes they were poisoned with a Russian-made nerve agent, Novichok. Russia denies involvement and the incident has led to a spiraling diplomatic dispute between the two nations.The UK and its allies have expelled scores of Russian diplomats, triggering retaliatory expulsions by Russia. At the United Nations Security Council meeting on Thursday, Nebenzia, Russia's envoy, called the allegations a \"fake story\" and said the UK was \"playing with fire and they will be sorry.\"The British government insists that only Russia had the capability to carry out the attack.CNN's Katie Polglase and Sebastian Shukla contributed to this report.",

Amid growing political tension between the United Kingdom and Russia, the two-leg fixture could provide important lessons for World Cup organizers and authorities in how to deal with potential flashpoints at this summer's tournament in Russia. Follow @cnnsport\n\nThe World Cup has been the focus of much of the mudslinging between Westminster and the Kremlin since the poisoning of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the English city of Salisbury on March 5.Russian and English fans have a history of  violence after packs of supporters clashed two years ago at the European Championship in Marseille, France, causing local police to intervene with riot gear and tear gas.About 500 CSKA fans are expected to attend Thursday's match, Russian news agency TASS reported.Read More\"The fans should behave decently, avoid looking for trouble and must not be instigating conflicts,\" Vladimir Markin, the head of the Russian Football Union's (RFU) Committee on security and interaction with football fans, told TASS.\"These people are traveling abroad and they must keep in mind that they are representing Russia,\" added Mutko.England World Cup fans will be 'safe in Russia,' says Russian ambassadorAhead of England's international friendly with Italy at Wembley stadium last month, CNN Sport spoke to fans about how the English visitors will be welcomed at the World Cup. The fans provided a diverse range of opinions -- from those who believe the diplomatic row will have no impact on the tournament, to those expressing serious concern for the safety of the 25,000 to 30,000 England fans set to travel to Russia. 'Football is for the people, by the people'A group of elderly fans, all former members of the Women's Royal Naval Service, told CNN they wouldn't be following the team in Russia this summer, adding that they feared for the safety of the fans who were traveling to the tournament. \"I would think they probably won't be welcomed with open arms,\" said one of the women. \"I wouldn't want to go.\"Arsenal heads to Moscow in Europa League amid tense UK-Russia relationsOther fans had more optimistic takes on the World Cup and its peacemaking potential.\"The wonderful thing about football is that it brings us all together, and hopefully we'll bury politics -- and Theresa May and Putin can put their differences aside,\" said another England fan at Wembley. In the aftermath of the Salisbury poisoning, UK Prime Minister Theresa May announced that no members of the government would travel to Russia for the tournament.The Duke of Cambridge also has no plans to attend the World Cup despite being president of the Football Association. It will be the first time in decades that no senior Royal has attended the event.  UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson drew comparisons between the tournament in Russia and Adolf Hitler's use of the 1936 Berlin Olympics to promote the Nazis' agenda. JUST WATCHEDWhere and when did nerve agent attack happen?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhere and when did nerve agent attack happen? 02:09Russia, on the other hand, has maintained that England fans should have no worries about their safety at the tournament, despite the diplomatic tussle.\"All necessary measures are being take,\" Russia's ambassador to Britain Alexander Yakovenko has said.One England fan still planning to go to Russia for the World Cup said his biggest fear is that the UK government may prevent fans from going. \"I'm not concerned about the Russian people or government,\" he explained. \"I think we'll be made more than welcome. I've worked four years for this, I'm going, and I think we'll have a great time -- lovely people, lovely country. \"Football is for the people, by the people -- why would we do anything else?\"A return to hooliganism?Who are Russia's hardcore hooligans?The pictures of marauding fans in the streets of Marseille in 2016 were, for some, a shock return to the dark days of football hooliganism in the 1980s.  Marseille authorities said packs of hardcore Russian fans appeared \"well trained\" and targeted English fans with military precision.There was crowd trouble in CSKA Moscow's second-leg round-of-16 clash against Lyon in France last month, reportedly leaving five police officers injured, though it was the French team's fans who have been widely condemned for the violence.Fans from another of Moscow's teams, Spartak, were involved in violent clashes with Athletic Bilbao supporters in Spain earlier this season, resulting in the death of one police officer.And the issue of hooliganism arose again last month as more than 100 England fans were arrested in Amsterdam for public disorder around their friendly game against the Netherlands. England and Russia fans clash in Marseille ahead of their group stage match at Euro 2016.Fans attending the Italy game in London -- more of a family affair than the Netherlands clash -- were unanimous in condemning the violence in Amsterdam.One supporter told CNN: \"I don't think those people who were arrested are England fans, I think they're people who go looking for trouble. \"When you come to Wembley there's never any trouble, and your average fan of football just wants to come and support the team and have a drink and a good time.\"Another fan, who has been following England for more than 40 years, explained that the violence is restricted to small groups within the fan community.\"You can see trouble when it's coming and you walk away,\" he said. \"I was in Marseille [in 2016] and you just walk away from it, it's fine. I don't have a problem.He added: \"I might be naive. But I know the boys and girls I've been with are going to behave. We just want to go and have a nice time with the Russian people, it's a nice country -- what's the problem? I genuinely don't see what the problem is.\"One 83-year-old fan, who has followed England through good and bad periods in the team's history, and seen the lowest moments for fan hooliganism, said: \"It used to be a big problem for us, and I hope it doesn't get any worse than it has done recently. I hope it doesn't escalate.\"",

        "content": "April's edition of Living Golf focuses on Spain's special relationship with the Masters. Watch the show by following this link. (CNN)For years, Sergio Garcia endured heartbreak in full view of the public.Near misses in golf's four most prestigious tournaments saw him labeled the best player to never win a major, while the breakdown of high-profile relationships had a negative impact on his golf game.In early 2002, a romance with Martina Hingis briefly created a sporting power couple before the two split in the fall of the same year.A break up with Morgan-Leigh Norman, daughter of Greg Norman, in 2009 hit Garcia hard and affected his performance. \nStruggling to fulfill his undoubted potential, Garcia spoke of how he couldn't play to his best if he felt sub-par in his personal life.Read MoreAgainst this backdrop, and over 21 years, Garcia went 0 for 73 in majors. On several occasions he came close, only to falter at the final moment.At the Masters last year, though, his luck changed. A playoff victory over Justin Rose gave him a breakthrough triumph, the seeds of which were sown in 2015.That was the year Angela Akins came into his life. A Golf Channel TV reporter who had recently divorced, she met Garcia at a tournament in Houston.\"Sergio likes to say when he's happy off the golf course, it's easier for him to be happy on the course and that makes a lot of sense,\" explains Akins-Garcia, as Angela has been known since the two married last July.  \"Obviously if you have turmoil in your life, anything that you're doing as a profession is going to be more difficult.\"Her role in the golf media helped her understand the pressure on Garcia as a professional athlete, and his legacy of nearly moments. It also helped that she'd played college golf for the University of Texas.  ''It might not be the same as playing professionally but I think I know what it takes to win,'' she told CNN Living Golf's Shane O'Donoghue. ''I know what it takes to be successful at something because all of my life I've worked really hard and that was instilled upon me by my parents. \"I might be as competitive as him, in some ways more so.'' Garcia and Akins got engaged in January last year. Three months later, the Spaniard was slipping on the green jacket.Angela left her job on The Golf Channel to focus full time on traveling with Garcia and it paid dividends. A big win at the Omega Dubai Desert Classic in February 2017 followed soon after their engagement and Garcia arrived at the Masters in good form and a strong frame of mind.''He just seemed calmed the entire time,'' says Angela. ''Inside I was sitting there thinking this guy is playing in the Masters, maybe the biggest tournament in the world, but he just pretends or is able to just let that go when he's off the golf course.\"I think that's what makes Sergio really special.''And what took place on the final day at Augusta last year was special. After the pair finished tied on nine-under-par after the final round, Garcia and Rose went back to the 18th tee to begin the playoff.Rose's drive found the trees while Garcia's landed on the fairway. Garcia's approach came to a stop 12 feet from the hole and gave him two putts to take the title.He only needed one.\"It's a funny feeling because I've had some of those moments where I've been quite nervy and maybe not as comfortable,\" the 40-year-old recalls. \"This time I was comfortable because I was very calm. So I was very confident. \"Even though there was some nervous moments, I felt like I was very much in control ... I wasn't getting caught up in it.. it was great fun to be part of.\"For Angela, it was the sporting highlight of a year that gave the couple plenty of reasons to smile.\"I think it's more than we expected at the beginning of the year,\" explains Angela.\"Obviously with the Masters win that kind of started it all off and then we got married in the summer time and then shortly after found out we were going to have a baby. It's just been incredible.''I think that we bring out the best in each other and he's told me that I bring out the best in him.''I mean what more can you ask for from the person that you spend the rest of your life with?''Finding peace away from the golf course has certainly made Garcia a better player.And the life-changing impact of his Masters win is evident in the naming of the couple's daughter; Azalea, after the most famous flower to grow at Augusta National.''Sergio's amazing with kids,'' Angela told Living Golf late last year. ''Anyone who's been around him with children or young people can see that and they just gravitate towards him. I think he's going to be a wonderful dad.''

About 70 patients were evacuated.Hasan Tahsin Usta, mayor of Gaziosmanpasa, said that the fire, which spread down the outside of the building, was almost under control and no casualties had been reported, according to Anadolu.

        "content": "London (CNN)Britain's claim that Moscow was behind the poisoning of a former Russian spy faced fresh scrutiny Wednesday when it emerged the UK government had deleted a tweet blaming Russia for producing the nerve agent used in the attack.The UK Foreign Office acknowledged it had removed the social media post, which stated that British chemical weapons experts believed Russia made the nerve agent, Novichok, used to poison Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the English city of Salisbury on March 4.A Foreign Office spokesperson told CNN that the tweet was removed because it was \"truncated and did not accurately report\" a briefing by the British ambassador to Moscow last month.The revelation came as the UK government was already on the defensive on the issue. On Tuesday, the chief executive of the Porton Down defense laboratory in the UK said scientists could not confirm where the nerve agent  was made. The British government insisted that additional material from intelligence sources led it to the conclusion that Russia was behind the attack.Russia, which has repeatedly denied involvement in the attack and has sought to blame Britain instead, seized on the developments. The Russian embassy in London tweeted: \"Why would @foreignoffice delete this tweet from 22 March?\"Read MoreThe controversy centered on a briefing on the Salisbury poisoning given by the British ambassador to Moscow, Laurie Bristow, on March 22. In it, he said \"the analysts at Porton Down, the Defense Science and Technology Laboratory in the UK, established and made clear that this was a military-grade chemical weapon. One of the Novichok series; a nerve agent as I said produced in Russia.\"A tweet, which the Foreign Office said was published in \"real time\", paraphrased the comments, saying: \"Analysis by world-leading experts at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down made clear that this was a military-grade Novichok nerve agent produced in Russia.\"The tweet was deleted sometime before March 27. An identical tweet by the UK embassy in Russia, was also deleted.The Foreign Office spokesperson said the decision to delete the tweets did not change the UK government's assessment that Russia was responsible for the \"brazen and reckless act\" of poisoning the Skripals. Britain and its allies, including the US, France and Germany, have expelled more than 100 Russian diplomats from their countries over the poisoning, prompting a series of reciprocal expulsions of foreign diplomats from Russia. Porton Down contradicts JohnsonNews of the deleted tweets came a day after  Gary Aitkenhead, the head of the Porton Down laboratory said that while scientists were sure that only a \"state actor\" could have accessed the nerve agent, they could not say definitively where it was made.\"We have not identified the precise source, but we have provided the scientific info to government, who have then used a number of other sources to piece together the conclusions you have come to,\"  Aitkenhead told Sky News.He added: \"It is our job to provide the scientific evidence of what this particular nerve agent is. We identified that it is from this particular family and that it is a military grade, but it is not our job to say where it was manufactured.\"His comments contradicted remarks made by Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who was asked last month how the government was able to quickly conclude that Russia was the source of the nerve agent. \"When I look at the evidence, the people from Porton Down, the laboratory, they were absolutely categorical,\" Johnson told the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle.\"I asked the guy myself, I said: 'Are you sure?' And he said: 'There's no doubt.' So we have very little alternative but to take the action that we have taken,\" said Johnson. UK chemical weapons representative slams RussiaThe brewing controversy over the tweets threatened to overshadow an emergency summit of the world's chemical weapons watchdog in The Hague on Wednesday to discuss the poisoning of the Skripals. The British delegation to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) slammed a Russian proposal for a joint investigation into the incident as \"perverse,\" describing it as a \"diversionary tactic\" aimed at evading questions over Moscow's alleged role in the attack. Speaking at the meeting, called at Russia's request, the UK said the Kremlin's response to the Skripal case, as well as chemical weapons attacks allegedly committed by the Syrian regime, were proof of its disdain for international monitors. \"It seems clear that Russia will never accept the legitimacy of any investigation into chemical weapons use unless it comes up with an answer Russia likes,\" said John Foggo, the UK representative to the OPCW.The European Union's representative at the chemical weapons meeting, Krassimir Kostov, also backed the UK's assessment that it was \"highly likely\" Russia was behind the attack, telling delegates of the EU's \"shock at the offensive use of any military-grade nerve agent, of a type developed by Russia, for the first time in European soil in over 70 years.\"CNN's Sheena McKenzie contributed to this report.",

Such was the extent of the damage, the bus was deemed undriveable and a replacement had to be sent from Manchester to pick up the players after the match.Read MoreManchester City's team bus is hit by projectiles thrown by Liverpool fans.\"I really don't understand it,\" Klopp told BT Sport before the game. \"There was a lot of talk about it before and we tried everything to avoid a situation like that. \"When we came through it was obviously very positive, but we didn't know when we were on the bus what had happened before because the City bus was in front of us. \"From Liverpool FC I have to say sorry.\"Merseyside Police said although no-one on the bus was injured there were injuries to two policemen.\"This behaviour by a number of people who threw bottles, cans and pyrotechnics towards the bus is completely unacceptable and we will conduct enquiries to identify who was responsible and bring them to justice,\" said Merseyside Police Match Commander Superintendent Paul White in a statement.\"We worked very closely with both clubs to ensure the safety of the public and the teams themselves, and it is disappointing to see that a number of people behaved in this appalling way.\"Pep Guardiola was visibly upset, the Manchester City manager referring to the bomb attack on Borussia Dortmund's team bus last season.\"I want to say thank you to Jurgen for his words apologizing,\" he said. \"I know I didn't expect that, we didn't expect that. After what happened last season in Dortmund, I didn't expect it. \"Yesterday in the press conference, people asked me about that and I thought the police would know that. Fortunately nothing happened to the players for their health. \"I know that is not Liverpool, I know the history of the club is much bigger than this.\"READ: Cristiano Ronaldo's 'Playstation goal' is talk of the worldREAD: Where does Cristiano Ronaldo's bicycle kick rank among the greatest ever?30-minute madnessThat atmosphere was carried into the ground, Liverpool fans beginning an unrelenting 90 minutes of noise with a spine-tingling rendition of \"You'll Never Walk Alone.\"The first goal came after just 12 minutes, dramatically increasing the decibels levels inside an Anfield stadium which had been rocking well before kick-off.Sadio Mane intercepted a stray pass on the edge of his area, before playing a through ball between two defenders to set Mohamed Salah haring down the line.The Egyptian, in contention for the Player of the Season award in his first season back in the Premier League, freed Roberto Firmino who wriggled inside and forced a save from Ederson.City right back Kyle Walker dawdled on the ball as the rebound fell at his feet, allowing Firmino to prod the ball into Salah's path and Liverpool's player of the season hammered the ball into the net.It was somewhat against the run of play, with City dominating both possession and territory inside the opening 10 minutes but it caused the first-half momentum to shift completely.The Liverpool fans, now in true party mood, didn't even have to wait another 10 minutes for their side to double the lead.James Milner, who at times seemed to be in two places at once, won possession back from Ilkay Gundogan and the ball rolled kindly into Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's path on the edge of the box.Anfield erupts! \ud83d\udd34\u26aa\ufe0fMo Salah nets in front of the Kop and it's first blood to Liverpool! \ud83d\udc4a pic.twitter.com/0oIczhhgE2\u2014 Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) April 4, 2018\n\nThe midfielder took one touch, before arrowing the ball into the corner -- reminiscent of many a Steven Gerrard goal in front of the Kop on a Champions League night.Guardiola's side, which is close to winning the Premier League title, were visibly reeling. Usually full of unshakeable confidence and swagger, his players looked lost and frightened in possession, while individual mistakes were allowing endless waves of Liverpool attacks.And if they thought the opening 20 minutes were bad, it was about to get worse. Salah was again at the heart of the move, floating a cross towards to far post to allow Mane a simple header to give Liverpool a scarcely believable 3-0 lead after just half an hour.By the time the referee blew his whistle to signal the end of the half, Manchester City -- who have so often blitzed opposition teams this season -- hadn't even registered a single shot on target.Much-maligned goalkeeper Loris Karius was having arguably the most comfortable evening of his Liverpool career.Klopp appeared to have set his side out perfectly, his forwards and midfielders hunting City players down in perfectly choreographed packs.WHAT. A. HIT! \ud83d\ude80Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain with an absolute screamer!Liverpool 2-0 Man City \ud83d\ude2e pic.twitter.com/W21fO3v9lc\u2014 Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) April 4, 2018\n\nWhen out of possession, Liverpool's often leaky and chaotic back line looked confident and assured, barely breaking a sweat when Kevin De Bruyne and Co. were bearing down on goal.The on-pitch performance only served to further encourage those in the stands, the Liverpool players conducting the sizable orchestra in the Kop end. Every misplaced City pass -- of which there were many -- was met with jubilant jeers from the home crowd, while every time Salah got in possession the murmur of excitement would intensify.Liverpool understandably began the second half cautiously, not displaying the same gung-ho approach which had earned them such a huge lead.An early injury to Salah, which appeared to be a groin tweak, forced Klopp into a defensive change, replacing his star forward with midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum.It was an enforced substitution which paid dividends, as Liverpool nullified City every time it looked as though they might trouble them.However, Guardiola will have every right to feel aggrieved after Raheem Sterling's goal was incorrectly ruled out following an offside called against Leroy Sane on the wing.Man City failed to register a single shot on target against Liverpool this evening \ud83d\ude33 pic.twitter.com/vq7TiH508h\u2014 Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) April 4, 2018\n\nIt will be a bitter pill to swallow, in particular as it looked as though Salah was offside in the build up to Liverpool's opening goal.When it looked as though City may find that crucial away goal, Sterling and Gabriel Jesus contrived to tackle each other in the attacking half. If there was a moment to sum up City's performance, it was that.But one final ear-bursting rendition of \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" from the Liverpool faithful urged their team across the line.An underwhelming Manchester City side will need to regroup quickly ahead of next week's second leg at the Etihad, with Guardiola's Champions League hopes hanging by a thread.",

On April 5, the eve of the first match of the Asian Women's Cup, the players will then make their record-breaking attempt on a pitch built especially for the occasion. HRH Prince Ali will also be in attendance. \"This particular challenge is aimed at opening doors for women and girls, especially in Jordan and surrounding countries,\" says Murphy. \"We want to open doors for them to walk through. We know there are a lot of women and girls in Jordan who haven't even thought of going out and having a kick around. \"We want to help normalize sport for women and girls.

Only five others have done it -- Woods, Nicklaus, Gary Player, Ben Hogan and Gene Sarazen.

        "content": "London (CNN)On Friday, Jewish families around the world will gather to celebrate Passover and recount the exodus from Egypt.But for many British Jews, an altogether more contemporary subject is also likely to be on the agenda at the festive meal.On Monday, the leadership of Britain's biggest Jewish groups organized an unprecedented demonstration outside the UK Parliament, accusing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn of turning a blind eye to a resurgence of anti-Semitism in British politics, particularly within his own party.For some at the protest, the prospect of Corbyn becoming the next leader of Britain -- which came into sharp focus when Prime Minister Theresa May's working majority was wiped out in last year's general election -- is a sobering one.\"As a Jewish community in London, we're pretty scared,\" protester Freddy Clode told CNN.Read More\"Being Jewish myself, it frightens me what he's about.\"Protesters hold placards as they demonstrate in Parliament Square.This week's demonstration was the culmination of frustration that has simmered since Corbyn's surprise election as Labour leader in 2015 catapulted him from a marginal figure on the far left of British politics to the mainstream alternative to Theresa May.For much of his career, Corbyn, an outspoken critic of Israel and a fierce campaigner for Palestinian rights, remained on the fringes of his party. But his victory in the 2015 leadership election has drawn scrutiny to some of the company he has kept in the past -- and has coincided with a rise in anti-Semitic rhetoric directed in particular at some of those within the Labour Party who opposed his candidacy.Corbyn's detractors point to his association with Paul Eisen, a Holocaust denier, his defense of  Reverend Stephen Sizer, who shared materials online linking Jews to the 9/11 attack, and welcoming visitor Sheikh Raed Salah to Parliament, who has allegedly used the blood libel -- the false accusation that Jews have murdered Christian children to use their blood in rituals.He has also referred to Hamas and Hezbollah as \"friends\" though he later said he regretted using such language.More recently, it was also revealed that Corbyn was a member of two Facebook groups, \"Palestine Live\" and \"History of Palestine\" in which anti-Semitic commentary and imagery was prevalent. Corbyn said he was added to the groups by other people and removed himself after their content was brought to his attention.Corbyn's allies have also drawn fire. Former Mayor of London Ken Livingstone was suspended after claiming Hitler was a Zionist. Another Labour lawmaker, Naz Shah, was also suspended over remarks she made over Israel on Facebook.A number of Labour local councilors and supporters, predominantly from the Corbynite left of the party, have also been caught up in allegations of anti-Semitism. Protesters hold placards as they demonstrate in Parliament Square against anti-Semitism on March 26, 2018 in London.While his critics do not believe Corbyn to be an anti-Semite, he has, according to Labour lawmaker Margaret Hodge, allowed himself to become the \"poster boy for anti-Semites everywhere.\"Corbyn has repeatedly defended himself, insisting he is committed to tackling anti-Semitism and all forms of racism.But his efforts have been widely criticized, including a 2016 Labour party inquiry into anti-Semitism which led the author of the report, Shami Chakrabarti, to conclude there was \"too much clear evidence... of ignorant attitudes\". Corbyn described the report as important and said it would help the party set the \"gold standard\" on anti-racism. But the Vice President of the British Board of Deputies, Marie van der Zyl, called it a whitewash. There was also further consternation when Corbyn appointed Chakrabarti, who had been cast as an independent figure, to the House of Lords and made her a member of his shadow cabinet.But the defining moment came last week, when a Labour MP demanded to know why Corbyn had offered his support in 2012 to a graffiti artist whose mural featured several anti-Semitic tropes.Members of the Jewish community hold a protest against Britain's opposition Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn and anti-semitism in the  Labour party.The mural, by a street artist known as Mear One, appeared to show Jewish bankers playing Monopoly with their table resting on the backs of bent-over workers. It was threatened with removal by a local London council.\"Why,\" asked Corbyn in a Facebook comment. \"You are in good company. Rockerfeller [sic] destroyed Diego Viera's [sic] mural because it includes a picture of Lenin.\"Labour badly fumbled its response. An initial brief statement, issued by a spokesman for the leader, was widely derided as inadequate. Only after Corbyn's own MPs expressed fury was a further statement issued, this time in Corbyn's name, which offered a more expansive expression of regret.\"I sincerely regret that I did not look more closely at the image I was commenting on, the contents of which are deeply disturbing and anti-Semitic,\" Corbyn said.\"I am opposed to the production of anti-Semitic material of any kind, and the defence of free speech cannot be used as a justification for the promotion of anti-Semitism in any form.\"But it was too late, and at the weekend the British Board of Deputies and the Jewish Leadership Council, two bodies which represent mainstream British Jewry, called for a demonstration.Freddie Clode (right) and his brother, Gus, took part in the protest.Freddy Clode, 25, felt he had to come out and protest, despite the short notice. At the protest, his brother Gus held an image of Corbyn's face with his famous slogan of \"For the many, not the few\" rewritten as \"For the many, not the Jew.\" The brothers said the complaints of anti-Semitism leveled at the Labour leader have been ignored.\"When they came up for that caption, 'for the many, not the few,' it just seemed to be the ideal opportunity to get the point across,\" Freddy Clode said. \"It's not that his hatred for Jews has got stronger over the past year, it's that he could get into power. It's very scary to have that as a possibility.\"Standing opposite Parliament, Naomi Stanley, a retired health worker with Britain's National Health Service (NHS),  told CNN she is even preparing herself to leave the UK if Labour forms the next government.Naomi Stanley says she would move to Israel if Corbyn became Prime Minister.\"I will absolutely leave the country and I tell you that with an incredibly sad heart. I'm British, I love England. I love everything here. I love the British birdsong, I have an English garden, I built my home here.\"\"I'm a retired nurse after years of working in the NHS but I tell you what, if Jeremy Corbyn gets in with the Labour party then I'm out of here.\"\"I'm going over to Israel next month to do a recce. I don't want to have to leave but I'm not an idiot and I can see what is happening.\"\"This is dangerous and serious stuff.\"Members of the Jewish community hold a protest against Britain's opposition Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn and anti-semitism in the  Labour party, outside the British Houses of Parliament.The growing concerns of the British Jewish community come at a time when anti-Semitism is on the rise in Europe.In Poland, the ruling Law and Justice Party has been accused of attempting to rewrite the history of the Holocaust by introducing a controversial new law, leading to the country's Jewish organization saying it has created a \"growing wave of intolerance, xenophobia, and anti-Semitism,\" leaving many within the community feeling unsafe.Hungary has faced accusations of anti-Semitism in the lead-up to this year's election with critics of President Viktor Orban claiming he has used anti-Semitic tropes during his campaign.In Austria, the far-right Freedom Party were welcomed into the governing coalition, much to the consternation of the country's Jewish community.France, home to the largest Jewish community in western Europe, has been the subject of violent attacks for a number of years, including the murder of four people at a Paris Kosher supermarket in 2015.Last week, a Holocaust survivor was murdered in her Paris apartment in an attack which police are investigating as anti-Semitic.In Britain, physical anti-Semitic attacks are rare and no mainstream politician would advocate openly anti-Semitic political positions. So it feels shocking that any member of Britain's 263,000-strong Jewish community would feel so disillusioned by the Labour Party's attitude to the issue as to contemplate leaving.\"We've reached this point because the completely legitimate concerns which have been expressed by the mainstream Jewish community over the last two and a half years have mostly been ignored,\" Daniel Sugarman, a journalist for the London-based Jewish Chronicle newspaper, told CNN.\"Mr Corbyn has had a number of invitations from us to sit down for an interview and make his position clear. He has declined in the past to do so. You would think that, facing large-scale accusations and seeing support for his party plummet among the Jewish community, Mr Corbyn would have made it a priority to sit down with Jewish communal figures and the Jewish communal media. \"Two and a half years later, he is yet to give an interview to a Jewish newspaper. Mr Corbyn's Jewish acquaintances come, as a whole, from the tiny minority of far-left Jews. He doesn't seem to understand that such people are not all representative of our community. It is hard to see how someone who, regarding some issues, appears not to have changed his mind for 40 years, is suddenly going to change his mind on this.\"Corbyn's supporters say that the accusations leveled at the 68-year-old are \"smears\" and are the work of the Conservative government and British media.'Hurting themselves'At a nearby counter-demonstration by the relatively new fringe group, Jewish Voice for Labour (JVL), protesters argued that Corbyn was being targeted by Britain's right-wing press.Brian Chinnery holds a poster while protesting with the Jewish Voice for Labour group.\"Anti-Semitism is used here in the way that 'crooked Hilary' was used in the US election,\" Brian Chinnery told CNN.\"But it's also made worse because it's being used by the right-wing of the Labour party against Corbyn. Anyone who supports Palestinian rights will be attacked one way or another. These sorts of dog whistle politics are very effective since the media present it as fact.\"Another JVL protester, who did not want to be named and told CNN she was not Jewish, said that the \"Jewish people were hurting themselves\" by holding the protest.\"They are actually like a magnet for more anti-Semitism,\" she added.'Mural'That view is not shared by the mainstream Jewish community, nor many Labour lawmakers, who concede that Corbyn has not done enough to negate anti-Semitism within the party.On Sunday, after following the announcement there would be a protest, Corbyn released another statement, this time saying that he recognized \"that anti-Semitism has occurred in pockets within the Labour Party, causing pain and hurt to our Jewish community in the Labour party and the rest of the country.\"He added: \"I am sincerely sorry for the pain which has been caused.\"I have written to the Board of Deputies and the Jewish Leadership Council. I will never be anything other than a militant opponent of antisemitism. In this fight, I am an ally and always will be. pic.twitter.com/QhQnFEpplU\u2014 Jeremy Corbyn (@jeremycorbyn) March 26, 2018\n\nOn Monday, he sent a letter to the Board of Deputies and the Jewish Leadership Council, offering to meet with them and condemning anti-Semitism as the \"socialism of fools.\"He offered his apology again, and  said he would \"never be anything other than a militant opponent of anti-Semitism. In this fight, I am your ally and always will be.\"For some, that apology may have come too late.",

In his last three events he's finished 12th, tied second and tied fifth. And not just any leaderboard. If anywhere is Woods' patch, it's Augusta National.Four victories and nine other top 10s in 19 Masters as a pro suggests if he has any kind of form, he has a chance.\"He's got a great chance, his game is right there, he's very comfortable around this golf course,\" Rory McIlroy told a media conference Tuesday at Augusta. READ: Rory McIlroy -- Holywood star with box-office appeal     And yet.Woods hasn't played the Masters since 2015 and has missed three of the last four because of the persistent back injury. He tried to get fit, but says in hindsight it was a \"pipe dream\" as his back was \"fried.\"  He last won at Augusta in 2005 when Jordan Spieth, another of this week's likely protagonists, was 11. His last major title was 2008, after which life not only got in the way but tripped him up and kicked him when he was down. READ: McIlroy, Mickelson, Spieth target grand slam elite     Just last year he spoke of \"dark times\" during his various spells out for rehabilitation. He talked of having \"no light at the end of the tunnel\" and feared his career was over. He even worried he might not be able to get back to a full and normal life -- playing with his kids, driving a car, going out to dinner. The pain in his back and down his leg was too bad. Last May he was arrested for driving under the influence and his haggard face was paraded around the world in his police mugshot. The dashcam video of Woods attempting to answer questions was painful viewing for fans. This public humiliation was a new low and the final confirmation for some that he was done.READ: India's Shubhankar Sharma 'believes he can win Masters'     And yet.The painkillers he was using were helping in his recovery from the back fusion surgery -- his fourth procedure since March 2014. Evidence would suggest the op was a major success. Free of the meds, Woods appears to be a new man.

All of a sudden I had this pop in my body and my speed's back and my timing.\"So far this year, the former world No.1 has recorded the fourth fastest club head speed on the PGA Tour. Speed equals distance. So much for an injured ageing has been.  \"I got a second chance on life,\" Woods was quoted as saying on his website last week. \"I'm a walking miracle.\"READ: How Gary Player took golf globalJUST WATCHEDTiger Woods speaks to CNN after 1997 Masters winReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTiger Woods speaks to CNN after 1997 Masters win 01:20'Mystical'That's exactly what golf thought of Woods when he made his splash, winning by a record 12 shots to become the youngest Masters champion at 21 years of age in 1997. He added a second green jacket in 2001, the fourth leg of the famed \"Tiger slam\" for holding all four majors at once (although across two calendar years), and backed it up with a third in 2002 despite the \"Tiger proofing\" of the course to combat his power.Woods' fourth green jacket in 2005 came via one of the most legendary shots in Masters lore -- a chip-in using the viscious slope of the 16th green to coax his ball down into the hole. In his heyday, Woods seemed at times to exist on a different plane. One of his most remarkable -- even slightly mystical performances -- was when he winced his way to his last major victory -- the 2008 US Open -- on what was later diagnosed as a broken leg.Then came the private life scandal that brought him crashing down.

He acknowledges he is nudging towards the sunset of his career, but like other great sportsmen such as tennis legend Roger Federer, Woods refuses to go quietly. Despite the case against him, Woods has forced his way back into the picture. The intangibles seem to outweigh the facts with the great ones.Woods' re-emergence -- dubbed \"superhuman\" by PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan -- has evoked memories of the old days.  But this time he's different.     Greatest comeback?The ultra-focused younger Woods was an icy figure. This Woods is approachable, more engaging -- he even played a practice round at Augusta with former arch rival Phil Mickelson. Time, age and life has mellowed the old gladiators. \"We're at the tail end of our careers, we both know that,\" Woods told his Augusta media conference.\"That was then and this is now.\" READ: Fan Favorite Phil Mickelson still pushing for grand slam gloryAnd now is reporters asking Woods if victory this week would represent the greatest comeback in sports.\"I've got four rounds to play so let's just slow down,\" he laughed.JUST WATCHEDWhat's the best shot Tiger Woods ever hit?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhat's the best shot Tiger Woods ever hit? 01:01 Until the tournament begins, at least, Woods' rivals are delighted he is back in the fray. \"A lot of people quickly forgot what he accomplished,\" said former world No. 1 Jason Day. \"But now he's back and he looks like he was before, everyone's chomping at the bit to see what he can accomplish.\"Woods' fellow American Rickie Fowler added: \"Tiger's earned the attention. After Arnold [Palmer] and Jack [Nicklaus] set it up, Tiger changed the game and took it to a whole new level. He's been the biggest needle mover in the game and it's going to be tough for anyone to come close to that.\"Woods described fellow golfer Ben Hogan's comeback after a head-on car crash with a bus in 1949 as one of sport's greatest comebacks. Nicklaus might have a claim, too, after winning a sixth Masters at the age of 46.  But a fifth green jacket Sunday would put Woods right in the mix.",

That, though, could be about to change.With two wins on the European Tour already this season, Shubhankar Sharma leads a new generation of young Indian golfers with the game's biggest prizes in their sights. Read MoreOutside the top 500 as recently as last November, the 21-year-old has triumphed twice in quick succession in recent months, winning both South Africa's Joburg Open and, more recently, Malaysia's Maybank Championship. Sharma poses with the Maybank Championship trophy in February 2018.Those victories have placed him on the fringes of the top 50 in the official world golf rankings, made him his country's youngest golfer to win on the European Tour by six years, and put him in pole position in the season-long Race to Dubai.But the best could be yet to come. While the headlines will naturally focus on a resurgent Tiger Woods, Sharma has received a special invitation to play in this year's Masters, crowning a remarkable rise from the Asian Development Tour to the game's most prestigious event. \"I always knew that I would get here and I've always believed in my ability, but I never knew I was going to get here so fast,\" Sharma tells CNN Sport ahead of the tournament, which takes place from 5-8 April. \"Things have changed for me so much; I would never have thought in my wildest dreams I'd be playing the Masters this year.\" JUST WATCHEDGolf in India: The growth of the gameReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHGolf in India: The growth of the game 22:29Sharma isn't short of confidence.\"I absolutely believe I can win,\" he says. \"Obviously there's a lot of pressure and a lot of people, but at the end of the day you're just playing golf. \"I'll just try to play the course; that's my objective for the tournament.

Meanwhile the secretary general of the Women's Golf Association of India, Champika Nanda Sayal, believes there's \"a fear\" that the game is too difficult and has too many rules. A seismic shiftIn a land mainly in thrall to bat and ball, Sharma is the first to acknowledge most people \"didn't really know what golf was\" a decade ago.But, as the young man from Chandigarh contends, things are changing ... fast.\"If you'd seen about 15, 20 years ago, things were a lot different,\" says Sharma. \"Sport was pretty much cricket.

Sharma ultimately fell back to 10-under-par, tying for seventh position in what was his PGA Tour debut, but \"Lefty\" will certainly know all about him now. Asked about what Sharma could mean for Indian golf ahead of the Masters, Mickelson told reporters: \"I think the growth potential in that country is enormous, and what he's doing to help grow the game could well be similar to what Tiger has done to grow the game in the US and world.\"And he's not the only one already looking to the future. \"He probably thought we were media and said, 'Not right now.

High-speed Thalys trains towards Belgium and the Netherlands were operating almost as normal, but there were no services towards Switzerland, Spain or Italy.French railway workers attend a protest in Bordeaux on Tuesday.Tuesday's walkout -- dubbed \"Black Tuesday\" by the French media -- comes less than two weeks after a nationwide strike across the public and transport sectors as workers protested the government's proposed labor overhauls, including the plans to open the SNCF to competition.   Unions have called for the \"strongest possible\" strike to protest proposed reforms that they believe would lead to the privatization of the railways, and to call for higher wages and an end to precarious jobs. The government said there were no plans to privatize SNCF, which is 45 billion euros ($56 billion) in debt, according to Reuters.Read More\"We're striking for several reasons, but at the top of the list is the government wanting to open up the service to competition,\" the spokesman for rail union Sud Rail, Eric Santinelli, told CNN. \"They don't want to do it in a progressive manner, they want to do it in an accelerated manner.\"Both sides have made it clear that they will not concede, and each sees the strikes as a test of their resolve and credibility. The government believes it is acting with a mandate for change, but the unions have always succeeded in making the government back down. JUST WATCHEDWhy are the French always striking?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhy are the French always striking? 01:37The walkout, which began at 7 p.m. local time Monday and will end at 8 a.m. Thursday, is the first of 18 two-day walkouts planned before the end of June. The next is scheduled for April 8-9. In an IFOP poll published Sunday in the Journal du Dimanche newspaper, 53% of the nearly 1,000 people surveyed said the strike was unjustified. Other sectors could join the strike as it continues in protest at broader changes to labor laws proposed by Macron.Unions fear that if Macron triumphs in the rail dispute, he could soon push through controversial reforms in areas such as education and pensions.Air France workers also walked out Tuesday in a separate and continuing dispute over pay, leading to the cancellation of around 25% of flights. Three further strike days are planned in the next ten days.A passenger crosses the tracks at Gare de Lyon train station in Paris on Tuesday.Poll: French divided over reformsAfter winning 66% of the vote in a run-off with far-right candidate Marine Le Pen in last year's presidential election, Macron claimed a mandate to overhaul France's labor laws, the raison d'\u00eatre of his candidacy. His pledge echoed the promises of several previous French presidents, none of whom were able to implement the changes due to strong union opposition.Macron's labor reform plans face first big test, a strikeIn a series of five executive orders last August, Macron laid out his goals: to give companies more flexibility in hiring and firing workers, more power to negotiate working conditions directly with employees, and less financial risk in cases of wrongful dismissals.While French business leaders and economists welcomed the plans, several unions have strongly criticized the proposals. Recent polls also show that support for Macron among voters has fallen since his election, which could weaken his position in the dispute.Just over half (51%) of those surveyed in Sunday's IFOP poll said they support the reforms. Macron's plan to turn the state-owned SNCF into a profit-making business has raised particular concerns among its employees, who fear they could lose job-for-life guarantees, annual pay rises and the right to early retirement. Union bosses have also expressed concern that increasing the competitiveness of the railways could mean increased ticket prices for travelers.'This type of competition is savage'France's transport minister Elisabeth Borne said there were no plans to privatize SNCF and suggested that opening up the country's high-speed trains to competition would mean \"more trains, new services, cheaper tickets.\"\"This reform is necessary for travelers, necessary for the SNCF, necessary for the railway workers,\" she told CNN's affiliate BFM TV on Tuesday.Borne also said she was looking for dialogue with the unions, a claim that Santinelli, the rail union spokesman, disputed. \"The reality is she wants to create a law which opens us up to competition and it is out of the question that we will write a law that includes that,\" he told CNN.\"Our vision is of a railway system offering a public service. She's suggesting private companies that will use the SNCF personnel; this type of competition is savage and it's unacceptable.\"   A man wearing a jacket reading \"angry railway worker on strike\" at a Marseille train station on Tuesday.The French government has been trying to push through changes to labor laws for decades, with one of the strongest drives coming in 1995. Then-Prime Minister Alain Juppe had proposed restructuring SNCF and raising the retirement age for train drivers.He was forced to concede after the country's unions sent thousands to the streets in demonstrations and, in the minds of many, turned the protest movement into a battle for the soul of the country, winning widespread public support. The railway workers leading the charge this time do not appear to have the same level of public backing, but Santinelli is optimistic.\"Either the government starts really negotiating or we'll just keep on going,\" he said.CNN's Melissa Bell contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)The British government repeated its claim that Russia was responsible for the Salisbury poisoning after UK scientists said they were unable to determine where the substance used to attack former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia was made.Skripal, 66, and Yulia, 33, were poisoned on March 4 after being exposed to a nerve agent in Salisbury, England. The pair were found slumped on a bench in an outdoor shopping complex after the attack with no visible injuries, according to police. The nerve agent had been placed on Sergei Skripal's front door, police said. JUST WATCHEDWhat is Novichok and how does it kill?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhat is Novichok and how does it kill? 01:34Speaking to Sky News on Tuesday, Gary Aitkenhead, chief executive of Porton Down laboratory, said the poisonous substance used to carry out the attack was the military-grade nerve agent Novichok but said scientists did not identify where it was manufactured.\"We have not identified the precise source, but we have provided the scientific info to government, who have then used a number of other sources to piece together the conclusions you have come to,\" Aitkenhead said.He added: \"It is our job to provide the scientific evidence of what this particular nerve agent is. We identified that it is from this particular family and that it is a military grade, but it is not our job to say where it was manufactured.\"Police officers stand outside former Russian spy Sergei Skripal's home.Read MoreA UK government spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday: \"We have been clear from the very beginning that our world-leading experts at Porton Down identified the substance used in Salisbury as a Novichok, a military grade nerve agent.\"This is only one part of the intelligence picture. As the Prime Minister has set out in a number of statements to the Commons since 12 March, this includes our knowledge that within the last decade, Russia has investigated ways of delivering nerve agents probably for assassination -- and as part of this program has produced and stockpiled small quantities of Novichoks; Russia's record of conducting state-sponsored assassinations; and our assessment that Russia views former intelligence officers as targets.\"Russian President Vladimir Putin rebuffed the UK's claims at a news conference with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara on Tuesday, referencing Porton Down's assessment.Putin said there were 20 countries that could manufacture the nerve agent, adding he was \"surprised at the speed with which the anti-Russian campaign was promoted and accelerated.\"Growing tensionsThe UK government has long pointed fingers at Russia for the attack against the former double agent and his daughter on British soil. On Monday, a source briefed on the investigation told CNN that British authorities believe the location of the attack on Skripal's door shows a sophistication that likely had the approval of the Kremlin. British officials said they believe an attack of this type could only be carried out by someone with key training involving Novichok, a chemical developed by Russia during the Cold War.There are doubts that rogue agents could have carried out the attack without approval from the top levels of Russian government.Earlier on Tuesday, a Downing Street spokesman said the UK is responding \"in a proportionate way\" to Russian aggression. He added that challenges posed by Russia \"will last for years.\"Downing Street's statement comes after Evgeny Buzhinsky, a former Russian general, told British media the diplomatic fallout from the poisoning could get \"worse than the Cold War\" and trigger a \"real war.\"More than 20 nations, including the United States, have backed Britain by expelling over 100 Russian diplomats after the UK government openly blamed Moscow for the Salisbury incident.Russia and the US can replace expelled diplomats Russia has repeatedly denied involvement in the poisoning, with Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova last week accusing the UK government of seeking to \"bring about a totally absurd situation.\"The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons told CNN an emergency meeting will be held on Wednesday at Russia's request. The Russian Embassy in the UK released a statement on Sunday posing a series of questions to the organization about its knowledge of the investigation.As the fallout from the incident continues, both Skripal and his daughter remain hospitalized in Salisbury. A statement from Salisbury District Hospital last week said Yulia Skripal was \"improving rapidly\" and that Sergei Skripal remains in critical but stable condition.

Zakharova told reporters in Moscow that Britain is breaking international law by refusing to provide information on the case.\"We are witnessing obvious prevention of access for Russian representatives to Russian victims,\" she said.On Tuesday, a spokesperson for the UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office reiterated it was considering requests for consular access in line with its obligations under international and domestic law, which include the rights and wishes of Yulia Skripal.CNN's Jim Sciutto, Euan McKirdy and James Grey contributed to this report.",

For Emirates Team New Zealand, there was really only one option.Instead of the twin-hulled foiling catamarans that competed at last year's America's Cup finals on the Great Sound of Bermuda, the 36th edition of the 167-year-old competition will be staged in 75ft yachts capable of lifting out of the water on two large canting foils with an additional foil on the rudder.Read More Photos: Emirates Team New Zealand, helmed by Peter Burling, celebrate after winning the America's Cup Match in Hamilton, Bermuda.Hide Caption 1 of 5 Photos: Burling, at the age of 26, becomes the youngest winning helmsman in the history of the America's Cup.Hide Caption 2 of 5 Photos: Fans young and old gathered at the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron in Auckland to watch and, eventually, celebrate.Hide Caption 3 of 5 Photos: New Zealand sealed an 7-1 triumph with victory in Monday's ninth race of the final match.Hide Caption 4 of 5 Photos: The racing took place on the waters of Bermuda's Great Sound.Hide Caption 5 of 5READ: America's Cup-winning skipper jumps ship to ItaliansMonohullAlthough the huge aerodynamic wing sails used in Bermuda will be making way for more traditional soft sails, the 2021 America's Cup yachts may be the fastest sailing boats ever built, capable of reaching top speeds of more than 50 knots (57mph). \"We've decided to go for the monohull and basically push the concept of the monohull as far as we can,\" Dan Bernasconi, technical director of Emirates Team New Zealand, told CNN's Main Sail.\"We don't want to throw away foiling, everyone loves it, but we want to see how we can bring that to monohull,\" said Bernasconi, who worked with the McLaren Formula One team for six years before he made the switch to sailing. \"It's really exciting for the design team and the sailors to have a completely new type of boat to sail.\"JUST WATCHEDAmerica's Cup: Dramatic capsizing Team NZReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAmerica's Cup: Dramatic capsizing Team NZ 01:06READ: America's Cup -- sailing's money menDemonsHaving conquered the demons of the 2013 Cup, when the Kiwis blew an 8-1 lead against eventual winners Team Oracle USA in San Francisco, with an emphatic 7-1 win in Bermuda, the team are now focused on retaining the Auld Mug in front of a sailing-mad home crowd in 2021. \"The boats are going to be ballasted, so they'll be heavier than a multihull,\" Bernasconi said. \"And you won't be foiling in all wind conditions, so there is a really important transition of who can actually get up out of the water and that brings hull design back into the America's Cup, which is really exciting.\"The switch back to the more traditional America's Cup monohull class was partly driven by the location of the 2021 finals, which will be held in Hauraki Gulf off Auckland.\"There is no doubt the cats are cool, but basically Bermuda was a lake,\" Grant Dalton, Emirates Team New Zealand chief executive officer, said. \"Hauraki Gulf is not a lake.

I wouldn't want it any other way.\"The oldest of the Campbell sisters -- there is also the youngest sister Abigail and a brother Hamish, who suffers from cerebral palsy -- knows the spotlight will firmly be on her and Bronte at their home Games.Read MoreAt the Rio Olympics in 2016, Cate was deemed by many a shoo-in for gold in the 100 meter freestyle but, having set Olympic records in the preceding two rounds, faded badly in the final and finished sixth.\"It's strange as in that moment my world stopped but everything around me kept moving. They blew the whistle and I had to get out of the pool, I went to warm down and had dinner.\"Life was happening whatever the result and I could either wallow in it or move on. As a swimmer, you work out the worst-case scenario and this was the rock bottom I was afraid of. Swimming, to which I'd given so much, had broken my heart.\"JUST WATCHEDAthletes take the CNN Commonwealth Games QuizReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAthletes take the CNN Commonwealth Games Quiz 02:12READ: Queen Elizabeth's 'secret message in a bottle'Olympic goldFor months, Cate was too ashamed and embarrassed about her shortcomings in the pool, unable even to talk about it with Bronte, with whom she had shared a house for three years.\"Giving her space was my strategy,\" says Bronte. \"She was very upset after Rio and needed to work through that in her own time. She's come through that and is loving the sport again.\"The Australian public assumed that it was Olympic heartache too for the younger of the two swimming siblings but, having been injured in the build-up to the Games, Bronte had relished the Rio de Janeiro experience.\"Most people expect me to say my experience in Rio was quite negative,\" says the 23-year-old Bronte. \"But Rio was good considering my lead-up. A lot of people thought I'd be upset, that I had expectations to do better but I still ended up with an Olympic gold medal.\"That's a reference to the sisters spearheading Australia to glory in the 4x100m freestyle relay, although Bronte admits 18 months on there is some element of what might have been at Rio.\"It's frustrating as I know if I hadn't been injured I could have done more,\" she explains.

However ...Golden State WarriorsWarriors forward Kevin Durant missed time late in the regular season with a rib injury.... While the Warriors' lineup is packed full of stars, there is reason to worry: injuries. Stephen Curry has had ankle and knee problems, and head coach Steve Kerr has said he's ruling him out of the first round.Additionally, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala all have missed games because of varying maladies.The Warriors undoubtedly are a favorite to reach the NBA Finals, which would make it the fourth consecutive season.

But it's been an unsteady year for Cleveland.The question is how the Cavaliers will respond in the playoffs after a roller coaster regular season. They can score, but their defense hasn't been good. How will they hold up against playoff teams?Just four players remain from Cleveland's title team from 2016: James, Kevin Love, JR Smith and Tristan Thompson.

The buzz still was palpable in Oakland, California, as 14,644 fans turned up at the ballpark to see the rookie known as the Japanese Babe Ruth.They steadied their cell phones to get images of him, while others held up his Los Angeles Angels jersey and signs written in Japanese.Follow @cnnsport\n\nAccording to MLB.com, 240 members of the Japanese media were in attendance.  Fans tuned in from Japan local time at 5 a.m.For Shohei Ohtani, it was showtime.In elite companyRead MoreIt's been estimated that Ohtani's value could be worth as much as $200 million, though the Angels are only paying the Japanese star the league-minimum salary of $545,000 per year due to the MLB's collective bargaining rules. Ohtani, however, did pocket a one-time signing bonus of $2.3 million. While the cameras clicked and mobile phones were trained on Ohtani, the 23-year-old member of the Angels, who had made his major league debut on Thursday as a designated hitter, took the pitching mound for his first major league start.Ohtani is attempting to do what many think is impossible: play in Major League Baseball doing both.On Thursday, Ohtani singled in his first at-bat, going 1-for-5 at the plate. He joined Hideki Matsui, Kaz Matsui, Tsuyoshi Shinjo and Kosuke Fukudome as Japanese-born players with a hit on Opening Day in their first MLB at-bat.Then came Sunday, putting Ohtani in some elite company.Ohtani singled in his first major league at-bat on Thursday.He became the first Major League player to start as a non-pitcher on Opening Day and then start as a pitcher within his team's first 10 games since Ruth -- the most famous two-way player of all -- did it with the Boston Red Sox in 1919.And after Ruth, it's been a rare occurrence.The last time a player started as a pitcher and a non-pitcher in the first 10 games of a season was 1920, when both Joe Bush (Red Sox) and Clarence Mitchell (Dodgers) started as pitchers and outfielders. The last player to start as a pitcher and a non-pitcher within the same season was Rick Rhoden with the Yankees in 1988 (30 starts as pitcher, one as DH).\"He was attacking the hitters\"Ohtani got off to a rough start against the Athletics, giving up three hits, including a three-run home run to Matt Chapman, in the second inning.\"After that three-run shot, (Angels manager Mike) Scioscia came up to me and said I'm doing fine,\" Ohtani said through his interpreter. \"Don't let them score from here on out.\"And Ohtani settled down. In all, he allowed three runs and three hits with one walk in six innings, striking out six. At times, his speed got up to 100 miles per hour on the radar gun.\"I knew he was going to have a good one because the way he was throwing the ball was amazing,\" Angels catcher Martin Maldonado said. \"He was attacking the hitters.\"Ohtani earned his first win as the Angels came out on top, 7-4.\"Obviously I'm very happy, satisfied with my outing,\" Ohtani said. \"But more than that, happy the team got the victory.\"On this day, at least, he lived up to the hype.",

        "content": "(CNN)British authorities examining the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal believe the daring placement of the nerve agent on his door shows a sophistication that likely had the approval of the Kremlin, a source briefed on the investigation has confirmed to CNN. Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were poisoned on March 4 after being exposed to what the British government says was a military-grade nerve agent.British officials believe an attack of this type could only be carried out by a person (or more than one person) with key training involving Novichok, the substance used in the attack. There are doubts that rogue agents could have carried out the attack without approval from the top levels of Russian government.  Police officers stand outside the home of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal following his alleged poisoning.The New York Times first reported this latest theory regarding responsibility.Read MoreLast week, Russia again denied any involvement in the poisoning, with Russian Foreign Minister spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accusing the UK government of seeking to \"bring about a totally absurd situation.\"Opinion: Putin won't care about the expulsion of diplomatsBlameThe UK government has long pointed fingers at Russia for the March 4 nerve agent attack against the former double agent and his daughter on British soil. In a speech before parliament one week after the attack, British Prime Minister Theresa May said it was \"highly likely\" that the attack constituted \"an unlawful use of force by the Russian state against the United Kingdom.\"Officials believe this type of nerve agent attack is also meant to send a strong warning to Russian dissidents in the West, the source said. Yulia Skripal in an image taken from her Facebook account on Tuesday March 6, 2018The revelation that investigators believe the poisoning likely had approval at the highest levels of the Russian government doubles down on accusations -- from the White House, among others -- that Russia is becoming increasingly brazen in its hostile acts on foreign governments, including its interference in the 2016 US presidential election. The assertion that the Kremlin's fingerprints are on the attack echoes what the US said regarding the 2016 hacking of the Democratic National Committee blamed on hackers tied to Russian intelligence.The Kremlin has also denied being involved in the DNC hacking.UK told to pull more diplomatic staff from RussiaRecoveryBoth Skripal and his daughter were hospitalized for weeks with serious damage from the attack, but Yulia is \"improving rapidly,\" a statement from the Salisbury District Hospital last week said. Sergei Skripal remains in a critical but stable condition, the statement added.Late last week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov again demanded the UK give Russian diplomats access to Yulia, who is a Russian citizen. Zakharova also told reporters in Moscow that Britain is breaking international law by refusing to provide information on the case.\"We are witnessing obvious prevention of access for Russian representatives to Russian victims,\" she said.The Skripals were found slumped on a bench in an outdoor shopping complex in Salisbury, England. They had no visible injuries, according to police. Opinion: If we want to stop Putin, we need to go after his sources of moneyTit-for-tat expulsionsThe flag of the United States flies outside the US Consulate building in St. Petersburg ahead of its announced closure by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.The diplomatic fallout continued last week as Moscow ordered the expulsion of diplomats from at least 23 countries, as a reciprocal move after those countries expelled Russian diplomats in solidarity with the UK. Prior to Friday's expulsions, the Kremlin announced that 60 US diplomats would be kicked out of the country, and the US consulate in St. Petersburg shut in retaliation for a similar step by Washington, which said Monday it would be expelling the same number of Russian diplomats and closing the Russian consulate in Seattle.CNN's Jim Sciutto reported from Washington DC, Euan McKirdy wrote in Hong Kong.",

To Player, it always will.Read More\"The fact is, Arnold was not happy for me,\" Player told CNN Sport, when asked if Palmer was magnanimous in defeat. \"He struggled to really congratulate Jack [Nicklaus] or myself whenever we beat him.

Player had swashbuckled his way to a four-stroke lead after 54 holes, but a sketchy back nine on Monday (play had been washed out on Sunday), including a seven at the par-five 13th, had handed Palmer the initiative. After his approach at 18, Palmer accepted a congratulatory handshake from a friend in the gallery, only to discover his ball had finished in the sand. Palmer eventually got down in double-bogey six, handing Player -- who got up and down from the very same bunker for a par -- the tournament by a single shot.\"Arnold was becoming an American icon, was the defending champion, and there had been no back-to-back winner of the Masters,\" says the 82-year-old South African, the first non-American to win the tournament and whose only supporters that day were his wife Vivienne, a few friends and his dog.\"He was 'their' guy and nobody gave me a chance. Nobody except my family and a few friends really cared. But I was sure I was going to win, and the more they cheered for him, the more determined I would become. \"Only Arnold knows what was going through his mind when he started celebrating before it was all over. But I thrived on being the underdog. \"I took down Arnold Palmer in his home country against all the odds.\"Player calls his memories \"the cushions of life,\" which might explain why he's such a splendidly sprightly octogenarian, who still does thousands of sit-ups a day and could do plenty of damage with one of his trademark kung fu kicks.

Roberts replied: \"Tell him to pack his bags.\"\"I don't know if it's the smell or how every little detail is taken into account,\" says Player, \"but I felt compelled to stop at the top of Magnolia Lane and just walk down by myself. Gratitude filled my heart. No doubt, this was a monumental challenge. \"But I came to the Masters to win, to become a world champion. And if you want to be a champion, you cannot be intimidated.\"     Player finished tied for 24th in his first Masters and won the first of three Open Championships in 1959, before that first victory in Augusta two years later. \"I cherish everything about [his 1961 Masters win] to this day.

The couple have tasked London florist Philippa Craddock with decorating St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, where the wedding is set to take place on May 19.Craddock's team plans to use white garden roses, peonies and foxgloves, as well as branches of beech, birch and hornbeam for the chapel's floral displays.Florist Philippa Craddock owns a flower shop at Selfridges Department Store in central London.Many of the plants will be sourced from the gardens and parkland of the royally-owned Crown Estate and Windsor Great Park.\"Where possible, Philippa will use flowers and plants that are in season and blooming naturally in May,\" Kensington Palace said in a statement released Saturday. Read MoreAfter the wedding, the flowers will be distributed to local charities. Self-taught florist Craddock has been in the business nine years, with past clients including the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, Hampton Court Palace, and designers Alexander McQueen and Christian Dior.More wedding details revealed Last week, the royal couple revealed that pastry chef Claire Ptak, who was raised in California and now owns London-based bakery Violet Cakes, would be creating their wedding cake. Claire Ptak, owner of Violet Bakery in east London, has been chosen to make the couple's wedding cake.According to the palace, the couple asked Ptak to make a \"lemon elderflower cake that will incorporate the bright flavours of spring\" rather than the more traditional fruitcake. It will also feature buttercream and fresh flowers as decoration.More than 2,600 people, many of them ordinary members of the public, will be invited into the castle grounds to watch the arrival of the bride and groom and their guests.Last month, the royal family revealed the route of the procession following the ceremony, when the newlyweds first emerge as husband and wife.They will leave Windsor Castle in a carriage and travel along High Street through the town of Windsor, before returning to the castle by the Long Walk, according to the palace. Windsor is about 40 km (25 miles) west of central London.'This crazy journey together'Prince Harry and Markle announced their engagement in November, when Harry told reporters he knew Markle, an American actress, was \"the one\" from \"the very first time we met.\"\n\n\n\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, Markle said the couple first met in July 2016 on a blind date set up by a mutual friend. After a second date, the couple took a camping trip to Botswana, where they could finally be alone.\"We were able to really have so much time just to connect,\" Markle said, \"and we never went longer than two weeks without seeing each other, even though we were obviously doing a long-distance relationship. We made it work.\"Harry proposed on a \"cozy night\" in early November at Nottingham Cottage, Markle told the BBC, with an engagement ring he designed himself. It features a diamond from Botswana, flanked by two smaller diamonds from the jewelry collection of Princess Diana, Harry's mother, who died in 1997.CNN's Carol Jordan and Lauren Kent contributed to this report",

He had maintained his innocence since his arrest in November 2017.Rashid wrote messages online encouraging militants to carry out attacks, including posting a picture of Prince George -- son of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and third in line to the throne -- next to a superimposed silhouette of a jihadi fighter, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said.He also gave the full address of the young prince's school in southwest London, which the boy began attending last September, and wrote: \"even the royal family will not be left alone.\"Prince George arrives for his first day of school with his father Prince William on September 7.All of the offenses relate to Rashid's online activities between October 2016 and November 2017, the CPS said.

He had also provided information about how to shoot down aircraft and jam missile systems to an individual already in Syria, according to the CPS.Following Rashid's revised plea, Judge Andrew Lees said the trial had heard the \"most disturbing allegations\" and told Rashid a very lengthy prison sentence was \"inevitable\" and a life sentence would be considered, according to PA.",

        "content": "Rome (CNN)In a remarkable case of political deja vu, Italy's President has appointed Giuseppe Conte, a law professor and political novice, as the country's new prime minister, the secretary of the presidential palace announced Thursday.President Sergio Mattarella approved Conte's appointment last week -- but the next day rejected the politician's choice of finance minister, forcing Conte, 53, to abandon his attempt to form a government.Thursday's announcement came a few hours after the right-wing League and anti-establishment Five Star Movement -- the two largest parties after the federal election in March -- said they reached an agreement to form a coalition government, signaling a possible end to the country's months-long political uncertainty. Conte was summoned to the Quirinale, Italy's presidential palace, Thursday evening, and his appointment announced shortly afterward. The President has also approved a list of cabinet ministers brought by Conte to the palace. \"We will work intensely to realize the political goals of our agreement, and we will work with determination to improve the lives of all Italians,\" Conte said after reading the list of confirmed ministers.Read MoreNew Interior Minister tells immigrants: 'Go home!!!'News of Conte's appointment came soon after Carlo Cottarelli, a former official at the International Monetary Fund who was asked by President Sergio Mattarella to form an interim government earlier this week, relinquished his mandate to make way for Conte. \"A political government is by far the best solution for the country,\" Cottarelli said after handing his resignation to the President. \"It avoids the uncertainty of new elections.\"Political unknown appointed Italy's new prime ministerBut a populist, euroskeptic government in Europe's fourth-largest economy will likely be met with alarm by other European leaders, most notably French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who are both eager to push for further EU political and economic integration.The League has also faced widespread criticism for xenophobic, anti-immigrant policies reminiscent of those forwarded by far-right parties across Europe, including Germany's AfD and France's National Front.Just hours before his party announced it would be forming a coalition government, League leader Matteo Salvini posted a video on Facebook appearing to show a man of African origin plucking a pigeon, with the words, \"Go home!!!\"Salvini, who promised during the election campaign to expel half a million illegal immigrants from Italy, is Italy's new interior minister, while Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio will become labor and economic development minister, a key position to fulfill his campaign promise of a universal basic income.League leader Matteo Salvini celebrates after a strong result in federal elections in March.The League and Five Star proposed a government led by Conte last week. But Mattarella objected to Conte's choice for the finance ministry, euroskeptic economist Paolo Savona, saying it would alarm investors and have dangerous consequences for Italy's outstanding government debt.On Thursday's visit to the presidential palace, Conte instead proposed Giovanna Tria as finance minister. Tria has been critical of Germany's role in Europe but, unlike Savona, has never expressed the desire to leave the single currency. Savona will enter the government as minister for European affairs.The country's new government is scheduled to be sworn in Friday at 4 p.m. (10 a.m. ET), an event likely to trigger reverberations across Italy. Rallies in support of Mattarella had been planned in Rome and Milan for Friday, while Five Star had planned a protest in Rome Sunday, originally to call for the president's impeachment. It is likely that Italians will still take to the streets this weekend, either to celebrate or to demonstrate against the populist coalition.A new European crisis?Italy has not had a government since it went to the polls in March, the longest such period in the country's postwar history.Italy's political chaos is more dangerous than BrexitSince the vote, Five Star leader Di Maio and Salvini, the League leader, were locked in talks with Mattarella and struggled to form a government.During the negotiations, the populists ditched some of their most incendiary campaign vows, such as calling for a referendum on whether Italy should abandon the euro or leave the European Union.Instead they promised a spending and tax-cutting binge that has rattled investors and could contain the seeds of a new European crisis.Tensions have also risen between the two parties and the President, peaking as Di Maio called for Mattarella's impeachment earlier this week following his rejection of Conte's choice of finance minister.Conte: A political unknownBorn in the southern region of Puglia, Conte lives in Florence where he teaches civil law at the University of Florence.Italy's next government is Europe's next crisisWhen he joined the Five Star Movement during the recent election, he said he supported center-left political ideals. He was mentioned as a potential Public Administration minister in the event that the Five Star Movement won a clear majority.Conte's first nomination as prime minister was briefly called into question after media reports accused him of embellishing parts of his curriculum vitae. Efforts to reach Conte for comment were unsuccessful.He studied in the United Kingdom and United States, according to his resume, where he perfected his English in order to teach international law. The Five Star movement rejected accusations that Conte embellished his qualifications.\"There's no reference (in his CV) to masters or other university titles, but the simple and accurate description of his work as a scholar and university professor,\" the movement said in a post on its official blog.Livia Borghese reported from Rome and Judith Vonberg wrote from London.

That means 180 of parliament's 350 members, a clear majority, will voice their lack of confidence in the leader.Rajoy's Popular Party has been plagued with corruption allegations for years. Rajoy has faced the humiliation of testifying in cases against members of his party, though he has not been among the accused.The confidence motion was filed by Pedro Sanchez, the leader of the main opposition Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, after a court convicted Rajoy's former aides of running slush funds to help finance Popular Party election campaigns. The court also questioned the credibility of Rajoy's testimony during the proceedings. Members of parliament can also approve Sanchez to take over as prime minister in Friday's vote.

Follow @cnnsport\n\nThe Derby, first staged in 1780, is the pinnacle of European Flat racing and comes with a hefty dose of folklore and a chunky first prize of \u00a3920,000 ($1.23M).But that's just small beer compared with the riches on offer for the winner at stud. And if that winner happens to be the favorite Saxon Warrior, it could unlock a treasure trove for owner Coolmore, the Ireland-based breeding operation which has Ballydoyle as its racing arm.A Derby win to back up the 2,000 Guineas victory in May, allied to his exceptional pedigree out of Japanese Triple Crown winner Deep Impact and champion mare Maybe, could render Saxon Warrior virtually priceless. \"You've got the odds-on favorite Saxon Warrior, who is already worth a fortune, and you've got the rest of the field,\" Tom Goff, of leading consultancy Blandford Bloodstock, told CNN Sport. Read More\"Whatever the rest of them do they're worth \u00a310-15 million but Saxon Warrior is such an exceptionally well-bred horse that if he wins he's probably worth in excess of \u00a340-50 million.\"Saxon Warrior is favorite to add the Derby to his 2,000 Guineas win.Should he add the St Leger in September to become the first horse since Nijinsky in 1970 to win British racing's Triple Crown, he would seal his status as an \"utterly unique racehorse,\" adds Goff.\"He has a very strong blend of Danehill, Galileo and Deep Impact in him,\" said his trainer Aidan O'Brien, who has saddled six Derby winners. \"Those three strong traits make him a horse we haven't had before, so he is very different.\"But should another horse triumph over the tough mile-and-a-half Derby course on the Epsom Downs south of London -- a test which requires both speed and stamina -- a lucrative career at stud still beckons. (Only six fillies have won the Derby, the last in 1916). \"The great Italian breeder Tesio said more than 50 years ago that the winning post at Epsom determines the future of the thoroughbred and it stands true today,\" says Sam Bullard, director of stallions at Dalham Hall Stud in Newmarket, the Darley stud operation of Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin racing outfit.

So far this century, horses have gone to stud with fees ranging from 8,000 euros to 85,000 euros (\u00a37000-\u00a374,000), with prices dependent on their results, according to Bullard.  \"The horses with the best stud fees are those who go on to become the champion of their generation and they would usually have the Derby on their CV,\" Bullard tells CNN Sport.But he adds: \"The day the horse leaves the racecourse is the end of his career and his future is entirely determined by the success of his progeny.\"Take his star stallion Dubawi, son of champion miler Dubai Millenium, a favorite of Sheikh Mohammed. His racing career was impressive rather than stellar, with two Group 1 wins and a second as a three-year-old, including victory in the Irish 2000 Guineas, alongside third in the Derby behind Motivator in 2005.READ: Why Winx is a racing superstar A son of Dubawi and Pacifique sold for a record 2.6 million euros at the Deauville sales in 2015.Don't forget MomBut it was what happened later that bumped up his stud fee from an initial \u00a325,000 to an eye-watering \u00a3250,000 a pop. Standing at Dalham Hall Stud in Newmarket, UK, he is the fastest ever to sire to 50 Group winners -- the top level of horse races -- and has bred horses such as Dubai World Cup winner Monterosso and 2000 Guineas champions Makfi and Night of Thunder. \"He's the best,\" says Bullard. \"He got off to an unbelievable start at stud and has produced more offspring that are Group 1 winners at this stage of his career than any other horse.The aim for Bullard's team to is to get about 140 mares a year in foal by Dubawi. Last year his crop of yearlings averaged \u00a3860,000 ($1.15M) each. In 2016 a Dubawi colt out of Fallen for You achieved 2.6 million guineas (\u00a32.73M, $3.6M) at the Tattersalls yearling sales.\"We mustn't forget the female side in a Derby winner,\" adds Bullard. \"It has a huge amount of influence on the horse's value when he retires to stud, because, to put it bluntly, your mum's half the battle.\"READ: Meet the world's tallest and smallest horsesJUST WATCHEDWinx's journey to 25: Queen Elizabeth StakesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWinx's journey to 25: Queen Elizabeth Stakes 22:20The Lionel Messi of studDubawi's offspring have so far won more than \u00a321 million in prize money on the Flat alone, according to the Racing Post. Breeding the next generation of thoroughbred champions is the cash-converting game. \"We want the Lionel Messi of the covering shed,\" says Bullard. \"And when he's gone we'll want the next one, that's what it's all about.\"But perhaps Europe's current \"Messi\" is the legendary Galileo, who stands at the Coolmore stud in County Tipperary, Ireland.He won the Epsom Derby, the Irish Derby and the King George in impressive times, but has gone on to sire more than 70 Group 1 winners including the unbeaten Frankel and Derby winners New Approach, Australia and Ruler of the World. He also sired the dam of Saxon Warrior.Such is his prowess at stud, although his fees are undisclosed, reports suggest the figure is in excess of 500,00 euros ($584,200). A Galileo filly out of multiple winner Dank achieved 4 million guineas (\u00a34.2M, $5.6M) at last October's Tattersalls yearling sales.\"He's the best stallion in Europe and in some years is arguably the best stallion in the world,\" says Goff.READ: Justify wins Preakness, sets up Triple Crown bidFrankel romped home in style to win the 2,000 Guineas in 2011. Frankel's futurePerhaps the new kid on the breeding block is Frankel, who was unbeaten in 14 starts, including the 2,000 Guineas in 2011, in a remarkable racing career. Despite not running in the Derby, he amassed nearly \u00a33 million in prize funds.The pride of the late trainer Sir Henry Cecil, Frankel retired to Banstead Manor Stud at Cheveley in Suffolk, part of Prince Khalid bin Abdullah's Juddmonte Farms breeding operation.His initial fee was \u00a3125,000, but this has risen to \u00a3175,000, largely off the back of Cracksman, who was the world's top-rated three-year-old and has won more than \u00a31.3 million.Frankel is still awaiting a Classic winner, but his progeny is starting to make \"enormous numbers at sales,\" according to Goff. When one of his offspring does land a Classic, his future earnings will skyrocket. \"Frankel is an anomaly. He was the most wonderful racehorse and he caught the imagination like no others,\" added Bullard.  However, not all champion colts become successful sires. Godolphin's Barney Roy, who the St James' Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot and was second in the 2000, was found be infertile at stud, says Bullard.\"There are stallions that have fertility issues, other stallions have an accident in the paddock, there are all sorts of things that can go wrong. There are stallions that don't have any winners and they fall off the radar very quickly,\" adds Bullard.\"It's a very small section of stallions that get to generate a huge stud fee.\"Visit CNN.com/horseracing for more new, features and videosThe Derby is the perfect shop window.

He put on a T-shirt that had been shot through to show bullet wounds and was then covered with pigs' blood.After his wife called emergency services, Babchenko said, he was transferred to an ambulance. \"Measures were taken to resuscitate me but it was not successful and I died, where the doctor established death.\"Babchenko was then taken to a morgue where he was \"still pretending to be dead,\" he said. Once he was inside the morgue and the doors were closed he \"came back to life.\" He then watched news reports about his death, \"what a great guy I was,\" he said.Read MoreA journalist reappears, and Russia cries foulThe 41-year-old journalist stunned observers when he showed up alive at a news conference on Wednesday -- a day after his reported killing -- to declare that his murder was faked by Ukrainian security services to foil an assassination plot against him.Answering questions Thursday about his staged killing, Babchenko again insisted that he had little choice after being presented by Ukrainian security services with details of the plot against his life.He also pushed back against criticism that he had undermined trust in journalism by participating in the operation, saying his aim was to keep himself and his family safe. \"I was thinking about my survival,\" he said, not journalistic ethics.While welcoming the fact he was alive, media outlets and the Committee to Protect Journalists, an international media watchdog, have raised questions over the ethics of the operation, its impact on public trust in the media and its potential exploitation by Russia.Arkady Babchenko, center, speaks to the media as Vasily Gritsak, head of the Ukrainian Security Service, left, and Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko attend a news conference Wednesday.In a Facebook post earlier Thursday, Babchenko ridiculed those who alleged that the Ukrainian authorities carried out the operation \"just for a laugh,\" saying that Ukraine was in a state of war and perpetual crisis.\"They [Ukrainian authorities] are all, like, 'We are kinda bored, we have nothing to do ... Let's paint Babchenko's back with blood, make his face a giant bloodclot, take him to the morgue and say that it was like that from the beginning?' And all these guys were like, 'Hell yeah, let's do it! Because we really have nothing else to do.'\" Babchenko, a critic of the Kremlin, added sarcastically: \"Well, okay, if it happened in Russia -- nothing there surprises me any more.\"The Russian journalist also hit out at press and others who questioned his journalistic ethics over the staged affair. Responding to a link to a roundup of UK newspaper headlines posted by a commenter, Babchenko said: \"Dear British press, please go f--- yourself. If you want to do good -- give me a UK passport and protection. Then you can teach me how to protect my family. F---ing smart---s.\"At Wednesday's news conference, Babchenko told reporters he'd had \"no choice but to cooperate\" with Ukrainian security services after they told him about the threat against him, and their elaborate plan to thwart it.He also apologized to his wife, Olechka -- who on Tuesday was reported to have found him bleeding to death at his apartment -- for the \"hell\" she had gone through.Staged 'murder' of Russian journalist comes at a heavy priceUkrainian security services have two suspects in custody in connection with the plot to murder Babchenko, Larisa Sargan, a spokeswoman for the Prosecutor General, told CNN on Wednesday. They are suspected of being the person who ordered the hit and the person who pulle the trigger.However, the Committee to Protect Journalists called Wednesday for Ukrainian authorities to disclose why an \"extreme measure\" such as staging Babchenko's murder was necessary.\"We are relieved that Arkady Babchenko is alive,\" said the watchdog's Europe and Central Asia program coordinator, Nina Ognianova, in a statement.\"Ukrainian authorities must now disclose what necessitated the extreme measure of staging news of the Russian journalist's murder. CPJ is investigating this unprecedented situation and will have no further comment until we have more details.\"The Russian government, meanwhile, accused the Ukrainian authorities of using Babchenko for anti-Russia propaganda purposes.\"That Babchenko is alive is the best news,\" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Facebook. \"Wish it was always like that. It's too bad that in other cases, the masquerade didn't quite come off.\"Senior Russian lawmaker Konstantin Kosachev compared the Babchenko case to the poisoning of a Russian former spy and his daughter in the UK, something used \"by hook or by crook to defame Russia.\"CNN's Nathan Hodge reported from Moscow and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.

        "content": "(CNN)Australian feminist Germaine Greer has sparked controversy by calling for the punishment for rape to be reduced and saying that most rapes are just bad sex.Speaking at the Hay literary festival in the UK, she said that society should not see rape as a \"spectacularly violent crime,\" suggesting that offenders should be sentenced to 200 hours' community service and perhaps an \"r\" tattoo on the rapist's hand, arm or cheek.\"Most rapes don't involve any injury whatsoever. We are told it's one of the most violent crimes in the world -- bull. Most rape is just lazy, just careless, just insensitive,\" she said, according to British press reports.\"Every time a man rolls over on his exhausted wife and insists on enjoying his conjugal right, he is raping her. It will never end up in a court of law,\" she added.\"It's an awful thing to be raped but to attempt to bring the person who raped you to justice and getting nowhere, getting discredited, getting humiliated, that's a tragedy.\" - @TheFemaleGreer #HayFestival2018\u2014 Hay Festival (@hayfestival) May 30, 2018\n\nGreer, 79, academic and author of the 1970 landmark feminist work \"The Female Eunuch,\" was speaking at the festival to publicize her new book, which is due out in Australia in September.Read MoreGreer has a long history of making incendiary remarks that have garnered her publicity.She has said that in her opinion transgender women are \"not women,\" female genital mutilation is like getting a tattoo and has slammed the #Metoo movement.During her Hay talk, Greer argued that rape is rampant in society because the legal system cannot cope with it and victims become little more than \"bits of evidence.\"\"I want to turn the discourse about rape upside down. We are not getting anywhere approaching it down the tunnel of history,\" she said.Former UK cabinet minister Priti Patel called Greer's views \"sickening.\"\"These comments are an affront to the victims of appalling crimes such as rape. We should have zero tolerance of sexual violence,\" she was quoted as saying by the Mail.Commentators expressed their disappointment at her comments on Twitter.  All this with Germaine Greer makes me very sad. Her comments are peculiar and damaging and the comments about her are foul and unhelpful. Hopefully it will raise the issue of sentencing of rapists, which needs addressing. Also trauma is a spectrum not an absolute to be denied.\u2014 Nicky Clark (@MrsNickyClark) May 31, 2018\n\nThe compassionate response to Germaine Greer is that demoting her own rape experience to 'bad sex' is her way of diminishing its effect on her. But in generalising this, and saying we should all think of rape this way, she fails to have any compassion for other rape victims.\u2014 Ros Barber (@rosbarber) May 31, 2018\n\nI call for Germaine Greer to stop calling herself a feminist. Because she very clearly isn't. And the hailing of her as one needs to stop. It should have stopped a long time ago, really, but now is certainly a good time to really do it. https://t.co/VZPOh2IiYP\u2014 Prof Tanja Bueltmann (@cliodiaspora) May 30, 2018\n\nGreer also spoke about her rape that was committed at a party days before her 19th birthday. She had not been \"angry enough\" with her attacker, she said.\"I can hear feminists screaming 'you're trivialising rape' but we shouldn't live in terror of the penis. Why are we genuflecting in front of this poor little thing that needs all the help it can get,\" she added.",

It means his ban will remain in place but crucially be delayed until after the tournament's conclusion in July. Guerrero thanked those that had supported his cause and expressed relief that the \"unjust sanction\" had been lifted, terming it \"at least partial justice.\"Read More\"Each and every one of my teammates have given me the strength necessary to overcome this difficult moment, but this doesn't surprise me, as that is how a family behaves and that is what we are,\" said the Peruvian captain.Peru players wore t-shirts proclaiming their support for Guerrero ahead of a friendly match against Scotland on May 29 in Lima.\n\"My eternal gratitude to my country, to the millions of compatriots that have united with me in thousands of different ways, with a common denominator: overwhelming affection. \"I invite you to remain united ...  As united Peruvians we can achieve anything that appears impossible.\"Guerrero, nicknamed the \"Warrior,\" went on to stress his quest to clear his name is just beginning. \"My battle continues and will continue to be carried out by my lawyers, whom I also thank,\" said the 34-year-old.   \"I pledge to give the greatest of my efforts to give new and greater joy to my country.

Fans of Peru display a banner in support of Paolo Guerrero.Guerrero, who plays for Brazilian team Flamengo, tested positive for the cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine in October 2017, a finding he claims was the consequence of a simple cup of coca tea, a common drink in South America.Having initially bowed to pressure from the World Anti-Doping Agency to partially uphold the striker's ban, CAS issued a statement Thursday saying it \"will not object\" to the request for a stay of execution.\"Guerrero's case received unlikely backing when the captains of France, Australia and Denmark -- Peru's group stage opponents at the World Cup -- wrote a letter to football's global governing body FIFA urging it to let him play.The sport's world players' union FIFPro lobbied much of that support and duly issued a statement Thursday expressing \"delight\" Guerrero had won temporary reprieve. \"Along with many professional footballers around the world, we strongly believe that Guerrero's 14-month sanction for unknowingly ingesting a banned substance is unfair and disproportionate,\" said a FIFPro spokesperson. \"While Guerrero has won a temporary reprieve from the Swiss federal court, it is unfortunate that he has to endure such a protracted legal wrangle that is still not over.\"Is the decision to suspend Guerrero's ban until after the World Cup justice served?

Fines will range from 1,000 Danish crowns ($160) for a first offense to 10,000 crowns for a fourth violation, the news agency said.The ban is the latest in a series to be approved by European lawmakers. A ban on wearing the full-face veil in public went into force in France in 2011.

Follow @cnnsport\n\nThe American's 23 majors speak to her immense powers on the tennis court and she engineered an out-of-this world comeback at the French Open against Ashleigh Barty on Thursday to reach the third round.

I want to do the best that I can. I want to be able to just do my best and one day tell my daughter that I tried my best. When I was out there, that's all I was trying to do.\"Lack of matchesDespite those nearly two-dozen grand slam titles, if Barty had prevailed it could hardly have been classified a massive upset. The 36-year-old Williams revealed for CNN that she almost died while giving birth to daughter Olympia in September and has only contested two tournaments in 2018 prior to Roland Garros. None came on clay, either, a specialized surface where moving can be difficult, unlike hard courts.  And Williams -- down to 451st in the rankings due to her tour inactivity -- was facing a different Barty than the one she defeated at the 2014 Australian Open for the loss of only three games. After taking a break from tennis as it all got too much for the junior Wimbledon winner, Barty enjoyed a breakthrough 2017. Her first serve fired as the opening frame unfolded while Williams was struggling. Barty's low slice caused havoc, Williams erred on overheads and dumped make-able volleys into the net. Her first-set tally read three winners and 12 unforced errors. We've missed this smile \ud83d\ude04It's great to have you back @serenawilliams! #RG18 pic.twitter.com/o8CP2gMEuH\u2014 Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) May 31, 2018\n\nThe first game of the second set brought yet more miscues and Williams was broken to love. Then came the turnaround. Big pointOn break point in the ensuing game, with a short forehand and Williams out of position, Barty directed her shot at her opponent instead of putting it away down the line. Williams duly sent her own forehand into the open court for 1-1. Of the 159 points in the match, that could have been the most important. There was simply no stopping Williams afterward, roars of delight and fist pumps confirming the shift. Barty, meanwhile, was rattled and the 22-year-old never regained her form of the first set. JUST WATCHEDA rare audience with Richard WilliamsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHA rare audience with Richard Williams 05:11In the final two sets Williams, whose next foe is 11th seed Julia Goerges, compiled 25 winners and 24 unforced errors.  \"I think she's not quite at the level she was when she was at her best, but that's normal,\" Barty said. \"But her level when she's not quite on her best is still bloody good.\"Williams acknowledged she is still seeking top form but is adamant she will find it. \"I'm probably not where I was before I left,\" said Williams. \"But the good news is I feel like I'm definitely going to get there. And I don't want to get there, I want to get beyond there. I don't want to limit myself. That's what I want to look forward to doing.\"Stunning comebacksWilliams has been closer to defeat at grand slams in the past. At the Australian Open, for example, in 2007 -- the last time she was unseeded at a major -- Nadia Petrova and Shahar Peer were within a whisker of ousting Williams. Williams didn't buckle and beat Maria Sharapova in the final. And at the French Open in 2015, when Williams dealt with illness, she overturned set deficits four times. In the final, Lucie Safarova led by a break in the third set prior to Williams' charge. Serena Williams came back to beat Ash Barty at the French Open on Thursday. Yet this comeback, with her time away from the game, playing on clay -- just three of her 23 grand slam titles have come at the French Open -- and how the first set unfolded, has to be right up there. Elsewhere, Sharapova -- a possible opponent of Williams' in the fourth round -- relinquished leads in both sets but still beat Donna Vekic 7-5 6-4 and top-ranked Simona Halep thumped Taylor Townsend 6-3 6-1.In the men's draw, 10-time champion Rafael Nadal cruised past Guido Pella 6-2 6-1 6-1, with Dominic Thiem -- perhaps the Spaniard's main threat -- completing a four-set win over Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-2 2-6 6-4 6-4. Rafael Nadal crushed Argentina's Guido Pella at the French Open. Nadal next encounters friend and French hope Richard Gasquet, against whom he holds a 15-0 record.

A full update on this story can be read here. Moscow (CNN)Moscow and Kiev are blaming each other for the death of Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko, who was shot dead in his apartment building in the Ukrainian capital on Tuesday.Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman implied Russia had orchestrated the killing. Babchenko was a vocal critic of the Kremlin and left Russia in 2017, saying he no longer felt safe there.\"I'm sure that the Russian totalitarian machine did not forgive him his honesty and his fidelity to principle,\" Groysman said in a Facebook post. \"Best friend of Ukraine, who told the truth about Russian aggression to the world. The murderers must be punished!\"Arkady Babchenko covering unrest in Kiev, Ukraine, on January 22, 2014.Ukrainian state news agency Ukrinform said Babchenko, 41, was shot in the back and died in an ambulance, citing his friend and supervisor, Ayder Muzhdabaev, deputy general manager of Ukrainian TV channel ATR.Read MoreKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov slammed Ukraine on Wednesday as an unsafe place for journalists to work.\"We know that many people are dying, many journalists are dying, journalists are thrown into prison for doing journalist work. We consider this unacceptable, we believe that this should be the topic for a very tough international reaction that will encourage the Ukrainian authorities to take effective measures to rectify the situation,\" he said. When asked for his response to Ukraine's accusations that Russia was behind the killing, Peskov dismissed the idea as anti-Russian.\"This is the highest level of cynicism amid such a brutal murder, to shake the air in such a Russophobic way, instead of talking about conducting a thorough and impartial investigation.\"Police guard the building where Arkady Babchenko was shot dead on Tuesday.But ATR's Muzhdabaev pointed out that Babchenko did not report on Ukrainian affairs and said his journalism was solely focused on Russian affairs. \"He did not do anything else. He did not conduct any investigations, did not write anything about Ukrainian affairs, exclusively journalism about the Russian government, about their actions, about their criminal activities, that's all,\" he said.  Russian-Ukrainian relations were plunged into crisis in 2014, when Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula and as pro-Russian rebels seized parts of the east of Ukraine.British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he was \"appalled\" by the killing of Babchenko.\"We must defend freedom of speech and it is vital that those responsible are now held to account,\" he wrote on Twitter.The UK has blamed Russia for the poisoning of a Russian ex-spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia Skripal, on British soil, but Moscow denies the accusation. The incident sparked a diplomatic crisis between the two countries.Manhunt underwayUkrainian police are now searching for the man they believe to be responsible for Babchenko's death. The Interior Ministry released a sketch of a bearded man wearing a baseball cap, and described him as being in his early 40s, between 175 and 180 centimeters tall, of average build and with gray in his beard.   Ukrainian officials released a sketch of the suspected killer.Babchenko left Russia after he criticized the Kremlin in a Facebook post in 2017. He faced backlash after commenting on the crash of a Russian plane transporting the world-famous military choir Alexandrov Ensemble en route to Syria. They were traveling to perform for pilots involved in Russia's air campaign on Aleppo. Babchenko called Russia an aggressor, and accused the country of killing children in its air support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime..CNN's Nathan Hodge, Mary Ilyushina and Antonia Mortensen reported from Moscow, Denis Lapin reported from Kiev, and Angela Dewan and Vasco Cotovio reported from London.",

The bulging biceps, long hair and headband remain, but the Spaniard's sense of style has certainly changed.Hide Caption 1 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2005 \u2013 Nadal went into his first French Open as an inexperienced 18-year-old and emerged a grand slam champion -- beating Roger Federer in the semifinals on his 19th birthday. The 2005 season was the birth of what would go on to be Nadal's classic look: sleeveless top and three-quarter length shorts.Hide Caption 2 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2006 \u2013 By the following year, Nadal had cemented his place among tennis' elite and was developing a fearsome reputation on clay. This time wearing a slightly less garish light blue, Nadal picked up his second consecutive French Open title by becoming the first man to beat Roger Federer in a grand slam final.Hide Caption 3 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2007 \u2013 In 2007, the then 20-year-old Nadal's status as the 'King of Clay' was sealed. Defeat to Federer at the Masters Series in Hamburg ended an 81-match unbeaten streak on clay, which remains a men's Open Era record today. At that year's French Open, Nadal opted for the reverse of 2006's top-bandana combo -- this time with matching trainers to boot.Hide Caption 4 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2008 \u2013 A year later, Nadal opted for a variation on his debut French Option look, this time sporting an all-green combo. Nadal reached world No. 1 for the first time in his career in 2008, helped by his fourth consecutive Roland Garros title -- matching Bjorn Borg's record of consecutive trophies, while also becoming only the seventh man to win a grand slam without dropping a set.Hide Caption 5 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2009 \u2013 Nadal's first dramatic transformation came in 2009. Gone were the sleeveless shirts and three-quarter lengths, in came the sleeves and fluorescent, clashing colors. Perhaps it was the sleeves restricting the powerful arms (or maybe a knee injury), but Nadal suffered the first of only two French Open defeats. Despite a shock fourth-round loss to Robin Soderling, Nadal set a record of 31 consecutive wins at Roland Garros.Hide Caption 6 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2010 \u2013 In 2010, Nadal bounced back from the 2009 disappointment with a daring multicolored number. He went on to exact revenge on Soderling, beating him in the final after the Swede had upset Federer in the quarterfinals. Federer's failure to reach the semis meant Nadal regained the world No. 1 spot, while it was also the second time he won the French Open without dropping a set.Hide Caption 7 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2011 \u2013 The following year, Nadal dialed down the brightness, instead choosing to return to one of his earliest Roland Garros styles. And it worked -- he maintained his No. 1 ranking throughout the clay court season and beat perennial rival Federer in the final.Hide Caption 8 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2012 \u2013 Perhaps in an attempt to gain the upper hand on opponents by blending into the clay, Nadal opted for an orange-ish-red look for the first time at the French Open. It appeared to work, as Nadal dropped just 30 games in the first five rounds, before beating Djokovic in four sets in the final to claim his seventh Roland Garros title and surpass Borg as the tournament's most successful player.Hide Caption 9 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2013 \u2013 The 2013 French Open was the debut of Nadal's latest wardrobe change: the short shorts. In an all-Spanish final, Nadal defeated David Ferrer in straight sets -- although bizarrely dropped from fourth in the world to fifth after his victory.Hide Caption 10 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2014 \u2013 Perhaps a sign of entering into his late 20s, Nadal's colors switched from fluorescent to more mellow tones. Despite being hampered by injuries and suffering surprise defeats early in the clay court season, Nadal grinded out arguably his most impressive Roland Garros victory. Another victory in the final against Djokovic took him to 14 grand slams (level with Pete Sampras) and it was his fifth straight French Open triumph.Hide Caption 11 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2015 \u2013 Nadal's struggle to find form continued into 2015's clay court season, dropping outside of the world's top five for the first time since 2005. Looking like an athletic version of the Cookie Monster, Nadal crashed out of the French Open in the quarterfinals to Djokovic. It ended his 39-match unbeaten run and marked just his second defeat on the Parisian clay.Hide Caption 12 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2016 \u2013 The following year, the shorts got even shorter and the two-tone top returned as Nadal exited the French Open in the third round -- although this time it was a wrist injury that defeated him. Despite the disappointment, there was another milestone for Nadal as he became only the eighth man to reach 200 grand slam wins.Hide Caption 13 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2017 \u2013 Nadal debuted his strong blue look against Benoit Paire in the first round and the King of Clay went on to complete \"'La Decima\" of 10 Roland Garros titles.Hide Caption 14 of 14'Feeling of freedom'Having turned pro when he was in his mid-teens, Nadal has been competing on the men's Tour for 16 years. During that time, he has reached great heights, becoming world No. 1 and winning 16 grand slam titles, including an unprecedented 10 Roland Garros championships.

        "content": "(CNN)A Russian journalist and critic of the Kremlin, reported to have been shot dead in Ukraine, showed up alive at a news conference on Wednesday to declare that his murder was faked by Ukrainian security services in an effort to foil an assassination plot against him.In a stunning development, Arkady Babchenko, 41, walked into a room of journalists in Kiev who had been expecting to get an update on his slaying.He apologized to his wife, Olechka -- who on Tuesday was reported to have found him bleeding to death at his apartment -- for the \"hell\" she had gone through. Ukrainian officials offered a jaw-dropping explanation for his so-called death: to expose a Russian plot against him.Two people, suspected of being the person who ordered the hit and the potential assassin, are in the custody of the security services, spokeswoman for the Ukraine Prosecutor General, Larisa Sargan, said later Wednesday.The elaborate ruse raised many questions. Chief among them, why was it necessary to go to such extraordinary lengths to expose the plot, who was in on it, and what did Olechka Babchenko really see when she found the bleeding body of her husband?Read MoreAt the news conference on Wednesday, none of these was addressed. Instead, flanked by Ukranian security officials, wearing a hoodie and occasionally flashing a sheepish smile, Babchenko launched into an explanation of the ploy.Babchenko (center) appears at a news conference Wednesday afternoon.He said Ukranian officials first told him about the threat against him, and their elaborate plan to thwart it, a month ago. Babchenko said he became convinced that Russian government agencies were involved in the alleged plot when he was shown his passport photo and personal documents, which he said could have been accessed by Russian special services.\"An offer was made to take part in this special operation,\" Babchenko said. \"I had no choice but to cooperate.\"The Security Service of Ukraine, or SBU, later revealed more details about the alleged plot. According to a statement released by the SBU, Russian special services recruited a Ukrainian citizen -- identified only as \"G\" -- who was tasked with finding, for a payment, perpetrators for a number of high-impact terrorist acts, including the assassination of Babchenko.\"He proposed to his friend, a former member of the ATO in the east of Ukraine, to execute, for $30,000, the contract kill on a Russian journalist, Arkady Babchenko. He has already transferred a deposit of $15,000,\" said Vasyl Hrytsak.According to the SBU, \"G\" also received a dossier on Babchenko with detailed information about his journalistic work and private life, including data on the target himself, his wife, children and parents. Information included phone numbers, bank account details and passport data, the SBU said.\"G\" faces a number of accusations, including aiding in the commitment of a terrorist act and endangering the life or health of a person to violate public safety. A pretrial investigation is underway.At times during the news conference, Babchenko seemed emotional.'Anti-Russian provocation'Only a day earlier, Ukranian authorities claimed they had launched an investigation into Babchenko's death and even released a sketch of the suspected killer.Police claimed he was shot in the back and died in an ambulance, citing his friend and supervisor, Ayder Muzhdabaev, deputy general manager of Ukrainian TV channel ATR. Ukraine blamed Russia for his \"death.\"Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko congratulated security services on a \"brilliant operation\" in \"saving the life\" of Babchenko. On his official Twitter account, Poroshenko said Ukrainian law enforcement agencies are becoming \"stronger in counteraction to Russian aggression.\" He later met Babchenko, embracing the journalist, and posted footage of the encounter on Twitter. The affair seemed unlikely to improve the frosty relations between Russia and Ukraine.In a statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry described the operation as \"obviously calculated propaganda\" and \"anti-Russian provocation.\"\"We state that the questions of life and death in Ukraine, as well as the international community's confidence in Ukraine's policy, are nothing more than bargaining chips for the anti-Russian hysteria of the Kiev regime,\" the statement said.Vladimir Dzhabarov, Deputy Chairman of the International Affairs Committee of Russian Federation Council, told state media outlet RIA Novosti that Kiev is now \"disgraced in the eyes of the whole world.\" Arkady Babchenko covering unrest in Kiev in 2014.'I apologize for what you had to go through'During the news conference Wednesday, Babchenko thanked the Ukrainian security services for saving his life. He also apologized to his wife and all those who believed he had been killed -- but said the secrecy had been unavoidable.\"I would like to apologize for what you all had to go through ... because I've buried friends and colleagues many times, and I know it's a sickening-vomiting feeling when you have to bury your colleagues,\" he said. \"Also I would like to apologize to my wife for the hell she went through in those two days. Olechka, I'm sorry, but there were no options here, either.\" He described how he first claimed to have broken his leg and then was requested to \"disappear somewhere\" in the weeks leading up to the staged murder, in a bid to thwart the assassins.Speaking to CNN, a journalist and colleague of Babchenko, Simon Ostrovsky, described Wednesday's revelation as \"totally shocking and unprecedented.\" \"For those of us who know Arkady personally, this is something that we're going to have to process for a little while longer,\" he said.Kateryna Lisunova, an acquaintance of Babchenko who works in New York as a special correspondent for Ukrainian television station Pryamiy, was in the ATR newsroom in Kiev to watch the news conference and posted a video on Facebook of people clapping, cheering and jumping as Babchenko appeared.The Committee to Protect Journalists, which had earlier decried Babchenko's \"murder,\" expressed relief that he was alive but demanded answers from the Ukranian authorities. \"We are relieved that Arkady Babchenko is alive,\" said Nina Ognianova, CPJ's Europe and Central Asia program coordinator. \"Ukrainian authorities must now disclose what necessitated the extreme measure of staging news of the Russian journalist's murder.\"Flowers lie under a picture of Babchenko placed on the memorial wall of Moscow's journalists house before he was revealed to be alive.Babchenko 'no longer felt safe' in RussiaNews of the apparent murder had stunned Kiev on Tuesday. Shortly after Babchenko's death was announced, Moscow and Kiev began blaming each other for the killing of the journalist, who is a vocal critic of the Kremlin and left Russia in 2017, saying he no longer felt safe. Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman implied Russia had orchestrated the \"killing\" of Babchenko, while Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed that idea and slammed Ukraine as an unsafe place for journalists to work.On Wednesday Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the affair was a propaganda exercise by Ukraine, but that she was happy Babchenko was alive.Babchenko left Russia after he criticized the Kremlin in a Facebook post in 2017.He faced backlash after commenting on the crash of a Russian plane transporting the world-famous military choir Alexandrov Ensemble en route to Syria. They were traveling to perform for pilots involved in Russia's air campaign on Aleppo.Babchenko called Russia an aggressor, and accused the country of killing children in its air support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime.CNN's Antonia Mortensen, Denis Lapin, Sebastian Shukla, Nathan Hodge and Mary Ilyushina contributed to this report",

For the time being, the towering German is mightily relieved after seeing off Dusan Lajovic 2-6 7-5 4-6 6-1 6-2 in three hours, 24 minutes. While Zverev has already made a name for himself on the tennis tour by climbing to third in the rankings and amassing three Masters titles by the age of 21 -- multiple Masters victories in the last decade have usually been reserved for the 'Big Four' -- he has yet to reach a grand slam quarterfinal. Or even defeat a top-50 foe at a major.  The paradox hasn't been lost on him. READ: 'Superhero' Serena sails through in slam returnBut in downing the world No. 60 in mostly sunny skies in Paris, the second seed moved into the third round and thus a step closer to the benchmark last eight. Lajovic appeared to be struggling with cramp in the fifth set, helping to explain the 31-minute final frame. \"Everybody tries to make a bigger story out of it than it is,\" Zverev told reporters. \"I'm not worried. I know if I'm doing the right things and if I do the right work I'll win those long matches, and the success will come itself. This is not something I think of on a daily basis.\"READ: Why Rafael Nadal is all at seaREAD: Who can stop Rafael Nadal in Paris?Alexander Zverev was stretched before winning his second-round match at Roland Garros. Zverev wasn't the lone big name to be stretched in the men's bottom half, with Grigor Dimitrov -- who won the year-end championships in 2017 -- and 2014 US Open finalist Kei Nishikori also overturning 2-1 set deficits. Dimitrov got past American Jared Donaldson 6-7 (4-7) 6-4 4-6 6-4 10-8 in four hours, 19 minutes and Nishikori improved to a phenomenal 120-38 in deciding third or fifth sets when the Japanese beat the always unpredictable Benoit Paire of France 6-3 2-6 4-6 6-2 6-3 in three hours.

The crowd didn't approve but the 21-year-old won the point as the Bulgarian sent his return long. He did it again at 8-8 but lost the point. Dimitrov wasn't fussed. \"I think it's great and it's in the game,\" said Dimitrov, who suspected he did it once in his career. \"Simple as that. I know why he did it. He was hurting big time.\"Dominic Thiem -- arguably the leading contender to make the final from the bottom half -- led Greece's Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-2 2-6 6-4 in an entertaining battle on the new court 18 when darkness halted play.

A rain delay ultimately swung the momentum in the Spaniard's favor. Nadal said afterward he was sure Zverev -- mentored by six-time grand slam winner Boris Becker -- would indeed experience success at grand slams soon but Lajovic initially did not read the script.  Striking his one-handed backhand with venom and throwing in his share of drop shots, the Serb stormed to the first set. In similar style, he upset Juan Martin del Potro in Madrid for a first top-10 win. Lajovic may feel the second set was the turning point: He broke early but failed to hang on to the lead.  Lajovic did recover in the third and as Zverev's frustration grew, he slammed his racket onto the red clay. Zverev's past foibles in grand slams however didn't phase him -- he was still competing well. And once he secured a double break advantage for 5-1 in the fourth, the job was almost done.  Zverev began hitting with more authority, though was aided by Lajovic's physical duress. \"In the fourth and fifth set I really felt good out there even though I was a little bit tired and a little bit fatigued,\" said Zverev, whose next opponent, 26th seed Damir Dzumhur, also went to five sets Wednesday. Marco Trungelliti's adventure, meanwhile, ended as the Argentine succumbed to Italy's Marco Cecchinato 6-1 7-6 (7-1) 6-1. Slow starts for HalepWhen Riske -- a finalist on clay Saturday in Nurnberg to return to the top 100 -- took the opener it marked more struggles for Halep early in majors. She trailed Destanee Aiava 5-2 in the first set of her first match in Melbourne and saved three match points in the third round against Lauren Davis. Halep went on to make the final, narrowly losing to Caroline Wozniacki. \"I think the nerves are really good.

A full update on this story can be read here.  (CNN)Prominent Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko, a critic of Russian actions in Ukraine and Syria, has been shot and killed in Kiev, Ukraine officials said late Tuesday.Ukrainian state news agency Ukrinform said Babchenko, 41, was shot in the back, at his home, and died in an ambulance. It cited his friend and supervisor, Ayder Muzhdabaev, deputy general manager of Ukrainian TV channel ATR.Arkady Babchenko covering unrest in Kiev, Ukraine, on January 22, 2014.Police in Kiev, Ukraine's capital, said Babchenko's wife found him outside their apartment.The Russian Foreign Ministry blamed Ukraine for what it called an \"armed assault.\"In a statement, the Russian ministry said: \"The level of physical violence and murders of the media workers in this country (Ukraine) has been growing consistently and the investigations do not result in the punishment of the criminals.\"Read MoreIt said independent groups should lead an investigation.However, Muzhdabaev said that Babchenko did not report on Ukrainian affairs and that his journalism was exclusively \"about the Russian government, about their actions, about their criminal activities, that's all.\"Police guard the building where Arkady Babchenko was shot dead, in Kiev, on Tuesday.Babchenko left Russia in 2017, saying he no longer felt safe there after he criticized the Kremlin in a Facebook post. He faced backlash after commenting on the crash of a Russian plane transporting the world-famous military choir Alexandrov Ensemble en route to Syria. They were traveling to perform for pilots involved in Russia's air campaign on Aleppo. Babchenko said in his post that Russia was bombing Aleppo and children were dying. He called Russia an aggressor.Police and journalists gather outside the building where Arkady Babchenko was shot dead.He described the ensuing \"political harassment\" in an essay in 2017. It included being singled out by senior politicians calling for his deportation and having his home address published online with an invitation to \"visit.\"Babchenko, who wrote for the Guardian and BBC as a war correspondent, was a former Russian soldier who fought in Chechnya. He described his Chechen experiences in a book, \"One Soldier's War in Chechnya.\"He fought as an 18-year-old conscript in the first Chechen War in 1996-98 and then volunteered to return for six months in 2000 during the second Chechen War, according to his publisher.

        "content": "Monaco (CNN)An event like no other, the Monaco Grand Prix must be experienced to be truly appreciated.For the lucky few, the Principality's historic streets and glistening harbors become a long weekend playground for the rich and the famous.From silver-screen stars to royalty, you don't have to look too hard to spot a celebrity, whose experiences of the famous Formula One race are likely to be vastly different from the thousands of average fans who flock to the hillsides to catch a glimpse of this truly unique circuit.So when money is no object here are some of the extravagances and indulgences which can be enjoyed in Monaco.Where to be seenIf you want to get ahead in Monaco ... head to the Amber Lounge. F1 drivers swap the track for the runway ahead of the big race.Read MoreThe F1 weekend kicks off in style with a charity auction/fashion show at the decadent  Amber Lounge on Friday night before qualifying, costing $610 per person for entry.Here the great and the good of Monaco -- including Prince Albert II -- descend to rub shoulders with models and F1 drivers who take part in the catwalk all in the good name of charity.Kicked off by a performance from rising singer Justin Jesso, the glittering white runway in front of the stunning bay backdrop plays host to models and drivers who strut their stuff in the garbs of one of fashion's hottest designers Alessandra Vicedomini.Next up is the auction where the real money comes out to play, with bids for rare artwork, exotic holidays and exclusive event packages fetching bids of over $58,000 for the noble cause of Jackie Stewart's Race Against Dementia foundation. Guests can then head over to the adjoining outdoor club U*NITE, where you can be waited on by a personal waitress, enjoy the private pavilion on the terrace, sip unlimited Champagne and selected fine wines -- all for $49,000 for a table of eight guests on the two-day package.Where to partyNFL football player Tom Brady, supermodel Bella Hadid and singer Geri Horner attended the Monaco GP last weekend.When night comes, the Monaco glitterati simply don't just head down to the local bar. A-lister socialites will be on an invite-only guest list of one of the harbor's many yacht parties which keep the well-heeled clientele dancing into the night.Supermodel Bella Hadid and legendary NFL quarterback Tom Brady were the noteworthy names on board the TAG Heuer yacht, where guests sipped Champagne dressed head to toe in white as huge spotlights beamed into the clear night sky and music blared from the four-level gleaming vessel overlooking the F1 paddock.Racasse corner comes alive at nightOr if you don't mind a grittier vibe but still want to feel the truly unique experience that is the Monaco GP, you can party into the small hours on the track itself at Rascasse corner. Here a number of bars line the straight heading into the turn and pump out the tunes for the packed crowds who flock to dance and drink on the street in front of the grandstand. Where to stayWake up to this amazing view of Fairmont bend.Of course, even high rollers need somewhere to rest their heads after the back-to-back parties, so why not hole up in a luxury suite where you can also enjoy unimpeded views of the famous Fairmont bend -- one of the most challenging on the course and one where you're probably the most likely to see daredevil overtaking manoeuvres, and therefore inevitably, crashes.One of the sprawling Grand Prix suites with double view of the track will set you back a tidy $77,000 for a four-night stay for two.Or if you want to get away from the madness around the course but still be in and among the F1 crowd, the Columbus Hotel plays host to many of the teams and sponsors -- due mainly to its convenient proximity to the track without being among the craziness, and its former ties with F1 great David Coulthard who used to own the hotel.Here guests can put their feet up in a boutique suite over the weekend for a around $2,323 a night. Plus, there's convenient access to a helipad right next door, where Monacair can shuttle you to Nice airport for a speedy getaway on a seven-minute flight for just $4,647 one-way on their chopper. A one-way ticket to Nice in a helicopter doesn't come cheap ...... but you get what you pay for.Well, it certainly beats dealing with the Monaco traffic on race day ...Where to relaxTake in a direct view of Monaco's Fairmont corner while being pampered.Traipsing around the numerous high-end designer boutiques of Monaco flexing that platinum credit card can take its toll, even in your finest Prada heels.So it's no surprise that you can enjoy a mani/pedicure it the \"Pole Position\" suite at the Fairmont hotel, which gives you floor-to-ceiling views of one of the most exciting bends of the race all while sitting back and being pampered in first-class style -- a bargain at $118.Where to cool off ...The blissful view of Nikki beachIf you don't happen to have a yacht  -- who doesn't have a yacht in Monaco? -- but you still want to be within touching distance of a refreshing dip while watching the race, then there's always the option of Nikki Beach. The rooftop pool/club is located trackside between the sea and the famous Monte-Carlo casino. With front row views of the race from the VIP grand stand and DJs spinning beats until late in the night, it's the prefect place to soak up the sun and infectious atmosphere of a race weekend.. A seat in the stand by the pool, buffet and open bar will set you back $1,510 on race day.",

        "content": "Liege, Belgium (CNN)A man who killed two policewomen and a bystander in the eastern Belgian city of Liege on Tuesday is suspected of killing someone the day before, according to the country's federal prosecutor's office. The perpetrator -- named as 31-year-old Belgian national Benjamin H. -- was serving a jail term for theft, violence, drug abuse and insubordination to police, the spokesperson for the Belgian Federal Prosecutor's Office, Eric Van Der Sypt, said Wednesday. He had been let out of prison on a temporary release, Van Der Sypt said.According to the terms of his parole, he had been expected to return to jail on Monday night at 7:30 p.m. (2:30 p.m ET) but failed to sign in. Instead, Belgian authorities now also suspect him of committing a burglary and then killing his accomplice. On Tuesday morning, the man stabbed two policewomen from behind before stealing their service weapons and using them to kill the officers. The attacker then opened fire on a parked vehicle nearby, killing the driver inside. Read MoreThe gunman later took a woman hostage at a local school before being shot dead by police. A handout provided by the Liege Police Department on Wednesday shows slain Liege police officers Soraya Belkacemi, left, and Lucille Garcia, right, in their uniforms. Terrorism probe continuesThe federal prosecutor's office said Wednesday that the suspect shouted \"Allahu Akbar\" (\"God is greater\" in Arabic) several times during the attack -- which they are continuing to investigate as terrorism.  Prosecutors said the exact motive remains unclear but they are continuing to investigate.  Also unclear is whether he was acting alone.Police understand the gunman was in contact with extremist elements between 2016 and 2017 but found no information on any extremist links this year.The modus operandi of the crime lends credence to the hypothesis that it was a terrorist attack, considering that ISIS online videos often call on their followers to attack police and kill them with their service weapons, Van Der Sypt said.     A toxicology report has been requested on the attacker, he added. Belgian authorities also faced questions over why a potentially radicalized prisoner was granted temporary release on Wednesday, according to Reuters.The justice minister, who presides over the prison service, told CNN affiliate RTBF radio he felt \"responsible.\" \"I have to examine my own conscience,\" Koen Geens said.Police prepare to lay flowers on a memorial in Liege, Belgium, a day after a gunman killed three people, including two policewomen. Belgium has been on a higher level of alert following a series of terror attacks in the country and neighboring France in recent years. Belgian authorities have previously faced criticism for missing opportunities to stop radicalized nationals who were later identified in the Paris and Brussels terror attacks. Liege is Belgium's third-largest city, after Brussels and Antwerp, according to the national tourist office. For centuries, it has been an important cultural and industrial center for the country.In 2011, Liege was also the scene of a grenade and gun attack that left at least five dead and injured more than 100.

(CNN)The path from rugby into American Football has been well trodden in recent years.Earlier this month, former Worcester Warriors lock Christian Williamson-Scotland signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers through the NFL's International Player Pathway. Last year, Alex Gray -- formerly of the England sevens team -- joined the Atlanta Falcons through the same system.One gridiron gladiator, however, went the other way. It was Tevaughn Campbell a now-unattached defensive back and punt-returner who set out to represent Canada in the World Sevens Series.Read MoreSevens is a reduced version a rugby, with seven players on each time instead of the usual 15.Follow @cnnsport\n\n\"I've personally never had any experience of playing any rugby until this season, in December,\" Campbell reveals to CNN.His brother had played the other oval-ball game at high school, but Campbell had always been put off by the legacy of scars and bruises his brother was left with thanks to rugby.Instead he focused on track and field and, later, football.READ: South Africa names first black rugby captainSo how did he get involved with sevens?Campbell explains: \"A former player (Robin McDowell) came up to me at university, in Regina. He was preaching his case, trying to get me to try out for the team. \"I rejected him a couple of times because I didn't want to play rugby; I didn't like the sport. It was probably a little too rough for me -- I was obviously thinking more about 15s at that point. I didn't even know sevens existed.McDowell then invited Campbell to the Vancouver leg of the Sevens World Series, an offer that was accepted.There, he met the Canadian team's head coach Damian McGrath who suggest Campbell join the team in Hong Kong and Singapore. \"Being me,\" said Campbell, \"I didn't turn that down so I went there and had a great experience and I decided to come back this year and try it out myself.\"Campbell turning out for the Montreal Alouettes in the CFL.Learning the rulesLast year, Campbell found himself listed as 23rd man for two series legs in Asia, though he did not feature. Having seen the energy and atmosphere of a sevens event first hand, he then witnessed Canada win a World Series leg for the first time in its history, in Singapore. He was impressed.It is understandable that Canada would court the 24-year-old flier. Campbell is honest enough to see that his country wish to find a crossover star like Perry Baker, who is currently leading try-scoring charts for the USA.Campbell is quicksilver. \"I have a knack for breaking records,\" he calmly states. At school he broke a 60m sprint record. He won a university track final one off-season. Perhaps most impressive, though, the University of Regina alumni broke the 40-yard dash record at the Canadian Football League Combine, screaming in at 4.355s in 2015. Of course, you can have all of the physical tools needed to succeed at a sport. It does not guarantee you will shine. So once Cambell decided that he would play sevens before returning to the CFL, the learning curve began its steep upward climb.READ: Could you handle a workout on Fiji's sand dunes?\"My first tournament was a development one in Dubai, and for me even just going to Dubai was an eye-opener,\" says Campbell, who had only ventured out of North America for the first time the year before. \"Then stepping on the field for a new sport -- not knowing any of the rules really -- it was definitely different. \"The main hurdle was just learning the rules. In some games I'd literally stand on the field and ask the ref, 'What's going on?' Because I had no idea. \"I'd be asking players during the game, 'Okay, what's happening now?' I picked it up pretty fast and the coach offered me to come on the World Series stage.\"JUST WATCHEDFiji and rugby sevens: A perfect combinationReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFiji and rugby sevens: A perfect combination 23:14Which all sounds like an impressive turnaround, but there have been misunderstandings too, which Campbell is able to laugh about now.\"At one point the ref called for a penalty. I wasn't very familiar, but he blew the whistle and put his arm up,\" he explains. \"I had the ball for some reason, and I heard everyone say 'Kick it and go!' So I tapped it on my foot and ran for the end zone. There was a moment of pause, where I started running and then stopped, and everyone else started stopping on the field because they were confused about why I was stopping. It was a domino effect.\"Campbell scored. A happy moment, but one made all the sweeter, he says, because fans from all over were cheering for him while he had a maple leaf on his chest. Looking for a teamCampbell was called in for his first series leg in Hamilton. He scored his first series try, streaking in down the left wing in a substitute appearance. He would feature in five tournaments, with the home leg in Vancouver coming after New Zealand, before stops in Las Vegas, Hong Kong and Singapore. He scored eight tries in 25 appearances. In a flash, the flirtation with rugby is over as quickly as it started. Campbell had signed a fresh contract for the Montreal Alouettes in the CFL but has just been released. He is on the lookout for another team, telling CNN: \"Right now, I'm just a guy waiting for someone to pick me up, but the path is the same and the future is bright.\" READ: The Olympic champion raised in a one-room hutIt is never a settled life in the CFL. Described by many as \"cutthroat\", Campbell had his eyes open when he joined out of university. Drafted by the Calgary Stampeders, he has been traded to the Saskatchewan Roughriders and then later the Alouettes, where he was let go in the build-up to their preseason games.\"I wouldn't say it's politics, but not a lot of Canadians get a starting position in the CFL,\" explains Campbell. \"Especially at my position, corner. There's not really any starting Canadian corners in the CFL and that's always where I've set my game to: being a starting corner, not a back-up or solely a special teams player. \"That's maybe where teams didn't see me in the past. They didn't see a Canadian corner on their defense. So that's kinda where I got bumped around a bit.\" Asked if he will continue in gridiron, rather than rugby, he replies: \"As of right now, yes.\" JUST WATCHEDFiji's spectacular sand dune workoutReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFiji's spectacular sand dune workout 01:30Visit cnn.com/rugby for more news and videosHowever, he had previously told CNN: \"Would I consider a switch back after (football)?

We'll try to break it down.1. Why is the boy hanging over the balcony?The 4-year-old was being looked after by his father in Paris while his mother was elsewhere. The dad had left the boy alone and the youngster had wandered out on the balcony.Neighbors told CNN the boy had actually fallen from the balcony above -- on the sixth floor -- but somehow caught himself on the railing below.Read More2. Why isn't the man above the boy pulling him to safety?The man in the adjoining apartment, who gave his name as Florian, reached over a dividing wall and grabbed the boy.  But he told CNN affiliate BFM TV that he feared the child might fall if he tried to pull him over to his balcony.\"I wanted to act carefully above all and I certainly did not want to risk the child's life,\" he said. Florian said he was encouraging the child to edge closer to him. \"He had extraordinary courage.\"3. Who is the hero climbing the building?Mamoudou Gassama, a 22-year-old immigrant from Mali, was in the neighborhood to watch a football match when he saw a crowd gathering around the apartment building.While others watched, he sprang into action, scaling the outside of the building before grabbing the child's arm and pulling him to safety. It took less than 30 seconds for Gassama to scale the building, earning him a \"Spider-Man\" nickname in some headlines.\"I didn't think about it, I climbed up and God helped me,\" he told French President Emmanuel Macron, who invited Gassama to the Elysee Palace and offered him French citizenship.

Footballer Ryan Giggs played 22 long seasons for Manchester United thanks, in part, to yoga. So what's the secret to 62-year-old showjumper John Whitaker's longevity? \"I'm pig headed and stubborn!\" admits the Briton, who won was winning World Championship medals as far back as 1980. \"Apart from riding I don't do any fitness training but I'm busy all the time and I'm not lazy. My family know they can't tell me to slow down. I want to keep competing and I will until I can't do it anymore.\"Read MoreAt his age, Whitaker could be forgiven for slowing down a little. Perhaps being more selective about the horses he rides, or cutting down on the number of international events he competes in.After all, he's been one of the world's leading showjumpers for nearly 45 years. But with the peak of the summer jumping season getting under way, that's not his style.In fact, according to the sport's governing body, 2017 was his busiest year for some time.JUST WATCHEDCNN Equestrian: Global Champions Tour ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCNN Equestrian: Global Champions Tour  22:59READ: Harrie Smolders selects his Horse of a LifetimeHe competed internationally on 15 different horses in over 321 competitions. A normal week would see him travel to a show on a Wednesday or Thursday, compete through to Sunday, fly home to train on a Monday and Tuesday before heading off again. It's a brutal, year-round sport that sees horses and riders compete across the globe, from US events in the winter to stops in Hong Kong and Shanghai.DynastyThe Whitaker family are one of the sport's most famous dynasties. His younger brother Michael has competed alongside John on British Olympic teams. His children Robert, Louise and Joanne, as well as most of his nephews and nieces, also compete at an elite level in jumping. His wife Claire, too, is a familiar face at the side of the competition arena and travels with him to most shows as well as owning one of his top horses Argento. The rest of his string predominately belong to HRH Princess Haya's \"Team Harmony\" who have supported Whitaker since 2014. \"I still ride five horses every day,\" he says. \"Nothing has changed in that regard. I don't feel 62 at all. I might wake up in the morning feeling a bit achy but for some reason, when I'm on a horse I feel just as I did in my twenties. \"I'm far better riding than I am off a horse.\"His results back this up. Whitaker's ability to adapt depending on the type or temperament of a horse has helped him collect 24 medals at Olympic, World and European championships during his long, distinguished career. One of his most famous horses was Milton, the first showjumping horse to win more than \u00a31 million in prize money and one of the most loved and recognized horses in the history of the sport. Despite not currently having a horse of Milton's caliber, Whitaker is still looking ahead to a possible seventh Olympic appearance. He'll be 65 by the time the 2020 Tokyo Olympics come around.\"For the last few years I haven't had a real superstar,\" he admits. \"I've got some very competitive horses that can win the right classes but realistically they aren't championship horses. \"At the moment I have some very nice younger horses. Everyone wants to go to the championships and have a big aim.\"JUST WATCHEDHorse of a lifetime: Don VHP ZReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHorse of a lifetime: Don VHP Z 01:59READ: Smolders picks up first win of the year in Hamburg'You don't bounce at my age' Anyone who rides a horse knows the dangers of falling off. Those risks are amplified by the effects of aging. \"I don't necessarily have a fear of falling off at my age but it is certainly more painful!\" says Whitaker. \"There is now this moment, when I leave the saddle, knowing I'm going to fall off and I'm flying through the air thinking to myself, 'that this is definitely going to hurt!' \"You don't bounce at my age! When you're young, you fall off and you don't hurt yourself so it doesn't worry you.''So knowing the potential risks of a heavy fall, surely he would avoid riding more unpredictable, younger horses and stick to the safer, more seasoned campaigners? \"I ride the younger horses more than my experienced ones,\" insists Whitaker. \"Every day, if need be, when I'm at home as they are often too big, strong and naughty for my daughters who would usually ride them when I'm away.\" It was off one of these tricky youngsters that was the last horse to unseat Whitaker.\"I last came off in February whilst competing in Spain,\" he recalls. \"The horse reared up and came over backwards onto me. I remember someone came over and said, 'you shouldn't be riding five-year-olds at your age' but I said it's just got to be done. \"I can't fear falling even if it could end my career.

        "content": "(CNN)Belgian authorities are investigating the killing of two policewomen and a passerby in the eastern city of Liege on Tuesday as a terror attack, the country's prosecutor said. Belgian media, including CNN affiliate RTBF, are naming the gunman as Benjamin Herman. A spokesperson for the Brussels prosecutor told CNN the attacker, who was shot dead by police, was 31 years old and had the initials B.H. but declined to provide the full name. RTBF reported that Herman was let out of prison on temporary release on Monday. He had been serving time on drug offenses. It said he may have been radicalized while in jail. The incident occurred around 10:30 a.m., when the assailant stabbed two policewomen from behind before stealing their service weapons and using them on the officers, Liege Prosecutor Philippe Dulieu said at a news conference on Tuesday.After killing the two officers, the attacker continued walking through the street and opened fire on a parked vehicle, fatally wounding the driver inside, Dulieu said.Read MoreAccording to the prosecutor, the suspect then took refuge in a local high school, where he held a woman hostage. When police intervened, the man opened fire, injuring several other officers, before he was shot dead.     \"It is clear that the objective of the assassin was to target the police,\" the head of Liege Police, Christian Beaupere, said later Tuesday. Beaupere said he wanted to reassure parents that the gunman did not plan to attack a school. \"His objective was not to kill in a school but to harm the police, the institutions and the state of Belgium.\"He refused to comment further on the investigation, saying the case is now with the Belgian prosecutor's office.It is not yet clear precisely what the attacker's motive may have been, a spokesperson from the Liege prosecutor's office told CNN earlier. Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said he and the government send their thoughts to the victims and their families.The Belgian Royal Palace also tweeted its sympathies after the shooting. \"Our thoughts are with the victims of this horrible act. Courage to their loved ones,\" the tweet read. Michel and King Philippe of Belgium arrived in Liege later Tuesday. Belgian Interior Minister Jan Jambon said on Twitter that the country's crisis center had been monitoring the situation. The crisis center said the students in the school were safe and that none had been injured. A police officer speaks with parents of children at a nearby high school.Liege resident Didier Deflem filmed a video allegedly showing special intervention police units shooting at the Liege attacker in front of the Waha high school.Deflem said: \"Police made us enter the building to protect us. The PAB (Peloton anti-banditisme, a special intervention unit of the city of Liege) intervened. The man wanted to run out and he was shot down. That's all I saw. We're still in shock.\" Pierre Etienne Dit Pave, who teaches French language classes nearby,said he was first alerted to the attack by a \"commotion in the street\" and went out to investigate.\"At one point a policeman told me to go inside. I went back to the classroom and locked the door for a while,\" he said. \"We heard a lot of shots. We didn't see anything because we were locked in the room.

In an interview with CNN affiliate BFM TV Monday, French prosecutor Francois Molins said the four-year-old's father had gone out shopping, leaving the child at home alone. His return to the apartment was delayed when he decided to start playing the smartphone game on the way back.According to Molins, the toddler was being looked after by his father in Paris while his mother was living on Reunion Island, a French-administered territory in the Indian Ocean.Video of the rescue went viral over the weekend, after young Malian migrant Mamoudou Gassama climbed four floors on the outside of an apartment building to save the dangling child. He has now been offered French citizenship and a job with the Paris fire brigade.According to Molins, the father, who faces up to two years in prison for abandoning his parental responsibilities, is devastated by the consequences of his actions.

I ran and I looked for solutions to save him and thank God I scaled the front of the building to the balcony,\" he said.Gassama took less than 30 seconds to reach the boy, using the railings on each balcony to pull himself up to the next floor.He later told French President Emmanuel Macon, who invited Gassama to the Elysee Palace to thank him personally, that the decision to climb the building had been a spontaneous one. \"I didn't think about it, I climbed up and God helped me,\" he said.In the video, cheers broke out when the young migrant reached the dangling child and pulled him over the balcony before Parisian emergency services could arrive. French media quickly dubbed Gassama 'Spider-Man.'Flanked by his older brother, Gassama holds his temporary residence permit after receiving it Tuesday.'He had extraordinary courage'The video also shows how, shortly after Gassama begins his ascent, a man in the apartment next to where the boy is hanging steps onto his balcony. He reaches across and grabs hold of the child.Inside the American elite unit rescuing from the skiesResponding to accusations that he could have done more to help, the neighbor -- named as Florian -- told BFM TV Tuesday that he feared the boy might fall if he tried to bring him over to his balcony, which is separated from the adjacent one by a wall. \"I wanted to act carefully above all and I certainly did not want to risk the child's life,\" he said. Florian said he was encouraging the child to edge closer to him. \"I was talking to him at the same time, I was telling him, 'Come up slowly,'\" he said, adding: \"He had extraordinary courage.\"Florian also said that the boy had first fallen from one of the floors above, before \"by miracle\" grabbing onto the fourth-floor balcony.Neighbor Jerry Alfred told CNN Tuesday that the father and son lived on the sixth floor of the building.Praise from French leadersFrench President Emmanuel Macron invited Gassama to the Elysee Palace on Monday where he presented the young man with a certificate and a gold medal for performing an act of courage and determination.

The world No. 70 saved the lone break point of the first on Philippe-Chatrier court, a set point, at 5-6 with an ace. As a result, the Czech held the momentum going into the tiebreak and duly raced to a 3-0 advantage. A combination of factors changed the complexion. Williams refused to donate any errors while Pliskova blinked, perhaps realizing how close she was to taking a set off the tennis great.  Pliskova regrouped for 2-0 in the second set but didn't recover when broken from 40-15 in the ensuing game, although Williams needed to save a trio of break points to confirm her passage into the second round.

Her path was ultimately trickier, with the Russian needing to overturn a break deficit in the third set against 133rd-ranked qualifier Richel Hogenkamp for a 6-14-6 6-3 win. It initially looked like the 31-year-old was destined for victory in an hour. Former French Open champion Sharapova, in Williams' quarter of the draw, said: \"Great to be in this draw. Great to be back on a court that I have had great success at. \"I have always loved playing here.

Indeed, the final in the Olimpiyskiy Stadium will be remembered as much for Karius' dreadful mistakes as the spectacular bicycle kick from Gareth Bale which put the Spaniards 2-1 ahead. Karius was distraught at the final whistle and posted on social media Sunday that he was \"infinitely sorry\" to his teammates, Liverpool fans and staff. \"Haven't really slept until now. The scenes are still running through my head again and again,\" the goalkeeper wrote. \"I know I messed it up with the two mistakes and let you all down.\"As I said I'd just like to turn back the time but that's not possible. It's even worse as we all felt that we could have beaten Real Madrid and we were in the game for a long time.\" Karius of Liverpool watches the ball cross the line as he concedes for the third time. Karius was dejected after the final whistle.With the match goalless early into the second half, Karius picked up the ball on the edge of his penalty area and appeared to try to roll the ball to a teammate, seemingly unaware of the lurking Karim Benzema, who intercepted to score into an empty net. At 2-1, the goalkeeper fumbled Bale's long-range shot to leave the result in no doubt. As Real celebrated at the final whistle, an inconsolable Karius buried his face into the turf and then tearfully apologize to Liverpool's supporters. Teammates have since come out in support of their goalkeeper. \"When we win, we win together. When we lose, we lose together. Don't blame him,\" Liverpool defender Dejan Loren told reporters. \"It's easy to blame someone but we are in the same ship together and everyone gave him the best words that they can.

But as more and more spots opened up in the draw for lucky losers -- an eighth berth materialized courtesy of Nick Kyrgios' departure Sunday -- Trungelliti suddenly had a way in. In Barcelona, where he resides, Trungelliti set off on the 1,000-kilometer road trip in a car with his brother, mum and 88-year-old grandma, who were all visiting. They reached the French capital shortly before midnight Sunday. With intermittent coffee breaks, the journey lasted a draining 10 hours. Grandma in shower\"Actually, my grandma was in the shower and I told her, 'OK, we go to Paris,'\" Trungelliti said. \"There are many flights canceled, so I didn't trust (that) too much. And then there is no train now (to) France so the best option was always, just take the car.\"The world No. 190 didn't have much time to ready for his opener -- his match was scheduled for the earliest slot of 11 a.m. -- but still beat someone else who was in the qualifying draw, Bernard Tomic, 6-4 5-7 6-4 6-4.

Cecchinato won the Budapest title in April as a lucky loser. The eight lucky losers are the guaranteed most in the men's draw of a grand slam since 2000, said the ITF. There were only two at this year's Australian Open and five altogether in 2017. The high number may have something to do with a rule change at grand slams this year: Players who pull out prior to their first-round match still get half of the prize money, with the other half going to the lucky loser. Marco Trungelliti hits a forehand in his win over Bernard Tomic at the French Open. It was implemented to lessen retirements or lopsided matches when players take to court injured or unwell. Normally a player like Trungelliti would only be interviewed by journalists from his country -- if that -- but such was the interest in his fable that he was brought to the main interview room at Roland Garros. Rare to use social media, he said it was his wife that got the word out about his unlikely path to the 16th arrondissement. Big crowd\"I never had a press conference with so many people. Not even when I played against (Marin) Cilic two years ago,\" said Trungelliti, referring to his win against the 2014 US Open champion at Roland Garros. Tomic is regarded as one of the bad boys in tennis -- his fellow Australian, Kyrgios, is trying to shed that reputation -- telling reporters he was going to count his \"millions\" after he fell in January's Australian Open qualifying. While Tomic may trump Trungelliti's bank balance, he is seemingly trying to resurrect a career that saw him reach the Wimbledon quarterfinals and 17th in the world two years ago. Fighting his way through qualifying on his least favorite surface is not a bad start. Tomic, however, was in no mood to talk Monday, offering up 15 short sentences to 10 questions in his mandatory post-match news conference. Elsewhere, there were mixed fortunes for the comeback quartet of Victoria Azarenka, Stan Wawrinka, Novak Djokovic and Petra Kvitova. Clay king Rafael Nadal led Simone Bolelli by two sets when rain forced the conclusion of the tussle to be pushed back to Tuesday, right before Serena Williams makes her own grand slam comeback.

Clay has traditionally been the twice grand slam winner's least productive surface and she had a mere three warmup matches on the dirt. Former champ outWawrinka only resurfaced from three months out due to his troublesome knee last week and the 2015 winner and 2017 finalist succumbed to his fellow tour veteran, Guillermo Garcia-Lopez, for a second time at the French Open. His 6-2 3-6 4-6 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 reverse will see the Swiss exit the top 200. \"If I have to play some Challengers, I have no problem with that,\" said Wawrinka. \"I won three grand slams in my career and I know what it takes to do it. And my goal is to get to my top. Sooner or later I will be.\"Djokovic gained momentum by testing Nadal in the semifinals of the Rome Masters this month. It was a much needed boost of confidence after a pair of demoralizing defeats in Indian Wells and Miami in March and falling to the talented but then-ranked No. 140 Martin Klizan in Barcelona.      The Serb -- who won four straight majors from 2015-2016, completing the job in Paris -- defeated Brazil's Rogerio Dutra Silva 6-3 6-4 6-4. As far as first matches at grand slams go, it was about right for Djokovic. He hit plenty of tennis balls, acclimatizing to the heavy conditions, but still won in straight sets. Kvitova contested her first tournament of 2017 at the French Open following a knife attack in her home five months earlier that left her with nerve damage to her left, playing hand. Twelve months ago the Czech was simply happy to back. Now she is one of the contenders after claiming four titles in 2018, including two on the clay.

        "content": "(CNN)The occupant of the Quirinale, the presidential palace in Rome, is meant to be above the daily cut and thrust of politics. Sergio Mattarella has been the model of restraint in his three years as President -- until now.Mattarella, a 75-year-old Sicilian and veteran politician, is known as a man of few words. But those he spoke Sunday night have sparked a constitutional crisis and populist outrage. He rejected a key appointment in the Cabinet of Prime Minister-designate Giuseppe Conte: that of euroskeptic Paolo Savona as finance minister. And he was blunt about the reason. \"The uncertainty over our position in the euro alarmed Italian and foreign investors,\" Mattarella said. The rising price of Italian debt would burn through savings and hurt companies.\"Membership of the euro is a fundamental choice for the future of our country and our young people,\" the President added.Giuseppe Conte addresses journalists after a meeting with President Sergio Mattarella on May 23.The man who once described his job as that of a \"political referee\" was brandishing the red card, and Italy entered its 84th day without a government. Read MoreConte --  a lawyer with no political experience -- has now given up trying to form a government, which may be just as well because he was under growing pressure to explain an academic resume that appears to have been embellished. But the populist alliance of the Five Star Movement and the League that had chosen him and was on the cusp of power has reacted furiously. Populist parties angeredIts outrage is all the greater because Mattarella's politics are left-of-center. Luigi Di Maio, leader of Five Star and rarely short of a colorful phrase, said: \"In this country, you can be a condemned criminal, convicted of tax fraud, under investigation for corruption and still be a minister. But if you criticize Europe, you can't be economy minister.\" He even suggested Mattarella could be impeached, but League leader Matteo Salvini, who once derided Mattarella as a \"cattocommunista\" (communist Catholic), has for now played down that option. Five Star and the right-wing League won 33% and 17% of votes respectively in the March election, a dramatic breakthrough for insurgent parties.Mattarella's decision to block the appointment of Savona gave the financial markets a brief respite -- with the yield on the Italian 10-year bond easing and Milan's stock exchange rising in early trading. But in the longer term, investors will return to themes that have long haunted them: Italy's massive debt (2.1 trillion euros and rising), an inflexible labor market and dysfunctional political system. Plus the prospect of Five Star and the League increasing their vote and implementing an unorthodox combination of tax cuts and higher welfare spending.The doyens of the European Union are also breathing a sigh of relief after Mattarella's intervention. External Affairs Commissioner Federica Mogherini, herself a former member of the Italian Parliament, said she had full trust in Italian institutions, \"starting with the Italian President who is the guarantor of the Italian constitution.\"Their anxiety is understandable. Savona had talked about Italy leaving the eurozone (though he has moderated his views recently) and League leader Salvini had complained: \"Italy is not a colony, we are not slaves of the Germans, the French, the [bond] spread or finance.\"What next?Former International Monetary Fund officials Carlo Cottarelli is Mattarella's next choice to form a government.Mattarella has asked a former International Monetary Fund official, Carlo Cottarelli, to form a government of technocrats. Cottarelli accepted the nomination on Monday. But his cabinet would have to get the approval of Parliament, where the League and Five Star have a majority in both houses. Salvini has already raised the stakes, warning other conservative parties such as Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia against supporting Cottarelli. \"If Berlusconi votes Cattarelli, goodbye alliance,\" Salvini told Italian radio on Monday.For its part, Forza Italia won't vote for any technocratic government, a party spokesman said on Monday.But some in Europe's corridors of power even look to Berlusconi as a safe pair of hands in the midst of this crisis. Berlusconi, who is now 81 and still tainted by innumerable corruption allegations, could emerge as kingmaker in a government comprising moderate parties, but they would have to perform considerably better than they did in March. Eurocrats in Brussels (and no doubt German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron) will be hoping that the League and Five Star's fractious entente falls apart, but the parties' supporters may actually be galvanized by Mattarella's act of \"resistance\" when Italians go the polls again, which could be in September if no government is formed. The President will not be perturbed by the fireworks he has set off. There are few harder training grounds than the politics of Sicily, where Mattarella cut his political teeth. In fact, his older brother Piersanti was shot by the Mafia in 1980, and died in his brother's arms.",

Since the Open era began in 1968, only Nadal, Federer, Djokovic and Andre Agassi have clinched a career grand slam.Even the great Pete Sampras, a seven-time Wimbledon champion and third on the list of Open-era grand slam winners, couldn't achieve it. Nor, for that matter, could Bjorn Borg, John McEnroe, Jimmy Connors, Ivan Lendl and Boris Becker.  Nadal may only have a singular Australian Open triumph to date, but then Federer and Djokovic have only won one French Open each.The 36-year-old Federer, who won his latest grand slam in Australia in January, skipped Paris this time to focus on the grasscourt season. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the epic Federer-Nadal five-set Wimbledon final thriller -- often thought of as the greatest tennis match ever. Sport does have a compelling habit of throwing up neat narratives -- a repeat in July could once again alter the grand slam landscape.  READ: Why Nadal is all at sea during his time offREAD: Meet the superfans who worship at the altar of Federer     When compared by tournament, Nadal's superiority on the red clay is clear.  While Federer and Djokovic have both won six Australian Opens, and Federer recently overhauled Sampras' seven at Wimbledon, and three players share five US Open wins, the Spaniard is head and shoulders above the rest in Paris.  Nadal made his name by winning at Roland Garros on his debut as a 19-year-old in 2005. Since then he has only lost twice -- to Swede Robin Soderling in 2009 and to Djokovic in 2015. That's 86 wins out of 88 matches.READ: Meet the veteran tennis photographer snapping the stars     If you take Borg's six French Open titles out of the equation, the next best Paris performers are miles behind which further reinforces Nadal's achievements. Even in the women's game no one can get close to him, with American Chris Evert leading the way on seven French Open titles.        It's hard to believe that as of this year Nadal has only played 79 matches on grass and from those he has garnered two Wimbledon titles. That in itself should show he is a bona fide all-court player. So what makes Nadal so good on clay? Former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash offered a few theories while working for CNN's Open court at Roland Garros.\"We have never seen a player hit so much top spin before,\" said the Australian.\"The power he puts into the shots and the top spin is just very, very hard to control on a slow court over five sets.\"     Then there is Nadal's athleticism \"He's unbelievably fast, and he can keep going forever, which helps on the clay,\" adds Cash.\"He keeps getting the ball back, his speed and athleticism is just phenomenal.\"His footwork on the clay is amazing, I don't think I've ever seen anybody move that quick on the clay.\"And there is the mindset.\"Mentally, he's just ferocious,\" said Cash.\"Clay is one of the toughest surfaces to be successful at, because you have to be focused all the time, the momentum can change very quickly.\"  The \"King of Clay\" could yet be the king of the tennis world.",

        "content": "(CNN)Three decades ago, Ireland was a very different place. Divorce was illegal, as was same-sex marriage. Abortion, already illegal in practice, was constitutionally banned in a 1983 referendum -- known as the Eighth Amendment.On Saturday Ireland emphatically voted to repeal that constitutional amendment in a referendum, paving the way for legalized abortion. \"If you look at 1983, when the anti-abortion clause was put into the constitution, to now, the change is just extraordinary,\" said Irish Times columnist Fintan O'Toole.He said the diminishing influence of the Catholic church, along with the urbanization of a rural society, improved access to higher education, and an increasingly vocal women's movement, had all contributed to a shift in perceptions.  'Irish abortions happen; they just don't happen on Irish soil'Saturday's referendum is the latest in a series of recent liberalizations in Ireland, which last year elected its first gay and biracial Prime Minister, or Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar. Read More\"Thirty years ago if you had said there was any possibility the prime minister would be gay or from a biracial background, people probably would have found that just impossible to imagine,\" O'Toole said.\"And now it's not just possible to imagine, it's almost uninteresting, it's just taken for granted.\"Here's a look at some of Ireland's legislation in recent years:2018: Referendum paves way for legalized abortionYes voters celebrate after Ireland votes to repeal the 8th Amendment, paving the way for legalized abortion. Saturday's referendum, in which 66.4% of voters said yes to repealing the Eighth Amendment to the constitution, opens the doors to legislation allowing abortion up to 12 weeks gestation -- and later in cases in which there is a risk to the mother's life or the fetus is not expected to survive.Only one county voted no in the referendum -- the rural and religiously conservative Donegal in northwest Ireland.Up until now abortion has been illegal in Ireland -- except when there's a \"real and substantial risk\" to the mother's life -- with women caught breaking the law facing up to 14 years in jail.2015: Same-sex marriage legalizedGay couple Michael Barron and Jamie Nanci kiss during the referendum vote on same-sex marriage in 2015. On May 22, 2015, Ireland became the first country to legalize same-sex marriage through a popular vote, with over 60% voting yes in a referendum.The measure was legalized on November 16 that year.1996: Divorce legalized Irish women push strollers under a government-sponsored poster in Dublin, 1995.In 1995 a referendum on legalizing divorce was passed -- just. The final tally showed 50.3% were in favor of ending Ireland's 58-year-old ban on divorce, with 49.7% opposed to the change.The measure was signed into law on June 17, 1996.1993: Homosexual acts decriminalizedAlmost two decades after homosexual acts were decriminalised in Ireland, supporters celebrate the same-sex marriage referendum in Dublin. Ireland has seen a huge change in LGBT rights. As recently as 1992, marchers in a gay pride parade in Cork reportedly wore masks so as not to embarrass family members. The following year, consensual homosexual acts between adults were decriminalized. Today, same-sex marriage is legal, and the country's leader is openly gay. 1979: Contraceptives legalized Contraception was legalized in 1979, but with tight restrictions. Doctors needed to write prescriptions after being \"satisfied that the person was seeking the contraceptives for bona fide family planning purposes,\" according to the Irish Family Planning Association.How Trump's anti-abortion agenda impacts women around the world\nHowever the reality was quite different, as O'Toole recounts. \"I was a student in the 1970s and we were distributing condoms through the student union at the university,\" he said.\"In one case,  police seized a condom-dispensing machine at the university. So all of that kind of stuff was going on. The law didn't really change behavior that much,\" O'Toole added.Much like the thousands of Irish women who each year travel to the UK for an abortion, it seems Irish people have long found ways to get around legislation.\"What you're seeing now is this culmination of a very long divergence between actual behavior, and the law,\" said O'Toole.",

        "content": "Dublin (CNN)As she held her 18-month old daughter closely to her chest, Amanda Mellet summed up in words what many in Ireland were feeling Saturday after the nation's referendum on abortion passed by a landslide. \"It just means that women -- and the men who love the women of Ireland -- have spoken out and they've said times have to change. And they are going to change now,\" a tearful Mellet said at the Royal Dublin Society, where the count took place throughout the day. A crisis pregnancy for Mellet in 2011 became an important step in the fight against Ireland's constitutional amendment that bans abortion in almost all circumstances. She was forced to choose between carrying a non-viable pregnancy to term, or travelling abroad for a termination. She chose the latter, and in June 2016, the UN's Human Rights Council ruled that the country's abortion regime subjected her to \"cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment,\" and called on the Irish government to reform its laws.Amanda Mellet, with her husband James and daughter Ella at the count in Dublin Saturday. Now, voters in Ireland have had their say.Under a blistering sun in Dublin Castle across town, thousands of people chanted \"Yes\" as they waited for the final results to be announced. They arrived to celebrate early because an exit poll released by Ireland's national broadcaster RTE signaled that a victory was in store for yes voters -- who had advocated to repeal the amendment -- defying earlier projections that the race would be tight.Yes voters filled Dublin Castle on Saturday. Read MoreScores of other abortion rights activists gathered across Dublin throughout the day. Dr. Ruth Cullen, a spokeswoman for the anti-abortion LoveBoth campaign, conceded defeat Saturday before the count had finished.Clare Comran was at the count, where she watched as all Dublin constituencies were declared overwhelmingly in favor of repealing the amendment, including one area that voted yes at 78.5%. Comran said she had always hoped Ireland would make the \"leap forward\" and had recently noticed a shift in national attitudes. The Irish people, she said, were \"really ready to embrace progress and trust themselves.\" \"It feels really lovely to be trusted and to feel like a whole person in my country. I've never had that in my entire life as an Irish person,\" she said, adding that she was grateful for the groundwork that women's rights activists had done to arrive at this moment. Ailbhe Smyth, co-director of the pro-repeal umbrella group Together for yes, greets supporters at the count in Dublin on Saturday. Ailbhe Smyth, a veteran campaigner and co-director of Together4Yes, the national pro-repeal group, is one of those women. As she arrived to the count, she was greeted with roars of applause from supporters, who thanked her for her longstanding efforts. Smyth told CNN that the road to get to this day had been a long and hard one, but the result marked a seismic shift for the country.  \"Irish people are clearly standing up and saying of course the lives of women in Ireland matter. It's a great victory for equality for freedom for dignity for human rights, -- and not only for women,\" Smyth said.  A baby's murder opened a dark chapter in Ireland that still hasn't been closedMark Hickey, a no voter, observed the count with two other anti-abortion campaigners and was not celebrating. \"Truth is not established by popular consensus,\" he said. \"We will look back at this moment in history at being a very grey one.\"Lawmakers are expected to vote on legislation providing for terminations in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy -- and later in cases where there is a risk to the mother's life or the fetus is not expected to survive by the end of the year. Not far from the polling station, a more somber atmosphere was felt at the mural of Savita Halappanavar, a 31-year-old woman who died in 2012 from a septic miscarriage in Galway after being denied an abortion. A woman leaves flowers at the Savita Halappanavar mural in Dublin on Saturday.John Howard, 28, brought a bouquet of flowers to the site.\"Her story was one that captured the realities of what the Eighth Amendment meant in a material, tangible way,\" he said. \"It took the life of a woman. Her memory is a bit of an avatar for change \u2014 and for the direction that we'd like Ireland to take. Her story encapsulates what we'd like to never see again and hope that whatever changes can be made in her honor.\"Others left notes. One read: \"If I have a daughter, I will name her Savita, after you.\"'Irish abortions happen; they just don't happen on Irish soil'By late afternoon, thousands of supporters had gathered in Dublin Castle, where a festive atmosphere was unfolding among a crowd of all ages. Author Brendan Lynch, 81, said it was a happy day. Brendan Lynch, 81, was standing between a group of young people drinking sparkling wine and a mother whose children had fallen asleep in their stroller.He said he was happy Ireland had moved on from its past, one where the Church \"controlled everything.\" He acknowledged that he was an outlier in his age group, nodding to RTE polls that demonstrated voters 65 and over were the group with a majority vote for no. \"I never thought I would see this day,\" he said. \"I'm absolutely delighted, and I feel sorry for all the women who had to go to England to have abortions. But now those days are over.\"Voices for Choice sang a mashup of familiar songs with referendum specific lyrics throughout the day in Dublin Castle. Moments later, a chorus exchanged classic rock lyrics for feminist rhymes as a group of women dressed in angel costumes walked by. As the final results trickled in, the skies briefly opened. An Irish mist sprinkled over the crowd, but the mood was not dampened. The Friday turnout was 64.13% -- a record high. The country's Referendum Commission said 1,429,98 (66.4%) voted for the amendment  and 723,632 (33.6%) voted against. Emma Gallagher, 22, was crying with joy moments after the referendum passed. \"I feel safe now, I feel comfortable,\" she said. \"It felt for a long time women didn't matter...now we know that we matter.\"Emotions were raw as the official results were announced at Dublin Castle Saturday evening.Next to her was Rene Wogan, a 66-year-old woman who said she didn't vote in the 1983 referendum -- which placed the abortion ban into the constitution -- for fear of speaking out against cultural norms of the time.Wogan said this time was different and held Gallagher's hand in solidarity. \"It was all for justice,\" she told Gallagher. \"You're forwarding the flag on for women.\"Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said in a press conference that a \"quiet revolution\" had taken place.In the square, a crowd of some 5,000 supporters roared, \"We did it.\"",

Ricciardo held off Sebastian Vettel for Ferrari and title leader Lewis Hamilton in his Mercedes despite suffering a loss of power just before halfway in the 78-lap race on the testing street circuit. It was his seventh career win and just reward after his 2016 disappointment in Monaco when a late pit stop error cost him certain victory and left him devastated.\"It was two years in the making this and I really feel that redemption has arrived,\" Ricciardo said after taking the checkered flag.\"After the loss of power I thought the race was done, but I got home using just six gears,\" he added.Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo leads the 2018 Monaco Grand Prix with Sebastian Vettel close behind in his Ferrari. Read MoreVettel, like the other frontrunners was struggling with tire wear, but has closed the gap in the standings to Hamilton to just 14 points after six rounds of the championship, with Ricciardo 24 points further adrift in third.Kimi Raikkonen finished fourth in the second Ferrari, with Hamilton's teammate Valtteri Bottas in fifth.Ricciardo's Red Bull teammate Max Verstappen carved his way through to ninth having started at the back of the grid after being unable to take part in Saturday's qualifying following an earlier crash in practice.While it was a case of what might have been for the young Dutchman, Ricciardo was left to celebrate a hard-fought victory which looked to be slipping from his grasp when he reported losing power and his pace immediately slowed. Lewis Hamilton as a teammate? Sebastian Vettel prefers Kimi Raikkonen\"Just keep focused\" came the reply back on team radio, aware that overtaking is notoriously difficult on the Monaco circuit.Ricciardo did just that, having dominated all the practice sessions before claiming the second pole position of his career Saturday.A clean start left him clear of Vettel, who was only able to seriously challenge after Ricciardo's technical issues, but was still unable to force home his advantage.Race winner Ricciardo drives past the famous Casino in Monte Carlo on his way to his superb victory.\"I think we had the pace, but it was a tricky race,\" admitted Vettel. \"I started to pick up a bit but then lost a bit in my tires.\"Hamilton, who had won the previous two rounds, also briefly scented victory as the field closed up, but also slipped back by the end.\"First of all, congratulations to Daniel and Red Bull, they did a great job.\"I did everything I could.

        "content": "Madrid (CNN)It's arguably the toughest club in the world to manage -- how else to explain Zinedine Zidane's decision to quit as Real Madrid coach just days after guiding the team to a third successive Champions League title?\"This team must keep winning and it needs a change after three years, another voice, another method of working,\" said Zidane as he announced he is to step down on Thursday.READ: Zinedine Zidane announces shock departure from Real MadridSaturday's 3-1 win over Liverpool in the Champions League final ensured Zidane and Real ended the season on a high, but the 2017/2018 La Liga campaign proved to be a slog for Los Blancos as rivals Barcelona romped to the title.Follow @cnnsport\n\nReal's passage to the final wasn't altogether a smooth one either, with both Juventus and Bayern Munich running the Spanish team close.Read MoreReal's entire Champions League season was encapsulated in the 90 minutes of Saturday's final -- as Zidane's side wrote themselves into European Cup history with a fully deserved victory over a Liverpool team who gave it everything, but were ultimately powerless against the forces of fate and history.Madrid were outplayed for long periods over the 90 minutes, and Liverpool eventually dealt impressively with losing their key player Mohamed Salah to injury. But Los Blancos came out on top in the end thanks to a mix of individual brilliance on their part and perfectly timed mistakes from their opponents.Zidane also won praise for his decision to bring on Gareth Bale in the second half. Bale scored twice, his first coming from a spectacular overhead kick.Until 12 months ago no club had ever managed to retain the Champions League in its modern format. But Madrid have now won three in a row -- something nobody had done since the 1970s, when the European Cup competition was much slimmer and less competitive.READ: Real Madrid beats Liverpool to win Champions LeagueThe 2016, 2017 and 2018 winners now take their place in the record books along with Franz Beckenbauer's Bayern Munich, Johan Cruyff's Ajax, and Alfredo Di Stefano's Madrid. These are the greatest teams in the competition's history, who all dominated their eras with a clearly identifiable philosophy on the game.Real Madrid's French coach Zinedine Zidane poses with the trophy after winning  the UEFA Champions League final  against Liverpool.But today's dominant force are more difficult to define.You could say this is Cristiano Ronaldo's Madrid -- as the Portuguese has now been top-scorer in the competition in each of the last five seasons, and again played a key role in getting the team to the final this year.Although after a poor individual showing on Saturday night, Ronaldo showed the petulant side of his personality by immediately threatening to leave the club this summer.Bale's bicycle kick was the game's key moment, and one of the outstanding goals in the tournament's entire history.But then Bale was only a substitute on Saturday, having been a peripheral figure for much of the 2017/18 season, and he also spoke right after the game about playing elsewhere next season.This Madrid side has its Galacticos for sure -- just like the 2000 and 2002 winners with Zidane as a player and Luis Figo, and the 1950s generation with Di Stefano and Ferenc Puskas. However despite all their big star names, the current side is more about the collective than the individual. Just how 'Great' is Zinedine Zidane's Real Madrid?Nine players have started each of the last three finals -- Keylor Navas, Marcelo, Sergio Ramos, Dani Carvajal, Casemiro, Toni Kroos, Luka Modric, Karim Benzema and Ronaldo. Bale and Raphael Varane also now have four winners medals [adding in 2014 too]. It is quite remarkable how the same side has stayed together, especially at a time in which the top players have become commodities which are easily traded for huge sums.Much of the credit for this must to go to Zidane -- who was an assistant to Carlo Ancelotti in 2014, and has now won the most difficult trophy in world soccer in each of his three seasons as head coach. Real head coach Zidane shares a moment with Isco after Real Madrid's 3-1 victory over Liverpool in the Champions League final.He himself admitted last week that he was not a tactical genius, but that is not what is required when you have so much talent in your squad.The Frenchman prefers to concentrate on honesty of effort, competitive spirit and enjoying the daily toil -- humble values not always associated with the Bernabeu. If we work as hard as our opponents, he often says, then our individual quality will do the rest.It helps that Zidane, having won everything as a player, has no need to feed his own ego himself. He has freely admitted that his team have gotten breaks in key moments through each of the last three years. In 2014 in Lisbon, Atletico Madrid were 1-0 up going into the 93rd minute. Two years later in Milan, against Atletico again, it went to penalty kicks. 12 months ago in Cardiff, a previously unbreakable Juventus defence shattered. And on Saturday night in Kiev, Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius provided two of the worst goalkeeping mistakes in European Cup history. Loris Karius of Liverpool breaks down in tears after his goalkeeping errors led to his team's 3-1 defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions Leauge final. But this Madrid team's genius, and Zidane's great achievement, has been in making sure that they are in the right place at the right time, ready and waiting to push home any advantage that comes their way.The 2017/18 season especially has showcased an outstanding ability to roll with the punches, but to stay on their feet, and then deliver knock-out blows themselves. That is the real sign of a champion, in any sport, and one of the main reasons why they keep coming back year after year.Ronaldo scores twice as Real Madrid win historic Champions League title Zidane's ability to keep everybody focused on the greater goal has been particularly impressive through recent months.While Ronaldo's unhappiness that other superstars elsewhere are better paid has been present since last summer, he was persuaded to park the issue until the important business of winning the trophy was out of the way.Similarly Bale has been clearly frustrated through recent months, but Zidane's decision to use the Welshman as an impact substitute in the final clearly paid off. Madrid club president Florentino Perez has also, whether through fortune or design, not added any new expensive Galactico stars since 2014, allowing a real team to mature and bond together. Whether this continues into the summer now remains to be seen, with speculation of a new world record move for Paris Saint-Germain star Neymar growing in recent weeks.Visit our football page for more stories and videos\"I told the players to enjoy it as they will never be anything like this again,\" Zidane said during Saturday's celebrations. What this Madrid side have done in recent years really is unique, and their understated coach deserves the biggest share of credit.Additional reporting by John Sinnott",

After losing in the qualifying tournament, Safwat had been put on the so-called 'lucky loser' list of players, who are given the chance to enter the main draw in case of a withdrawal.When Serbia's Viktor Troicki pulled out of his 11 a.m. match against Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov on Sunday morning with a lower back injury, Safwat got his chance.\"I always was dream to play on center court with such a crowd,\" Safwat told reporters, after losing 6-1, 6-4, 7-6 (1) to the fourth-seeded Dimitrov. Safwat, the first man from Egypt to play in a main draw match of a major since Tamer El Sawy at the 1996 U.S. Open, said he had never even been inside of the main Court Philippe Chatrier. \"It's something I always saw it on TV, but I never had the experience to see,\" said Safwat, who got a huge ovation from the crowd after the match. \"So it was really, really enjoyable for me.\"As for Dimitrov, he was given even less notice.\"I just found out about 30, 35 minutes before I had to go out,\" Dimitrov said in a news conference. \"After my warmup today, I just walked into the locker room, and Viktor was, like, 'Hey, good luck today.'\" Stephens ends post-US Open slumpSloane Stephens ended her grand slam drought since winning the US Open last summer with a 6-2, 6-0 win over lucky loser Arantxa Rus of the Netherlands on the new Court 18.Winning the biggest title of her life took some time getting used to, said Stephens, who posted eight straight defeats, including a first-round loss at the Australian Open, after her New York breakthrough.Stephens with the Miami trophyBut her game finally clicked back into gear during the US hard court swing, where she beat defending French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko for the Miami Open title in March.\"I had to take care of myself,\" Stephens told a news conference at Roland Garros. \"I tried to do way more than I should have after the U.S. Open, and I should have just shut it down. But like I've said before, my heart was there but my body wasn't. So when the two things aren't connected, it's never a good thing.\"Although Stephens has never got to the second week in Paris, she reached the last sixteen each year between 2012 and 2015, losing to the eventual champion on three occasions.Svitolina survivesElina Svitolina of the Ukraine, one of the title favorites after retaining her Rome crown the week before Roland Garros, came back from a set point down to beat the unseeded Australian Alja Tomljanovic, 7-5, 6-3. Other winners on the first day of Roland-Garros included Japan's Kei Nishikori, the second-seeded German  Alexander Zverev and France's Gael Monfils.

READ: Serena, Rafa bidding for history Read MoreCzech police disclosed this week they finally had a male suspect in custody, which Kvitova said was \"great.\" Tendons and nerves in her dominant left hand were damaged in the attack. There were psychological ramifications, too. Her life had been turned upside down. Kvitova's surgeon had said from the outset that her chances of playing seriously again were \"very low,\" but her mental strength pulled her through, earlier than many had expected, and at last year's French Open she progressed to the second round having barely practiced. By making it to the tournament in the first place, she had \"already won my biggest fight.\" Fellow pros rooted for her A year on and much has changed again for the world No. 8. Her fitness enhanced and belief boosted, the 28-year-old is in fine form. This despite saying her hand will never be 100 percent. Kvitova won a record third title in MadridThough regarded as more dangerous on faster surfaces, half of the left-hander's four titles this year have come on clay.She hopes that the form which has seen her enjoy an 11-match winning streak, bringing her titles on the red dirt in Madrid and Prague, will continue. The triumph on home turf was particularly \"special\" and left her in tears during her victory speech to the crowd. \"Overall I feel good on the clay so far and in the past few weeks I'm enjoying time on the practice court, and match court as well,\" she says.

Follow @cnnsport\n\nThey may be second best to Barcelona of late domestically, but Real Madrid beat Liverpool 3-1 to make yet more history in Europe indeed. Billed as a duel between Ronaldo and Liverpool's Mo Salah, Gareth Bale instead grabbed the spotlight coming off the bench. Salah, meanwhile, left the game in tears in the first half after injuring his shoulder and his World Cup campaign with Egypt is in doubt. \"Salah's injury is very serious,\" said Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp. \"It does not look good.\"Real Madrid's European resume does look good, though. It is now three titles in succession to match Bayern Munich's feat from 1974-76 and no team has won more than Los Blancos' 13 crowns overall. \ud83d\udcf8\ud83c\udfc6 #CHAMP13NS \ud83d\ude03 pic.twitter.com/75vJMQT0G1\u2014 Real Madrid C.F. \u26bd\ufe0f (@realmadrid) May 26, 2018\n\nRead MoreLittle wonder that Real Madrid's energetic left-back Marcelo proclaimed: \"This is a legendary side.\" Midfield wizard Luka Modric used the word \"dynasty.\" READ: Champions League price hikesSaturday's final at the Olympic Stadium in Kiev will be remembered, most notably, for Bale's sumptuous 64th-minute winner courtesy of an overhead kick -- he only came on in the 61st. \"To score a goal like that on the biggest stage in world football is a dream come true,\" said Bale. \"I've never actually scored a bicycle kick. I've had many attempts and it's been something I've always wanted to do.\"Let the debate begin: Which was the better goal, Bale's or Ronaldo's overhead kick against Juventus in the semifinals?The Welshman would go on to collect his second in the dying minutes to put the Reds away. Real Madrid's Gareth Bale scored the winning goal in the Champions League final with a superb overhead kick. Karim Benzema had opened the scoring for Real Madrid in the 51st minute in unusual circumstances, only for Sadio Mane to level in the 55th. Mane shone for Liverpool in Salah's absence, later hitting the post and forcing Sergio Ramos to make a last-ditch interception as he charged toward goal when it was 2-1.  Aside from Mane, two Liverpool players won't be forgotten, either. Unfortunately not for the reasons Liverpool fans would have wanted. Salah was left in severe pain after tangling with the robust Ramos, while keeper Loris Karius was at fault for two of the three Real Madrid goals. \"I don't know what happened,\" said Karius. \"I just feel very sorry for my teammates, for losing the final.\"Salah injury key Liverpool controlled proceedings prior to Salah's shoulder injury but were never the same afterward. In perhaps the game's most poignant moment, he was consoled by Ronaldo as he was substituted in the 30th minute. They both scored a staggering 44 club goals this term. Ronaldo was mostly kept quiet, shooting over the bar within 20 minutes and sending his header at Karius as halftime loomed.  READ: Day in the life of SalahThe Portuguese knows what it is like to depart a big final hurt, doing so in the Euro 2016 finale against France. Ronaldo (left) consoles Liverpool's Mo Salah as he went off injured.  Salah, according to initial reports, suffered from a dislocated shoulder.The goalkeeping position has been a source of concern for Liverpool supporters the entire season, with Klopp finally settling on Karius after benching Simon Mignolet. Karius is only 24, especially young for a keeper, and his inexperience cost Liverpool dearly. In no danger as he collected the ball in the 51st minute, he attempted to throw to defender Dejan Lovren with Benzema lurking. Benzema alertly stuck out his right leg to intercept the pass and steer the ball into a gaping net. JUST WATCHEDFrom humble beginnings to global fameReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFrom humble beginnings to global fame 07:31Karius wanted a foul but to no avail, and rightly so. There was no infraction. With Salah gone and conceding in such a bizarre fashion, you thought that might be it for Liverpool. Adam Lallana replaced Salah but his linkup play with Mane and Roberto Firmino couldn't replicate the Egyptian's work. Hope for Liverpool Mane, however, gave Liverpool hope when he latched on to Lovren's header from a corner to make it 1-1. Liverpool led the Champions League in scoring entering the final -- 10 goals better than Real Madrid -- thanks largely to Salah, Mane and Firmino yet it would be the Reds' lone goal of the night in Ukraine. Klopp mused before the game that Real Madrid's substitutes could make a Champions League final themselves and how right he was given Bale's impact. Credit must go to Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane, who called on Bale just at the right time. His first goal had Zidane and Klopp purring.  \"Bale's bicycle kick was unbelievable,\" Klopp said.  The Welshman made it 3-1 in the 83rd when his shot went through Karius. Swerving, yes, but it was from distance and Karius appeared to have a clear view of the left-footed strike. Karius, like Salah, was in tears. The German's came at the final whistle, as he made a gesture of apology to the Liverpool fans decked out in red. Loris Karius was in tears after the Champions League final. Zidane has been under pressure in the Spanish capital due to his team lagging behind bitter rival Barcelona in La Liga. But he has the golden touch in Cup finals, winning all eight he has managed for Real Madrid, while Klopp has lost seven of his eight including his time in Germany.

        "content": "Dublin, Ireland (CNN)Ireland has voted an emphatic \"Yes\" to amend the country's constitution to enable legislation that would allow women to have an abortion in a historic and emotionally charged referendum.With a high turnout of 64.13%, 1,429,98, or 66.4%, voted for the amendment Friday and 723,632, or 33.6%, against, according to the country's Referendum Commission. The results that were announced Saturday defied earlier projections that it would be a tight race.Only one county voted no -- the rural and religiously conservative Donegal in northwest Ireland.  The vote signifies a resounding victory for the government of Leo Varadkar, the Prime Minister, or Taoiseach as the office is called in Ireland.\"Today is a historic day for Ireland,\" Varadkar said at a press conference. \"A quiet revolution has taken place, and today is a great act of democracy.\"Read More\"A hundred years since women gained the right to vote, today we as a people have spoken,\" he said. \"And we say that we trust women and respect women to make their own decisions and their own choices.\" He noted that people in \"almost every county, almost every constituency, men and women, all social classes and almost all age groups\" voted to repeal the amendment. \"We are not a divided country,\" he said.Chants of \"Yes we did\" rose from the crowd as the Referendum Commission's Returning Officer Barry Ryan announced the final results. \"Yes\" supporters wait for the final results Saturday at Dublin Castle.It was a scene of jubilation as some supporters burst into tears. Others began laughing as they hugged one another and asked each other, \"Can you believe we did this?\"Emma Gallagher, 22, began crying as she heard the final results. \"I feel safe now, I feel comfortable,\" she told CNN. \"It felt for a long time women didn't matter. ... Now we know that we matter.\"Rene Wogan, 66, held Gallagher's hand and told her, \"It was all for justice. You're forwarding the flag on for women.\"Thousands of people packed the square in front of Dublin Castle as abortion rights politicians, including Varadkar, also joined the celebration. He told Sky TV he expected legislation to be voted through by the end of the year.\"I feel enormous relief and great pride in the people of Ireland who didn't maybe know what they thought until they were finally asked the questions,\" Ailbhe Smyth, a longtime women's rights activist, told CNN.\"It has been a long and very hard road, but we never lost sight of this because it's so central to the existence, and the selfhood and personhood of women to have that control of our own bodies.\"A woman from the \"Yes\" campaign reacts after final results were announced Saturday at Dublin Castle. The Eighth Amendment, which was added to the constitution following a referendum in 1983, banned abortion in Ireland unless there was a \"real and substantial risk\" to the mother's life.Repeal of the amendment has completed a circle of sweeping social reforms in the European Union nation that fly in the face of the traditional teachings of the Catholic Church, from contraception to divorce, and most recently same-sex marriage. Roscommon, in the rural interior, the only county to say no to same-sex marriage, also voted yes in the abortion referendum. Thousands of Irish working abroad returned to Ireland to cast their vote.

From this point of view that we did not stand up for the most innocent, most weak and most vulnerable in our society, which is the unborn.\"Dr. Ruth Cullen, spokeswoman for the anti-abortion LoveBoth campaign, conceded defeat Saturday before the count had finished.  \"We will hold the Taoiseach to his promise that repeal would only lead to abortion in very restrictive circumstances. He gave his word on this, now he must deliver on it. No doubt many people voted for repeal based on the Taoiseach's promises in this regard,\" Cullen said at a press conference Saturday.In his statement Saturday, Varadkar acknowledged that those who voted against the repeal likely feel that they no longer recognize their country. \"I want to reassure you that Ireland today is the same country as it was last week,\" he said, \"but just a little bit more tolerant, more open and more respectful.\" The death of an Indian dentist ignited the abortion rights campaign in Ireland. Savita Halappanavar, 31, died in 2012  because of complications from a natural miscarriage after abortion was denied to her. Repeal supporters leave notes at a mural of Savita Halappanavar, whose death sparked the campaign.Voters over 65 were the only age group overall not supporting the repeal of the amendment.Ireland's vote will likely put pressure on Northern Ireland to change its abortion laws, too. Despite  Northern Ireland being part of the UK, the 1967 Abortion Act legalizing abortions never applied there, and even victims of rape and incest are forced to travel to mainland Britain if they want a termination.CNN's Kara Fox reported from Dublin, while Hilary Clarke wrote from London and Dakin Andone from Atlanta.

The RTE exit poll shows 69.4% voting \"yes\" and 30.6% \"no.\"Exit polls are not based on the actual counting of ballots. Official counting begins Saturday at 9 a.m. (4 a.m. ET), with the final results expected late afternoon. The Eighth Amendment, which was added to the constitution following a referendum in 1983, places the rights of the fetus and the rights of its mother on equal footing, effectively banning abortion barring a \"real and substantial risk\" to the mother's life.If the referendum ultimately passes, Irish lawmakers are expected to enact legislation allowing for terminations\u00a0in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy -- and later in cases where there is a risk to the mother's life or the fetus is not expected to survive.Read MoreIf early indications are wrong, and a No vote is secured, Ireland's abortion laws -- some of the strictest in the developed world -- will be kept in place.High turnout was seen across 6,500 polling stations in 40 constituencies across the republic Friday. If\u00a0the final turnout, which will be released Saturday, surpasses 60.52%, it will be higher than Ireland's referendum on same-sex marriage, which passed in 2015. Turnout was over 70% in some areas, RTE reported.Posters for both campaigns on a lamppost in Dublin, Ireland.\nThe exit poll showed 69% of men voting and 72.1% of women voting supporting repeal. Support appeared to decrease with age. The exit poll said repeal was supported by 87.6% of voters 18-24 years old; 84.6% of voters 25-34 years old; 72.8% of voters 35-49 years old; and 63.7% of voters 50-64 years old.Voters over 65 were the only age group overall not supporting the amendment, with 58.7% voting no, the poll said.An electorate of more than 3.2 million were eligible to cast their ballots Friday, including thousands of\u00a0Irish people living overseas who had made the journey home to vote. Voters throughout the country were graced with beautiful weather all day, and a mixed atmosphere of excitement and anxiety was felt at polling stations. Jerry Moynihan voted at the Two Mile Community National School in Killarney, in Ireland's rural southwest. He told CNN he was happy to be exercising his democratic right and spoke about how this referendum felt different to him, referencing Ireland's historical connection to the Church.\"It's an important day for Ireland. I think it's a very Irish thing. It isn't the Church anymore that's dictating to us. I think it's a moral thing for the Irish [to decide]. It's not a Catholic thing anymore,\" he said.A voter outside a polling station in Ireland's County Kerry.Caroline Killeen, 52, said she was \"very passionate\" about the vote, adding that she was \"anxious, excited and nervous\" to get the results. \"I think it's important to vote every opportunity you have -- as a woman and as a citizen of whatever country you are in. And, to honor our predecessors and what they fought for us to be able to do this,\" Killeen said.\"I have daughters and just because my ancestors didn't have a vote doesn't mean my daughters shouldn't have a right to their opinion.\"A long campaignAbortion-rights activists who campaigned for a Yes vote Friday have long argued that the Eighth Amendment punishes women and doesn't stop abortions, which are exported -- mostly to the UK -- instead. 'Irish abortions happen; they just don't happen on Irish soil'Their longstanding campaign to repeal the Eighth, as it is commonly known, has made some progress over the past three decades, including the 1992 X Case, which made it legal for Irish women to travel abroad for abortions, adding the threat of suicide as grounds for abortion. In 2013,\u00a0Savita Halappanavar died\u00a0of sepsis after being denied a termination of a miscarrying fetus in a Galway hospital, prompting the government to pass a bill allowing abortions when a woman's life is in danger. And in June 2016, the UN's Human Rights Council\u00a0ruled\u00a0that the country's abortion regime subjected Amanda Mellet, a dual Irish-American national, to \"cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment,\" and called on the Irish government\u00a0to reform its laws. Later that year, in a similar case, the UNHRC ordered that Ireland compensate Siobh\u00e1n Whelan for harm caused to her as a result of the near-total ban on abortion. The young Americans trying to stop Ireland from voting Yes to abortionThroughout the years, Ireland's abortion-rights campaigners have mobilized en masse, with\u00a0demonstrations that have brought Dublin to a halt\u00a0and found support across the globe.Anti-abortion activists who voted No have argued that the Eighth Amendment has saved thousands of lives and encouraged compassionate alternatives to abortion, such as perinatal hospice care when the baby is not expected to survive or adoption for babies born to women in challenging circumstances.The No campaign has also found support from anti-abortion groups worldwide, including some American activists who have traveled to speak at rallies during the campaign.

He described Russia as \"an inalienable part of Europe\" and called for dialogue and trust, saying: \"Let us get around the table to talk about things. If we miss this moment then we really lose it forever.\" His speech followed an address from Vladimir Putin in which the Russian President warned the world was currently experiencing \"a systemic crisis\" in global trade rules, in part because of a \"new era of protectionism.\"Despite sanctions, Putin is pulling the world back to RussiaThe rules that have been built up over decades are being \"broken -- and sometimes very blatantly,\" Putin told an audience that included Macron and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.Read More\"Today we observe not even erosion -- but subversion -- of these foundations,\" Putin said.\"There are more and more classic forms of restriction and we are now talking about a completely new era of protectionism -- and this is all defended by references to national interests and so on. These kind of random sanctions are extremely damaging and more and more attempts are made to circumvent the rules. Worldwide lack of confidence has an effect on growth.\"Putin did not name Donald Trump, but his words could be read as an attack on the US President's threat to impose stiff global tariffs on steel and aluminum exports from Europe and elsewhere.Putin also said Trump was playing to his base by pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal -- but warned the consequences could be bad.\"He is making good on his electoral promises, so he is a victor domestically. But if this deal is destroyed, many will lose,\" Putin said.Europe sticks its thumb in Trump's eye Trump withdrew from the Iranian nuclear accord on May 9. He had long excoriated the deal, claiming it didn't go far enough in deterring Iran's ambitions in the Middle East, or doing anything to curb its ballistic missile program.The United States has said it expects its European allies to follow its lead. However, leaders in Europe and elsewhere have said they intend to stick to the deal, while Russia and Turkey criticized the US decision.In his address, Macron spoke of the need to work in \"the spirit of cooperation\" through existing international platforms, such as the United Nations Security Council and G20. \"Let us make our platforms useful: removing trade tensions and removing barriers. In several months we are going to meet at the G20 summit so let us make this platform useful for the sake of a multilateral approach,\" he said.Macron acknowledged that \"the confidence of the international community is somewhat shaky at the moment\" and that his goals of cooperation and multilateralism \"are far from easy.\" But, he said, \"let us be full of valor and courage to work together, cooperate.\"This year's forum in St. Petersburg has the biggest international lineup since before 2014, when Russia was hit with US and European economic sanctions over its annexation of the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and support of a separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine.",

The young Americans trying to stop Ireland from voting Yes to abortionIn 1992, the X Case made it legal for Irish women to travel abroad for abortions, adding the threat of suicide as grounds for abortion. In 2013, Savita Halappanavar died of sepsis after being denied a termination of a miscarrying fetus in a Galway hospital, prompting the government to pass a bill allowing abortions when a woman's life is in danger. And in June 2016, the UN's Human Rights Council ruled that the country's abortion regime subjected Amanda Mellet, a dual Irish-American national, to \"cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment,\" and called on the Irish government\u00a0to reform its laws.Throughout the years, Ireland's abortion-rights campaigners have mobilized en masse, with demonstrations that have brought Dublin to a halt and found support across the globe.Posters for both campaigns on a lamp post in Dublin, Ireland.\nAnti-abortion activists were voting No, arguing that the Eighth has saved thousands of lives and encouraged compassionate alternatives to abortion, such as perinatal hospice care when the baby is not expected to survive or adoption for babies born to women in challenging circumstances.The No campaign has also found support from anti-abortion groups worldwide, including some American activists who have traveled to speak at rallies.",

The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) -- the governing body of the women's tour -- is considering a rule change which will add protected seedings, as well as protected rankings, for players returning from maternity leave but that won't come into effect until at least next year. In the meantime, the unseeded 36-year-old will face Czech Kristyna Pliskova, the world No. 70,  in the first round and could come up against Sharapova in the fourth round.Though she has only played in two WTA tournaments since her return  -- winning two matches and losing two -- and has not played competitively on clay since losing in the French Open final in 2016, Williams' coach Patrick Mouratoglou is still confident the American can clinch a fourth French Open title. \"Serena will play the French Open to win it,\" Mouratoglou told WTAtennis.com this month. \"Can she do it? Serena can achieve anything - after being her coach for six years, I'm even more sure of that statement.\"Who do you think will win the French Open? Have your say on our Facebook page.

The world No.1 is the bookmakers' favorite, tops the WTA Insider Clay Court Power Rankings and has a 9-3 win-loss record on the surface in 2018. Charleston champion Kiki Bertens, world No.4 Elina Svitolina -- yet to progress beyond the quarterfinals of a grand slam - and Garbine Muguruza, the 2016 champion, are also leading contenders. READ: Hungry for the French Open? Top 10 places to eat in ParisThe incredible 'King of Clay' Photos: The King of Clay over the yearsA lot has changed since a 19-year-old Rafael Nadal became only the second man in history to win Roland Garros at the first attempt. The bulging biceps, long hair and headband remain, but the Spaniard's sense of style has certainly changed.Hide Caption 1 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2005 \u2013 Nadal went into his first French Open as an inexperienced 18-year-old and emerged a grand slam champion -- beating Roger Federer in the semifinals on his 19th birthday. The 2005 season was the birth of what would go on to be Nadal's classic look: sleeveless top and three-quarter length shorts.Hide Caption 2 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2006 \u2013 By the following year, Nadal had cemented his place among tennis' elite and was developing a fearsome reputation on clay. This time wearing a slightly less garish light blue, Nadal picked up his second consecutive French Open title by becoming the first man to beat Roger Federer in a grand slam final.Hide Caption 3 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2007 \u2013 In 2007, the then 20-year-old Nadal's status as the 'King of Clay' was sealed. Defeat to Federer at the Masters Series in Hamburg ended an 81-match unbeaten streak on clay, which remains a men's Open Era record today. At that year's French Open, Nadal opted for the reverse of 2006's top-bandana combo -- this time with matching trainers to boot.Hide Caption 4 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2008 \u2013 A year later, Nadal opted for a variation on his debut French Option look, this time sporting an all-green combo. Nadal reached world No. 1 for the first time in his career in 2008, helped by his fourth consecutive Roland Garros title -- matching Bjorn Borg's record of consecutive trophies, while also becoming only the seventh man to win a grand slam without dropping a set.Hide Caption 5 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2009 \u2013 Nadal's first dramatic transformation came in 2009. Gone were the sleeveless shirts and three-quarter lengths, in came the sleeves and fluorescent, clashing colors. Perhaps it was the sleeves restricting the powerful arms (or maybe a knee injury), but Nadal suffered the first of only two French Open defeats. Despite a shock fourth-round loss to Robin Soderling, Nadal set a record of 31 consecutive wins at Roland Garros.Hide Caption 6 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2010 \u2013 In 2010, Nadal bounced back from the 2009 disappointment with a daring multicolored number. He went on to exact revenge on Soderling, beating him in the final after the Swede had upset Federer in the quarterfinals. Federer's failure to reach the semis meant Nadal regained the world No. 1 spot, while it was also the second time he won the French Open without dropping a set.Hide Caption 7 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2011 \u2013 The following year, Nadal dialed down the brightness, instead choosing to return to one of his earliest Roland Garros styles. And it worked -- he maintained his No. 1 ranking throughout the clay court season and beat perennial rival Federer in the final.Hide Caption 8 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2012 \u2013 Perhaps in an attempt to gain the upper hand on opponents by blending into the clay, Nadal opted for an orange-ish-red look for the first time at the French Open. It appeared to work, as Nadal dropped just 30 games in the first five rounds, before beating Djokovic in four sets in the final to claim his seventh Roland Garros title and surpass Borg as the tournament's most successful player.Hide Caption 9 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2013 \u2013 The 2013 French Open was the debut of Nadal's latest wardrobe change: the short shorts. In an all-Spanish final, Nadal defeated David Ferrer in straight sets -- although bizarrely dropped from fourth in the world to fifth after his victory.Hide Caption 10 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2014 \u2013 Perhaps a sign of entering into his late 20s, Nadal's colors switched from fluorescent to more mellow tones. Despite being hampered by injuries and suffering surprise defeats early in the clay court season, Nadal grinded out arguably his most impressive Roland Garros victory. Another victory in the final against Djokovic took him to 14 grand slams (level with Pete Sampras) and it was his fifth straight French Open triumph.Hide Caption 11 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2015 \u2013 Nadal's struggle to find form continued into 2015's clay court season, dropping outside of the world's top five for the first time since 2005. Looking like an athletic version of the Cookie Monster, Nadal crashed out of the French Open in the quarterfinals to Djokovic. It ended his 39-match unbeaten run and marked just his second defeat on the Parisian clay.Hide Caption 12 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2016 \u2013 The following year, the shorts got even shorter and the two-tone top returned as Nadal exited the French Open in the third round -- although this time it was a wrist injury that defeated him. Despite the disappointment, there was another milestone for Nadal as he became only the eighth man to reach 200 grand slam wins.Hide Caption 13 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2017 \u2013 Nadal debuted his strong blue look against Benoit Paire in the first round and the King of Clay went on to complete \"'La Decima\" of 10 Roland Garros titles.Hide Caption 14 of 14Nadal won a record 10th title at Roland Garros last year -- no player in history has won as many grand slam titles at a single tournament -- so it is of little surprise that the Spaniard is the red-hot favorite.His present form, as well as his past successes, justifies his status as the man to beat on the red dirt. On his way to triumphs in Monte Carlo, Barcelona and Rome on his beloved clay, the 31-year-old recently set the men's record for most consecutive tennis sets won.At Roland Garros, Nadal has only lost to Robin Soderling (2009) and Novak Djokovic (2015), giving him an incredible 79-2 win-loss record on the Parisian clay. \"He's by far the favorite,\" six-time grand slam champion Boris Becker told CNN Sport.\"There are a couple of others coming around the block, but I wouldn't even name them because, in my eyes, if Rafa stays healthy, injury free, I don't see anybody taking it but him.\"The Spaniard will begin his title defence against Ukraine's Alexandr Dolgopolov. READ: Why spring is the best time to visit ParisNadal's likely rivalsZverev is currently ranked third in the worldEven if trying to beat Nadal on clay may be akin to climbing Everest in flip-flops, it is still not impossible to beat the greatest clay court player in history. Alexander Zverev is mentored by his fellow German Becker and has already won two titles this year.The 6-foot-6-inch 21-year-old managed to take a set off Nadal on clay this year and his aggressive, serve-based game offers a contrast to Nadal's brutal baseline play. There's also Dominic Thiem, many people's dark horse. He is the Austrian who ended Nadal's 21-match winning streak on clay at the quarterfinals of the Madrid Open --  Nadal's first loss on clay since defeat by Thiem at the Italian Open last year.

After two years of toil the Serb does seem to have found some form, reaching the semifinals of the Italian Open where he lost to Nadal in two sets. But a second French Open title for the 31-year-old would be a major surprise, especially as the 20th seed has received a tough draw. The former world No.1 could face ATP Finals champion Grigor Dimitrov in the last 16, while Zverev is a potential semifinal opponent. The man who spent 223 weeks as world No.1 is now ranked 22 in the world and is a long way from recapturing the form which brought him 12 grand slam titles. Djokovic, however, told reporters in Rome: \"I believe that one match, one tournament can turn things around... Looking back two or three months, this is the best that I've felt on the court, by far.\" Photos: The faces of Roland Garros 2018The 2018 French Open will take place from May 21-June 10 on the clay courts of Roland Garros in Paris.

Yannick Noah remains the first, and so far, only Frenchman to win a singles title at Roland Garros. It can be a difficult place for a home favorite to please his or her compatriots.

The 2000 champion Mary Pierce -- the only Frenchwoman to win the women's title in the open era -- was the last French Roland Garros finalist, in 2005, and no Frenchman has made it to a final since Leconte in 1988.

            "2006 \u2014 By the following year, Nadal had cemented his place among tennis' elite and was developing a fearsome reputation on clay. This time wearing a slightly less garish light blue, Nadal picked up his second consecutive French Open title by becoming the first man to beat Roger Federer in a grand slam final.",
            "2007 \u2014 In 2007, the then 20-year-old Nadal's status as the 'King of Clay' was sealed. Defeat to Federer at the Masters Series in Hamburg ended an 81-match unbeaten streak on clay, which remains a men's Open Era record today.

            "2013 \u2014 The 2013 French Open was the debut of Nadal's latest wardrobe change: the short shorts. In an all-Spanish final, Nadal defeated David Ferrer in straight sets -- although bizarrely dropped from fourth in the world to fifth after his victory.",
            "2014 \u2014 Perhaps a sign of entering into his late 20s, Nadal's colors switched from fluorescent to more mellow tones.

Another victory in the final against Djokovic took him to 14 grand slams (level with Pete Sampras) and it was his fifth straight French Open triumph.",

Djokovic ended his partnership with tennis legend Andre Agassi in April. Out, too, went the flamboyant, former world No. 8 Radek Stepanek as his coach. Instead, he reunited with long-time coach Marian Vajda, as well as fitness trainer Gebhard \"Phil\" Gritsch. Djokovic's relationship with Agassi had seemed an ideal fit since the American sustained a similar dip in his career before undergoing a renaissance that included three Australian Open titles. Melbourne was Djokovic's  stronghold through 2016. Agassi has also helped thousands of underprivileged children to get an education in Las Vegas, where he resides, and elsewhere in the US, and Djokovic's foundation assists preschool aged children.

Defeat to Federer at the Masters Series in Hamburg ended an 81-match unbeaten streak on clay, which remains a men's Open Era record today. At that year's French Open, Nadal opted for the reverse of 2006's top-bandana combo -- this time with matching trainers to boot.Hide Caption 4 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2008 \u2013 A year later, Nadal opted for a variation on his debut French Option look, this time sporting an all-green combo. Nadal reached world No. 1 for the first time in his career in 2008, helped by his fourth consecutive Roland Garros title -- matching Bjorn Borg's record of consecutive trophies, while also becoming only the seventh man to win a grand slam without dropping a set.Hide Caption 5 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2009 \u2013 Nadal's first dramatic transformation came in 2009. Gone were the sleeveless shirts and three-quarter lengths, in came the sleeves and fluorescent, clashing colors.

It appeared to work, as Nadal dropped just 30 games in the first five rounds, before beating Djokovic in four sets in the final to claim his seventh Roland Garros title and surpass Borg as the tournament's most successful player.Hide Caption 9 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2013 \u2013 The 2013 French Open was the debut of Nadal's latest wardrobe change: the short shorts. In an all-Spanish final, Nadal defeated David Ferrer in straight sets -- although bizarrely dropped from fourth in the world to fifth after his victory.Hide Caption 10 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2014 \u2013 Perhaps a sign of entering into his late 20s, Nadal's colors switched from fluorescent to more mellow tones. Despite being hampered by injuries and suffering surprise defeats early in the clay court season, Nadal grinded out arguably his most impressive Roland Garros victory. Another victory in the final against Djokovic took him to 14 grand slams (level with Pete Sampras) and it was his fifth straight French Open triumph.Hide Caption 11 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2015 \u2013 Nadal's struggle to find form continued into 2015's clay court season, dropping outside of the world's top five for the first time since 2005. Looking like an athletic version of the Cookie Monster, Nadal crashed out of the French Open in the quarterfinals to Djokovic. It ended his 39-match unbeaten run and marked just his second defeat on the Parisian clay.Hide Caption 12 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2016 \u2013 The following year, the shorts got even shorter and the two-tone top returned as Nadal exited the French Open in the third round -- although this time it was a wrist injury that defeated him. Despite the disappointment, there was another milestone for Nadal as he became only the eighth man to reach 200 grand slam wins.Hide Caption 13 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2017 \u2013 Nadal debuted his strong blue look against Benoit Paire in the first round and the King of Clay went on to complete \"'La Decima\" of 10 Roland Garros titles.Hide Caption 14 of 14 Paris breakthrough Despite the promising showing in Rome, a French Open rematch against an in-form Nadal is a different proposition.However, in his pomp, Djokovic tormented Nadal: He compiled a pair of seven-match winning streaks against the Spaniard. And although he faded in the second set in Rome, Djokovic believes there was little to separate him and the \"King of Clay.\" \"I don't think that there was too much of a difference, which is great for me, because Rafa is, of course, the best player ever to play tennis on clay courts,\" said Djokovic. \"I thought the level of my tennis was very high.\"JUST WATCHEDBoris Becker's 1985 Wimbledon quizReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBoris Becker's 1985 Wimbledon quiz 01:30Martin doesn't discount a Djokovic run past the quarterfinals in Paris, assuming he benefits from a gentle start to the fortnight. \"I think the resiliency on the physical side, which leads into the resiliency of the emotional side of things, will dictate his success,\" said Martin, the chief executive of the International Tennis Hall of Fame. \"If he can win his first nine out of 10 sets or similar, then I could see him doing a little bit better\" than the last eight.

In his first Champions League final, the Liverpool defender will not only have to quell Cristiano Ronaldo, one of the greatest players in history, but also keep Real Madrid's myriad of fearsome attacking threats quiet. Follow @cnnsport\n\nThe Croatian has enjoyed an upturn in form this season after well-documented inconsistency since his \u00a320 million ($26m) arrival in 2014.And after helping Liverpool reach the final and finish fourth in the English Premier League, the 28-year-old tells CNN Sport he will be just as confident as Ronaldo when the pair go head-to-head at Kiev's Olimpiyskiy Stadium.\"He's a fantastic player. He's showed already over 12 to 15 seasons that every year he can score,\" Lovren says of Ronaldo, winner of five prestigious Ballon d'Or awards.Read More\"Even if he has a bad season he will score at least 30 goals. \"It will be quite difficult, of course, a big challenge. But I've been working so hard in my life to reach the final of the Champions League and I play week in, week out against the best Premier League strikers in England so I'm ready for that.\"We'll defend like a team. In some moments I will be in situations one against one, but I also have my confidence like he has.\"Who do you think will win the Champions League final? Have your say on our Facebook page. Experience vs. youthVan Djik (left) joined Liverpool for a record \u00a375 million in January and has formed a solid partnership with Lovren.The central defender, whose partnership with January signing Virgil van Djik has helped stabilize Liverpool's rearguard, says he and his teammates are \"ready to fight\" defending champions Real, the most successful team in the competition's history. Last year Real became the first team to win back-to-back Champions League titles and, should they win on Saturday, the Spaniards will become the first team to claim three successive European Cup crowns twice.In Ronaldo, Real have a player who has scored in every Champions League game he has featured this season. The Portugal captain has found the net 25 times in his last 17 Champions League matches and is the only Real player to have played every minute for the La Liga side in this season's tournament. Ronaldo could win the Champions League for a fifth time on Saturday.\"When you want to play in the final of the Champions League then of course you will expect to face one of the best teams in the world,\" added Lovren, who is set to feature for Croatia at this summer's World Cup in Russia. \"Real Madrid are not without reason three times in the final in a row and we need to respect that. \"They have confidence, experience and they know how to play these finals. From our team, for every player it will be our first final, but we are healthy, we are young, and we are ready to fight.\" The contrast in experience is stark. Sergio Ramos, Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, Luka Modric, Karim Benzema, Dani Carvajal, Marcelo and Isco could all appear in their fourth Champions League final for Real, while no-one in Liverpool's squad has played in a Champions League final. READ: Champions League final too costly for fansREAD: How Man City dominated English footballREAD: The greatest Champions League finals'Anything is possible'Liverpool last featured in the final of Europe's most prestigious club competition 11 years ago and have not won the famous trophy since fighting back from 3-0 down to beat AC Milan on penalties in 2005. Saturday's final will be a repeat of the 1981 European Cup final, which Liverpool won 1-0 in Paris. Ominously, or perhaps reassuringly for Liverpool fans, it was the last time Real lost in the final of this competition. Lovren says Liverpool's youthful side will take confidence from beating English Premier League champions Manchester City, Porto and Roma en route to Kiev. They have also been in fine scoring form, netting 46 goals in 14 games this season, surpassing Barcelona's record of 45 in 1999/2000. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features and videos\"In these 90 minutes anything is possible, especially against Real Madrid,\" says Lovren.\"They know how to defend and attack, but when you look back we also played against Man City, Porto, Roma and we showed we can score many goals in the beginning of the half. \"So, definitely it will be an interesting game to watch and, of course, to play and hopefully we can go away with a smile.\"",

Russia has repeatedly denied involvement in the incident. The Buk missile was fired from a farm near Pervomaisk, the Joint Investigation Team into the MH17 disaster told a news conference in the Netherlands.Debris from MH17 sits in a field at the crash site in Ukraine on September 9, 2014.An update posted online by investigators Thursday said the JIT was \"convinced\" that the Buk TELAR (transporter erector launcher and radar) used to down MH17 originated from the 53rd anti-aircraft missile brigade, a unit of the Russian army from Kursk in Russia.The team's conclusion was based on \"extensive comparative research\" that identified characteristics particular to that individual Buk launcher.Read More\"At the time this area was under control of pro-Russian separatists,\" said Fred Westerbeke, chief prosecutor of the National Prosecutor's Office of the Netherlands. The Buk launcher of the 9M38 series \"was transported from the territory of the Russian Federation and was returned to that territory of the Russian Federation afterwards.\"Westerbeke highlighted how \"this raises questions such as to whether the brigade was actively involved in downing MH17. It is an important question which the JIT are still investigating.\"A total of 298 people from 17 countries died when the flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, was brought down in eastern Ukraine in July 2014.A Ukrainian police officer searches for human remains at the crash site in July 2014.The team has also called for witnesses and members of the public to come forward to help identify anyone involved in operating the missile system.\"The authorities of the Russian Federation have, up to now, not reported to the JIT that a Buk of the 53rd brigade was deployed in Eastern Ukraine and that this Buk downed flight MH17,\" Westerbeke said.\"On 15 October 2014 the JIT already asked the Russian authorities to provide the JIT (in line with resolution 2166 of the UN Security Council) with all information that may be important for establishing the truth.\"Because the JIT no longer wants to exclusively turn to the Russian authorities to obtain information about this subject, the JIT also calls in the assistance from the public today -- through the media -- to answer questions that relate to the control of and the use of the Buk TELAR, as well as about the missile that was launched with that TELAR.\"Flowers, soft toys along with pictures are left amongst the wreckage at the site of the crash of  on July 20, 2014.

        "content": "(CNN)Sweden has become the latest European country to recognize sex without mutual consent as rape, passing a bill stipulating that people must consent to sex with clear verbal or physical language and that silence will no longer be interpreted as \"yes\" in sexual encounters. The law, which passed in a 257-38 vote on Wednesday, was hailed by activists as a landslide victory for women's rights in Sweden and around Europe. Sweden joins nine other European countries that have made lack of consent a crime. In most European countries, rape must include violence or threats by the perpetrator. When the Swedish law goes into effect on July 1, prosecutors will no longer need to prove that violence or threats were used in order to obtain a conviction. \n\nActivists hope the new law will have ripple effects across the region. \"Today's vote marks a huge victory for women's rights activists in Sweden who have been campaigning tirelessly for this change for more than a decade,\" said Anna Blus, Amnesty International's women's rights researcher for Europe, in a news release by the organization.Read More\"While there is still a great distance to travel, we are hopeful that today's decision will herald a Europe-wide shift in legislation and in attitudes.\"Anne Ramberg, secretary general of the Swedish Bar Association, was less optimistic, telling CNN that the scope for what is defined as rape in Sweden was already broad enough under pre-existing law. \"This is not a very good idea when it comes to criminalization. We have already extended the legal conception of rape. It includes today a number of activities that from a linguistic point of view do not cover those actions,\" Ramberg told CNN.The passage of the new law comes at a time when reported rape cases have been on the rise in Sweden, increasing 10% in 2017 from the previous year, Johanna Olseryd, project leader of the research department at the National Council on Crime Prevention, told CNN. The law, she and others hope, will change this. \"This law serves to not only prevent sexual predation, but also to radically inform the justice system, to encourage better police investigation, and this will hopefully lead to more and better quality prosecution of rape cases,\" Olga Persson, secretary general of Unizon, an organization representing more than 130 women's shelters around Sweden, told CNN.",

I wanted to fight for Canada.\" READ: Magician, superstar and raconteur -- the life of Brian JacksRead MoreBorn in Nagano, home to the snow monkey and some of Japan's most iconic temples, Deguchi took up judo at the age of just three.Her grandmother was a hairdresser who counted a prominent local sensei among her regular clients. \"He came in to get his haircut and he scouted me,\" Deguchi recalls. \"From that day, I started my judo.\"Deguchi warming up in the dojo growing up in Japan.Her rise up the ranks was swift, with the youngster winning a number of international titles and quickly establishing herself as one of the country's most exciting talents.With the sport returning to its birthplace at the upcoming Olympics, everything seemed to point toward Deguchi representing Japan.Deguchi getting ready for practise aged four.Canada's most decorated judoka, Nicolas Gill, had other ideas.\"We contacted originally five years ago, before she started competing for Japan,\" says Gill, a two-time Olympic medalist who's now the team's high-performance director. \"Her performance at national events in Japan showed signs that she could be a world-class athlete. She chose to represent Japan at that time, but we made it clear that we would always be interested. \"We contacted her a few times over that span of time to validate her interest and finally she accepted to switch.\"Flagbearer Nicolas Gill leads out the Canadian contingent at the Athens 2004 Olympic Opening Ceremony.READ: How the Rio Olympics changed the lives of two refugeesWith countries limited to one athlete per weight category at the biggest competitions, Deguchi was well aware Team Canada gave her the best chance of consistently making the squad.But her final decision was anything but easy. The International Judo Federation (IJF) dictates that dual-nationality athletes who want to represent a new national federation must undergo a three-year period without participating for their former country in IJF competition.It meant Deguchi effectively spent a significant portion of her career in the wilderness, watching on as past and future teammates vied for medals around the world. \u3053\u3093\u306a\u6642\u4ee3\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3002 pic.twitter.com/N1NJP1SL5S\u2014 \u51fa\u53e3\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf (@10CMD29) January 13, 2016\n\n\"We did not see it as a renouncing of Japan, but a confidence in our program and coaches,\" says Gill. \"For us, that an athlete of her level would come from Japan, believing she can perform at the Olympic level with our support, gives us a lot pride.\"An unbeaten returnDeguchi, now 22, returned to the fray at last October's Abu Dhabi Grand Slam in the United Arab Emirates, three years to the day since earning gold for Japan alongside the likes of Hifumi Abe and Sarah Asahina at the junior World Team Championships in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.At February's European Open in Lisbon, Portugal, she won all five of her matches by ippon (the equivalent to a knockout in boxing) en route to gold, defeating Japan's Yuka Watabe along the way. Deguchi vies with former teammates Tsukasa Yoshida in the 2018 Paris Grand Slam final -- a matchup that could be repeated at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.That, though, was just a warm-up for the following week's prestigious Paris Grand Slam -- an event attended by as many as 15,000 people with an atmosphere unparalleled on the IJF calendar.Christa Deguchi career titlesSan Jose 2018 Pan American Championships: Gold (-57kg)Paris Grand Slam 2018: Gold (-57kg)Lisbon 2018 European Open: Gold (-57kg)Chiba 2015 Kodokan Cup: Bronze (-57kg)Fort Lauderdale 2014 Junior Team Championships: Gold (-57kg)Fort Lauderdale 2014 World U21 Championships: Silver (-57kg)All Japan Championships 2014: Bronze (-57kg)Rome European Open 2014: Silver (-57kg) Jeju Grand Prix 2013: Gold (-57kg)Tokyo Grand Slam 2013: Bronze (-57kg)Ljubljana 2013 Junior Team Championships: Gold (-57kg)All Japan U21 Championships 2013: Gold (-52kg)There, an unseeded Deguchi came back to haunt her former charges in style, beating top seed and former teammate Tsukasa Yoshida in the final for the biggest title of her budding career.\"I was happy and so excited because this was my first gold medal at a Grand Slam,\" she says. \"To get that gold medal at Paris -- a big tournament -- I am even happier.\"\"My Canadian teammates were cheering for me. That made me fight even better. If I had to choose one moment in my career I'm most proud of, winning the Paris Grand Slam would be it.\"Gill terms her performances in the French capital \"exceptional,\" but Deguchi has since proven far more than a flash in the pan, taking gold at the Pan American Championships in San Jose, California, and remaining unbeaten this year in a Canadian judogi (uniform).Olympic gold?In the midst of a 19-match winning streak, Deguchi most recently took gold at China's Hohhot Grand Prix on May 25, where qualification for the forthcoming Olympics officially opened. There she beat reigning Olympic champion Rafaela Silva and former compatriot Momo Tamoki en route to the final, only to face a Canadian in the form of teammate Jessica Klimkait.\"Christa and Jessica both absolutely dominated the under-57 kg division,\" said coach Sasha Mehmedovic, after Deguchi won all five of her matches by ippon.\"It was great to see two Canadian flags rise in the same category at the medal ceremony.

Judo Federation (@IntJudoFed) May 25, 2018\n\nDeguchi continues to live and train in Japan, overseeing her own schedule with the help of her former university coaches. A \"quiet and very nice person\" off the mat -- interested in trivia, animals and human physiology --  she is fiercely determined about her ambitions on it. .\"My final goal is to get a medal at the Olympics,\" Deguchi says. \"My hope is to win, that I will get the gold.\"Should the Canadian succeed, it will be the product of a lifetime's dedication and three long years in the cold. A showdown with her former teammates is almost inevitable, given Japan's domination of the event -- something that would previously have been impossible. Gill's mantle as Canada's most successful judoka could already be under threat. Not that he's worried. The closest Gill ever came to Olympic gold was at Sydney 2000, where he was beaten in the final by the great Kosei Inoue.\"My goal as an athlete was always to be Olympic or world champion. I came close a few times, but did not succeed,\" he says. \"As a coach, it was also my goal. [London 2012 bronze medalist] Antoine Valois-Fortier came close but also could not yet win gold.\"Now as director of the whole organization, it is still my goal, so hopefully it will come soon!\"Visit CNN.com/judo for more news and features And if it does, it could happen because a former Japanese judoka made history for the Canadians in Tokyo. \"Judo in Japan is part of the culture. Judo in Canada is a foreign sport,\" says Gill. \"But Canada loves athletes that succeed at the Olympics and loves great personal stories. So all the ingredients are in place to write a great story in Tokyo!\"",

Ireland will vote Friday on whether to repeal the Eighth Amendment to the country's constitution, which says a mother and her fetus have equal rights to life.  'Irish abortions happen; they just don't happen on Irish soil'If Yes wins, Ireland is expected to enact legislation that will allow for terminations up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy. A No vote would keep Ireland's abortion laws -- some of the strictest in the European Union -- in place. Men and women from the Irish diaspora and both sides of the debate have posted about their journeys home on social media under the hashtag #HomeToVote, sharing photos and stories from airports, planes, cars and trains. Lauryn Canny, a Yes voter, tweeted a photo of her passport and boarding pass along with another picture of herself wearing a \"Repeal\" sweatshirt. \"I'm coming #HomeToVote !

        "content": "Story highlightsBig Jake is the tallest horse in the world, according to the Guinness World RecordsAt 17 years old, he is 20 hands, 2.75 inches tall (82.75 inches)Thumbelina, on the other hand, is the world's smallest horse at just 17.5 inches tall. (CNN)Horses come in all shapes, colors and sizes. From the Falabella miniature horse, to the tall British Shire. And just like horses that hold records for being the fastest, there's also a record set for the tallest and the shortest horse. Big Jake became famous in 2012 after he was crowned the tallest in the world by the Guinness World Records. While he's not a Shire, he comes from a breed that's admired as one of the strongest and heaviest among draft horses: the Belgian.\"He was purchased as a foal -- he was probably three -- from a relative of mine and he just grew too big for them,\" Jerry Gilbert explains to CNN Sport. Gilbert and his family own Smokey Hollow Farm in Wisconsin --  they're fifth-generation horse breeders and competitors.Gilbert says when the family set eyes on him, they knew Jake -- now 17 years old -- was one of the biggest horses they'd ever seen. Big Jake is 82.75 inches (210.18cms) tall\"He was a large foal when he was born, he weighed around 240 pounds but he had good genetics -- that's what we look for in breeding draft horses -- we're looking for good conformation and weight.\"Read MoreIt was when he reached the age of around seven or eight that the family realized he could be the tallest in the world.\"We've been with horses our whole lives so we kind of had a good idea what he was, but we wanted to finish showing him before we drew a lot of attention to him.\"I contacted Guinness in 2010 when Jake was around nine. We decided to retire him at that point and he would do occasional competitions if we needed him.\"It was then, that the Guinness World Records measured Jake at an extraordinary 20 hands, 2.75 inches (210.2 centimeters or 82.75 inches) and was officially named the tallest living horse. The average height of a Belgian horse is usually between 16 and 17 hands.\"I've always been interested in the Guinness book of records ever since I was a kid,\" Gilbert says. \"I just never dreamed I'd actually own a horse that would be in there.\"Big Jake made Guinness World Record history in 2010 when he was officially named the tallest living horse.'He's just like a family member'It's not just Big Jake's genetics that the family fell in love with, though.\"He's just like a family member -- he's not just an animal, he's part of our family.#TBT! Check out Big Jake, our amazing record holder for tallest horse living https://t.co/5UJPOt0ZoK #horse pic.twitter.com/6OtMX8Z3YY\u2014 GuinnessWorldRecords (@GWR) 11 November 2016 \"He's got a lot of strength, but he's very docile and he just loves the attention all day long. He wants you to rub him, bathe him, spend a lot of time with him.\"You couldn't ask for a better disposition in a horse than him.\"Gilbert says people are in awe of Jake when they see him in person.\"It's really hard to tell from a picture actually how big he is so people who come here they're just really in awe -- even other horse people that are in the business. \"He's really taken the state of Wisconsin, people know Jake and they really like him a lot. He's got a great disposition and he's really friendly with the crowds that come through here.\"Given his size, it's only natural Big Jake eats double the amount of a normal sized horse. \"We try to ration everything so we'll give him three grain buckets a day -- morning, noon and night. Well give him 24 quarts of oats, vitamins, minerals, different things like that and then he'll eat about approximately a bail a day.\"Maintaining Jake's weight is important, Gilbert says. \"A lot of people try and make their horses put as much weight on as possible which is a terrible thing to do for their joints.\"That might have something to do with the photos. If he weighed another 1,000 pounds he'd look bigger but we just don't want to do that to him. That would be cruel.\"The world's smallest horse, with a big personalityAnd then there's Thumbelina, the world's smallest horse -- a miniature sorrel brown mare.In 2002 she made history with the Guinness World Records after measuring 44.5cms (17.5 in) tall. She was born with dwarfism at Goose Creek Farm in St Louis, Missouri.\"When she was born she literally was 6 inches tall,\" Thumbelina's handler, Michael Goessling, tells CNN Sport. \"I thought there was a possum in the stall -- it was just so tiny and then all of a sudden she stood up and I couldn't believe what I was seeing.\"     \"To put it into perspective, a miniature foal when born is typical 19 or 20 inches tall and Thumbelina has never achieved that height,\" he adds.Owners Kay and Paul Goessling were concerned about Thumbelina's health as she was born with dwarfism, however Goessling says she proved everyone wrong and has been healthy ever since. Thumbelina's handler says the small horse seems unaware of her size and often takes charge around the farm. She's also completely unaware of her size.\"From day one she never really came to have the full appreciation of how tiny she actually is. She's been absolutely fearless,\" Goessling says.He remembers when the Guinness World Records team came out to do a photoshoot with Thumbelina and had brought the tallest horse at the time along with them.Thumbelina is just 17.5 inches (44.5cms) tall.\"We brought Thumbelina out on a lead and they had 'Radar' -- the tallest horse -- there and Thumbelina all of a sudden reared up, bit him right on the nose and Radar started running away!\"She stands her ground and she doesn't take anything from other horses but at the same time she's always been so sweet and calm and tender with kids.\"Thumbelina is officially described as a dwarf horse.Early on the Goessling's decided to turn Thumbelina into a therapy animal. \"She visited cancer patients, burn patients, they were kids that were really struggling -- sometimes emotionally -- and they'd have that moment with Thumbelina. I had more parents come up to me with tears in their eyes saying it was literally the happiest moment of their child's life.\"(Thumbelina) seems to have this ability to know the situation because these kids they'll hug her and pull on her and rub her ears and she just sits there and takes it and she'll nuzzle them.\"Now 17, Thumbelina lives a quiet life on the farm, sleeping in the dog house -- using a set of doggy doors to get in and out of the barn.\"She comes and goes as she likes and she just lives in her own little Thumbelina world that has been created for her over the years.\"",

        "content": "Dublin (CNN)Emily Faulkner is in central Dublin, handing out leaflets featuring fetuses in various stages of development, when she's pelted by an egg. Covered in yolk, she turns to her fianc\u00e9, Nathan Berning, who has a GoPro video camera mounted on his chest.\"Did you get that on tape? Is it on, babe? Turn it on,\" she says.As Faulkner wipes the mess from her face, a fellow anti-abortion campaigner approaches her, saying she'll be calling the police to have a look.\"Ok,\" Faulkner says with a smile. \"I'm excited.\"Read MoreWith just days until Ireland votes in a referendum on whether to repeal the Eighth Amendment to the constitution -- which places the right to life of an unborn child on equal footing with that of the mother -- campaigners have become increasingly confrontational in their tactics.If a majority vote Yes on Friday, Ireland is expected to enact legislation that will allow for terminations up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy. A No vote would keep the country's abortion laws -- some of the most restrictive in the developed world -- in place.  But not all of those targeting voters with leaflets, placards and social media posts are Irish.Emily Faulkner canvassing on Dublin's Dame street on May 14.  \n Faulkner, 23, and Berning, 25, are founders of the Colorado-based anti-abortion group Let Them Live. They've travelled to Ireland for the month leading up to the historic poll to \"sway the voters to vote pro-life and hopefully keep Ireland pro-life.\" \"Basically it's a Roe v. Wade, but Irish style,\" Faulkner told a group of American students she was attempting to recruit for the journey, referring to the landmark 1970s court case that made it legal for women across the United States to have abortions.    When the couple (both associated with the US-based conservative nonprofit The Leadership Institute) launched a $10,000 crowdfunding campaign to finance the trip, they had written they'd be volunteering with Ireland's Pro Life Campaign. But after they experienced an \"unexpected\" backlash from Irish pro-repeal groups, who said they weren't welcome and threatened to report them to immigration, they changed that description, removing any mention of joining the campaign in an official capacity.American anti-abortion campaigners (from left) Benyam Capel, Nathan Berning, Emily Faulkner, Chase Howell and Nicole Hocott in Dublin last week. \"We were deathly afraid we were going to get turned away at the gate,\" says Berning, and \"wanting to make sure that people didn't feel threatened by us coming.\"Groups dedicated to repealing the Eighth Amendment described the couple's tactics as deceptive.Faulkner said she and Berning arrived at Dublin airport in early May and told immigration officers they \"had no specific plans for the trip other than documenting\" the campaign. Once they were let through the airport gates, the pair began to mobilize, designing canvassing materials they described as \"information outreach\" that another member would carry to Ireland from the US.The members of Let Them Live are not the only Americans supporting the anti-abortion movement here.One branch of the national pro-repeal group Together for Yes told CNN its members have heard American accents on their doorsteps. LoveBoth, a prominent \"No\" campaign group, brought over Claire Culwell, an American activist who calls herself an \"abortion survivor\" to speak at its rallies across the country in April.Faulkner wears an Irish 'Vote NO' badge on her Let Them Live shirt. Faulkner says the group's shirts were designed in pink to \"reappropriate the color pink back from Planned Parenthood.\"\n That's a sore subject for the members of Let Them Live, who had been hoping to work in a more official capacity with the No campaign.\"I think there's just a paranoia,\" Berning explained of the reasons why No campaigners didn't want to get involved with his group. \"They don't want to break any rules. For us, it sucks because we want to help them, but for them, they're being smart ... maybe.\" Under Irish law, foreign citizens and groups are not allowed to make any financial donations to Irish campaign groups. However, it is unclear if Let Them Live would have been allowed to campaign officially with the No campaign in a voluntary capacity.Although the Irish government states that \"you need a Volunteer Visa to come to Ireland to do voluntary work, eg for a charity, non-profit or voluntary organisation,\" data obtained by CNN shows that no Americans are currently on those visas. Ireland's Department of Justice and Equality told CNN \"volunteering 'per se' is not prohibited by law for those in Ireland on valid holiday visas.\"   Nathan Berning speaks to an Irish voter in central Dublin. Berning says the group's members wears GoPros for their \"safety\" and to help record conversations for a documentary they are making.\n Some Irish are outraged by foreign groups like Let Them Live, arguing that American campaigners are using their vacations to stage a proxy war on women's rights in their country. 'Irish abortions happen; they just don't happen on Irish soil'M\u00e1ire\u00e1d Enright, an Irish abortion rights campaigner and senior lecturer in law at the University of Birmingham in England, is more skeptical of their reach.\"I don't have a legal objection to it but it strikes me as a poor educational experience,\" she said.\"I would wonder about how they justify it -- whether they justify it as a human rights campaign or whether they are justifying it as a free trip to the 'old country' in which they will engage in politics that I would imagine they would have very little direct personal understanding of.\"\"Personal engagement on a local level has always been crucial to Irish politics, so that kind of butting in is very difficult to do effectively. So the idea that a foreign group would think they would have much of an impact in the way of direct canvassing strikes me as terribly naive.\"Related: A baby's murder opened a dark chapter in Ireland that still hasn't been closedOn an overcast morning, the Americans huddled in prayer outside a city council building.They were there to attend and film an abortion rights campaign event.Berning films Ireland's Minister for Health, Simon Harris campaign for a Yes vote inside a Dublin City Council building on May 14.\nInside, members of Let Them Live filed into front seats, where they listened to a panel of abortion rights activists speak about the harm they believe the Eighth Amendment causes to women.Ireland's Health Minister warned about a \"fog\" of misinformation being used to \"conflate\" and \"confuse\" voters. A video played, featuring parents of a pregnant woman who traveled for a termination after being told her baby wouldn't survive outside the womb. They appealed for compassion. \"You cannot judge people's actions and say you have the solutions,\" the woman in the video said.As the event wrapped up, Berning exchanged his video camera for a packet of Let Them Live flyers. He laid them out on the panelists' table as one of the group's members, Benyam Capel, was asked to stop filming with a concealed palm-size camera.US government employee Benyam Capel, 22. He told Irish immigration he was traveling for pleasure, \"because I enjoy activism.\"They regrouped outside, where Faulkner and other members began to distribute flyers to passersby until building security informed them that leafleting on city council grounds was prohibited.Berning questioned that.\"Oh, that wouldn't be true, because they have the constitutional right to freedom of speech,\" he said.But laws in Ireland differ greatly from those in the US. And for some Irish, who fear foreign influence on their political process, it is this attitude that is worrisome.The self-described \"pro-life warriors\" then took to a central Dublin street, where their flyers were met with mixed reactions, perhaps an indication of the latest voter intentions. Recent polls suggest the Yes campaign is ahead, but only slightly. Berning handed a flyer to a woman who was walking briskly through the street with her partner. After glimpsing at the flyer, she then paused before ripping it up slowly.The group was also met with more positive responses, including a mother who politely smiled as she explained she already understood the various stages of embryonic development. Another man told them he wasn't interested in flyers but would be voting No because he didn't trust politicians.

Is this wanted [here]? Its slightly off, if you know what I mean.\"Ireland's referendum is taking place in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica revelations, the Brexit \"Vote Leave\" finance scandal and continued fallout surrounding alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US election. Irish politicians are struggling to come to terms with the far-reaching impact social media can have on elections, while real-time indicators of foreign interference have sparked fears among transparency groups that Ireland could also be vulnerable to a similar fate as its neighbors to the east and west.Although Irish law bans foreign donations to campaigns, regulations around foreign advertising online don't exist. This effectively leaves Facebook, Google and Google-owned YouTube as prime campaigning grounds for anyone wishing to run an ad, regardless of location. 'Dark ads' cast a shadow over Ireland's referendum on abortionIrish lawmaker James Lawless first put forward a Social Media Transparency Bill in December 2017, with the aim to reduce the risk of foreign actors influencing upcoming campaigns. The bill was rejected last year, but it's now being reconsidered as the decisions of the two American tech giants have brought international attention to Ireland's electoral integrity.In early May, Facebook said it would ban foreign-bought ads related to the vote, while Google paused all ads related to the referendum.Pro-repeal groups applauded the decision, saying it would level the playing field.Anti-abortion groups said the move was evidence of a \"rigged\" election and a clampdown on free speech that would effectively \"silence\" their campaign.Berning views Facebook's move to ban foreign-bought ads related to the referendum as censorship.  \nBerning, who runs a tech startup and worked on former US presidential candidate Ben Carson's campaign, told CNN that Let them Live's Facebook page had been \"unfairly\" banned from posting material targeting an Irish audience, although a \"few have slipped through.\"And those loopholes are popping up across the platform.The Transparency Referendum Initiative (TRI), a volunteer organization set up to monitor social media posts about the referendum, found at least 31% of new ads captured in the week after Facebook's announcement were administered at least in part by page managers outside Ireland, with a disproportionate amount of them connected to the No campaign.Meanwhile, some US-based anti-abortion groups have been able to continue running ads on their Facebook pages that have targeted Irish voters directly.One of them, the controversial New York-based Expectant Mother Care (EMC) FrontLine Pregnancy Centers, ran at least 10 anti-abortion ads targeting Irish voters following Facebook's announcement. Its founder is currently visiting Ireland in the lead-up to the vote.While that battle continues to rage online, the Let Them Live members are hoping their efforts on the ground can help sway voters.  A confident Berning held a handful of flyers as he walked down a riverside promenade flanked with Yes and No campaign posters.\"Turns out nothing we were originally planning on doing was illegal at all,\" he said, adding that the group's plan for the final days of campaigning was to canvass highways and town centers with 5,000 posters they had printed in Ireland.\"It'll kind of be like if we're promoting a concert!\" Faulkner said.The posters, which feature a picture of a fetus at 12 weeks, read \"Say NO to abortion on demand.\"\"It doesn't say 'vote No' or 'vote Yes,'\" she added.",

Astronomical costs of flights, accommodation and tickets have forced some to conjure creative ways to get to Kiev this weekend and though it will be an adventure for many, they are far from happy. Follow @cnnsport\n\nFor Gareth Roberts, editor of the Liverpool fanzine the Anfield Wrap, his will be a two-day journey driving through five countries -- France, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany and Poland -- in a coach to reach the Ukrainian capital in time for European football's showpiece event, which starts at 19:45 BST on May 26. Comfort and personal hygiene, he jokes, must be sacrificed to witness the English Premier League side attempt to win a sixth European title. Yet even this cheaper option will set the 41-year-old back \u00a31,000 ($1,345).Read More\"The whole thing has been an absolute joke,\" the Liverpudlian tells CNN Sport. \"We're leaving Liverpool at 2am Thursday, driving down to Kent, getting on the Eurostar, getting over to France, then it's through Belgium, Holland, Germany -- stopping in Berlin -- and through Poland into Ukraine.\"We'll stop somewhere else in Ukraine, about 100 miles from Kiev, stay at a hostel, have four hours' sleep, get a shower, then get back and carry on.

On the same website, a guesthouse apartment for one person for May 26 was \u00a34,226 ($5,686). Rooms were unavailable at the time of searching in one of Kiev's plushest establishment, the InterContiental Kiev. So expensive is the accommodation that generous Kiev residents have mobilized on social media to offer spare rooms and sofas to fans for free. Meanwhile, a flight to Kiev from London Gatwick on May 25, returning on Sunday May 27, was \u00a31,214 ($1633) when searching SkyScanner on Monday.

Liverpool had to organize a ballot to allocate tickets to fans.\"It all feels unfair that they (a) can't put it in a bigger venue and (b) in a city that's got better infrastructure to cope. \"There's been rooms advertised on the internet for \u00a310,000 ($13,473). Going in the van is the only way we can do it. \"You only have to go online and type in Champions League tickets and you find them from anything from \u00a3500 ($672) to \u00a34,000 ($5382). \"Even through UEFA, they were selling tickets for \u00a3394 ($530).

A Real Madrid football team fan holds a replica of the Champions League trophy.The estimated gross commercial revenue of UEFA's European competitions -- the Champions League, Europa League and Super Cup -- during the 2017-18 season is approximately 2.35 billion euros ($2.78 billion), according to European football's governing body. Spirit of Shankly, the Liverpool supporters' union, said the final would be \"surely the most expensive club competition final ever.\"In a statement, the union criticized the governing body, saying: \"With their huge wealth, amassed from TV rights and sponsorship deals, how can they justify charging fans up to \u00a3394 per ticket? \"Aside from the kindness of individuals wanting to help fans, what we have seen is a brazen rip-off with pre-booked hotels canceled and made available again for twice the price.\"The union claimed Thomas Cook, Liverpool's travel partner which was chartering four flights from Liverpool John Lennon Airport to Kiev, had deliberately increased prices.

For example, at the final in 2014 in Lisbon with a stadium capacity of 61,000, the finalists received 17,000 tickets each,\" the spokesperson said. Defending champions Real Madrid were allocated 892 fewer tickets for Kiev than they did for last year's final in Cardiff. The club says 24,268 season-ticket holders applied for the 12,802 Kiev tickets made available to fans by the club via a lottery but, according to the Independent, more than 2,000 Real fans have returned their tickets because of cost. For the fans who planned ahead and had supreme belief in their team, however, they will travel to Kiev at a fraction of the cost of those who waited until the conclusion of the semifinals. Nacho Vignote, a Real season-ticket holder for 18 years, booked his flight and accommodation in September. His confidence is perhaps understandable as this is Real's third final in four years.In 2017 Real became the first team in Champions League history to win back-to-back titles. Vignote's flight from Madrid cost 100 euros ($118) -- the cheapest flight departing Madrid on May 25 and returning on May 27 was \u00a3466 ($627) on SkyScanner on Tuesday. He and nine friends have not had to dig deep for accommodation either as they are renting an apartment for four nights for 1,000 euros ($1,181). \"I try to book some months in advance and if Real reach the final then perfect for me and if not it's a nice weekend in a city,\" he tells CNN Sport. \"This year fewer Real fans have applied for tickets, about four times less. The club is still calling for people on the waiting list because a lot of people have rejected tickets. \"The fans are angry with UEFA for the location they have chosen for the final. The cost is because of the location. If it had been anywhere in central Europe it'd be completely different.\"And all the tickets are just for VIPs and UEFA. This is a party for UEFA instead of a party where fans can go at an affordable price. The real fans have to either stay at home or spend a lot of money.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)It's a story involving an alleged drugs violation and Inca mummies that's enraged a South American nation about to make its first World Cup appearance since 1982.Thousands have taken to the streets of Peru in protest and three rival national team captains have signed a letter calling for leniency in the case of the Peruvian forward Paolo Guerrero.Peru's all-time top scorer is presently banned from the Russia 2018 World Cup after testing positive for the cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine, following a World Cup qualifying match away to Argentina in October 2017. Initially banned for a year by FIFA -- the substance is on the World Anti-Doping Agency's prohibited list -- Guerrero protested his innocence, contending the metabolite was only found in his system as a consequence of a simple cup of coca tea, a common drink in South America. Guerrero, left, is greeted by hordes of Peru fans in Lima.In court, Guerrero's lawyers invoked the story of three Inca mummies -- the Children of Llullaillaco --  discovered by mountaineers in 1999.Read MoreThe mummies' perfectly-preserved bodies had gone undisturbed since the 16th Century and contained traces of the same substance -- despite cocaine only being isolated as psychoactive alkaloid hundreds of years later.If the metabolite could hang around on a person for centuries before cocaine even existed, surely, the lawyers argued, an adverse finding in Guerrero's case wasn't so unusual. The player posted on his Facebook page in November: \"I trust that the truth will soon be known and I will return to the fields to defend with soul and heart the colors of my country.\"Guerrero is a two-time Copa America golden boot winner and currently plays his club football for Flamengo in Brazil.On 20 December 2017, FIFA reduced Guerrero's ban to what it considered a \"proportionate sanction\" of six months, meaning Peru's talismanic captain would get a chance to play in the World Cup.Job done, or so it appeared, as Peru manager Ricardo Gareca named the 34-year-old in his provisional squad on May 14.The World Anti-Doping Agency Agency had other ideas. Later that day, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) announced it had decided to increase the suspension from six to 14 months, as WADA sought to impose a stricter ruling.  CAS accepted that Guerrero \"did not attempt to enhance his performance by ingesting the prohibited substance,\" adding there was no \"significant fault or negligence,\" but the court's panel insisted the player could have taken measures to prevent the violation.Guerrero had also taken his case to CAS, seeking to prove his innocence once and for all. The verdict left him back at square one. Peru players wore t-shirts proclaiming their support for Guerrero ahead of a friendly match against Scotland on May 29 in Lima.Rivals join forcesIt's a decision that has prompted uproar in his native country and beyond.Newly-appointed president Martin Vizcarra vowed to support Guerrero's case, lobbying the Peruvian embassy in Switzerland. Thousands crowded onto the streets of Lima donned in Peru's national colors with placards and banners protesting Guerrero's innocence.FIFPro, the sports world players' union, called for an \"urgent\" meeting with FIFA, calling the ban \"unfair and disproportionate.\"Peru's Argentine coach Ricardo Gareca protests the 14-month sanction in a press conference.Hugo Lloris, Mile Jedinak and Simon Kjaer --  captains of France, Australia and Denmark respectively -- signed a letter dated May 21 calling for FIFA to show \"compassion\" and \"temporarily interrupt\" the ban.  \"Peru is returning to football's ultimate stage after a 36-year absence and we believe Paolo Guerrero should be allowed to lead his nation and celebrate what will be a career highlight,\" says the letter, addressed to the FIFA General Secretariat.

There's still some time to look at whether there are any technical errors in the legal procedure which might give rise to the idea of delaying the suspension until after the World Cup. \"FIFA still has a vested interest in looking at whether or not there is a solution here, because the public outcry has been enormous.\" 'Trapped in the pitfalls of the system'Whatever happens to Guerrero, the wider implications of the case could be significant, according to FIFPro.\"The current anti-doping system requires reforms on different fronts,\" Director of Policy and Strategic Affairs, Jonas Baer-Hoffman, told CNN on May 22.Peru's Raul Ruidiaz, Jefferson Farfan and Miguel Trauco hold aloft Guerrero's jersey during his absence. \"The last years have proven that the system is ineffective and at the same time very invasive to the rights of athletes, who too often get trapped in the unjust pitfalls of the system. Athletes should be the first stakeholder to build a system for a clean sport.\"We fail to see the purpose and benefit for our sport of such a sanction. The tribunals recognized there was no intent by Paolo Guerrero to cheat. Mandatory sanctions, with such severe consequences, do not help the fight against doping and rob a player of the pinnacle of his career.\"Orsatti calls Guerrero a \"sacrificial lamb,\" stressing the need for \"a new collective bargaining agreement between WADA, the International Olympic Committee and FIFA, to make the rules fair and proportionate to the specifics of this sport. \"Unfortunately when it comes to change, reform and adjusting something which just isn't right, it always takes someone to suffer -- something of a sacrificial lamb,\" said Orsatti. \"In this case we're seeing Guerrero being the one being caught in the firing line. Even though you have no intent to cheat -- which everyone agrees around the case -- you are still banned according to the doping rules for one to two years.\" JUST WATCHED'Glimmer of hope' Guerrero plays World CupReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'Glimmer of hope' Guerrero plays World Cup 02:19FIFPro proposes an alternative anti-doping system that protects both the sport's integrity and the athletes going forward.\"Other sports especially in the United States have proven that in cooperation with the athletes, organized in their unions, effective, fair and strong anti-doping systems can be built,\" said Baer-Hoffman.\"We would like to see the start of a process with the other stakeholders to build a system which effectively protects sports' integrity and does not leave athletes exposed to situations as faced by Paolo Guerrero at this moment.\"A WADA spokeperson told CNN the agency was in the midst of a \"three-phase review process\" of its rules, arguing CAS had delivered a decision \"in line\" with their current guidelines.\"One of the strengths of the Code is that it is constantly evolving and improving,\" said the WADA statement. \"In December 2017, WADA launched the first of a three-phase review process of the Code that will come to an end in November 2019 and which will also involve review of the International Standards. This is the third review of the Code, which ensures that the document continues to protect clean athletes effectively and fulfills the needs of the anti-doping community.\"Visit CNN.com/sport for more news and featuresAny changes to the current rules will come far too late for Guerrero, with the final deadline for national squads set for June 4.\"WADA think there's a once-size-fits-all approach,\" said Orsatti. \"Well a once-size-fits-all approach never suited anyone, and this is where the problem occurred.\"",

        "content": "Paris (CNN)France's public services ground to a halt Tuesday as civil servants across the country went on strike against President Emmanuel Macron's proposed economic reforms.The action is the third nationwide strike since Macron began his five-year term in May last year, promising to slash public spending and inject new life into the economy. Fifteen people have been arrested and two shop windows vandalized during protests, police told CNN.All nine major public-sector unions were taking part in the action, in a rare show of unity not seen in the country for a decade. Around 130 separate strikes were scheduled to take place, Axel Persson from the CGT union's rail workers branch told CNN. Civil servants demonstrate in Marseille, southern France.\"It's important to strike because Macron is implementing an agenda that aims at destroying all the benefits conquered throughout the past half-century: pensions, protections against unfair dismissal, terms and conditions in both private and public sector,\" Persson said. Read More\"If he gets his way, we will be back to square one in terms of workers' rights in France.\"The strike began as an action for the country's rail workers, but soon broadened to include much of the civil service, including teachers and hospital staff. Air traffic controllers have also joined, grounding dozens of flights. A protester wearing a T-shirt reading \"Angry sewer worker\" in Lyon.The French aviation authority said it had asked airlines to cut 20% of flights to and from Orly, which serves the capital, Marseille and Lyon.Among the most contentious of the proposed reforms are 120,000 administrative job cuts and the shift of some permanent roles to a contract basis. There would also be major changes to state-owned rail company SNCF, which has struggled for years with debt.Demonstrators carry a banner reading \"Macron No\" during a strike in Paris.Rail workers Romain and Christophe, who did not want to give their surnames, traveled from the southern town of B\u00e9ziers to Paris to take part in the march. \"We don't want the state to close railway lines or to end the special status the rail workers benefit from. That's why we're here today,\" Romain told CNN at the Place de la R\u00e9publique in the capital, as music blared and vendors sold hot dogs, beer and wine to marchers.Some of Macron's proposals aim to create competition to the country's passenger rail industry, which currently works as a monopoly, and to remove some of the protections in rail workers' contracts, such as the guarantee of a job for life.Nurses, from left, Martine, Carmen, Lise and Eliane warn against health service cuts.A group of four nurses said they wanted to warn Macron against cutting funding and jobs in the health service.\"We have less people who are able to help and more people who are sick. We need more funding. The government shouldn't touch the hospitals or education -- they should be sacred,\" said one nurse, Martine, who asked that only her first name be used.",

The brochure, titled \"Om krisen eller kriget kommer (If crisis or war comes),\" was compiled by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) and instructs civilians on what to do if \"their everyday life was turned upside down.\"The brochure provides information on everything from how to identify fake news and prepare against extreme weather conditions to what to do in the event of terror attacks and military conflicts.

But the pamphlet warns the populace not to become complacent.\"If Sweden is attacked by another country, we will never give up. All information to the effect that resistance is to cease is false,\" the pamphlet says in a statement highlighted by a red background. The pamphlet is prompted partly by the \"security situation in our neighborhood,\" meaning the Baltic area, a Civil Contingencies Agency spokesman told CNN in January 2018. The pamphlet's republication comes as the security debate on whether Sweden will join NATO has intensified following alleged Russian violations of Swedish airspace and territorial waters.

He's only lost to Sweden's Robin Soderling in the fourth round  in 2009 and Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinal in 2015. Can anyone beat Nadal? Have your say on our Facebook pageJUST WATCHEDRed clay and no roof: The unique Roland GarrosReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRed clay and no roof: The unique Roland Garros 02:35Read MorePlus, Nadal has been busy adding to his trophy haul on clay in the buildup, triumphing in Monte Carlo, Barcelona and then the Italian Open in Rome Sunday. \"Rafa is for me a clear-cut favorite to win No. 11,\" six-time grand slam winner Boris Becker, who was coaching Djokovic when the Serb downed Nadal in Paris three years ago, told CNN Sport. \"He's by far the favorite. There are a couple of others coming around the block, but I wouldn't even name them because in my eyes if Rafa stays healthy, injury free, I don't see anybody taking it but him.\" But if there is to be a monumental upset at the French Open, who might be on the other side of the net? Start with this quintet, which doesn't include the absent Roger Federer. READ: Nadal 'living with pain and painkillers since 2005'READ: The Decima for Rafa in Paris Photos: The King of Clay over the yearsA lot has changed since a 19-year-old Rafael Nadal became only the second man in history to win Roland Garros at the first attempt. The bulging biceps, long hair and headband remain, but the Spaniard's sense of style has certainly changed.Hide Caption 1 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2005 \u2013 Nadal went into his first French Open as an inexperienced 18-year-old and emerged a grand slam champion -- beating Roger Federer in the semifinals on his 19th birthday. The 2005 season was the birth of what would go on to be Nadal's classic look: sleeveless top and three-quarter length shorts.Hide Caption 2 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2006 \u2013 By the following year, Nadal had cemented his place among tennis' elite and was developing a fearsome reputation on clay. This time wearing a slightly less garish light blue, Nadal picked up his second consecutive French Open title by becoming the first man to beat Roger Federer in a grand slam final.Hide Caption 3 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2007 \u2013 In 2007, the then 20-year-old Nadal's status as the 'King of Clay' was sealed. Defeat to Federer at the Masters Series in Hamburg ended an 81-match unbeaten streak on clay, which remains a men's Open Era record today. At that year's French Open, Nadal opted for the reverse of 2006's top-bandana combo -- this time with matching trainers to boot.Hide Caption 4 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2008 \u2013 A year later, Nadal opted for a variation on his debut French Option look, this time sporting an all-green combo. Nadal reached world No. 1 for the first time in his career in 2008, helped by his fourth consecutive Roland Garros title -- matching Bjorn Borg's record of consecutive trophies, while also becoming only the seventh man to win a grand slam without dropping a set.Hide Caption 5 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2009 \u2013 Nadal's first dramatic transformation came in 2009. Gone were the sleeveless shirts and three-quarter lengths, in came the sleeves and fluorescent, clashing colors. Perhaps it was the sleeves restricting the powerful arms (or maybe a knee injury), but Nadal suffered the first of only two French Open defeats. Despite a shock fourth-round loss to Robin Soderling, Nadal set a record of 31 consecutive wins at Roland Garros.Hide Caption 6 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2010 \u2013 In 2010, Nadal bounced back from the 2009 disappointment with a daring multicolored number. He went on to exact revenge on Soderling, beating him in the final after the Swede had upset Federer in the quarterfinals. Federer's failure to reach the semis meant Nadal regained the world No. 1 spot, while it was also the second time he won the French Open without dropping a set.Hide Caption 7 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2011 \u2013 The following year, Nadal dialed down the brightness, instead choosing to return to one of his earliest Roland Garros styles. And it worked -- he maintained his No. 1 ranking throughout the clay court season and beat perennial rival Federer in the final.Hide Caption 8 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2012 \u2013 Perhaps in an attempt to gain the upper hand on opponents by blending into the clay, Nadal opted for an orange-ish-red look for the first time at the French Open. It appeared to work, as Nadal dropped just 30 games in the first five rounds, before beating Djokovic in four sets in the final to claim his seventh Roland Garros title and surpass Borg as the tournament's most successful player.Hide Caption 9 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2013 \u2013 The 2013 French Open was the debut of Nadal's latest wardrobe change: the short shorts. In an all-Spanish final, Nadal defeated David Ferrer in straight sets -- although bizarrely dropped from fourth in the world to fifth after his victory.Hide Caption 10 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2014 \u2013 Perhaps a sign of entering into his late 20s, Nadal's colors switched from fluorescent to more mellow tones. Despite being hampered by injuries and suffering surprise defeats early in the clay court season, Nadal grinded out arguably his most impressive Roland Garros victory. Another victory in the final against Djokovic took him to 14 grand slams (level with Pete Sampras) and it was his fifth straight French Open triumph.Hide Caption 11 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2015 \u2013 Nadal's struggle to find form continued into 2015's clay court season, dropping outside of the world's top five for the first time since 2005. Looking like an athletic version of the Cookie Monster, Nadal crashed out of the French Open in the quarterfinals to Djokovic. It ended his 39-match unbeaten run and marked just his second defeat on the Parisian clay.Hide Caption 12 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2016 \u2013 The following year, the shorts got even shorter and the two-tone top returned as Nadal exited the French Open in the third round -- although this time it was a wrist injury that defeated him. Despite the disappointment, there was another milestone for Nadal as he became only the eighth man to reach 200 grand slam wins.Hide Caption 13 of 14 Photos: The King of Clay over the years2017 \u2013 Nadal debuted his strong blue look against Benoit Paire in the first round and the King of Clay went on to complete \"'La Decima\" of 10 Roland Garros titles.Hide Caption 14 of 14Novak Djokovic Djokovic isn't the player he was in 2016, when he won the French Open to become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to land four consecutive majors. A loss of focus, intensity and an elbow injury that necessitated surgery this year have all contributed to -- by his standards -- a worrying slump. READ: Djokovic loses to Chung in MelbourneHowever, Djokovic has been Nadal's toughest opponent throughout his career -- still holding a winning head-to-head record and beating him seven times on clay. No one else comes close. Novak Djokovic. Sketch by Gianluca Costantini. And he was encouraged by his outing against Nadal in the Rome semifinals Saturday. Djokovic tested Nadal prior to succumbing 7-6 (7-4) 6-3. In an indication of the uneasiness Nadal feels when confronting Djokovic, he was often passive and initially let slip a 5-2 lead in the first set. If they do square off again at the French Open, 12-time grand slam winner Djokovic will surely have benefited from playing Nadal in the Eternal City, despite the end result. It was their first clash since Madrid last year, and the gap was much less than it has been at times. Djokovic's stint in Rome marked his first semifinal, too, since the Wimbledon warmup of Eastbourne last June. He has reunited with the most influential coach in his career, Marian Vajda, after splitting with tennis legend Andre Agassi and former top-10 pro Radek Stepanek.  But at this stage of his comeback, does Djokovic have it in him to beat Nadal over the best-of-five sets? Rafael Nadal. Sketch by Gianluca Costantini. Dominic ThiemNadal has only lost 36 times on clay in a top-flight career spanning about 13 years. But Austria's Thiem is one of three players to have bettered the Mallorcan on clay at least three times, following 2004 French Open winner Gaston Gaudio and Djokovic. It was Thiem who ended Nadal's set streak in Madrid this month. The 24-year-old Thiem is an electrifying shotmaker and clay gives him more time to take the bigger swings he employs. He has the power to rip through Nadal and moves brilliantly, especially on clay.  Dominic Thiem is one of only three players to have beaten Nadal three times on clay.Yet the world No. 8 needs to progress smoothly in the first week to have any chance of ousting Nadal.  And note that about three weeks after Thiem conquered Nadal last year in Rome, Nadal crushed his younger rival in the French Open semifinals. Fabio FogniniFabio Fognini has beaten Nadal twice on clay.The Italian is undeniably one of the enfants terrible of tennis. Among his indiscretions, Fognini was thrown out of the doubles event at the US Open last year after insulting a female chair umpire in his singles loss. More of that behavior and the tennis authorities could ban him from competing at two majors. But when keeping his concentration, Fognini is one of the top players in the world on clay, possessing a vast repertoire. His lone grand slam quarterfinal came in Paris in 2011, though he handed a walkover to Djokovic. The world No. 19 hasn't beaten Nadal three times on clay -- but has done it twice in Rio and Barcelona in 2015. Fognini's victory in Rio was all the more impressive because he lost the first set -- and since 2014 only three players have upended Nadal on clay after conceding the opener. Fognini's outstanding court coverage was evidenced by his unbelievable pick-up on match point in Rio. The 30-year-old also knows what it feels like to beat Nadal at a grand slam. In 2015 at the US Open, he became the first man to overturn a two-set deficit against the Spaniard. In a further boost to his confidence, he also won the first set against Nadal in Rome last week with wife Flavia Pennetta -- the 2015 US Open women's champion -- looking on. A knee issue may have hindered him thereafter. Kei NishikoriUnlike Thiem, Djokovic and Fognini, Japan's Nishikori has never beaten Nadal on clay. Nothing to be ashamed of there. Yet he was on his way to doing so in the 2014 Madrid Open final -- and convincingly. While the faster conditions in the Spanish capital have never been to Nadal's particular liking, it is still clay and Nishikori led 6-2 4-2 in front of a stunned, partisan crowd. Unfortunately for the 2014 US Open finalist, he began to suffer from the effects of a back injury, lost the second set and retired at 0-3 in the third. Kei Nishikori lost to Nadal in the recent Monte Carlo final. Nadal's coach, his uncle Toni, admitted afterward: \"We don't deserve the victory, he deserves it. He played better than us the whole time. We didn't really come back. He was hurt.\"Nishikori, 28, also ran Nadal close in Barcelona in 2016 and defeated him for the bronze medal on a hard court at the Rio Olympics in 2016, but fatigue was likely a factor for the 16-time grand slam winner. Nishikori is a clutch performer, too, in deciding third or fifth sets, holding a 119-38 win-loss record. He is still returning from wrist surgery -- injuries have been an ever present for the Japanese -- but another tick in the box is that he made the final in Monte Carlo in April, although he lost  to Nadal 6-3 6-2. Alexander Zverev Alexander Zverev is bidding to reach a first grand slam quarterfinal at the French Open. Keen to find the next big thing in a post Big Four world, the ATP is putting a large chunk of its eggs in the basket of Zverev. Understandably so. He is only 21 but Zverev -- mentored by his fellow German Becker -- has already won three Masters shields, including in Madrid when he toppled his pal Thiem in the finale. After Federer and Nadal, it's Zverev who comes next in the Masters Series rankings. Zverev packs plenty of punch, as one would expect from someone 6 feet 6 inches tall. But he moves exceptionally well for his size. Zverev held a match point against Nadal in Indian Wells in 2016, stretched him to five sets at the Australian Open a year later and took a set off the King of Clay Sunday. If there wasn't a rain delay in the third set when he led by a break, he might have prevailed. Alexander Zverev. Sketch by Gianluca Costantini.But it would be a tall order indeed for Zverev to beat Nadal at the French Open. He'll start as the second seed and will therefore only encounter Nadal in the final.

One recipient was St. Joseph's in Hackney, east London. \"To see the faces of the patients when they received the flowers was just fantastic,\" hospice spokeswoman Claire Learner told CNN.St Joseph's has a long history of royal connections, having been visited by Queen Elizabeth II, Princess Diana and, most recently, Prince Edward, who toured the grounds in 2015, the hospice said.Read MoreThe ties to the royal family do not stop there. Pauline Clayton, an 89-year-old patient, once worked as an embroideress to Norman Hartnell, one of the Queen's dressmakers. \n\n\n\n\nShe revealed that aged just 19, she worked for almost 50 hours on the train of the Queen's own wedding dress, according to the UK's Press Association.  Clayton added that she thought the gesture to donate the flowers was \"lovely.\" For Father Peter-Michael Scott, the hospice's lead chaplain, the gesture signified something altogether more fundamental. \"It is about the energy of love. We are absolutely thrilled by the flowers and wish them (Harry and Meghan) all the best for the future,\" he also told PA.CNN's Sheena McKenzie contributed to this report.",

        "content": "London (CNN)The official inquiry into last year's catastrophic fire at Grenfell Tower in London that killed 72 people opened Monday with heart-rending tributes by bereaved families who lost their loved ones.After opening statements and 72 seconds of silence to remember each victim, Marcio Gomes was the first to give a statement, telling of the devastation of losing his unborn son hours after he and his family escaped the inferno. His pregnant wife, Andreia Gomes, was put in an induced coma after the couple and their two young daughters ran from the 21st floor from the building at four in the morning. She gave birth hours later to a stillborn baby, whom they named Logan. \"That evening, I was fortunate enough to hold my son,\" Gomes said breaking down in tears, as he showed pictures of a baby scan, Logan's nursery being prepared and his wife happily pregnant.  \"(I was) hoping it was all a bad dream, wishing, praying, for any kind of miracle, that he would just open his eyes.\"Read MoreMarcio Gomes paying tribute to his unborn son, Logan, in London on Monday. \"He might not be here physically, but he'll always be here in our hearts,\" Gomes said. \"You don't know what you are made of until you are broken.\"  Gomes shared a picture of a scan showing his unborn baby. 'My dad loved life'The June 14 fire trapped many residents inside in the early morning as they slept, in what became the deadliest fire in the United Kingdom since 1988.Nearly a year on, families have the opportunity to commemorate those they lost and reflect on their lives.Lawyers read statements from family members of victim Mohamed Amied Neda, known as Saber, describing a hard-working father and husband who worked as a chauffeur and never took a sick day. Neda and his family fled persecution in Afghanistan and started a new life in the UK. Critics are angry because the Grenfell Tower review doesn't call for cladding ban\"In the 18 years that we lived in Grenfell, there was never a bad word said about him. My dad came to the UK on 1998 with my mum and me. I was only about 5 years old, but I can remember from the moment that he set foot in the UK, that he found himself a job and he worked hard until the day he passed away,\" his son, Farhad Neda said, according to the statement. \"We are a very close and happy family. I grew up in a safe home full of love and full of laughter. My dad loved life, and loved meeting people.\"Family members of four other victims -- Denis Murphy, Joseph Daniels, Mary Mendy and her daughter, Khadija Saye -- also shared their memories of their relatives Monday. Saye was 24 when she was killed in the fire. She was a budding photographer who had self-portraits recently exhibited at the renowned Venice Biennale.Saye's family showed excerpts of a documentary on her burgeoning career, portraying an energetic and passionate artist who was excited to be developing her career.A self-portrait by Khadija Saye on display at Tate Britain.The inquiry opened at the Millennium Gloucester Hotel in Kensington, London and is chaired by Sir Martin Moore-Bick, a retired judge. \"They will be remembered through the words and pictures chosen by the people who knew them best and loved them most,\" Moore-Bick said. This stage of the inquiry is expected to run for nine days, but the full inquiry's closing statement is scheduled for October 29 and could go longer than expected. Moore-Bick said that the tributes would not only serve a commemorative purpose. \"They are an integral part of the evidence before the inquiry, they will remind us of its fundamental purpose and the reason why it's so important that the truth be laid bare.\"The inquiry is tasked with establishing what happened and making recommendations to prevent a similar fire from causing such devastation again. Much of the focus of investigations since the fire has been on the material used in the building's cladding,  Grenfell tower sits in the affluent London borough of Kensington and Chelsea, but many of its residents were low-income earners living in social housing apartments.",

        "content": "(CNN)Police in Ireland have found a woman's body during a search for a Filipino student who was reportedly abducted close to her home on Saturday. The case has dominated headlines in the country after a frantic search was launched for the 24-year-old over the weekend. Irish police started searching for Jastine Valdez, who had relocated to Ireland three years ago, after a woman matching her description was seen being bundled into a car on Saturday evening.Ireland's national police -- the Garda\u00ed -- confirmed to CNN that the body of a woman had been located but that it had not yet been formally been identified. In the same statement, police also asked for privacy for the woman's family. Valdez was last seen leaving her home in Enniskerry, a sleepy, picturesque tourist village close to the Wicklow Mountains on Saturday afternoon to go to work in the nearby seaside town of Bray, according to local media reports.That evening, an eyewitness reported seeing a female pedestrian matching Valdez's description being bundled into a vehicle shortly after 6:15 p.m. while walking towards her home from a bus stop on a quiet, tree-lined road outside the village. Read MoreLater that night, Valdez's family reported her as missing to authorities.Search teams were called to the area, including a police helicopter and members of the Defence Forces and Civil Defence, Ireland's national broadcaster RT\u00c9 reported. On Sunday, after releasing a car registration plate to the public in connection with the abduction, a matching vehicle was spotted close to Enniskerry in a business park south of Dublin by member of the public. Shortly after, the driver of the car, who produced a knife, was shot dead by police who were deployed to the scene. The shooting of a suspect by a police officer is a highly unusual occurrence in Ireland where Garda\u00ed do not routinely carry firearms.   On Monday, police told the media that they found the body of a woman about six miles away from the location of the reported abduction near a disused lead mine in Rathmichael, south Dublin. Her abduction has caused shock and distress within the Filipino community in Ireland, according to local media reports.",

        "content": "Windsor, England (CNN)The masses roared, as they always do on such occasions, and under a cloudless English sky in the historic town of Windsor, there was a new beginning.It was a royal wedding like no other; a gospel choir sang, Dr. Martin Luther King was quoted in a rousing address and a young couple was united in a marriage that will change a venerable institution forever.Greeted by cheering crowds, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex emerged from St. George's Chapel and kissed on the steps as the sun shone down.Newlyweds Prince Harry and Meghan usher in a new era for British royalty.The marriage of the sixth in line to the throne to Meghan Markle, a biracial American, saw the British monarchy transform into something more representative of its people than it has been before. On the cobbled streets of Windsor, among the snaking river of people who turned out to celebrate, there was a sense from many that the newest member of the royal family had reinvigorated \"The Firm.\"Read MoreTwo women watching a video screen cry as the bride enters the chapel.\"It's good there's diversity in the royal family, it means a lot,\" said Abha Trivedi, a Californian who had relocated to London two weeks ago and slept overnight on a chair for a prime spot of the royal procession.Daljit Sidhu, of South Asian heritage but from Langley near Windsor, echoed such sentiments.\"As Asians it's important,\" the 41-year-old said. \"I was born and bred here, but you were always different. Ten years ago you wouldn't have thought this would happen.\"Pageantry with majestyThe Duke of Sussex and the Duchess of Sussex were greeted by a ripple of applause.Much has been spoken and written about of the newest member of royal family shaking up the establishment. But for all that was different about this royal wedding there was still the pomp and circumstance of old royalty.It was an impeccably choreographed wedding. A marching band paraded through the streets, aristocrats arrived and departed in supersized hats. Overseeing the service was the Archbishop of Canterbury. No one does pageantry with the majesty of the British. It comes by virtue of hundreds of years of practice. An estimated 100,000 had descended on this picturesque town 20 miles west of London on a glorious spring day to witness a wedding that has charmed not only the inhabitants of the UK but millions around the world.From Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to Ghana, the United States, Switzerland and Australia, thousands were captivated by tradition and glamor.They lined the cobbled streets, snacked on sandwiches drank Pimm's and waited and waited -- and waited -- for a chance to say \"I was there.\"Some of those who headed to Windsor hailed a new age of diversity in the British royal family.There was joy, giddiness and much affection for the couple, now one of the world's most powerful and influential pairings. In this part of England, for Saturday at least, everyone was a royalist and romantic.Seventy-three-year-old Australian Carleen Quirk had been sleeping on the streets of Windsor for two nights to ensure she was in prime position to witness her eighth royal wedding.Why does the British monarchy seduce and enchant so many? \"Having a royal family as head of a country is stabilizing,\" explained Quirk. \"And Meghan is a breath of fresh air.\"For Histria Soler, from the Dominican Republic but in London visiting friends, it was an opportunity to experience something usually seen in Disney movies. \"It's not often that you see a prince get married,\" she said. \"She was just a normal girl.\" Love and BritishnessBritain's Prince Harry and his best man Prince William wore military dress uniforms.Prince Harry and William are also, of course, the sons of Princess Diana and much interest in them stems from memories of her, a woman loved by the people, but whose own fairytale wedding ended in divorce.Though living extraordinary unusual and privileged lives, it is the brothers' ability to appear as regular men which has helped the family overcome the tumultuous final decades of the last century.Images of the young princes walking solemnly behind their mother's coffin remain strongly etched in the memory, so there has always been much goodwill for the boys who have now found love and married women considered unthinkable as prospective royal brides only a generation ago.\"My mum was a big fan of Diana and we got raised on that. Harry has his mother-like ways with the public. He's a people's person,\" said Daljit Sidhu.For all the ostentation, for all the millions spent, this was a day for all generations and all people. Windsor was filled with the sound of ecstatic cheers and jubilation in a celebration of love and Britishness.Many wore Union flag facepaint or outfits to the celebrations.Along the treelined Long Walk in front of the Castle, where the majority of the wedding watchers congregated, families and friends gathered to eat, drink and party. Even at 9 a.m. an orderly line had formed for chicken and french fries from one of the many food trucks.  Some wore dresses inspired by the UK flag, others donned paper crowns on their heads and simply waved flags towards the azure sky. Polish-born Angelica Kasperska had brought a ladder and binoculars for the occasion, a wise move when necks had to be craned for a glimpse of the great and good. Children played football and chased balloons, while bellowing traders peddled Harry and Meghan scarves and flags to a crowd thirsty for commemorative paraphernalia.The sight of homeless men, some sleeping, some sitting on the streets, was a reminder of the problems still facing this society, as it was eight years ago when the public mood before Prince William's wedding was weighed down by recession, unemployment and austerity.Prince Harry has married in the age of Brexit and he and his new bride have offered respite from the division that that has created.Gasps of delightAhead of the ceremony, there was applause from the throng on the Long Walk as big screens broadcast the first glimpse of Prince Harry arriving with his brother and best man Prince William. Both wore the frock coat uniform of the Blues and Royals regiment, made specially on London's Savile Row. It was showtime. Every familiar face was greeted warmly, with as much affection reserved for the mother of the bride, Doria Ragland, as the future king, and father of the groom, Prince Charles. There were gasps from the crowd as the dress and train were revealed.Wedding watchers gasped on first sight of the bride's dress and there was an audible intake of breath when the train emerged. The crowd cooed as the cameras flicked to a nervous-looking Harry and clapped as Prince Charles took Meghan by the arm before presenting her to his son.There was the glitz associated with any great royal wedding; the bride arrived in a Rolls-Royce and departed in a gilded carriage. She wore a Givenchy dress and Cartier earrings. But it was the zeal of the Most Rev. Michael Curry's stirring address which ensured that those watching were left in no doubt that this was now not the British monarchy as they knew it only yesterday. It felt different. It was different. Bishop Michael Curry: \"Two young people fell in love, and we all showed up.\"The African-American bishop began and ended with a quote from Dr. Martin Luther King, he talked of discovering the \"redemptive power of love,\" he compared the power of love to the power of fire, mentioned Instagram and caused a chuckle when he promised to wrap up his lengthy oration so \"we can get you two married.\"There was a sense that the crowd on the Long Walk did not know what to make of the groundbreaking moment, but they reserved some of their loudest cheers for Curry upon the conclusion of his sermon. 'This is history'Crowds line the route to catch a glimpse of the couple.\"Thank God the world is watching this,\" tweeted black British TV presenter Ore Oduba. \"Never seen or heard a ceremony like it. This is history.\"As the gospel choir sang \"Stand By Me\" the hordes lining the Long Walk sang along to the chorus of the 1961 classic. It was another unexpected moment. British royal weddings are usually packed full of hymns. Never before have they been a multicultural celebration. Sleep-deprived and jaded, the crowd's energy understandably abated until returning to full voice and renewed vigor when Prince Harry walked out of the chapel arm-in-arm with Meghan and embarked on a procession through Windsor's streets and park. The sound of clapping rippled through the town as a captivated public was given its opportunity to see husband and wife in the flesh. \"That was so cool,\" said a young American as the couple passed in a horse-drawn Ascot Landau carriage, flanked by the household cavalry soldiers, Prince Harry's former regiment. The new Duchess perhaps needs to practice her royal wave. It must be from the wrist, always from the wrist. But scorn cannot be poured on an occasion such as this. As the Most Rev. Curry said in his sermon: \"Two young people fell in love, and we all showed up.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)For Harry and Meghan, it was the morning after the night before. For the rest of Britain, it was a day to reflect on an electrifying wedding that's being hailed as a transformative moment for the British monarchy. After a ceremony that shook up royal tradition, a biography of the new Duchess of Sussex has appeared on the website of the British royal family, and it firmly emphasizes her activist credentials. High on the page, in a bold font, is a quote from a speech the then Meghan Markle delivered on International Women's Day in 2015:  \"I am proud to be a woman and a feminist.\"It is a quote that says much about the newest member of the royal family, whose decision to walk unaccompanied partway down the aisle of St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle set the tone for an unconventional royal wedding.

Hide Caption 5 of 9 Photos: Here, a glimpse of the jewelery -- earrings and bracelet made by Cartier.Hide Caption 6 of 9 Photos: The veil is held in place by Queen Mary's diamond bandeau tiara, on loan from the Queen. Crafted in 1932, the diamond bandeau features a center brooch dating from 1893.Hide Caption 7 of 9 Photos: Clare Waight Keller is the first female artistic director of the French fashion house, and a fitting choice for Meghan, who identifies as a feminist.Hide Caption 8 of 9 Photos: At her previous post as creative director of fashion house Chlo\u00e9, Waight Keller championed a free-spirited, feminine aesthetic that prioritized soft colors. At Givenchy, she's taken a darker, more cinematic turn -- a nod to Tisci's particularly Gothic legacy.Hide Caption 9 of 9The last public glimpse of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex was on Saturday evening when they  swept out of Windsor Castle in a vintage Jaguar convertible and drove south to Frogmore House, where Harry's father, Prince Charles, hosted an evening reception for 200 of the couple's friends and family.Fireworks lit up the sky as guests, including the tennis star Serena Williams and the Bollywood actress Priyanka Chopra, celebrated alongside members of the Royal Family.Read MoreFor the evening reception, Meghan changed into a bespoke, lily-white Stella McCartney high-necked dress.
