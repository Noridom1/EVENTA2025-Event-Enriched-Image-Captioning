        "content": "(CNN)Thousands of activists are set to march across nine cities in Australia on Friday, singling out Prime Minister Scott Morrison for climate inaction amid a worsening fire crisis that has ravaged large swathes of the country.The protests, organized by national student organization Uni Students for Climate Justice, will take place in cities including Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Perth. Huge crowds are expected, with tens of thousands marking themselves as attending on Facebook -- indicating widespread public discontent after months of increasingly deadly fires.Morrison has faced heavy criticism for his climate policies and response to the fires. Several of Friday's protests are under the slogan \"Sack Scomo.\"A total of 27 people have died this fire season, and the blazes are nowhere near done -- Australia is only about halfway through its hot, dry summer. State and federal authorities have been scrambling to respond, with thousands of firefighters on the ground and billions of dollars allocated in federal aid. But climate activists say it's not enough.Australia's deadly wildfires are showing no signs of stopping. Here's what you need to know\"We're protesting this Friday because we're outraged about our government's criminal negligence about the bushfire crisis, exacerbated by climate change,\" said the group on its Facebook page. \"We are protesting to give a voice to the tens of thousands of people who want real action on climate change and real funding for relief services.\"Read MoreFriday's protests will also push for five main demands: funding for firefighters, relief and aid for affected communities, land and water sovereignty for indigenous communities, an immediate transition toward renewable energy, and a \"just transition\" for workers in the fossil fuel industry.A climate protest in Sydney, Australia, on December 19, 2019.The biggest protest will likely be in Melbourne, where organizers are pushing forward despite authorities urging them to postpone due to dangerous fire conditions and limited resources.\"This week is not a time for public protest,\" said Victoria Police acting assistant commissioner Tim Hansen on Wednesday, adding that the force had formally asked organizers to move the protest time and date.He said the police force was already stretched thin and fatigued, and the protests would be a \"distraction\" and a \"resource drain\" on a day forecast to be hot and dangerous.Officers in Victoria are working on evacuations and preparations ahead of Friday, when temperatures are expected to spike -- but \"now on top of this, we are distracted by having to provide extra resources to support a protest activity,\" Hansen said.The organizers pushed back, posting on Facebook that the police were \"trying to paint ordinary people -- who are fed up with their lies, theft and criminal negligence -- as being a drain on emergency services.\"Public anger builds against MorrisonMorrison has faced growing anger and frustration from the public this month as the fires continue to spiral out of control. During a visit last week to the fire-ravaged town of Cobargo, in New South Wales state, Morrison was heckled by furious residents who had lost their homes.One woman said she would only shake his hand if he gave more funding to the NSW Rural Fire Service. \"We need more help,\" she shouted after him as he walked away.Another group was more explicit, cursing at him and saying, \"You're an idiot.\"JUST WATCHEDResidents vent fury at Australian PM amid wildfiresReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHResidents vent fury at Australian PM amid wildfires 02:03Morrison has been accused of not doing enough to address climate change, which experts say is making natural disasters like fires go from bad to worse. Summers in Australia are always hot and dry -- but fire seasons have been arriving earlier and spreading with greater intensity.\"The science is telling us ... these extreme heat conditions we've seen this year might occur naturally once every 350 years,\" said climate scientist and former federal climate commissioner Tim Flannery. \"But once you add in the influence of the human-emitted greenhouse gases, we're likely to see those conditions once every eight years.\"Flannery added that coal was \"a national addiction,\" and the link between government and the fossil fuel industry was \"almost complete.\"Woman dumps remains of her bushfire-ravaged home outside Australian parliament to protest climate change Critics of the Morrison administration have pointed to his history of climate skepticism and support for coal mines. In 2017, Morrison -- then treasurer -- made his position clear when he brought a lump of coal into Parliament.\"This is coal. Don't be afraid, don't be scared,\" he said, to jeers from the opposition. \"It's coal that has ensured for over 100 years that Australia has enjoyed an energy-competitive advantage that has delivered prosperity to Australian businesses.\"Since then, his climate rhetoric has softened a little -- he has acknowledged the link between climate change and extreme weather, and asserted his commitment to reduce emissions. But he also said that the government would only pursue \"sensible\" policies, and that there wasn't \"a single policy, whether it be climate or otherwise,\" that can fully protect Australia against the fires.What the climate crisis means for AustraliaThe fires have been exceptionally bad this year because of severe weather -- extreme heat, dry conditions and ferocious winds that whip up the flames and spread embers far distances, which then start new blazes.But the climate crisis in Australia goes far beyond the fires -- it has manifested in various forms, including the worst drought in living memory. The ongoing years-long drought has devastated farmers, whose very livelihoods are disappearing; images from the ground show cracked, barren land and skeletal cattle.It's official: 2019 was the second-hottest year on recordHeatwaves are also becoming more frequent and severe; one in December broke the record for highest nationwide average temperature, with some places measuring temperatures well above 40 degrees Celsius (about 113-120 degrees Fahrenheit). In 2018, one heatwave was so bad that flying foxes died by the thousands, falling out of their colonies in the trees.Meanwhile, the UNESCO heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef, a 1,500-mile stretch that supports thousands of species, is slowly dying from heating oceans. It lost more than half its coral in two mass bleaching events in 2016 and 2017, and is losing its ability to recover and replenish.Millions of animals are dying from the Australian fires, and the environment will suffer for years to comeThese events have taken a huge toll on wildlife -- Australia has the highest rate of species loss of any area in the world. Animals in the country have dealt with natural catastrophes like fires for millennia, but human interference and climate change have changed everything.\"(The animals are) not coping, and now they've got no grass, no water, no habitat,\" said Janine Green, a volunteer at WIRES Wildlife Rescue. \"Who knows if they can breed after this? We've never seen anything like this before.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)In a grim video posted on Twitter, a man drives into the fire-ravaged town of Batlow, in the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW). Both sides of the road are covered with ash and lingering smoke. They're also littered with the charred remains of animals killed in wildfires that have ripped through the region.The blazes, which have been burning across Australia for months, have razed homes and wiped out entire towns. Across Australia, nearly 18 million acres of land have been burned -- much of it bushland, forests and national parks, home to the country's beloved and unique wildlife. Volunteers around the world are sewing pouches for Australia's orphaned or injured kangaroos, koalas and batsNearly half a billion animals have been impacted by the fires in NSW alone, with millions potentially dead, according to ecologists at the University of Sydney. That figure includes birds, reptiles, and mammals, except bats. It also excludes insects and frogs -- meaning the true number is likely much higher. The total number of animals affected nationwide could be as high as a billion, according to Christopher Dickman, the University of Sydney ecologist who led the report.Fires are nothing new in Australia, but they have been growing more intense and becoming more destructive in recent years, a problem that has been exacerbated by climate change. And animals have been on the front lines -- Australia has the highest rate of species loss of any area in the world, and researchers fear that rate could increase as the fire disaster continues.Read More\"The scale of these fires is unprecedented,\" said Dieter Hochuli, an environmental sciences professor at the University of Sydney. \"There are substantial concerns about the capacity of these (ecosystems) to rebound from the fires.\"Flames, food, and predatorsThe team at the University of Sydney came to their conclusion by using estimates of NSW mammal population density in 2007 in order to estimate how many animals have been affected by the 4.9 million hectares (12.1 million acres) that have been set alight in the state this fire season.It's a pretty good estimate, Hochuli said -- but until the fires stop, they have no way of surveying exactly how many animals have died. And since the density figures excluded some species of bats and frogs, \"the true loss of animal life is likely to be much higher than 480 million,\" said a statement from the university.      Some animals, like koalas and kangaroos, are primarily killed directly by the fires -- for instance, by being incinerated in flames or choking on smoke. Nearly a third of all koalas in NSW have died and about a third of their habitat has been destroyed, federal environment minister Sussan Ley said in December.Photos from the ground show koalas with singed fur, raw patches of burnt flesh, and blistered paws. Even if they are rescued and treated, sometimes their injuries are simply too extensive to survive.Wombats have also been hit hard -- they don't cope well with heat or stress, and panic at the smell of smoke. The small, stubby-legged marsupials can't run very fast or far, and are largely at the mercy of the flames.A kangaroo in a smoky field on the outskirts of Cooma, New South Wales on January 4, 2020. \"It's just horrendous,\" said Graeme Jackson, a NSW resident who has experience raising orphaned wombats. \"A wombat can run 30 kilometers (per hour/18.6 mph), he can run that fast (for) short distances -- and then he burns.\"Other species don't die from the flames or smoke, but instead from the fire's aftermath. Smaller mammals and reptiles can escape the blazes by burrowing underground or hiding in rocks -- but afterward, there is no food or shelter left, only certain predators that are drawn to fire because they know it brings easy prey.\"The big issue is that feral cats and red foxes hone in on fire front -- they come in and pick off animals, it's an open hunting area,\" said Dickman, from the University of Sydney.A koala recovering from burns at The Port Macquarie Koala Hospital on November 29, 2019.Koalas and kangaroos are spread out across the country, so they're not in danger of going extinct due to the blazes. But other animals that live in niche environments and have smaller populations may have been wiped out entirely; these include the eastern bristlebird, the mountain pygmy possum and the corroboree frog. For these species, \"if its habitat burns, it's a goner,\" Dickman said.Extinction doesn't happen all at once. Each species on Earth has an average of 220 populations, so a healthy species could recover if only a handful of populations die out. But \"if you whittle away population after population, then eventually you'll be left with half a dozen, then three, two, then maybe even one population,\" Dickman said. \"Then all it takes is one event and it's gone -- a fire, drought, whatever.\"JUST WATCHEDWatch this thirsty koala guzzle a cyclist's water bottleReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWatch this thirsty koala guzzle a cyclist's water bottle 01:07Climate crisis and recovery in a changing landscapeThese animals' recovery depends not only on their population size, but also on the condition of their habitat. For instance, plants grow slower in high-altitude alpine regions, meaning it could be a very long time before species are able to return.Sometimes, even if a habitat heals, the animals don't come back. In 1993, a fire in NSW's Royal National Park wiped out the greater gliders -- a type of lemur-like gliding marsupial -- that lived there. \"The population is effectively gone,\" Dickman said.The Irwin family is working to save the animals injured in the Australia wildfires It's not that animals are unprepared for natural disasters -- they've been dealing with fires for millennia. But human interference has changed everything. We have fragmented natural environments with cities and residential areas, cleared land for our use, and introduced invasive species -- making it harder for native species to recolonize after fires.Perhaps the most devastating human factor has been the climate crisis, which experts say has made natural disasters go from bad to worse. Australia is experiencing one of its most severe droughts in decades, and a heatwave in December broke the record for highest nationwide average temperature, with some places sweltering under temperatures well above 40 degrees Celsius (about 113-120 degrees Fahrenheit). JUST WATCHEDScientist: 'I'm certain' climate change caused Australia firesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHScientist: 'I'm certain' climate change caused Australia fires 12:11It's gotten so bad that the heat and drought were killing thousands of flying foxes even before the fires began. \"They've been falling out of trees in large numbers,\" Dickman said. Their population is \"almost certain\" to have depleted further now that fires have burned their habitat.The depletion of animals and their homes is a vicious cycle; just as animals need habitats to survive, so too do habitats need their animals. For instance, a type of rat kangaroo called the potoroo is crucial to keeping forest soil healthy. If potoroos are hit by fire, some plant species might be unable to regenerate, which could then kill off other species that feed on vegetation. Ecosystems are built on balance -- once one element is thrown off, everything is affected.A potoroo, a small marsupial that belongs to the kangaroo family.Animal hospitals, zoos and rescue groups on the ground are doing their best to respond to the fire crisis, with local residents and volunteers pitching in to care for injured animals.\"This is huge because we had a drought before we had this bushfire, so the animals are already undernourished,\" said Janine Green, a volunteer at WIRES Wildlife Rescue, who rescued a possum with badly burnt paws on Tuesday near the NSW town of Cobargo. Australia's deadly wildfires are showing no signs of stopping. Here's what you need to knowFederal Environment Minister Ley said in December that the government is working with koala experts, and had allocated $6 million Australian dollars ($4.1 million) to establish habitat corridors and a plan for releasing animals that have been in hospitals.But some fear that unless authorities take decisive long-term action on climate change and animal conservation, the country's wildlife and environment could face a dire future. Australia has more than 300 native species -- and about 81% of them are only found in the country. If they are wiped out here, these rare animals could be gone for good.\"They're not coping, and now they've got no grass, no water, no habitat,\" Green said. \"Who knows if they can breed after this? We've never seen anything like this before.\"",

When the Games open, she will be 12 years 12 days old, which will make her a year and two days younger than record holder Margery Hinton, who competed as a swimmer for Great Britain in 1982.While there are plenty of young men and women making moves in the skateboarding world, Brown leads the pack as a phenom.

In 2019, he won individual gold in both the pommel horse and parallel bars as well as helping Japan win gold in the men's team event at the Junior World Artistic Gymnastics Championships.The year before he did even better, winning five gold medals at the 2018 Youth Olympics, becoming the first gymnast ever to do so in the process.Takeru Kitazono prepares for the parallel bars event at the 2018 Youth Olympics.Caroline Dubois, BoxingThere is a buzz in boxing that Caroline Dubois is not just the next Nicola Adams, but is potentially the best female boxer ever. The Londoner was recently named 2019 BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year, and has already won gold at the 2018 Youth Olympic Games and 2019 EUBC Youth European Boxing Championships.She may only be 18-years old, but she is expected to compete for medals in Tokyo this summer.Caroline Dubois celebrates winning gold at the 2018 Youth Olympics.Eduardo Camavinga, SoccerEduardo Camavinga has not yet broken into the French national team, but that doesn't mean he isn't one of the most exciting young soccer players in Europe.At just 17, Camavinga has already set the French Ligue 1 alight with his tidy footwork and quick passing for Rennes. He is already dictating the team's play despite making his senior debut for the club less than a year ago.Eduardo Camavinga greets fans after Rennes' French Cup victory over Amiens.Lin Shan, DivingChina's dominance of women's Olympic diving is unprecedented, winning 24 of the 28 medals available since the 1984 Games in Los Angeles.Now, the 18-year-old Lin Shan is the next star off China's diver production line.Following her victory at the 2019 World Aquatics Championships in the mixed team event, she will be expected to deliver in Tokyo.Lin Shan won gold in the 10m platform at the 2018 Youth Olympics.Sandra Lettner, Sport ClimbingLike skateboarding, sport climbing will make its Olympic debut in Tokyo. And one of the bright young lights of the sport is 18-year old Sandra Lettner. The Austrian won gold at the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics, placing highly in all disciplines including first place in the Lead event. While Lettner may not pick up a medal this summer in Tokyo, she will no doubt have an impact on the competition.Sandra Lettner is one of sport climbing's brightest young stars.Dimitri Coutya, Wheelchair FencingThis summer will be Coutya's second Paralympic Games. In Rio, he reached the quarterfinals of both the category B foil and ep\u00e9e events for Great Britain, a disappointing return for someone who had won a silver in the category B foil at the previous year's IWAS Wheelchair Fencing World Championships. But since then, the 22-year old has gone from strength to strength. At 2017's World Championships, Coutya won gold in both disciplines. At the 2019 competition, he won gold in ep\u00e9e, and placed second in foil. Despite his relative youth compared with many of his rivals, Coutya is the favorite going into Tokyo.Dimitri Coutya won his first IWAS Wheelchair Fencing World Championships gold at the age of just 20.Krist\u00f3f Mil\u00e1k, SwimmingAnyone who can knock Michael Phelps off his perch is someone to watch. And that's exactly what 19-year old Mil\u00e1k did last year. Phelps' 200-meter butterfly world record stood for 10 years, but at the 2019 World Aquatics Championships the Hungarian eclipsed the American Olympic great and broke his record by 0.78 seconds on his way to winning gold. Keep an eye out for him smashing more records this summer in Tokyo.Krist\u00f3f Mil\u00e1k is only 19 but he's already broken Michael Phelps' 200m butterfly world record.Ja Morant, BasketballGoing into the 2019 NBA Draft, all eyes were on Zion Williamson, who was tipped by everyone to be selected first overall by the New Orleans Pelicans. Indeed he was, but it is the second overall pick by the Memphis Grizzlies, Ja Morant, who is favorite to win NBA Rookie of the Year this season.The 20-year old point guard leads all rookies in points per game and assists per game, and is predicted by some to be voted onto the NBA All-Stars team.Ja Morant has been one of the most impressive rookies in the NBA this season.Aaliyah Powell, TaekwondoAaliyah Powell (right) dodges a kick from Morocco's Oumaima El Bouchti on her way to winning bantamweight gold at the 2019 World Taekwondo Championships.In 2019 at the age of just 16, Powell became Great Britain's youngest ever senior World Taekwondo Championships medalist. She said her aim was just to win her first match, but she came away with bantamweight bronze.GB taekwondo great and double Olympic champion Jade Jones' first medal came when she was 18, but Powell has now eclipsed that record.She will be another young star to watch in Tokyo this summer.",

        "images": [],
        "content": "London (CNN)The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's surprise announcement that they plan to step back from royal duties and \"transition into a new working model\" has raised many questions -- not least, how they plan to support themselves. In their statement, Prince Harry and Meghan said they would \"work to become financially independent,\" and published a detailed document outlining the structure and funding of their household.Harry and Meghan's shock announcement dominates UK mediaAccording to the statement, the couple receive 5 percent  of their income from the Sovereign Grant -- a lump sum of UK taxpayers' money given to the Queen every year -- and 95 percent from the Duchy of Cornwall, the private estate controlled by Prince Charles, Harry's father. The couple said they intended to give up the money received from the Sovereign Grant. That move, they argued, will enable them to continue \"charitable endeavours as well as establishing new ones,\" while also allowing them to earn a professional income -- which they are at present forbidden from doing. The website declares: \"Their Royal Highnesses feel this new approach will enable them to continue to carry out their duties for Her Majesty The Queen, while having the future financial autonomy to work externally.\"Read MoreWhat is the Sovereign Grant? The Sovereign Grant is an annual sum of money given to the Queen by the UK government to meet the central staff costs and running expenses of Her Majesty's official household. It also covers maintenance of the royal palaces and the cost of travel to carry out royal engagements. In exchange for this public support, the Queen surrenders the revenue from the Crown Estate, a collection of UK properties and farms that generate hundreds of millions of pounds a year, to the government. The Sovereign Grant is calculated on a formula based on the size of that revenue. In the 2018-19 financial year, it was \u00a349.3 million ($64.3 million). The royal accounts do not say exactly how much is transferred to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, although they do state that the couple received about \u00a3100,000 in travel costs. New year, new royal portrait released The Sussexes say the grant covers just 5% of their costs and is specifically used for their official office expense. They did not say how much they receive from the Sovereign Grant -- but royal accounts show that they received just under $104,000 in the 2018/19 financial year for travel expenses. Other costs are not broken down in the accounts, so it is not possible to say how much they receive in taxpayers' funding.In the statement, the couple said that they \"prefer to release this financial tie.\" The duke and duchess said the new approach will allow them to \"continue to carry out their duties\" for the Queen, while having \"the future financial autonomy to work externally.\"Under the current structure and financing arrangements the couple are not allowed to earn any income in any form.The couple plan to continue using Frogmore Cottage as their royal residence when in BritainThe couple attracted criticism about the \u00a32.4 million (about $3 million) of public money spent on renovations to Frogmore Cottage, a large house on the Queen's Windsor estate, where they live with the monarch's permission. While the refurbishment was funded by the Sovereign Grant, the fixtures, fittings and furnishings were privately funded by duke and duchess. \"Public funding has never been used, nor would it ever be used for private expenditure by The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who also do not receive any tax privileges,\" the couple said. That statement, however, omits to point out that the Duchy of Cornwall -- the source of most of their income -- itself receives significant tax exemptions because of the way it is set up.It's been a year of scandal and missteps for Britain's royals. Now the 93-year-old Queen is needed more than everThe duchy was established by King Edward III in 1337 in a charter that ruled that each future Duke of Cornwall would be the monarch's eldest surviving son and heir to the UK throne, currently Prince Charles.Today it funds the public, charitable and private activities of Prince Charles and his family -- including the Sussexes. It is exempt from UK business tax because it is not established as a corporation in UK law, and is also exempt from capital gains tax, according to the duchy's website.How might they fund their lifestyle? The couple are unlikely to struggle when it comes to their private income -- whether it might be through sponsorship, speaking tours or the like. Media reports have suggested that Meghan was independently worth around $5 million prior to marrying Harry.She rose to fame as Rachel Zane in the US legal drama Suits, but her popularity also grew through her hugely popular Instagram account and her successful lifestyle blog -- The Tig -- both of which have since been closed.In her first interview alongside Prince Harry in November 2017, Meghan said she intended to quit acting after their marriage, calling the change a \"new chapter.\" Meghan and Harry spent \u00a32.4m of taxpayers' money on new homeBut royal biographer Penny Junor told CNN that the pair will need a \"considerable income to support their current lifestyle.\" She added that if they plan to support the Queen and other charitable patronages, \"they won't have much time for other work.\"Junor said: \"I suppose Meghan could go back to acting and Harry could fly helicopters, but to be honest I don't think they have thought this thing through.\"Inside the Royal familyCNN's new Original Series goes inside the story of the world's most famous Royal family. \"The Windsors: Inside the Royal Dynasty\" premieres Sunday, February 16 at 10 p.m. ET/PT. Follow along with #TheWindsorsCNN. Besides his income from the Duchy of Cornwall, Harry inherited several million from the Queen Mother, and a few million more was left to him in trust by his late mother, Princess Diana. His personal wealth is estimated to be around $40 million. The cost of personal travel, which has landed the pair in hot water in recent months, is privately funded and will continue to be so, the couple said. Any official visits that they may do in future will continue to be funded by the Sovereign Grant, plus contributions from the host country, the statement added.The cost of security will continue to be the responsibility of the British government as the couple are \"classified as internationally protected people which mandates this level of security.\" No breakdown of the costs has been revealed, with the UK government citing security reasons.",

        "content": "(CNN)2020 brought us Brexit. And now, the exit of the royal family's two biggest stars (aside from the Queen, obviously).  Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, announced late Wednesday that they would be stepping back from their roles as senior members of the British royal family and begin working towards financial independence.The news, which the couple broke in a post on Instagram, came as a surprise to both the royal family itself -- they did not consult any other royals about their decision -- and the wider public, who swiftly began speculating about what was next for the pair.From whether Meghan might star in a future season of popular Netflix series \"The Crown,\" to how Harry might get a job without a proper last name, CNN's Max Foster has answered all your most burning questions. Read MoreWhy now?The decision comes upon the couple's return from a six-week family break in Canada and UK. But this is something has been building for years since Harry's childhood; brought up under the glare of publicity, the young prince saw his mother, Princess Diana, suffer at the hands of the paparazzi. Harry said previously he didn't think he'd be able to meet someone who could put up with the pressure, and, ultimately, Meghan has found it unbearable. The birth of their son, Archie, last spring, gave new impetus to their departure from the spotlight. In fact, Archie's naming hinted at the move -- they decided not to give him an official title, presumably to allow him a right to a private life. Will they lose their titles?Prince Harry and Meghan suggest on their new Sussex Royal website that they will be able to keep their titles, citing historic precedent. Other members of the royal family -- like Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie -- hold titles and also have jobs. What's their last name?That's a gray area for senior royals, but we can assume they will take Mountbatten-Windsor, as that's what they gave Archie as his surname. Would the Queen have had to sign this off?Moves as significant as this typically require approval from Queen Elizabeth, the head of family and state. But the couple did not consult the Queen ahead of the decision. When you consider the royal family is essentially a firm, it seems unprecedented that they would not have spoken to \"the boss\" -- especially as they are effectively demanding new roles, not walking out. There is said to be a mood of deep disappointment in the palace following the announcement; senior members of the family are hurt as a result of the news. Why wouldn't Harry and Meghan consult the royal family?Last year, an ITV documentary chronicling the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's royal tour in southern Africa confirmed what many had suspected for quite some time: a rift within the royal family. Asked about media speculation of an estrangement with his older brother, William, Harry said the pair were \"on different paths.\" Given those tensions, it may not be entirely surprising that the couple didn't consult the rest of the family. Do they pay taxes?The Duke and Duchess do not have any tax privileges. But, because they don't have private incomes at the moment and largely live off public and family expenses, they have not had to pay any tax. Does the change mean Meghan will play herself in The Crown?In her first ever interview alongside Prince Harry, Meghan said she intended to quit acting after their marriage, calling the change a \"new chapter.\" Unfortunately for Crown fans, that means she is not likely to grace Netflix anytime soon. Will Meghan go back to acting at all?Again, unlikely. Meghan has made clear that her priority is female empowerment and her charitable work. Will Harry get a job?Presumably that's the only option, if he wants financial independence. But it's unclear what he might do, beyond his charitable work. What does it mean to be financially independent? Weren't they already?Under the previous financing arrangements, Harry and Meghan were prohibited from earning any income in any form. Up until now, 5% of the couple's official expenses were paid for by the Sovereign Grant -- an annual lump sum from the UK government. But they say they are now giving up that public funding to become \"financially independent.\" The couple said they will continue to receive money from Harry's father, Prince Charles, who funds the remaining 95% of the couple's personal and professional expenses through his private estate, the Duchy of Cornwall. But will Charles continue to finance them at the same level, given how hurt the family was by the surprise announcement? Harry also inherited millions from Princess Diana, but it is probably not enough for the couple to live on with their current lifestyle. Didn't they just take a bunch of public money to do up Frogmore?Yes. They spent \u00a32.4 million (about $3 million) of British taxpayers' money on renovations to, Frogmore Cottage, their official residence on Windsor Estate, west of London, according to the Royal Household's latest annual financial statement. Works included the removal of a chimney, re-finishing the roof, new staircases, fireplace installations and a new \"floating\" wooden floor. Expenses related to fixtures, furnishings and fittings were funded privately by the couple. Where will they live now?The Duke and Duchess said on their website that they will continue to use Frogmore Cottage as their official residence so that \"their family will always have a place to call home in the United Kingdom.\" But that will require permission of the Queen. Her office says all the details will \"take time to work through.\" What happens to their foundation?That remains an open question. Does it mean anything for the line of succession? Does it mean anything for baby Archie?No. What is the 'royal rota' system?As part of the Sussex's new \"working model,\" they've re-envisioned their relationship with the press. That includes no longer participating in the \"royal rota\" -- a system that was set up to give UK media access to official engagements carried out by the royal family, which they then share between them. The couple has long had a rocky relationship with the press, and effectively torched parts of the UK media and some royal correspondents in a press release, saying that they had propelled misreporting and presented false impressions of their lives.",

The devastation can be clearly seen, with brown burn scars and active fires where lush greenery once stood.     NASA estimates that 155,000 hectares (600 square miles) of the island has been consumed by fires, calling it \"an ecological tragedy\".Lying off Australia's southern coast, Kangaroo Island is famous for its pristine wilderness. It contains protected nature reserves teeming with native wildlife, such as sea lions, koalas and diverse bird species. The island is home to the endangered Kangaroo Island dunnart -- a small marsupial found only on the island -- and the glossy black cockatoo, which have been brought back from the brink of extinction over the past two decades.Read MoreDevastating blazes have been ripping through the island since late December, killing two people, destroying 56 homes and damaging hundreds of buildings, according to the South Australia government.Southern Ocean Lodge, a  luxury hotel near Flinders Chase National Park in Kangaroo Island, was destroyed in the wildfires.\nThe NASA image showed that much of the burned areas were in the island's west, including the Flinders Chase National Park, where the fires were initially sparked by lightning strikes. The park is a popular place for spotting the duck-billed platypus, one of Australia's most beloved species.JUST WATCHEDFires threaten koalas in New South WalesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFires threaten koalas in New South Wales 02:22Ecologists estimate that about 25,000 koalas on Kangaroo Island have died in the fires, accounting for half of the island's population of the marsupials, according to NASA. The island was once considered a safe haven for koalas because the population there was free from chlamydia -- a disease that can cause blindness, infertility and death that is prevalent among koalas on the mainland.Australia's deadly wildfires are showing no signs of stopping. Here's what you need to knowThe blazes have been burning across Australia for months, razing homes and wiping out entire towns. Across the country, more than 7.3 million hectares (28,185 square miles) of land has burned -- much of it bushland, forests and national parks, home to the country's beloved and unique wildlife.According to report by ecologists at the University of Sydney, nearly half a billion animals in the state of New South Wales have been impacted by the fires, with millions potentially dead. The total number of animals affected nationwide could be as high as a billion, according to Christopher Dickman, the University of Sydney ecologist who led the report.CNN's Jessie Yeung contributed to this report.",

We love him.\"Mane was the most expensive African footballer of all-time when he was signed from Southampton for $43 million in 2016, and since then has gone on to become a fan favorite at Anfield where, staggeringly, he is yet to lose a Premier League fixture.\"We've seen over the years several players come to Liverpool with big reputations for big money and they haven't really cut the mustard week in, week out,\" says Roberts. \"Sometimes you wonder about their passion to win, you wonder about how much they want it. There's never been that question with Sadio Mane. It's written large in the way he plays football ... you'd feel he would run through a wall now to try and win a football match for Liverpool.\"Mane (right) controls the ball against Wolves last month.'Liverpool's best player for three seasons'Mane, who signed a long-term contract with the club in November 2018, has contributed 11 goals in 19 games so far this season.His fitness will be crucial as the Reds -- now 13 points clear at the top of the Premier League -- negotiate a crowded fixture calendar in a bid to win their first title in 30 years.Liverpool announces lucrative multi-year kit deal with Nike\"Sadio Mane's output has got basically better and better to the point where he's consistently been Liverpool's best player for three seasons now,\" Paul Machin, a Liverpool fan and presenter of the YouTube channel The Redmen TV, tells CNN Sport. As Mane's performances have improved, so too, it seems, has his love for the game.\"There's something about him and the way he plays football,\" Machin adds. \"I always talk about when Ronaldinho was at the peak of his powers at Barcelona and he played with a smile on his face. Mane looks like that. \"There's a lot of footballers out there and you get the impression that they're the best in the world but you don't get the impression that they love the game. I think there's something very contagious about Mane's joy of football.\"Mane (left) celebrates scoring against Sheffield United with teammate Roberto Firmino.That contagious joy was laid bare during Liverpool's FA Cup victory on Sunday.

        "content": "(CNN)Researchers have launched a new study which hopes to better understand the link between playing soccer and developing dementia. The project by the University of East Anglia (UEA) hopes to serially test former professionals, both male and female, every six months in order to map their rate of decline. By using cutting edge technology, the project aims to detect signs of dementia long before noticeable symptoms, such as memory loss.The new initiative follows a landmark study released by the University of Glasgow that revealed former players were around a three and a half times more likely to die from neurodegenerative disease. \"In former professionals, there is a problem. We now need to investigate that much further,\"  lead researcher of the UEA project Dr. Michael Grey told CNN Sport.Read More\"What we're interested in doing is looking at people who are actually still with us. I want to to follow them for years, ideally for the rest of their lives.\"Concussion in football: Temporary substitutions could be on the wayThe majority of participants will be able to take part in the tests from the comfort of their own homes, using their tablet or computer devices to complete simple tasks. The project will include a number of \"novel\" techniques including testing spatial navigation, an area of cognitive function that Dr. Grey says seems to degrade more rapidly than others.\"I think the easiest way to explain it is if you drove into work today, you could probably close your eyes and point to your car, and you'd be pretty close to being accurate,\" he said.\"People with dementia have challenges doing those types of exercises because it relies on an area of the brain that's responsible for remembering where we are in space.\"The UEA wants to raise \u00a31 million ($1.32m) for new study and hopes 10% of that figure will be crowd funded.READ: 'Hopefully no one has to die': Taylor Twellman's fears over head injuriesResearchers believe heading the ball could lead to long-term damage. 'It does make you think'Despite concussions being a dangerous consequence of the game, Dr. Grey says repetitive head trauma, such as heading the football, is a bigger issue in terms of degeneration.There are concerns that the entire action of competing in the air, including accidentally clashing heads or falling awkwardly, can contribute to the problem.Dr. Grey also says the theory of modern, lighter balls being less dangerous than the heavy balls of the past is a red herring, explaining the velocity of the ball has increased over time which could cause further damage. \"Each time we head the ball, there's a little bit of micro damage to the neurons in the brain and doing that over and over again in a professional career is what we think is resulting in degeneration,\" he said. International football's concussion protocols 'are the worst in the world'The project is now on the look-out for former professionals to take part, with former striker Iwan Roberts one of the first to register his interest.The Welshman, who represented clubs such as Leicester and Norwich City, played over 700 times in his 20-year career and heavily relied on his heading ability to score countless goals.The 51-year-old says he never thought about the possible dangers of his trade but is now keen to be involved in UEA's long-term project. \"It does make you think,\" Roberts, who retired in 2005, told CNN Sport. \"I'm not just talking about all the games that I played, I'm talking about repetitive heading on a daily basis to improve your heading ability, which as a big center forward I did every day at the end of a training session. \"I'd go with a coach and we'd have a left winger and the right winger and they just crossed balls for 45 minutes to an hour. I would just get into the habit of scoring goals with my head.\"Former professional Iwan Roberts wants to be involved in the new project. 'People are not willing to talk'Roberts, who has been filming a documentary about dementia and soccer for Welsh language channel S4C, says people within the game are now more aware of the dangers but still believes the sport's governing bodies can do more in supporting ex-professionals. \"It's something that people are not willing to talk about because certain authorities in this country [England] don't want to be blamed for certain things,\" he said. The English Football Association (FA) and the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) both helped fund the University of Glasgow field study which published its findings in October.The FA responded by reissuing its best practices for concussion protocols and for coaching heading, saying \"there is no evidence to show that heading can cause long-term damage.\"On its website, the PFA says neurological problems \"have been on our agenda for the last 20 years\" and have set up a dementia support document and helpline. Dr. Grey believes the sport is finally getting to grips with the potential problem and hopes such organizations will continue to develop its understanding of such issues. \"I think the fact that we're having this conversation is a good thing,\" he said.\"It's a cultural change that we need to effect. It will take some time, but we'll get them on board.\"Researchers are looking for former professional players aged over 50 to take part in the study, in addition to active non-footballers aged over 50.",

        "content": "(CNN)When a new year rolls in, the eyes of the sporting world usually turn to Australia, which hosts the first tennis major of the season. But this year raging bushfires have put the country in the spotlight, consequently raising questions about player and fan safety ahead of tennis' grand slam curtain-raiser. For months, fires have devastated homes and wildlife across Australia, killing 24 people. The air quality in the country has also worsened, with the capital of Canberra now amongst the most polluted in the world. So what does that mean for the Australian Open, which is scheduled to start on January 20? Melbourne, which hosts the tournament, is expected to see smoke blow over from fires in the southeastern states of Victoria and New South Wales during the tournament.  Read MoreVisit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featuresIn a series of Twitter posts Tuesday, Australian Open organizers indicated the tournament would likely go ahead as planned, even though defending men's champion Novak Djokovic said earlier this week that delaying the start of tournament had to be considered given the extreme nature of the fires. \"In the unlikely case of extreme smoke conditions, the roofs will be closed on the 3 stadium courts and play will continue in their air-conditioned, air-filtered environment,\" the official Australian Open Twitter account said. \"If smoke infiltrates the 3 stadium courts the air conditioning system will filter it out.\"Novak Djokovic hits a return against Gael Monfils during the ATP Cup in Brisbane.READ: Novak Djokovic matches Maria Sharapova's $17,400 donation to Australia's bushfire reliefThree of the Australian Open's show courts at Melbourne Park -- Rod Laver Arena, Margaret Court Arena and Melbourne Arena -- have retractable roofs that are closed in the case of rain or extreme heat, and the site also hosts the National Tennis Center, which has eight further indoor courts that are thought to be an option for the tournament if the air quality is too poor to play.Djokovic, who is the president of the ATP Player Council, had said: \"I know in China the playing conditions are very tough in terms of quality of air but this is something different -- I have never had this kind of experience before. \"(Delaying the tournament) is probably the very, very last option. If it comes down to ... the conditions affecting the health of players, you have to consider it.\"The calendar year's first grand slam is no stranger to severe weather. Temperatures often soar above 40 degrees Celsius (104F) over the course of the fortnight, and the same is expected this time around as the country nears its hottest point of the year. An extreme heat policy has been in place for a number of years, and last year a heat stress scale was introduced to help measure hot weather conditions more comprehensively. \"Assessing the likelihood of smoke-induced interruptions is a bit like how we treat heat and rain,\" head of Tennis Australia Craig Tiley is widely reported as saying this week.\"We have experts who analyse all available live data as specific to our sites as possible and consult regularly with tournament officials and, in the case of heat and smoke, medical experts.\"     As for the players, the resounding response to the bushfires has been a rallying cry for support. Nick Kyrgios kick-started fundraising efforts last week when he pledged $140 (200 AUSD) to relief efforts for each ace he hits at upcoming tournaments.

READ: Emotional Nick Kyrgios leads bushfire support as Tennis Australia pledges $700,000\"Tennis is a sport, it's a game that we play, and there are certainly a lot of bigger things going on in Australia right now that we need to take of,\" said Barty, who also donated $20,850 ($30,000 AUSD) to the RSPCA to support wildlife affected by the fires at the end of last year. \"It means that if we were delayed by a day or two (at the Australian Open) ... it really doesn't matter. What matters is that Australians stay safe and we kind of sort out the bigger issues.\"Ashleigh Barty will donate her winnings at the Brisbane International to Australia's bushfire relief.The Canberra International, which got underway on Monday, has been relocated 600 kilometers away from the capital to the city of Bendigo because of the air quality, and tennis isn't the only sport to be affected.Rugby union side the Brumbies have moved their training base from Canberra to Newcastle because of poor air conditions.A Big Bash League fixture in the capital was abandoned because of a smoke haze in December and golfers complained of coughing fits and burning eyes while competing at the Australian Open in Sydney, where New Zealander Ryan Chisnall borrowed a mask from a spectator to help his asthma. The Australian government has advised that individuals can protect themselves from bushfire smoke by staying indoors with windows and doors shut and avoiding physical activity.For the world's tennis elite, however, that may not be an option.CNN Weather's Brandon Miller contributed to this report",

        "content": "(CNN)Electric racing series Formula E is at the vanguard of promoting a greener sport and its new boss believes it will benefit the planet as a whole.Chief executive Jamie Reigle, who has replaced Formula E's founder Alejandro Agag, says the circuit espouses an environmental message and insists its carbon footprint is outweighed by the benefits.\"Climate crisis is very real,\" Reigle told Nicki Shields of CNN's Supercharged TV show. \"The goal was to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles because automobiles and transport contribute approximately 25 percent of carbon emissions globally. \"So Alejandro's (Agag) vision was, if we can get a car race seriously to showcase the potential of electric vehicles, we will accelerate the adoption and that will be very good for the planet in the medium term. \"Obviously, that comes with, when you have global ambition, some logistics that are involved when it comes to taking the circus around the world, so to speak. Our view is the carbon emissions that come from that will be dwarfed relative to the change in adoption of electric vehicles over time.\"Read MoreREAD: Lewis Hamilton defends environmental social media posts, aims to be 'carbon neutral'Reigle (right) with Alberto Longo (left) and Sebastien Buemi (center) ahead of the Diriyah E-Prix.Making stridesWhile F1's announcement of a new 10-year plan to become carbon neutral by 2030 is a positive step, Reigle thinks the environmental challenges the two forms of racing face differ greatly, meaning they must come up with different solutions to them. \"Motorsport exists partially around technology transfer into road cars. But it's also a form of entertainment. A release for fans,\" he said. Classic cars experiencing royal rebirths as electric vehicles \"Formula 1 has massive fanbase around world and I think they'll be well served by that. Our challenge then is to tell a different story around street racing and around the potential of electric vehicles. I think those two will coexist quite nicely for a long time.\"Comparisons are often drawn between the two racing championships due to the similarities in teams and the championship's format. But Reigle believes any comparison between the two is not helpful. \"I don't think it's super productive for us to reference ourselves against them,\" he said. \"I think we have a core proposition where we're about electric racing, and it's street racing and city centers. \"It's a fundamentally different product. And I don't think those are mutually exclusive. So it's not about whether we're going to catch up to them or surpass them. It's about is our product something that fans want to engage with? \"I think when you see the Porsches, the Mercedes, the Audi's, the big OEMs coming in, it shows the basic value in the technology development, but also in engaging with the younger consumer that will buy those electric cars in the future.\"READ: Formula E is not a threat, says Formula 1 boss Chase Carey Photos: The 2019/20 Formula E seasonMexico City, R4: Porsche's Andre Lotterer (right) led the field off the grid from pole in what was an incident filled Mexico E-Prix.Hide Caption 1 of 14 Photos: The 2019/20 Formula E seasonA huge crowd reported to number about 100,000 turned out to watch the electric racing series.Hide Caption 2 of 14 Photos: The 2019/20 Formula E seasonA helmeted fireman watches on as the race unfolds.Hide Caption 3 of 14 Photos: The 2019/20 Formula E seasonAustralia's Mitch Evans, driving a Panasonic Jaguar Racing car, overtook Lotterer on the first corner and built up a sizeable lead to win by more than four seconds.

        "content": "(CNN)The effects of the Australian bushfires on the country's animals have been immense and devastating, and the blazes show no signs of slowing. So the crafters won't slow down either. Volunteers with the Animal Rescue Craft Guild are nimbly sewing pouches and blankets for the orphaned and displaced animals, from kangaroo joeys to bats to sugar gliders, that have been injured in the blazes. The guild operates across five states in the country, though its membership extends much wider. Volunteers are given templates and free rein to create as many items as they can that will be donated to rescue centers taking the animals in. An orphaned koala joey is nestled in a pouch, sewn for it by a volunteer of the Animal Rescue Craft Guild. Avalon Llewellyn, volunteer and group administrator, joined the guild toward the middle of 2019 when it had only 1,000 members. Crafters initially made dog coats, blankets, cat sweaters. But as the fires worsened, their focus changed -- and their membership accelerated. By January 1, the guild had 23,000 members. Now, Llewellyn 120,000 have joined the call.Read MoreHalf a billion animals have been impacted by the blazesThe blazes, which have been burning across Australia for months, have scorched 18 million acres of land, impacting half a billion animals in New South Wales (NSW) alone. Millions of them could be dead, though it's too soon to tell as the fires worsen. The fires are particularly difficult on two of Australia's most beloved native species: Kangaroos and koalas. Nearly one-third of all koalas in NSW have died, and about a third of their habitat has been destroyed. Kangaroo joeys hang out in pouches-turned-hammock, designed to mimic their mothers' pouches.Most of the animals don't die during the fires, but in their aftermath. Orphaned animals are often starved and without shelter, making them easy prey. It's enough to make anyone feel helpless. But that's where the crafters come in. Over 100,000 members crafting for a causeMembers of the guild's Facebook group exchange tips, answer each others' questions and share photos of the crafts they proudly produced. A volunteer from Puerto Rico said her sewing had been temporarily interrupted by a 6.4-magnitude earthquake on the island but would resume as soon as her power returned. Other members prayed for her safety. There are some guidelines: Joey pouches and bat wraps must be hand sewn. Bird nests may be crocheted, but all must follow the templates provided. They should be made with cotton or linen -- whatever old bedsheets are made of. The softer, the better. \"Anything that can aid in the rehab of our wildlife,\" Llewellyn said. Their efforts are paying off -- last week, the group sewed 5,000 bat wraps, thousands more joey pouches and hundreds of blankets and towels. But that was the last count before membership boomed. A grumpy tawny frogmouth looks rather snuggly in its new crochet nest. Now, demand is highest for kangaroo joey pouches, wraps for bats and crocheted nests for displaced birds. Rescuers will take as many as crafters can make, as fast as their hands can make them. They get crafting help from prison groups, school-aged kids, elder care homes, she said. The group's caught the notice of international crafters thousands of miles away in the US, UK, Finland and Singapore, who are asked to donate directly to the cause or send sewn items along with Australian travelers.  Many of the group's members join because they don't know how else to help. But many of them have taken the initiative even further, hosting crafting \"bees\" to divvy up the sewing process and rack up their output. \"It's bringing together isolated members of the community, repurposing old sheets and linen and really give purpose to people who feel helpless,\" she said.

The area's local government, Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY), said in a memo posted on Facebook that \"extremely large groups of camels and other feral animals in and around communities\" are \"putting pressure on the remote Aboriginal communities\" as they search for water.\"With the current ongoing dry conditions the large camel congregations threatening the APY communities and infrastructure, camel control is needed,\" the note added.Australia's deadly wildfires are showing no signs of stopping. Here's what you need to knowThe cull will see professional shooters kill thousands of the creatures, with CNN affiliate Seven News reporting that 10,000 are at risk.Read MoreLike most of the country, South Australia has been sweltering under extremely high temperatures for weeks. Though not as badly hit as neighboring New South Wales, the state has suffered from the bushfires tearing through the country, blanketing cities in smoke and decimating native wildlife populations.Marita Baker, an APY board member, told The Australian newspaper that her community had been inundated by the creatures as they hunt for water. \"We have been stuck in stinking hot and uncomfortable conditions, feeling unwell, because the camels are coming in and knocking down fences, getting in around the houses and trying to get to water through air conditioners,'' she told the newspaper.The APY region is in an extremely remote area of South Australia and is sparsely populated. Only about 2,300 people live in the region, which is roughly the size of the US state of Kentucky. There are believed to be more than 1 million camels in Australia and the country's camel population is growing rapidly.Millions of animals are dying from the Australian fires, and the environment will suffer for years to comeCamels are far from the only species suffering in heat waves and wildfires. Various creatures have been found desperately approaching humans for something to drink in recent weeks, and last month a video of a koala chugging from a cyclist's water bottle went viral.In another grim, viral video posted on Twitter, a man drives into the fire-ravaged town of Batlow in New South Wales, filming both sides of the road littered with the charred remains of animals.It is estimated that hundreds of millions of animals have been killed by the blazes.Fires are nothing new in Australia, but they have been growing more intense and becoming more destructive in recent years, a problem that has been exacerbated by climate change. And animals have been on the front lines as Australia has the highest rate of species loss of any area in the world, and researchers fear that rate could increase as the fire disaster continues.CNN's Jessie Yeung contributed reporting.",

Rescuing the animals injured in the blazeThe animals, injured and confused by the devastating fires, are \"desperate\" to escape the flames, Terri Irwin said.\"The problem with koalas is they instinctively go to the tops of trees,\" Terri said. \"Eucalyptus trees have a very high oil content in the leaves, and when a hot fire hits a eucalyptus tree, they literally explode.\"Almost a third of koalas in Australia's New South Wales state may have been killed in bushfires, which have been burning out of control. In Kangaroo Island in South Australia, 25,000 koalas were killed in just one fire event, according to Terri. But the beloved fluffy marsupials are not the only animals severely threatened by the quickly moving fires.Like koalas, the gray-headed flying fox is another vulnerable species. The animals, which are native to Australia, escaped from earlier fires and droughts in Queensland to to New South Wales, where they are now once again threatened by fire.While the zoo's hospital specializes in koalas, it rescues and treats all kinds of animals including various bird species and bats.\"It's definitely working overtime for our vets and nurses to try and treat everyone that comes in here,\" Robert said.And unless the fires are put out soon, Terri said the \"hundreds of animals that we are seeing come in are going to rapidly turn into thousands.\"Saving the planet, saving the animals, saving humanityProtecting animals are a crucial part of saving the environment from further climate change. Animals such as fruit bats, which are the world's farthest-flying pollinators, are integral members of the ecosystem, according to Terri. \"Without them, we've got a lot of problems,\" she said.While wildlife hospitals running on tight budgets are struggling to handle the influx of injured animals, the effects of Australia's fires will impact these animals long after their recovery.Once animals are treated, they cannot be released unless there is a safe and viable habitat for them to return to. \"Vast tracks of land, some are saying up to 15 million acres, have been destroyed so far. And with months ahead of fires, it's very sobering,' Terri told Cooper.In the state of Queensland, where the Irwin family's wildlife hospital is located, there are 500,000 acres of habitat which have not been damaged by the fires, she said.So far, the weeklong state of emergency continues in New South Wales, as residents seek refuge from deadly bushfires. Three fires combined Saturday to form a single blaze bigger than the New York borough of Manhattan, as Australian firefighters battled what has been predicted to be the most catastrophic day yet in an already devastating bushfire season.At least 24 people have died in Australia's fires and in New South Wales alone, more than 1,300 houses have been destroyed.\"It is a battle for our ecosystem right now, and I think last year, 2019, was a year where we really saw a lot of things tip, whether it's glaciers melting, the fires in the Amazon, now it's hitting Australia,\" Terri said. \"Forevermore, we're now in a position where we're going to have to be more active to protect our environment.\"CNN's Alla Eschchenko, Nectar Gan, Hilary Whiteman, Mitchell McCluskey and Tara John contributed to this report.",

Aliens, flying discs and sightings -- oh my! A short history of UFOs in AmericaA former Pentagon official who led a secret government program to research potential UFOs, revealed in 2017, told CNN at the time that he believes there is evidence of alien life reaching Earth.Elsewhere in her interview, Sharman said there is \"no greater beauty than looking at the Earth from up high.\"\"I'll never forget the first time I saw it,\" she added.Sharman also discussed her frustration with observers defining her by her sex. \"People often describe me as the first British woman in space, but I was actually the first British person. It's telling that we would otherwise assume it was a man,\" she said. \"When Tim Peake went into space, some people simply forgot about me.

        "content": "(CNN)The most prolific rapist ever caught in Britain, who spent more than a decade luring dozens of intoxicated young men to his apartment before drugging and sexually assaulting them, has been sentenced to life imprisonment after being found guilty in four separate trials.Reynhard Sinaga was found guilty of 159 counts of sexual offenses against 48 different men, and must serve 30 years before he is considered for release. Police said the true number of his victims is likely to have been higher, having found evidence linking him to assaults on as many as 190 different people.Details of his campaign of assault were suppressed while trials were ongoing, but can now be published.Sinaga, 36, approached men in the early hours of the morning outside nightclubs in Manchester, striking up a conversation and offering them somewhere to sleep or promising them more alcohol.A university is handing out coasters that could detect date-rape drugs in drinksOnce he had brought them to his flat he would lace their drink with a drug -- most likely GHB, police said -- then film himself raping them while they slept. His comatose victims were unaware they had been assaulted.Read MoreSinaga's attacks only came to light in 2017, after an 18-year-old victim woke up at 6 a.m. while being assaulted. The victim managed to fight him off, and crucially was able to grab Sinaga's white iPhone before leaving the apartment.He went to police, who discovered 3.29 terabytes of graphic material on Sinaga's phone -- the equivalent to 250 DVDs. In some cases the assaults lasted hours, with one particular attack taking place for eight hours.Sinaga's victims, who were usually heterosexual and were often students, were seen snoring and in some cases vomiting while Sinaga raped them, Britain's Crown Prosecution Service said. When a groggy victim was starting to wake, Sinaga would push them back to the floor to continue his assault, or snatch away his phone to avoid suspicion. A photo of Sinaga's apartment where he raped dozens of men, released by Greater Manchester Police.Police believe he began the attacks in 2005 and continued until June 2017.\"Reynhard Sinaga is the most prolific rapist in British legal history,\" Ian Rushton, North West Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor, said. \"His extreme sense of sexual entitlement almost defies belief and he would no doubt still be adding to his staggering tally had he not been caught.Chilling texts mocking his victimsLittle was known about Sinaga and police had no record of him before the morning one of his victims escaped his apartment. He was ultimately found guilty in four separate trials, with cases split given the number of victims and assaults involved. Police said around 70 victims have not yet been identified.Juries heard how Sinaga kept victims' belongings as trophies and would look the men up on Facebook after assaulting them. He would also text friends to boast about his assaults. In one such message, he wrote of a comatose victim: \"He was straight in 2014. 2015 is his breakthrough to the gay world hahaha.\" In a phone conversation, he made a reference to a song by the group Little Mix, telling a friend: \"Take a sip of my secret potion, I'll make you fall in love.\"Phones of victims collected as \"trophies\" by Sinaga.His victims recounted that they rarely felt threatened by Sinaga, who had a slight build, according to the PA Media news agency. One victim said he seemed \"really nice\" and thought he had merely looked after him after his phone died and he had been separated from his friends on a night out.\"That night was just like any night out with my mates. What I didn't know was that there was a monster lurking in the background waiting to take advantage of my drunken state,\" PA quoted one victim as saying. \"I want Sinaga to acknowledge what he has done to me and show some remorse, but I doubt that will ever happen.\"Sinaga claimed in court that the men he attacked had in fact consented to have sex with him, and were pretending to be unconscious to fulfill his fantasy. Prosecutors branded that defense \"preposterous,\" PA reported.In court, he claimed victims had individually lied to police in order to not be outed as gay. \"It is not an easy thing for some people to come out as gay. That has probably influenced the way they want to answer it,\" PA quoted him as saying.Sinaga leaving his apartment building to prowl for victims, in CCTV footage released by police.\"They were probably scared that, 'what if my girlfriend finds out I was lying and that night I was with a man?'\"\"Sinaga's unthreatening demeanour duped these young men -- many of whom thanked him for his kindness in offering them a place to stay -- into thinking this monster was a Good Samaritan,\" Rushton added.\"But once back at his flat he used victims as objects purely for his own gratification -- then appears to have derived further twisted pleasure from re-watching his films in court and putting victims through the trauma of giving evidence.\"A churchgoer and PhD studentOriginally from Indonesia and born to a relatively wealthy family, Sinaga was a churchgoer who studied various university courses while living in Manchester, PA reported. He had been living in the UK on a student visa.He was studying for a PhD at the University of Leeds and would commute monthly from Manchester, where he had an apartment close to the city center.His thesis was entitled \"Sexuality and everyday transnationalism. South Asian gay and bisexual men in Manchester,\" PA reported.\"It is almost beyond belief that someone who could profess some Christian faith could at the same time have been committing such wicked and evil crimes,\" the judge said while delivering her verdict.\"You are an evil serial sexual predator who has preyed upon young men who came into the city center wanting nothing more than a good night out with their friends,\" she added.Alcoholic drinks in Sinaga's apartment.After the verdict was announced, the UK's Home Secretary, Priti Patel, called for an urgent review of legislation on date-rape drugs like Gamma-hydroxybutyrate, more commonly known as GHB. GHB is a powerful depressant and is a Class C drug in the UK, the third of three categories of criminalized substances. Those caught in possession of GHB can face an unlimited fine and up to two years in prison, compared with up to five years for Class B drugs and up to seven years for Class A drugs.Police have urged anyone who believes they may have been a victim of Sinaga, or who has information related to his crimes, to contact them on 0800 092 041 from within the UK or +44 207 158 0124 internationally. Reports can also be made online.",

Ash was falling from the building's air vents, covering around 500 people inside -- they were exhausted and overheated from fleeing the approaching fire. \"We got here and it felt like a death trap to be honest,\"  said Canadian Meaghan Wegg, 34, who sought refuge in the small theater along with her Australian-born husband Tim Buckley, 37, and her two children Georgia, 3, and Jackson, 5 on New Year's Eve.Wegg is one of the 4,000 people who fled to beaches as bushfires raged in Mallacoota, a family camping spot on the eastern edge of the state of Victoria. After six days sheltering in the cinema, Wegg and her family got evacuated to safety on January 5. But it will take a while for them to recover from the shock of their experience, she told CNN. Read MoreNo time to fleeThe family flew to Australia on December 27 from Montreal, Canada, to visit some relatives and friends at the Mallacoota Campground, a popular tourist destination. \"On December 31, we woke up and it was already 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) which is a danger watch and fire ban for campers, so we decided to take the kids to the beach to get some water play,\" Wegg said. \"We had a blast and stayed longer than we usually would have to keep cool in the water, took our time to get back in the air conditioning and as soon as we got there we had a 10-minute 'get out ASAP' call and the sirens were going off.\"The family packed quickly and drove to another beach. They set up a tent and mattress on the sand, and waited.

The fire was heading in the direction of the parking lot. We all left our cars because the fire was coming to the campground,\" she said. The wind started picking up around 4 a.m., and it became a sandstorm on the beach, Wegg said. \"We quickly tried to pack things up but had to leave lots ... ended up grabbing the kids and ... running through water to get to another shelter point, a campsite,\" she said. Inside the cinema Trucks were taking people to another shelter -- the cinema. \"After the ... wind passed we had a few more hours of waiting before they asked us to go outside with a mask to cool down as we were overheating,\" Wegg said. Wegg's husband left to help the firefighters take down the fires threatening the campsite near their tent. \"They ran out of water and he was filling up buckets from the campsite taps and running them into the bush with his friends, she said. Eventually, the family moved the tent and belongings close to the cinema, which then became the main shelter for about 100-200 people. \"That night we counted our blessings and it happened to be New Year's Day,\" Wegg said. For six days, the family slept on a crash mat, spending their time trying to keep the kids occupied. \"We managed to get our iPad plugged in and the kids had some games and shows to play,\" she said.

We made it as fun as we could, we gathered up 12 kids from friends and family and played games,\" she said. Waiting to be evacuatedLocal authorities drafted evacuation lists for the refugees. \"We had to line up to get our name on a list, then they took kids under 5 and families to be in air-evacuated lines -- and the rest on the boat. Helicopters kept trying to land but it was too smoky.\"The family drove through bush fires to get to the airport and waited. A helicopter circled for 40 minutes, but failed to land and went back to refuel before trying -- and failing -- again, Wegg said.          View this post on Instagram           We have hope!

Wegg and her family found themselves lying on the floor of the tiny airport with no power, waiting in the dark. \"By 11 p.m. they delivered sad news. Took us back in the shuttle to get to the shelter. We slept on the floor at the cinema but the Red Cross ladies were super-supportive and helpful,\" she said. After two more failed attempts, a Chinook helicopter finally managed to land and the family to safety. \"We are all safe and rested. A bit in shock, but good,\" she said.",

About 30 kilometers (19 miles) south, blood-red skies loomed over the town of Eden. There, hundreds of residents were seeking shelter on the beach on police advice, one Eden resident told CNN. Many houses have been destroyed in the area, and officials said they feared there would be fatalities.A total of 146 fires are burning across the state, with 65 uncontained, according to the NSW Rural Fire Service (NSWRFS). About 2,700 firefighters were tackling the blazes on Sunday.\"Conditions have eased today and firefighters have gained the upper hand on several dangerous fires. There are no total fire bans in place for Monday,\" the NSWRFS posted on Twitter.Read MoreA blood-red sky looms over Eden, New South Wales, on January 5, 2020.Earlier, NSWRFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told a news conference that Saturday was \"one of our worst days ever on record.\"A \"considerable number\" of properties were lost across NSW on Saturday, Fitzsimmons said, adding that a 47-year-old man had died from cardiac arrest while fighting a fire threatening his friend's home in Batlow. The man is the 24th person to die nationwide this fire season.Separately, four firefighters in NSW were hospitalized due to smoke inhalation, heat exhaustion and hand burns. They have since been released.Fitzsimmons said that conditions could worsen again in the coming days. \"Today will be a relief -- psychological relief but not what we need,\" he said. Fire-induced thunderstorms over New South Wales, seen from a flight on January 5, 2020.Australia's flag carrier Qantas canceled all flights to and from the country's capital, Canberra, on Sunday due to smoke and hazardous weather conditions.An airline passenger spotted huge clouds caused by the fires over NSW during a flight from Sydney to Melbourne on Sunday. They are pyrocumulonimbus clouds -- fire-induced thunderstorms -- which form when hot air rises from a ground based fire, according to CNN meteorologists. The air cools and condenses as it ascends, causing a cloud to form. \"This process is similar to the development of a thunderstorm,\" said CNN Weather's Derek Van Dam. \"As such, a downdraft forms within the base of the pyrocumulonimbus cloud, allowing for embers to be picked up and carried to form new fires.\" Photos: In photos: Bushfires rage through AustraliaAnimal rescuer Marcus Fillinger carries a burned kangaroo on February 4 in Peak View, Australia.

The fires joined overnight Friday in the Omeo region, creating a 6,000-hectare (23 square mile) blaze, according to Gippsland's Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning.Canberra smashed its heat record of 80 years, reaching 44 degrees Celsius (111 degrees Fahrenheit) on Saturday afternoon, according to the country's Bureau of Meteorology. In the western Sydney suburb of Penrith, the mercury climbed to 48.9 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit) -- setting a new record for the whole Sydney basin.Australia's deadly wildfires are showing no signs of stopping. Here's what you need to knowVictoria has declared a state of disaster, and NSW has declared a state of emergency -- both granting extraordinary powers and additional government resources to battle the fires.It marked the first time Victoria has activated these powers since the 2009 Black Saturday fires, the deadliest bushfire disaster on record in Australia with 173 people killed and 500 injured.Speaking at a news conference Sunday, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said it was another difficult night across the country -- in particular in NSW, Victoria and South Australia.Morrison -- who in December faced criticism for taking a vacation to Hawaii during the fires -- said the government's response was the most significant and comprehensive ever to a natural disaster. An eerie, smoke-filled landscape in Pambula, New South Wales, on January 5, 2020.\"I believe that's where we need to focus our attention, and we are seeking to communicate that directly to Australians to ensure they have comfort that the response is matching the need,\" he said.\"Sure there's been a lot of commentary, there's been plenty of criticism. I've had the benefit of a lot of analysis on a lot of issues. But I can't be distracted by that, and the public, I know, are not distracted by that. \"What they need us to focus on, all of us actually, all of us focusing on the needs there and getting the support where it needs to go. That's very much where my focus is, and that's where it will continue to be.\"In a news release on Sunday, the Australia Defence Force (ADF) said it was significantly increasing its support in fighting the massive fires and had called up 3,000 army reserve forces and others with specialist capabilities. An Australian army soldier helps people evacuate onto a Black Hawk helicopter in Omeo, Victoria on January 5, 2020.They will also provide aircraft, ships and its largest vessel, HMAS Adelaide, with helicopter landing capabilities. One priority for the ADF will be to assist in evacuations of people in isolated communities. HMAS Adelaide arrived off the coast of Eden on Sunday as evacuations took place there.  Some ADF bases will be opened to house those displaced by the fires. Troops will also help move material and supplies, support recovery centers, and aid in fire trail clearance.New Zealand and Singapore have also offered military support, and the ADF is assessing where they can help, the news release said.Members of the UK royal family sent their \"thoughts and prayers\" to Australians affected by the massive bushfires through social media accounts on Saturday. Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip issued a message of condolence expressing thanks to emergency services. \"I have been deeply saddened to hear of the continued bushfires and their devastating impact across many parts of Australia,\" the Queen wrote in a statement published on Twitter.On their Instagram account, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge said they were \"shocked and deeply saddened\" by \"the fires that are destroying homes, livelihoods and wildlife across much of Australia,\" posting a photo of a kangaroo with a burning building in the background.Meanwhile, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex urged support for those affected by the environmental crisis in an Instagram post linking to a number of Australian fundraisers, such as the Australian Red Cross, the Country Fire Authority and the New South Wales Rural Fire Service.CNN's Anna Coren, Nectar Gan, Jennifer Hauser, Angus Watson, Susanna Capelouto and Martin Goillandeau contributed reporting.",

        "content": "Eden, Australia (CNN)The Australian federal government department responsible for managing emergencies shut its Canberra office due to poor air quality on Monday as the nation's capital choked on smoke from deadly bushfires.On Monday, Canberra had a rating over 340 on the Air Quality Index -- higher than Beijing's 170. Australia has been ravaged by some of the worst wildfires seen in decades, with the massive blazes destroying homes, devastating wildlife, turning skies blood red and leaving a total of 24 people dead nationwide.The Department of Home Affairs told non-essential staff to stay away from its Canberra headquarters, while the Department of Health told staff not to work out of one of its locations. Child care services in the city were also shut.Visitors to Parliament House were forced to wear face masks after smoke from bushfires blankets Canberra in a haze on January 5.YWCA Canberra -- which operates a number of child care centers -- said that like many Canberra organizations, it had opted to close all of its children's services in the Australian Capital Territory and the rural New South Wales town of Murrumbateman on Monday due to \"hazardous smoke conditions.\"\"This is to ensure the health and well-being of our staff and the children in our services,\" YWCA Canberra said in a statement on its Facebook page. Read MoreCanberra's National Gallery of Australia was also closed on Monday due to the smoke. \"Closing our doors allows us to mitigate any risk to the public, staff and works of art on display,\" a statement on the gallery's website said. Elsewhere in Australia on Monday, cooler weather and rain gave firefighters some relief. Shane Fitzsimmons, commissioner of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service (NSW RFS), said Monday that the conditions were a \"welcome reprieve\" -- but it wasn't putting out the fires.\"It's a psychological relief if nothing else,\" he said, noting that the rains weren't helping with back burning, a method of controlled burning that helps limit the spread of blazes.

NSW RFS spokesman James Morris said firefighters needed weeks of consistent showers to ease the fire threat.\"We've seen drought conditions so the ground is very hard. If we get a lot of rain in a short period of time, it'll sit on the surface and run away,\" he said.There are 136 active blazes in NSW alone, including 69 that are uncontained, the NSW RFS said in a tweet early Monday. In Victoria state, there are still 31 active fires and more than 1.1 million hectares (4,247 square miles) of land has been burned, the Country Fire Authority said in a tweet.  On Sunday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison cautioned that for some states, the most difficult fire seasons could be later in January and February. \"The crisis is not over,\" he said. \"There are months to go.\"Government responseOn Monday, Morrison announced that he would establish a 2 billion Australian dollar ($1.39 billion) National Bushfire Recovery Agency to help people hit by the \"unprecedented bushfires\" get the support they needed.\"It's a long road ahead and we will be with these communities every step of the way as they rebuild,\" he said.With the Australia fires, is it safe to travel there now?The funds will be used to help \"get communities back on their feet\" by rebuilding roads, mental health support, and helping restore the local environment, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said.On Monday, the NSW police force said it had taken legal action against 183 people for bushfire-related offences since last November, including 24 who have been charged over allegedly deliberately-lit fires.Morrison has been criticized for taking a vacation to Hawaii during the fires. But on Sunday, he said the government's response was the most significant and comprehensive ever to a natural disaster.In a news release on Sunday, the Australia Defence Force said it was significantly increasing its fire support and had called up 3,000 army reservists and others with specialist capabilities.As of Monday, HMAS Adelaide -- the biggest vessel in the Royal Australian Navy's fleet -- was moored off the coast near Eden, a seaside town in NSW that was affected by fires over the weekend. The ship has space for up to 5,000 evacuees.JUST WATCHEDFire crews' life-or-death moments caught on videoReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFire crews' life-or-death moments caught on video 02:11What life is like for those affectedOver the weekend, thick smoke hung low over Eden, blocking out the sun and casting an ominous orange glow. On Sunday, police went door to door, boat to boat, telling people that it wasn't safe to stay. Some agreed to go, but others decided to stay put on informal evacuation centers -- a whale-watching tour boat and two tugboats moored at the wharf.On Monday, the red glow was gone and some people started returning to their homes. Ike, 5, and his sister Kalani, 6, with their mother Louise during a tense weekend on the family's fishing vessel where they took shelter from flames in Eden, NSW.Louise Warren said she had lived in Eden all her life and was accustomed to annual fires, but she had never seen anything like this.On Sunday, Warren, her husband and two children fled to the family's fishing trawler as the sky turned orange, then red, then black. \"I just want everything back to normal,\" she said.Kerrie Chester spent Saturday night on one of the tugs with up to 50 people, many children and elderly people, as well as the families' dogs. \"I haven't slept all night,\" Chester said Sunday. She spent the night outside on the wharf, watching to see if the fire leaped across the bay.\"I think it was the not knowing, because you couldn't see it across the bay,\" she said.CNN's Julia Hollingsworth wrote from Hong Kong, while journalist Hilary Whiteman reported and wrote from Eden, Australia.",

Luckily enough it led to the match-winner and a great goal,\" said Jones.\"It's massive for me and the rest of the young boys. At times it's frustrating thinking you might get a chance but then having to sit on the bench and watch. \"We proved that we are learning every day and trying to push for a place in the team.\"Japanese midfielder Takumi Minamino made his first appearance for Liverpool since signing from Red Bull Salzburg.It was a second consecutive defeat under new manager Carlo Ancelotti for Everton, which had started the game at Anfield brightly.Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Mason Holgate and Richarlison all forced excellent saves from Adrian in the first period as the visitors probed Liverpool's goal with a series of testing crosses. READ: Prince William narrates 60-second mental health film aimed at millions of soccer fansReds captain James Milner was first off injured after six minutes as he denied Calvert-Lewin in the box. He was replaced by 19-year-old Algerian Yasser Larouchi, making it four teenagers -- including 16-year-old Harvey Elliott -- on the pitch for Liverpool.But despite Everton's chances, the youthful home side showed composure and enjoyed plenty of possession and territory in the first period.Carlo Ancelotti has now won two and lost two games since taking over as Everton manager.After the break, Liverpool came out stronger and played with greater tempo. Everton, meanwhile, was lackluster.

        "content": "(CNN)Three fires have combined to form a single blaze bigger than the New York borough of Manhattan, as Australian firefighters battle what has been predicted to be the most catastrophic day yet in an already devastating bushfire season.The fires joined overnight in the Omeo region in Victoria state, creating a 6,000-hectare (23 square mile) blaze, according to Gippsland's Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning.In neighboring New South Wales state, a fire in the Wollondilly region south of the capital Sydney remains \"out of control,\" according to the Rural Fire Service. It has burned 264,000 hectares (1,020 square miles) of land in recent months.Firefighters tackle a bushfire in thick smoke in the town of Moruya, south of Batemans Bay, in the state of New South Wales on January 4.Weather conditions are deteriorating rapidly on Saturday, with the country's Bureau of Meteorology warning that winds are picking up and temperatures increasing. \"Today will be a day of severe to extreme fire danger through many districts,\" the bureau said.The country's capital, Canberra, smashed its heat record of 80 years, reaching 44 degrees Celsius (111 degrees Fahrenheit) on Saturday afternoon, according to the meteorology bureau. In the western Sydney suburb of Penrith, the mercury climbed to 48.9 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit) -- setting a new record for the whole Sydney basin.Read MoreThe death toll is rising as conditions worsen -- Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Saturday that 23 people had been killed nationwide, up from 18 from earlier in the week. More than 1,500 homes have also been destroyed since the fire season began in September. Victoria has declared a state of disaster and NSW has declared a state of emergency -- both granting extraordinary powers and additional government resources to battle the fires.It marked the first time Victoria has activated these powers since the 2009 Black Saturday fires, the deadliest bushfire disaster on record in Australia with 173 people killed and 500 injured.On Saturday, Morrison announced the deployment of up to 3,000 Australian Defense Force Reserve troops to affected states. Four planes will also be leased by the government to provide water bombing, while the navy's largest ship, HMAS Adelaide, will be mobilized to evacuate citizens along the coast.\"Today is about ensuring we deal with the urgent crisis that is existing across fire grounds in four states in particular, to ensure we're giving everything that is needed on ground without being asked,\" Morrison said at a press conference.Evacuations ahead of deteriorating weatherAll three branches of the ADF -- the navy, army, and air force -- have been working this week to rescue residents from fire-threatened areas and isolated towns cut off by closed roads. On Friday, the navy evacuated about 1,000 people from the Victoria beach town of Mallacoota, Morrison said.Some residents have chosen to stay and defend their homes, even with authorities urging people to get out while they can. Matt Runko, a homeowner in Moruya, NSW, departed late Friday -- but was forced to leave his neighbor behind.\"He's pretty confident he's got enough water and resources over there to fend it off,\" Runko told CNN -- but admitted it's \"definitely a little bit distressing\" that his neighbor was staying in the fire threat zone.     Saturday's hot, dry and windy weather is expected to hinder firefighters and worsen the flames, after a brief improvement in conditions on Thursday and Friday.The Bureau of Meteorology issued a severe weather warning on Saturday morning for \"damaging winds\" in NSW, the state hardest hit by fires so far. A passing cold front is causing temperatures to spike and humidity to drop, and bringing strong gusts up to 90 kilometers per hour (55 miles per hour) across the state's southeast.

Not only does it make the fires grow faster and bigger, but the wind can carry embers far distances and start entirely new fires in new locations.These winds will change directions once the cold front passes -- making the fires even more difficult to control. Some rain is expected by the end of the weekend heading into Monday, but won't be enough to extinguish the large ongoing blazes, according to CNN meteorologists.Angus Barners, an incident controller at the Rural Fire Service in Moruya, NSW, said he expected \"very challenging conditions.\"\"We can't stop the fires, all we can do is steer them around communities,\" he told CNN.CNN's Mitchell McCluskey contributed to this report",

        "content": "(CNN)Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison may have thought a visit to a fire-ravaged town would help boost his image after a series of stumbles in handling the country's bushfire crisis.That plan backfired Thursday in Cobargo, in the state of New South Wales, where residents made no bones about their anger.\"You won't be getting any votes down here, buddy. You're an idiot. Who votes Liberal round here? Nobody. No Liberal votes. You're out son. You are out,\" one man said, referring to Morrison's conservative party, according to footage from CNN affiliate Nine News. \"Go on, piss off!\"Another woman called the Australian leader a \"d*ckhead,\" while yet another said she would only shake his hand if he agreed to give more money to the country's volunteer firefighters. The embarrassed Prime Minister could do nothing but get back in his car and drive away. Amy and Ben Spencer on New Year's Eve at a showground in the southern New South Wales town of Bega, where they are camping after being evacuated.Deadly blazes have torn through huge swaths of Australia's east and south for months now, in the most brutal fire season seen there in years. Across the country, 23 people have been killed and about 6 million hectares (23,000 square miles) of bushland -- around the same size as Croatia -- have burned out.Read MoreThe devastation and persistent clouds of toxic smoke hanging over major towns and cities are begging the question, can Australia's way of life go on?The environmental situation won't change quickly, but in the dog-eat-dog world of Australian politics, the country's leadership is something that could change overnight. Climate and energy policies can make or break a leader. Morrison could be in trouble over the fire crisis. He was forced to return from a family holiday when the Australian media questioned why he was vacationing in Hawaii as so much of the country burned. He took weeks to declare a state of emergency, releasing a highly controversial religious discrimination bill at a news conference instead, while journalists fired tough questions at him over a lack of funding for volunteer firefighters. Morrison -- once a climate change skeptic who literally sang praises to a lump of coal in the Australian parliament -- should be worried about what people think of him in towns like Cobargo. The constituency has swung between the Liberal party and its center-left Labor rival several times since the 1940s and is one of Australia's most reliable bellwether seats.Most Australians want tougher action on climate change, according to the Australian Institute's Climate of the Nation survey. Some 81% of Australians are concerned that global warming will result in more droughts and flooding, while 64% think Australia should have a national target for net zero emissions by 2050.

Australia has voted for a conservative Liberal-National coalition government with a poor record on climate change for the last three elections, even reinstating Morrison as leader last May. Australia lacks a robust climate change policy, while the Morrison government stands accused of trying to use accounting trickery to meet the country's emission reduction targets under the Paris Agreement -- targets that critics say are too low in the first place -- while it also commits to new fossil fuel projects.Australia's political inaction on climate change can be hard to understand. Famous for its natural beauty, the country suffers annual fires and intense drought. It is regularly smashing heat records, and its rain patterns are becoming less predictable. Its seasons are beginning to look a little back to front -- wildfires began in 2019 at the end of August, during the Australian winter.A firefighter was killed in the Australia bushfires. His son received a medal to honor his father's braveryAbout 85% of Australians live within 50 kilometers (31 miles) of the coast, so projected sea level rises would have a dramatic impact on the way Australians live, studies show. Many Australians have also never experienced such intense fires as close to the coast as they have this summer. The country's biggest city, Sydney, has been shrouded in smoke more than 10 times hazardous levels on several days in the past two months. Its capital, Canberra, had the worst air quality in the world on Thursday, according to air pollution indexes.A study of the 2019 election by the Australian National University offers some insight into why Australians vote the way they do. Concern for climate change has never been so high in the country. Twenty-one percent of voters said either global warming or the environment were the most important issue affecting their vote. But out of 10 issues, it still comes third after economic management and the country's medical system.Labor is slowly losing its working-class votes to minor parties and, to a lesser extent, conservative alternatives. Older Australians are more likely to vote for the Liberal party, and Australia's population is aging.Although wages are starting to stagnate, life has been prosperous in Australia for a long time -- it is the only place on earth that has sustained economic growth for 28 years running.Beaches look like war zonesEconomics aside, Australia's climate and natural beauty makes its cities, like Sydney and Melbourne, some of the most liveable in the world. But that too is under threat. The beach, barbecues and sports that make up the Australian summer, and arguably part of its identity, have all been affected by the fires.  In Mallacoota, a small town in the southern state of Victoria, the population usually swells from about 1,500 to 8,000 during the Christmas period, as families with holiday homes and tourists swim, surf and sunbathe on the white sand beaches with azure waters. On New Year's Eve, those beaches weren't white and blue, but rather an \"apocalyptic\" red, as one resident put it, with about 4,000 people fleeing to them to escape a raging inferno.JUST WATCHEDFire crews' life-or-death moments caught on videoReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFire crews' life-or-death moments caught on video 02:11Better-known beaches, like Bondi in Sydney, have been unswimmable for much of the summer, as the air quality soared to hazardous levels. Many commuters now don face masks like they do in Beijing, which experts say do little to keep toxins out. Barbecues, another favorite Australian pastime, are banned in many areas, and sporting officials were monitoring the air quality ahead of the ATP Cup tennis tournament and a cricket Test match between Australia and New Zealand in Sydney this week.If Australians want to retain their quality of life, they must consider climate change policies that not only address fires, but also other pollutants, such as traffic and industry, according to Ilan Kelman from the University College of London's Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction. Kelman pointed to London's Ultra Low Emissions Zone policy as a good example of a city that has addressed traffic pollution, by charging people who drive into the city center and by investing in clean-energy public transport. \"People make the decision to live in a mega-city, whether Sydney or London, and we know these risks come. And if we choose to live there, we should be convincing our politicians, and electing our politicians, who will deal with air quality, as London has done,\" he said. \"Otherwise, they'll have to accept all these life impacts which bad air brings.\"",

About 20 million of the Bank of England's new polymer \u00a35 ($6.54) notes have been replaced in the first three years since they were introduced in 2016, and around 26 million plastic \u00a310 notes have also been replaced by the Bank since their September 2017 launch, PA reported, citing figures obtained through Freedom of Information requests.Plastic bills -- made of polymers instead of traditional paper materials -- were introduced into circulation by the Bank of England in 2016. According to Bank of England figures, there were around 400 million \u00a35 bills and 1 billion \u00a310 bills in circulation in 2019.Andrew Bailey is a safe choice to lead the Bank of England in uncertain timesThe first plastic note -- worth \u00a35 --  bore the face of wartime leader Winston Churchill, followed by the \u00a310 note featuring author Jane Austen. A polymer \u00a320 note, featuring English painter JMW Turner, is due to be released in 2020.Read MoreIn the latest Bank of England annual report, Bank of England governor Mark Carney said polymer notes \"last more than twice as long\" as paper notes. \"Polymer notes are safer than paper notes, and last more than twice as long. They are also better for the environment due to both their longevity and recyclability,\" Carney said in the bank's 2019 report. The report also states: \"Our decision to move to polymer notes will deliver lasting environmental benefits due to their durability.\" The bank said the damage to the bills \"mainly relates to folds, tears, holes and foil wear\" and is \"consistent with the general wear\" expected for bank notes.CNN has contacted the Bank of England for comment. The plastic notes have previously courted controversy after the Bank confirmed that traces of tallow, derived from animal fat, could be found in the currency.",

He also said British people -- particularly men -- should feel comfortable talking about mental health issues.\"I think when you are bereaved at a very young age -- any time really, but particularly at a young age, I can resonate closely to that -- you feel pain like no other pain, and you know that in your life it's going to be very difficult to come across something that's going to be even worse pain than that,\" William said.He added: \"Particularly in Britain as well, we are nervous about our emotions. We're a bit embarrassed at times. You know, the British 'stiff upper lip' thing -- that's great, and we need to have that occasionally, when times are really hard there has to be a moment for that.\"But otherwise, we've got to relax a little bit, and be able to talk about our emotions, because we're not robots.\"There are more than 15 million football fans in England, 69% of whom are men, according to PHE.A YouGov survey commissioned by PHE shows men in England are less likely than women to seek help or take self-care actions to address common mental health concerns.In October, Prince William and Prince George, along with the Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Charlotte, were spotted celebrating in the stands as their favorite team Aston Villa thrashed Norwich 5-1 in the English Premier League.",

        "content": "(CNN)A judge has ruled that ethical veganism qualifies as a philosophical belief protected under UK law.Jordi Casamitjana, an \"ethical vegan,\" claims he was dismissed by his employer, animal welfare charity the League Against Cruel Sports, in April 2018 because he informed colleagues that their employer's pension fund was \"being invested in companies that experiment on animals\" and non-ethical funds -- a claim the charity has rejected. Ethical vegans not only follow a vegan diet, but also oppose the use of animals for any purpose, such as animal testing.At an employment tribunal on Friday, judge Robin Postle said he was \"satisfied overwhelmingly\" that ethical veganism meets the criteria of the Equality Act to qualify as a philosophical belief. In a short summary judgment, Postle declared that veganism \"clearly in my view meets all the criteria; It is a philosophical belief, not just an opinion.\"Read More \"It is cogent, serious and important, and worthy of respect in democratic society,\" he added.Vegan sneakers set to be next sustainable plant-based craze in 2020Casamitjana brought the landmark legal case to court on Thursday, hoping to force a change to Britain's Equality Act that would see veganism included as a philosophical belief protected from discrimination.The law, passed in 2010, defines \"religion or belief\" as one of the nine \"protected characteristics,\" which include race, sex, pregnancy and maternity and sexuality, making it unlawful for employers to discriminate on those grounds.For Casamitjana to qualify for protection under the act, his lawyers had to prove that veganism is \"a belief and not an opinion,\" that it has \"a certain level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance,\" and that it is \"worthy of respect in a democratic society, compatible with human dignity and not conflict with the fundamental rights of others.\"Casamitjana expressed his satisfaction with the judgment. As we mark World Vegan Day, here are four great reasons to give animal products a miss\"I'm extremely happy with the outcome of this hearing and for the words of the judge who clearly understood what ethical veganism is. I didn't expect to have a judgement today but the overwhelming weight of the evidence we have provided seems to have been sufficient for the judge to conclude that I'm the ethical vegan I say I am, and that ethical veganism is a protected 'non-religious philosophical belief,'\" he said in a statement. \"I am not alone. Many people have supported me because they, or their friends, have experienced discrimination for being ethical vegans. Hopefully, from my dismissal, something positive will come by ensuring other ethical vegans are better protected in the future,\" he added. Peter Daly, the employment lawyer representing Casamitjana, said the recognition of ethical veganism as a protected characteristic under the Equality Act 2010 would have \"potentially significant effects on employment and the workplace, education, transport and the provision of goods and services.\"A vegan man claims Burger King cooked Impossible Whopper alongside meat\"I'm pleased with how the hearing today has gone and we look forward to receiving the full judgement in due course. This was the first of a two part employment tribunal. Now the question of ethical veganism has been determined by the judge, the litigation will move on to determine the lawfulness of Jordi's treatment by the League Against Cruel Sports,\" Daly said in a statement. Casamitjana argued that identifying as an ethical vegan involves \"much more than just not eating food with animal ingredients,\" and is a \"philosophy and a belief system\" encompassing most aspects of his life.Rhys Wyborn, employment partner at law firm Shakespeare Martineau, who acted for the League Against Cruel Sports, said: \"Although an interesting point of law, this hearing was preparation for the real crux of the matter: why Jordi Casamitjana was dismissed. In view of its animal welfare value, the League did not contest the issue of whether ethical veganism itself should be a protected belief, with the League maintaining that it's irrelevant to the core reason for the dismissal. \"The League is now looking ahead to the substantive hearing in this case and to addressing the reason for Mr. Casamitjana's dismissal, which it maintains was due to his misconduct and not the belief he holds.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)A New Year, but the same relentless, history-making Liverpool. Jurgen Klopp's side is perched atop the Premier League by a handsome, some would argue, unassailable margin, and the team's 2-0 victory over Sheffield United Thursday ensured it picked up some more records, as well as points, in what has been a remarkable 12 months for the club.Liverpool dominated United, making 874 successful passes in the match -- the most in Premier League history since data has been collected by Opta -- and recorded its 18th consecutive Premier League win at Anfield. Club World Cup: Roberto Firmino extra time winner as Liverpool sees off FlamengoAnd, perhaps most special of all, in beating United -- a team currently eighth in the league and defying the odds after promotion from the Championship -- Liverpool became only the third team to go unbeaten over a year in the Premier League, joining Chelsea and Arsenal in the record books. Since losing to Manchester City on January 3, 2019, the Merseysiders have played 37 league games without defeat. Over the course of its 12-month unbeaten run, Liverpool has won 32 of 37 league games, collecting 101 points from a possible 111, according to the Premier League. Read MoreChelsea went 40 games unbeaten from October 2004 to November 2005, while Arsenal's 49-game unbeaten run -- which remains a record no English Football League team has matched -- included going the entire 2003-04 season unbeaten. The Reds are still 12 matches short of Arsenal's record, and after Thursday's victory captain Jordan Henderson said surpassing the Gunners, or even going the entire season unbeaten like Arsenal's famed \"Invincibles,\" was not at the forefront of the players' minds. That will not stop fans and pundits speculating about the possibility of an undefeated season, however. 874 - Liverpool completed 874 passes against Sheffield United this evening; their most in a Premier League game since Opta have this data recorded (since the 2003-04 season), with only Manchester City managing more in a game in this period (three times). Untouchable. pic.twitter.com/EnaMAJTuMF\u2014 OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) January 2, 2020\n\nLiverpool is without doubt in a commanding position in the league -- 13 points ahead of nearest rivals Leicester City and with a game in hand. This season, the team's record reads: 19 wins, one draw, no losses. The 1-1 draw against Manchester United in the autumn is the only time Klopp's men have dropped points in the league. Indeed, domestic defeats have come only in cup competitions -- in the FA Cup to Wolves last January and to Aston Villa in the Carabao Cup last month, albeit with a youthful, depleted side as the senior squad was competing in Fifa's Club World Cup, which it went on to win for the first time in the club's history. But for all the victories, the records and the titles won on foreign soil -- Liverpool is the first English side to hold the Champions League, Uefa Super Cup and Fifa Club World Cup simultaneously -- Klopp's side did not win any domestic trophies in 2019. Consequently, many fans remain cautious as the team attempts to win a first league title in 30 years. Though it accumulated 97 points in the league last season -- the third-highest in Premier League history -- and won nine matches on the trot during a nail-biting run-in, Liverpool was still pipped to the title by Manchester City. Mohamed Salah has scored 10 Premier League goals this season. Preventing the pessimists from getting carried away is the fact that last year  Liverpool became the only team to go into the new year seven points clear and not win the title. Runaway Premier League leader Liverpool may be, but tough games are to come this month alone, which could bring an end to the team's unbeaten run and make the second half of the season a little more anxious  -- there's an away game to Tottenham on January 11, and a visit to Anfield by Manchester United eight days' later. Liverpool has always struggled in January during Klopp's tenure, but such is Liverpool's lead, it can afford to squander a few points here and there. According to Opta, only Manchester City in 2017-18 has accumulated as many points as Liverpool from its first 20 Premier League games (both 58). If Klopp's men continue their excellent form, keep up with the astonishing pace set in the first half of the campaign, a first Premier League title could be theirs in the spring. It could even be sealed against Manchester City at the Etihad on April 4.Liverpool has never had it so good in the Premier League. But the best could yet be to come.",

        "content": "(CNN)Australian authorities are launching naval and air rescue operations along the country's southeast coast as deadly wildfires intensify, stranding residents and tourists in towns that may be wiped out by Saturday.The Australian Defence Force (ADF) sent navy vessels on Friday to the fire-threatened town of Mallacoota, in Victoria state, where thousands of people fled their homes and sought refuge on a beach earlier this week. More than 960 people will be evacuated on Friday to Western Port, south of Melbourne, the ADF said.Photos from Mallacoota show people wearing face masks and lining up to board the vessels, with the air blanketed in yellow haze and smoke.Australian navy vessels conducting evacuation and relief operations in Mallacoota, Victoria.The state's premier Daniel Andrews warned residents in similar fire-stricken zones to evacuate, warning on Friday that \"we cannot guarantee your safety.\"Authorities in neighboring New South Wales state are also urging residents to abandon entire towns that lie in the path of intensifying fires. Already, some towns have been virtually burned to the ground -- across NSW, 1,365 homes have been destroyed and more than 500 damaged this fire season.Read MoreFire-damaged buildings in Sarsfield, Victoria, on January 3, 2020.The town of Batlow, home to more than 1,300 people, is forecast to be hit Saturday and \"will not be defendable,\" warned the NSW Rural Fire Service on Thursday. \"It is not safe. Do not be in this area.\"The announcement sparked an outpouring of grief and sympathy on social media, with many mourning the possible loss of the town's beloved fruit orchards -- Batlow is one of Australia's major apple producers, and agriculture lies at the heart of the community.NSW is under a state of emergency, and Victoria has declared a state of disaster in six areas, ahead of worsening weather conditions forecast for Saturday. Meteorologists predict extremely hot, dry, and windy weather -- a dangerous combination that hinders firefighters and makes the fires spread quicker and farther.The navy vessels will evacuate more than 900 people from Mallacoota on Friday. Similar conditions on Monday and Tuesday led to a devastating 24 hours that destroyed hundreds of homes and killed seven people. In total, 18 people have died across Australia during this fire season.Weather conditions have improved slightly Thursday and Friday, and authorities are now racing against time to get people out of fire-threatened areas before the situation worsens again Saturday.Highways were jammed for hours on Thursday, with fallen trees and fire danger closing down major roads. Many people slept in their cars overnight, parked on the highway, waiting for the roads to open so they could evacuate loved ones in isolated areas.Roadblocks outside the town of Orbost in Victoria, Australia, on January 2, 2020.Canberra resident Penny Tynan waited at a road block outside the NSW town of Nowra for 10 hours on Thursday, frustrated and anxious. Since Monday, she hasn't been able to contact her mother, who lives in a nursing home, or her 14-year-old autistic daughter, who was visiting.\"We want to pick her up and get her out of there before Saturday,\" Tynan said. \"She's autistic, she would have been terrified.\"As of Friday, 127 fires are burning in NSW, of which 67 are not contained. A total of 2,100 firefighters are on the ground in the state. In Victoria, 28 people are unaccounted for -- a jump from 17 reported on Thursday.'We need more help'All three services of the ADF -- the army, navy and air force -- are working with state authorities on emergency response. Apart from the naval operation at Mallacoota, the ADF has also provided aircraft for water bombing and air evacuations, and army personnel for ground support, helping ease some of the pressure on firefighters.Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Friday that federal agencies are also working to set up evacuation centers and provide accommodation to evacuees.\"This is a ferocious fire,\" he said. \"We are doing everything to support (people affected) in this time of need.\" Photos: In photos: Bushfires rage through AustraliaAnimal rescuer Marcus Fillinger carries a burned kangaroo on February 4 in Peak View, Australia.

Many are also angry that he had taken a holiday in Hawaii in December as the blazes raged -- which he ended up cutting short, and apologized for.Morrison was heckled and cursed at on Thursday when he visited the fire-hit NSW town of Cobargo, in what was supposed to be a visit with victims. One woman said she would only shake his hand if he gave more funding to the NSW Rural Fire Service. \"It's all coming,\" Morrison said, shaking her hand. He then walked away as she called after him, \"We need more help.\"Another group was more explicit, yelling out \"you're an idiot,\" and \"you're not welcome.\" Morrison left without responding.JUST WATCHEDAustralian PM heckled by angry residents about bushfiresReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAustralian PM heckled by angry residents about bushfires 01:33When asked about the confrontations on Friday, Morrison said he had \"stood with\" the woman in discussing fire service support, and that he had been \"pleased\" to see the community's resilience.\"People are angry, I understand,\" he added. \"People have suffered great loss. They are hurting and raw, that is what happens in natural disasters.\"Australia's deadly wildfires are showing no signs of stopping. Here's what you need to knowMorrison has also been accused of not doing enough to address climate change, which experts say is making natural disasters like fires go from bad to worse. Summers in Australia are always hot and dry -- but fire seasons have been arriving earlier and spreading with greater intensity, and weather conditions are growing more extreme.\"I certainly haven't seen anything like this before,\" Angela Burford, spokeswoman for the NSW Rural Fire Service, told CNN on Friday. \"This fire season in New South Wales is something that is certainly unprecedented.\"Morrison acknowledged on Thursday that the climate crisis has affected fire seasons in Australia -- but cautioned that the government needed \"sensible\" policies, and that there wasn't \"a single policy, whether it be climate or otherwise,\" that could completely protect Australia from the fires.",

        "content": "(CNN)Austria's conservative leader Sebastian Kurz has agreed to plans with his new Green partners to extend a headscarf ban in schools and introduce preventive custody for potentially dangerous asylum seekers under a new coalition government deal that also lays out ambitious targets to tackle the climate crisis, Reuters reported.Sebastian Kurz, leader of the Austrian People's Party, will resume the chancellorship after ironing out a deal on New Year's Day with Werner Kogler of the Greens, bringing the party into national government for the first time.Speaking at an event outlining the details of the agreement Thursday, Kurz said it was \"the best of both worlds\" and allowed both parties to keep their campaign pledges, Reuters reported.For the conservatives, those pledges included a continuation of their hard-line immigration stance and fight against \"political Islam,\" along with lower taxes, while the Greens had promised to usher in environmental measures and greater government transparency.The deal must still be approved by the Greens' decision-making body, the Federal Council, on Saturday, according to Reuters. And while it is expected to pass, the immigration and security measures proposed by Kurz's conservatives are likely to be an uncomfortable compromise for the Greens. They are the junior partner in the pact.Read MoreOne of the world's youngest leaders returns in Austria after scandal brought his government downThe agreement -- reached some three months after the country's general election -- was perceived as a slight swing to the left for the Austrian government, which was previously led by Kurz under a coalition agreement with the far-right Freedom Party. But, as the two leaders unveiled the program, it appeared the conservatives did not have to give up much ground as part of the alliance.The deal includes an extension of a ban on headscarves for girls in school, raising the age until which they're prohibited to 14, up from 10 -- an expansion of a policy introduced previously under Kurz.It also breathes back life into a controversial plan for preventive custody of potentially dangerous migrants.Despite these far-right policies, Kogler hailed the environmental successes he was able to incorporate into the program, such as a tax on flights out of Austria, investment in public transport and aiming to become carbon neutral by 2040 -- a decade earlier than the European Union target.Video scandalWhile the Freedom Party suffered significant losses in the September election, the Greens gained almost nine points, securing 12.4% of the vote.Kogler, who has led the Green Party since October 2017, has pledged to introduce greater transparency within the Austrian government.\"Austria will, I believe, have the most intense and largest transparency packages in recent decades, with an offensive towards free information and towards a transparent state,\" he told reporters.Kurz, who will lead the coalition as Chancellor, added that this new coalition government will aim to \"protect the climate and the borders,\" re-asserting his party's commitment to curbing illegal immigration.Secretly recorded video casts harsh light on Europe's far right\"It is possible to reduce the tax burden and to ecologize the tax system. And it is possible to protect the climate and the borders,\" Kurz said, adding that his government will implement \"measures against illegal migration and political Islam\" in Austria.  Kurz's People's Party came first in the country's general election in September, winning in every federal state except the capital, Vienna, according to the Austrian Interior Ministry. The election was triggered after Kurz and his right-wing coalition government lost a vote of no confidence in May, making him the first Austrian Chancellor since World War II to be defeated by a no-confidence motion.The vote was prompted by a corruption scandal over a secretly-filmed video. It showed former Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache, from the far-right Freedom Party, appearing to offer state contracts to a woman falsely claiming to be the niece of a Russian oligarch.Strache denied any wrongdoing and resigned after the tape was revealed.",

        "content": "London (CNN)A vegan sacked by his employer is bringing a landmark legal case to a British court on Thursday, hoping to change the law to ensure that veganism is considered a protected \"philosophical belief\" similar to religion.Jordi Casamitjana, an \"ethical vegan,\" claims he was dismissed by animal welfare charity League Against Cruel Sports in April 2018 because he informed colleagues that their employer's pension fund was \"being invested in companies that experiment on animals\" and non-ethical funds -- a claim the charity has rejected.Greggs beefs up its vegan range with launch of meat-free steak bake But before challenging his former employer over his firing, Casamitjana is hoping to force a change to Britain's Equality Act that would see veganism included as a philosophical belief protected from discrimination.A two-day case began in Norwich, England on Thursday.The law, passed in 2010, defines \"religion or belief\" as one of the nine \"protected characteristics,\" which include race, sex, pregnancy and maternity, making it unlawful for employers to discriminate on those grounds.Read MoreTo qualify for protection under the act, Casamitjana's lawyers must prove that veganism is \"a belief and not an opinion,\" that it has \"a certain level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance,\" and that it is \"worthy of respect in a democratic society, compatible with human dignity and not conflict with the fundamental rights of others.\"Ethical vegans not only follow a vegan diet, but also oppose the use of animals for any purpose, such as wearing fur or animal testing.Casamitjana argues that identifying as an ethical vegan involves \"much more than just not eating food with animal ingredients,\" and is a \"philosophy and a belief system\" encompassing most aspects of his life. Veganism has 'informed my daily existence'\"Ethical veganism is a philosophical belief held by a significant and growing portion of the population in the UK and around the world,\" Peter Daly, Casamitjana's legal representative at the Slater and Gordon law firm, added in a statement. \"This case, if successful, will establish that the belief entitles ethical vegans protection from discrimination.\"The League Against Cruel Sports is not disputing Casamitjana's case for veganism to be afforded protected status. Later in the year, the former employee plans to bring a separate case in which he will claim his own dismissal contravened his philosophical belief, which the charity opposes.Veganism could get the same legal protections as religion The company says he was sacked for gross misconduct.\"The discussion about veganism being a 'philosophical belief' is a thought-provoking one which many of our staff will be interested in -- however this debate has absolutely no connection with why Mr. Casamitjana was sacked,\" a spokesperson told CNN late last year.\"Casamitjana was not dismissed because he raised concerns about the pension, either internally or externally, so there is no substance to his claims that he was 'whistleblowing.'\"Casamitjana has raised \u00a38,700 ($11,500) for his case through a crowdfunding website. On his page, he writes that ethical veganism has \"informed my daily existence, including my career and employment.\"\"I have been an ethical vegan for over seventeen years, and it is as an ethical vegan that I live all aspects of my life as far as this is reasonably practical. This means that I do not eat, wear or consume any animal products,\" he adds.If Casamitjana is successful, the UK will become one of the first major countries to write specific protections for vegans into law. It would mark a milestone for veganism, which grew in popularity throughout the 2010s, and would likely prompt similar legal pushes around the world.

New South Wales and Franz Josef glaciers are more than 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) apart.New Zealand's former prime minister Helen Clark tweeted that the impact of Australian ash on glaciers \"is likely to accelerate melting.\" How one country's tragedy has spillover effects: Australian bushfires have created haze in New Zealand with particular impact on the south of the South Island yesterday & now spreading more widely.

        "content": "(CNN)The Australian state of New South Wales has declared a state of emergency and could begin forced evacuations from fire-stricken areas, as emergency crews battle deadly blazes and brace for a dangerous weekend ahead.State Premier Gladys Berejiklian said Thursday that the emergency declaration would come into effect Friday morning as weather conditions are expected to deteriorate significantly on Saturday, raising the fire danger even further.This is the third time NSW has declared a state of emergency in as many months -- the last two times, in November and December, were also for seven days, and granted extraordinary powers to the Rural Fire Service.Berejiklian said residents could also be subject to forced evacuations, road closures and any other means necessary to keep people safe.\"We want to make sure we are taking every single precaution to be prepared for what could be a horrible day on Saturday,\" she said.Read More     Thousands of people were already fleeing the state's south coast on Thursday, with the Rural Fire Service setting up a \"tourist leave zone\" from the town of Batemans Bay down to the Victoria border. All visitors were urged to evacuate before Saturday, when temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit), dry conditions and ferocious winds are expected to heighten the risk of further blazes.\"These will be dangerous conditions,\" the fire service warned. \"Do not be in this area on Saturday.\"Thousands are evacuating from the coastSimilar hot, windy weather on Tuesday led to massive fires spreading out of control. Seven people died from the fires within 24 hours. Conditions improved slightly on Thursday -- creating a small window of opportunity for people to evacuate before the situation worsens again Saturday.Tens of thousands of people are estimated to be in the south coast region, home to seaside towns that swell in population during summer.Residents on Thursday were heeding the warning. Hundreds if not thousands of cars were backed up in small towns south of Nowra, on the southern coast, according to police. Roads away from the tourist area were packed with long lines of cars waiting to leave, and one major road heading south beyond Nowra was closed due to a fire that jumped the highway.Some people had been waiting in line for hours and were getting frustrated, with little indication of when the road will open.A firefighter in the New South Wales town of Jerrawangala on January 1, 2020. Nowra resident Trevor Garland was one of those trying to head south -- his 16-year-old daughter was stranded in the NSW town Sussex Inlet, where she was visiting a friend.\"The big picture is one road in, one road out,\" he told CNN on Thursday. \"I'm going to wait here all night if I have to.\"Rob O'Neill had been waiting for six hours at the roadblock. He was also trying to head south to find his children, aged 4 and 5, who are staying with their grandparents. He said he hadn't been able to contact them since Monday, and the fire line had moved as close as several hundred feet from the grandparents' house.\"We want to get them out before Saturday comes. Predictions are pretty bad for Saturday,\" he said. \"Not knowing is pretty scary -- we don't know how they're going.\"Authorities are working to clear the backlog and reach the cut-off areas. In neighboring Victoria state, there are 24 such isolated communities, according to Premier Daniel Andrews -- including the town of Mallacoota, where thousands of residents fled their homes to seek refuge at the beach on Monday.The Australian military assisting with bushfire evacuations.A navy vessel will make multiple trips in Mallacoota on Friday to transport up to 800 residents and tourists to an unspecified safe location, Andrews said Thursday. Air evacuations could also happen once dense smoke begins to move away from the area.Scenes from the ground show military personnel in trucks and rubber dinghies, rescuing stranded residents and shrouded in yellow haze.Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Thursday that the federal government was also sending resources when requested by states, including additional funding and military support from the Australian Defence Force. He warned that many areas were difficult for emergency personnel to safely access, and urged residents to remain calm and patient.Australia's deadly wildfires are showing no signs of stopping. Here's what you need to knowExperts say climate change has worsened the scale and impact of the fires, and many have accused the Morrison administration of doing little to address the climate crisis. In December, a woman dumped the remnants of her fire-ravaged home in front of the Australian parliament, accusing Morrison and lawmakers of failing to act.Morrison faced heat from those living in the middle of the bushfire danger zone Thursday on what was supposed to be a visit with victims. One woman said she would only shake his hand in order to get more money for the Rural Fire Service while another group yelled out \"you're an idiot\" and \"piss off\" as he walked away from them while on a stop in the town of Cobargo.Morrison said Thursday his government aimed to \"meet and beat our emissions reduction targets\" -- but added that it would stick to \"sensible\" policies that \"don't move toward either extreme.\"\"The suggestion that there is a single policy, whether it be climate or otherwise, (that) can provide a complete insurance policy on fires in Australia -- well, I don't think any Australian has ever understood that was the case in this country,\" he said.Climate change and the fire crisisThe Australian fires have been burning for months now, and aren't likely to stop anytime soon -- Australia is still in the early months of summer, and temperatures typically peak in January and February. \"The fire season still has a long time to run,\" Morrison said in a news conference.A total of 17 people have died across the country so far, with the most damage concentrated in NSW. Across the state, nearly 1,300 homes have been destroyed and another 442 damaged, according to the Rural Fire Service. Fires have consumed entire towns and ripped through bushland; the strong winds frequently change directions, which fan the flames and carry embers far distances.

Read MoreA \"Tourist Leave Zone\" has been established through swaths of New South Wales, from Batemans Bay down to the Victoria border.The Rural Fire Service is urging all visitors there to flee before Saturday, when temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit), dry conditions and ferocious winds are expected to heighten the risk of further deadly blazes.Thousands of Australian residents had to take refuge on a beach as wildfires ragedThe past few days have seen fires intensify across the state, whipped up and spread far by strong winds. As of Thursday there are 106 fires burning across the state and more than 2,500 firefighters on the ground, according to the NSW Rural Fire Service (NSWRFS).Fires are also burning in the neighboring state of Victoria, where lightning strikes in drought-hit bushland sparked rapid blazes that forced one town's residents to flee their homes and seek refuge at the beach Tuesday.The nationwide death toll has risen to 17 as state and federal authorities struggle to bring the fires under control. In NSW, volunteer firefighter died on Monday, and two other firefighters died earlier in December.A firefighter in the town of Nowra, New South Wales, on December 31, 2019.Every state in Australia has been struck by the fire season, one of the worst in decades, but NSW has been hardest hit -- fires have burned more than 3.6 million hectares of land statewide since July. Some of the devastation is occurring in national parks and forests, but the fires have also ripped through towns and sparsely populated areas -- so far, nearly 1,300 homes have been destroyed and another 442 damaged, according to the NSWRFS.ABC photographer Matt Roberts reacts to seeing his sister's house destroyed by a bushfire in New South Wales, Australia.\nAuthorities in NSW are working to fight the flames, conduct search and rescue operations, clean up destruction, and assist affected residents. It's not just that fires are burning through land and destroying homes -- they have also caused a host of dire infrastructure issues. In some places, communication services and power have been cut, and roads have been closed, isolating entire towns from much-needed resources.

Another poignant photo shows a mug placed on his coffin, with the words: \"Daddy I love you to the moon and back!,\" inscribed on it.

On Thursday, NSW declared a state of emergency for the third time in as many months as emergency crews battle\u00a0deadly\u00a0blazes and prepare for a dangerous weekend ahead.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his wife, Jenny attended Keaton's service. He tweeted: \"This morning Jenny will join me as we remember and give thanks for the life and service of Geoff Keaton at his memorial with his partner Jess, his son Harvey and all his family and friends, especially those from the Horsley Park RFS Brigade.\"Morrison has come under pressure for his handling of the bushfires -- and the climate crisis more generally. Hundreds attended Keaton's funeral and a guard of honor was formed at the service.Morrison faced tough questions on Thursday from those living in the middle of the bushfire danger zone.One woman said she would only shake his hand in order to get more money for the Rural Fire Service while another group yelled out \"you're an idiot\" and \"piss off\" as he walked away from them while on a stop in the town of Cobargo.Morrison said his government aimed to \"meet and beat our emissions reduction targets\" -- but added that it would stick to \"sensible\" policies that \"don't move toward either extreme.\"The NSW Rural Fire service has set up dedicated bank accounts to collect donations for the families of volunteer firefighters who have been killed while on duty this fire season.",

Pogba-less Man Utd slips to New Year's Day defeat at ArsenalREAD: Teenage wonderkid Haland joins DortmundSolskjaer told reporters Wednesday that the Frenchman would likely be out for \"three or four weeks.\"Read More\"We've had scans and it's nothing major, but it's something that has to be dealt with,\" said the Manchester United boss. \"He's been advised to do it as soon as and we will probably do it as soon as, so he will be out for three or four weeks.\" Pogba has featured in just eight games for Manchester United this season -- most recently against Newcastle United on Boxing Day.'Shut your agent down'Much has been written about Pogba's relationship with United. Rumors of a January transfer have been circulating, though Solskjaer told reporters in December that Pogba would not be sold in the January transfer window. But Pogba's agent Mino Raiola appeared to stoke the flames this week by telling Italian newspaper La Republica that he would not let another player move to United in the future.\"I wouldn't take anyone there, they would even ruin Maradona, Pele and [Paolo] Maldini,\" Raiola is reported to have said. Ahead of United's match against Arsenal, former United defender Rio Ferdinand urged Pogba to speak out. Ferdinand told BT Sport: \"If I was someone sitting there advising Paul, I would say, 'Go and speak out. You're your own man. Your voice is going to be heard the loudest. Don't let your agent speak. Shut your agent down.'\"",

In the video of her sermon posted on the church's Facebook page, Court hit out at people who change their birth sex genders because \"God made us that way.\"\"You know, even that LGBT in the schools, it's the devil, it's not of God,\" the 77-year-old said. \"Children are making the decision at seven or eight years of age to change their sex, no, just read the first two chapters of Genesis, that's all I say.

Her comments come just weeks before she is set to be recognized at the Australian Open to celebrate the 50th anniversary of her grand slam sweep.Despite inviting Court to celebrate her achievement, Tennis Australia said in November, 2019 it did not agree with her \"demeaning\" personal views.\"Publicly stated views of intolerance and demeaning language about others can have enormous impact, and are particularly hurtful and harmful to those who believe they are targeted,\" the governing body said in an open letter.Court in action at the Wimbledon Tennis Championships in 1973.READ: Serena Williams' smashed racket from the US Open sells for $20,910Australian handball athlete Hannah Mouncey criticized Court for contributing to the \"bullying, discrimination and disadvantage faced by trans kids.\"\"48% of a recent sample (of transgender children) reported having attempted suicide and it's not because they're trans, it's because of just how badly society treats them,\" the 2018 Victorian LGBT Sportsperson of the Year said on Twitter. \"Surely after everything else, some significant steps need to be taken to address this. Under no circumstances would this be remotely accepted if her comments were in regards to any other minority group in our society.\"Court's views prompted former rival Billie Jean King to call for the Australian's name to be stripped from Melbourne Park's Margaret Court Arena at last year's tournament.However, Tennis Australia said it would not \"rewrite history\".In her sermon, Court highlighted the difficulty of openly discussing her religious views.\"The devil gets in and the media and the political, the education, TV -- he wants to control a nation so he can affect people's minds and mouths,\" Court said.\"I can go on television and if I say, 'well, this is what the Bible says', well, it's like opening a can of worms.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos\"My goodness, you've let a torpedo off or something.

It vowed to build a new enclosure and said it hopes to have apes at the zoo in the future.'Indications' about the causeWhile the cause of fire has yet to be confirmed, local police said there are \"indications\" of what may have led to the blaze. Krefeld Police investigator Gerd Hoppmann told the media conference that witnesses had spotted sky lanterns \"flying close to the zoo and very low, so we can assume they fell on the ground in this area.\"The lanterns have been banned in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia since 2009 because they pose a fire hazard. Violators can be fined up to 1,000 euros ($1,121).Several people have told police they may have started the fire. Police are questioning them and attempting to verify their statements. \"We have opened an investigation commission.

        "content": "(CNN)As a memorable sporting decade draws to a close, we take stock of the men and women who've set the standard for others to follow, on and off the field.Here are our selections for the top 10 -- one for each year of the 2010s -- based on the brightest champions from sports which have global fan bases. 1. Usain Bolt: Track and field It is difficult to underestimate the impact that Usain Bolt had both on his chosen sport and in the capturing the imagination of the global sporting community in a manner last seen when Muhammad Ali was in his prime. He entered the decade as the undisputed fastest man on Earth, having completed the 100-200m sprint double at the 2008 Beijing Olympics before setting world records in the 100m (9.58 seconds) and 200m (19.19 seconds) the following year -- marks which still stand today.Read MoreIt was a tough act to follow, but the fastest man on the planet continued to dominate. At the 2012 Olympics in London and the 2016 Games in Rio Bolt repeated his sprint double triumph and anchored the Jamaican 4x100m relay team to gold.He retired after the 2017 world championships before flirting with a career in professional football.  Other track and field notables: Allyson Felix, who broke Bolt's medal record at the 2019 championships in Doha; Eliud Kipchoge, marathon runner extraordinaire and first man to run the distance in under two hours.Usain Bolt with his trademark celebration of a gold medal for Jamaica in the 4x100m relay at the 2016 Rio Olympics. It was his eighth and final Olympic gold medal.2. LeBron James: BasketballLeBron James is one of the greatest players in NBA history, mentioned in the same breath as Michael Jordan and still going strong at 35 with the Los Angeles Lakers.His decision in 2010 to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers and join the Miami Heat sent shockwaves through the game, personifying a new era of player power, but it bore fruit with consecutive NBA championship wins in 2012 and 2013 after a chastening defeat to the Dallas Mavericks in the Finals the year before.Returning as a hero to a faltering Cavaliers team in 2014, James transformed the fortunes of the franchise, leading them to Cleveland's first professional sports title in 52 years with their triumph in the 2015 Finals. Between the Heat and the Cavs, James appeared in eight consecutive NBA Finals -- a feat few players have ever accomplished.With a scoring average of close to 27 points per game throughout the decade while also averaging about 8 rebounds and assists, James has been remarkably consistent, often reserving his best form for the playoffs.  Outside of the NBA, James also led the US team to gold at the 2012 Olympics.  Other basketball notables: Kevin Durant, two-time NBA Finals MVP with Golden State and a two-time Olympic gold medalist; Diana Taurasi, the four-time Olympic gold medalist who set a WNBA all-time scoring record in 2017.LeBron James hoists the Larry O'Brien trophy after his Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Golden State Warriors to win the NBA Finals in 2016.3. Cristiano Ronaldo: Soccer A goal-scoring machine on the pitch and a social media colossus off it, Ronaldo's exploits made him the most talked-about sports star of the decade. And at 34, he shows no sign of slowing up.After spending the early part of his career on Alex Ferguson's successful Manchester United team, Ronaldo transferred to Real Madrid for a then-world record fee for the 2009-10 season.With Lionel Messi's Barcelona dominating Spanish and European football, Ronaldo had the incentive to spur Los Blancos to former glories -- and how.Scoring at the incredible rate of just over a goal per game, Ronaldo helped Real to two La Liga titles and an unrivaled run of success in the Champions League with four wins in five years from 2013 to 2018.   International success came as well for Ronaldo with Portugal's national team. They won the European Championship in 2016 and Nations League in 2019.Last season, Ronaldo joined Juventus and his goals were a factor again as the Turin giant won Serie A, leaving him with championship titles in England, Spain and Italy -- another record for a remarkable player.  Cristiano Ronaldo is still hungry for goals with his latest side Juventus, shown here celebrating after scoring against Ajax Amsterdam in the Champions League in 2019. 4. Lionel Messi: SoccerLike his archrival Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi's appetite for sporting success shows no sign of abating as the decade draws to a close.At 32, Messi won the Ballon d'Or as FIFA World Player of the Year for the sixth time earlier this month. There would be few who would bet against him claiming that honor yet again as he continues to weave his magic with Barcelona.A one-club man to the core, Messi has helped Barca to six La Liga titles in the decade as well as two Champions League crowns and five Copa del Rey successes.His statistics almost defy belief: 521 goals scored in the past 10 seasons, along with 191 assists. He's a deadly finisher as well as a prolific creator.Only international success with an Argentina team which has failed to live up to its potential has eluded the magical Messi, but his tally of 70 goals in 138 games for his country is still impressive.Other soccer notables: Marta, the Brazil woman's international who set a new mark for goals at a World Cup with her 17th at the 2019 tournament in France; Andres Iniesta, Messi's longtime teammate at Barcelona, who scored the winning goal in the 2010 World Cup final for Spain.Lionel Messi poses with his sixth Ballon d'Or before a La Liga game for Barcelona earlier this month. 5. Tiger Woods: Golf Other players like Rory McIlroy, Brooks Koepka and Jordan Spieth may have better records in majors since 2010. But the sheer impact of his return to winning ways over the past two years elevated Tiger Woods to another level of sporting superstardom.Bedeviled by well-chronicled personal problems at the start of the decade and by crippling injuries for much of it, Woods looked a spent force as he slumped outside the top 1,000 in the golf ranking and contemplated retirement.But with a remodeled swing and a new commitment to fitness, Woods stormed back with a vengeance in 2018, winning the Tour Championship at East Lake, his first PGA Tour success since 2013, when he won five times.It acted as a springboard for the ultimate comeback story, his stunning triumph in the US Masters earlier this year. It was his 15th major title and first since 2008. Celebrating his 44th birthday as the new decade begins, Woods has Jack Nicklaus' record of 18 majors firmly in his sights.Other golfing notables: McIlroy and Koepka, with four major titles apiece; Inbee Park, winner of seven women's majors since 2010 and an Olympic gold medal in Rio in 2016.Tiger Woods is ecstatic after winning the 2019 Masters at Augusta, his first major title since 2008. 6. Serena Williams: Tennis Serena Williams is statistically the greatest player in the history of tennis, winning 23 grand slam singles titles, 16 in doubles and four Olympic gold medals, including two at the 2012 London Olympics.The first part of her career saw Williams battle for dominance with her elder sister Venus. This decade has seen her repel the advances of a string of more youthful contenders and add 12 grand slam singles titles to her tally.She has also had to battle illness and injury and was bedridden for weeks after the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr. in September 2017. The last of her grand slam singles crowns, the Australian Open in 2017, came when she was several weeks pregnant and beat Venus in an emotional final.Since her return to the WTA Tour following childbirth, she has still punched above her weight, reaching four grand slam finals (but losing them all).It's not clear whether 38-year-old Serena can finally surpass the all-time record for slams she jointly holds with Australian Margaret Court. But her significance far exceeds her playing record, as she is an iconic figure on and off the court.Other tennis notables: Novak Djokovic, winner of 15 slams in the decade; Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, the three players still dominating the men's game well into their thirties.Serena Williams on her way to winning the 2017 Australian Open final. 7. Michael Phelps: SwimmingMichael Phelps is famous for winning eight gold medals in a single Olympics, Beijing 2008. But the 'Baltimore Bullet' did not rest on his laurels after this remarkable feat, which is unlikely to be beaten.The 2012 Games in London saw Phelps continue his gold glut for the all-conquering US swim team as he claimed four gold medals and two slivers, taking him past the  previous best total of 18 held by Russian gymnast Larisa Latynina and stretching the record to 22. Phelps announced his retirement after the Games, later revealing that he had been suffering from mental health problems and had even contemplated taking his own life.A return to swimming helped Phelps battle his demons. He found yet more glory at the Rio Olympics, where he won five golds, including a fourth straight in the 200m individual medley, plus a silver. That left him the most decorated Olympian of all time with 28 medals, 23 of them gold.Other swimming notables: Katie Ledecky, the US freestyle swimmer who has won five Olympic golds and 14 world championship golds between 2012 and 2019; Caeleb Dressel, winner of 13 gold medals for the US at the last two world championships.Michael Phelps on his way to yet another gold medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics.8. Simone Biles: GymnasticsSimone Biles is only 22 but has already set new standards in her sport. Fellow American gold medalist Mary Lou Retton described her as the \"greatest gymnast ever,\" and few experts would disagree. The first of Biles' 19 world championship gold medals came at the tender age of 16 back in 2013. Her dominance shows no sign of waning as she won five golds in the global championships in Stuttgart earlier this year.She will go into the Tokyo Olympics in 2012 looking to add to her tally of four golds from the Rio Olympics after which she took a break from competition. Like Phelps, she has also battled personal problems with great courage..Biles revealed after her Rio success that she has to take medication for ADHD and in 2018 was named as one of the gymnasts sexually abused by disgraced US team doctor Larry Nassar, who is serving a prison sentence of between 40 and 175 years.Japanese fans will be hoping Kohie Uchimara recovers from injury to compete in Tokyo. Uchimara was the male gymnast of the decade with successive all-round golds at the London and Rio Games and a string of world championship victories. Simone Biles has won no less than 19 world championship gold medals during her short career.9.  Lewis Hamilton: MotorsportThe first black driver to win a Formula One world championship, in 2008, Lewis Hamilton has won five world titles in the past six years with the help of his formidable Mercedes team.As hungry for victory as ever, the British ace has taken the checkered flag in F1 racing 84 times, seven short of the record of 91 wins by Michael Schumacher.He is also one short of Schumacher's record of seven F1 world crowns, having pulled ahead Juan Manuel Fangio this season in the all-time list.Hamilton's rivalry with Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, who claimed the first four F1 titles of the decade while with Red Bull, has undoubtedly provided the impetus for his continued success. With newcomers Charles Leclerc and Max Verstappen snapping at his heels, he cannot rest on his laurels.Other motorsport notables: Marc Marquez, totally dominant in MotoGP with six world championships since 2013; Sebastian Ogier, who won six straight world rally championships.  Lewis Hamilton capped his sixth F1 world title in 2019 with a stunning victory for Mercedes at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.10. Tom Brady: FootballSince 2010 Brady has led his New England Patriots to five Super Bowls, winning three, including the 2019 edition with a 13-3 victory over the Los Angeles Rams.The 42-year-old quarterback has won six Super Bowl rings, all with the Patriots, during his remarkable career. He also set a string of Super Bowl records, including becoming the oldest player (39) to be named MVP after the Pats' 34-28 overtime thriller against the Falcons in 2016.And Brady's remarkable consistency continues into the current season, helping the Patriots to the playoffs for the 11th straight year while passing Peyton Manning for the second-most touchdown passes in NFL history, six behind all-time leader Drew Brees of the New Orleans Saints.Tom Brady of the New England Patriots celebrates a 13-3 win over the Los Angeles Rams at Super Bowl LIII in Atlanta.Honorable mentionsOutside of our top 10, there were a host of other remarkable performers and performances. Boxer Floyd Mayweather remained undefeated in his eight fights in the decade, including wins over Manny Pacquiao and Saul Alvarez and a stoppage of MMA star Conor McGregor. Chris Froome won the Tour de France four times. Mikaela Shiffrin is closing fast on Lindsey Vonn's 82 World Cup skiing victories. And the equine stars of the decade were the unbeaten Frankel and Winx, the Group 1 record winner.",

        "content": "London (CNN)The United Kingdom left the European Union on January 31. The world has since been mercifully quiet on the matter, and you'd be forgiven for assuming Brexit was over.  Wishful thinking. The UK is not yet a month into its \"transition period\" with the EU, during which the country continues to play by EU rules while a future relationship is negotiated. That period ends on December 31. On Monday, the two sides will finally sit down to negotiate what that future relationship looks like. And if the published priorities from London and Brussels are anything to go by, it's going to be a bloodbath. While both want a free trade agreement and close alignment, they also believe that the other is trying to suddenly change the rules of engagement.There's a dark side to Boris Johnson's government and even his allies are fed up with it Ruptures between the EU and UK are nothing new in Brexit, but this time it's a little different. The clock is ticking faster, the political landscape has changed, and no one knows how much good will there is. Unless a major breakthrough or concession happens in the coming weeks, it's hard to see how this concludes any way other than the UK's transition period ending with no formal deal. Read MoreWhat does the UK want?On paper, the UK's goals are straightforward. It wants a free trade agreement with the EU similar to the one that Canada enjoys. The EU's deal with Canada is substantial. It removes the need for most (but not all) tariffs on goods traded between the two. However, it does very little on financial services, the most important sector in the British economy. It's worth remembering that the UK and EU currently trade with zero tariffs and close to zero tariff barriers, so whatever trade deal is reached is still ultimately a question of how much friction will exist, which is a highly unorthodox starting point in trade talks. This, however, is what the UK wants. Why? Because more than trade, what Prime Minister Boris Johnson really wants is to guarantee the UK's independence from Brussels. What Prime Minister Boris Johnson really wants is to guarantee the UK's independence from Brussels.Sticking pointsThis is where things could get nasty. The EU also wants a trade deal with the UK and is entirely happy with it being a Canada-style deal. Where the two sides really disagree is on the pre-conditions for any deal. And it's more of a political row than anything else. \"While there are clearly disagreements when it comes to the EU's preconditions for negotiating a trade deal -- particularly over fish, the role of the European Court of Justice, and the exact nature of the level playing field requirements -- when it comes to what the future economic partnership actually looks like, the EU and UK really aren't that far apart,\" says the Centre for European Reform's Samuel Lowe.The 541-page Withdrawal Agreement signed off last autumn was accompanied by a 31-page document known as the Political Declaration. In it, the two sides talk of their mutual desire for a comprehensive trade deal, close cooperation on standards ranging from environmental to workers' rights, and an acknowledgment that geography and history make the relationship unique. Both sides agreed this must be done in a way that respects the EU's internal priorities, while also respecting the UK's sovereignty.Which sounds awfully chummy, until you realize that those areas of sovereignty somewhat cut across the EU's priorities. And this means that before talks have even started, the familiar blame game between Brussels and London is in full force. \"Now we have both sides' formal starting positions in this next round of talks, we can see that there are a substantial number of basic incompatibilities,\" says Simon Usherwood, Professor in Politics at the University of Surrey. Fish bones of contentionLet's start with fish. Despite its relatively small economic importance in the grand scheme of things, there is a romantic idea of fishing communities that resonates with some European voters.In the UK, the argument goes something like, \"The EU's Common Fisheries Policy has wrecked our fishing industry.\" The same could be said in French fishing communities if the EU fails to reach an agreement on how much access French fishermen have to British waters. It matters very much to French fishermen because fish have an annoying habit of not respecting borders. And in elections, romantic arguments can become very powerful.  \"Fisheries is a big problem, as the EU want to keep much of the effect of the Common Fisheries Policy, if not the policy itself, while the UK want a much looser arrangement,\" says Usherwood. \"Given how much both sides have laid weight on what is actually an economically very small sector, this will make it all the more difficult to resolve.\"The second big sticking point is the so-called Level Playing Field. If it is to allow UK goods to continue to enter its market free of tariffs, the EU doesn't want Britain's departure from the Union to create a competitor on its doorstep that can deviate from EU standards on things like workers' rights, environmental protections and taxation in ways that make British firms more competitive.JUST WATCHEDBoris Johnson on Brexit: My job is to bring this country togetherReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBoris Johnson on Brexit: My job is to bring this country together 03:26The UK agrees, as per the Withdrawal Agreement, that this is the best outcome. However, it seems to think that the agreement to do so should be more of a gentlemen's agreement than something formally locked in place. Which, given the EU's obsession with rules, is freaking people out in Brussels. The UK rejects that any formal oversight is needed. The EU believes that this can only be achieved with \"sufficient guarantees for a level playing field so as to uphold corresponding high levels of protection over time\" in areas ranging from state aid to competition law. If you're sitting in Brussels, the UK is breaking away from what it knew was going to have to be a formal agreement. If you're in Downing Street, the EU is suddenly trying to squeeze you on a trade deal and force the UK to hand over some of its independence. As things stand, neither side's position is acceptable to the other. There are numerous other areas of disagreement, from the role that EU courts will play in the UK's legal system (the UK says none, the EU says some) and cooperation on Europe's security policy. A delicate power balanceAs difficult as this all seems, there are two ways of looking at it. On the one hand, these red lines can't be moved and we will never get trade talks. On the other, it shows where both sides have room to negotiate. And looking at it from London, Johnson's domestic position is arguably securer than his political counterparts in France, Germany, Italy and Dublin. Which gives him political capital at home. And political stability matters when it comes to talking to Europe. The fact that Johnson has a parliamentary majority of more than 80, whatever he decides means that Brussels is negotiating with a man who will follow through on his words. This could mean that he powers ahead with a hard Brexit, sure. But there is also a world in which Johnson moves closer to Brussels and uses his personal charm to sell a deal to Brexiteers. After all, he managed to shove what was in large part Theresa May's Brexit deal down their throats last year, lubricated with sufficient champagne that they couldn't help but swallow. The EU is facing a serious crisis. It's funding the same people who wish to wreck itWhile EU officials accept that Johnson's strength at home also gives him power at the negotiating table, they remain confident that the power of 27 versus one and the potential for no deal doing untold havoc to the British economy means Johnson will use his domestic power to take the less risky option and move closer to Europe. But that assumes Johnson actually wants to move this time around. Last autumn, Johnson was working to alter a deal agreed by his predecessor that in some respects bought him time to negotiate a harder Brexit, if that's what he wanted. The trouble is, no one really knows what he wants. Is this all a strategy of brinksmanship in the hopes Brussels will blink? Or does Johnson really value sovereignty over potential economic turmoil? \"As so often, this looks like an exercise in making it up as you go along, without a clear strategic objective in mind, let alone a cunning plan,\" says Usherwood. Which all makes for an exciting political story. It's just a shame that one man's gamble speaks for a nation of more than 66 million people.",

He's helped nurture the likes of Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andrew Robertson -- who have both redefined their full-back roles over the last two seasons.Even midfielders such as Georginio Wijnaldum and captain Jordan Henderson have found another gear since working under the German, according to Mido. \"What Klopp has done there is unbelievable. Developing young players and developing some signings shows you the quality of the coach,\" he added.Mido, now 37, made a big impact during his days in the English Premier League where he played for the likes of Tottenham Hotspur.He also made 51 appearances for the Egyptian national team and keeps a keen eye on the country's current star Mohamed Salah. The 27-year-old has arguably been the biggest influence on Liverpool's recent success and is enjoying yet another goal happy season -- netting 15 times in the league this season. READ: How the coronavirus is impacting sportMohamed Salah is the best Egyptian player in history, says MidoEgyptian King Despite already being an impressive prospect when joining from Roma in 2017, no one could have expected the form he's shown since.\"When he came from Roma, he was more of a flank player, a proper winger. He wasn't scoring as many goals as he's doing now and Klopp has been very clever,\" Mido said. \"He tucked him in a little bit as a second striker and it made him closer to the goal. With his pace, with his quality, he is scoring more goals and I think it all goes back to Jurgen Klopp.\" Salah has enjoyed similar performances for his national side and helped fire Egypt into the 2018 World Cup -- the country's first tournament in 28 years. The trophies he's won and his performances on the pitch is enough for Mido to call him the best player ever produced by Egypt. \"We've had some very good players but to play at the top level for so many years, to keep focused, to keep performing with the top performances week in week out, I don't think any other Egyptian player has done it,\" he admits.

However, despite all the talent in the club, Mido thinks Liverpool will fall short of matching Arsenal's Invincibles in the 2003-2004 season, which went the whole domestic season without losing a game.The Egyptian says the distraction of the Champions League and the fact the Premier League title could be wrapped up next month, will likely result in defeats. \"I think their concern is to win the Premier League, I don't think they really care if they get beat,\" Mido said. \"If they win the league early, they will lose some games at the end because I'm sure they will still be in the Champions League.\"Once Liverpool win the Premier League he [Klopp] will start his rotation and he will start to rest some players.\" Liverpool face Watford in the Premier League on Saturday before facing Chelsea in the fifth round of the FA Cup on March 3. The Reds will also have one eye on overturning the 1-0 deficit from the first-leg of its Champions League round of 16 tie against Atletico Madrid.

Oh wait. Here's the catch: The bed is in the bathroom. Yes, if you were to roll out of bed you'd find yourself almost smacking into either the toilet or the basin.And the asking price? \u00a31,500 (US$1,940) per month for the 27-square-meter flat, according to estate agent Foxtons. CNN contacted the company -- one of London's leading realtors -- but it declined to comment on the price or how much interest the ad had generated.The bed located inside the bathroom of a Camden flat.What's most shocking, though, is that such a sizable price tag for a less-than-ideal living arrangement is by no means out of the ordinary in London's rental market.Read MoreExperts say the British capital is experiencing a housing crisis. A shortage of affordable homes is pricing people out, impacting Londoners' mental health, and -- in extreme cases -- driving up homelessness.As in many major cities around the world, London is feeling the strain of changing demographics. Young people are moving into urban areas rather than out to suburbs, there's an aging population to house, and an increase in single residents, according to analysts.Meanwhile, wages haven't kept up with rent increases, and the price of land for building new homes has leapt. All of which has created a \"perfect storm,\" said Paul Hackett, director of London think tank the Smith Institute, whose research includes housing policy in both the UK and Europe. The floor plan of a 27 square meter flat advertised in Camden, London, shows the sleeping area in the washroom.  Elsewhere in Europe, Berlin renters are also feeling the squeeze. But in stark contrast to London, the German capital has implemented a drastic new measure to halt skyrocketing prices. 'We don't want to end up like London'This week, Berlin became the first city in Germany to freeze rent prices for the next five years. The price cap will affect around 1.5 million rented homes -- 90% of all rental households in the capital, Berlin's Department for Urban Development and Housing told CNN. The cap doesn't apply to social housing or homes built from 2014 onwards. Unlike London, where 62% of people own their own homes, Berlin has long been a city of renters. Its large, empty buildings and traditionally cheap prices have long attracted arty types from across the continent. It's not unusual for a Berlin family to live their entire lives in a rented home. But in recent years the city has faced rapid price hikes, prompting mass protests from angry tenants. While the rent freeze is a win for activists, it was opposed by many in the real estate industry and Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrat party, who warned it would likely deter urgently-needed construction work and modernization. Some German politicians are adamant about what kind of city they don't want Berlin to turn into. \"We don't want to end up like London,\" finance minister Olaf Scholz told local media as he threw his support behind the proposed rent freeze last year.Scholz described the horror of a British capital \"where even lawyers and doctors have to live with flatmates, because they can't afford their own apartment.\"      Just over a quarter of Londoners -- around 2.4 million people -- rent privately. And they're spending an average 37% of their income doing so, a spokesman from the Mayor of London's office told CNN. The knock-on effects of paying \"ridiculous amounts of money\" on rent mean that in some cases, \"people are not having children,\" said Hackett. They're \"getting stressed,\" have \"less time to spend with their loved ones,\" and \"less money available to go on holidays.\"At the more extreme end of the problem, there is the prospect of \"homelessness, overcrowding, and council-run temporary accommodation,\" he added.Rent controls in London?So could a Berlin-style price cap happen in London? The city's Labour Mayor, Sadiq Khan, seems to think so in his blueprint for reforming the rental sector.However, it's unlikely to become a reality any time soon, as the Mayor of London does not have statutory powers to implement such a cap. That's decided by the national government, currently Boris Johnson's Conservatives, which largely rejects rent controls on the basis that they deter investors.It's a view shared by Britain's National Landlord Association. \"Rent controls don't work,\" said spokeswoman Meera Chindooroy. \"Because landlords are disincentivized to invest in the market.\"She added that under rent controls, landlords might not have the money available to improve their properties. There is also the risk of a \"gray market\" -- landlords finding ways to get around the rent controls -- Chindooroy said.     But this argument doesn't wash with Dan Williams Craw, director of campaign group Generation Rent. \"Landlords have a legal requirement to keep properties to a certain standard, and that wouldn't change under a rent control system,\" he said.He added that currently landlords may actually \"evade their responsibilities\" to fix up properties, because if a tenant asks for improvements the owner \"can turn around and say: 'If I do that, your rent is going up.'\" Craw said.Since the 2016 Brexit referendum, skyrocketing rental prices in London have cooled, largely due to falling demand from EU migrants, said the NLA's Chindooroy.But that doesn't necessarily mean prices will keep going down, said campaigner Craw. He questioned whether tighter immigration rules could impact construction workers coming to London from European countries -- currently more than a quarter of the workforce.Paying for a 'massive junkyard' As plenty of people house hunting in London recently will tell you, it can be a disheartening experience.Almost a quarter of privately rented homes in the British capital fail the Government's Decent Home Standard, according to the Greater London Authority (GLA). The GLA said housing laws were not being adequately enforced by local councils, with thousands of homes plagued by exposed wiring, broken boilers and black mold.It's a grim scene that 35-year-old freelance photographer, Maja Smiejkowska, knows well. She moved to London from Poland 10 years ago, and has rented rooms in various shared houses in southeast London.Negative interest rates are inflating real estate prices. These cities are at risk of a bubbleAfter living in her last place for five years, she said she knew it was time to move when the landlord refused to address a rodent problem, black mold in the bathroom, and a broken oven. The last straw came when he announced plans to subdivide the house, creating two new bedrooms to shoehorn in additional tenants.Smiejkowska said she already spends around 40% of her income on rent, and simply can't afford to live by herself.During her three-month house hunt, she came across places where eight people were living in five-bedroom homes, houses with no living room, walls \"almost black from dirt\" and the landlord's possessions in every room.\"The whole garden was a massive junkyard for his belongings,\" she said of one house. \"I would have been paying \u00a3600 ($780) a month for his storage.\" Eventually Smiejkowska found a suitable five-bedroom sharehouse in the borough of Lewisham. But she doesn't see herself living in London forever, given that she is unlikely ever to be able to afford a place of her own.Among the cities Smiejkowska is considering moving to is -- you've guessed it -- Berlin.\"The rent is more affordable compared to what you're earning,\" she said, despite calling London \"home\" for a decade.",

But he also made a distinction between the two awards Polanski's film earned.The minister told public broadcaster France Info that \"An Officer and a Spy\" could receive the award for best movie as it was a \"collective work.\" However, Polanski winning the gong for best director would \"send a negative message.\"Actress Ad\u00e8le Haenel (right) leaves the award ceremony after Roman Polanski wins the award for best director.But actress Fanny Ardant, who received the Cesar for best supporting actress for her role in \"La Belle \u00c9poque,\" came to the defense of Polanski. She told reporters shortly after winning, \"When I love someone, I love them passionately. And I love Roman Polanski a lot ... a lot ... So I'm very happy for him. Then, I understand that not everyone agrees but long live freedom!\"Veteran French film actress Brigitte Bardot also defended Polanski in a hand-written message posted on Twitter: \"Thankfully Polanski exists and he is saving cinema from its mediocrity! I judge him on his talent and not on his private life! I regret never having shot with him!\"Deeply controversial choicePolanski turned down CNN's request for an interview, but said in a statement that he couldn't attend the C\u00e9sar awards ceremony because he didn't want to \"face a self-proclaimed court of opinion ready to trample on the principles of the rule of law so that the irrational can once again triumph unchallenged.\"\"We already know how the evening will unfold.

It tells the true story of a French army captain, Alfred Dreyfus, a Jew, who was falsely accused -- and convicted -- of treason in 1894. It is considered one of the most infamous wrongful convictions in French history and Dreyfus was eventually exonerated.The movie has done well at the box office, despite the controversy, with more than 1.6 million tickets sold, according to the latest figures from the French National Cinema Center.",

        "content": "(CNN)Researchers have discovered a new type of lion, the size of a domestic cat, with powerful flesh-cutting teeth, which roamed the earth around 24 million years ago. Paleontologists discovered the remains of the creature at Australia's Riversleigh World Heritage Area in Queensland, where experts have been excavating fossils by dissolving limestone rock deposits with acid for more than 40 years. Researchers from the University of New South Wales uncovered a partial mammal's skull, and initially presumed that it belonged to the Priscileo Rauscher genus of marsupial lion because of its teeth and size. 'Missing link' penguin fossil shows how they evolved after dinosaurs went extinctMarsupial lions died out 35,000 years ago and varied in size, with some as big as a modern-day African lioness, Michael Archer, professor of biological, earth and environmental science at the University of New South Wales, told CNN.  Experts studied the mammal's skull and lower jaw, and noticed the animal's skull anatomy was different than what they had previously encountered in other marsupial lions. Read More\"As we found more and better specimens at Riversleigh, we began to realize it didn't belong to that group at all. It was a new kind of marsupial that hadn't been seen before,\" Archer, who worked alongside lead author Anna Gillespie and Suzanne Hand, told CNN. \"It was a different branch on the marsupial lion family tree,\" he said. It was only by studying the creature that researchers realised how \"significantly different\" the animal, named Lekaneleo, was. In a paper published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, researchers confirmed that the mammal was a new genus of the marsupial lion.Lekaneleo would have been the \"size of a pussycat,\" Archer said, but had \"probably the most powerful flesh-cutting teeth that we've ever seen.\"Turns out there are actually two species of red panda, not just one\"Lekaneleo had teeth in it that are a bit like micro bolt-cutting teeth; there is nothing this animal decided to eat that it couldn't have cut into bite-size, swallowable pieces almost immediately,\" Archer said.Marsupials are a group of animals commonly known as \"pouched mammals,\" endemic to Australasia and the Americas. Koalas, kangaroos, wallabies and wombats belong to the group, which is characterized by premature birth followed by feeding the newborn from the mother's nipples.Experts believe that Lekaneleo lived in trees, surviving on creatures including birds, snakes, possums -- and even animals the size of sheep. Although they are named \"lions,\" researchers said the animals were more closely related to kangaroos and koalas.Experts say that in understanding the demise of now-extinct creatures like the marsupial lion, we will have a better understanding of how climate change will affect modern-day animals. \"These are such different kinds of carnivorous mammals that they were occupying an ecological niche that nothing today is similar to,\" Archer told CNN. \"In a sense, it tells us how we have lost many distinctive specialized kinds of animals over time. And this is the result of climate change,\" he said. \"We see many of these very strange groups that don't have any living representatives, slowly disappearing. Understanding this whole relationship between environmental change and biodiversity is very important in understanding and anticipating what's going to happen now,\" he said.",

The group is openly, and vocally, anti-migrant, anti-Roma, anti-LGBTQ, anti-Israel, anti-European Union and anti-NATO.But its extremism goes well beyond that. Kotlebovci proudly celebrate the legacy of the Slovak State, the 1939-1945 fascist client state of Nazi Germany. They praise its president, Jozef Tiso, a man who was convicted of being personally responsible for approving the deportations of tens of thousands of Jews to German concentration camps.Dozens of gravestones vandalized in Jewish cemetery in Slovakia\"Their manifesto doesn't necessarily refer to neo-Nazi ideas, but they have neo-Nazis in their ranks,\" said Gabriel E\u0161tok, a fellow at the Department of Political Science at the University of Pavel Jozef \u0160af\u00e1rik in Ko\u0161ice. \"There are people on their lists of candidates who have swastika tattoos, who have used anti-Semitic rhetoric, anti-Roma rhetoric, and who have denied Holocaust,\" he added.Read MoreKotleba and the party did not respond to CNN's several requests for interviews and comments. He has in the past denied having extremist views, in news interviews as well as during his court appearances.Despite Kotlebovci's neo-Nazi connections, an increasing number of Slovak voters are finding the party appealing, or at least more appealing than the country's political establishment.\"Many people who are voting for Kotleba, they are not voting for him because they truly believe he will solve all their problems, they know that the party is pretty useless,\" said Michal Va\u0161e\u010dka, sociologist and the director of Bratislava Policy Institute. \"They are voting for him to spite someone, they are voting against 'the system.'\"Marian Kotleba pictured here in 2006 attending an event near the village of Brezova pod Bradlom, Slovakia. The divisions in Slovakia largely copy those seen elsewhere in Europe and the United States. Rural, poorer and less educated voters are being pitted against the \"urban elite.\" Kotleba is tapping into that sentiment.\"If you go to rural east Slovakia, people there will tell you in your face 'we will vote for Kotleba to annoy you Bratislava people,'\" Va\u0161e\u010dka said.Like in many other European countries. Slovakia's established social democratic parties are struggling to appeal to their traditional electorate. \"The people who lost out from the transformation [from Communism] after the 1989 revolution, who were less successful, less educated, these parties don't seem to be representing them,\" said Tom\u00e1\u0161 Nociar, a lecturer at the Department of Political Science at the Comenius University in Bratislava.The problem he says is, the liberal, more right-wing parties can't reach these voters either as they are also seen as part of the establishment. \"So they turn to parties like Kotleba's,\" Nociar added.Central European countries to skip migration summit as EU tries to work out refugee issue Kotlebovci's first big success came in 2013, when Kotleba unexpectedly became the governor of the Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica region. It was a seismic shift in European politics.A tall man with balding head and a distinctive mustache, Kotleba first became a household name as the leader of the neo-Nazi group Slovak Brotherhood. The movement was banned by Slovakia's highest court in 2006 for being anti-constitutional.Kotleba rebranded and his current party became a more polished, suited-up version of the original movement. In his regional campaign, he promised to \"restore order\" and stop \"Gypsy criminals.\"His popularity appears to be rising despite the fact that he is currently standing trial over accusations that he used Nazi symbols, a crime in Slovakia. He denies the charges.Marek Balaz, human rights monitoring coordinator at the European Roma Rights Centre, said Kotleba both taps into and amplifies the country's racism problem.According to findings by the European Commission, the Roma minority is facing persistent discrimination in Slovakia, with many people living in absolute poverty in socially excluded communities and with limited access to public services.\"There is a problem, and the majority in the society sees it and sees that something needs to be done, but the solutions are complex and long-term, and need to be based on evidence, not emotions,\" Balaz said. \"But people want to solve the problems immediately,\" he added.Kotlebovci's manifesto is scarce on details, but heavy on anti-Roma rhetoric. It is promising to \"put a stop to the preferential treatment of all social parasites, including gypsy parasites.\" In recent years Kotleba has shocked the more liberal parts of the country. His party went from gaining less than 1.6% of the votes in the 2012 general election, to just over 8% in 2016.\"Slovak society initially did not react to this and didn't take it seriously. Because the intellectual potential of many of the party's members is very, very low, many people were making fun of them ... and then 2016 came, and they got 8%,\" Va\u0161e\u010dka said.Nociar said that branding Kotlebovci as just another far-right European group, like Germany's AfD or Italy's League, would be misleading. \"This party is much more extreme. The Western European parties, they still operate within the democratic framework. Kotleba is not,\" he said. Slovaks take to streets as PM's resignation fails to stifle anger\"They are copying all of the messaging used by fascists, take any book about fascism and you'll find exactly the same rhetoric,\" Va\u0161e\u010dka said. \"They claim the nation is in danger and that their party can save it from the moral decadence that is coming from the West, and lead the nation towards a renewal.\"Despite their recent rise in the polls, Kotlebovci's chances of getting into government appear limited, as all other parties categorically refuse the idea of working with them. But even if they are shut out, they will emerge from the election stronger. That's because under Slovak laws, political parties that gain more than 3% in the election are entitled to a state subsidy. \"He will get more money and he will be able to spread the rhetoric further, he'll have more money to spend on his campaigning,\" Balaz said. Balaz added, however, that there is one -- not insignificant -- upside to Kotleba's rise. \"Roma people in Slovakia are mobilizing, they are coming to Kotleba's meetings and they are staging peaceful protests against him,\" he said.\"They are showing that this is too much and they are finding out that they too can participate in democracy, through the protests, but also by voting in the election.\"",

Sun won a gold medal in the 200m freestyle at the 2019 World Aquatic Championships in South Korea, but British swimmer Duncan Scott, who won joint-bronze, refused to shake hands or pose for pictures with the Chinese swimmer -- only two days after Australian swimmer Mack Horton chose not to share the podium with Sun.Before the 400m freestyle race at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Horton had labeled Sun a \"drug cheat.\"In a statement, Scott said he supported the ruling handed down by CAS.\"I fully respect and support the decision that has been made and announced by the Court of Arbitration for Sport this morning,\" he said. \"I believe in clean sport and a level playing field for all athletes and I trust in CAS and WADA to uphold these values.\"The 28-year-old won 200m freestyle gold at Rio 2016.'Snowball effect'Olympic champion Chad le Clos told CNN that he believed he \"deserved\" the gold medal he was denied after finishing second behind Sun in the 200m freestyle in 2016. \"It's obviously not for me to judge but of course, I believe that I deserve that gold medal because back in 2016, it was actually a personal best and actually a South African record,\" Le Clos told CNN Sport's Amanda Davies. \"I feel like it's not only about me.

        "content": "(CNN)It was Maria Sharapova's mental toughness which set her apart from most of her peers. There may have been others with more talent, players who moved more elegantly on the court, yet few could match her spirit. She was the ultimate competitor. But, aged 32, one of the best-known athletes of the century had to call time on a brilliant career. She was no longer the best in the world and, more significantly, she could no longer endure the pain which has been a constant companion, in the last two years especially. Five-time grand slam winner Maria Sharapova retires from tennisThe injuries, of which there had been many since she first burst into public consciousness by winning Wimbledon as a 17-year-old, had taken their toll. The realization that she could not continue with the daily grind came at last year's US Open, Sharapova said, when 30 minutes before a match she needed to numb the pain in a shoulder where the tendons had become \"frayed like a string.\"\"Just stepping onto the court that day felt like a final victory, when of course it should have been merely the first step towards victory,\" she wrote in announcing her retirement, perhaps appropriately considering how often she has featured in fashion magazines, in Vogue and Vanity Fair.  \"I share this not to garner pity, but to paint my new reality: My body had become a distraction.\"Read MoreHer retirement came as no surprise. The writing was on the wall at the Australian Open in January when she suffered a third consecutive first-round defeat in a grand slam. But one of the game's greatest fighters would not want to be viewed as having thrown in the towel. She was, she said, saying goodbye. Sharapova speaks at a press conference in downtown LA to announce she had failed a doping test at the Australian Open.Sharapova leaves tennis ranked 373 in the world and her reputation tarnished. The 15-month suspension she served for testing positive in 2016 for meldonium -- a heart disease drug which had been legal until January 1 that year -- dominated the final years of her career.  Initially banned for two years, Sharapova argued on appeal that it had been an administrative error and that the punishment was \"unfairly harsh,\" and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) concluded that it would be wrong to call the player an \"intentional doper.\" But since returning to the sport in 2017, Sharapova had failed to find the old magic. Though her final career singles title came at the Tianjin Open in October 2017, she never broke into the top 20 since returning from suspension. She talked of adding to the five grand slam titles she had already won, but the injuries -- to the thigh, the left arm and, significantly, the career-long shoulder problem -- ruined any hopes she had of challenging the best in the women's game. Sharapova had battled back from injury before, significantly a career-threatening shoulder injury sustained in 2008. Then she talked of feeling as if her arm was \"going to fall off\" during recuperation but went on to complete a career grand slam in 2012, becoming only the 10th woman to do so, and secured Olympic silver in London. The French Open wins, in 2012 and 2014, on a surface which she once described herself as resembling a \"cow on ice,\" was particularly impressive.Had the injuries not been so severe maybe the Russian would have achieved even more. There will always be what ifs, just as the suspension for testing positive for Meldonium at the Australian Open will forever accompany any mention of her legacy. Yet Sharapova will be also be remembered for her achievements on the court and the remarkable story of how her parents, Yuri and Yelena, gambled everything on their only child making it.

By the age of 11 she had signed with Nike and within 10 years had won three grand slams. It was Sharapova's mental toughness which caught people's attention. \"Her mind was just unbelievable,\" Bollettieri once said of his former pupil. \"It was never in her mind to be a failure.\"The grit has often been overlooked because of the glamor, which also helped transform the once ungainly child who was born in Siberia into a global star. Her achievements are significant: 36 titles, the first Russian woman to reach the top of the WTA rankings, the third-youngest woman to win the Wimbledon singles title.She ends her career with nearly $39 million in prize money and millions earned from endorsements and various business enterprises, too.

There was no tribute from Williams on social media on Wednesday. Indeed, few of her peers have commented on her retirement.

No one opposed the bill.She had no sanitary pads.

The survey also found that nearly half of all girls aged 14 to 21 are embarrassed by their periods, while about half had missed an entire day of school because of them.\"For some reason, period products are regarded by some as a luxury, a luxury for which women should be charged,\" Alison Johnstone, a member of parliament, said during debate. \"Why is it in 2020 that toilet paper is seen as a necessity but period products aren't?\"The Scottish government has made other efforts to tackle period poverty in the last few years. In 2018, the government announced that students in schools, colleges and universities across the countries would be able to access sanitary products for free, through a \u00a35.2 million investment.

        "content": "Rome (CNN)Two Americans charged with aggravated murder and extortion in the stabbing death of an Italian police officer last July went on trial Wednesday in Rome, claiming self-defense.Finnegan Elder, now 20, and Gabriel Natale Hjorth, now 19, say Italian paramilitary officer Mario Cerciello Rega and his partner threw the first punches in a 32-second scuffle that ended in Rega's death July 26. Both officers were working in plainclothes. US teen accused of killing Italian police officer says media has 'misrepresented' his caseThe presiding judge, Maria Sabina Calabretta, heard from scores of legal representatives in the hourslong trial to determine what evidence would be introduced. In Italy, criminal trials allow civil parties to participate, meaning they can offer evidence and cross-examine suspects and other witnesses. Among those Calabretta allowed as civil plaintiffs for the upcoming trial is the widow of the officer, Rosa Maria Rega, who will be allowed to defend her dead husband's honor, which has been called into question over the handling of the attempted arrest of the Americans. Calabretta also allowed Italy's defense and interior ministries to participate because Rega, 35, was part of the paramilitary police force.Read MoreGabriel Natale Hjorth attends the opening of the trial in Rome on Wednesday.Elder has confessed to stabbing Rega in what he now says was self-defense after a drug deal set up by interloper Sergio Brugiatelli went wrong. He and Natale Hjorth say they were sold crushed aspirin for $80 instead of a gram of cocaine in the Trastevere district of Rome, and when they found out they had been duped, they went back to steal Brugiatelli's bag.Italian officer allegedly killed by American teens was stabbed with knife brought from US, say policeBrugiatelli called police to report his stolen bag. They first told him to go to a police station, but then he called his phone still inside the bag, and the Americans allegedly demanded money and real cocaine for its return. After Brugiatelli called the police again, Rega and his partner, Andrea Varriale, intervened on his behalf and met the Americans.Brugiatelli was also admitted as a civil plaintiff in the trial.The Americans say that when they arrived at the rendezvous point to exchange the bag for cash and cocaine, Rega and Varriale did not identify themselves and instead jumped them \"mob-like,\" according to attorney Craig Peters.Varriale, the only material witness, says they did, but that the Americans attacked first.Leah and Ethan Elder, parents of American student Finnegan Lee Elder, attend the opening of their son's trial in Rome on Wednesday.Rega, who weighed about 100 pounds more than Elder, bled to death from 11 wounds on his sides and back made by Elder's 7-inch military-grade knife. Elder's defense team argues that there would be wounds on the Rega's chest had Elder attacked first.Natale Hjorth claims he did not know his friend was carrying the knife. It was later found in the ceiling tile of the hotel room they shared the night before the murder.After the attack, Varriale called for help but the ambulance took 15 minutes to arrive. Rega later died in hospital. His official cause of death is blood loss. The Americans' defense teams argue that had the ambulance been timelier, he would have survived.Varriale, who was also in court Wednesday, is under administrative leave from the force for lying to his superiors about having his weapon. He originally told supervisors that while Rega forgot his weapon that day, he had his. He also initially told investigators that the two attackers were North Africans. Varriale's superior, Cmdr. Sandro Ottaviani, is on administrative leave for lying to his own supervisors when he told them that Varriale gave him his service weapon at the hospital after the stabbing.Police later confirmed that neither Rega nor Varriale had weapons or handcuffs and that Rega did not have his badge on him when they met the Americans. The officers also did not update their location with their central command, and did not have a car or backup even though it was a drug-related call, according to police documents related to the case and obtained by CNN.Two other police officers, Fabio Manganaro and Silvio Pellegrini, are on administrative leave for blindfolding Natale Hjorth during his initial interrogation, taking a photo of the act and leaking it to the media.Blindfolding US teen accused of killing officer 'unacceptable,' says prosecutor -- but interrogation is still validElder's attorneys asked for a technical expert to examine and retranslate surveillance tapes taken on three dates in August and September as Elder, his lawyer and parents met in a private visitors room in the prison in Rome. The tapes were translated into Italian and leaked to the media, and indicated Elder told his lawyer and family that he knew Rega was a police officer. Elder's defense team argues the translation was inaccurate and that he said he did not know Rega was an officer.Natale Hjorth's defense asked for the video of him blindfolded while in custody and other material surrounding that event.Peters, Elder's American lawyer, issued a statement on behalf of his parents, Leah and Ethan Elder, after the hearing. \"We are grateful that this process is finally moving forward and we hope that this trial can stay focused on the facts of what happened that night. We look forward to the truth coming out, and to Finn coming home.\"The next hearing is scheduled for March 9.",

        "content": "(CNN)Saudi Arabia is launching a soccer league for women, another gesture toward loosening some of the strict rules that are still imposed on women living in the ultra-conservative kingdom.Until recently, Saudi women were mostly barred from participating in sports in public. But the country has been under pressure from various sports governing organizations to allow women to take part in international events. When Saudi Arabia agreed to send its first female athletes to the Olympics in 2012, it was the last country to submit to the pressure from the International Olympic Committee for more gender equality.Saudi Arabian women finally allowed to hold passports and travel independentlyThe new soccer league could be another step in that direction.\"The commencement of the Saudi Women's Football League is one more major leap forward for the future of our country, our health, our youth, and our ambitions to see every athlete be recognized and nurtured to their fullest capability,\" Prince Khaled bin Alwaleed bin Talal Al Saud, the president of the Saudi Sports for All Federation (SFA), said in a statement on Monday.Read MoreSaudi Arabia has never had a national soccer team compete in the women's World Cup, though a women's team represented the Kingdom in a regional futsal competition last year. One of the reasons why the kingdom resisted calls for women to be allowed to compete internationally was a ban on hijab that was imposed by football's governing body FIFA in 2007. However, that ban was lifted in 2012. The new league is not part of Saudi Arabia's national football federation, which includes many leagues and youth programs for men and boys. According to the SFA statement, the women's league will consist of preliminary rounds that will determine regional champions, who will then proceed to a knockout stage and compete for the WFL Champions Cup. The SFA added the total prize money was set at 500,000 Saudi riyal ($133,251).Most of the games in the inaugural season will take place in Riyadh, Jeddah and Damman, but the SFA said there is \"potential for more depending on registrations.\"Saudi Arabia and Iran share a mutual disdain for women who speak upMen still have 'arbitrary authority' over their female relativesThe launch of the women's league is the latest in a series of measures the kingdom says were taken to empower women as it flirts with equality. In December last year, the government ended gender segregation at restaurants. In August, a ban was lifted on Saudi women holding passports and traveling abroad without the consent of a male guardian. In a landmark reform, women were granted the right to drive in 2017 and were issued their first drivers' licenses in 2018. However, many harsh restrictions remain in place, and the kingdom has also escalated a drive to stamp out dissent in recent years. The United Nations has warned that much more needs to be done to grant women full autonomy. \"Women continue to face numerous restrictions under the guardianship system, which gives men arbitrary authority over their female relatives and is based on, and results in, discrimination against women,\" a panel of UN experts said in a statement after the reforms were announced last year. Landmark day for Saudi women as kingdom's controversial driving ban endsWomen still need the permission of a male guardian to get married or divorced, open a business, or sometimes even access health care. In cases where a woman's father is deceased or absent, her husband, a male relative, brother, or in some cases, even a son, must give his approval before she can obtain basic entitlements.Women also have little authority over their own life -- a Saudi woman's legal position is equal to that of a minor, and their testimony in court are given less weight than those of men.The UN experts said that despite the relaxation of some of the rules, the system in place still \"negates [women's] fundamental human rights and their dignity as autonomous human beings,\" and \"severely impairs women's equal participation and decision-making in political, economic and social affairs\".",

View this post on Instagram           Tennis showed me the world\u2014and it showed me what I was made of. It's how I tested myself and how I measured my growth. And so in whatever I might choose for my next chapter, my next mountain, I'll still be pushing. I'll still be climbing. I'll still be growing. Tennis\u2014I'm saying goodbye. A post shared by  Maria Sharapova (@mariasharapova) on Feb 26, 2020 at 5:19am PST \"Looking back now, I realize that tennis has been my mountain,\" she said. \"My path has been filled with valleys and detours, but the views from its peak were incredible. \"After 28 years and five Grand Slam titles, though, I'm ready to scale another mountain\u2014to compete on a different type of terrain.\"She spent five different stints at the top of the world rankings, as well as receiving a number of high-paid endorsements from brands such as Nike. After returning to the top in 2012, Sharapova made her Olympic debut in London where she finished with the silver medal, losing in the final to Williams. Off the court, Sharapova was busy building a business empire, creating a candy production company -- Sugarpova -- as well as being co-owner of Supergoop, a sunscreen company. Injuries eventually took their toll on the Russian, though. She suffered a number of shoulder injuries, and before last year's US Open, she recognized the end of her career might be near. \"Behind closed doors, thirty minutes before taking the court, I had a procedure to numb my shoulder to get through the match,\" Sharapova, now ranked 373 in the world, wrote in her farewell article. \"Shoulder injuries are nothing new for me -- over time my tendons have frayed like a string. \"I've had multiple surgeries -- once in 2008; another procedure last year -- and spent countless months in physical therapy. Just stepping onto the court that day felt like a final victory, when of course it should have been merely the first step toward victory. I share this not to garner pity, but to paint my new reality: My body had become a distraction.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos'Big champion'Sharapova serves against Vekic at the Australian Open.\"Throughout my career, Is it worth it? was never even a question -- in the end, it always was.

Of course she wanted probably bigger success than she really paid or her body allowed her to have.\"It was pleasure to be with her on the tour, sharing the court with her. It was always great battles when we play together. So it's been always nice to share the court with her and I do always have respect to her.\"",

Read MoreAssange personally warned: \"I don't understand why you're not seeing the urgency in this... people's lives are at risk,\" according to Summers.But he was told to call back in a few hours, said the lawyer.CNN reached out to the State Department for a response, but had not received one at time of publishing. Extradition hearing enters second dayAssange's defense team hit back at allegations by lawyers for the US that he had deliberately put lives at risk by publishing the diplomatic cables in an unredacted form.Tuesday's hearing is part of Assange's long-running battle against being sent to the United States for trial. The hearing began on Monday. Assange was arrested on a US extradition warrant in April last year at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he had been living since 2012. The WikiLeaks founder originally sought political asylum at the embassy weeks after the UK's Supreme Court denied his appeal against extradition to Sweden, where he was wanted for questioning over allegations of sexual assault. He denied the allegation; the investigation was dropped last year.He now faces 18 charges in the US for his alleged role in encouraging, receiving and publishing classified documents linked to national defense. If convicted, he could be sentenced to up to 175 years in jail.Trump wants to 'make an example' of WikiLeaks' Julian Assange, court toldOn the opening day of the hearing, lawyers for the US government argued that Assange had put the lives of sources and informants in \"immediate\" danger, and damaged the capabilities of US forces carrying out operations abroad.But on Tuesday, Assange's legal team hit back at what it said were the prosecution's \"lies.\" Lawyer Summers said that \"far from being a reckless, unredacted release,\" one of Wikileaks' media partners had published the password to the unredacted materials. This \"enabled the entire world to publish those unredacted materials,\" he said. \"They circulated on the internet, not on the Wikileaks site, but on other sites.\"Summers added that \"the US government was involved in the redaction process.\" He explained that WikiLeaks -- which partnered with media organizations around the world including the Guardian, the New York Times, Germany's Der Spiegel, France's Le Monde and El Pais in Spain -- had a procedure in place to identify and redact the names of individuals considered to be at risk.Assange complains of prison treatment Assange has been held at London's Belmarsh prison since last year. On Tuesday, his lawyers complained about the inhumane treatment they said had been meted out to him at the high-security facility.Assange was handcuffed 11 times, stripped naked twice, and put into a series of  holding cells at the prison, his lawyers said.\"Treatment of this nature could impinge on his ability to participate in these proceedings,\" defense lawyer Edward Fitzgerald told the court.Supporters of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, hold placards calling for his freedom outside Woolwich Crown Court on Monday.Judge Vanessa Barrister told the court that her powers were limited in relation to the prison service.Meanwhile, chants of \"free Assange\" could be heard from protesters outside the court. Already this week, the high-profile case has attracted celebrity campaigners including British fashion designer Vivienne Westwood.The latest chapter in Assange's legal battle is far from over, with the hearing expected to take several weeks.CNN's Claudia Rebaza contributed to this report",

He was in an ebullient mood ahead of the fight and was filmed dancing and grinning before entering the ring.\"I'm going to knock him out this time, where last time I boxed him,\" Fury told CNN's Don Riddell on the eve of the bout. \"I'm going to punch him in the face multiple times until he falls to the floor in a heap and there he will lay and I will stand over the top of him, gazing down at him on the floor.\"The scene played out almost exactly as Fury predicted. Tyson Fury knocks down Deontay Wilder in the fifth round of their fight.In the seventh round, with blood streaming from his face, Wilder eventually succumbed to Fury's relentless assault. Late last year, Fury split with trainer Ben Davison and partnered with Javan \"SugarHill\" Steward and his cousin Andy Lee at Detroit's Kronk Gym, where the Briton had previously trained as a fresh-faced 21-year-old. The newly installed trainers spoke before the fight about helping Fury to focus on the basics -- balance, movement in the ring, and punching technique.\"Wilder has real power and that's a great thing. But that power's not so great when it's used against you. Sometimes you can wait for that big punch too long,\" Lee told The Guardian ahead of the fight.\"(Fury's) balance has improved. With improved balance comes greater power. By punching at the same time, and countering him before he lands, he can definitely knock Wilder out.\"It was Fury's inability to effectively land a big shot on Wilder that cost him in the first fight, which ended in a controversial draw after the US fighter had twice floored the Briton.JUST WATCHEDDeontay Wilder on fight with Tyson Fury and Anthony JoshuaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHDeontay Wilder on fight with Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua 04:43'Only just started'Saturday's victory wrote another remarkable chapter in Fury's turbulent career.Outside the ring, he has defended making homophobic and sexist comments in 2015, and more recently has won plaudits for speaking openly about his battle with depression and addiction that saw him contemplate driving his Ferrari off a bridge at high speed in 2016.He told CNN's Don Riddell last year that hoped to \"help people, save one person's life\" by speaking openly about managing his mental health, and said ahead of fighting Wilder that he would be \"dead within a year\" if he stopped going to the gym.JUST WATCHEDTyson Fury looking to save lives and win beltsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTyson Fury looking to save lives and win belts 04:18As far as his boxing is concerned, Fury is optimistic.

        "content": "(CNN)Four-time Olympic gold medalist Mo Farah is under the spotlight for injections he received ahead of the London Marathon in 2014.An investigation by BBC's Panorama, entitled \"Mo Farah and the Salazar Scandal,\" raises renewed questions over Farah's relationship with former coach Alberto Salazar, who is appealing against a four-year ban for doping violations which he denies.Farah was tested six days after receiving the injections. He recorded a number of medicines but failed to note L-carnitine on his doping control form, according to the Panorama investigation.  When drug tested, athletes are required to note all the medicines and supplements they have taken within the past seven days.The program also alleged that Farah repeatedly denied taking L-carnitine injections ahead of the London Marathon when questioned by US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) officials in 2015, only to return minutes after the interview had concluded to say he did in fact receive the injections.L-carnitine is a naturally occurring amino acid that enhances athletic performance. It is prohibited to have infusions of more than 50ml in the space of six hours.Read MoreMo Farah competes in the London Marathon in April 2014.Farah changed his account after speaking with UK Athletics' (UKA) head of endurance Barry Fudge, who had been interviewed by USADA the previous day, according to Panorama.Farah then immediately returned to the USADA officials he had just been interviewed by to clarify that he had received injections.His lawyers said in a statement that the athlete \"understood the question (from USADA officials) one way and as soon as he left the room he asked Mr. Fudge and immediately returned ... to clarify and it is plain the investigators were comfortable with this explanation.\"Alberto Salazar: Top athletics coach banned for four years for doping violationsThe statement added: \"It is not against (anti-doping) rules to take (L-carnitine) as a supplement within the right quantities.\"Mr Farah ... is one of the most tested athletes in the UK, if not the world, and has been required to fill in numerous doping forms. He is a human being and not a robot. That is relevant ... if in fact something was missed from the form. Interviews are not memory tests.\"The Panorama report also alleged that in emails between UKA officials, Fudge questioned whether Farah's use of L-carnitine was within the \"spirit of the sport,\" while UKA's performance director Neil Black, who parted ways with the organization last year, admitted to having \"a degree of discomfort\" about the injections.\"That's pretty damning,\" Toni Minichiello, who coached Olympic heptathlon gold medalist Jessica Ennis-Hill, told Panorama. \"I'm shocked. Barry Fudge in that instance has to explain... what was your logic for doing that? And you're an employee of UK Athletics, so UK Athletics, why would you allow one of your staff to do that?\"Mo Farah: 'I've never taken performance enhancing drugs'UK Athletics said in a statement Monday that it has an \"absolute zero tolerance policy towards the use of banned performance enhancing drugs and methods and toward any and all doping practices within sport.\"It added: \"L-carnitine is a legal and scientifically legitimate food supplement that can be used by endurance athletes across a number of sports. It is not a prohibited substance and has previously been used in drink form.\"Over the past few years, a small number of British athletes have used L-carnitine, and, to our knowledge, all doses and methods of administration have been fully in accordance with WADA protocol.\"The statement also specified that the dosage Farah took prior to the London Marathon was \"well within the 50ml limit permitted.\"Farah finished eighth in the London Marathon in 2014.The 2014 London Marathon was Farah's first race over the distance.The emails obtained by Panorama allege that Farah's then-coach Salazar was \"keen\" on the athlete taking L-carnitine. Salazar coached Farah between 2011 and 2017, a period in which the Briton won gold medals in the 5,000m and 10,000m at the 2012 and 2016 Olympic Games.Salazar previously ran the Nike Oregon Project, which Farah was part of, and was handed a four-year ban by USADA last year. The Oregon Project was shut down after the ban was announced.CNN has contacted Salazar for comment but did not immediately receive a response. He told the BBC, however, that \"no Oregon Project athlete used a medication against the spirit of the sport. Any medication taken was done so on the advice and under the supervision of registered medical professionals.\"In a statement to CNN, USADA CEO Travis Tygart said that the Panorama program highlighted \"the medicalization of sport we've seen in the US and the UK, where support personnel experiment with the careers and well-being of athletes.\"Nike to launch investigation after former athlete claims coach's regimen drove her to suicidal thoughts Tygart added: \"The sport officials' untested use of an L-carnitine infusion on elite level athletes is sadly one of the many examples uncovered by USADA's investigation in which we saw winning prioritized over athlete health.\"Coercive sports systems that employ cloak and dagger trials like those led by Alberto Salazar rob athletes of having a true choice, and only the eradication of those systems will ensure sport is relevant and trusted.\"Matt Majendie, sports correspondent for the London Evening Standard, told CNN that \"there is a fine line between what is legally and ethically acceptable in sport, a line that athletes and athletics have repeatedly crossed.\"The suggestion is not that Mo Farah broke WADA rules concerning his injections of L-carnitine before the 2014 London Marathon but whether such an action was in 'the spirit of the sport,' as raised by officials at UK Athletics, who were working closely with Farah.\"And the situation gets murkier still with the initial denials by Farah to USADA officials of ever having had such an injection followed by the sudden U-turn, and the failure to have logged said injections by his doctor. Once more in the sport, the lines have been blurred between right and wrong.\"Farah ended his working relationship with Salazar in October 2017, attributing his decision to a desire to return to the UK. Allegations about Salazar's practices first surfaced in 2015.",

        "content": "(CNN)Italy was racing Monday to contain the first major outbreak of a deadly new coronavirus in Europe, prompting fears that the international community is losing the battle to prevent the virus from becoming a full-scale pandemic.Is it safe for travelers to visit Italy?The epicenter of the outbreak is in northern Italy, where at least 7 people have died and the number of confirmed cases jumped from three on Friday morning to at least 229 by Monday evening. Authorities announced sweeping restrictions over the weekend for parts of the regions of Lombardy and Veneto. The restrictions affect about 100,000 people, the civil protection agency estimated on Monday. While most of the cases have been reported in the two regions, there were additional cases in Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont and Lazio.A team of health experts from the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control arrived in Italy on Monday, to assist local authorities. Read MoreTourist attractions have been closed, private meetings have been banned and schools have been shut. People inside these areas are being asked to stay inside and avoid contact with others. The measures also include transport restrictions in some places and the surveillance and quarantine of individuals who may have been exposed to the virus, according to Italy's health minister.The WHO said it was concerned over what it called the \"rapid\" increase in reported cases in Italy. \"However, it should also be noted that based on current data, in the majority of cases (4 out of every 5) people experience mild or no symptoms,\" the organization said in a statement.Stranded lobsters and missing wedding dresses: The coronavirus is a daily reminder of China's global reachWhile European officials are still urging for calm and Italian authorities believe that the spread has been contained, the fact that an outbreak of this scale has happened in a European Union member state will spark fears of wider contagion, given the EU's Schengen Area, which allows people in most EU member states to move between countries without border checks. The majority of the deaths and cases are in Lombardy, not far from Milan, the region's capital and world-famous tourist hotspot. The city was far quieter than usual on Monday morning, with even its famous Gothic cathedral closed to tourists. And even in this major financial capital, the news of the outbreak appeared to trigger a run on some supermarkets.People wearing respiratory masks wait to get into a supermarket in Casalpusterlengo, southeast of Milan, on Sunday.Beppe Sala, Milan's mayor, said that \"rather than dashing to the supermarkets to grab food, perhaps we should spend time looking after the most vulnerable, such as old people, who are particularly at risk.\"Petra Dalla Tor, a resident of Milan, told CNN that while some shelves were empty at her supermarket, she was able to stock up on enough supplies to tide her over. \"[I've] never seen it before, but I must say that the rest of the supermarket was okay, the empty shelves were only regarding pasta, biscuits, and canned goods. No problem with fresh fruits and vegetables,\" she said.\"I don't really understand how serious the situation is, so I just wanted to buy something and be prepared for the week,\" she added. \"Masks are unavailable in all the pharmacies and via Amazon it will take a couple of weeks to have them ... people bought all of them and pharmacies run out of stock, I guess. Same with hand sanitizer.\"A half-empty supermarket shelf in Milan. Viktoria Bozukova, a Milan resident, told CNN she had looked for masks in eight shops on Sunday and three on Monday but that all were sold out. \"There are no masks and they don't know when they are going to have [them],\" she said. Attilio Fontana, Lombardy's president, has urged residents to stay calm and stop panic-buying, saying \"rushing to stock up on food doesn't make any sense. There are enough supplies.\"Matteo Marconi, who lives in the small municipality of Castiglione d'Adda, said he had not experienced the same level of supermarket runs reported in Milan.  \"The only real queue was at the pharmacy where a civil protection officer regulates the entrances ... for now it feels like a long weekend, but eventually I think it will start to feel like a situation of constraint,\" he told CNN. \"We live by the day. There are very few people around and they wear masks ... We live near the countryside so we can go outside and walk around, but we limit contact with others as much as possible.\" A sign indicating that facemasks are sold out in one pharmacy in Venice on Monday. Meanwhile in Venice -- capital of Veneto -- the situation is complicated by the fact that the city is in the middle of its annual carnival, one of the largest tourist events in the Venetian calendar. Before it was canceled, it was due to run until Tuesday, which meant an increased number of visitors, putting greater strain on local authorities.Luca Zaia, the president of Veneto, confirmed on Sunday that there had been several dozen cases in the region, including two in the city of Venice. He said that private and public meetings were banned until March 1.The people of Venice are letting their frustrations be known. Roberto, who works at a bar in St. Mark's Square, said, \"Why are they here? Why aren't we blocking them,\" while pointing to a group of Chinese tourists. \"This could have been avoided if we closed the ports, blocked all flights coming from China, Korea, Japan.\"People wearing protective masks in Venice on Sunday.While countries like Germany, Switzerland and Austria are not imposing travel restrictions on people coming from Italy just yet, fears will remain over Europe's ability to contain a crisis like this. The combination of the continent's relatively open borders and a highly infectious virus that experts say can spread without a carrier showing any sign of symptoms means that the potential is there for the situation to worsen in a hurry.As Stella Kyriakides, the European commissioner for health, tweeted on Sunday: \"Viruses know no borders, it is only through global cooperation and coordination that we will be able to contain the spread of #COVID19.\"CNN's Valentina Di Donato contributed to this report.",

'Never have thought it was possible'Liverpool was certainly not as its pulsating best but showed hallmarks of a champion by finding a way to win. Pablo Fornals had given West Ham a surprise second-half lead after Georginio Wijnaldum's opening goal was canceled out by Issa Diop's header. But the Reds rallied to stage a predictable recovery. However, in truth, the hosts benefited from a goalkeeping error that allowed Mohamed Salah to draw level before Sadio Mane tapped in the winner from yet another cross from Trent Alexander-Arnold.With two assists on the night, the 21-year-old full-back became the third youngest player to reach 25 EPL assists, behind only Wayne Rooney and Cesc Fabregas.Liverpool is now 22 points clear at the top of the table and needs just four more wins to clinch its first domestic title since 1990. The team has already won as many games as Arsenal's 'Invincible' side from the 2003-2004 season and equaled its own all-time English record of 21 home league wins, set by the Reds in 1972. \"Could I have wished for a better position to go into these last 11 games? No, I would never have thought it was possible, but each one of them is really difficult and we respect that a lot,\" added Klopp, who passionately celebrated his side's latest victory.

        "content": "(CNN)Paris Saint-Germain bounced back from the disappointment of its Champions League defeat by Borussia Dortmund with victory over Bordeaux -- but it was far from straightforward.The two teams shared seven goals in one of the most thrilling games of the Ligue 1 season, as PSG came from a goal behind to secure a 4-3 win and extend its lead at the top of the table to 13 points.But the game ended on something of a sour note with Neymar shown a red card for a second bookable offense after clumsily hacking down Yacine Adli.The Brazilian appeared to have been left aggrieved after referee Willy Delajod declined to award him a number of free kicks; Neymar left the pitch sarcastically applauding the official and tore his shirt off in frustration.Though the victory will come as a relief to PSG, there will be some concern for coach Thomas Tuchel at the number of goals his team is conceding.Read MoreAs well as the two conceded midweek against Dortmund, PSG shipped another four in last weekend's frenetic 4-4 draw against Ligue 1 struggler Amiens.READ: Neymar and Kylian Mbappe hailed as 'two of the best four players in the world' by PSG's LeonardoREAD: Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi charged with criminal offenses in FIFA caseNeymar received his second yellow card for a clumsy challenge on Yacine Adli.Cavani landmarkTo compound its defensive frailties, PSG lost captain and central defender Thiago Silva to a thigh injury after 25 minutes, which makes the Brazilian a doubt for the French Cup semifinal against Lyon and the Champions League second leg against Dortmund next month.There was some good news for PSG as striker Edinson Cavani scored a landmark 200th goal for the club since moving to the French capital in 2013, netting the equalizer after Hwang Ui-jo had opened the scoring for Bordeaux.Though he has struggled for fitness and game time this season, scoring only five goals, the Uruguayan is the club's all-time record goalscorer.After Marquinhos, who replaced the injured Silva as captain, had given PSG the lead once again, then arrived arguably the strangest goal of the weekend.Stand-in PSG goalkeeper Sergio Rico shanked his clearance straight into the shins of Bordeaux defender Pablo and the ball cannoned into the goal.Marquinhos once again came to PSG's rescue, scoring again to mark his first ever double for the club, before Kylian Mbappe got the fourth goal soon after.Edinson Cavani celebrates his 200th goal for PSG.Ruben Pardo's thunderbolt seven minutes from time set up a nervous finish for the Parisians but they held on for victory, despite going a man down in the dying stages.While there is no doubt PSG can be devastating going forward and possesses one of the most lethal attacking forces in Europe, any hope of winning a maiden Champions League title will be surely be over if Tuchel can't find a way to plug the leaks in defense.Message of solidarityFor the match against Bordeaux, PSG replaced its regular shirt sponsor with the message \"Stay Strong China\" in English and Chinese to show support for the efforts in fighting the deadly coronavirus.PSG's official sponsor was replaced with a messge of solidarity for China.Since the outbreak at the end of 2019 -- which is believed to have come from a seafood market in Wuhan, the capital of central China's Hubei province -- more than 2,600 people are confirmed to have died and more than 79,000 people have been infected.Before the match, banners in the middle of the pitch and in the team photo also showed the message of solidarity on a weekend that saw the coronavirus affect European football.A number of matches in Italy's Serie A were canceled as the government put emergency measures into place after a spike in cases in the country.",

        "content": "London (CNN)US President Donald Trump is trying to \"make an example\" of Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder's defense team argued in a London court Monday at the start of his extradition hearing.By publishing a trove of classified defense documents relating to Iraq and Afghanistan, Assange had revealed evidence of war crimes, his legal team said.Lawyers for the US government argued that by publishing the diplomatic cables in an unredacted form, Assange had put the lives of sources and informants in \"immediate\" danger, and damaged the capabilities of US forces carrying out operations abroad, Assange, 48, was arrested on a US extradition warrant in April last year at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he had lived since claiming asylum there in 2012.He faces 18 charges in the US for his alleged role in encouraging, receiving and publishing classified documents linked to national defense. If convicted, he could be sentenced to up to 175 years in jail.Read MoreCounsel for the US government, James Lewis, told Woolwich Crown Court, that Assange could not use journalism as an excuse for hacking. \"Reporting or journalism is not a license for criminality,\" Lewis told the court. In any case, Assange was not entitled claim a journalism defense, as he was not a journalist, Lewis argued. Lewis said Assange had previously conceded that the publication of names was regrettable. But the lawyer said that \"what is alleged is far more than regrettable -- it's criminal.\" Lewis told the court that the charges against Assange were not linked to his publication of evidence of any war crimes, but instead related to \"publishing specific classified documents that contained unredacted names of innocent people who risked their safety and freedom to aid United States and its allies.\"Supporters Julian Assange outside Woolwich Crown Court on Monday.Representing Assange, lawyer Edward Fitzgerald said asking for extradition on the basis of what was \"clearly\" a political case was an abuse of the court's process. \"Julian Assange is being made an example of. President Trump and his administration decided to make an example of Julian Assange,\" Fitzgerald said, adding that Assange's actions had brought evidence of war crimes to public attention.Trump in 2016: 'I love WikiLeaks,' Trump now: 'I know nothing about WikiLeaks'At a preliminary hearing last week, Fitzgerald said that former US congressman Dana Rohrabacher had offered the WikiLeaks founder a pardon on behalf of President Trump, in exchange for denying Russian involvement in the leak of emails from the Democratic National Committee in 2016. Wikileaks published the emails in July that year.The White House and Rohrabacher have strongly denied that Trump intervened in Assange's case. Rohrabacher has previously said the visit was \"my own fact finding mission,\" and claimed he had never spoken to Trump about Assange. White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham dismissed Fitzgerald's claim as \"a total lie.\"On Monday, Fitzgerald told the court that Rohrabacher had approached Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy and discussed a \"preemptive pardon.\" The former congressman was accompanied on the visit by controversial conservative blogger Charles \"Chuck\" Johnson. The pair made it clear that they were acting on behalf of the President, who had approved of the meeting, Fitzgerald said.Assange's defense team said Rohrbacher presented what he called a \"win-win\" solution, whereby Assange could identify the source of the DNC hack in return for a pardon. Assange did not identify the source, Fitzgerald said.

Chants of \"no extradition\" from the crowd of Assange supporters gathered outside could be clearly heard inside the courtroom.During Monday's proceedings, judge Vanessa Baraitser asked counsel to pass a message to the protesters outside, warning them they risked harming the case because journalists -- especially those who didn't make it into the courtroom -- were struggling to hear the proceedings.\"I'm having difficulty concentrating, this noise is not helpful either,\" said Assange, who appeared in court wearing a gray suit, white shirt and gray sweater. \"I'm very appreciative of the public support and understand they must be disgusted by these proceedings,\" he added.

        "content": "London (CNN)Boris Johnson has a problem. Since his landslide election win in December, the British Prime Minister has attempted to frame his personal success as the moment Brits could confidently move on from Brexit and into a bright new future. Yet despite Johnson's sunny optimism, a near-constant stream of darker, nastier messages has been seeping out of 10 Downing Street. And the finger of blame is being pointed at Johnson's most senior adviser, Dominic Cummings. Cummings is one of the most controversial figures in current British politics. Credited with masterminding the successful campaign to leave the European Union, Cummings has a reputation for being a control freak and a brutal disruptor who loathes convention and the political establishment in equal measure. However, for all his apparent control-freakery, Cummings, according to some, is a man whose purest instincts are causing him to spiral out of control. Read MoreSince joining Johnson in Downing Street, Cummings has been at the center of the biggest arguments surrounding the British government. The most recent incident involved one of Cummings' subordinates, Andrew Sabisky, being forced to resign after it emerged that he had previously made comments in support of eugenics, and the relative intellects of black and white Americans. The Metro newspaper, a free newspaper read by millions of commuters on their way to work all over the country, ran with the headline \"Racist 'weirdo' quits No.10 job.\" Dominic CummingsThat the word weirdo appears in quote marks is significant. It's a reference to an advertisement that Cummings posted on his personal blog earlier this year, inviting \"weirdos and misfits\" to apply to work in Downing Street. That's how Sabisky appears to have come to work for the Prime Minister. The government has refused to say whether he was properly vetted, or whether Cummings hired him without consulting anyone.The Sabisky controversy followed months of \"Classic Dom\" moments, as the British media refers to his interventions. Highlights include firing the top adviser to a cabinet minister and then having her escorted from Downing Street by armed police; playing divide and conquer with the press by excluding out-of-favor journalists from government briefings; suggesting that the government is preparing for all-out war with the BBC; and putting the Prime Minister in the curious position of having to step in and defend the BBC from his own government. Close allies of Cummings suggest that stories about him are blown out of proportion and that, rather than engaging in a communications battle and talking to journalists, Cummings spends the majority of his time dealing with policy and the day-to-day management of the Downing Street team. Boris Johnson's adviser who voiced support for eugenics has resigned But stories about the Prime Minister's most senior advisor are getting a lot of attention in the UK at the moment. And some government ministers and Conservative lawmakers are starting to lose patience. \"There is a crushing loss of faith in Dom and his ability to deliver on this radical agenda,\" said one government minister, who rued Cummings' habit of drawing the limelight from otherwise positive stories.CNN approached Downing Street and Cummings for comment on the claims made in this article, however they declined to directly address them. The longer Cummings remains the most powerful person in Johnson's inner circle, the more likely that frustration is to infect the Prime Minister himself. \"When Boris won the majority, there was a huge amount of goodwill from lots of us who were previously skeptical about his leadership. But we are still waiting to see what he does with that it,\" said one influential Conservative political figure.That goodwill erodes every time Conservatives are forced to put out fires started by the man who is supposed to be driving their Prime Minister's agenda. All of which leads to the question: why is Cummings still working for the Prime Minister? \"Boris has the power to rein him in if he wanted to. But at the moment clearly he feels that Cummings is doing what he wants him to do -- moving forward with a disruptive but productive program,\" says Tim Bale, Professor of Politics at Queen Mary University in London. Cummings' allies point to the fact that despite his brutal style, he has delivered for the very same establishment Conservatives who find his approach to politics vulgar. \"We might hear rumblings now and again, but he was vindicated when the Brexit deal happened in November. It was the same with the election,\" says a friend and former colleague. \"As long as he keeps performing for Boris, the longer it remains worth it for Boris.\"Boris Johnson (R) and Dominic Cummings at Downing Street in September.And as long as Johnson continues to think having Cummings inside the tent is worth it, things are unlikely to change. \"Dom's always been of the view that unless he's in complete control there is no point in him being in the job,\" says the Cummings ally. Civil servants and other advisers who have worked with Cummings say his management style is to make it clear to as many people as possible that he is in total control. Once he has asserted his dominance, he attempts to expand his sphere of influence. In Downing Street, he's done this by trying his best to erode the traditional relationship between cabinet ministers and their special advisers. Rather than be loyal to their bosses, advisers say Cummings demands they be loyal to him. One former adviser to a cabinet minister said there was a drive to ensure that \"Dom's people\" were working for ministers deemed to be \"rogue or disloyal.\"And this isn't merely a power trip for Cummings. People who have worked with him explain that Cummings doesn't distrust people, he just doesn't trust them to make the correct decisions. Multiple sources told CNN that Cummings sincerely believes himself to be more intelligent than almost anyone he interacts with.The EU is facing a serious crisis. It's funding the same people who wish to wreck itJohnson knew what he was letting himself in for. Allies of Cummings say that when he was offered the job, he made it clear to Johnson that if he was to build a loyalist court, then he wanted to be king. Special advisers believe that Johnson was happy to agree, because he didn't want to suffer the rebellions that ultimately brought down his predecessor, Theresa May. Of course, Cummings is only powerful for as long as Johnson believes his aggressive style of politics is a net benefit. The real question is if and when Cummings tips over into being more costly than he's worth. \"There is always a trade-off between having people feel like they have to get with the program or creating what some suggest is a climate of fear that impacts negatively on their loyalty and productively,\" says Bale, the politics professor.Allies and enemies predict that this won't last forever. A government minister explained that Cummings' aggressive manner was \"a bad look for a party with a reputation among some for being nasty.\"And as one of his friends put it, \"the more people who have run-ins with him, the more enemies he will have. I have half a feeling it [Cummings' demise] could end up being some sort of HR matter where he's clearly gone so overboard in terms of bullying. It could be his unusual hiring. Or it could be a bad decision.\"If and when the end comes for Cummings, most believe it will be a self-inflicted wound. It will be because he cannot trust others to do things correctly, so he stretches himself too thin and makes a mistake. The image those who know him paint is one of a man who could easily blow himself up trying to fix his own boiler because he thinks the plumber is an idiot. Until that moment, the most controversial man in British politics will continue to be the one of the most powerful men in British politics. And, as painful a pill this is to swallow, until Boris Johnson decides enough is enough, those tearing their hair out over Cummings' unusual approach to work will have to suck it up.",

Literally.Arizona Diamondbacks left-hander Madison Bumgarner is one of the greatest postseason pitchers of all time -- and until the weekend, he quietly was enjoying another hobby.Bumgarner, 30, told The Athletic that he had been using the alias Mason Saunders to take part in rodeo events, explaining to the sports news website he has been competing under the alias to try to not attract attention.The surname is from his wife's maiden name. \"Mason\" is short for \"Madison,\" which, Bumgarner said to The Athletic, is \"something for my wife to call me when we were out in public to keep people from recognizing me.\"The three-time World Series champion and 2014 World Series MVP then added: \"But you're going to ruin that for me.\"Read MoreIn early December, Bumgarner won $26,560 in a team-roping rodeo competition in Wickenburg, Arizona.

One shows Bumgarner competing on horseback, while the other shows him after he earned his winnings, with the pitcher giving a smile in the blurry photo.'Ruining my alias'\"Oh boy,\" Bumgarner said to The Athletic on Sunday, when shown a photo of himself. \"This is ruining my alias.\"A couple weeks after his rodeo success, Bumgarner signed a five-year, $85 million contract with the Diamondbacks in December after playing his first 11 MLB seasons with the San Francisco Giants.

In an interview with MLB.com in 2016, Bumgarner, who grew up in rural North Carolina, said he learned roping from his future father-in-law when he was around 15 or 16 years old. He also said at the time that rodeo could become more than just a hobby once he retires from baseball.The Athletic asked the Diamondbacks if it was OK for their star pitcher to rope while under contract, and general manager Mike Hazen said that he would not get into specific contract language.Previously, when Bumgarner was with the Giants, he missed three months of the 2017 season after suffering a shoulder injury in a dirt bike accident, at the time calling it \"definitely not the most responsible decision\" he had made.",

A further penalty by Farrell left England 17-0 to the good at the half, the lead cut almost immediately after the restart as Robbie Henshaw squeezed over for an Ireland try, the conversion missed by Johnny Sexton.The Irish revival was short lived and powerful play by the England forwards saw Luke Cowan-Dickie score the third try, with Farrell again converting.Ireland's centre Robbie Henshaw gets the ball down to score his side's first try in the 24-12 defeat to England.Further Irish consolation came at the final whistle with Andrew Porter going over for his first international try, converted by John Cooney.Ireland captain Sexton acknowledged that \"our mistakes not covering chips for the two tries\" had cost his side dear, despite a second half fightback.Under new coach Andy Farrell, the father of England centre Owen, Ireland still has much to play for with a home game against Italy and a potential championship decider against France in Paris.Eddie Jones' England can seal the Triple Crown with victory over Wales at Twickenham in a fortnight and go to Italy in the final round of fixtures hoping championship leaders France slip up.France makes it three from threeSaturday's action saw France, inspired by fly-half Romain Ntamack, stay firmly on course for the Grand Slam and Six Nations crown  with a thrilling  27-23 victory over defending champion Wales.Ntamack scored a superb intercept try at a crucial stage in the second half after Wales had closed to 16-17 down and kicked 12 points with his boot as France secured its first win in Cardiff since 2010.It was also revenge for Les Bleus' quarterfinal defeat to Wales in the World Cup last year and has left the French with a winning record after three games having already beaten England and Italy.France's Romain Ntamack races away to score his side's crucial third try in the 27-23 win over Wales at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff.Ntamack, son of a famous former French international Emile, was part of a young team with just 234 caps against a Six Nations record 859 for Wales.\"We have no experience but we play with a smile but it was good experience to win here,\" he said.Wales coach Wayne Pivac pointed to the Ntamack try as the crucial moment, although a late Dan Biggar try still gave his side late hope.\"After half-time everything went to plan in terms of the momentum shift. We got back into the game and the intercept killed that momentum,\" Pivac said.\"We have to make sure the big moments in the game go our way,\" he added.Scotland wins in RomeMeanwhile, Scotland made no mistake against Italy in Rome, running in three tries in a 17-0 victory over the perennial wooden spoon team.Disappointing defeats to Ireland and England had left Gregor Townsend's men under pressure going into the match, but his team stepped up to the challenge.

        "content": "(CNN)Both the National Football League and Major League Baseball are considering changing their playoff formats, according to reports by ESPN and the New York Post.How fans feel about the possible changes is up to them \u2014 some might want to watch more games, while others might be traditionalists and resistant to change. But for the leagues and their broadcasting partners, longer postseasons mean one thing. \"Money. It's a very easy answer,\" John Ourand, a media reporter for the Sports Business Journal, told CNN. \"Money.\" What the leagues are proposing ESPN reported this week the NFL's owners are considering changes to both the regular season and the playoffs under a proposed collective bargaining agreement (CBA). NFL owners are considering expanding the playoffs to include more teamsRead MoreThe owners reportedly want to expand the playoffs from six teams per conference to seven. Only the top seed from each conference would receive a bye in the first round, instead of the top two seeds, which is how it's handled currently. They'd also like to increase the number of regular season games from 16 to 17 and decrease the number of preseason games from 4 to 3, according to ESPN.Changes are also afoot for MLB, according to the New York Post. It reported MLB is considering bringing the number of teams entering its postseason from 5 to 7 in each league by adding two more wild-card teams. The club with the best record in each league would receive a bye in the wild card round and move to the Division series, per the Post. \"The two other division winners and the wild card with the next-best record would each host all three games in a best-of-three wild-card round,\" the Post reported. MLB would also reportedly implement a live playoff selection TV show in which teams select opponents on the last day of the regular season. CNN reached out to the offices of the NFL and the MLB for comment.The leagues stand to gain a lot ...Both leagues might be beloved American institutions to millions of fans, but they're also meant to make money. It's clear why the NFL and its owners would be in favor of adding more teams to the playoffs. It means more games, and more games means more money.Super Bowl LIV averaged 102 million viewers\"From a management point of view, you want more inventory to sell,\" said Andrew Brandt, a former vice president of the Green Bay Packers and the executive director of the Moorad Center for the Study of Sports Law at Villanova University. \"And just think of all the ancillary revenue opportunities around an extra game -- whether it's suites at your home stadium, your marketing, the hotels, the economic impact throughout the city.\" The TV networks also reap the benefits, said Brandt. \"These NFL games,\" he said, \"it's the only must-see programming on television right now.\"The NFL had a good year for ratings. The 2019 season was the NFL's most watched in three years and kept up the momentum from the 2018 season. Viewership was up about 5% from 2018, with about 16.5 million viewers between the league's TV partners.The postseason was a success, too. The Wild Card weekend saw its biggest viewership in four years, and viewership for the divisional round was up 2% from the year before.  It culminated with Super Bowl LIV, which averaged 102 million viewers across several channels and streaming outlets. The NFL's deals with NBC, Fox and CBS run until 2022, and its deal with ESPN runs until 2021. And the league would want to have this deal done before negotiating rights deals, Ourand said. \"NFL programming is the most popular programming genre on television, and it's not even close,\" he said. \"For the TV networks to be able to get more NFL programming is great news for them.\" MLB has similar motivations for expanding its playoffs, said Ourand. \"In all these leagues the playoffs are the highest-rated games of the year. So if you expand the playoffs it makes your products a lot more valuable.\" MLB considering new playoff format and live selection TV show, report says\"Obviously the incentive here is that it would bring a lot more money by TV deals,\" said Ginny Searle, an associate editor of Baseball Prospectus, which provides baseball statistics and analysis. MLB's reported changes would go into effect before the 2022 season, Searle said, right after the league's broadcasting deal with ESPN and Turner expires. Its current deal with Fox covers much of the playoffs, but changing the format would  \"add in basically a whole new round that there could be bidding on, there could be rights to,\" Searle said. And the proposed playoff selection TV show could offer more opportunities for licensing.... but it's not so great for the playersBut the NFL and MLB will need to convince their players. Changes in both leagues will need their approval, and it could be a tough sell. \"They're going to play an extra game,\" Ourand said of NFL players, \"and it remains to be seen how they're going to be compensated for that.\" The NFL players union declined to comment citing ongoing negotiations, but released a statement Friday that said, \"Our player leadership looks forward to meeting with NFL management again next week before the Board takes a vote shortly after.\"There are factors outside compensation, including the toll the game takes on NFL players' bodies. Brandt pointed out players have been opposed to adding games for the last several years, \"because of the injury impact, because of the realization that right now we have so many players getting injured, whether bodily injuries or head injuries.\"  Photos: Athletes and CTEFormer pro football player Kevin Turner, shown here during a 1998 NFL game, had the most advanced stage of CTE when he died in March at the age of 46. Dr. Ann McKee of Boston University and the Concussion Legacy Foundation said that Turner's CTE brought on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. CTE stands for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a neurodegenerative disease associated with repeated head trauma.  Scientists believe repeated head trauma can cause CTE, a progressive degenerative disease of the brain. Symptoms include depression, aggression and disorientation, but scientists can definitively diagnose it only after death.Hide Caption 1 of 22 Photos: Athletes and CTEBMX star Dave Mirra, who was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot in February, was found to have CTE.

But if the league wanted more games, \"every vested player should receive lifetime healthcare instead of the current 5 years post-retirement.\" \"(T)hose terms should be nonnegotiable,\" he added.MLB players are in a similar situation, Searle said. In theory, more money would flow to the players if the league expanded is playoffs, she said. But \"so far most of the reaction we've heard from players has been dismissive, if not outright ridiculing this plan,\" she said. \"And I think that kind of shows you that they're not seeing the obvious benefits.\" \"There's not any big ticket item that says, we get this and you get that,\" Searle said. The MLB Players Association did not respond to a request for comment, but Executive Director Tony Clark previously said, \"Any measures that aim to incentivize competition are worth discussing. For playoff expansion specifically, the devil of those discussions will be in the details.\"CNN's Frank Pallotta, David Close, Ray Sanchez and Wayne Sterling contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)A controversial VAR decision overshadowed a damaging defeat for Jose Mourinho's Tottenham Hotspur on his latest return to Stamford Bridge as Chelsea bolstered its bid for a Champions League spot with a 2-1 victory Saturday.Goals for the returning Olivier Giroud and Marcos Alonso had already put Chelsea in command of the London derby when Tottenham's midfielder Giovani Lo Celso tangled with home captain Cesar Azpilcueta in the 52nd minute.Lo Celso SHOULD have been sent off for stamp on Azpilicueta as VAR admit they made a mistake #CHETOT https://t.co/pE5U8A70nh\u2014 MailOnline Sport (@MailSport) February 22, 2020 Lo Celso appeared to deliberately stamp on Azpilicueta's outstretched leg with his studs but referee Michael Oliver initially waved away Chelsea appeals before VAR officials at their studios in Stockley Park, west London were called into action to scrutinize the challenge.After a lengthy deliberation, it was ruled that there had been no serious foul play and the Argentine escaped either a yellow or red card much to the dismay of Chelsea manager Frank Lampard, who later described the Lo Celso tackle as a \"real leg breaker\" which should have been punished.BREAKING: We have been speaking to Stockley Park who have admitted they got the decision wrong and Lo Celso should have been sent off... @btsport\u2014 Jake Humphrey (@mrjakehumphrey) February 22, 2020 But later in the second half, broadcaster BT Sport reported that VAR officials had reviewed the decision and admitted that Lo Celso should have been sent off.Read MoreThe about face was met with derision on social media, with many former top professionals expressing their surprise that Lo Celso had escaped a red card.How is that not a red card?!!!!!\u2014 Ian Wright (@IanWright0) February 22, 2020 Lo Celso was eventually shown a yellow card for a foul on Mason Mount on the edge of the Tottenham penalty area in the 82nd minute. Alonso nearly scored his second and Chelsea's third as his free kick effort rattled the crossbar, but with a minute remaining the visitor struck with a rare decisive attack.Substitute Erik Lamela powered into the Chelsea penalty area and his effort was deflected into his own net by defender Antonio Rudiger, leaving for a nervy last few moments for the home side before a vital three points was sealed.Azpilicueta, sporting an ice pack taped to his leg, was happy with his team's victory, but incensed by the earlier VAR mistake.\"I'm not a player who likes to be on the floor. I am tough. But it was a clear stamp on my shin, I felt it straight away and was surprised it wasn't a red card. It wasn't even a yellow card! Everybody can make a mistake but when you have a lot of replays it should be easier,\" he told BT Sport.Chelsea's Cesar Azpilicueta and Giovani Lo Celso of Tottenham Hotspur are engaged in a heated discussion during their side's English Premier League match at Stamford Bridge.Lampard believes that the much-maligned use of VAR in the Premier League needs an urgent overhaul.\"It was a tackle that endangers a player, saying after that they made a mistake isn't good enough,\" he said.\"That's what VAR was brought in for. It's a huge question mark on VAR. This one doesn't need the referee to go to the monitor, it's a clear decision.\"The victory takes Chelsea four points clear of Tottenham in fourth place, but it was a second straight defeat for the visitor after losing 1-0 to RB Leipzig in the Champions League in midweek.Mourinho refused to be drawn on the Lo Celso incident, instead praising his team which is lacking a recognized striker after injuries to Harry Kane and Son Heung-min.\"I'm so proud of the boys they fought for the last seconds until a result. I cannot ask more from them, especially Lucas, Lo Celso, Bergwijn these boys that are playing every minute and trying to do miracles in positions that are not their positions. I cannot complain,\" he said.Minor consolation came for Tottenham in later fixtures Saturday, holding on to fifth spot as Sheffield United was held 1-1 at home by struggling Brighton, leaving the Blades in sixth on goal difference.Burnley moved up to eighth with a 3-0 win over Bournemouth with another VAR controversy the main talking point. Don't know where to begin with this one. VAR have disallowed a Goal for Bournemouth as they decided there was a handball in the build up (it wasn't). That handball was in the Bournemouth box so they gave a penalty to Burnley who scored. Ludicrous.\u2014 Gary Lineker (@GaryLineker) February 22, 2020 The visitor thought it had equalized when Harry Wilson fired home, but after a VAR review Cherries player Adam Smith was penalized for handball at the start of the counter attack and a penalty awarded to the home side, which Jay Rodriguez converted.Aston Villa remained deep in relegation trouble with a 2-0 defeat at Southampton, Crystal Palace beat Newcastle 1-0, while a late Gabriel Jesus goal gave champion Manchester City a 1-0 win at Leicester City in the late game to cement its grip on second place behind runaway leader Liverpool.",

        "content": "London (CNN)The British government has unveiled the country's new, blue post-Brexit passports, hailing the return of an \"iconic\" document that became a thorny issue during the UK's protracted departure from the European Union.The first dark blue passports, which ditch the burgundy covers used by EU member states, will be issued in early March, Home Secretary Priti Patel announced on Saturday. Patel spoke of her excitement that \"the British passport will once again be entwined with our national identity.\"Prime Minister Boris Johnson had previously praised the color change as a \"wonderful thing\" and bemoaned his \"sense of personal loss and outrage\" when the UK's previous blue passports were \"taken away\" in 1988.What neither mentioned, however, was that the new passports are being made by the Franco-Dutch firm Gemalto at its site in Tczew, Poland.\"I actually like the French-designed Polish-printed new UK passport,\" former Remain-backing MEP Seb Dance said after the launch. \"Of course the previous one -- which allowed Brits the right to work, study and retire freely across their own continent -- was probably more useful.\"Read MoreWhat Brexit will mean for travelersThe prospect of a return to blue passports became a divisive subplot during the UK's bitter EU referendum in 2016 and its torturous attempts to leave the bloc in the years since -- and those battle lines were re-drawn after the launch was confirmed.Brexiteers have frequently painted the move as a way to reclaim British identity and freedom from the EU, while Remainers saw it as a petty and inward-looking obsession. \"I think it's a wonderful thing if people want to have a blue passport again,\" Johnson told ITV News in 2017. \"I remember a sense of personal loss and outrage when they were taken away.\" The UK was under no obligation to change the color of its passports in 1988, but decided to do so in line with its fellow EU members.\"What a way to symbolise renewed national spirit,\" campaign group Leave.EU said on Twitter on Saturday, after the change was confirmed for March. Former British MEP Edward McMillan-Scott, in contrast, said the passports \"symbolise (a) prevailing Tory attitude to rest of Europe: isolationist, ignorant and self-destructive.\"The front cover of the new passport.The country prints new passports every few years, and the contract to make the new blue items was won by Gemalto in 2018 after it beat out British company De La Rue. At the time, Conservative MP Priti Patel called the decision \"disgraceful\" and \"perverse.\"But in more amenable language, Patel -- now the Home Secretary -- said on Saturday: \"Leaving the European Union gave us a unique opportunity to restore our national identity and forge a new path in the world.\"\"By returning to the iconic blue and gold design, the British passport will once again be entwined with our national identity and I cannot wait to travel on one,\" she added.The UK will now join 81 other countries which use blue on their passport covers, according to the Passport Index. The color is also adopted by nations including Argentina, Australia, Syria, Tuvalu and North Korea.Britain left the EU on January 31, but negotiations with the EU are set to continue this year ahead of the expiration of the transition period in the withdrawal agreement.",

Ukraine has no diagnosed cases of the novel coronavirus.

She said in a Facebook post that her daughter turns 10 today, and apologized for not celebrating it with her. It is unclear whether she has already joined the returnees. Zelensky urged Ukrainians to remember that \"we are all human\" and there was no danger, in a Facebook statement on Thursday.\"Unfortunately, not all of us can be proud of the same human reaction. Attempts to block the roads, block the hospitals, not allow Ukrainian citizens to Ukraine -- this does not show the best side of our character,\" he wrote. \"The Ukrainian always remains Ukrainian.

Those lack of attacking options were much in evidence on Wednesday as Spurs were beaten 1-0 by RB Leipzig in their Champions League last-16 tie.But former Porto striker McCarthy believes the 'Special One' will \"most definitely\" win a major trophy again.Speaking to CNN's Zayn Nabbi and the On The Whistle podcast, McCarthy says his former mentor's CV speaks for itself.\"As crap as people think he was at his time at [Manchester] United, they won the Europa League, they won ... the League Cup so it wasn't all bad.

But after starting the 2018-19 season with just seven wins in his first 17 Premier League games, Mourinho was sacked a week before Christmas in 2018.McCarthy believes Mourinho's decline at the club was primarily down to egos and ill-discipline from players. \"I think the Manchester United players didn't have the discipline at the time to handle Jose's tactics. I don't think he's a bad manager at all,\" said the 42-year-old McCarthy.\"How many players that were under Mourinho at Man United are people speaking well of? Not many, not many.\"Marcus Rashford, good professional, also had his hiccups, but he was never a player Mourinho had problems with.Mourinho substiutes Martial against Southampton.\"Anthony Martial is ill-disciplined, plays when he wants to. All talent, all the potential to be one of the best in the world, to be one of the best players you can find in modern day football. But he's a player when he's in the mood.\"But when you have a coach like Jose, that don't fly. It's your job, you must be in the mood every single day.\"Manchester United did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment, but in a recent interview with RMC Sport, Martial spoke about the way he was treated by the three-time Premier League winning manager. \"It's true that I'd have preferred it if he'd told me directly, there's no need to say it in front of everybody,\" Martial told RMC Sport.\"After that, you definitely want to prove him wrong. He didn't start me during the first few games and each time I came on, I scored.\"In the end, he told me: 'You see, now you understand what I wanted'. It can get to you. You just want to show him you deserve to be on the pitch.\"Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosMcCarthy says despite not having the players at United to seriously mount a challenge to win the Premier League, Mourinho was still able to produce big results. \"He was one the few managers to beat Pep (Guardiola) at the high-flying Man City football that they play.

Dissident artist Pyotr Pavlensky leaked explicit text messages and a 30-second video that Benjamin Griveaux, the official Paris mayoral candidate for Macron's governing La Republique en Marche party, allegedly sent to Alexandra de Taddeo.Griveaux, a former government spokesperson, was married with children at the time.\"I stole this video,\" Pavlensky told CNN in a TV interview, adding that his girlfriend, Alexandra de Taddeo, \"didn't know that I found and took the video.\" He says he discovered the footage last November.\"I showed her what I was doing after publication,\" said Pavlensky, who was granted political asylum in France in 2017.  This isn't America say French politicians, after candidate quits in sex scandalRead MoreDe Taddeo's lawyer,  Noemie Saidi-Cottier did not respond to CNN's multiple requests for comment but she told the Associated Press De Taddeo acknowledges receiving the alleged sex video but denies being involved with its publication online.  CNN has reached out to prosecutors to see if they're aware of Pavlensky's claim that he stole the footage.Pavlensky said de Taddeo was previously in a relationship with Griveaux, who dropped out of the race after the leak last week ahead of France's municipal elections that begin on March 15.\"For me this is only the beginning,\" Pavlensky said, adding that he was \"happy\" with the public's reaction.He said that his website, which is currently down, was a place where people could \"watch porn made by civil servants, politicians, representatives of power. It's porn, it's political art.\"He declined to speak further about future projects.Pavlensky is know for his performance art, including sewing his lips shut to protest Pussy Riot's detention. Pavlensky and de Taddeo were taken into custody Saturday and questioned over three days.  They have been placed under formal investigation for invasion of privacy and publishing images of a sexual nature without consent, according to a spokesman for the Paris prosecutor.Griveaux's lawyer, Richard Malka, told CNN via text he had \"no comment to make.\" But while withdrawing his candidacy on Friday last week, Griveaux said he and his family had endured \"defamatory statements, lies, rumors, anonymous attacks, the disclosure of private conversations that were stolen and death threats\" for over a year.\"Yesterday a new stage has been reached: a website, and social networks relayed vile attacks on my private life,\" he said in a televised statement Friday. \"My family does not deserve this.\" Griveaux did not deny that he had sent the explicit videos.Pavlensky: Griveaux would be a 'dangerous' mayorSeveral French politicians have lamented Griveaux's resignation. Current Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, who is running for re-election, called for the \"respect of privacy\" in a statement to CNN affiliate BFM TV. Pavlensky denied to CNN suggestions that he released the video out of jealousy over Griveaux and de Taddeo's former relationship.  He described the leak instead as an act of \"political art\" to inform Parisian voters that Griveaux had based his mayoral run on \"hypocrisy\" and \"lies.\"\"His private life stopped being private ... the moment he made his wife and children an integral part of his image and campaign,\" Pavlensky said.\"I can't say what could have happened if he had become mayor,\" he said. \"I think it would have been dangerous.\"Russian artist Pyotr Pavlensky speaks to the press as he leaves the Paris courthouse on February 18, 2020.Pavlensky is famous for his performance protests, including sewing his lips together over the imprisonment of Russian punk group Pussy Riot, who were jailed for a performance critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin. He also once nailed his scrotum to Moscow's Red Square.French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner told the radio station France Inter on Wednesday that if Pavlensky was convicted by French judges\u2014for the Griveaux leak - his status as a political refugee may be called into question.Pavlensky, though, said he wasn't scared of losing his refugee status and that he was used to such threats.\"I'm not thinking about it because in my life there has always been something meant to scare me. I'm used to it.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Scientists studying the remarkably well-preserved remains of an Ice Age bird have identified the specimen as a horned lark.Buried and frozen in permafrost near the village of Belaya Gora in north-eastern Siberia, the bird was discovered by local fossil ivory hunters, who passed it on to a team of experts, including Nicolas Dussex and Love Dal\u00e9n from the Swedish Museum of Natural History, for testing.Radiocarbon dating revealed the bird lived around 46,000 years ago, and genetic analysis identified it as a horned lark (Eremophila alpestris), according to a paper published Friday in the journal Communications Biology.Dal\u00e9n told CNN that research showed the bird may be an ancestor to two subspecies of lark alive today, one in northern Russia and the other on the Mongolian steppe.\"This finding implies that the climatic changes that took place at the end of the last Ice Age led to formation of new subspecies,\" he said.The bird was found in north-eastern Siberia at a site which also contained other frozen specimens.Read MoreThe preservation of the bird is explained in large part by the cold of the permafrost, explained Dussex, but this specimen is in extraordinarily good condition.\"The fact that such a small and fragile specimen was near intact also suggests that dirt/mud must have been deposited gradually, or at least that the ground was relatively stable so that the bird's carcass was preserved in a state very close to its time of death,\" said Dussex.The next stage of research involves sequencing the bird's entire genome, said Dal\u00e9n, which will reveal more about its relationship to present day subspecies and estimate the rate of evolutionary change in larks.Is it a dog or is it a wolf? 18,000-year-old frozen puppy leaves scientists baffledScientists working in the area have also found carcasses and body parts from other animals such as wolves, mammoths and wooly rhinos.Dussex described such findings as \"priceless\" as they allow researchers to retrieve DNA and sometimes RNA, a nucleic acid present in all living cells.\"This in turn will open new opportunities to study the evolution of ice age fauna and understand their responses to climate change over the past 50-10 thousands of years ago,\" added Dussex.The horned lark was discovered at the same site as an 18,000-year-old frozen puppy, which Dal\u00e9n and Dussex are also studying.Using carbon dating on the creature's rib bone, experts were able to confirm that the specimen had been frozen for around 18,000 years, but extensive DNA tests have so far been unable to show whether the animal was a dog or a wolf.Scientists can normally tell the difference relatively easy, and researchers hope that further tests on the remains will provide more insight into exactly when dogs were domesticated.",

No clear successor has emerged from the process to lead the country. Varadkar said he would stay on as caretaker leader after he tenders his resignation to Irish President Michael D. Higgins.Ireland had been in political deadlock since general elections on February 8 ended with no single party winning a mandate to govern. On Thursday, newly elected representatives in parliament voted on candidates for the next taoiseach, equivalent to a prime minister. Sinn Fein surged in Ireland's election. Here's why that's so controversialThe winner would have needed 80 votes to take the top seat.Incumbent Varadkar won just 36, with support from all lawmakers in his own party Fine Gael, plus one more. Fine Gael currently leads a minority government propped up in a confidence-and-supply arrangement with republican party Fianna F\u00e1il. Read MoreMiche\u00e1l Martin, the Fianna F\u00e1il candidate, received 41 votes. He could potentially end up leading the country if he can gain the support of Fine Gael.It was Mary Lou McDonald, leader of the republican Sinn Fein party, who won the most votes, gaining 45. But both Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il have ruled out a coalition or partnership with Sinn Fein, which was historically the political wing of the IRA. Earlier in the month, Sinn Fein managed to attract a historic level of support in the general election by campaigning on a platform to address problems with housing affordability and issues with the healthcare system.Varadkar was elected leader of Fine Gael in 2017, in a historic vote that propelled the former doctor to become the country's first openly gay taoiseach, as well as its youngest and the first with an ethnic minority background.He was seen as a symbol of a fast-liberalizing Ireland, overseeing the country's relaxation of its strict anti-abortion laws just years after Ireland legalized same-sex marriage.CNN's Sarah Dean contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Berlin (CNN)A gunman suspected of killing nine people at two shisha bars in Germany is believed to have a far-right background, prosecutors said Thursday,  sparking outrage across the country as it grapples with the rise of rightwing extremism.The attack took place on Wednesday night at multiple locations in the city of Hanau, near Frankfurt. Federal prosecutors are treating the mass shooting -- one of the deadliest in Germany in years -- as an act of terrorism.Authorities believe the suspect, 43, returned home after the rampage and shot himself. He was found dead in his apartment early Thursday, along with the body of his 72-year-old mother. Both died from gunshot wounds, according to the region's interior minister, Peter Beuth. Chancellor Angela Merkel said the suspect appeared to have acted out of \"right-wing extremist, racist motives\" and described hatred as a poison in German society. Prosecutors said the suspect did not have a criminal record but had posted xenophobic conspiracy theories online.      Shooting spree at shisha barsRead MoreThe rampage began around 10 p.m. and appears to have centered around two shisha bars in immigrant areas of the city. After opening fire at the Midnight shisha bar, the suspect then fled by car to the Arena Bar and Cafe, where the attack continued.Shisha bars, or flavored tobacco bars, first started in the city's Turkish community, and in recent years have become popular among young German people.Kadir Koese, a 38-year businessman who runs a bar across from one of the bars that was attacked, said he heard shots being fired. \"There was a guy lying on the sidewalk, shot in the head, I think. My neighbor said 'get down'. The police came quickly,\" he told Reuters.Can-Luca Frisenna, whose family members run one of the bars that came under attack, said he rushed to the scene after hearing about the shooting.\"I heard my father was affected and my little brother, they run the kiosk,\" Frisenna told Reuters. \"They were horrified and they were crying and everything. So everyone was shocked.\"Police officers guard the entrance of a bar where several people were killed late Wednesday in Hanau, Germany.Turkey called the shooting a \"racist attack\" and said five of its citizens were among the dead. German authorities have not yet publicly confirmed the nationalities of the victims, but prosecutors said the victims' ages ranged from 21 to 44, and that both foreign and German nationals were killed. Six others were injured in the attacks, one of them seriously.The suspect left a confession letter and a video, according to CNN affiliate RTL, citing police. His apartment was blocked off and searched by special forces, and police said there were no indications that other perpetrators were involved. Officials said the suspect's father was \"met unharmed\" by police, but didn't elaborate on where he was found or whether he was arrested.While the police only named the shooter as Tobias R., they also released information about his place and date of birth. Those details match what a man called Tobias Rathjen published on his personal website.Federal prosecutor Peter Frank told reporters that the website of the alleged killer contained a \"kind of manifesto\" that included \"confused thoughts\", \"conspiracy theories\", and displayed a \"deeply racist attitude\". The website has been taken down.YouTube said it shut down the account of a man named Tobias Rathjen on Thursday morning. The most recent video, which was uploaded on February 14, linked to Rathjen's personal website. The suspect had a legal gun license, Beuth said. According to Germany's national firearms register, there were 5.7 million privately-owned guns and 1.5 million gun owners as of 2015. A screengrab of suspect Tobias Rathjen'Our warnings were ignored'In the wake of the shootings, Germany's Foreign Minister Heiko Maas condemned the spread of right-wing attacks.\"If the suspicion is confirmed, the gruesome act in Hanau is the third extreme right-wing murder attack in Germany in a year,\" he said. \"Right-wing terrorism has again become a threat to our country.  There is absolutely nothing to put into perspective.\"Recent far-right attacks in Germany June 2019: Pro-migrant mayor, Walter L\u00fcbcke, is shot dead on the terrace of his home in the small village of Istha, in central Germany, by a far-right supporter.October 2019: Two people are killed in a shooting spree in the town of Halle -- one outside a synagogue and one at a nearby kebab shop, on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.February 2020: Nine people killed at two shisha bars in the town of Hanau by a gunman with extremist links.In October, a gunman killed two people in an attack on a synagogue in Halle, while streaming the rampage live from a camera on his helmet. He later admitted to the attack and to holding anti-Semitic and far-right views.Germany's Islamic Association claimed that Muslims were the gunman's \"target group.\"\"Before this right-wing terror we had been warning and demanding for weeks and months to take a clear stand against right-wing agitation and Islamophobia,\" its statement said. \"We had also warned that terror threatens us all -- Muslims and non-Muslims alike. Our warnings were ignored. The terror has struck. It is now the time to stand together.\"Merkel, who canceled a planned trip to the city of Halle in the wake of the attack, said the evidence overwhelmingly pointed to extremist motives.\"It is still too early for a final evaluation. Everything is being done to clear up the background of these horrible murders to the last detail. But at present there is much evidence that the perpetrator acted out of right-wing extremist, racist motives -- out of hatred against people of other origins, other beliefs or other outward appearances,\" Merkel said from Berlin. Forensic experts work around a damaged car after the attack in Hanau.\"Racism is a poison, hatred is a poison,\" Merkel added. \"I think now especially of the families and friends of the murdered. None of us can measure the suffering that the perpetrators brought upon them. I mourn with them and express my deepest sympathy.\"The far-right Alternative for Germany party said it was \"shaken by this terrible act.\" \"We believe that it is in the interests of the relatives of the victims if the crime and its background are clarified quickly,\" it added in a statement.The regional parliament in Hesse, the state where Hanau is located, suspended all sessions Thursday. A vigil for the victims in Hanau on Thursday evening turned into an impromptu protest against extremism, with some attendees carrying signs denouncing racism and xenophobia.

It is an intriguing one for newly installed coach Farrell, whose son Owen captains England. He also spent four years as the English defence coach before joining the Ireland setup. \"Like every other time that we play England at Twickenham, it's a big challenge, isn't it?\" Farrell told the Irish rugby website. \"Everyone knows that but top players, they relish these moments. We're in a good place, we're building well ... we're brimming at the minute and we can't wait for the challenge ahead.\"In the weekend's other fixtures, Italy takes on Scotland -- the tournament's only two sides without a win so far -- while Wales faces France in Cardiff. After an opening defeat by France, England bounced back with a 13-6 victory over Scotland. Ireland wrapped up the Six Nations grand slam during its last visit to Twickenham two years ago.

The inquiry does not appear to focus specifically on the government's climate policy, concentrating instead on \"practical action\" to improve Australia's preparedness for natural disasters and future bushfire seasons as the climate becomes more extreme, according to the terms of reference released on Thursday. \"My priority is to keep Australians safe and to do that, we need to learn from the Black Summer bushfires how nationally we can work better with the states and territories to better protect and equip Australians for living in hotter, drier and longer summers,\" the Prime Minister said.Since September, Australia has been battling its worst wildfires in decades, exacerbated by a prolonged drought and record temperatures. More than 18 million hectares (44 million acres) of bush, land and forest have been burned. At least 28 people have died and around 3,000 homes have been destroyed.Scientists have unequivocally linked the bushfires to human-induced climate change, and are calling on Australia's leaders and policymakers to take \"genuine concerted action to reduce global emissions of greenhouse gases.\" Australia's climate crisis has been building for years but no one listenedRead MoreIn a press conference announcing the commission on Thursday, Morrison said the inquiry \"acknowledges climate change, the broader impact of our summers getting longer, drier and hotter and is focused on practical action that has a direct link to making Australians safer.\"\"That's why we need to look at what actions should be taken to enhance our preparedness, resilience and recovery through the actions of all levels of government and the community, for the environment we are living in,\" he said. The commission will be tasked with examining, \"Australia's arrangements for improving resilience and adapting to changing climatic conditions.\" It will also look at what needs to be done to mitigate the impacts of natural disasters.The main focus of the inquiry will be on improving coordination between state and federal governments on preparedness, recovery, resilience, and hazard reduction measures. In a statement, Oxfam Australia's Chief Executive Lyn Morgain said the commission was a \"missed opportunity to reset Australia's climate policies\" and the focus was \"on the symptoms and not the causes.\"\"Oxfam Australia is therefore disappointed that the Commission has not been asked to look into Australia's contribution to the global climate crisis, and will be focused more narrowly on adaptation, resilience and response measures,\" Morgain said. Also part of the inquiry is whether the law needs to be changed to clarify which level of government is responsible for responding to disasters. Establishing new federal government powers to declare a national state of emergency and deploying the military during natural disasters will also be investigated. On Thursday, Morrison said calling out the military to help fight the fires was a \"constitutional gray zone.\"JUST WATCHEDHeaviest rain in 30 years puts out bushfiresReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHeaviest rain in 30 years puts out bushfires 00:51\"Currently, there are no such powers and federal responses are supposed to only be undertaken in response to state requests and authorizations,\" he said. The formation of the royal commission comes as public outrage over the fires has been mounting, with much of the anger directed at Morrison and his alleged inaction over the climate crisis.Morrison was accused of initially playing down the severity of the bushfires and was widely criticized for refusing to directly link the bushfires to the climate crisis.The prime minister has since defended his government's response and set up a National Bushfire Recovery Agency to coordinate the response to rebuilding communities.His administration has allocated 2 billion Australian dollars ($1.4 billion) in federal aid, to help rebuild vital infrastructure like schools and health facilities struck by fire.The royal commission into the bushfires is one of several set up on a range of issues in Australia in recent years. Some have questioned their value, saying they are expensive, rushed, and the recommendations often not implemented, according to ABC News.",

        "content": "(CNN)Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised anymore, given the frequency with which he does it.But for somebody so young and relatively inexperienced, Erling Braut Haaland's goalscoring record continues to boggle the mind.It's not just the goals but the way he scores them, too, and the way he contributes to the team as a whole.His latest victim was Paris Saint-Germain as two more goals -- the second of which would have made a rocket look sluggish -- gave Borussia Dortmund a deserved 2-1 win on home soil in the round of 16 first leg.The $457 million goalRead MoreMost had expected goals, goals, goals in this match but at half-time a stale encounter had barely provided even a clear-cut chance, much less troubled the scoreboard.Jadon Sancho was the star of the opening 45 minutes, turning PSG defenders inside and out with some dazzling footwork, but Haaland stole the show in the second period.After some slick build up play Dortmund, Raphael Guerreiro's shot in the box was deflected and Haaland reacted quicker than four PSG defenders and goalkeeper Keylor Navas to prod the loose ball into the roof of the net.READ: Erling Braut Haaland has 'potential to be an incredibly great player,' says Salzburg coachREAD: Teen sensation Erling Braut H\u00e5land scores debut hat-trick to save Borussia DortmundErling Braut Haaland performs his trademark meditation celebration.All of a sudden, the noise inside Signal Iduna Park, which had just started to bubble with frustrated groans, exploded as Dortmund got the goal its efforts in the opening 69 minutes truly deserved.But the atmosphere remained at fever pitch for a mere six minutes as the two most expensive players in football history combined to give PSG an equalizer from nothing.Kylian Mbappe's searing pace left Dortmund's defenders in a crumpled heap on the floor behind him and his ball into the box allowed Neymar a simple tap in.At that moment, the $457 million PSG had spent on the two players was looking worth every cent.'Little bit crazy'However, just two minutes after the PSG pair had left Signal Iduna Park in stunned silence, the roof almost lifted off as Dortmund regained the lead once again.It was another teenage sensation who created the goal, 17-year-old Giovanni Reyna -- son of former USMNT international Claudio Reyna -- spinning on the ball in midfield and driving towards goal.Haaland took one touch to control Reyna's pass before rifling a thunderous effort into the roof of the net.Such was the power with which he hit the ball, Navas didn't even bother stretching out his arms to attempt a save; he knew it was unstoppable.Erling Braut Haaland is mobbed after scoring the winner.Today's brace means Haaland has now scored 11 goals in his first seven games for Borussia Dortmund since his January transfer.The Norwegian wonderkid also rewrites the Champions League history books by becoming the fastest player to reach 10 goals in the competition, taking just seven games to reach the milestone.\"He's a great, great footballer, he scores really well -- and he's also a great guy and a little bit crazy, he's funny,\" a beaming Emre Can told BT Sport after the match. \"Hopefully he will continue like that.\"PSG defenders, conversely, will be hoping he doesn't.",

So, it's good to see that we're able to commit to each other and collect attention from new people.\"Read MoreREAD: How a remote desert is powering the electric vehicle revolution Livia Cevolini is pioneering electric motorcycling and women in motorsport.'Fan favorites'Cevolini founded Energica in 2014, aged just 36, in her home town of Modena, Italy's motor racing heartland.The company counts the likes of Ferrari, Lamborghini, Maserati, and fellow two-wheeled manufacturer Ducati as neighbors, and its racing heritage runs deep. While she studied engineering, Cevolini interned with the Ferrari F1 team. Giancarlo Minardi, founder of the Minardi F1 team -- which he eventually sold to Red Bull -- is a company director.  Energica's engineering pedigree also takes in the space industry, as well as motorcycle racing -- CTO Giampiero Testoni worked with both the Fantic MotoGP team and CRP Racing. Cevolini accepts that some bike purists may remain reluctant to accept MotoE, but sees it as a natural progression for racing.\"Electric bike racing has to face the obstacles that any change in racing brought in terms of acceptance and recognition,\" she told CNN. \"We have seen it many times in motorcycle racing already, with the changes from two-stroke to four-stroke engines (500cc to MotoGP) and with the introduction of Moto3 and Moto2 categories. \"All of these have emerged through time as fan-favorites, and MotoE will do just the same.\" READ: 'Your body is the limit to how fast, not the car'Cevolini sits on one of her company's Energica motorcycles.PotentialThe technical challenges for the development of the category are already falling away, she believes. \"In our first year we were able to match the Moto3 times on more than one occasion -- which is an incredible achievement,\" she said. \"So more than obstacles, I see potential in the near future.\"MotoE has proven its worth as a series already, Cevolini believes: \"The motorcycles are all the same, so there are big battles. They're having a lot of fun, both the riders and the public.\"  She added: \"People are changing quickly their minds.  So even if we think that it's slow, it's not so slow.

Its order backlog for 2020 is already equal to 40 percent of its entire 2019 revenue, it claims. \"We are a relatively small and young company with a clear identity and a great mission,\" Cevolini says. \"We are already seeing the benefits on our involvement in MotoE in terms of visibility and technology developed on track.\" Growth, she believes, will be organic. \"We are pioneering electric motorcycling in an organic way,\" she says. \"So, in five years I see Energica as a well-established institution with a global reach, and a brand that is recognized as a history-making manufacturer in electric motorcycling.\" The comparisons to Tesla founder Musk are flattering, Cevolini smiles. \"It is obviously an honor to be associated to Elon Musk, someone who has changed the game and revolutionized the car industry,\" she says. \"We want to lead by example as much as he did, but also do it our own way: car and motorcycle industries have some things in common, but also many differences.\"READ: Shark-fin styling for new Formula E carJUST WATCHEDExtreme E is the 'future of off-road racing'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHExtreme E is the 'future of off-road racing' 02:50Ferrari hero She does however, have a male role model from closer to home.\"Being from Modena, and the fact that Energica dug its roots in the Italian motor valley, I can't help but look up to Enzo Ferrari: a true 'agitator of men' -- as he used to define himself,\" she says. As a female CEO in an industry notoriously dominated by men, Cevolini admits she has faced challenges.  She told CNN it was difficult to be taken seriously when she founded the company.  \"It still is difficult,\" she says.  \"Things are changing, but I think it's also a push for ourselves as women in the technological world, and male world, to be better than them.\" That need to \"be better\" than her male counterparts has been a motivation, and even an advantage, she believes.  \"There are more and more women that are passionate about motors -- and showing that they can be very good at the business level,\" she says. \"It is important to demonstrate that, as a woman, you are as good as a man, or even better -- and once you do, surely this becomes an advantage.

But the change isn't confined to the track, according to Cevolini. \"Actually, I've seen more and more engineers, female engineers in our world, in the paddocks, in the racing world, in the industrial world, so things are changing,\" she says. Cevolini's advice to other women aspiring to enter the world of motors and motorsport is simple: \"Go for it. Do your job, take your studies very seriously and choose something you really like. Be always prepared and ready. Invest in your career. Don't look at the others and don't necessarily do what 'you're supposed to'.\" As MotoE prepares for pre-season testing in Jerez next month, the Italian sees a bright future for sustainable sport. \"We have to change our world... we have to commit to our planet with the right technology, because (sustainable sport) has to be anyway fun. So, it's so important,\" she says.  \"This is the right time.\"",

If the reptiles get too cold they may be unable to feed or move as normal, and their immune system may cease to function properly, leaving them vulnerable to disease.Snakes also made headlines in the US last week after a park in the Florida was closed to the public due to a water snake orgy.

        "content": "London (CNN)A recently hired adviser to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has resigned, after backlash grew against his controversial past comments -- notably for claims that black Americans have lower IQs than white Americans and that compulsory contraception could prevent the creation of a \"permanent underclass.\" Andrew Sabisky, a self-described \"superforecaster,\" announced his resignation as a \"contractor\" on Twitter Monday, saying that he did not want the \"media hysteria about my old stuff online\" to be a distraction for Johnson's government. \"I know this will disappoint a lot of ppl but I signed up to do real work, not be in the middle of a giant character assassination: if I can't do the work properly there's no point, & I have a lot of other things to do w/ my life,\" he said in another tweet. Hey all,The media hysteria about my old stuff online is mad but I wanted to help HMG not be a distraction. Accordingly I've decided to resign as a contractor. I hope no.10 hires more ppl w/ good geopolitical forecasting track records & that media learn to stop selective quoting\u2014 Andrew Sabisky (@AndrewSabisky) February 17, 2020\n\nThe 27-year-old was hired by Johnson's most senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, who advertised earlier this year for \"weirdos and misfits with odd skills\" to work alongside him.Critics of the appointment singled out past comments made by Sabisky in support of eugenics and giving children mind-enhancing drugs for their educational benefits. \"From a societal perspective the benefits of giving everyone modafinil once a week are probably worth a dead kid once a year,\" he said in a 2016 interview. Read MoreIn a 2014 comment on Cummings' website, Sabisky wrote: \"One way to get around the problems of unplanned pregnancies creating a permanent underclass would be to legally enforce universal uptake of long-term contraception at the onset of puberty.\"\"Vaccination laws give it a precedent, I would argue.\"In a post on another website in 2014, he also suggested that black Americans have a lower average IQ than their white counterparts.At the daily briefing for UK political journalists on Monday, a government spokesman repeatedly refused to say whether Johnson shared Sabisky's views on eugenics, the selective breeding of humans. \"The Prime Minister's views on a range of subjects are well-publicized and documented,\" the spokesman said, according to the PA Media news agency.Monday was the first time Sabisky commented on his past writings since they were revealed by the UK's Times newspaper on Saturday, save to retweet the Times article. Johnson had faced calls from his own side to ditch Sabisky. \"Cannot believe No 10 has refused to comment on  Andrew Sabisky. I don't know him from a bar of soap, but don't think we'd get on,\" wrote a Conservative MP, Caroline Noakes, on Twitter. \"Must be no place in Government for the views he's expressed,\" she said.Britain finally admits that Brexit means the death of frictionless trade with EuropeSince Johnson entered Downing Street last summer, his opponents have been concerned at the influence Cummings would have over the government. Critics say that Cummings,  widely considered to have been the mastermind behind the successful 2016 Brexit campaign, has a brutal political style and fear that he is willing to run over anyone who stands in the way of his radical political agenda. Former colleagues say that he is a \"Grade-A political rottweiler\" and that \"everyone who is on the opposing side should be astonishingly frightened.\"Cummings has a developed a reputation for being a political outsider, interested in ideas that are not usually discussed in Westminster circles. Between the 2016 referendum and his appointment to Downing Street, Cummings wrote long blog posts on topics such as artificial intelligence and reforming entire political systems. Cummings' status after Brexit meant that his website became widely read in the British political world.Cummings placed the \"Weirdos and misfits\" advert on his personal blog, encouraging his readers to apply via a gmail account rather than an official government address. Supporters of Cummings say that even if he knew of Sabisky's previous comments, it's unlikely it would reflect his own views. However, friends of Cummings say they were not surprised someone with these views would end up on his radar: \"To Dom a lot of this stuff is a discussion point, or philosophical banter,\" one friend told CNN. Opposition lawmakers do not buy this argument. Chris Bryant, a Labour MP, worried prior to Sabisky's resignation that the contractor had been \"hired because of these views, not despite them.\" \"The first steps towards a really right-right wing government which tramples on normal fundamentals of democracy often starts with baby steps.\"",

CNN has contacted ITV for comment; it said in a previous statement it was \"shocked and saddened\" by Flack's death.In one segment of each series, contestants are read mocking tweets posted by members of the public. A handful of its stars have discussed receiving online criticism after leaving the show.A former contestant, Eyal Booker, told CNN last year that the show encourages a culture of judgment. Several contestants have felt the wrath of social media for their choices in the villa -- to the extent that one, Joe Garratt, reportedly was placed into a safe house after being dumped from the show.ITV has said it has boosted its duty-of-care processes, including offering \"enhanced psychological support.\"Several of Flack's friends and peers have defended the show. Laura Whitmore, Flack's friend and replacement as \"Love Island\" host said on her BBC radio show the day after her death: \"Caroline loved to love. That's all she wanted. Which is why a show like Love Island was important to her, because the show is about finding love, friendship, having a laugh. The problem wasn't the show.\"Rob Picheta contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)What started with claims in a German magazine has resulted in Manchester City being banned from European club competitions for two seasons and fined $32.5 million. UEFA's decision to punish the reigning English Premier League champion after it found the club had committed \"serious breaches\" of the European governing body's club licensing and financial fair play regulations has led to shock, denial and plenty of questions. Manchester City banned from upcoming UEFA competitionsThe punishment is subject to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, and City immediately issued a statement Friday describing UEFA's process as \"flawed\" and making it clear the fight is not over. But how did it come to this and what now for one of the world's richest football clubs and its manager Pep Guardiola? In November 2018, German magazine Der Spiegel reported that City and its sponsors manipulated contracts to circumvent UEFA's Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules, introduced in 2011 to stop clubs overspending. Read MoreLeaked emails obtained by Der Spiegel from the Football Leaks organization suggested City's Abu Dhabi owners had paid the club directly rather than Etihad, which is the club's shirt sponsor and has naming rights for its stadium. Der Spiegel, citing club documents, alleged the airline financed only part of the sponsorship deal, with the owners coming up with the rest.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosGuardiola's current contract with Man City ends in 2021. FFP rules state clubs can only lose $32 million over three seasons otherwise they will be liable to a fine or suspension. Last March UEFA began its investigation and in May the case was referred to UEFA's financial watchdog, the financial control body adjudicatory chamber (CFCB), with City filing an appeal to CAS in June, which was rejected in November 2019. On Friday, CFCB said City had broken the rules and, significantly, \"failed to cooperate in the investigation.\" In its statement, City said the emails had been taken out of context and the case had been \"initiated by UEFA, prosecuted by UEFA and judged by UEFA.\" In the immediate aftermath, the future of Guardiola, widely regarded as the finest manager of his era, has been the main focus. The former Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach has previously maintained he would remain at City at least until his contract expires in 2021. Under Guardiola's leadership, City has broken records and played mesmerizing football. Man City has won back-to-back league titles. In winning the EPL in 2017-18, City became the first English club to record a 100-point haul. And in successfully defending the league title and securing the FA Cup and League Cup last season, the club became the first to win all three domestic trophies in a single campaign. But in his four years in Manchester, one trophy has eluded him, which was the main reason he was brought to the club -- the Champions League, the richest competition in European football. Only last week Guardiola talked of how he might be sacked if he does not win European football's top prize soon. That statement may have been overdramatic, but if UEFA's decision is upheld, Guardiola needs to win the Champions League this season or likely face never winning the trophy he covets the most with City. Will Guardiola be happy to wait until 2023 to restart his Champions League quest with City? By the end of his present contract, he will have stayed at City longer than at any of his previous clubs. And with unprecedented heights already scaled on the domestic front, many are asking what would motivate him to stay. Could this be the end of an era for Manchester City?Even before Friday's seismic punishment,  it had become clear City would have to rebuild in the summer. With Liverpool currently 22 points ahead of City in the league, the club needs an injection of players if it is to reclaim its position as the dominant team in England. Veteran midfielder David Silva is to leave at the end of the season. It is uncertain whether striker Sergio Aguero, City's all-time leading scorer, will remain beyond his current deal, which ends in 2021. Young forward Leroy Sane is also being heavily linked with a move to Bayern Munich. If Guardiola leaves, so could a number of other stars. Raheem Sterling and Kevin de Bruyne are in long-term deals, but they will want to test themselves against the best. With rich owners, money is not a problem for City -- but without the prestige of Champions League football, will City still be able to attract elite players? UEFA's punishment has shaken City. It could also lead to an end of an era.",

        "content": "Paris, France (CNN)There was a sense of urgency in the voice of the man claiming to be France's defense minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian. \"We're talking about the lives of French citizens and we would like to free them. If we don't, we expect the worst,\" the man said in an audio recording of a telephone solicitation obtained by CNN. \"I need to know if you can join us in this mission so we can carry it out and if the answer is 'yes' then I will alert the presidency to say we have someone who can act as a mediator for us.\" On the receiving end of the telephone line was Olivier de Boisset, a Frenchman who heads an IT company in Niger.De Boisset was being asked to wire over 2 million dollars to allegedly help free French hostages being held by terrorists in Mali.Read MoreThe voice said France needed de Boisset's help transferring funds because officially the country does not pay ransoms and gave assurances that France's central bank would reimburse him.Many high-profile individuals were duped by the scammers.De Boisset was suspicious, but he could never have imagined the extent of the scam that was being played on him.Not only were there no French hostages in Mali, but he had just become the latest victim in a multi-million dollar con that would span two years and target more than 150 people including the spiritual leader Aga Khan, the President of Niger, the Prime Minister of Norway, the Archbishop of Lyon, the owner of Chateau Margaux wines, the King of Belgium, the director general of UNESCO and numerous CEOs.Attempts to extort money from embassies and governments were made in more than 50 countries, according to French court documents.CNN has obtained exclusive recordings made by often-skeptical victims showing how a group of fraudsters tried to pull off what some in France are calling the scam of the century by impersonating France's then defense minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, and conning wealthy individuals out of 80 million euros purportedly to help pay ransoms to free French hostages being held by Islamist terrorists.Some of the money has not been recovered.Six of the alleged fraudsters are currently on trial in Paris in connection with the Le Drian hoax and a plot to impersonate Prince Albert II of Monaco while a seventh defendant is on trial only for the Albert of Monaco plot. The con was elaborateAccording to many of the victims, to earn their trust an initial phone call was followed up by a Skype video call. During this exchange, the con artist wore a custom-made silicone mask of Le Drian's face and sat in a replica of the minister's office complete with both the tricolor flag of France and a flag of Europe, pictures in the court documents show.Another one of those targeted in June 2016 by the bogus Le Drian was Bruno Paillard, who heads a champagne house in Reims, northern France.Paillard told CNN the hustle was impressive because of its elaborate nature. \"The image was not very precise and the voice was a little bit strange. The excuse was that they were in a bunker in the ministry,\" Paillard said.In addition to the Skype calls, Paillard said they communicated with him on official-looking letterheads from the ministry, but despite all their efforts Paillard said he wasn't convinced and went straight to the police. \"As a champagne producer we make people happy, but we're not necessarily good at saving the lives of people who are being held in strange countries,\" Paillard told CNN.Paillard said the fake Le Drian had done his homework, he even knew how many children he had.Wine maker Guy-Petrus Lignac was equally astonished at how much the fraudsters knew about him. He said they drew on his background to appeal to his sense of patriotism.  Man arrested at Indian airport for impersonating Lufthansa pilot\"They knew so many things about me! That I had been a police officer in the past. That's not common knowledge, it's not on the internet. I was surprised,\" Lignac told CNN. Many of the victims were skeptical and went to the defense ministry to report the calls. The ministry alerted investigators in the summer of 2015 and an investigation was opened in April 2016, according to court documents.Lawyers for Le Drian said French embassies all over the world were warned of the scam in 2016. However, the ministry didn't see the need for a press conference. Authorities opened an investigation but the con continuedTurkish businessman Inan Kirac, was duped in November 2016 and over the course of one month handed over $47 million in nine transfers to bank accounts in China -- the largest sum to be wired to the fraudsters by one individual.Kirac eventually realized he was being scammed and began taping the conversations.In an audio recording obtained by CNN Kirac is heard speaking with a man impersonating an aide to Le Drian.\"Mr. Kirac, first of all, I wanted to express my condolences concerning the attack in Istanbul and I learned that two of your very close friends were injured in this attack,\" the voice on the crackly line is heard saying.\"I hope that 2016 will be a good year to defeat crime and the terrorists who deserve to go to hell,\" the man said.Kirac believed his money was being used to free two French journalists who were allegedly being held hostage in Syria.Delphine Meillet, the lawyer representing the actual Le Drian, who is now France's foreign minister, told CNN the fraudsters used the war in Syria to their advantage. \"There were real hostages at the time, in 2015, and the technique to convince them was to play on fears of terrorism,\" Meillet said.\"When the state asks you to do it a favor, to help fight terrorism, how can you say no? How can you say no to a minister?\" she added.Scammers who posed as George Clooney arrested in ThailandThe voice of the fake Le Drian is allegedly that of Gilbert Chikli, according to prosecutors, a Franco-Israeli accused of being the mastermind behind the sting. He is charged with organized fraud and usurping a person's identity. Chikli denies the charges.Meillet describes the 54-year-old as being a modern-day Victor Lustig, the notorious con man who sold the Eiffel Tower to a scrap-metal dealer in 1925, not once but twice.Chikli has a checkered past. In 2015, he was sentenced in absentia to seven years in prison for a brazen scam where he posed as prominent French CEOs in order to extort millions of euros from companies. The hoax was later the subject of a movie \"Thank You for Calling\" that paid Chikli as a consultant, according to court documents. In 2017 the Parisian was arrested in Ukraine and according to court documents evidence was found on Chikli's cell phone showing that Google searches for \"silicone mask Kiev\" and \"Prince of Monaco\" had been made.\"The real Jean-Yves Le Drian: \"You can't impersonate me, if you do then you go to prison,\" the defense minister said last year.Another defendant in the trial, Anthony Lasarevitsch, was arrested in Kiev alongside Chikli. Investigators found pictures of a silicone mask of Prince Albert II of Monaco on his cell phone.Lasarevitsch faces the same charges as Chikli, and denies any wrongdoing. His lawyer said in court that Lasarevitsch had been \"dragged into the case by the media\" after his arrest alongside Chikli \"was broadcast to the masses.\"A clip of Chikli, while incarcerated in Kiev, surfaced on social media in 2017 showing him having a fridge delivered to the prison. In the video Chikli says \"this is what I've bought, a fridge, so I can eat some entrecote. We are the bosses!\"Chikli was eventually extradited to France. He is currently in prison serving time for the CEO hoax. He's admitted taking part in the CEO scam but says he's not the mastermind.On Monday experts testified that the voice of the fake Le Drian bore a striking resemblance to that of Chikli.Chikli defended himself vehemently in court Monday.\"What can I tell you? They've got it wrong!\" he shouted.  \"There are 20 billion cases like this per year, I've got nothing to do with this! I have no answers to your questions,\" Chikli growled.His lawyer, Stephane Sebag, told CNN that the whole of the prosecution was based on weak analysis of the voice samples from Chikli's interviews and that the recordings of the scam \"are very poor.\"\"This is not enough to convince anyone of his guilt,\" Sebag said.If convicted Chikli faces up to 14 years in prison and a 2 million euro fine. A verdict is expected on March 11.The real Le Drian reacted to the scam last year. \"You can't impersonate me, if you do then you go to prison,\" he said.\"They were pretty convincing and sadly there were victims. They did a good job of imitating my voice,\" Le Drian added.  Fanny Bobille contributed to this report.",

        "content": "London (CNN)Like any institution, monarchies must adapt to remain relevant and in place.For the British royal family, that has meant slimming down to reflect more austere times -- as demonstrated by the ever-decreasing numbers appearing on the palace balcony during national celebrations.The Queen's thinking was that those in the direct line of succession -- Princes Charles, William and George -- would retain the support of their siblings in carrying out their public duties, but not the many cousins that Elizabeth II and her predecessors were able to count on too.The issue for William is that he is one of only two siblings. Which is why his brother, Prince Harry, was always seen as integral to the monarchy -- the key burden-sharer of his generation.Who's who in the House of Windsor: Queen Elizabeth II's line of successionYou can imagine the shock then, when earlier this year Harry announced, apparently without notice, that he and his wife Meghan would be stepping back from public duties and setting up a new life in North America.Read MoreThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex's announcement wasn't just a personal loss for the family; it disrupted the entire structure, strategy and brand of the Crown, which is a key pillar of British democracy.All this at a time when the ageing head of state, Queen Elizabeth II, had been hoping to step back herself at the age of 93, allowing the next generation to pick up more of her duties.Ultimately, the departure of the Sussexes capped off a seismic 12 months that proved the British monarchy needed its Queen more than ever, firmly dispelling any suggestion that she might soon retire.A year of royal scandalThe first royal scandal of 2019 came in January when the Queen's husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, was involved in a car crash near Sandringham, the family's estate in Norfolk, eastern England. Prince Philip was unhurt when his Land Rover flipped onto its side, though a woman in the other car was injured.But when the 98-year-old duke -- who is rarely seen these days following his retirement in 2017 -- was spotted back behind the wheel the following day, there was a media furore.The situation went from bad to worse when it emerged that the victim had not been immediately contacted by Prince Philip in the days after the crash. An announcement that the elderly royal would give up his driving license followed swiftly -- no doubt following discussions with his wife.Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip during a State visit by the King and Queen of Spain in London, 2017. The Queen is mostly based at London's Buckingham Palace during the week. As royal commentator Richard Fitzpatrick explained: \"The Queen has been without her 'strength and stay' as [the duke] is based at Wood Farm on the Sandringham Estate [in Norfolk, 100 miles north of London], even though they reportedly speak every day by telephone.\"Fitzpatrick added that the absence of the long-time patriarch -- who previously assumed the roles of \"modernizer\" and \"pragmatist\" -- had been keenly felt this year.In the duke's absence, Prince Charles and his son Prince William -- also known by their official titles of the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge -- started accompanying the Queen more to engagements.It's all part of the inevitable transition to a new monarch. But abdication is dismissed out of hand by aides who point to the Queen's repeated commitments to \"life-long service.\"Even the idea of a regency -- where she retains the Crown but hands over all official responsibilities to Charles -- appears to be off the agenda.Sussexes dominate headlinesMeanwhile, another royal clash with the press was brewing.In March, a CNN investigation revealed the palace had beefed up its social media operation amid a rise in racist online abuse targeting the Duchess of Sussex. It has been devoting more resources to deleting comments targeting the duchess, blocking abusive accounts and filtering out use of the n-word along with gun and knife emojis.At the extreme end, a far-right teenager who reportedly branded Prince Harry a \"race traitor\" and suggested he should be shot after his marriage to Meghan. The teen was jailed for more than four years.Against this backdrop, the couple's battle with the British media escalated. When the palace revealed that millions of pounds of public money had been used to renovate Frogmore Cottage, the Sussexes' family home near Windsor Castle, newspapers complained they weren't getting fair access to the family, particularly after baby Archie's christening was closed to the media. Prince Harry and wife Meghan show their new son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor to Meghan's mother Doria Ragland, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, in May last year.The couple was also accused of hypocrisy for using private jets to fly off on holiday, while campaigning on environmental issues.In response, the pair went on the offensive over what Harry described as a tabloid campaign against Meghan that mirrored the treatment meted out to his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.The duchess sued the Mail on Sunday, alleging the tabloid had illegally published a private letter to her father, Thomas Markle. And the duke launched his own legal proceedings against the Daily Mirror and the Sun, over alleged phone-hacking.All publications deny the couple's claims and have vowed to fight them vigorously.When the Queen came to the throne in the 1950s, the media was more limited and reverential in tone. Since then, the media landscape has changed dramatically, and the intensified scrutiny on her family has taken a toll on its younger generations -- particularly the Sussexes.Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Queen Elizabeth II at the Queen's Young Leaders Awards Ceremony at Buckingham Palace in June, 2018.\"I never thought that this would be easy, but I thought that it would be fair,\" the duchess said of her treatment by the media, in a documentary for CNN affiliate ITV News, which aired in October.\"I've really tried to adopt this British sensibility of a stiff upper lip,\" she said. \"I tried, but I think what that does internally is probably really damaging.\"Asked how she was feeling, Meghan responded, \"Thank you for asking because not many people have asked if I'm okay, but it's a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.\"\"Not many people have asked if I'm ok ... it's a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.\"Meghan reveals to ITV's\u00a0@tombradby\u00a0the intense media spotlight has left her struggling to cope while becoming a mum #HarryAndMeghan https://t.co/Uy21iE6ozJ pic.twitter.com/kZqhZV66OL\u2014 ITV News (@itvnews) October 18, 2019\n\nThat comment was seen by some columnists as a slight directed at other royal family members that they haven't offered support.  And was compounded by Prince Harry's acknowledgment of tensions with his older brother Prince William, saying they are on \"different paths.\"After the program aired, a source at Kensington Palace told the BBC that the Duke of Cambridge was \"worried\" about his brother.That was followed up by a source close to the Sussexes telling CNN the couple are \"single-handedly modernising the monarchy,\" despite officials around them being \"afraid\" to harness their power.Rifts in the familyThis flood of leaks and counter-leaks fueled the tabloid narrative of a rift in the family. The rumours appeared to be confirmed when the Sussexes in January announced that they would be stepping back from their senior roles, splitting their time between the UK and North America with the intention of becoming financially independent.A source told CNN that the Queen had expressly asked Harry to hold off releasing any statements regarding the couple's future. Instead, her grandson blindsided the family by taking the somewhat nuclear option of going public, a move that reportedly \"upset\" Her Majesty.Queen appoints Prince William to new role amid royal shakeupThere followed a crisis meeting at The Queen's Sandringham Estate, involving the monarch and Princes Charles, William and Harry. In a statement issued after their talks, the Queen took on the tone of a grandmother, saying \"these are complex matters for my family to resolve.\"But she also had the firmness of a leader, making clear that while the Sussexes were still much-loved members of the family, they were no longer part of \"the firm,\" as it is known.Prince Andrew's disastrous interviewJust months earlier, the Queen's second son Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, also stepped back from public duties -- though this was more an act of damage control, than a lifestyle choice.It followed a disastrous extended interview with the BBC in November that was designed to clear up speculation about his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, but had precisely the opposite effect.Epstein had allegedly trafficked Virginia Giuffre -- previously known as Virginia Roberts -- when she was 17 years old, forcing her to have sex with his friends, including Prince Andrew.Prince Charles, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Andrew during the Queen's annual birthday parade, on June 08, 2019.While the duke denied having any sexual contact with Giuffre, he didn't appear to regret his relationship with Epstein -- who died by apparent suicide in August -- and failed to express any sympathy for the disgraced banker's victims.The fallout from the widely criticized interview dominated the tabloids for days, with reporters digging out inconsistencies in the duke's story. The situation descended into farce as pictures of a sweating Prince Andrew were dug out of the archives to undermine his claim that he didn't sweat at the time of the alleged offenses due to a medical condition.Days later, Prince Andrew said in a statement that he did regret his association with Epstein and sympathize with his victims. But the damage had already been done, and he stepped back from his royal role, following a meeting with the Queen.Multiple sources have made it clear to CNN that the Queen led on the issue of how to handle Andrew, just as she did during the Sussex crisis.Despite the duke saying he was willing to help US law enforcement officials with their investigation, authorities later claimed they had received \"zero\" cooperation from the royal.Political pressureAmid all her family woes, the Queen was also tested professionally when Prime Minister Boris Johnson asked her to suspend Parliament for five weeks at the height of the Brexit political deadlock.She rubber-stamped the request in line with her duty to stay out of politics and to act only on the advice of ministers.But when the Supreme Court found the prorogation was illegal, it raised the uncomfortable question of whether the Queen had broken the law.The ruling led to accusations that Johnson's government had deliberately misled the monarch as part of its strategy to secure Brexit -- but regardless, any political manoeuvre involving the Queen is the ultimate faux pas.Queen Elizabeth II welcomes then-newly elected leader of the Conservative party, Boris Johnson, in Buckingham Palace on July 24, 2019.Johnson was forced to personally apologize for embarrassing the monarch, according to the Sunday Times. The paper's royal sources revealed that \"there was huge disquiet in the Queen's household about Johnson's decision to prorogue parliament.\"The Queen famously described 1992 as her \"Annus Horribilis,\" when three of her children endured marital strife and Windsor Castle almost burned down. If that was the year she was tested personally, then the last 12 months are when she has been tested professionally.The monarchy is still intact but it needs time to recalibrate. Elizabeth will be hoping that it's allowed the time to do that, without any further disruption.She remains firmly at the helm. But part of that recalibration continues to be transitioning her heirs into their new roles.",

That was on display Friday when President Emmanuel Macron's candidate for Paris mayor pulled out of the race after it was alleged he sent explicit content to a woman who is not his wife.While withdrawing his candidacy on Friday, Benjamin Griveaux said he and his family have endured \"defamatory statements, lies, rumors, anonymous attacks, the disclosure of private conversations that were stolen and death threats\" for over a year.\"Yesterday a new stage has been reached: a website, and social networks relayed vile attacks on my private life,\" he said in a televised statement. \"My family does not deserve this.\" Griveaux did not deny that he had sent the explicit videos.France to limit access to Western Europe's highest mountain in conservation effortHis resignation enraged many in France -- including his political rivals -- who decried what they feared was an assault on France's liberal attitude to sex. Read More\"I do not like this Americanization of political life in which politicians come and apologize because they have a mistress, we don't care,\" Alexis Corbiere, a senior member of radical left-wing party \"France Insoumise\" told CNN affiliate BFM. S\u00e9bastien Chenu, a politician in Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally party, said the \"Americanization of political life is detestable,\" on Twitter, adding that nothing could be gained by its voyeuristic \"puritanism.\" Even the current mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo -- who is running for reelection -- called for the \"respect of privacy\" in a statement to BFM. \"This is not worthy of the democratic debate we should be having,\" she said. Art meets politicsRussian dissident artist Pyotr Pavlensky admitted to publishing the text messages and 30 second explicit video alleged to have been sent by Griveaux to the unidentified woman.  The content was published on a website, shared on Pavlensky's Facebook page, which invites users to send \"correspondence, photographs or videos\" of a sexual or pornographic nature sent by \"civil servants and political representatives\" who impose \"puritanism on society.\" Pavlensky is famous for his acts of protest, including sewing his lips together over the jailing of the Russian feminist protest punk band Pussy Riot -- for their part in a performance critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin -- and nailing his scrotum to Moscow's Red Square.  He justified the move as a way to reveal the hypocrisy of a candidate who espouses \"family values,\" Pavlensky told the French daily Liberation. \"He is someone who constantly relies on family values, who says that he wants to be the mayor of families and always quotes as an example his wife and children,\" he said. \"But he [Griveaux] wants to be the head of the city and he lies to the voters.\"France is no stranger to sex scandals, but its response to the extra-marital affairs of public figures contrasts with that of the United States or UK, where miscreants tend to face more public disapproval. In 2011, Anthony Weiner heeded calls from across the political spectrum by resigning from office as a Democratic congressman over a sexting scandal. That said, President Bill Clinton had an affair while in office and kept his job, and Donald Trump remains US President despite multiple accusations of extramarital affairs and sexual harassment allegations -- which he has repeatedly denied. In France, President Francois Hollande did not step down in 2014 after reports of his affair with a French actress spread like wildfire through the British and American press. Neither denied the affair. At the time, the French political establishment came to his defense, condemning the French edition of the tabloid, Closer, for breaking the story. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Matonti, a political science professor at Paris' Sorbonne University, told CNN that French public opinion has not traditionally been influenced by what politicians do in private.\"The press found it to be a political matter. But in fact, Hollande's ratings were not really impacted by it,\" Matonti said.Griveaux's former rival, and party, rallied around him on Friday. \"The outrageous attack on him is a serious threat to our democracy,\" Cedric Villani, who had left Macron's En March! party after it emerged Griveaux was the preferred candidate, wrote on Twitter. En Marche's Stanislas Guerini, condemned the \"appalling attack\" his colleague Griveaux and his family has faced. Griveaux's lawyer Richard Malka told CNN: \"Following the withdrawal of his candidacy as mayor of Paris, Mr. Benjamin Griveaux is asking for his privacy to be respected. Privacy is a fundamental right for everybody and the violation of privacy is condemned by the penal and civil codes. Mr. Benjamin Griveaux has asked us to start legal proceedings against any publications that infringe this right.\" But all of this does not mean France has suddenly become morally conservative, Eric Fassin, a sociologist who writes extensively on contemporary sexual politics in France and the US, told CNN.\"No one in the political or in the media sphere has been judging Griveaux on moral grounds. The reason why he dropped out has more to do with the embarrassment of dealing with these images as he is campaigning for city office,\" Fassin said.\"In politics, ridicule does kill.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)St. Louis Blues defenseman Jay Bouwmeester, who needed a defibrillator to be revived after suffering a cardiac episode on the team bench during a game, has undergone a successful Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) procedure, his team says.Blues President of Hockey Operations and General Manager Doug Armstrong announced Friday the procedure took place at University of California-Irvine Medical Center in Anaheim, California.Bouwmeester will be flown back to St. Louis once he is released by the UCI Cardiology Department. When he is back in Missouri, the 36-year-old two-time All-Star will be monitored by Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University physicians.The Blues say they will provide an update on Bouwmeester's status early next week.On Tuesday during the Blues' game against the Ducks in Anaheim, medical personnel used a defibrillator to revive Bouwmeester after the cardiac difficulty, which left him unresponsive on the team bench.Read MoreIn a video of the collapse, Bouwmeester can be seen slumped over on the bench before he eventually falls forward and his teammates call for help. The game was postponed.By the time he was transported to the hospital, Bouwmeester, whom Armstrong said regained consciousness immediately, was alert and able to move his extremities.Bouwmeester holds the longest streak of consecutive games played by a defenseman in the league's history -- playing 737 games between 2004 to 2014, according to the team's website. He ranks sixth all-time in total games played by any player.He was a part of Canada's gold medal-winning team at the Sochi Olympics in 2014, and won two golds and a silver medal from playing in the world championships.The NHL has said a decision on the date of the makeup game will be made in the near future. The contest will be a full game but the score will start at 1-1, as it was when the incident happened.CNN's Kevin Dotson contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)A Black Mamba-shaped shadow looms large over this year's NBA All-Star Weekend.It is less than a month since NBA legend Kobe Bryant -- as well as his daughter Gianna and seven others -- lost their lives in a helicopter crash in California's Calabasas on January 26.All-Star Weekends in the past have been fun and light-hearted, but this year's event will have a very different feel. The 2020 finalists for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame will be revealed at 5 p.m. ET on Friday, and Bryant will almost certainly be one of the names announced in his first year of eligibility.There undoubtedly will be laughs and smiles, but the weekend will be focused on commemorating Bryant and honoring his memory.Read MoreThe headline eventThe All-Star game itself will be played on Sunday at 8 p.m. ET. Like last year, the historical Eastern All-Stars v. Western All-Stars has been scrapped. The respective teams will be captained by the two players to have received the most All-Star votes: LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo, who take charge for the second year running.The 2020 #NBAAllStar #TeamLeBron & #TeamGiannis rosters as drafted by @KingJames and @Giannis_An34! pic.twitter.com/zV0w37TgDN\u2014 NBA (@NBA) February 7, 2020 The starting line-ups and reserves were selected in a draft not dissimilar from how teams might be picked in gym class or on a playground.Both James and Antetokounmpo picked their respective regular season teammates at first opportunity, and somehow you couldn't help but feel sorry for the last pick.As the weekend is being hosted in Chicago, both captains have selected a Chicago-based charity for which they will play for.Team LeBron will play for Chicago Scholars, a nonprofit leadership development organization that empowers academically ambitious students from under-resourced communities to complete college and become the next generation of leaders. Antetokounmpo has chosen After School Matters, a nonprofit organization that provides life-changing after-school and summer program opportunities to nearly 19,000 Chicago teenagers each year.Team Giannis will wear No. 24 and Team LeBron will wear No. 2 -- the respective jersey numbers worn by the late Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna.In the All-Star Game, Team Giannis will wear No. 24 and Team LeBron will wear No. 2 -- the respective jersey numbers of the late Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna.Competitive combatantThe rules of the game this year have been tweaked as well.Each quarter acts as a mini-game, with the winner of each quarter earning $100,000 for their charity.The score is set to 0-0 at the beginning of each quarter.Still with us? Because the rules change again for the final quarter.The game clock will be turned off for the fourth quarter and a Final Target Score will be set. For basketball fans in the US, this concept is known as an \"Elam Ending,\" which was conceived by college professor Nick Elam. The format is used in The Basketball Tournament, an annual $2 million event that airs on ESPN.This will be determined by taking the leading team's total cumulative score through three quarters and adding 24 points -- 24 representing Kobe Bryant's jersey number for the final 10 seasons of his NBA career.The first team to reach the Final Target Score will win the NBA All-Star Game and $200,000 for their charity.In theory, one team can earn $500,000 for their charity by winning all three quarters and the game overall and if this happens, the losing team will earn $100,000 for their charity.Bryant, pictured with his daughter Gianna, made his last of 18 All-Star games in his retirement year in 2016.As players look to preserve their bodies for the final stint of the regular season, the game has lost its competitiveness in recent times. However, things could be different this year. The chance to be a standout player in a game commemorating Bryant, a notoriously competitive combatant, will be too enticing for some to resist.Bryant himself was an 18-time All-Star, and won All-Star MVP four times.He missed out on selection only in his rookie season, in 1997, and 1999.The most exciting game of the weekend?While it is undetermined whether the All-Star Game will be a good game, could Friday's Rising Stars game be more exciting than the main event? Kicking off at 9 p.m. ET after the Celebrity Game, the game will be played between rookie and sophomore players on Team USA v. Team World.The World team is led by Dallas Mavericks 20-year old Slovenian All-Star Luka Don\u010di\u0107, while the US team is led by Atlanta Hawks All-Star Trae Young.Only in the second year in the NBA, both are already two of the biggest names in the league.Don\u010di\u0107 averages 28.9 points and nearly a triple-double per game.The 21-year old Young averages more points with 29.7, and is doing his utmost to drag his second-bottom placed Hawks to higher in the Eastern Conference standings.Young has nine games with more than 40 points, and 27 games with more than 30 points.The point guard will have the busiest weekend, also competing in the 3-Point Contest.READ: Is Zion Williamson vs. Ja Morant a new NBA rivalry?The pull of rookies Zion Williamson (center) and Ja Morant (second from the left) along with sophomores Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and Trae Young gives 2020's Rising Stars game the promise of being one of the great All-Star games.Additionally, Zion Williamson and Ja Morant's presence for Team USA will make the team tough to beat. The much-hyped Williamson comes into the game on the back of his first two 30-point games.Such is the impact he has made in the 10 games since his NBA debut in January, some believe he could beat Morant out for Rookie of the Year.Morant himself goes into the game with a similar hot streak, after recording his first career triple-double against the Washington Wizards.After that performance, Wizards coach Scott Brooks said Morant \"plays like a five-year All-Star\" already.JUST WATCHED'The first reality show': 'Hoop Dreams' at 25ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'The first reality show': 'Hoop Dreams' at 25 02:21Superman is in the buildingSaturday night sees the Skills Challenge, the 3-Point Contest and the always highly anticipated Slam Dunk contest, with proceedings beginning at 8 p.m. ET.The 2008 Slam Dunk contest champion Dwight Howard returns for the first time since the last of his three appearances finishing in 2009.The NBA veteran, famous for donning a Superman cape for his 2008 winning dunk, has the worst odds of winning going into the weekend.Four years ago today, Aaron Gordon and Zach LaVine gave us one of the greatest Slam Dunk Contests in NBA history.Unforgettable night.(via @NBA) pic.twitter.com/lS3SITguqz\u2014 Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) February 13, 2020 He faces off against 2017 runner-up Derrick Jones Jr., Dunk contest rookie Pat Connaughton and 2016 finalist Aaron Gordon, who came a narrow second in what many consider to be one of the best Slam Dunk contests of all time.Bryant won the Dunk contest at the age of just 18, becoming the youngest ever winner -- a record that stands to this day.Kobe Bryant won the Slam Dunk contest as an 18-ear old rookie in 1997 - the youngest ever to win.The dunks on show have become more visually impressive than Bryant's 1997 winner.But that marked his arrival in the NBA.A super confident rookie, performing in the clutch and establishing the start of a legacy.His memorial service takes place February 24 at Los Angeles' Staples Center, but this weekend will be the most prominent opportunity for the NBA and players past and present to pay their respects to a legend.",

Ilyina was tested for coronavirus a number of times since returning from China's Heinan Island, but the samples were negative, Cherkasov said.\"If she poses any danger for the people, as the chief sanitary physician states, no measures confirming there is a danger are being undertaken.\" Nearly 230 Russian citizens are currently waiting to return from China, according to Russia's Federal Air Transport Agency.Coronavirus prankster faces five years in jail in RussiaTwo coronavirus cases have been confirmed in Russia, according to the country's consumer watchdog, the Federal Service for Supervision of Consumer Rights Protection and Human Well-Being.

These are always labeled as such. \"The entry for YIDDO n. is labeled as offensive and derogatory and our reference to Tottenham Hotspur is a reflection of the evidence for the word. \"As we state at the closely related word YID n., Tottenham Hotspur Football Club is traditionally associated with the Jewish community in north and east London, and the term is sometimes used as a self-designation by some Tottenham fans. \"We will ensure the context for this connection is very clear in both definitions.\"Not controversial among many of the Jewish Spurs supporters, such as myself, who are proud to be Yiddos #COYS #THFC https://t.co/UgeUwlpTRm\u2014 Stephen Pollard (@stephenpollard) February 12, 2020 Jewish groups have appealed to the club in the past to take action over fans' use of the word, though other prominent members of the Jewish community, who are also Spurs fans, have differing views on the matter though. Stephen Pollard, who is editor of the Jewish Chronicle, tweeted: \"Not controversial among many of the Jewish Spurs supporters, such as myself, who are proud to be Yiddos.\"Writing in the Jewish Chronicle last year, Spurs fan Gerald Jacobs said: \"In the mouths of Spurs fans, it is all positive. Once the crowd greets a player with the cry of \"Yiddo,\" he knows he has made the grade and/or had hero status conferred upon him.\"Quite apart from the fact that Yiddish is the everyday language of many Charedim, and that in mainstream Jewish life its currency is mostly confined to senior circles, do we really want to ban, say, klezmer musicians from playing Yidl Mit'n Fidl, or when your bubbe [grandmother] talks about a \"nice Yiddishe\" boy or girl, are you going to tell her not to?\" added Jacobs.Last year, the club carried out a survey focused on use of the Y-word to which 23,000 fans responded, of which 11% were Jewish.Some 94% of respondents acknowledged the Y-word can be considered a racist term against a Jewish person and 33% of respondents said they use the word \"regularly\" in a footballing context, with 12% of respondents admitting to using the word outside of a footballing context.The survey also showed that 18% of respondents do not use the term in a footballing context, considering it \"offensive,\" with the number rising to 35% among Jewish respondents.Less than half of all respondents said they would prefer to see supporters choose to chant the Y-word less or stop using it altogether.",

        "content": "(CNN)A British man linked to a number of coronavirus cases after traveling from Singapore to a French ski chalet to the UK has fully recovered. The patient, Steve Walsh, is believed to have infected at least nine other people during his stay in the French Alps after contracting the virus in Singapore. He released a statement Tuesday revealing his name and thanking the UK's National Health Service for its help and care.Walsh had attended a conference at the Grand Hyatt hotel in Singapore in late January, hosted by the gas analysis company Servomex, which has since confirmed that \"a limited number of its employees in different countries have been diagnosed with the coronavirus and are now being treated.\" Walsh works at Servomex. UK patient Steve Walsh But the conference appears to have led to a chain of transmission for Walsh, who left Singapore on January 24 to fly to the French Alps, where he spent four days vacationing in a ski chalet in Contamines-Montjoie, southeast France. France on Saturday confirmed five new cases of the virus, all of them British nationals, including one 9-year-old child who had spent time in a school in the resort. The patients were infected after coming into contact with a UK citizen who had traveled from Singapore, according to local health official Jean-Yves Grall.The 1st US evacuee infected with coronavirus was mistakenly released due to CDC and hospital errors, health official saysRead MoreWalsh left the French ski resort on January 28, taking an EasyJet flight from nearby Geneva, Switzerland to London's Gatwick airport. Walsh said in his statement Tuesday that he contacted his doctor and health authorities as soon as he knew he had been exposed to a confirmed case of coronavirus. \"I was advised to attend an isolated room at hospital, despite showing no symptoms, and subsequently self-isolated at home as instructed. When the diagnosis was confirmed I was sent to an isolation unit in hospital, where I remain, and, as a precaution, my family was also asked to isolate themselves.\"Four further patients in England tested positive for coronavirus on Monday, bringing the country's total tally to eight, the UK Department of Health said in a statement. The new cases are all known contacts of a previously confirmed UK case, and the virus was passed on to them in France, it said. Coronavirus prankster faces five years in jail in RussiaThe agency also declared the virus a \"serious and imminent threat to public health,\" which gives officials authority to impose quarantine restrictions on people who \"could present a risk of infecting or contaminating others.\"  Some media have suggested that Walsh may be a \"super-spreader\" of the virus, meaning a single patient who transmits the infection to many other people, but experts urge caution.University of Edinburgh infectious disease expert Mark Woolhouse told CNN: \"I don't think it's helpful to highlight an individual.\" That's because it's not clear how many people he actually infected, whether he \"sheds\" the virus more readily than any other person, or whether he was simply in contact with more people and thus, more likely to pass the virus on. Woolhouse prefers the term \"super spreading event.\"World Health Organization (WHO) Executive Director Dr. Michael J Ryan called on the media not to personalize the disease, while answering a question about Walsh on Tuesday.Ryan dismissed reports that Walsh was a \"super spreader,\" saying the circumstances around his case were \"unfortunate\" but \"by no means a massive super spreading event.\"This is life under coronavirus quarantine on a cruise ship, military base, in a hotel or at homeAs fears over the transmission of coronavirus grow, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus  said on Monday: \"In recent days, we have seen some concerning instances of onward transmission from people with no travel history to China, like the cases reported in France yesterday and the United Kingdom today. The detection of this small number of cases could be the spark that becomes a bigger fire. But for now, it's only a spark. Our objective remains containment.\"EasyJet said it was notified by British health authorities about an infected passenger on board, but that as of Monday there had been no other confirmed cases from that flight, nor had any passengers shown symptoms.French authorities have \"managed to contact and trace all people who were in contact with the British tourists who were in the village,\" health minister Agnes Buzyn told French CNN affiliate BFM. The ski center plans to remain open, according to Etienne Jacquet, the mayor of Contamines-Montjoie.       The Grand Hyatt in Singapore, meanwhile, said no one who contracted the virus showed symptoms while at the luxury hotel, and none of its staff has tested positive. When it learned of cases originating on its property the hotel said it immediately started taking the temperature of its guests, and its staff twice a day. It has also brought in an outside government agency to sanitize and \"deep clean\" affected public areas and guestrooms.",

        "content": "Rome (CNN)The leader of Italy's popular populist party, Senator Matteo Salvini, has lost his legal immunity from a criminal investigation and potential trial over his 2019 treatment of a group of migrants.Salvini was accused of abusing his powers last July, when as interior minister he prevented 131 migrants from disembarking an Italian coastguard boat at the port of Catania, Sicily, as he waited for European Union states to agree to take them in.Italy's Senate voted on Wednesday to exceptionally lift the legal immunity Salvini is granted as a member of the chamber, giving magistrates in Catania a green-light to consider a case against him.If the legal process moves forward and he is found guilty, Salvini could face up to 15 years in jail and a ban on holding elected office. A conviction would scuttle his hopes to become Italy's next prime minister and return his euroskeptic League party back to power.Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte returns to patch together a new Salvini-free governmentBut the process could also present him with a platform to pitch himself as the embattled defender of the country's borders and bolster his base. The far-right leader welcomed the trial on Wednesday, calling for clarity on whether defending Italy against illegal immigration is a criminal act.Read More\"Let's let a judge decide, let's leave this hall, and let him decide. Now the emperor is without clothes, you can go forward for the next few months or weeks but in a democracy judgment is given by the people,\" Salvini said.\"I can no longer pass as a criminal, there is a limit to everything.\"Italy seizes migrant boat stranded off coast for 19 daysSalvini has long said that he was defending Italy's borders with support of the government when he blocked asylum seekers last year. That mantra has played well with supporters of the League, which Salvini has shaped into Italy's most popular party on a message of anti-immigration and law and order.The League is now in the opposition, after Salvini pulled the party out of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte's  government in August, in a failed attempt to force a snap election.But Salvini is waiting for the fragile coalition that replaced his to collapse, so he can make another bid to lead Italy.",

Yes, and my team's been aware of it and we've delved into the details of it and trying to figure it all out, just like everyone else,\" Woods told reporters ahead of the PGA Tour's Genesis Invitational at Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades, California.Read More\"There's a lot of information that we're still looking at and whether it's reality or not.\"READ: Tiger Woods: A tumultuous 10 years from scandal to redemptionREAD: Woods on fame: I don't like it.

Hide Caption 29 of 29'Ideas are going to happen'The PGA Tour is the premier professional circuit in the United States with about $341 million in prize money available across 46 official events, according to its website. The European Tour organizes events in Europe and around the world, outside the US, with about $230 million up for grabs. The four majors -- the Masters, the PGA Championship, the US Open and the Open -- are separate entities but are co-sanctioned, as are the four World Golf Championships events. Eligible players can compete on both tours as long as they fulfill a minimum requirement of events on their home circuit. PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan and European Tour chief Keith Pelley have refused to discuss \"hypothetical\" plans for a global circuit but have warned players they would have to choose between the old tour and any new iteration. But Woods pointed to the World Golf Championships, which began in 1999 as a way of getting the top players together more often outside of the four majors, and suggested closer alignment between the established tours is a likelihood in the future. \"I think that just like all events, you're trying to get the top players to play more collectively,\" added the former world No.1, who has won more than $120 million on the PGA Tour since turning pro in 1996.\"And so this is a natural evolution, whether or not things like this are going to happen. But ideas like this are going to happen going forward, whether it's now or any other time in the future.\"Woods, the 15-time major champion, is chasing a record-breaking 83rd  PGA Tour win in California this week.He made his PGA Tour debut as a 16-year-old amateur at Riviera in 1992 but has never won in 12 tournaments at the venue.",

        "content": "(CNN)The Church of England has decided to apologize for racism experienced by \"countless black, Asian and minority ethnic people\" over the past 70 years.The Church said in a statement that the General Synod, its legislative body, voted on Tuesday to issue an official apology and commission an outside expert to prepare a report on racism, race and ethnicity in the church.Invited to the UK decades ago, now they must prove they're BritishSpeaking at the synod, the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who is the church's most senior bishop, said there was \"no doubt\" that the Church of England was still \"deeply institutionally racist\".\"We did not do justice in the past, we do not do justice now, and unless we are radical and decisive in this area in the future, we will still be having this conversation in 20 years time and still doing injustice,\" he added. Welby was responding to a speech given by Reverend Andrew Moughtin-Mumby, a member of the synod from Southwark Diocese in London. Moughtin-Mumby introduced the motion that called for the apology, and told the synod about the harrowing experiences of the family of Doreen Browne, one of his parishioners.Read MoreHe said that in 1961, the family was barred from entering St Peter's Church in Walworth, south London, because of the color of their skin. Church of England apologizes for saying only married heterosexuals should have sex\"Doreen's family suffered a horrible, humiliating racism which still affects Doreen's relationship with the Church even today,\" he said. He added that while the Browne family eventually found a parish church they were welcomed in, many who arrived from the Caribbean didn't and ended up leaving the church as a result.\"That is a scandal of our own,\" he said.The Windrush generationThe statement from the church specifically mentions the so-called Windrush generation, the first large group of Caribbean migrants to arrive in the United Kingdom after World War II. They were invited by the UK government to come and help rebuild Britain after the devastation of the war. Hundreds of thousands of people came from former British colonies. Until a new immigration law came into force in 1973, Commonwealth citizens and their children had the automatic right to live and work in the UK. When successive British governments adopted a tougher approach to illegal immigration in recent years, descendants of these first immigrants found themselves under scrutiny. The government adopted new laws in 2012 that require employers, landlords and health service providers to demand evidence of legal immigration status. UK government apology to 18 Windrush victims criticized as 'drop in the ocean'Some descendants of the Windrush generation have struggled to prove their status, because they don't have these required documents. As a consequence, some lost their jobs, others were evicted from their homes, and a few were reported to have been threatened with deportation.The government was forced to apologize -- repeatedly -- for their treatment of the Windrush generation and their descendants. Now, the Church of England has followed. \"We have damaged the Church, we have damaged the image of God and most of all, we have damaged those we victimized, unconsciously very often,\" Welby said.",

        "content": "(CNN)Angela Merkel's grand transition plan has derailed after her handpicked successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, unexpectedly called it quits on Monday.Kramp-Karrenbauer, better known as AKK, announced she would not stand as the Christian Democratic Union's (CDU) candidate to be German chancellor in the next federal election. She is also stepping down as the party's chairwoman, according to the CDU's press office.Merkel, who has been chancellor for almost 15 years, said in 2018 that she would not run again when her term expires in 2021. At that time, she stepped down as party leader and endorsed Kramp-Karrenbauer as her successor. But her attempt at securing an orderly transition of power -- as well as her own legacy -- appears to have failed.How a former history teacher led a far-right surge in eastern GermanySome say the chaos is of Merkel's own making. \"To me, this failure is symptomatic of the way Angela Merkel has exercised power,\" said Henrik Enderlein, president of the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. \"She never allowed anyone to rise within the federal government and become a natural heir.\"Read MoreEnderlein pointed out that after Merkel stepped down as CDU leader in 2018, the top three candidates for the post were Friedrich Merz, who had spent years outside of politics, and two rather junior politicians -- 38-year old health minister Jens Spahn and Kramp-Karrenbauer.\"AKK was a still relatively inexperienced regional governor of a tiny German state,\" Enderlein said.Moving away from Merkel's politicsArmin Laschet, Friedrich Merz and Jens Spahn are seen as the leading contenders to replace Angela Merkel, following Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer's decision to step down as CDU chairwoman.Florian Hense, an analyst at Berenberg Bank, said that despite the chaos, it seemed extremely unlikely that Merkel would change her mind and run again in 2021.He said Merz and Armin Laschet, the prime minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, are likely to be the top contenders in the next leadership race.Merz lost narrowly to AKK in 2018, and Hense said he might be better suited to take on the far-right Alternative for Germany than the other leadership candidates. He would certainly be a popular choice for those who are looking for a bigger change when Merkel's reign comes to an end.Merkel formed a grand coalition with the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), and some parts of the CDU have criticized her for what they see as a move to the left. Merz, a corporate lawyer who has spent the past decade working for the investment company BlackRock, would move the party more to the right. Could Angela Merkel's successor be a Green?Spahn is also likely to throw his hat into the ring, although Hesse said his chances are likely to be limited, since he is not as popular among the wider German population. Whoever becomes the next leader of the CDU will face the challenge of reuniting a deeply divided party. That division was on display last week, when a regional branch of the CDU in the eastern German state of Thuringia breached a decades-old taboo and teamed up with the AfD to elect a liberal candidate as the state's prime minister.\"Thuringia is an example of how the right wing of the CDU wants to take decisions autonomously and implicitly cooperate with the far-right AfD,\" Enderlein said. AKK's failure to force the regional CDU in Thuringia to stick to the official party line was just the last in a long list of moves that made her leadership look weak. Angela Merkel: Europe should make its own chips and electric car batteriesSpeaking at a news conference on Monday, she said the decision to resign had been growing in her mind for some time. She called on the party to become \"stronger than today.\"AKK's shock announcement has thrown the CDU -- and the whole of Germany -- into political uncertainty. One likely consequence of that will be a greater focus on domestic issues among German political leaders, something which could spell bad news for the European Union, which is desperately looking for strong leadership as it recovers from the United Kingdom's exit from the bloc. Enderlein said the episode shows that Merkel is still the cornerstone of German politics. The four-time chancellor is on her way out -- and she certainly doesn't want her legacy to be associated with chaos. But Enderlein warned that might be exactly what's on the cards. \"Her departure ... will leave a big void [and] is likely to fundamentally deeply destabilize the German political system,\" he said.",

        "content": "London (CNN)An English farmer writing more than 200 years ago had more modern and liberal views on homosexuality than many governments do today, an entry in a newly discovered diary shows. Matthew Tomlinson, a farmer from West Yorkshire in Northern England, wrote in January 1810 that homosexuality was innate and that punishing it by death was cruel.A page of Tomlinson's diary. Credit: The University of OxfordResponding to reports in the media about a naval surgeon being executed for sodomy -- a typical punishment for homosexuality in the 19th century -- Tomlinson reasoned that penalizing people for something that had been their \"nature from childhood\" was unfair.Where being gay is illegal around worldThe find has upended historians' assumptions about historical attitudes to homosexuality, contradicting the view that it was unanimously seen as abnormal and dangerous at the time -- and could be considered a more modern attitude than those held by the 70 countries around the world that still criminalize homosexuality.Tomlinson wrote: \"It appears a paradox to me, how men, who are men, shou'd possess such a passion; and more particularly so, if it is their nature from childhood (as I am informed it is) -- If they feel such an inclination, and propensity, at that certain time of life when youth genders [i.e. develops] into manhood; it must then be considered as natural, otherwise, as a defect in nature ... it seems cruel to punish that defect with death.\"Read MoreHe goes on to grapple with the question of why God would create people who are attracted to the same sex and then dictate that they should be penalized, writing: \"It must seem strange indeed that God Almighty shou'd make a being, with such a nature; or such a defect in nature; and at the same time make a decree that if that being whome he had formed, shou'd at any time follow the dictates of that Nature with which he was formed he shou'd be punished with death.\" Same sex marriage is finally legal in Northern IrelandEuropean societies at the time were significantly more religious than today.The death penalty was used on those found guilty of sodomy in England and Wales until around the middle of the 19th century, before it was replaced with a prison sentence in 1861.In 1885, all homosexual acts were made illegal, until homosexuality was eventually decriminalized in 1967.As many as 12 countries still penalize homosexuality with capital punishment, and it is criminalized by 70 nations, according to the LGBT monitoring group ILGA.  An 'extraordinary' discoveryThe surprising passage in Tomlinson's diary was discovered accidentally by Eamonn O'Keeffe, a researcher at the University of Oxford, who had been looking into the role of British military musicians during the Napoleonic Wars.\"This exciting discovery complicates and enriches our understanding of Georgian attitudes towards sexuality, suggesting that the revolutionary conception of same-sex attraction as a natural human tendency, discernible from adolescence, was mooted within the social circles of an ordinary Yorkshire farmer,\" O'Keeffe said in a press release.\"While Tomlinson's writings reflect the opinions of only one man, his phrasing - 'as I am informed it is' - implies that his comments were informed by the views of others,\" he added.Church of England apologizes for saying only married heterosexuals should have sexOther figures from the era, including the philosopher Jeremy Bentham, also mooted relaxing the punishment of homosexuality -- but little evidence had previously suggested that such views were commonplace.Several historians have lauded the finding. Princeton University professor Fara Dabhoiwala said in the press release that it \"provides vivid proof that, even during times of severe persecution, historical attitudes to same-sex behaviour could be more sympathetic than is usually presumed.\"\"It is extraordinary to find an ordinary, casual observer in 1810 seriously considering the possibility that sexuality is innate and making arguments for decriminalisation,\" added Rictor Norton, an American expert on gay history.",

Zero defensive reliability and sparks up front with Messi as a fire extinguisher. Crazy.\"Messi as a firefighter is an apt analogy for Barcelona this season, or perhaps the past five seasons, putting out the flames caused by a haphazard recruitment and underperforming teammates.Frenkie De Jong celebrates his goal with Lionel Messi.But there are only so many shortcomings that even Messi, regarded by many as the greatest of all time, can make up for.\"Stopping the breakdowns in defense, Setien's first great challenge,\" wrote Barcelona-based newspaper Sport. \"The team makes lots of errors and concedes too much space to its opponents.\"Beyond (Nabil) Fekir's great match, the feeling of impotence to stop him was obvious and worrying.\"READ: What next for Lionel Messi after the Instagram post that rocked Barcelona?READ: Barcelona in crisis after Lionel Messi lashes out at club's hierarchy'Lack of aim'Setien received a warm welcome on his return to Betis, the club he left in 2019 following an up and down two year-spell with the club.Much of the brilliance and frustration that has come to define him as a coach and his time in charge at Betis was on display for Barcelona, which makes his assessment of the match unsurprising.\"I really liked the team,\" he told reporters after the game. \"You have to put things into perspective, there are things we could have done better but I'm happy. We twice overturned an adverse scoreline.Sergio Busquets holds Messi aloft after equalizing for Barcelona.\"The team is improving in many things and I am very happy with the performance, the result and everything else.\"Marca was less enthusiastic about both Barcelona and Messi, choosing to focus on his mini goal drought which has extended to 27 shots and three matches.\"Messi covers up his striking bad run in front of goal with assists,\" it wrote, though it does seem like a slight overreaction for a player who leads both the goal and assist ranking in La Liga this season.Another article read: \"The Argentine replaces his lack of aim with the precision of his assists.\"It was the fourth time Messi has recorded a hat-trick of assists for Barcelona -- only Mesut Ozil has more in his career with seven.Barcelona was particularly grateful for Messi's creativity, as it ensured the club remained on Real Madrid's coattails at the top of La Liga.Earlier on Sunday, Real had to come from behind to beat Osasuna 4-1 and temporarily extend its lead to six points, before Barcelona halved the advantage later that evening.Barcelona's task of keeping pace with Real becomes no easier, as it welcomes high-flying Getafe to the Camp Nou on Saturday.READ: El Clasico fallout -- Real Madrid takes aim at referee, VARReal host Barcelona in El Clasico on March 1.",

Ante Rebic couldn't miss after the Swede's knockdown set up the opener and Ibrahimovic added a second himself with a towering header. However, the match was turned on its head in the second half after Inter scored two goals in as many minutes.Marcelo Brozovic kickstarted the comeback with a wonderfully hit volley before Matias Vecino's strike wriggled its way into the net. Stefan de Vrij then put Inter ahead with a glancing header in the 70th minute. \"The goals were incredible feelings and memories that will last forever. Winning is a unique feeling.

        "content": "(CNN)Ireland began its official vote count Sunday as the nation waits for a clearer picture of its future government, following an exit poll that suggested the general election ended in a three-way dead heat.The exit poll, released as voting ended at 10 p.m. (5 p.m. ET) on Saturday, showed Taoiseach, or Prime Minister, Leo Varadkar's Fine Gael party with 22.4% of first preference votes. Sinn F\u00e9in won 22.3% while Fianna F\u00e1il gained 22.2%.Sinn F\u00e9in's leader Mary Lou McDonald has helped transform the party to attract younger voters.With a margin of error of 1.3%, the poll meant the election was too close to call Saturday, but indicated a hung parliament was almost inevitable and that long political negotiations were ahead. The once-marginal Sinn F\u00e9in -- which was the political wing of the IRA during its drive to force Britain out of Northern Ireland -- appears to have successfully reshaped its image. According to the exit poll by Ipsos MRBI for The Irish Times, RT\u00c9 and others, the party has become a popular option for young Irish voters frustrated with issues such as housing unaffordability.Sinn F\u00e9in -- led by Mary Lou McDonald, who took over from longtime leader Gerry Adams two years ago -- was never in the running to command the Irish D\u00e1il, or parliament, outright and form a government. It only fielded 42 candidates, short of the 80-seat threshold. There are 160 seats in the D\u00e1il. The speaker is automatically re-elected and not considered a lawmaker with voting rights.Read MoreSinn F\u00e9in could technically form a coalition with smaller parties, but its success Saturday is more likely to translate into a seat at the table in coalition negotiations.Fine Gael has said it would not accept Sinn F\u00e9in in any coalition. Fianna F\u00e1il, led by Miche\u00e1l Martin, has said the same, although some analysts have speculated it is not impossible for both nationalist parties to work together.Varadkar's Fine Gael party currently leads a minority government propped up in a confidence-and-supply arrangement with Fianna F\u00e1il. A possible scenario is that Fianna F\u00e1il could win the most seats and Fine Gael returns the favor by supporting its rivals.Should political negotiations fail and no party can form a government, fresh elections are another possibility.The vote count should by the end of the day show larger margins between the number of seats allocated to each party than the exit poll's three-way tie in the popular vote suggests. It's not inconceivable that counting in some constituencies could continue into the days ahead. Ireland uses a system of proportional representation but also includes preferential voting, meaning that first-choice votes could be shifted to other candidates and translate to a different proportion of seats. A woman casts her ballot in Dublin on Saturday.Varadkar was elected leader of Fine Gael in 2017, in a historic vote that propelled the former doctor to become the country's first openly gay Taoiseach, as well as its youngest and the first with an ethnic minority background. He was seen as a symbol of a fast-liberalizing Ireland, overseeing the country's relaxation of its strict anti-abortion laws just years after Ireland legalized same-sex marriage. Varadkar had highlighted the rebound in the Irish economy and his role in Brexit negotiations to keep open the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, in his campaign for re-election. Fine Gael has, however, been in power since 2011 and pre-election polls showed a clear appetite for change.",

        "content": "London (CNN)The UK may have only left the European Union last Friday, but its next opportunity to stagger blindly off a cliff is just 20 weeks away. The current Brexit transition period is due to expire on December 31. Between now and then, both the UK and Brussels hope to reach an agreement on their future relationship. Failure to do so would mean no formal agreement and the immediate cessation of all current arrangements, causing untold chaos and disruption. And while the transition period can be extended, the UK needs to decide whether it wishes to do so before July 1. That, according to international law, really is the point of no return and potentially the new economic cliff edge. Boris Johnson has said that he has absolutely no intention of extending.Given that it took nearly four years to reach an agreement with Brussels that avoided the first cliff edge, you'd think this might be cause for alarm in London. Pro-Brexit supporters wave placards at Parliament Square as people prepare for Brexit on January 31.However, since Brexit Day, Westminster has been eerily quiet on the single most important issue facing the United Kingdom in 2020. Read MoreJohnson's Conservatives are swaggering around with the confidence you might expect of a government that recently won a landslide victory in the most important general election of a generation. Gone are the days of deadlock; Johnson's government is now free to pursue whatever agenda it likes in this post-EU reality. Locking hornsRight now, what it seems to like doing most is picking fights. In the past week alone, Downing Street tried to play divide and rule with the British press, excluding some reporters from news outlets deemed to be critical of its policies from government briefings -- including those given by impartial civil servants. It also announced plans that pave the way to removing the BBC's public funding model. Johnson's government has been locking horns with the BBC virtually since he came to power over the summer, and many in his inner team believe that the national broadcaster has an anti-Brexit, anti-Johnson bias. Boris Johnson's government is locking horns with the publicly funded BBC.And he's setting himself up to have a nasty screaming match with human rights lawyers later this month. Johnson's government is putting forward controversial legislation that would change how and when people convicted of terror offenses are released from prison. It's possible that these plans are illegal under human rights law. The question is, why is a PM with such a huge task ahead of him so willfully poking so many hornets' nests? \"This government obviously likes conflict. I don't think they are particularly bothered by people seeing them as being at war with the BBC or in conflict with judges over keeping suspected terrorists in prison via retrospective legislation. And if it serves as a distraction from the government's Brexit strategy, so much the better,\" says Anand Menon, director of the UK in a changing EU think tank.Whether it's a deliberate distraction strategy or not, Boris Johnson's government is becoming defined by its propensity for combat. Civil servants who had served previous administrations complain that Johnson's political advisers are \"arrogant,\" \"overly confident\" and deliberately creating an \"us versus them culture.\" JUST WATCHEDAs it happened: The day the UK left the EUReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAs it happened: The day the UK left the EU 01:49However, many of these civil servants are not seeing much beyond the bluster. Despite having the mandate to pursue whatever agenda it likes, Johnson's government seems fixated on telling people how much they want to change the country without doing all that much about it. Which somewhat lends weight to the theory that Johnson's government is eager that the national conversation be on any subject other than Brexit. And that could be down to the fact that the UK's current Brexit strategy appears to be sitting tight, not saying very much and letting the clock run down. And many are worried that this is because the government's real strategy is to leave at the end of this year with no formal future relationship in place. \"The government is existing day-to-day at the moment ... I think with all things added up, it's becoming very likely we are going to leave on December 31 without a deal,\" says Chris Bryant, an opposition Labour Party lawmaker.  Earlier in the week Johnson talked about the UK's future relationship with Europe being like Australia's. Phil Hogan, the EU's trade commissioner, quickly pointed out that Australia has no formal trading relationship with the EU, and that he believed it was code for \"no deal.\" When asked for its response to Hogan's comments, the government told CNN that Australia has several bilateral agreements with the EU, and that it already has a deal with the EU -- the deal that it left last Friday. Despite the noisy protests on Brexit Day on January 31, there is little effective opposition to the government in Westminster at the moment.Gloom in WestminsterThere is also little scrutiny of the government's Brexit policy at the moment. When general elections are called, Parliament is dissolved. This means that parliamentary committees that exist to scrutinize the government are gone and not reelected until Parliament is up and running again. That process can take months and it largely at the mercy of the government. \"The problem with an election is it takes Parliament out of action for about four months in terms of total scrutiny,\" explains Bryant. The opposition Labour Party is not doing a great job of holding Johnson to account. This isn't a huge surprise, seeing as it's currently electing a new leader. However, the result of this contest will not come until April 4, by which time official talks with the EU will have started and that July 1 deadline will be just 89 days away.The Labour Party was instrumental in forcing Johnson to extend the previous Brexit deadline. It also frustrated Johnson by not allowing him to hold an election until no deal had been taken officially off the table. However, on Wednesday at the weekly session of Prime Minister's Questions, Labour's leader, Jeremy Corbyn, didn't raise Johnson's recent shift to an Australia deal or the fact that the EU's top trade official claims it is cover for no deal. Lawmakers in Johnson's own Conservative party who are not in the inner circle are equally despondent at their inability to affect the government's position on Brexit. They say with a resigned shrug that Johnson doesn't need them any more. Whoever you talk to, the biggest concern is that Johnson is going to spend the next year playing to his Euroskeptic base. They fear he will talk up the hardest deal possible. It might be economic folly, but so what? JUST WATCHEDHere's what you need to know about BrexitReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHere's what you need to know about Brexit 03:38Despite the gloominess in some corners of Westminster, the mood in Brussels is calm. \"We've been doing this for three years now. We are not surprised by political developments in Westminster. All that matters is what happens when we get in the room,\" one EU official told CNN. EU diplomats share this view. They accept that Johnson's government wants a harder Brexit than they are happy about, but ultimately are aware that it's the UK who faces the more daunting cliff edge at the end of this year. And many in Brussels are quick to note that cliff edges have previously worked to bring the Brits closer to Brussels when the crunch comes. The only real unknown in all of this is what Johnson ultimately wants. He has frequently stated he wants a free trade deal that causes minimum disruption while being able to diverge from the EU on rules. He is happy to tell the EU that the UK will maintain high standards on things like foods, but he is less keen to commit to anything in writing. This could become a sticking point as the clock runs down.Despite the relatively short period of time for all this to get done, it's worth noting that the UK starts from a position of full alignment with the EU and that Brussels isn't hellbent on punishing the UK for leaving. There is goodwill on both sides -- at the moment -- and there is very clearly a deal waiting to be done. The problem, as with all things Brexit, is politics. Johnson is thought by many to have buckled in Brussels to get Brexit done. He just about sold it to his own party, with some enormous caveats. If he tries to do it again, he might not find his Conservative party so supportive. However, if he does play hard and do a deal that harms the British economy, he could equally find that the voters who handed him a majority are turned off. Boris Johnson upended British politics in December. He won the most important election in recent history, delivered Brexit and is currently walking on air. However, he has to make some enormous choices in the coming weeks and, far from getting it done, he is going to discover that Brexit will continue to dominate his career and define his political legacy. He'd do well to remember that when deciding what's best for the country. After all, despite the noise, it's only what he thinks and says that really matters now.",

Kicked clearances held up in the wind while players struggled to maintain their grip on the ball. The boot of Farrell opened the scoring, while also misfiring during a frantic but error-strewn first-half, which ended 3-0. Sean Maitland of Scotland and Elliot Daly of England contest a high ball.It was more of the same after the break, until Genge barreled over with just 10 minutes remaining to give Jones' men some breathing room. \"We are buzzing to win but there is more to come,\" Genge said. \"We had a bump in the road last week and people were saying we were not good enough. \"It's classic, you have a lot of sausages that say things that come to their head.

        "content": "(CNN)Another day, another new crisis at Barcelona.The Catalan club was stunned by Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey quarterfinals on Thursday, being eliminated by I\u00f1aki Williams' stoppage time winner at the San Mam\u00e9s.The defeat follows Lionel Messi's public war of words with sporting director and former teammate Eric Abidal, which forced club president Josep Bartomeu to request an emergency meeting with the pair on Wednesday evening.Barcelona in crisis after Lionel Messi lashes out at club's hierarchy Messi was incensed by Abidal's accusation that players had downed tools to get former manager Ernesto Valverde sacked. His response? To name the players or be quiet.According the reports in Spain, the Argentine has a clause in his contract -- which runs out in 2021 -- that allows him to leave Barcelona for free this summer, as long as he informs the club by May. Read MoreSo rarely does the 32-year-old air his grievances in public; it felt as though Abidal's comments were the straw that broke the camel's back.Barcelona's full-back Jordi Alba came out in defense of his captain following the shock defeat to Bilbao.\"Abidal was a player, he's not an outsider, he has to know how a player feels in the locker room,\" the Spaniard told newspaper Sport. \"Those of us who are facing the music are the players and coaching staff.\"We already get enough st thrown at us from the outside, so we shouldn't be throwing st at ourselves. We should all be helping each other.\"For years, Messi, regarded by many as the greatest of all time, has been the glue that has held a crumbling Barcelona together -- both on the pitch and in the boardroom.READ: 'This is all a dream' -- Teenage star gives Barcelona narrow victoryLionel Messi and Eric Abidal were teammates at Barcelona.His consistent, match-winning moments of genius have papered over cracks that have been steadily deepening for several seasons.On the pitch, around a billion dollars has been spent since Neymar's shock departure to Paris Saint-Germain in 2017 and several big-money, high-profile signings have failed to make a mark. Antoine Griezmann is the latest in a growing list that includes the likes of Philippe Coutinho, Ousmane Dembele and Malcom to have underperformed after joining with much fanfare.The president and the board have also been widely criticized for years. A scattergun approach to planning and recruitment has seen them fail to progress following the retirement of the club's previous generation of stars, notably the 2011 all-conquering homegrown vintage of Xavi and Iniesta.Indeed, it has now been five years since Barcelona won the Champions League, an almost unthinkable barren stretch for a team boasting one of the greatest players the game has ever seen.READ: Barcelona signs 20-year-old and then gives him $550 million price tagREAD: Why did Barcelona sack Ernesto Valverde?The last time Barcelona won the Champions League was way back in 2015.Messi 'exploded'However, after Wednesday's meeting, it seems both Abidal and Messi will remain at the club -- for now at least.Spanish newspaper Sport, the publication to which Abidal made the initial inflammatory quotes, say that \"Abidal's dismissal was never on the table\" and following a two-hour meeting, Bartomeu had \"settled the crisis\" at the club.Who is new Barcelona boss Quique Setien? The chess fanatic 'in love' with Lionel MessiAfter speaking with Messi over the phone, Bartomeu believes the situation is \"absolutely reconcilable,\" Sport say.Marca is less optimistic about the outcome, saying Messi \"exploded\" on Tuesday following Abidal's \"fatal\" comments and that he is being \"burdened with reasons to slam the door\" on Barcelona.Any talk about Messi's hypothetical exit from Barcelona usually involves him moving to Manchester City, the club which infamously tried to sign him in 2008 following the arrival of its new super rich owners.The reasoning is down to City being the only club that could realistically afford his wages -- reported by Football Leaks to be as much as $155 million over five years, bonuses included -- but City's acquisition of Pep Guardiola as manager adds another layer of intrigue.It's no secret there is mutual admiration between the two, with Guardiola helping mold Messi into the player he's become today during his early years in the Barcelona first team.Guardiola, likewise, has regularly admitted how lucky he was to coach a team containing Messi and says not having him at any of his subsequent clubs is the reason he has failed to win a Champions League title outside of Barcelona.Lionel Messi and Pep Guardiola share a mutual admiration.For now, though, new coach Quique Setien will have to face the rest of the season with a weaker squad than when he joined.The departures of several young fringe stars in January was supposed to free up space for a new attacking player, but that signing never materialized.And the news that forward Dembele will now be out for the rest of the season -- joining Luis Suarez on the long-term absentee list -- leaves Barcelona's squad stretched thin.Once again, the weight of expectation will be all Messi's to shoulder.",

        "content": "(CNN)Keane Mulready-Woods should have been celebrating his 18th birthday this week. But the Irish teenager's life came to an end last month, in a murder so brutal in nature that it has drawn comparisons with TV show \"Narcos.\"Ireland's ancient town of Drogheda -- pronounced Draw-head-a -- has become the setting for feuds between drug-dealing gangs that have claimed three lives in grisly tit-for-tat attacks.A day after Mulready-Woods went missing on a cold Sunday evening, parts of the boy's dismembered body were found in a Puma gym bag in north Dublin, 50 kilometers away, police say. Other body parts were found in a burning car in the capital. Irish media reports say Mulready-Woods' limbs were in the bag, and his severed head, hands and feet in the burning car. His torso is believed to still be missing.      The murder paints a dark picture of Ireland's changing underworld, which is increasingly recruiting boys and young men to carry out acts of violence, often to enforce debt payments as the country's addiction to drugs like cocaine grows. Years of austerity have left Drogheda without adequate social services and opportunities to keep young people off the streets, residents there say. Irish politicians have descended on Drogheda in the weeks leading up to Saturday's general election, amid growing concerns over crime and gang violence.Drogheda, a town north of Dublin, is at the center of a gruesome gang feud.Read MoreThe Drogheda drug feuds escalated in July 2018 with the shooting of a man linked to crime in the area, according to the Irish Times. He survived the hit but was left paralyzed. Tit-for-tat reprisals have been going on there ever since.The violence has been largely contained to a small number of social or council housing estates in the town's north, but thousands joined a march in the town center recently, in a show of unity against the gangs.At the rally was Louise Mahony, manager of the Red Door Project, which offers services to people with drug and alcohol problems. \"Today, we march to say enough is enough,\" she said to a crowd at the rally, according to video posted on Twitter. \"Enough under-resourcing, enough short-term quick fixes, enough of Drogheda being treated as a second-class town.\" Protesters march against violence in Drogheda on January 25.Gwen Fearon, a concerned Drogheda resident and the director at Stockwell Artisan Foods, also said austerity had left the town with a weakened police presence and not enough for young people to do. \"If more money was put into youth clubs and youth training, it would keep the youth occupied and give them another interest. Instead they're out, being groomed by gangs,\" she told CNN. \"Everything was cut when we went into recession. There's no funding, no money for drug outreach. This is just what happens when you cut police, resources and counseling for youth.\"Current Taoiseach, or prime minister, Leo Varadkar joined the rally and earlier visited Drogheda after Mulready-Woods' murder, vowing to \"make this town safe again\" and to have those responsible jailed.Fergus O'Dowd, who represents the community in the national parliament and belongs to Varadkar's ruling Fine Gael party, admitted a shortfall in state services to address drug addiction and youth crime, saying in a statement that private service providers were \"filling the gaps.\" When asked by CNN to elaborate, he said Varadkar had \"given me a commitment that Drogheda will have a drugs community tasks force\" to address the problem. A \"huge\" investment had been made in education and significant investments in deprived communities, he added. Drug trade being 'Uberized'A report on drug markets in Europe shows a growing trend in Ireland in the recruitment of boys and young men to carry out violence, as a means of intimidation to collect drug debts from users.It also points to \"hotlines\" and social media accounts being established in towns and rural areas through which people can order drugs, in what a European drug agency calls the \"uberization\" of the trade.A three-tier hierarchy has evolved among Ireland's gangs, with \"a lower tier of highly disadvantaged young people generally involved in bullying, assaulting, stealing, vandalizing and spreading fear on behalf of the network,\" the report says. A second tier involves young people engaged in \"high-risk, low-reward activities, such as transporting, holding or dealing drugs, carrying guns, and conducting shootings, beatings and serious intimidation\" on behalf of the top tier of \"serious players.\"Political leaders take part in the rally in Drogheda on January 25.In many cases, boys or young men who themselves are in debt to the gangs are recruited to begin repaying what they owe.With the growing number of young people in Ireland's gangs, comes a change in the way rivals communicate. Young members are using Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat to taunt, embarrass and provoke their rivals, Irish Star journalist Michael O'Toole, who has closely covered the Drogheda gang feuds, told CNN. The problem is, a lot of the information being spread is fake. Police had to call on people to stop sharing a video purporting to show the murder of Mulready-Woods (police later determined the video was not footage of his death).Police suspected, according to RTE, but did not confirm that the 17-year-old had filmed an attack on a rival gang member coming out of a gym in Dublin. The Irish Times reported that the Dublin attack involved stealing the member's gym bag and a pair of black-and-white flip-flops, adding that several young gang members posted images of themselves on social media, wearing the flip-flops and mocking their rival.When Mulready-Woods was dismembered, his limbs were also placed in a gym bag, along with a pair of black-and-white flip-flops, the same Irish Times report says, in a clear chilling message that the motive of the murder was revenge. The problem is, no one really knows if he filmed or had anything to do with the initial attack. \"This is really the first feud we've seen in the information age,\" O'Toole said. \"After Mulready-Woods was murdered, people were named online as being involved, but they weren't.\"Cocaine and the Celtic TigerViolence between drug-dealing gangs appears to escalate not in times of poverty but in times of economic boom.A study on cross-border crime between Ireland and Northern Ireland in 2018 found that cocaine use had returned to \"Celtic Tiger\" levels, referring to the economic boom period between 1995 and 2007.O'Dowd, the lawmaker, pointed out that employment, not unemployment, was playing a greater role in the violence.\"The problem has been exacerbated by our increase in employment, (which) meant there's more disposable income for people to buy and use recreational drugs. That's the other problem. It's not driven by poverty, it's driven by income,\" he told CNN.The difference between 2007 and now is that the drug can be found well beyond big-city borders in the smallest of villages, the report said. Despite these observations, a look at the Moneymore social housing estate, at the heart of Drogheda's gang feuds, suggests poverty still plays a major role in the violence.Homes there have been petrol-bombed, burned out and raided by police. Rivals send threatening messages to gang members through graffiti on the estate's walls.A committee at the Louth County Council formed to address the violence in Drogheda said it was making upgrades to the estate to improve safety and the quality of life for its residents.  \"The reputation of Drogheda has also suffered and we need to work together to support and implement actions to repair this damage,\" the committee's chair, Joan Martin, said in a statement sent to CNN. She said CCTV cameras would be reinstated in the Moneymore area, and that the council was carrying out drug outreach programs targeting young people living there.Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, right, with MP Fergus O'Dowd leaving the Drogheda police station on January 17.But there just isn't enough funding to support the organizations addressing drug addiction in the community, says Brenda Kirwan, who facilitates a support group in Drogheda for the Family Addiction Support Network.The network support families of drug and alcohol addicts, and in Drogheda, it says it gets a measly 7,500 euros a year from the government to run weekly meetings, respites for family members, a 24-hour helpline and intimidation reporting service. The rest of the money comes from donations and fundraising. All staff members are volunteers. \"The funding in this area needs to really go up a notch, a huge notch,\" Kirwan told CNN. She said a lot of families had been forced to send their children to other parts of the country, the UK and even as far as Australia to uproot them from the gangs they had fallen in with. \"These people might have been enduring an awful lot of what's going on in the town at the moment -- people knocking at the door looking for money because a loved one owes money, they could have their house smashed up, they could have had car smashed up, constantly being intimidated on the street,\" she said.\"Youth services have been cut -- there are now a few more things for younger children, but once they're in their late teens, there's very little there. Even education in school needs to be prioritized more. Young people are dropping out of school because of drugs, so we need to do more to keep them in education, and to get educated about drugs, because it's so easy to get into, but it's so hard to get out of. We have to show our children that there's more to life than this.\"Journalist Niamh Kennedy contributed to this report.",

Will Lionel Messi leave?The end product is there now, too, with Odegaard contributing six goals and five assists already this season to help Sociedad climb to eighth in La Liga and now reach the semifinals of the Copa del Rey.It's fair to say that Odegaard is showing more than a few signs of the promise that convinced Real Madrid to part with $9.5 million for him in 2015.READ: The rise and rise of Martin Odegaard'Kings of the Cup'Odegaard wasn't the only Scandinavian youngster showcasing his precocious talents at the Bernabeu on Thursday.Swede Alexander Isak, just 20 years old, scored two goals and assisted another to ensure the Copa del Rey is the one trophy Zinedine Zidane still hasn't won in his two spells as Real manager.In many ways, Isak's career trajectory has mirrored Odegaard's; signed from his hometown club at a young age and for a lot of money by a European giant -- in his case Borussia Dortmund -- before failing to impress and ending up at Sociedad.Similarly, Isak has found a comfortable home since signing for the Basque club permanently this season and has fired 14 goals already, including seven in his last five matches.Alexander Isak celebrates after scoring for Real Sociedad.\"Superhero Isak,\" was one headline in Madrid-based newspaper Marca. \"With his two goals and one assists, the Swede was the main architect of the path to the semifinals.\"Another headline read: \"Odegaard and Isak proclaim themselves kings of the Cup and and strike down Zidane's Madrid.\"Odegaard was up to his old tricks and served balls to Isak, who transformed into Ibrahimovic for one his goals.\"For the first time in a decade, the Copa del Rey final will feature neither Barcelona or Real Madrid.Not since Sevilla beat Atletico Madrid to lift the trophy in 2010 has either of Spain's two biggest clubs failed to get past the semifinal stage.This season, on a Thursday evening of shock results, both Barca and Real failed to make it past even the quarterfinals.As Real stumbled to defeat at a partially-empty Bernabeu, Barcelona was stunned in the 93rd minute by Athletic Bilbao at a raucous San Mames stadium.",

Even so, it's the moment Wibmer reached a thousand views that is still etched in his mind: \"It was like already super crazy and just like insane at that time.\"Wibmer's face lights up with excitement as he describes the thrill of navigating flights of stairs at speed -- the Austrian's \"Urban Freeride Lives 3\" video sees him travel from Lyon to Paris and conquer the cities' steps.  \"We couldn't really believe how many stairs there were. And it was pretty much the perfect playground for the video,\" said Wibmer, referring to Lyon, which is his favorite city for biking. Viewed over 13 million times, the video begins with one of Wibmer's hardest stunts. He flies down the city's famous stairs -- \"The Lyon 25,\" a 25-step stairway known for its frightening size. When he arrives in Paris he turns the Eiffel Tower into his biking playground.Wibmer's first 2020 video -- \"Israel Is My Playground,\" which has already clocked up millions of views -- follows him on his bike through Jerusalem's most iconic souks, castles and boulevards to the desert.  No space is safe when Wibmer is in town ....READ: Acrobatic daredevils perform on world's largest trampoline'Way too many ideas'But with popularity comes heightened expectation -- as well as pressure -- so Wibmer is conscious of trying to make each video better than the last.\"It's kind of like a challenge to try to avoid those thoughts somewhere in your head and to, you know, overcome them,\" says Wibmer, recalling the moments of doubt he has had to confront.Wibmer is constantly coming up with new stunt ideas.One of his videos -- \"Some of My Hardest Crashes\" -- focuses on the injuries Wibmer has suffered, including broken bones and deep wounds after he's crashed into streetlamps or fallen off construction sites.\"'To The Limit' is a good example to show people on how we think, our experience as athletes, that we are not dumb and like completely fearless,\" said Wibmer of about his new documentary, which delves into the ups and downs of what it's like to be an extreme sports athlete.Despite the risks he faces when he's riding his bike, Wibmer isn't planning on retiring anytime soon.\"I don't know when it's going to end or what's going to be in my last video, but I've got way too many ideas right now.\"",

The Air Zoom Alphafly NEXT%, a version of the prototype Eliud Kipchoge wore when he ran a marathon in 1:59:40 in Vienna last October, will be released in summer 2020, according to Nike.With a thick foam sole and added cushioning under the forefoot, the shoe looks like it has been pulled out of a sci-fi film. Running purists say the technology could harm the integrity of athletics, while Nike calls it a sign of \"game-changing progress.\"Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featuresLong distance times have tumbled since Nike's Vaporfly range was introduced in 2016, including Brigid Kosgei's 2:14:04 marathon in Chicago last year, knocking over a minute off Paula Radcliffe's previous record that had stood for 16 years. Read MoreThe Air Zoom Alphafly NEXT% will be available commercially available later this year. In a review of a range of leading running shoes, World Athletics recently approved Nike's Vaporfly range, but banned any shoes with soles thicker than 40mm or with more than one plate to enhance their spring.Eliud Kipchoge's record-breaking Nike shoes to be bannedFrom April 30, it will also ban from competition any shoes that have not been on public sale for four months.The new rules mean the prototype Eliud Kipchoge wore in Vienna are now non-compliant, but the latest Alphafly shoes -- which are believed to have a sole that is 39.5mm thick -- are passable.\"For runners, records like the four-minute mile and two-hour marathon are barometers of progress,\" said Tony Bignell, VP of Footwear Innovation at Nike. \"These are barriers that have tested human potential. When someone like Eliud breaks them, our collective belief about what's possible changes.\"Eliud Kipchoge wore a protype of the Alphafly shoe when he ran a sub-two-hour marathon. According to a 2017 study in the journal Sports Medicine, Nike's Vaporfly shoes provide a 4% boost in running economy -- the amount of work a runner must do at a given speed -- compared with other top racing models. Nike says the carbon fiber plate offers a sensation of propulsion, while the cushioning minimizes energy loss. JUST WATCHEDMeet the man who ran a marathon in all 196 countries in the worldReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMeet the man who ran a marathon in all 196 countries in the world 03:59Leading sports scientist Ross Tucker has argued that the latest advancement in shoe technology is damaging for running.\"Is Kipchoge an outlier of immense athletic potential? Or is he a simply a very good runner who is benefiting from the immense improvements that his shoes provide? Perhaps both,\" Tucker told CNN last year.\"But the point is we don't know with absolute certainty. Running, especially marathon running, is supposed to be the purest thing humans put themselves through. It's just about feet, legs, lungs, heart and brain. These shoes create the same problems that doping throws up.\"Kipchoge likened running a sub-two hour marathon to Neil Armstrong's historic moon landing in 1969 and the Kenyan sees nothing wrong with the advancement in shoe design.\"They are fair,\" he told the Telegraph newspaper. \"I trained hard. Technology is growing and we can't deny it -- we must go with technology.\"World Athletics president Sebastian Coe said it was not his organization's place to \"regulate the entire sports shoe market,\" but added it should \"preserve the integrity of elite competition.\"The price of Nike's new shoe nor its exact release date has yet to be confirmed.",

        "content": "(CNN)Germany faced a political crisis Thursday after centrist parties breached a decades-old taboo and teamed up with the far-right Alternative for Germany in a regional parliament.Chancellor Angela Merkel made it clear she was outraged after her party, the conservative Christian Democratic Union, voted with the AfD and the liberal Free Democratic Party on Wednesday to elect the FDP's candidate Thomas Kemmerich as the state prime minister in the state of Thuringia in eastern Germany.Merkel called the decision \"unforgivable.\"The vote sparked protests and near universal condemnation from the national leadership of the parties involved. In Erfurt, Thuringia's capital, crowds gathered overnight in front of the State Chancellery. A number of people built tents and brought along sleeping bags, threatening to \"camp against Kemmerich\" until the decision is reversed. Thousands of people were also protesting in front of the FDP headquarters in Berlin.Extreme parties have been kept out of mainstream German politics since the end of the World War II and the decision by the regional CDU and FDP sent shockwaves through the political establishment. Read More\"It's a very big deal ... the consensus amongst democrats that there would be no cooperation with far-right parties ended yesterday,\" Kai Arzheimer, a professor of Political Science at the University of Mainz, told CNN. \"So it was a historic day,\" he added.How a former history teacher led a far-right surge in eastern GermanyKemmerich replaced Bodo Ramelow from the leftist Die Linke party. Ramelow was widely expected to hold onto the role following his party's victory in the Thuringia state elections in October. However, Kemmerich's tenure is likely to be short-lived. Following the protests and the criticism from the national party leaders, Kemmerich announced he would requests the dissolution of the state parliament, a move that would likely lead to new election.The fact that the CDU and the FDP cooperated with the AfD in Thuringia, of all places, adds to the injury. The AfD fraction in the state is known for its radicalism. It is led by Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, an anti-immigrant former history teacher who has previously called Berlin's Holocaust memorial a \"monument of shame.\" He is considered an extremist by the country's intelligence service. An administrative court in Meiningen ruled last year that calling him a \"fascist\" was not a defamation, because the description was \"not based on thin air but in verifiable facts.\"\"They are very radical in this part of the country,\" said . \"[H\u00f6cke] is also the leader of the hardline caucus within the AfD, which are pretty close to traditional German right wing extremism,\" he added.Angela Merkel called for the \"unique\" decision to vote with AfD to \"be reversed, at least for the CDU.\"Outrage and protestsMerkel came out strongly against her party's actions. Speaking during a visit to South Africa, the Chancellor called for the \"unique\" decision to vote with AfD to \"be reversed, at least for the CDU.\"\"It was a day that broke with the values of the CDU and now everything must be done to make it clear that this can in no way be brought in line with what the CDU thinks and does,\" Merkel said. She said the CDU will not participate in any government formed by Kemmerich.Christian Lindner, the federal chairman of the FDP, said he \"would not be able to continue\" if any part of FDP was to \"work systematically with the AfD or accept dependency.\" He called a special meeting of the party's executive board on Friday.One day after the election, locals protest in front of the State Chancellery in Erfurt, eastern Germany.Some critics and political commentators compared the vote on Wednesday to the events of 1930, when the center-right parties in Thuringia were the first in Germany to form a government that included the Nazi Party.Ramelow, who was defeated by Kemmerich, posted a quote from Adolf HitIer from February 1930, in which the Nazi leader praised the party's result in Thuringia. \"We really are the decisive party today. (...) The parties in Thuringia, which previously formed the government, cannot raise a majority without our participation,\" the quote read.  The Chairman of far-right AfD party group in Thuringia, Bjoern Hoecke (right) congratulates Thomas Kemmerich, leader of the state branch of Thuringia's Free Democratic Party and newly elected Prime Minister of Thuringia.Arzheimer said this was not a far-fetched analogy. \"Most of the time, such comparisons muddy the waters, but this is uncanny,\" he said.The vote on Wednesday didn't come out of nowhere. Centrist parties, including the CDU, suffered major losses in the Thuringia's state elections in October, while Die Linke and AfD surged ahead.The rise of the AfD was phenomenal. The party more than doubled its share of voters since the last state election and came in second place after Die Linke.CNN's Sheena McKenzie contributed to this report.",

The victim, identified to CNN as Imran Aliev, ran a YouTube channel criticizing the Chechen regime backed by Russian President Vladimir Putin.French officials said Aliev, 44, \"suffered a violent death.\" Investigators believe he knew his killer, a source close to the investigation told CNN Tuesday.According to the source, two individuals checked into the hotel room last Wednesday; on Thursday at approximately 11 a.m. local time the manager went to check on the guests and discovered Aliev's body. Read MoreThe second man had disappeared. A manhunt is underway to find the 35-year-old Chechen man who police believe is the number one suspect, the source told CNN. A knife found at the scene has been sent to a forensic laboratory for analysis, according to the source. Police suspect motive is politicalPolice have launched a murder investigation, but no arrests have been made.The source said police believe the motive for the killing may be political. It is the latest in a number of high-profile murders of Chechen dissidents living in Europe in recent years, with rights groups warning the killings are a warning from Moscow. Musa Taipov, a Chechen journalist who lives in France, pointed the finger at Moscow in a Facebook post about his friend Aliev's death. \"I strongly suspect Russia, in through its special services, extremely interested in the conflict, in the civil strife between the peoples of the Caucasus,\" he wrote on Facebook last week.CNN contacted the Kremlin for comment, but had not received a response at time of publishing.Aliev had four children and lived in Belgium, Taipov said, adding that he had been \"in constant contact on WhatsApp,\" with him.   Murder a 'warning to others'Mansur Sadulaev, who is chairman of the Chechen Human Rights Association (VAYFOND), based in Sweden, told CNN that Aliev was known for his \"harsh and offensive remarks\" about people of the Caucasus as well as his criticism of the Chechen regime. Sadulaev also blames Moscow for the murder. \"He was killed as a warning to others, thus trying to intimidate everyone who criticizes 'Russian prot\u00e9g\u00e9' in Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov.\"Kadyrov is a former warlord known for his brutality -- and for his allegiance to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\"Opponents of the Russian regime and supporters of the independence of the Chechen Republic, especially those who express themselves openly, are in constant danger both in the EU and in any other country,\" Sadulaev said.\"Among the many murders and murder attempts on opponents of the Russian regime there is the recent assassination of Zelimkhan Khangoshvili in Berlin,\" Sadulaev added.Chechen dissident Zelimkhan Khangoshvili was shot and killed in Berlin in August while on his way to midday prayers at a nearby mosque. Khangoshvili had fought in the second Chechen war, alongside fellow Chechen insurgents against Russian federal forces. A suspect, who was carrying a Russian passport, was arrested within hours.But months later, the case is still in limbo: the suspect won't talk, the Kremlin denies involvement, and Germany refuses to point the finger at Moscow without definitive evidence.CNN's Darya Tarasova contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)It is perhaps no surprise English Premier League leaders Liverpool recorded another victory Tuesday -- but the fact it was achieved with manager Jurgen Klopp and the club's star players controversially on holiday has raised eyebrows.Many of Liverpool's players flew off to sunnier climates after the weekend league win over Southampton to make the most of the first EPL winter break -- Fabinho and Firmino jetted off with their families to the Maldives, Georginio Wijnaldum has been in Dubai, while Adam Lallana relaxed in Miami. But most contentious of all was the non-attendance of Klopp at Anfield for the FA Cup tie, with Under-23 manager Neil Critchley taking charge of the youngest team in Liverpool's history as it beat Shrewsbury Town 1-0 to set up a fifth-round clash against Chelsea.

The German would not have been the only one watching remotely, with senior squad goalkeeper Adrian posting a picture on Twitter of him watching online. Read MoreKlopp's decision to rest his senior players as they aim to win the club's first league title in 30 years and retain the European Cup was vindicated by the result, however.          View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Lari Firmino (@larissa_peereira) on Feb 4, 2020 at 11:14am PST The lively encounter at a sold-out Anfield was settled after Ro-Shaun Williams headed into his own net after Neco Williams' long ball into the Shrewsbury box.Shrewsbury, which plays in the third tier of English football and forced a replay after a shock 2-2 draw last month, had a goal ruled out by the video assistant referee at the start of the second half.But Liverpool's young guns created most of the game's chances -- recording 12 shots to their opponent's three -- and were deserving of the victory.\"Obviously with young players you're never quite sure, but I have to say from the first whistle the maturity those young boys showed to play that game was remarkable,\" Critchley, who also oversaw a youthful LIverpool team in a 5-0 League Cup defeat by Aston Villa earlier in the season, told the club website. \"They actually calmed me on the side and I think over 90 minutes we had the better chances and were just about the deserved winners on the night.\"Critchley added that regular first team manager Klopp had been in touch with advice throughout the day, while veteran midfielder James Milner watched on from the sidelines. Liverpool players celebrate taking the leadagainst Shrewsbury Town.The English Football Association has been criticized for scheduling FA Cup replays during the winter break, with Liverpool fan and YouTube presenter Paul Machin telling CNN Sport Tuesday that the competition was being \"mismanaged,\" encouraging bigger teams not to take it seriously.The FA, however, defended its position.\"Prior to the start of the 2019/20 season, all clubs accepted that FA Cup fourth round replays, where required, would have to take place during the first week of the mid-season player break,\" it told CNN in a statement. As Liverpool deliberately fields a youthful side, is the FA Cup 'damaging itself?'The Reds next face a trip to Stamford Bridge in the FA Cup having given their youngsters the chance to experience a 50,000-strong crowd at Anfield. \"I've been fortunate enough to be on the pitch when the first team have scored, I've been fortunate enough to be on the bench and as a fan you know how loud it gets,\" captain Jones told the club website. \"As I said it was an amazing feeling to captain the boys, but I think the most important thing is that we came away with a win and now we can have our break and look forward to the next round against Chelsea.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Are we witnessing the start of a thrilling new NBA rivalry? The signs looked good when rookie prodigies Zion Williamson and Ja Morant went toe-to-toe in the NBA for the first time Friday.The pair, who have already made a big splash in the league, were the 2019 NBA Draft's No.1 and No.2 picks respectively, and their  first head-to-head suggested the makings of a famous duel.The match up had fans salivating over the prospect of another rivalry to echo Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan and Patrick Ewing, or Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant.But their bond runs deeper than just being the top two draft picks after they played together in South Carolina in the early days.Read More\"He knows he's my brother,\" said Williamson after they traded jerseys and smiled for cameras following Friday's clash. But he added: \"We are going to be rivals. That's just the South Carolina nature: to be dogs and go at each other.\"Off the court we know it's all love, but on the court we're trying to win.\"READ: Zion Williamson stuns for New Orleans Pelicans in record-breaking NBA debutWilliamson (left) and Morant swapped jerseys after the game.A rivalry is bornWhile Williamson's Pelicans won, the result was secondary to the battle between the two on court.The styles between the two contrasted greatly. Williamson is brutish, explosive, exhibiting superhuman power in his dunks. His jump off defies gravity.Morant is more graceful. He floats the ball into the basket with finger rolls and gliding jump shots.But the similarities become clearer the more you watch.READ: Why Italy remembers Kobe Bryant 'as a son, not as a star'Williamson scored 22 points on his NBA debut.The way Williamson escapes coverage and finds space is smooth and subtle, surprising considering his six-foot-six-inch, 285 pound (129kg) frame.And Morant isn't afraid to get physical despite his slighter stature. Despite Williamson's propensity to dunk, Morant had the better dunk on the night, a two-handed slam from a Dillon Brooks lob.Williamson won the statistical battle in that first encounter, scoring 24 points and recording six rebounds and three assists. Morant had 16 points, only one rebound and three assists.Since then, Williamson has recorded his second double-double (double digit figures in two scoring categories), taking the Houston Rockets for 21 points and 10 rebounds.Williamson now has two double-doubles and while Morant has eight, he has played 44 games to Williamson's six.Neither have a much-coveted triple-double just yet, but on the face of their career performances so far, it won't be long before one gets there.Ja Morant leads all rookies in points per game and assists per game.The origin storiesMorant's path to the NBA couldn't have been more different from Williamson's. They briefly played together for the South Carolina Hornets in the Amateur Athletic Union during high school, but that's where their paths split.Coming out of high school, Williamson was a consensus five-star recruit. ESPN had him as the second-best high school basketball player in the nation, while 247Sports had him as the best. He received offers from 16 NCAA Division 1 programs, and on a live ESPN telecast he committed to Duke, a blue-chip college program led by legendary college basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski.Williamson has had cameras on him ever since.At Duke, he played only one season. That was all he needed to make his mark. READ: Zion Williamson is set to make millions in the NBA, but a $100 million lawsuit stands in the wayWilliamson only played one dominant year at Duke University before declaring for the NBA Draft.Video clips of him dunking in increasingly theatrical and athletic ways went viral. He averaged 22.6 points per game (PPG) and 8.9 rebounds per game (RPG), and was certain to be the No. 1 overall selection as soon as he declared for the NBA Draft.Whenever he has played -- be it at college or now in the NBA -- the team result seems almost secondary to how Williamson performs. He recently said the attention he receives \"is a lot to take in sometimes.\"Morant has had a very different journey to the NBA. He was not ranked coming out of high school and an offer from South Carolina was the only top-tier Division 1 college that reached out to him. He ended up committing instead to Murray State, a mid-tier college that plays in the lesser known Ohio Valley Conference.In his rookie season at Murray State, Morant recorded a modest 12.7 PPG and 6.5 RPG but an encouraging 6.2 assists per game (APG). He took off from there. In his sophomore season, while his RPG decreased to 5.7, he made up for it in an increased PPG of 24.5 and his record of 10.0 APG was the best in all of Division 1 basketball. Morant hasn't looked back.The big leaguesWhile Williamson has been out with injury for most of the year, the 20-year-old Morant has established himself as frontrunner for NBA Rookie of the Year.He's won two Rookie of the Month awards already and as of February 4 has recorded an average of 17.3 PPG, 7.1 APG and 3.4 RPG. Morant also ranks 12th on the overall list for APG and among rookies he ranks top for PPG and APG.He has exceeded expectation, even for a No. 2 overall selection, narrowly missing out on selection for the NBA All-Star game.While Morant made his mark, Williamson was on the sidelines recovering from arthroscopic knee surgery after picking up an injury in preseason.yesssir \ud83e\udd2b @Zionwilliamson\u2014 Ja Morant (@JaMorant) January 23, 2020 SOUTH CAROLINA I KNOW YALL LOVING THIS \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd\u2014 Ja Morant (@JaMorant) January 23, 2020 Morant has been supportive of Williamson, tweeting a series of positive messages during the 19-year-old's NBA debut.Their teams are both part of the Southwestern Division in the NBA, meaning they will face each other four times a season.

        "content": "(CNN)Esow Alben was just three years of age when the deadly tsunami struck the Andaman and Nicobar Islands on Boxing Day 2004.More than 2,000 people lost their lives in the trail of utter devastation that followed on the remote archipelago some 1,400 kilometers from the Indian mainland.Esow was fortunate to live with his family in a property on high ground above the capital Port Blair so escaped unscathed, unlike so many others on that fateful day.Fast forward to 2020 and the now teenage Esow is making headlines for his birthplace for very different reasons, a beacon of hope for the future after the terrors and uncertainty of the past.The 18-year-old is the rising young star of Indian sport, tipped for the top in the highly specialist sport of track cycling, but mature enough to realize his greater responsibilities. Read More\"I want to be an ambassador for both the islands and for India,\" Esow told CNN.The victorious Indian team after receiving their gold medals for the team sprint in the 2019 world junior track championships in Germany.'Aim for the diamond'In an unprecedented achievement, India, led by Esow, won the gold medal in the team sprint at the world junior championships in Germany last year, stunning Australia in the final. He also bagged individual medals in both the sprint and his favored event of the keirin. Now entering the senior ranks, Esow has the 2024 Olympics in Paris in his sights and top step on the podium. \"My coach tells me to aim for the diamond and you can settle for the gold,\" he said with a smile.Esow's exploits have not gone unnoticed and earned him an invite to the prestigious Berlin Sechstagerennen (Six Day) event in the German capital, where he quickly made his mark against competitors vastly more experienced, including the Olympic silver medalist and nine-time Berlin Six Day Sprint champion Maximilian Levy of Germany. The first Indian to compete in the 109th staging of the event, he was accompanied by his favorite Bollywood-style music as he circled the 250-meter velodrome ahead of his timed individual attempts over one-lap.A personal best for Esow Alben, the first Indian rider to compete at #SixDay \ud83d\udc99#SixDayBerlin pic.twitter.com/hJEs5Lkz55\u2014 Six Day (@sixdaycycling) January 27, 2020 With a squat and muscular build, Esow has all the physical tools for track sprinting and reached speeds well in excess of 70 kph (44 mph) before lunging for the line to extract the last millisecond for the timed effort. As expected, Levy dominated the competition, but on the penultimate night had to make way for the young upstart as Esow kept him at bay and then powered past Tomas Babek of the Czech Republic, a former world championship silver medalist, to win the keirin event. Other outright wins escaped him, but Esow had already become a crowd favorite with his attacking style and showboating antics. \"I'm a showman, I like to play to the crowd,\" he said. \"It's such a great honor to race here and I like to give something back.\" Esow played to the packed crowd at the Berlin Velodrome with showman antics.First loveIn a country where cricket dominates the front and back page headlines, Esow's achievements are gaining traction among the wider Indian public, a scenario all the more remarkable given where he hails from.The makeshift cycling track on the islands was destroyed by the 2004 tsunami, but this did not stop the young Esow from trying to emulate his father, who was a keen cyclist himself.As a child he did try cricket. \"I played when I was eight years old, but not too much,\" he said. His talents clearly lay in other areas, his powerful physique better suited to individual non-ball sports. The Sports Authority India (SAI) came calling in 2014 after Esow took part in a series of trials to test his aptitude in various sports. He was initially pointed in the direction of rowing, picked to attend a special sports school in Port Blair, but he quickly switched to his first love of cycling. Esow (third left) and the other Berlin Six Day sprinters are sprayed with champagne by retiring former Olympic gold medallist Miriam Welte (far right) at a ceremony on the final night of competition.A silver medal at the Under-15 national track championships in 2015 kickstarted his meteoric rise and Esow was fast tracked to India's national cycling training center in New Delhi. The Indian capital hosted the 2010 Commonwealth Games, and with it came much-needed new sports stadia, including a 250-meter indoor cycling velodrome, the first in the country and a must for international level training and competition. The cost of providing these facilities and the other infrastructure, with millions of Indians still living in grinding poverty, plus problems with the organization in the build-up to the event, left many to question the wisdom of India hosting such a major Games. However, the SAI did take the opportunity to up its game, including a fledgling development program for track cycling, purchasing the specialist bike equipment from a British-based manufacturer. Riding with a smile on his face. Esow relished the experience of mixing it with the big guns in Berlin.National coach RK Sharma, who accompanied his prodigy Esow to Berlin, believes it has been the vital ingredient in their success. \"There was a lot of controversy about India hosting the Commonwealth Games, but because of them we have world-class stadiums in Delhi and most of the national teams are making use of them,\" Sharma told CNN. A former national standard cyclist who took retirement from the Indian Air Force before embarking on his coaching career, Sharma has overseen a program that is producing a string of world class junior sprinters. Esow's teammates in the golden team sprint triumph, Y Rojit Singh and L Ronaldo Singh, still have another year in junior ranks, with the latter ranked world No.1 in the sprint and keirin individual disciplines, so the future looks bright. Tasting success: Esow shows off his gold medal from the world junior track championships.Young female Indian sprinters are also in the upper echelons of the world junior rankings, no doubt inspired by the achievements of Deborah Harold, who also hails from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and was nine years old when the tsunami struck.In the chaos, she was swept away from the grip of her parents and only survived by climbing up a tree while the torrent raged below her. She later attended the same sports institute in Port Blair as Esow, progressing to win medals at Asian championship levels and qualifying for senior world championship events. Harold's achievements aside, Esow is the first athlete from the islands to make their mark on the world stage in any sport and hopes to prove an inspiration to others. Esow Alben takes one of the sprint heats at the Berlin Six Day with a typical head down lunge for the line.'Like an elder brother'He takes his inspiration from Malaysia's pocket rocket Azizulhasni Awang, who has led the way in Asian cycling with a gold medal at the 2017 world championships in the keirin and bronze in that discipline at the 2016 Olympics in Rio. The two faced each other in the quarterfinals of the sprint competition at the Asian Games last year and Awang was impressed by his young rival. \"He came to the pit and asked how old is he?\" said Sharma, who told the Malaysian he was just 18 years old. \"I had such a tough time with him,\" said Awang. \ud83c\udfa5Watch Indian cycling prodigy Esow Alben win the Gold medal in the Keirin event at the Six Day Cycling Series in Berlin! pic.twitter.com/XpKdVGGEWT\u2014 The Bridge (@TheBridge_IN) January 28, 2020 The step up from junior to senior competition is a steep one and to beat the likes of Awang and Levy on a regular basis will require year after year of intensive training at the national center in Delhi. The last three years has seen the Indian youngsters attend the summer training camp in Cottbus, Germany, with Levy taking a particular interest in Esow. \"Max has been like an elder brother to Esow, helping him and guiding him,\" said Sharma. The Indian team were at the Cottbus track on the fateful day in June 2018 when German Olympic star Kristina Vogel suffered life-changing injuries in a horror crash in training. Kristina Vogel: Paralyzed cycling star turns to politics Hungry for successThe accident is a reminder of the dangers of track cycling as riders race around steep velodromes at high speeds on a fixed-wheel bike with no brakes. Esow's hero Awang infamously had his leg pierced through by a 20-centimeter-long wood splinter after crashing at a World Cup event in 2011, and the young star has had a few tumbles on the way. \"I focus them a lot on technique and balance,\" said Sharma. \"But racing within inches of each other at 70 kph, accidents sometimes happen.\" In a sport dominated by traditional cycling nations, securing places at the 2024 Olympics will be no mean feat, with Sharma targeting 2022 as an important year, with both the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, England and the Asian Games in Hangzhou, China. The year will also mark the start of the qualification period for Paris 2024, with points being awarded at World Cup events and the world championships. Esow with his own Usain Bolt-style celebration after a race win in Berlin.Both Esow and Sharma are hungry for success. \"If we can win at junior level, why not elite?\" said Sharma. \"I want to see our national flag on top at Olympic (Games),\" is the intro to Esow's Facebook page. Previous Indian success at Olympic Games has mostly come from its field hockey teams with eight of its nine golds, but there is a growing recognition that track cycling can provide the route to more medals.

        "content": "(CNN)Barcelona's teenage sensation Ansu Fati was left pinching himself after the first double of his fledgling career earned the club a narrow 2-1 win over Levante.The 17-year-old repaid the faith shown in him by coach Quique Setien, who has given Fati a place in the starting XI four times in his five matches in charge, linking up twice with Lionel Messi in the space of 90 seconds to fire Barcelona into a 2-0 first-half lead.He's the first 17-year-old to score a double in a La Liga game.There was an element of fortune to the goals, both of which squirmed through Levant goalkeeper Aitor Fern\u00e1ndez, but the combination of Fati and Messi was a bright spot in an otherwise underwhelming match for Barcelona.\"This is all a dream,\" Fati told reporters after the match. \"I dreamed of moments like this and I want to thank my teammates and my coach for giving me another opportunity. Read More\"It's not easy to come into a team like this as a young boy but I'm very grateful for the support I've had. I've still got a lot more to come, I like playing with Messi -- it's a dream to play alongside him -- but I want to continue fighting for my place.\"In truth, Levante -- which beat Barcelona 3-1 in the reverse fixture earlier this season -- really should have come away with at least a point from this clash after squandering several clear-cut opportunities in the second half.Ansu Fati celebrateshis goal with Lionel Messi.READ: Cristiano Ronaldo hits goal-scoring milestone for JuventusREAD: Teen sensation Erling Braut H\u00e5land continues incredible scoring record with another braceWhen Ruben Rochina did finally find the back of the net via a deflection in stoppage time, there was still time for the Spaniard to miss one final chance to earn his side a draw.The victory lifts Barcelona to within three points of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga but the team's performances will continue to concern Setien, who is still tweaking the team in search of the perfect formula.Antoine Griezmann's patchy form in front of goal -- the Frenchman missed two brilliant chances in the first half to extend his side's lead -- will be another worry for Setien.'Smells like a star'Long-term injuries to Luis Suarez and Ousmane Dembele mean Fati is likely to get even more chances to impress this season.The Guinea-Bissau-born forward, who is also eligible to play for Spain, became Barcelona's youngest goalscorer in La Liga when he netted against Osasuna in August, aged 16.He made history again in December with a goal against Inter Milan in the Champions League to become the competition's youngest ever goalscorer.Ansu Fati celebrates after giving Barcelona the lead.In a thinly veiled dig at several of Real Madrid's misfiring stars, newspaper Sport wrote: \"Ansu Fati has scored as many goals as Vinicius, Rodrygo and (Luka) Jovic combined in La Liga.\"Fati's double against Levante allows him to match the overall goal total of the three (young) promises of Real Madrid in La Liga.\"Rival newspaper Diario AS said: \"Ansu smells like a star.\"Despite being only 17, the development of the ... child prodigy excites the club. He makes good decisions on the pitch and is taking the right steps in his personal life.\"Such was Fati's confidence after netting twice, the teenager tried an audacious bicycle kick to complete his hattrick but his effort flashed just wide of the goal.If he continues in the same vein, it won't be long before he's making history as La Liga's youngest player to score a treble.",

Our Country is PROUD OF YOU!\"Trump's original tweet was quickly deleted, but not before it was shared widely.Congratulations to the Kansas City Chiefs on a great game and a fantastic comeback under immense pressure. We are proud of you and the Great State of Missouri. You are true Champions!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2020 The Chiefs aren't from Kansas. They have always hailed from Kansas' neighboring state of Missouri.Read MoreTrump then deleted the tweet, re-posting a new one congratulating Missouri, though he wasn't quick enough for the keen-eyed on social media to point out his error.In contrast, the 24-year-old Mahomes knew exactly what he was doing, though it took some cajoling to persuade his teammates.Magic MahomesTrailing 20-10 in the fourth quarter, with 12 minutes on the clock, Mahomes had thrown his second interception of the game.It seemed almost certain at that point that the Vince Lombardi trophy would be heading to San Francisco for a record-equaling sixth time.But the Chiefs' quarterback had other ideas.He drove his side on, and completed two touchdown passes to send the Chiefs charging into the lead. A rushing touchdown by Damien Williams took their tally to 31 and they sealed their first Super Bowl victory in 50 years. Mahomes was crowned Super Bowl MVP after leading his team to victory, throwing two touchdowns and rushing for a touchdown too.It was an inspired revival, but Mahomes had already made a habit of dragging his team back from the brink in this year's NFL Playoffs.Against the Texans in the Divisional Round, the Chiefs trailed 24-0 but went on to win 51-31.In the AFC Championship, they trailed 17-7 but triumphed 35-24.It seems Mahomes just has a knack for inspiring those around him to believe and play positively, just like him.Wide receiver Tyreek Hill gave a glimpse into the boost Mahomes gives the team: \"He was encouraging us, telling us to believe. You know, we were down 20-10 and he was telling us to believe in the fourth quarter. He (saw) it in some guys' eyes, they were getting down, including myself. I was like, 'Man, how are we going to pull this off?'\"And he was like, '(No.) 10 (Hill's jersey number), you've got to believe, brother. Like the same faith you've had all of your career, you've got to believe right now. It's going to happen, man. I can feel it.'\"Safety Daniel Sorensen said Mahomes' talent helps, too.\"We know that, as a defense, 'Look, get Pat the ball back and he can do things that are really special.' He can score in a hurry, and that's what we were able to do,\" said Sorensen.Mahomes is the youngest quarterback ever to win both the Super Bowl and NFL MVP award, which he did last year as a 23-year-old.He is also only the third African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl, joining Doug Williams (with Washington in Super Bowl XXII in 1988) and Russell Wilson (Seattle, Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014).Speaking about this feat, Mahomes told CNN: \"I think it just means, no matter where you come from, now matter how you were raised or what race you are, you can go out and follow your dreams. \"That's what I've always believed. No one thought I was going to be a football player. \"Everyone thought I was going to be a baseball player, but I followed my dreams and now I'm here, winning the Super Bowl with all my teammates.\"",

Fifteen of the last 16 Super Bowls have featured an AFC team led by Tom Brady, Ben Roethlisberger, or Peyton Manning at the quarterback position. But not this year. It will be reigning league MVP Patrick Mahomes leading the Chiefs against the 49ers on Sunday.Mahomes will become just the seventh African American quarterback to start in a Super Bowl. He could become the third to win it, joining Doug Williams (with Washington in Super Bowl XXII in 1988) and Russell Wilson (Seattle, Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014).Laurent Duvernay-Tardif: The first medical doctor playing in the NFL is in Super Bowl LIV\"My grandpa was a Redskins fan because of Doug Williams, and the way that he was able to be the Super Bowl MVP and do all those different things -- a little bit before my time,\" Mahomes said Tuesday. \"With me, when I first got to Kansas City, I had the honor to have Mike Vick in the QB room in our training camp.Read More\"The way that he talked about the game and he talked about how he executed it and then he talked about how he listened to Coach Reid and it took his game to another level.

Right behind him was Dak Prescott, with 4,902.Super Bowl Opening Night: Chiefs and 49ers react to death of Kobe BryantLamar Jackson was unanimously voted NFL MVP at NFL Honors, becoming the second-youngest person to receive the award. And Jackson wasn't the only African American quarterback in the conversation. Wilson, Mahomes and Deshaun Watson were some of the top candidates. They all led their teams to the divisional round of this season's playoffs.And they could dominate the NFL for years to come. Jackson (23), Mahomes (24) and Watson (24) are all under 25 years old. Which is why the 2019 season has been known as \"the year of the black quarterback.\"Lamar Jackson was voted NFL MVP at just 23 years old.\"It feels good to know we're having an impact,\" Watson told The Undefeated. \"Our performance gives the young guys a lot more confidence -- seeing us at a young age, especially African American quarterbacks having all this success we're having in the NFL.\"Jackson told The Undefeated, \"There's a lot of us who have a ton of talent but we fail because of the lack of confidence, maybe because of our environment. Those guys can look up to guys like me who are here. They see us perform. They know where we came from, that can inspire them to be where we are.\"When Mahomes won MVP a year ago, he became the third African American quarterback to win the award, joining Cam Newton (2015 season) and Steve McNair (co-MVP with Manning in 2003).Deshaun Watson led the Texans to the divisional round of the playoffs this season.\"The best thing about it is that you're showing kids that no matter where you grow up, or what race you are or whatever it is, that you can achieve your dream,\" Mahomes said Tuesday. \"For me, being a black quarterback -- having a black dad with a white mom -- it just shows that it doesn't matter where you come from. It doesn't matter if you're a baseball player or basketball player, or whatever it is. Just follow your dreams.\"Whatever your dreams are, put the work ethic in, and you can be there at the end of the day.\"Mahomes' turn to play in a Super BowlThat wasn't always the case. Far from it. Minority quarterbacks were thought to be pariahs -- or rare exceptions to the rule.Roger Goodell on Antonio Brown: 'We want to help get him on the right track'Willie Thrower of the Chicago Bears was the first modern-era African American quarterback to play in the NFL, in 1953. In 1968, Marlin Briscoe, with the Denver Broncos, was the first black quarterback to start a regular season game in the Super Bowl era, but he eventually was moved to wide receiver. A decade later, Williams became the first black quarterback drafted in NFL history.Warren Moon, meanwhile, was a Pac-8 co-player of the year and a Rose Bowl MVP when he was at the University of Washington. Yet he was not drafted into the NFL in 1978. Instead, he signed with the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League and won five Grey Cup championships before playing 17 seasons in the NFL. To this day, he's the only African American quarterback in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.When Vick was drafted No. 1 overall in 2001, he became the face of the league and changed the game completely. Other African American quarterbacks throughout the years, like Randall Cunningham, McNair, and Newton helped pave the way for those who are playing today. 49ers' Katie Sowers is the first woman and openly gay coach in Super Bowl historyIn addition to Williams and Wilson, McNair, Donovan McNabb, Colin Kaepernick and Newton all played in Super Bowls. Now it's Mahomes' turn.\"(MVP) is a hard award to win,\" Mahomes said a year ago after earning the honor.Then he said this: \"Hopefully the next one I can get is a Super Bowl.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Be it trying to become the all-time men's grand slam leader or simply needing a spark in matches, Novak Djokovic said after winning a record eighth Australian Open title that his motivation comes from when times were tougher for the Serb and his family. Djokovic's desire and quality could very well take him past closest rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal in majors, especially since at 32 he is a year younger than the Spaniard and six years the Swiss' junior. Novak + Melbourne = \ud83c\udfc6\u2764\ufe0f@DjokerNole | #AusOpen | #AO2020 pic.twitter.com/Vo438ewmoo\u2014 #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) February 3, 2020 His 17th grand slam title has once again pulled him to within two of Nadal but he has closed to within three of Federer for the first time ever. After winning a grand slam title for the first time when trailing in a final two sets to one -- Dominic Thiem was his unlucky opponent in Melbourne -- Djokovic reflected on life growing up in the war-torn former Yugoslavia. \"My upbringing was in Serbia during several wars during the '90s, difficult time, embargo in our country where we had to wait in line for bread, milk, water, some basic things in life,\" Djokovic said to reporters in a press conference that started in the early hours of Monday morning after the four-hour thriller at Rod Laver Arena.

'From literally nothing'Looking down and almost out against Thiem after the third set, he dug deep and stormed back, aided by his early hardship in life. \"That probably has been my foundation, the very fact that I came from literally nothing and difficult life circumstances together with my family and with my people,\" he said.\"Going back to that, reminding myself where I came from always inspires me, motivates me to push even harder.\"That's probably one of the reasons why I managed to find that extra gear or necessary, I guess, mental strength to overcome challenges when they present themselves.\"READ: Novak Djokovic rallies to win his eighth Australian Open title     RespectDjokovic told the New York Times in a story published last month that at one stage, his family was down to its last 10 dollars. He doesn't need to worry about money any more. He passed the $140 million mark in prize money when pocketing more than $2 million for his efforts Sunday. He told the Times that he would tell his two kids -- 5-year-old son Stefan and 2-year-old daughter Tara -- about his family's early struggles, to a degree. Along with wife Jelena, they reside in Monte Carlo, their days apparently beginning with hugging and singing sessions.  READ: Sofia Kenin wins first grand slam title\"I definitely don't want my kids to go, 'Oh, my God. Here he goes again, saying 'I didn't have this, I never had that, and you have everything,''\" he said. \"I don't want that because my kids are born in this family in this way and these circumstances, and I respect that.\"Djokovic has the respect of everyone in the tennis world, albeit he generally still trails Federer and Nadal in crowd support. It was when he started winning multiple majors in a season, more than once, that he thought getting close to Federer's leading tally was a possibility. Djokovic (left) defeated Thiem in five sets having trailed 2-1 to the Austrian in the final. Confidence boostDjokovic ended Federer's hopes of major No. 21 by beating him in straight sets in Thursday's semifinal.  \"Especially the first part of my career, I was dreaming of winning as many grand slams as possible,\" he said. \"When I started winning a couple of grand slams a year, a few years in a row, that's where I felt actually I can maybe challenge Roger and Pete Sampras, all these guys that were winning most grand slams in their careers in the history of tennis,\" he added, referring to the American who held the men's record of 14 majors before the incredible Big Three emerged. READ: Martina Navratilova and John McEnroe 'sorry' for breaking protocolFast forward to the end of last season and his longtime coach, Marian Vajda -- now working alongside former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic -- told CNN that winning all three of his singles matches in the Davis Cup after Djokovic surprisingly exited in the group stage of the ATP Finals was pivotal to restore confidence.  Djokovic then led Serbia to the title at the inaugural ATP Cup in Australia ahead of the year's first major -- he beat Nadal in the final -- receiving some of the best fan support of his career. JUST WATCHEDNovak Djokovic reflects on Wimbledon victoryReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNovak Djokovic reflects on Wimbledon victory 00:54The Davis Cup \"leveled his confidence a little bit, ending the season by winning matches.

Obviously, I was very pleased with his performance at the ATP Cup. \"All the guys played excellent tennis, the level was really good from everybody. At the beginning of the year to be ready already, that was really good. \"I liked the final against Spain where he played a really great match against Rafa. Obviously kept him in really good shape.\"Another pleasing aspect about Djokovic has been his maturity, according to Vajda. \"In the past it was kind of more difficult with him to work because he was sometimes unpredictable and emotional a little bit,\" said Vajda. \"But now I think he is more stable and knows what he wants and you can see in his game, he is quite confident.\"In the early stages of 2020, Djokovic is the player to beat on the men's tour.",

He was being followed by surveillance officers who shot him dead at the scene, police said.\"Although the suspect has not been formally identified, given the circumstances of the incident, we are confident that he was Sudesh Amman,\" Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Lucy D'Orsi announced.Police earlier called the attack a terrorist incident and said it was believed to be \"Islamist-related.\" UK police named the south London attacker as 20-year-old Sudesh Amman.Amman stabbed two people on Streatham High Road at about 2 p.m. before the surveillance officers caught up with him and shot him dead,  D'Orsi said. She said he was wearing what was quickly established to be a hoax device.Read MoreThree people were taken to nearby hospitals -- two with stab wounds and another who police believe was hit by glass when Amman was shot. One of the victims who was initially described as having life-threatening injuries was out of danger on Monday, police said.Amman served less than half his three-year, four-month sentence for terrorism offenses, and was released from prison January 22, police said.  Authorities had concerns about the man's behavior, including language that suggested he continued to hold extremist views, but he had to be released under current laws, a source in the UK government told CNN. He was released with strict licensing conditions, including a curfew, and he was kept under surveillance.In apparent response to the attacker's previous terror convictions, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that on Monday he would be announcing \"further plans for fundamental changes to the system for dealing with those convicted of terrorism offenses.\"Early Monday, detectives from the Metropolitan Police Service's Counter Terrorism Command began searching two residential addresses in south London and Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, according to a police statement.\"No arrests have been made and enquiries continue at pace,\" the statement added.     Police provided a timeline of the attack on Monday, saying Amman was followed by armed officers as he left an address in the Streatham area shortly after 1:20 p.m. Sunday.Citing initial witness statements, police said he stole a knife from a shop and ran out as he was chased by a member of staff.\"As he ran from the shop, he removed packaging from the knife and once outside attacked two members of public,\" police said.\"The time from him entering the shop to beginning his attack outside was approximately 60 seconds.

Chasing Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal for most of his career, Djokovic became the first man in the Open Era to win a grand slam title in three decades by downing big-hitter Dominic Thiem 6-4 4-6 2-6 6-3 6-4 in an unforgettable three-hour, 59-minute final. He has never lost a finale in Melbourne and has now tallied a 17th major overall to pull closer to Federer and Nadal.  \"Obviously at this stage of my career, grand slams are the ones I value the most,\" said Djokovic. \"They are the ones I prioritize. Before the season starts I try to set my form, shape for these events where I can be at my prime tennis, mental and physical abilities.\"The elder pair will get their chances to equal the Serb's three-decade accomplishment in 2020 but at the year's first grand slam, he is unquestionably in a class of his own.

Given a time violation warning by Dumusois -- Djokovic has long taken his time ahead of serves like Nadal -- the Frenchman issued him another warning in the same game when he exceeded the 25-second limit. That meant he was docked a first serve. The same thing happened to Nadal in last year's US Open final, albeit with a different umpire.Djokovic then tapped Dumusois on the shoe as he made his way to his chair. Once seated, he told Dumusois: \"Great job, man. You made yourself famous, well done.\"Dumusois was lenient in not penalizing Djokovic further for making contact with him, ensuring things didn't escalate.Djokovic pats the feet of the umpire in a heated exchange. READ: Eliud Kipchoge's record-breaking Nike shoes to be bannedThe last time Djokovic and Thiem met at a grand slam, the 32-year-old also lost his cool when given a time violation in the 2019 French Open semifinals. \"I thought that the second violation was not necessary,\" said Djokovic. \"The first one, fine, no problem. The second one, it's just not necessary under the circumstances for a experienced chair umpire. I thought probably he could have reacted a little bit better in that situation.\"Whether he was rocked by Sunday's incident or feeling something physically -- factoring in, too, Thiem's improved play -- Djokovic waned on a nippy Melbourne evening and it felt like an upset was on the cards. But Thiem, now 0-3 in grand slam finals, didn't have any regrets.  \"Of course, there were some small mistakes here and there, but they're happening,\" he said. \"At the end it was a super close five-setter.\"Down 4-1 in the third, the trainer visited Djokovic. He later told reporters he felt dizzy and lost his energy. He left the court with the doctor at the end of the set and once he returned, seemed completely re-energized. He additionally mostly put away the drop shot, which fluctuated in its success rate.      Kobe tribute Fifth-ranked Thiem cracked at 3-4 to help Djokovic nab the fourth set and a considerable statistical edge. While Djokovic held a 30-10 record in fifth sets, Thiem was a mediocre 8-6. The trend ultimately continued, Thiem erring to crucially concede serve at 1-2. It was far from over, though, since Thiem manufactured two break points immediately. And he had chances on both, erring on a forehand into the net with Djokovic in trouble and missing a backhand pass long down the line. The latter was more difficult but given Thiem's propensity to hit flashy winners, he'd like the shot back.  Thiem hung on by delivering a potent serve on break point at 2-4, and it was then Djokovic's turn to escape a jam, at 15-30. There was no drama in the final game. Djokovic served it out to 15 when Thiem's forehand went wide. Djokovic gave an emotional speech when receiving his trophy, telling the crowd to \"stick together\" during tough times whilst paying tribute to his \"mentor\" Kobe Bryant. \"There were some devastating things that started 2020, with huge bushfires here in Australia, conflicts in parts of the world with people dying every day,\" he said.  \"One person that I considered close in my life, Kobe Bryant, passed away as well with his daughter. \"This is a reminder that we should stick together more than ever and be with our families. Stay close to the people who love you, that care about you.\"Thiem had looked the more likely to win during some points of the match. 17 and counting Djokovic still hasn't lost a match since the year began. Serbia triumphed in the inaugural ATP Cup and, maybe just as important, Djokovic received some of the most vocal fan support of his career. He has always wanted to be loved -- Federer and Nadal surpass him on that front -- and he got his wish. \"It played a role and a factor\" in Djokovic's Australian summer, his coach Marian Vajda told CNN. \"It's an engine.\"He seemed to slightly edge the support early in the final, with those on Rod Laver Arena subsequently getting behind Thiem when he fell behind 4-1.  Djokovic recently downplayed the importance of becoming the men's all-time grand slam leader but he'd no doubt still like to get there. He trails Nadal by two and Federer by three. As a bonus, he will usurp Nadal as the world No. 1 in the rankings come Monday.With Djokovic, Nadal and Federer winning the previous 12 majors, Thiem's task was always going to be extremely difficult. \"These guys brought tennis to a complete new level,\" said Thiem. \"They also brought me probably to a much better level. Of course, it would be or it was easier for sure in a different era to win big titles. That's 100%.\"But I'm happy I can compete with these guys on the best level. I really hope also that I win my maiden slam when they're still around because it just counts more.\"He spent an intense four hours on court in the quarterfinals against Nadal and endured an emotional rollercoaster against Alexander \"Sascha\" Zverev in the last four. Entering the final having played an average of one hour more than Djokovic might have contributed to the result, no matter if the Austrian is considered one of the fittest players on the tour. He gestured, too, that he felt like vomiting in his semifinal. \"I think I've rarely felt physically that tired, especially now after all the tension's gone,\" said Thiem. \"I played an unbelievable intense match against Rafa, such an intense match against Sascha in the semis. Today again I think almost over four hours. I think that was very demanding.\"Of course, I just feel a lot of emptiness right now.\"All three of Thiem's grand slam defeats have come at the hands of the all conquering Big Three. In Melbourne, no one in the men's game has been better than Djokovic.",

Nonstop for an hour, they're hit in all directions with different types of questions. It's loud. It's borderline chaotic.I spotted him talking to a TV reporter behind a rope near the stage, so I scrambled around the corner to see if I could talk to him. But by the time I got over there, about 10 other media members got there ahead of me and started asking questions.I was running out of time.

This is his first time experiencing the Super Bowl as a team executive.\"I never thought you could equal the feeling of going to the (Super Bowl) as a player, but this one's just as good,\" Lynch told NBC Sports Bay Area in the 49ers locker room after his team won the NFC title against the Green Bay Packers.Lynch retired from the game in 2008 but hasn't strayed very far from the game he's loved.Lynch celebrates with the George Halas Trophy after winning the NFC Championship game against the Green Bay Packers at Levi's Stadium on January 19 in Santa Clara, California.

But a foundation was being laid, and it sprang to life this season.Forty six of the 53 players on this year's roster were acquired in the three seasons Lynch and Shanahan have been at the helm, including stars like Jimmy Garoppolo, Richard Sherman and Nick Bosa.The 49ers ended with a 13-3 regular season, the top seed in the NFC playoffs and a dominant performance in the playoffs that saw them outscore their opponents (Minnesota and Green Bay) 64-30 on their way to a Super Bowl.Lynch arrives at Miami International Airport in Miami on Sunday.Lynch was named executive of the year by the Pro Football Writers of America, something his right-hand man Shanahan saw he could become from the moment they started working together.\"When you were as good a player as he was, when you're as smart as he is, when you have the passion he has ... I knew he'd be very good at being a general manager,\" Shanahan told the San Francisco Chronicle. \"I call him 'Captain America' because it's true in how he asks and stuff. He's like that all the time.\"\"Captain America\" could claim another massive honor this weekend in Miami. Lynch could be elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame when modern-era players are selected on Saturday. It's the seventh straight year Lynch has been a finalist for the Hall.

At 21, Kenin became the youngest women's champion at the Australian Open since her idol, Maria Sharapova, in 2008. \"I'm so proud of myself, my dad, my team, everyone that has been around me,\" said Kenin. \"We've worked all hard.

Read More\"I think she found very, very good shots during the match,\" said Muguruza, who was unseeded after being a former world No. 1. \"Especially in the important moments, I think she came out with winners and just hitting the ball very good.\"An increasingly erratic Muguruza was undone by eight double faults, three in the final game including one long on match point. Kenin put her hand to her face in disbelief in the moment of victory before exchanging a hug with Muguruza. Soon it was off to dad Alex in her box for a handshake. Mom Svetlana stayed at home, too nervous to watch the match.

That doesn't figure to be an issue any longer.She will move inside the top 10 from 15th in the rankings and replace Serena Williams as the new US No. 1. Kenin -- who ended home hopes by upsetting world No. 1 Ashleigh Barty in the semifinals -- said she'd like to move to New York one day, partly due to its fancy shops. She'll have more money to spend after pocketing $4 million AUD ($2 million). Like Sharapova, Kenin was born in Russia before settling in Florida at a young age via New York. Her dad drove a taxi and studied computers, despite not having a good grasp of English. They had little money. At times when driving the taxi, Alex said he couldn't understand where he was supposed to go. \"I don't think she experienced all the sacrifices we had to go through but she knows about them and when we just got to the country, that was like very, very, very tough,\" said Alex.Kenin started to play when she was around three and a half years old, hitting balls with her dad in their driveway in Pembroke Pines, Florida. Prominent tennis coach Rick Macci helped hone her game and it wasn't long before a six-year-old Kenin was being given a tour of the Miami Open by grand slam winner Kim Clijsters. As a child, she also had her picture taken with Anna Kournikova and enjoyed watching Andy Roddick. JUST WATCHEDWuhan coronavirus affecting sporting eventsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWuhan coronavirus affecting sporting events 01:03Kenin isn't the tallest at 5-foot-7 but generates ample power by straddling the baseline and using her opponents' pace. Furthermore, she matches Sharapova's fierce competitiveness. In the final two sets, Kenin delivered 19 winners with only eight unforced errors, also playing incredible defense when required. \"She proved she can compete at any level,\" said Alex. \"Those people who didn't believe in her, they had very valid reasons not to, because she's always been the smallest one, but I guess thank God I saw something they didn't because I know her better.\"Muguruza doesn't have the most power on the tour but there is ample venom that is, when on her game, relentless. Kenin was on the back foot for the opener, though didn't appear to be overawed in her first grand slam final. Melbourne's weather is living up to the script. After two days of scorching temperatures that topped 40 degrees Celsius, rain followed and the temperature dropped considerably by Saturday evening. Thankfully for all parties, the bush smoke that hit Melbourne during qualifying week after the bush fires in the country has not been an issue during the tournament proper. Early lead for MuguruzaKenin dropped serve at 1-1 with a forehand wide and Muguruza built a 4-2 advantage helped by winning a 23-shot rally that ended with a volley winner. Muguruza, who came into the Australian Open ranked 32nd, was broken for 4-4 after hitting back-to-back double faults for the second time in the contest -- a precursor to more serving woes in the third. Yet Muguruza didn't allow that blip to turn into an extended slide, breaking back for 5-4. She created nine break points in the first, which was sealed with a loud Muguruza roar. Losing the first set appeared to be trouble for Kenin, since one had to go back to 2013 for the last time a women's player rallied to win the final after dropping the opener -- Victoria Azarenka defeating Li Na. Kenin is more accustomed to roaring than Muguruza and three times she let out loud yells of \"come on\" including when earning a break point at 2-1. A Muguruza error led to the break. When she held for 4-1, Kenin purposefully walked to her chair in keeping with her quick strides between points. Her second-set numbers were glittering -- eight winners and only four unforced errors.Garbine Muguruza had started well and went a set up in the match.Just like in their lone meeting in Beijing last year, won by Kenin, the encounter went to a third. The trainer visited Muguruza as she felt the effects of a long fortnight but there was no medical timeout. Kenin saved all three of the break points at 2-2 by moving Muguruza around and registering three winners. It was bold tennis under extreme pressure. \"That's the game I feel like changed things,\" said Kenin. \"I had to play some (of my) best tennis. I did. After that, I was on fire. I was ready to take the beautiful trophy.\"Muguruza was having to work so hard for points, as evidenced by another 23-shot rally when Kenin's defensive lobs kept the point going. Muguruza subsequently dropped serve from 40-15 -- missing a backhand near the net at deuce after Kenin's return skimmed the tape and then double faulting on break point -- and Kenin didn't look back. This was still an encouraging tournament for Muguruza, who'd beaten Serena and Venus Williams in her two other major finals. Unseeded for the first time at a grand slam since 2014 after a troubling 2019, the 26-year-old defeated three top-10 seeds after being reunited with coach and Hall of Famer Conchita Martinez. Scaling Mount Kilimanjaro in the off-season appears to have been a life -- and career -- altering moment. \"I think I'm in a good process,\" she said. \"I think I felt my game much better than before.\"But Muguruza wasn't able to hit the heights Saturday thanks to an American whose determination matches her impressive game.",

The world's biggest show is clattering into Miami this weekend, as the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers battle to hoist the Vince Lombardi Trophy in the National Football League's 100th season.Super Bowl LIV is a finely poised contest on the field, but for casual fans and rookies around the world it's a David vs. Goliath battle to brush up on the sport's extensive history, rule book and terminology in time for the big game.No one wants to be the rookie at a Super Bowl party -- the person reading the label on the back of the nachos pack and asking which team is the one in red. But this guide is here to help. By the time you get to the end, you'll be an expert at identifying a Cover 1 scheme and will be able to perfectly recreate an offensive guard's three-point stance.Read MoreOn second thought, maybe we'll save that for next year. Here's a simple explainer of everything you really need to know.Giants quarterback Eli Manning lifts the Vince Lombardi Trophy after winning Super Bowl XLVI.Explain very slowly what a 'Superbowl' isWell, firstly, it's a Super Bowl -- two words. The Super Bowl is the last game of the NFL season; the final, as the rest of the world would call it, where the two last remaining teams out of a field of 32 go head-to-head. Only one will become world champions (which is like calling a British person a world champion of queuing, we know, but don't rain on their parade).  Oh, and don't -- under any circumstances -- call it the \"Super Bowl final.\" That's a surefire way to expose yourself as a football fraud.Why is it a bowl?  Americans like to do their own thing when it comes to sports, so football has \"bowls.\" The name comes from the Rose Bowl stadium in California, which hosted early college football finals. At that level these days, everything's a bowl: The college season has the Orange Bowl, the Citrus Bowl, the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl, the Cheez-It Bowl and something called The Bad Boy Mowers Gasparilla Bowl. But the Super Bowl is the only bowl in professional football (aside from the Pro Bowl, an all-star game which is essentially a glorified practice). As such, it is the most superb bowl of all, and it is not sponsored by potatoes.And this non-potato-affiliated bowl is a big deal, right?Yes. The Super Bowl is a de facto national holiday that takes over the United States, and just about every aspect of it is monetized, scrutinized and celebrated. Around 100 million people watched it in the States last year. That's nearly a third of the country.   Fireworks at Super Bowl XLIX in Arizona.But the Super Bowl is a \"thing\" around the world now, too, so wherever you are, you'll need to know how to talk about things like unnecessary roughness and squib kicks in the near future. Don't worry, though, you'll learn what those things are as you go.I'm sorry, squib kick? What are you talking about? Right, here's how the game works. Each team is actually made up of three teams -- their offense, their defense and their special teams -- and only one is on the field at one time. Team A's offense tries to move an egg-shaped ball up a field against Team B's defense, either by running with it or throwing it forward. The ultimate goal is to get into the other team's end zone for a touchdown (seven points, if they make a kick afterward), or kick it through their goalposts (three points). But the immediate aim is to progress 10 yards forward in four attempts. If they don't do that, the other team's offense takes over and drives the other way. If you lose the ball or throw it to the other team, they take over, too.Nick Foles throws a pass in Super Bowl LII.Luckily there'll be a yellow line on your TV, telling you how many yards from the line of scrimmage the team needs to move the ball, and how many tries they have remaining.Scrimmage is a silly word.It is, but it's important. That's where each individual play begins. And why does it keep stopping?This is the number one gripe of non-football fans. It's true, the game is split into a number of plays, rather than a continuous clock. But that means that anything can happen on any given play! A touchdown! An interception! A holding penalty! Besides, billions of people worldwide love cricket, which is literally five days where nothing happens and then it rains so everyone calls it a draw. You're telling me you can't dedicate three hours of your life to watch some of the most athletic humans on the planet in the biggest game of their lives?The football stuffWe're making great progress. But there's a few more things you need to know before you can blend in with your football-loving friends -- it's time to take a look at Sunday's big game.OK, I'm hyped! So who's playing in this year's Super Bowl?Oh boy -- we've got a doozy. Two marquee, historic teams have made it to the big game in the NFL's 100th season. This could be the most expensive Super Bowl everThe Kansas City Chiefs are playing in their first Super Bowl for FIFTY years, and they have one of the most exciting, creative offenses we've ever seen. Their coach, Andy Reid, has done just about everything in his career except win a Super Bowl, their fans are rowdy, and they regularly play in temperatures that turn football coaches' faces even redder than usual. On the other side are the San Francisco 49ers, who have five previous Super Bowl wins but haven't lifted the trophy for 25 years. They sucked last year, but drafted defensive end Nick Bosa -- a decision Donald Trump predicted would help \"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN\" after Bosa had shown support for the President -- and now they have a tough defense and a virtually unstoppable running game. Which ones are the Patriots?Neither. The New England Patriots are normally in the Super Bowl, you're right, but they didn't get anywhere near it this time around -- so we're treated to two fresh, interesting teams. That means Tom Brady, the attractive football robot man who plans to play until the age of 65, thanks entirely to a diet of avocado stones and milk, will not be at this year's shindig. But literally no one likes the Patriots except Patriots fans, and they only pay attention for three weeks a year, so America isn't too torn up about it.Where is the game? Super Bowl LIV is in Miami on Sunday, in the Dolphins' newly renovated Hard Rock Stadium. Florida got itself ready for the big game in the most Florida way possible -- by hosting something called the Python Bowl, a 10-day contest encouraging people to head out to into the Everglades and kill a lot of snakes.Florida gets into the Super Bowl spirit.The Fox broadcast will be shown around the English-speaking world. The game is being commentated on by Joe Buck; a man who calls every play, no matter its importance, like he's reading the terms and conditions of a home insurance policy -- so you may have to generate your own excitement.He'll be joined by former quarterback Troy Aikman. Along with CBS' Tony Romo, ex-Dallas players have something of a monopoly on NFL broadcast booths -- so since the 1990s the Cowboys have sportingly agreed to avoid reaching the Super Bowl for fear of creating a conflict of interest.Who's Liv? Is she one of the players?Not Liv, LIV -- the Super Bowl is an epic occurrence, like a war or a Shakespeare play about a king, so it gets to use Roman numerals. This is the 54th Super Bowl.Got it. So who are the II quarterbacks?The Chiefs' signal-caller (the guy who barks out orders to the other players) is perhaps the most talented quarterback of his generation: Patrick Mahomes. He flings footballs in ways that most of us can't even comprehend (see this no-look pass), and makes defenders look foolish on a regular basis. He's only in his third season in the league, but he's already a superstar. The 49ers, meanwhile, have Jimmy Garoppolo, owner of a superbly chiseled face, who could very well have been unpacked from a box labeled \"quarterback.\" But no one is quite sure whether he's actually a good quarterback or not. Luckily, his young, Good Will Hunting-style whiz kid coach Kyle Shanahan can draw up a plan to win any kind of game.Mahomes (left) and Garoppolo (right).Anyone else I should know about?The league's two best tight ends -- a hybrid position that lies somewhere between blocker and receiver -- are going to head to head; Travis Kelce and George Kittle are both monsters for their offense and are coming off impressive seasons. You may also have heard of Richard Sherman, the 49ers' cornerback, who has taken issue with just about every media personality in America at some point during his impressive career, and delivered one of the great sporting rants of all time after getting to his first Super Bowl in 2014. He's not a household name, but the Chiefs' game-wrecking defensive lineman Chris Jones could be pivotal to slowing down the Niners' ground game. If that happens, Kansas City speedster Tyreek Hill and shifty 49ers rookie Deebo Samuel will need to help out their quarterbacks in a shootout.The NFL says no to Super Bowl tailgating in Hard Rock Stadium parking lotsWho's going to win?The Chiefs are razor-thin favorites, but this is essentially a toss-up. A shootout is possible; both the Chiefs' video-game offense and the Niners' balanced, heavily schemed attack are extremely potent. But each side also has defenses coming into their own, and the game could turn on a single mistake or turnover.So who should I root for?If you like ridiculous action movies with lots of explosions and stunt scenes and Jason Statham, root for the Chiefs. If you like dramas with a balanced, thought-out plots and clever dialogue and Leonardo DiCaprio, root for the 49ers.If you're a city slicker, go Niners. If you're an everyman, go Chiefs. If you'd prefer a beach holiday, go Niners, but if you like to hit the ski slopes, go Chiefs. If you like red, support both teams, unless you also like gold -- in which case, support the 49ers.I'm bored with all this football talk. What else happens at the Super Bowl?The Super Bowl isn't just the climax of a sporting season; it's also the biggest stage of the year for performers, marketing teams, broadcasters and party hosts. So if you don't care about the game, you're in luck: every second of the four-hour package is tailored for you, the viewer, including pre-game, mid-game and full-time festivities.How can I sound smart at my Super Bowl party? The safest thing you can shout during a game is \"TACKLE HIM!\" since NFL fans tend to feel that screaming such a basic instruction a thousand miles away has an impact on the actual game.There are plenty of footballing cliches you can sprinkle about, too. Start by muttering \"That's gotta be a flag,\" or \"He's open!\" or \"Dude, this coverage is so soft,\" but make sure to do this during a play and not while the commercials are on.Then, when you're feeling confident, casually turn to the person next to you and say, \"You know, this wide nine scheme the 49ers are playing is leaving Mahomes way too much space to exploit underneath,\" take a sip of your beer, and bask in the newfound respect of your fellow football fans. JUST WATCHEDWatch the 2020 Super Bowl adsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWatch the 2020 Super Bowl ads 02:10People care about the commercials?Absolutely -- with the Super Bowl unrivaled in viewing figures, a 30-second spot costs upward of $5 million and the ads have become an event in their own right. Marketing teams go all out on these things, with every company wanting to have the ad everyone's talking about on Monday. It all leads to a hodgepodge of celebrity cameos, emotional montages about pick-up trucks, and cringeworthy attempts to go viral.Clint Eastwood growling to himself about America in a dimly lit tunnel? Sounds good. The guy from \"Gangnam Style\" singing his terrible song with a line of dancing pistachios, but replacing the line \"hey, sexy lady\" with \"hey, crack your nuts now?\" Why not? Oh, and dogs. Dogs in \"Star Wars\" costumes. Dogs hanging out with horses. Dog heads on the torso of a monkey and the legs of a baby: We've seen it all. The over-under on how many commercials will feature a dog this year, for what it's worth, is three and a half.What is this, the puppy bowl?Good one. You can binge most of the ads online before the game these days, but save some for the night.Who's doing the halftime show?Michael Jackson, Prince, Beyonc\u00e9 and the Rolling Stones have all helmed the big gig in its distinguished history -- but this year, the league has gone for not one but two of 2002's biggest names.Shakira and Jennifer Lopez are equal-billed headliners. Between them, the singers have a weighty catalog of hits -- from \"Let's Get Loud\" to \"Jenny from the Block\" to \"Hips Don't Lie,\" an anthem so epic it would be a fitting finale to any set.The halftime show isn't always a hit. The Black Eyed Peas screamed their way through a forgettable show in 2011, while Coldplay's set in 2016 was so boring Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruno Mars were parachuted in to save it. Then, last year, the NFL celebrated its host city Atlanta -- home to a historic and prestigious hip hop scene -- by giving the gig to Maroon 5.Shakira and J-Lo will be hoping to dazzle the Miami crowd.What about the national anthem?Demi Lovato is stepping up this year, and the line on how long she'll take over \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" is exactly two minutes.You can bet on that stuff?You can bet on everything, from what J-Lo will be wearing to whether MC Hammer will say \"Hammer Time\" in his Cheetos commercial. The national anthem and broadcast packages always offer up plenty of obscure side bets. What should I eat?Nachos. Wings. Pizza. Popcorn. Hot dogs. Corn dogs. An incredible amount of food is consumed on Super Bowl Sunday (you can eat healthily too, by the way). Americans work their way through 1.3 billion wings during the game, according to the National Chicken Council. If you put them all in a line, you'd have a really long line of wings.I think I'm ready. Put me in, coach!Good luck. Enjoy what should be a great game; this time next year, you'll be teaching your friends.Let's go, Patriots!I give up.",

        "content": "(CNN)During his illustrious career at the LA Lakers, Kobe Bryant conquered almost all in the NBA but the superstar was never just content with his own personal success.In his final interview with CNN Sport, Bryant used his global appeal to once again promote the women's game, stating that a number of Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) stars could one day compete with the men.  Just days after his interview was published, Bryant was killed in a helicopter crash that also took the lives of his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, and seven others. However, his words are cherished by Diana Taurasi, one of the women that Bryant referred to in his interview with CNN. Responding to his claims that she could one day make an appearance in the NBA, Taurasi laughed that she may be too old for such a feat. Read More\"It might have passed me by but I can still shoot the corner three and, I mean, who plays defense in the NBA anyway?\" she joked to CNN Sport's Don Riddell.Diana Taurasi is seen by many as the greatest WNBA star of all-time and Bryant believed she could succeed in the men's game too.'He never beat around the bush'The 37-year-old Taurasi is considered by some as the greatest WNBA player of all-time and has been the league's all-time leading scorer since June 2017.As a three-time WNBA champion with Phoenix Mercury, Taurasi earned the nickname \"White Mamba\" -- a derivative of Bryant's own \"Black Mamba\" monicker.\"I think the sad part is that the greatness was just starting,\" she said, describing the news of Bryant's death as a \"bad dream.\"\"When you saw him with his daughter and the things that he was doing with different projects. I knew Kobe pretty well and he was a guy that was always moving forward. That's all we can do now is move forward for him.\"Part of Bryant's passion and support for the WBNA stemmed from his daughter's love of the game and Gianna showing early promise at youth level.Taurasi, who has won a total of four Olympic gold medals for the USA, said it was \"surreal\" to hear Bryant praise her ability. \"He was just trying to think outside the box and give us that validation, you know, as women's sports and athletes, that we are looking for,\" she said. \"I think when he said it, he meant it. He never beat around the bush. What he really felt and wanted to say, he did and it was an honor.\" Kobe Bryant's daughter Gianna showed plenty of basketball promise.Gender equality Taurasi has been at the forefront of the effort to secure gender equality in basketball for many years and the campaign made a breakthrough recently that promises to see WNBA salaries increase. \"There is still a sense we need validation. We need people to invest. That was the one thing that is going to be sad because Kobe was on that track,\" she said.\"He put his time and his passion toward women's sports. I think, as of late, people are taking notice and really investing their time and money into it.\"Fellow WNBA star Sue Bird, who can also boast four Olympic gold medals, praised Bryant's influence on the sport. Like Taurasi, Bird says the superstar \"genuinely cared\" about women's basketball and was inspired by Bryant when they met at the Olympic Games. \"I mean that Mamba Mentality, it didn't stop on the basketball court. There were nights we played cards, just hanging out, and you could see it come out,\" she told CNN Sport. \"He had played this long career and we all knew him in this one role but he was just starting to live his life and starting to get into the things he was most curious about. That's just incredibly sad.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Just as the NBA was approaching the critical stage of an exhilarating season this month, it abruptly suspended play when Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz tested positive for the coronavirus only minutes before a scheduled tipoff.Since that dramatic scene unfolded on March 11, the NBA announced that a number of other players, including Kevin Durant of the Brooklyn Nets, have also tested positive, along with New York Knicks owner James Dolan and other members of the NBA community.Like England's Premier League, the NBA is one of the world's wealthiest sports associations affected by the coronavirus, and the disease's economic impact on it could be fierce. How the league will be affected by the stoppage -- and whether it can avoid financial calamity -- depends on a number of variables, according to those with knowledge of the sports entertainment industry. Rudy Gobert #27 of the Utah Jazz looks on before a game against the Toronto Raptors at Vivint Smart Home Arena on March 9, 2020 in Salt Lake City, Utah.READ: NBA star Gobert faces backlashRead MoreCan the NBA playoffs be saved? The NBA will do everything it can to preserve one of the most anticipated postseasons in recent memory. A potential ratings bonanza is on the cards for an inter-Los Angeles playoff series between the Lakers and Clippers. Meanwhile, the Milwaukee Bucks have been winning at a historic pace, and young stars like Luka Doncic and Ja Morant are still hoping to make their playoff debuts.Salvaging the playoffs would mean making good on its lucrative TV deal, a matter of urgency for the NBA, according to David Berri, professor of economics at Southern Utah University, who cites the reported $2.7 billion annual television package deal that accounts for about 30% of league revenues. (The rights fees are split between Disney, the parent company of broadcasters HBO and ESPN, and AT&T, the parent of WarnerMedia, which also owns CNN.) \"The anticipation is that they will finish the season,\" says Berri. \"At this point, ESPN and ABC have made virtually no money on their investment for this year, because they make (most of) their advertising money on the playoffs. The question is who eats that loss?\"No one yet knows when it will be safe for players, staff, officials, media and fans to congregate in an arena, but the NBA has targeted a best-case return date of mid-to-late June, according to ESPN.  That timeline is on pace with the resumption of the Chinese Basketball Association, which halted play in late January and has called back its American players for a planned start in late April or early May, according to ESPN.Kevin Durant (second from left) of the Brooklyn Nets is the most prominent NBA player to test positive for the coronavirus.READ: 'We all have Hoop Dreams': Bittersweet tale of first 'reality TV show'A mid-June NBA reboot would allow nearly 12 weeks to complete a truncated regular season followed by a full playoffs and finals, while avoiding a potential clash with the scheduled start of the NFL season on September 5 (which could also be in peril, according to Bleacher Report).The NBA did not respond to CNN's request for comment on the nature of its broadcast deals. However, based on what transpired during the strike-shortened 1998-1999 NBA season, the networks may still be liable for rights fees, according to the Wall Street Journal.Last week, research analyst Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson slashed earnings estimates for Disney, citing $475 million in lost ad sales if the NBA season is canceled entirely. \"I'm assuming the ad money will probably disappear,\" Nathanson says, noting that the league would then be expected to make concessions to the networks for the following season. \"Why would you pay for something and never get credit back?\" he asks.Zion Williamson #1 of the New Orleans Pelicans shoots over Jonas Valanciunas #17 of the Memphis Grizzlies during a NBA game at Smoothie King Center on January 31, 2020 in New Orleans, Louisiana.

The NBA is preparing estimates for team owners on the financial tolls they could face based on a few different scenarios, according to ESPN. They include scrapping the season altogether, resuming play in empty arenas and, in a best-case scenario, completing the playoffs with fans in seats. NBA commissioner Adam Silver confirmed he was exploring the idea of holding games with medically cleared NBA personnel and players -- but no fans.\"Presumably, if we had a group of players, and staff around them, and you could test them and follow some sort of protocol, doctors and health officials may say it's safe to play,\" he told ESPN.The NBA has already told teams to begin booking smaller arenas and practice facilities for dates leading into August, according to ESPN, to avoid television views of swaths of empty seats.Fans exit after the Sacramento King game against the New Orleans Pelicans was postponed due to the corona virus at on March 11 in Sacramento, California.READ: Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi donate to hospitals in fight against coronavirusGames with no spectators, would mean lost ticket sales of $300 million for the remaining 259 regular season games, and a further $166 million for approximately 83 playoff games, NBC Sports estimates.Adding in lost concessions and merchandising sales would account for up to $700 million in total game day losses, according to The Washington Post. However, made-for-TV games would not only preserve the league's relationship with its partnering networks, it would also secure game day advertising revenue for teams, including those on uniforms and billboards, says Eric Handler, media and entertainment analyst at MKM Partners.\"Sponsorship deals are dependent upon games being played and those logos being seen,\" he says. \"If you can't deliver the goods, you can't get paid.\"The NBA flagship retail store is seen on October 9, 2019 in Beijing, China. READ: Carmelo Anthony shares LeBron James storyWhat is the cost of losing the regular season?The NBA labor strike of 2011 forced the league to miss a similar portion of the current remainder of the season, plus the preseason, costing $400 million each for the teams and the players, according to the New York Times. League revenues have more than doubled since 2011, to $8.76 billion last season, according to data provider Statistica.Extrapolating those figures would mean losses of over $1.7 billion for the potential cancellation of just the final regular season games -- a scenario that would not be surprising given the uncertainty surrounding the health scare.Data forecaster FiveThirtyEight says the current suspension of the regular season could cost the NBA $1 billion, adding that a shortened or delayed playoffs would escalate to further losses. Dallas Mavericks star Luka Doncic.Will players be paid for the rest of the season? This could potentially be a sensitive topic for NBA owners. At least half of them, including Mark Cuban of the Dallas Mavericks and Jody Allen of the Portland Trail Blazers have committed to paying lost wages for arena staff and other personnel during the work stoppage, alongside a few star players like Zion Williamson and Giannis Antetokounmpo.Complicating matters for owners, not all of whom own their own arenas, is the potential for paying the likes of ticket handlers and popcorn venders again once the games are rescheduled. \"Do we pay them twice?' I personally don't care. That's fine,\" Cuban told the New York Times. I was tested 5 days ago and the results came back tonight, which were positive. Ive been self quarantined since the test, thank goodness. COVID-19 must be taken w the highest of seriousness.

Further damaging to players is the likelihood that next season's salary cap -- a factor of this season's dwindling league revenue -- will be lowered.Before the coronavirus disruption, the NBA had already lost \"hundreds of millions\" in revenue over a much-publicized preseason rift with China, Silver said last month. The current cap of $109 million per team may decrease by up to $15 million, according to a Bleacher Report estimate.  Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is one of the NBA owners committed to paying arena workers during the suspension of play. Will there be a lasting impact on fans? When paying customers are eventually cleared to return to arenas, how quickly will they feel safe enough to assimilate in groups of thousands after a global pandemic?  And would a potential glut of delayed live sporting events running at the same time hurt the NBA?\"People want live entertainment,\" says Nathanson. \"I'm still in the mind that, like after 9/11, people will return to their behaviors. People are still social creatures and sports is a bonding experience.\"Berri compares this situation to the suspension of professional baseball during World War II. Fan attendance spiked following the war in 1946, before it normalized over the ensuing decade, he says.\"Once people feel safe, you're going to see attendance of sporting events skyrocket,\" he says, adding the caveat of a likely looming recession coinciding with the resumption of play. \"It may not happen right away, because we're in a recession and people don't have money.\"Kawhi Leonard #2 of the LA Clipper and LeBron James #23 of the Los Angeles Lakers during the first half at Staples Center on March 08, 2020 in Los Angeles, California.Is there a silver lining around home quarantines?

        "content": "Rome (CNN)On Monday, the Vatican press office issued an official photo of Pope Francis and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte ahead of a private audience in which they discussed the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on the world, according to an Italian government spokesman.What was most telling about the photo wasn't the look of concern on the leaders' faces -- it was the fact that the men appeared to be standing closer to each other than the one meter (three feet) dictated by current social distancing norms in parts of Europe.Vatican City is the seat of the Catholic church, and it has been a sovereign state in the middle of Rome since 1929. It has 605 residents, all with a Vatican City passport and who are out of Italy's legal jurisdiction. And while Rome and the rest of Italy impose stringent social distancing rules, multiple reports inside Vatican City suggest that the Holy See is doing far less than the rest of Italy to stop the spread.Italy's coronavirus death toll passes 10,000. Many are asking why the fatality rate is so highSome residents of the city-state are being carefully protected -- Pope Francis, well into his 80s with a damaged lung from an infection in his 20s, has twice tested negative for the novel coronavirus. He is being distanced from anyone who might be carrying the virus, the Vatican press office says, and he takes his meals in his private quarters and uses hand sanitizer before and after meeting any guests. But precautions seem far more lax for church employees lower down the ranks. The Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith has told employees to come to the office to avoid documents, files and archives from leaving the office, one employee told the Associated Press last week. Other offices, like the Propaganda Fide, require their employees to come in twice a week for the same reason.Italian police officers stand guard at a closed St. Peter's Square in the Vatican.Read MoreA source who lives inside Vatican City provided CNN with photos of full parking lots and long lines of cars outside Vatican City's main Santa Anna gates, filled with workers waiting to come to work.The source told CNN that many of those entering Vatican City are there to shop at the private supermarket and pharmacy, making it difficult for its residents to shop for themselves. The source also sent photos of nuns who live in convents outside Vatican City queuing for the Vatican supermarket and pharmacy, despite confirmed outbreaks in two Roman convents. There are no thermal scanners and the stores do not require patrons to wear masks or gloves, though many do.In contrast, just outside the Vatican walls, the entire city of Rome has been on lockdown since March 10 and all non-essential work has been prohibited. Anyone defying the lockdown faces fines up to \u20ac3,000. Anyone traveling through the city of Rome to work inside Vatican City is required to carry a letter stating that their work is essential. When faith threatens public healthThe Vatican press office has confirmed that the Pope is still holding meetings and private audiences. Many of the Holy See's offices are still functioning inside the sovereign city state. But the lack of lockdown sends a curious message, especially considering the elderly priests who dominate the population inside the walls. Six cases have been confirmed in the Vatican so far. Though only a small number of cases have been diagnosed, Vatican City has among the highest per capita occurrence of the virus.The Vatican City resident also told CNN that Swiss Guards, who serve as the city-state's de facto military, were told they could not wear masks so that they would \"not instill fear\" in other residents.Swiss Guards stand at an entrance gate to the Vatican during Italy's lockdown.\"I watch the cars making a line outside Vatican City, waiting to pass security checks by the Swiss Guards before their drivers need to badge in at offices,\" the source writes. \"Or perhaps they're just popping in to pick up a few things from the supermarket or pharmacy. The normality is breathtaking. Breathtakingly stupid, as every person who enters by car or on foot, breathes dangerously close to the young Swiss Guards and then again when they pass the Vatican's second security point, the Gendarmes, none of whom are armed with gloves or even a face mask, let alone a thermal scanner.\" Both security forces live in communal barracks within the Vatican. \"The recent mass outbreaks in Roman convents should be a warning, but so far it has gone unheard,\" says the source. The Pope delivers his blessing from inside the Apostolic Library at the Vatican on March 15.The resident has complained to higher-ups that the lack of lockdown is putting both Pope Francis and Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI in peril because of his advanced age and potential vulnerability if he were to contract the novel coronavirus. For now, though, the source considers Benedict \"the safest person in the whole city\" -- with no visitors allowed in or out of his private residence.The source also says that while mass is prohibited outside the Vatican City walls, there are regular masses held for residents and employees inside St. Peter's Basilica, which is closed to the general public. Residents are also allowed to roam through the church and pray in the chapels. On Monday, Italy's La Stampa newspaper reported that the Vatican had ordered 700 Covid-19 test kits. The Vatican Press office has not confirmed the story.Last week Pope Francis stood alone in the middle of St. Peter's square to deliver an extraordinary Urbi et Orbi prayer to \"respond to the pandemic\" even though by all measures, he is not practicing what he preaches in his own back yard.",

A lawmaker admonished in public for dropping in on his father's 78th birthday.The coronavirus crisis has upended norms in almost every Western society, giving rise to ways of life that would have seemed unimaginably Orwellian just a month ago. But in the United Kingdom, there is a unique growing concern around draconian tactics and overreach by police forces since Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced lockdown measures on March 23.Police in the town of Warrington in northern England were criticized last weekend for issuing a citation to six people for a variety of apparently minor acts. One recipient was \"out for a drive due to boredom,\" the force said on Twitter Sunday, while a group of people from the same household were stopped by officers for \"going to the shops for non-essential items.\" Several other forces have publicized details of their own similarly eager responses; which include the conventional, like spot road checks on drivers, and the bizarre, like staining areas of natural beauty with black dye to deter visitors. Read MoreUK coronavirus outbreak shows early signs of slowing, expert says, but restrictions may last for six monthsMeanwhile, a trade body for convenience store workers said \"heavy-handed\" officers were telling shopkeepers they couldn't stock non-essential items like Easter eggs, lashing out at \"overzealous enforcement and a misreading of the rules.\"The approach has led figures from across the political spectrum to raise concerns, with some warning that British policing risks slipping into territory usually occupied by authoritarian regimes and dictatorships.\"This is what a police state is like,\" Jonathan Sumption, a former UK Supreme Court justice, told BBC Radio on Monday. \"It is a state in which a government can issue orders or express preferences with no legal authority, and the police will enforce ministers' wishes.\"Legislation speedily introduced last week allows officers to fine people gathering in groups of more than two or leaving their homes without a good reason, and the measures are less severe than in several other countries.But those increased powers have nonetheless created an awkward dynamic in a country where police do not carry arms, and where the friendly caricature of a \"bobby on the beat\" still resonates.The confusion is only heightened by the fact that Britain's lockdown is looser than those in countries such as Italy or Spain. People are permitted to leave their homes to shop for basic necessities, exercise, providing medical services, or going to work if it is absolutely vital.Futher uncertainty has arisen because the rules are being interpreted differently -- including by the UK government.  When he announced the restrictions, Johnson said that people would be permitted to leave their homes to take one form of exercise a day. That guidance is repeated on the government's website.Overnight 6 people have been summonsed for offences relating to the new corona virus legislation to protect the public:These included;Out for a drive due to boredom Returning from parties Multiple people from the same household going to the shops for non-essential items pic.twitter.com/FstjlfdEkD\u2014 Warrington Police (@PoliceWarr) March 29, 2020\n\nBut the regulations themselves do not specify a number or type of exercise, saying only that people are permitted to leave \"to take exercise either alone or with other members of their household.\"The Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps, told BBC Radio on Tuesday that people should not drive to a rural location to to take their dog for a walk -- but that's not banned in the regulations, either.It's led to an unclear situation in the United Kingdom where individual police forces are filling in the blanks -- and, in many cases, attracting criticism.Police urged to maintain public trustWidespread debate about police coronavirus tactics first emerged last week, when Derbyshire's force posted a video of drone footage showing unwitting people walking through the area's Peak District National Park. The clip highlighted a number of vehicles at a roadside stop, before featuring a couple walking their dog, and another man going for a walk by himself. Despite posts yesterday highlighting issues of people still visiting the #PeakDistrict despite government guidance, the message is still not getting through. @DerPolDroneUnit have been out at beauty spots across the county, and this footage was captured at #CurbarEdge last night. pic.twitter.com/soxWvMl0ls\u2014 Derbyshire Police (@DerbysPolice) March 26, 2020\n\nIt did not appear obvious that either party was flouting the government's guidelines on outdoor exercise.  But the guidelines also warn against traveling, leading Derbyshire Police's video to label the trips \"not essential,\" sparking a backlash online.\"We understand that people will have differing views about this post, however, we will not be apologetic for using any legal and appropriate methods to keep people safe,\" the force responded on Twitter.Since then, numerous examples of strict crackdowns have been highlighted -- usually by police forces themselves, which have publicized their methods on social media, including spot checks on road users.In North Yorkshire, police published a photo showing a group of officers stopping a car. \"This driver was making an essential journey, unfortunately others are not,\" they wrote.And in Buxton, police took the unusual approach of dying a popular blue limestone quarry black to deter visitors.Sensing the mounting concern over officers' approach, one of the UK's most senior police officers urged colleagues on Monday to maintain \"the trust and confidence of the public.\"What you need to know about coronavirusSymptoms: When to seek helpMap: Covid-19's spread across the USKeeping clean: You can use these disinfectantsCalculator: How much will I get from the stimulus bill?\"How we police this pandemic will be remembered for many years to come,\" assistant commissioner Neil Basu wrote in an opinion piece in The Telegraph newspaper. Criticism of police methods has been far from universal, and those ignoring social distancing rules by gathering in parks or holding parties have equally been the targets of public anger. Shapps, the Transport Secretary, told Sky News on Tuesday that \"the police are doing a difficult job and they are doing it well,\" though he added: \"I am sure there are individual examples where perhaps you look at it and think that is perhaps a bit further than they should have gone.\"And in defense of her London officers, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said on radio station LBC on Monday that her workforce was \"adopting a very collaborative approach with the public.\" \"I would also ask all citizens, where they feel it safe and appropriate, to encourage members of their family and people they know to learn about the restrictions and to comply with them,\" Dick added, a recommendation that does little to dispel confusion about the restrictions themselves.Calls for clarityMedia reports on Tuesday suggested that the UK's National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) was issuing new guidelines to forces in the wake of mounting complaints, although a spokesperson for the NPCC disputed those suggestions in an email to CNN.\"We are not rewriting our guidance. It remains the same as it was. Engage, explain, encourage and finally enforce,\" the spokesperson said. \"This is a fast changing situation and we, along with the public, are adapting as we go forward.\"Police officers from North Yorkshire Police stop motorists on Monday to check that their travel is essential.Nonetheless, some legal experts have pointed to widespread confusion and an overly harsh interpretation of the government's lockdown measures as the cause of alleged overreach.\"Some police think that their job is to enforce the government's guidance, when in fact their job is to enforce the law,\" Raphael Hogarth, an associate at the Institute for Government think tank, said on Twitter. \"The law is that you may not leave home without a reasonable excuse. The legislation gives non-exhaustive examples of such excuses.\"\"Some police forces seem to be using their powers without any regard to the purpose for which these powers were conferred,\" he added. \"The purpose of the legislation is to stop the virus spreading, by stopping unnecessary inter-household contact.\"How can Boris Johnson run the UK while suffering from coronavirus?Indeed, confusion about what is and is not enforceable in the government's hastily-prepared lockdown legislation has been apparent even among lawmakers. Labour MP Stephen Kinnock fell foul of his local police force after posting a picture showing him celebrating the birthday of his father -- the now-retired former leader of the opposition Labour Party, Neil Kinnock.\"We know celebrating your Dad's birthday is a lovely thing to do, however this is not essential travel,\" South Wales police told him over Twitter. Although Kinnock was sitting a sizable distance from his parents, the government's restrictions specify that people should not visit relatives unless it is essential.\"We need to be really careful here,\" Liberal Democrat lawmaker Layla Moran said on Twitter, responding to complaints that convenience stores were being told they could not stock \"non-essential\" Easter eggs. \"Making a trip only for an Easter egg is clearly against the rules. But picking one up with the bigger shop for the kids? The Government needs to give sharper guidance for (local authorities) and Police on the application of the new laws,\" she added.",

        "content": "(CNN)Hungary's parliament has voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orban to rule by decree indefinitely, in order to combat the coronavirus pandemic, giving the populist leader extra powers to unilaterally enact a series of sweeping measures. The bill, which has been criticized by international human rights watchdogs, has no specified end date and allows Orban to bypass a number of democratic institutions in his response to the outbreak.It was approved in parliament on Monday, with 138 votes in favor and 53 against. The bill required a two-thirds majority to pass.Its provisions go well beyond the various forms of legislation hastily put together by other European Union member states in response to the coronavirus pandemic, dramatically ramping up the strongman leader's powers.The EU shuts its borders to slow the coronavirus crisisThe suspension of parliament, punishments for journalists if the government believes their coronavirus reporting is not accurate, and heavier penalties for violating quarantine regulations are all made possible by the order. No elections or referendums can be held while it is in place.Read MoreOrban said on Hungarian national Kossuth radio last week: \"We cannot react quickly if there are debates and lengthy legislative and lawmaking procedures. And in times of crisis and epidemic, the ability to respond rapidly can save lives. \"The Government is not asking for anything extraordinary,\" he added. \"It is asking for the ability to rapidly enact certain measures. We don't want to enact measures that the Government has no general right to enact -- we simply want to do so swiftly.\"But the bill has alarmed several international groups. Amnesty International warned it gives Orban's government \"carte blanche to restrict human rights.\"\"This is not the way to address the very real crisis that has been caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,\" David Vig, Amnesty International's Hungary Director, said in a statement. \"We need strong safeguards to ensure that any measures to restrict human rights adopted under the state of emergency are strictly necessary and proportional in order to protect public health.\"The order's draconian punishment of up to five years imprisonment for disseminating \"fake news\" relating to the pandemic has prompted particular concern from observers.What you need to know about coronavirusSymptoms: When to seek helpMap: Covid-19's spread across the USKeeping clean: You can use these disinfectantsCalculator: How much will I get from the stimulus bill?It states that \"a person who, during the period of a special legal order and in front of a large audience, states or disseminates any untrue fact or any misrepresented true fact that is capable of hindering or preventing the efficiency of protection is guilty of a felony and shall be punished by imprisonment for one to five years.\"Orban had already been on a collision course with the European Union over his country's hardline immigration policies and for clamping down on democratic institutions -- including civic organizations, the media and academic institutions -- as he consolidated his power.The new order is likely to lead to another confrontation with the bloc, with several European politicians -- including former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi -- calling for a robust response.\"I have been dreaming of a 'United States of Europe' for years. Precisely for this reason, I have the right, and the duty, to say that after what Orban has done today, the European Union MUST act and make him change his mind. Or, simply expel Hungary from the Union,\" Renzi wrote on Twitter.",

It was to instruct her fellow passenger to sit in the back of the car and to check that both were wearing face masks.\"We were told we cannot both sit in the front,\" said the CNN journalist, who was on her way to hospital with her partner to visit a sick relative.Related stories Why is Italy's fatality rate so high, after 10,000 deaths?Italian doctors hope for a sign the coronavirus lockdown is working, because there's no plan BCristiano Ronaldo drops entire salary as Juventus squad gives up $100M in wages'Like a bomb had gone off on either side of their chest.' London doctors speak of 'continuous tsunami'\"We have a special certificate giving us permission to go to the hospital,\" she said, adding that the relative does not have coronavirus. Such are the tight restrictions on Italians now living in the deadliest hotspot of the global coronavirus pandemic. Italy's death toll is now the highest in the world at 10,023. Fatalities passed the grim milestone on Saturday, with an increase of 889 since the last figures were released on Friday, according to Italy's Civil Protection Agency.Read MoreWith 92,472 confirmed cases, Italy appears to have the highest death rate on the planet. Compare it to China, the epicenter of the pandemic, which has a roughly similar number of confirmed cases at 81,997, but under a third as many deaths, at 3,299, according to Johns Hopkins University and Medicine.Indeed Italy now has the second-highest number of confirmed cases in the world after the United States, which stands at 105,470. But the US has a fraction of the deaths, at just over 1,700.As Italy enters its sixth week of restrictions, many are asking: why does its death rate seem so much higher than other countries?Experts say it's down to a combination of factors, like the country's large elderly population which is more susceptible to the virus, and the method of testing that's not giving the full picture about infections.Distorted numbersItaly's number of confirmed cases is \"not representative of the entire infected population,\" said Dr. Massimo Galli, head of the infectious disease unit at Sacco Hospital in Milan. The real figure was \"much much more.\"Only the most severe cases are being tested, added Galli, and not the entire population -- which in turn, skews the death rate.In the northern Lombardy region, which has the majority of cases, about 5,000 swabs are being carried out daily, said Galli. He added this was \"much lower than needed, with \"thousands of people waiting for diagnosis at their home.\"Italy records highest daily jump in coronavirus deathsA major obstacle for health workers carrying out tests, was limited protective gear available, he said.In a stark warning to other countries, Galli said: \"We have a national healthcare system that works very well, especially in Lombardy -- but even our system has been hit by this.\"Miracles have been done in multiplying the numbers of beds in hospitals,\" said the health expert. But medicine \"has been lacking -- and this is a big problem that will be felt by other countries.\"Elderly at riskAnother factor in the seemingly high death rate is Italy's elderly population, which is the largest in the world behind Japan. The average age of Italian patients who have died after testing positive for the virus was 78, the country's Health Institute said Friday.Galli said that until now, Italy's public healthcare system was able to keep a lot of elderly people with pre-existing medical conditions alive.But these patients were in \"a really fragile situation that can be broken by a virus like coronavirus,\" he added.Still, there have been some stories of hope. Like 102-year-old Italica Grondona, who recovered from coronavirus in the northern city of Genoa after spending more than 20 days in hospital, doctors who treated the woman and her nephew told CNN.Italica Grondona, 102, is recovering from coronavirus.'We nicknamed her Highlander -- the immortal,\" said doctor Vera Sicbaldi. \"Italica represents a hope for all the elderly facing this pandemic.\" Severity of sanctionsMeanwhile, some experts have questioned whether Italy's restrictions have gone far enough in halting the virus spread.China's Wuhan city was the first to impose a sweeping lockdown on its 11 million citizens back in January, with all flights, trains and buses canceled and highway entrances blocked. Now, more than two months later, officials in the pandemic epicenter are looking to ease those restrictions as new cases dry up. Italy meanwhile, is steadily ramping things up.

        "content": "(CNN)While most countries around the world have taken extraordinary and unprecedented measures to help stop the spread of coronavirus, Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko has been adopting a more relaxed response to the pandemic.According to WHO statistics, Belarus, a country with a population of 9.5 million, has recorded 94 cases of coronavirus and zero deaths.Lukashenko has repeatedly played down the severity of the Covid-19 pandemic, insisting that fears about the pandemic are \"psychosis\" and he has been publicly dismissive of international efforts to contain coronavirus.However, the Russian government has stepped up its response and on Monday temporarily closed its borders, with the newest directive applying to checkpoints on the border with Belarus. On Saturday, after playing ice hockey in front of a packed stadium in the country's capital, Minsk, Lukashenko said the \"fridge\" like area was a 'real anti-viral cure.\" There is no scientific evidence that coronavirus can be killed from refrigeration.Read MoreBelarusian President Alexander Lukashenko plays in an ice hockey match with Russian President Vladimir Putin in February.READ: Football is shut down across Europe due to the coronavirus, but in Belarus it's business as usualREAD: Cristiano Ronaldo and Juventus squad give up $100 million in wages amid coronavirus outbreak\"It's better to die standing than to live on your knees,\" Lukashenko told state-owned TV station All-National TV. When asked by the reporter if the pandemic would stop him from playing ice hockey, he replied: \"To stop me? But why? It is possible but why? I don't understand. There are no viruses here. Did you see any of them flying around? I don't see them too. \"This is a fridge. It is the best for health. This is better than sport and this fridge is the real anti-viral cure!\"Neither Lukashenko nor the supporters in the stands appeared to make any attempt to adhere to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for social distancing, embracing and patting each other on the back.While much of Europe remains in lockdown, Belarus is yet to implement restrictions on mass gatherings.The country's football league is also continuing as normal, with more than 1,700 fans attending the derby between two of Minsk's clubs on Saturday.",

London doctors speak of 'continuous tsunami'Bonini is one of thousands of Italian graduates taking up the government's call for urgent help tackling the deadliest outbreak of the virus in the world.The European country hit the grim milestone over the weekend of 10,000 deaths, accounting for roughly a third of the 30,000-plus deaths worldwide.With hospitals under extraordinary strain, Italy has expedited the procedure for medical school graduates entering the workforce -- cutting the hospital exam and increasing the number of doctors being recruited.Read MoreItaly's coronavirus death toll passes 10,000. Many are asking why the fatality rate is so highFor many graduates, it will be their first professional job in an industry facing its biggest crisis in a generation. It comes amid the deaths of 50 doctors, according to Italy's national federation of doctors.The abrupt changes to the procedures for fresh graduates entering the workforce, marks a major shakeup of Italy's education system, said Dr. Alessandro Grimaldi, Director of Infectious Disease at S.S. Salvatore Hospital of L'Aquila.Currently, students are required to do a residency, where they specialize in a certain area of medicine. But according to Grimaldi, there are between 3,000 and 4,000 fewer residency placements available than the number of students, meaning many travel abroad to work.Grimaldi likened the money spent on educating Italian medical students who then work overseas, to: \"giving a present of a Ferrari to countries abroad every year.\"These graduates \"would have been such great resources -- especially today,\" he added.So as the country enters its sixth week of lockdown, young Italian doctors are being catapulted to the health emergency's forefront.CNN spoke to some of them.'I'm scared to pass on this illness'Chiara Bonini, 26, Bergamo Bonini was studying for her final medical exams at the University of L'Aquila in central Italy, when the government put the call out for medical students to help out in the north.She was all set to go to work in her hometown of Bergamo -- until she contracted the virus, she believes from her boyfriend who is also a doctor. Now fully recovered, Bonini is awaiting clearance to go out and work. Having already contracted coronavirus, Bonini says she feels less afraid about her new job.\"My immune system has already fought this,\" she said. \"So if I were to be infected again, my body would recognize it in some way. \"The only fear I have of getting it again, is if I pass it on,\" Bonini added. \"I'm scared to pass on this illness.\" 'Arrogant to think this was only a Chinese issue'Samin Sedghi Zadeh, 29, CremonaZadeh has been working at a hospital in the hard-hit northern city of Cremona for the last two weeks. He left his comfortable job as a general practitioner in the private sector, after the government sought urgent help from medical professionals. \"A year ago when I graduated, I made a promise to make myself useful in the face of crisis,\" he said. \"Being closed-off in the comfort of an office is not helping this national emergency.\"Zadeh's family is originally from Iran, where his 80-year-old grandmother is weathering the outbreak there alone.He says Iran's response to the emergency has been weaker than Italy's, but countries in the West should also have been better prepared. \"We have all been very arrogant to think this was only a Chinese issue,\" said Zadeh. \"We in the West didn't think this was our issue,\" he said, adding, \"Instead we are about to be at full capacity in our field hospitals.\"Zadeh said that although Italy has one of the best health care systems in the world, he hopes it will also learn some lessons from the crisis.\"Sometimes when things go back to normal, memory is short,\" he said. \"As a young Italian, I hope there is more investment in the health care system for students.\"'I invested my entire life to do this work'Stefania Pini, 40, Cremona Pini graduated from the University of Parma, also in northern Italy, last year. But she was forced to move to neighboring Switzerland for work, after failing to secure a residency in Italy.Like many recent graduates, she jumped at the chance to help her country as it grapples with the pandemic.The 40-year-old said she started her degree later in life and \"took my time to do it well.\" Medicine was her life's calling, added Pini.\"I invested my entire life to do this work,\" she said. \"I didn't get married, I lived to study.\"Pini is now working at a hospital in her hometown and in Cremona.The position is temporary but she hopes in the future it might lead to full-time employment in her own country.\"I'm Italian and I would love to work in Italy,\" she said.CNN's Valentina Di Donato reported from Rome, Sheena McKenzie wrote in London",

        "content": "London (CNN)The UK could remain under coronavirus emergency measures for as long as six months, a top health official has said, even as one expert said there were early signs that the outbreak was slowing in Britain. Curbs on normal life may need to continue through the summer and into the autumn in order to avoid progress being \"wasted,\" England's Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries said on Sunday.Harries suggested that while lockdown rules imposed last week could be relaxed once the curve of cases begins to flatten, strict social distancing guidelines will likely remain in place. But a prominent epidemiologist sounded a note of cautious optimism on Monday, suggesting that there were some early signs that the lockdown measures were working. Neil Ferguson, a professor of mathematical biology at Imperial College London whose modeling has influenced UK government policy, told BBC Radio on Monday that he believes \"the epidemic is just about slowing in the UK right now.\" Read MoreHow can Boris Johnson run the UK while suffering from coronavirus?He pointed to a slight slowdown in the rate of increase in hospital admissions as evidence. \"It is the result of the actions people have taken and governments have taken,\" Ferguson said, adding that admissions had not yet plateaued and that the trend is not yet reflected in daily death tolls.\"We're critically missing direct data in the number of infections,\" he added. The UK has tested just under 130,000 people but the true number of people who have contracted Covid-19 is believed to be far higher.\"We think maybe a third, maybe even 40% of people don't get any symptoms,\" Ferguson said, predicting that around 2 to 3% of people in the UK may have been infected. Restrictions on social interactions and a partial economic shutdown were imposed last week to combat the spread of the virus in the UK. Shops, pubs, restaurants and businesses were closed and Prime Minister Boris Johnson banned almost all social events and public gatherings.Ferguson added that the development of a key antibody test will be \"critical\" to getting more accurate date on the extent of the outbreak.Those tests are \"in the final stages of validation right now,\" Ferguson said, suggesting they could be available in \"days rather than weeks.\" They would detect whether someone has previously had the Covid-19 virus -- a development Johnson previously called a \"gamechanger\" -- and the UK has ordered millions.But Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, warned against lifting restrictions too early. \"If we are successful we will have squashed the top of that curve, which is brilliant, but we must not then suddenly revert to our normal way of living,\" Harries said during the government's daily coronavirus briefing on Sunday. \"That would be quite dangerous. If we stop then, all of our efforts then all of our efforts would be wasted and we could potentially see a second peak.\"Medical staff wheel a model of a fake patient into the ExCeL London exhibition centre, which has been converted into field a massive hospital to help the UK's coronavirus response. Harries said a review would take place after three weeks of the measures, but predicted authorities would need \"two or three months to see whether we have really squashed it, but about three to six months ideally.\"Johnson wrote in a letter to be delivered to millions of British homes that \"things will get worse before they get better.\"And Harries agreed with the warning, adding: \"We actually anticipate that our numbers will get worse over the next week, possibly two, and then we are looking to see whether we have managed to push that curve and we start to see a decline,\" she said.The country has recorded 1,228 deaths from the virus so far, and Johnson has repeatedly warned that its heath service, the NHS, is at risk of collapsing if people do not follow the rules to stay at home. Top adviser self-isolatesAs the UK's outbreak grows, there are mounting concerns about the spread of Covid-19 at the top echelons of the UK government. Dominic Cummings, a top adviser to Johnson, is self-isolating after developing Covid-19 symptoms, a government spokesperson said n Monday.Related storiesLive: Cases top 723,000 globallyYoung Italian doctors fast-tracked to the frontlineWimbledon will be canceled, German official saysUS extends social distancing until April 30Johnson and his health minister, Matt Hancock, are also both in self-quarantine after testing positive for Covid-19 last week. England's Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty said Friday he is following the same protocol after developing symptoms, though he had not been tested.None of the three officials were present at Sunday's daily briefing, at which Harries delivered her stark warning about the length of the restrictions. Harries added that a lengthy extension of emergency measures would not necessarily mean the UK \"would be in complete lockdown for six months ... it means that as a nation we have to be really really responsible and keep doing what we're doing until we're sure that we can gradually start lifting various interventions.\"Even an extension of social distancing rules, however, would force Britons to remain in their homes throughout the summer months and mean major sporting events such as the Premier League would either need to be postponed further or continue without spectators.

So the two took to Instagram Live to talk about everything from their mutual love for wine to their favorite memories of the late Kobe Bryant. But around 30 minutes into the conversation, actress Gabrielle Union, Wade's wife, chimed in and asked Anthony to tell the story of when they were in the Bahamas and \"it didn't look like you were going to make it.\" \"That s--- got me sweating thinking about that,\" Anthony said before diving into the story. Anthony said the group of friends jumped off a boat and swam to a \"little grotto\" in the water. While everyone swam back up to the boat, Anthony said he stayed back to \"see the last bit of the barracudas snorkeling and all that.\" Read More\"Then I look up and the current is taking me in the middle of the ocean opposite from the boat,\" Anthony said, while admitting that \"it was my fault.\" Wade said the rest of the group couldn't see him and Anthony added that it was windy. \"All types of s--- was going on through my head,\" Anthony said. \"Then I look up at the boat, and I see 'Bron jumps off the boat like he's MacGyver. He jumps off the boat into the water. He was bringing me back with one arm.

        "content": "Moscow (CNN)Russia under President Vladimir Putin has pioneered authoritarian tech: Last year, the Kremlin leader approved measures that would enable the creation of a \"sovereign\" Russian internet, able to be firewalled from the rest of the world.The Covid-19 pandemic is now giving Russian authorities an opportunity to test new powers and technology, and the country's privacy and free-speech advocates worry the government is building sweeping new surveillance capabilities.Related storiesKremlin sends mixed messages as cases spiralMoscow imposes 'unprecedented' shutdownTrack the spread of the coronavirusLive updates on the coronavirusPerhaps the most well-publicized tech tool in Russia's arsenal for fighting coronavirus is Moscow's massive facial-recognition system. Rolled out earlier this year, the surveillance system had originally prompted an unusual public backlash, with privacy advocates filing lawsuits over unlawful surveillance.Coronavirus, however, has given an unexpected public-relations boost to the system.Last week, Moscow police claimed to have caught and fined 200 people who violated quarantine and self-isolation using facial recognition and a 170,000-camera system. According to a Russian media report some of the alleged violators who were fined had been outside for less than half a minute before they were picked up by a camera.Read More\"We want there to be even more cameras so that that there is no dark corner or side street left,\" Oleg Baranov, Moscow's police chief, said in a recent briefing, adding that the service is currently working to install an additional 9,000 cameras.  In this photo taken on  Feb. 22, a surveillance camera, top left, is seen as people walk down in a Moscow's Metro. The system has also been used to analyze the social networks of those who have or are suspected of having coronavirus. Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin described in his official blog how municipal authorities tracked a Chinese woman who flew to the city from Beijing back in February. While a test eventually came back negative, Sobyanin said the authorities located the taxi driver who took the woman home from the airport, a friend she met outside her apartment block in violation of the quarantine, and collected data on all 600 people living in her building. And then there's the use of geolocation to track coronavirus carriers. Epidemiologists see tracking and data-crunching as one important tool for tracking and localizing outbreaks, but Russia has taken a distinctive approach. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin earlier this week ordered Russia's Ministry of Communications to roll out a tracking system based on \"the geolocation data from the mobile providers for a specific person\" by the end of this week.In other words, the data hoovered up by the system will not be anonymous: According to a description in the government decree, information gathered under the tracking system will be used to send texts to those who have come into contact with a coronavirus carrier, and to notify regional authorities so they can put individuals into quarantine.Such measures have prompted little public debate. And Russia is far from being the only country in the world that increased surveillance capabilities to curb the spread of the virus. A video surveillance camera is pictured at the Novomoskovsky multipurpose medical center for patients suspected of the coronavirus infection symptoms, in Moscow.In Israel, the Shin Bet security service has shifted its powerful surveillance program to retrace the movements of coronavirus patients or suspected carriers. The mechanism is similar to that used in Russia -- phone and credit card data are used for mapping, and health officials must then alert and quarantine people who were within 2 meters, for 10 minutes or more, of someone infected with the virus, according to the country's Health Ministry. The ministry said in a statement the information will only be used by its specialists and deleted after 60 days. But rights groups have filed a petition against it to the High Court of Justice, which warned it will shut the program down unless more oversight is in place. On Thursday, Shin Bet said in a statement that it helped the health authorities to identify and isolate more than 500 residents who were found to be sick with the coronavirus.In South Korea, the government used data from credit card transactions, phone geolocation and surveillance footage to give detailed information on coronavirus patients, without identifying them by name, according to a government website. The result was a map where people can see if they were in close proximity to a coronavirus carrier. Detailed histories led to some patients being doxxed -- having their personal information outed without consent -- and authorities decided to scale down the data-sharing policies.Mobile carriers in the European Union are sharing data with health authorities in Italy, Germany and Austria to help monitor how people comply with social distancing, Reuters reported. The US government is looking into using anonymous data gleaned by tech giants for similar purposes, according to The Washington Post. But in Russia, privacy advocates worry that the country's use of facial recognition had already been a legal gray zone; stricter measures amid coronavirus could allow the state to exert even more control over its citizens once the epidemic is over.Why does Russia, population 146 million, have fewer coronavirus cases than Luxembourg?\"The difference lies with the countries that have a higher culture of privacy and a significant limitation of access and use of this data,\" said Sarkis Darbinyan, a lawyer with Roskomsvoboda, a non-government organization that tracks online freedoms in Russia. \"The scariest thing is that the epidemic will end someday, but these measures I'm sure will stay.\"Meanwhile, Russia plans to expand its existing systems as the number of coronavirus cases grows. But Moscow's system of Big Brother surveillance is far from perfect. Outside Russia's capital, facial recognition is usually limited to airports and railway stations, but the government says it is preparing to tap into other surveillance tools in an effort to further map out the virus patterns.",

        "content": "Madrid, Spain (CNN)Ernesto Ruiz Lopez, a pharmacist in Madrid, says he's never seen anything like this. He can't get protective masks, gloves or hand sanitizer from his regular suppliers, because they won't pay the sky-high prices, increasing at every stage of the chain, to obtain them. And he's wary of the intermediary sellers he calls \"absolute pirates\" trying to profit from shortages during the global coronavirus pandemic.Spain is one of the worst-affected countries in the world, with more than 5,000 deaths attributed to coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins University. Severe limits on people's movements here have been extended for a further two weeks and the authorities are trying to source sufficient protective equipment for a health service that is already very stretched.Ernesto Ruiz Lopez stands behind protective screen at counter of his Madrid pharmacy.Ruiz Lopez, right, and his employees wear masks and gloves and limit the number of customers allowed in at a time.Ruiz Lopez, who has owned a pharmacy near the Spanish capital's Retiro Park for eight years, says his distributors won't pay skyrocketing prices for these vital products. Masks are now fetching three or four times their normal price, while gloves are going for about double their usual value, he says. Other suppliers who have them in stock have abruptly raised prices, such as a 20% jump for hand sanitizer -- and demand payment in advance.\"In the end, you would pay twice as much for something you know is worth half of that and you take the risk of not knowing what you'll actually get,\" Ruiz Lopez told CNN.But nor can he afford to work unprotected. Ruiz Lopez and his five employees wear masks and gloves and limit the number of customers in the pharmacy to just two, one at each counter, while the others wait outside, some wearing masks and gloves themselves. Read MoreRelated storiesHouse passes $2 trillion stimulus billAir pollution drops in EuropeTrack the spread of the coronavirusLive updates on the coronavirusIn recent days, Ruiz Lopez says, some of the prices have moderated, which he thinks may be due to the police crackdown on companies and individuals exploiting these products. Police have publicized seizures with videos on their social media accounts, which has prompted some distributors to move their goods more quickly, the pharmacist says.Like many countries, Spain is trying to physically combat smuggling and illegal sales of masks and gloves to combat coronavirus, or Covid-19, as well as limit the damage done by websites claiming to sell drugs that can treat the virus.Last week, Spain's Civil Guard [the country's national military police] announced it had seized around 69,000 masks and more than 5,000 goggles and gloves at airports and ports of entry. Some of the equipment was due to be auctioned online. Around 7,000 masks had been imported from Ecuador were impounded in Gij\u00f3n, northern Spain, while a further 11,000 masks were impounded at an airport in the Canary Islands. The most significant seizures, however, have taken place in Madrid, where around 44,000 masks have been recovered. The Madrid pharmacist can't obtain protective equipment from his regular suppliers and is wary of sellers offering products at inflated prices.There's also the issue of shoddy or counterfeit products that pose a serious risk to potential patients, and these are battles being fought across Europe. Italy's financial police has also begun checks to identify commercial fraud and fraudulent price gouging. On Friday they announced a raid in the town of Piana, where 900 kits for the diagnosis of coronavirus were seized. The kits lacked national or European certification and were being offered, illegally, for sale online.On Thursday, the Spanish Agency for Medication and Health Products released a warning about treating the coronavirus with counterfeit drugs bought from illegal websites. The statement said that counterfeit drugs can pose a serious health risk, as they may contain undeclared active ingredients at different doses, or include harmful substances that could worsen disease.The agency reminded people \"that there is currently no specific authorized treatment for Covid-19,\" adding that medication for symptoms of the virus, such as fever, should also be checked with a doctor or pharmacist, and patients should only buy medicines from authorized pharmacy websites.The European Medicines Agency published similar advice earlier in the week, warning that \"vendors may claim that their products can treat or prevent Covid-19 or may appear to provide easy access to legitimate medicines that are otherwise not readily available. Such products are likely to be falsified medicines.\"The number of global coronavirus cases has now topped 600,000, with more than 27,000 deaths. At his Madrid pharmacy, Ruiz Lopez is disappointed by these attempts to exploit a horrific global situation. \"It's a shame that supply and demand has taken a dominant position over health criteria. That's the sad and regrettable part.\"CNN's Ingrid Formanek in Spain and Valentina Di Donato in Rome contributed to this report.",

        "content": "London (CNN)When British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Friday morning that he had tested positive for coronavirus, he insisted that he would continue to head up his country's fight against the pandemic.In a video posted to his official Twitter page, Johnson said that \"thanks to the wizardry of modern technology,\" he would continue to lead the effort remotely from the prime ministerial quarters above 11 Downing Street, next door to one of the most famous addresses on earth.But how can the leader of a country with a population of over 66 million carry on as normal while self-isolating during a global health crisis? Especially as his health secretary also tested positive for the virus, and that his chief medical officer self-isolated with symptoms.Boris Johnson tests positive for coronavirusIsolating the Prime Minister is not that difficult, in itself. The Downing Street premises are actually considerably bigger than they look from the outside. Behind that famous black door at Number 10 lies a warren of rooms and offices that extend sideways into 11 and 12 Downing Street -- the three addresses are all that survive from a longer terrace constructed at the end of the 17th century -- and back into a much larger 18th-century building at the rear. Johnson lives in a rather modest apartment above Number 11, which is easily shut off from Number 10. (A Downing Street spokesman said earlier on Friday that the connecting door between the two buildings would be shut.)  Anything that the Prime Minister needs, whether official papers or deliveries of food and drink, will be left outside a door for him to collect. However, in an effort to contain the virus, Downing Street will try to keep even this level of contact at a minimum.Read MoreMeetings will take place via video conference. While this might sound unusual, some of Johnson's most important regular appointments had already stopped being personal interactions. For example, recent meetings of the UK's Cabinet have taken place virtually. And Johnson's spokesperson confirmed that it had been at least two weeks since the Prime Minister's traditional weekly audience with the Queen had switched from being an in-person meeting at the Palace to a down-the-line phone call.Johnson spoke to the Quen via telephone this week.Inside 10 Downing Street itself, considered a place of work more than a place of residence, the roughly 250-strong teams of civil servants and political advisers has been stripped back to only essential workers, with approximately 70 people on site at any given time. Johnson's official spokesperson said that inside No 10, staff had been \"observing the advice on social distancing\" and using video conferencing wherever possible. However straightforward that sounds, there are legitimate questions at how sustainable it is to run a country in this manner.First, there are the Prime Minister's daily commitments.At the moment, Johnson's day has a familiar pattern. At 8:15 a.m, a team meets to discuss the latest coronavirus updates without the Prime Minister. That team consists of the chief medical officer (CMO), the chief scientific adviser (CSA), the Health Secretary and other Cabinet ministers whose presence might be relevant on a given day. JUST WATCHEDCNN reporter: 'Unimaginable' scenes in central LondonReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCNN reporter: 'Unimaginable' scenes in central London 02:48At 9:15 a.m, Johnson holds a meeting with secretaries of state, the CMO, CSA and various political advisers. That's when the government's daily agenda starts to take shape. The Prime Minister's day will typically be full of meetings with experts and advisers, leading up to a daily press conference, held at around 5 p.m. local time, where the government updates the UK's estimated 66 million citizens on the latest government guidelines and policy. The Prime Minster has so far led most of these events -- which in the past few days have been conducted with journalists dialing in via video link. Much of this work can be done effectively using technology -- or, in the case of the Prime Minister's absence from these press conferences, by deploying surrogates. However, shortly after Johnson's statement, one of his prominent stand-ins, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, confirmed that he too had the virus and would also be self-isolating. And later on Friday afternoon, Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, who has been at the center of the country's coronavirus response, confirmed that he had COVID-19 symptoms and would be self-isolating for seven days. He will also continue to work remotely. Just how many more people around the Prime Minister are at risk of having coronavirus? Despite its size, Downing Street is crammed full of small offices and narrow corridors. Top officials insist they have been taking the government's social distancing guidelines seriously, pointing journalists to a video from Thursday night of Johnson leaving Downing Street to take part in a national moment of applause for NHS workers, showing him standing a safe distance from his finance minister, Rishi Sunak, as he did so. Boris Johnson, right, standing at a distance from his finance minister, Rishi Sunak, on Thursday evening.However, others inside Downing Street privately complain that it is impossible fully to adhere to the 6ft social distance rules and that some people have been coming to work clearly displaying symptoms. For weeks, there had been speculation about how long it would take before coronavirus would hit heart of the British establishment. Westminster politics takes place in a small physical space in the SW1 postal district of London, rammed full of politicos, journalists, lobbyists and the rest. It's an insular network of people who, by the nature of what they do, rely on a huge amount of social interaction. The team around Boris Johnson were some of the last people standing in the wake of this crisis. Now we will see exactly how effectively a country like the UK can be run remotely.",

Different types of OCDDuring the coronavirus pandemic, Dr. Edwards has been providing advice via a regularly updated paper called \"Athlete Mental Health and Mental Illness in the era of COVID-19.\" One of the concerns the paper raises is for athletes who have pre-existing OCD.\"There are a lot of high level athletes who actually have clinical Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, but are able to manage it or have it treated in a way that they can function well and actually excel at their sport,\" said Dr. Edwards, who is based in Ontario, Canada.JUST WATCHEDSeb Coe: 'Absolutely the right decision' to postpone Tokyo 2020ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSeb Coe: 'Absolutely the right decision' to postpone Tokyo 2020 08:15\"I think having the ability to be organized and meticulous about details can be quite helpful in a lot of sports.\"There are lots of different types of OCD, but the contamination concern subtype, for example, would be very disrupted by something like a pandemic. \"These individuals are exceedingly worried about contamination and germs and infection at a baseline. And you add this and it can really throw things out the control.\"And some athletes have sent me pictures of their hands literally scrubbed down to the underlying muscle and tissue. And it's not necessarily fear that they're going to become ill themselves but fear that they're going to contaminate others. That can be quite disturbing.\"One study suggests that while OCD is common in 2.3% of adults, it's maybe as common as 5.2% in college athletes.READ: Japanese PM and IOC chief agree to postpone 2020 OlympicsSerena Williams spoke out about her struggles with self-isolation. Serena shining a lightOn Friday, Serena Williams revealed her anxiety and stress since she began social distancing during the coronavirus outbreak. \"By anxiety I mean I'm just on edge. Any time anyone sneezes around me or coughs I get crazy,\" the 23-time grand slam champion admitted on social media.Dr. Edwards says Serena's honesty will help other fellow sports people in this time of crisis.\"I think it's extremely helpful. It normalizes essentially what people are experiencing and for those who have struggled with mental illness in the past, sometimes it's hard for them to know what's normal anxiety or when is it normal to feel uncomfortable, versus when is it actually a part of their illness coming back,\" she said. \"To have validation that everybody's kind of feeling this to a certain extent and even the big names are going through a difficult time as well I think it's very, very helpful.\"Dr. Edwards has treated Canadian Olympians and athletes in swimming, athletics, hockey and cycling. During the pandemic she has been speaking with National Olympic Committees to ensure a sense of community is created for athletes. She's been impressed with how creative sports stars have become to work out in their homes.\"I've seen some really neat ones that cyclists are doing where they're creating group rides across the globe. And people can actually join in and join these Olympic cyclists as they're training,\" she added.\"Others are posting some really incredible athletic feats that they're managing to do in their basements and one guy posted that he ran a marathon on his balcony.\"Human interactionOlympic stars such as Great Britain's 200m World champion Dina Asher Smith, decathlon World record holder Kevin Mayer and United States Women's National Team forward Carli Lloyd have all tweeted their support of the postponement. But Dr. Edwards says some older athletes will struggle with the new time frame.\"The population of athletes who will likely be most disrupted by this are those who are on the cusp of the ends of their career and had planned to retire after Tokyo 2020, had planned to start families or enter into professional schools, medical schools, etc,\" added Dr. Edwards. \"This extra year now, while it gives them another opportunity to compete, will really throw the next few months into flux for them in terms of life planning.\"As athletes and people across the world continue to self-isolate and respect social distancing, Dr. Edwards' top tip for mental health during the pandemic is to maintain human interaction.\"I think the biggest thing is really ensuring that they are doing the daily foundations that they need for health, the basic things that everybody needs to do. Eating, sleeping, self-care, personal hygiene, making sure you get dressed every day,\" she said.\"Sometimes our athletes are operating on such a high level and traveling the world and just doing incredible things. They don't always think about the basics that everybody needs to do. And now they're in a situation where they're forced to and it's really sticking to basics that's going to help them and that includes human interaction. \"It can't be human contact right now, but human interaction is really, really important.\"",

Eight states have already passed bills to stop springing forward.It's up to Congress to approve them, but so far addressing daylight saving time hasn't been a federal priority.

        "content": "Cordoba, Spain (CNN)Unseasonably warm weather, Champions League football and other major events, homes on the beach and the caf\u00e9 culture: just a few of the factors that may have helped carry an insidious virus across southern Europe -- from country to country and city to city, from Italy to Spain and Portugal.The virulence and lethality of the coronavirus was compounded by the fact that symptoms take at least several days to emerge -- and by a series of missteps by governments as they chased its impact, before eventually succumbing to the reality that only a total lockdown could stem the tide.More than 5,000 people have died since a coronavirus outbreak exploded in Spain, one of the countries worst affected by the pandemic. The country has more than 54,000 active cases of the virus, according to recent figures from the ministry of health. On February 19, nearly 3,000 Valencia football fans traveled from Spain to Milan to watch their team play Atalanta in a European Champions League game. Some 40,000 Italians were also at the game, many of them from Bergamo and surrounding towns.Atalanta fans cheer during a Champions League match between their team and Valencia on February 19 in Milan. Milan was buzzing that evening, according to the Mayor of Bergamo, Giorgio Gori. Besides those who attended the game, \"others watched it from their homes, in families, in groups, at the bar,\" Gori said this week. \"It is clear on that evening there was an opportunity for a strong spread of the virus.\"Read MoreSpain is battling the black marketeers and price gougers of the coronavirus crisisImmunologist Francesco Le Foche is of the same view, telling the Corriere dello Sport: \"It's probable that there were several major triggers and catalysts for the diffusion of the virus, but the Atalanta-Valencia game could very well have been one of them.\"With hindsight, it was madness to play with a crowd present, but at the time things weren't clear enough,\" Le Foche said.Two days later, in the town of Codogno, some 60 kilometers (40 miles) from Bergamo, a 38-year-old man known as \"patient one\" was diagnosed with the virus. But by then, according to research reported by nearly 20 Italian specialists, the virus had long been on the move.Related storiesSpain is battling the black marketeers and price-gougers of the coronavirus crisisThe EU can't agree on how to help Italy and Spain pay for coronavirus reliefLive updates on the coronavirus\"At the time of detection of the first Covid-19 case, the epidemic had already spread in most municipalities of southern Lombardy,\" they say.After examining nearly 6,000 confirmed cases the researchers discovered that there were already 388 patients in the Lombardy region with novel coronavirus as early as February 19 -- even if they'd not yet been identified as such.\"In the week that followed, [the] Codogno area, as well as several neighboring towns in southern Lombardy, experienced a very rapid increase in the number of detected cases,\" the researchers note.Although the research has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal, it was mentioned in a report by the journal Nature on Friday.By then the visitors from Valencia were back home. One of them was sports journalist Kike Mateu. He told CNN that four days after returning home he had a cough and difficulty breathing. A few days later, \"I decided to go to the hospital because by then there was an explosion of coronavirus cases in Lombardy.\"People keep their distance from each other as they wait in a supermarket queue in Barcelona on March 16.On February 27, a health department spokesman in the Valencia region confirmed to CNN six new cases of coronavirus in the city. Three days later, a Portuguese man who had visited Valencia tested positive after returning home. Mateu passed it on to four of his co-workers, and Valencia football club would later report that more than a third of their players and coaching staff had tested positive for the virus. In the first week of March, the Spanish health ministry ordered large sporting events to be held behind closed doors, including the return leg of the Valencia-Atalanta tie.But in other respects, life in Spain went on pretty much as normal. Bars and cafes were open; unseasonably warm weather brought Spaniards out into common spaces. Rallies for International Women's Day on March 8 brought tens of thousands onto the streets across Spain, including a crowd estimated at 120,000 in Madrid. Two female cabinet ministers who attended the event later tested positive for coronavirus, although it's not known how they contracted the virus. Opposition parties have criticized the government for allowing those events to go ahead.Health workers prepare to receive the first coronavirus patients at Ifema exhibition complex in Madrid on March 22.The following week, the government moved to what its health minister, Salvador Illa, called \"reinforced containment.\" The main measure was to close schools and universities in Madrid from March 11. But this may not have had the intended effect.Hundreds of thousands of students enjoyed a sudden and unexpected holiday. Many Madrilenos left the capital, perhaps anticipating stricter measures. The roads were crowded when Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez declared on March 13 that a \"state of alarm\" would be introduced. But its details were left to a Cabinet meeting the following day.The EU can't agree on how to help Italy and Spain pay for coronavirus reliefEven before those details were published -- essentially putting Spain on lockdown -- local authorities in places like Murcia and Valencia began to close beaches and tell people from Madrid not to visit their homes on the coast.The following weekend, the Guardia Civil, the national police force, felt it necessary to tweet: \"Do not travel to your second residence at the beach, in the mountains or in the town.\"Durante el #finde estableceremos dispositivos en v\u00edas y espacios p\u00fablicos para asegurar el cumplimiento de las restricciones de la circulaci\u00f3n y se sancionar\u00e1 su incumplimiento#QuedateEnCasaNo viajes a tu 2\u00aa residencia en la playa, monta\u00f1a o el pueblo. pic.twitter.com/JM2RRmAUcg\u2014 Guardia Civil \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 (@guardiacivil) March 20, 2020\n\nThe overall response seemed disjointed, complicated by familiar rivalries between the central government and the regions -- especially Catalonia.Spain has certainly been far from alone in scrambling to keep up with the impact of coronavirus. As PM Sanchez himself has admitted, \"We can understand that right now every measure seems insufficient, but just a week ago it might have seemed exaggerated.\"Limiting freedoms is something a democratic government can do only when it is absolutely necessary,\" he told a session of parliament. Spain is still haunted by the Franco era and his iron rule from Madrid.On Thursday, Health Minister Salvador Illa spoke of a \"phase of stabilization\" in the trend of diagnoses, a hope echoed by the Director of Spain's Center for Health Emergencies Fernando Sim\u00f3n.Members of the Military Emergencies Unit (UME) carry out a general disinfection at Malaga airport on March 16, 2020. Even if true, the strain on the health service -- which Spaniards are proud of -- will continue for weeks to come. Thousands of health workers have been infected.The cost to the economy of the lockdown -- now extended for two more weeks -- will deepen. The Spanish government is demanding more forceful action from the European Union to finance recovery. And some awkward questions will begin to be asked. The government is already being sued by a Madrid attorney for allowing the March 8 rallies to go ahead. And Kike Mateu, now recovering in Valencia, is one of many thousands of Spaniards who are angry. \"Instead of isolating people, the government invited people to go out to the streets. And this is a huge irresponsibility.\"",

        "content": "London (CNN)British doctor Katie Sanderson hit breaking point over the weekend. As she advised the family of a Covid-19 patient on where their loved one should die, she received an image on her phone of crowds of people sunning themselves in a north London park. \"That made me hit a wall,\" the 32-year-old said, furious that members of the public were not heeding the government's social distancing advice as confirmed cases and deaths from the global Covid-19, or coronavirus, outbreak climbed in the UK. \"These people are going to contribute to somebody needlessly dying in two weeks' time.\" The rapidly rising number of deaths in Italy and Spain have placed Europe at the epicenter of the coronavirus crisis. Both countries now have higher death tolls than China, where the outbreak began, and with more than 7,500 fatalities Italy has the most deaths anywhere in the world. Londoners were criticized for ignoring social distancing rules.  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said last Sunday that the UK is only \"two or three\" weeks behind Italy, and warned that its National Health Service (NHS) could be \"overwhelmed\" by the virus, like its continental European counterparts. The following day, Johnson imposed the most stringent restrictions seen in Britain since the end of World War II, after it became clear that advice about social distancing was not being adhered to.The country's health workers are now bracing for a wave of Covid-19 patients. Sanderson's hospital, the Whittington in north London, is one of a number of UK facilities that has already attempted to scale up capacity and transform the way it is being run, in an effort to accommodate an increase of arrivals in the past week. An emergency medicine registrar at a north London hospital, Dr. Robert Lloyd, returned from holiday this week to find his department had changed radically. \"Over the last few days, it is empty in the morning and in the afternoon it gets flooded, literally flooded, completely at capacity, and all patients are almost perfectly positive [for coronavirus].\" Coronavirus is revealing how badly the UK has failed its most vulnerableRead MoreThis mirrors the situation at south London's King's College Hospital, which has spent weeks training staff and converting wards into intensive care units, according to a critical care worker, who wanted to remain anonymous out of concern that speaking publicly would put their job at risk. They added that the caseload \"has been pretty unprecedented.\" King's College Hospital told CNN that it has been \"training staff as required to be redeployed to support teams who are treating patients who test positive for Covid-19 as well as increasing bed capacity.\" CNN has spoken to more than a dozen health workers across England -- management of the NHS is devolved to the UK's four constituent nations --  who are anxious about how the disease will run its course in the country's much-loved but chronically underfunded health service. The case numbers are already increasing rapidly at hospitals in London, where coronavirus cases are rising faster than anywhere else in the country. King's College Hospital in  south London has been scaling up for the outbreak.Chris Hopson, head of NHS Providers, which represents hospital administrators, said London was facing a \"continuous tsunami\" of coronavirus patients. In an interview with BBC Radio 4 on Thursday, Hopson said London hospitals had increased critical care capacity by between five and seven times in the past few weeks, but are now struggling to meet the \"explosion of demand.\"In a statement to CNN, Hopson said the outbreak \"is by far the biggest challenge the NHS has ever faced in its history and it is striking how everyone is pulling together to prepare for the explosion in demand that is going to come.\"The critical care worker at King's said the main message that London health professionals want to get out to hospitals that have yet to be hit by cases is: \"Do the preparation, because without it you won't be able to cope.\"Rising anxietyFaced with a global pandemic, capacity was always going to be an issue for the NHS. The UK lags behind most OECD countries with just 2.1 acute hospital beds per 1,000 people. Germany, by comparison, has six beds for every 1,000 people. And while NHS England is one of the world's biggest employers, with 1.5 million people on staff, prior to the pandemic (between July and September 2018) it had 94,000 full time roles unfilled -- many of them in nursing. The British government, criticized for its less aggressive start in responding to the pandemic, has been attempting new measures to flatten the curve of new Covid-19 infections after a high-profile study found that coronavirus could overwhelm the number of intensive care beds and lead to 250,000 deaths in the UK.Here's why the coronavirus may be killing more men than women. The US should take noteIn a letter published March 17, NHS Chief Executive Simon Stevens said it was going to \"free up 30,000 (or more) of the English NHS's 100,000 general and acute beds,\" by postponing non-urgent operations, discharging medically fit patients, and \"block-buying capacity\" at private hospitals.  London's Excel Centre -- an exhibitions and conventions venue better known for its culinary fares and art exhibitions -- is being repurposed into a temporary hospital for 4,000 coronavirus patients, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced Tuesday. As confirmed cases topped 6,000 in the UK, as well as more than 400 coronavirus-related deaths, as of Tuesday Hancock said that almost 12,000 former health staff had agreed to return to help out with the crisis.London's Excel Centre is being turned into a temporary hospital. At the regular Downing Street briefing the following day, England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty said the NHS had been working hard to boost capacity in the system by \"pushing out in time things which can be postponed and increasing critical care, and particularly the ventilated bed capacity, over the next week.\"He said the present level of demand on hospitals was no worse than a normal winter day, but the number of cases was expected to rise and fighting the outbreak was \"going to be a close-run thing\" for the NHS.Here's why the coronavirus may be killing more men than women. The US should take noteThe government is also attempting to plug the shortage of ventilators in the UK. Hancock told the BBC on Monday that the NHS now has access to 12,000 ventilators, up from 5,000, and manufacturers were going to step up production of the respiratory aides.It was unclear how many of the 12,000 were immediately available, and in any case more ventilators require more staff to operate then. \"There is no point having ventilators if you don't have skilled people using it,\" Dr. David Oliver, a senior consultant in geriatrics and acute general medicine at a hospital in southeast England, told CNN. And while English hospitals undergo a \"major effort\" to expand intensive care beds, they are also training staff. \"What is happening all round the country is any nurse who had previous intensive care experience -- we are trying to get them upskilled again,\" Oliver said, adding a potential problem could be the current standard ratio of one nurse to one intensive care patient may have to be relaxed when hospitals hit peak capacity.The virus appears to impact older people much harder than younger patients.  But Lloyd, the north London doctor, told CNN that 30-year-olds were among the seriously ill patients he saw this week, whose x-rays \"look like a bomb had gone off on either side of their chest.\" Dwindling suppliesHealth workers across England have been sounding alarm bells about dwindling protective equipment. Nearly 4,000 doctors warned the government on Sunday that they could become \"cannon fodder\" for the virus due to inadequate PPE, according to a letter coordinated by the The Doctors' Association UK (DAUK), a group that lobbies for frontline NHS workers. DAUK told CNN Thursday that around 50 doctors have said they have no personal protective equipment (PPE), such as masks, gowns and gloves, and have had to buy their own on eBay or at DIY stores.The British Army has been deployed to deliver protective equipment to hospitals. He added that doctors outside London have also struggled to gain access to scrubs, which are typically only used in intensive care operating theaters. \"There's been no consideration for people who don't want to be wearing their own clothes [at hospitals] --  health workers want to change into scrubs so that they don't take that infection back home with them,\" Dr Rinesh Parmar, chair of the DAUK, told CNN.Family doctors, who in the UK are based in the community and are the place where most people turn first when they feel sick, say they feel neglected in this crisis. Two who CNN spoke to said that they are still conducting home visits without proper PPE. Related storiesRebel-held Syria braces for coronavirus \"tsunami\"Dyson to produce 10,000 ventilators for UK hospitalsTrack the spread of the coronavirusLive updates on the coronavirusThe government said 7.5 million pieces of protective equipment has been shipped out, but Dr. Pallavi Devulapalli, a general practitioner, told CNN that her practice in rural Norfolk has yet to receive new supplies. \"What keeps me up at night is that the hospital will be flooded, and that very ill people will have nowhere to go; and we will have to manage them in the community,\" she said. Doctors also complain that Public Health England (PHE) guidelines on protective equipment are not as stringent as World Health Organization (WHO) advice. PHE recommends that a health worker dealing with a suspected Covid-19 patient should wear an apron, surgical mask and gloves, as well as protective glasses if there is a risk of splashing. The WHO recommends a full gown and visor at all times.US, UK coronavirus strategies shifted following UK epidemiologists' ominous report\"It worries people because we don't have a clear reason\" for that discrepancy, said Dr. Adam Collins, an emergency doctor in central England.\"We're hearing from colleagues across continental Europe about what they're facing, they are a few weeks ahead of us and telling us, \"you need the right protection and you need to you need to be prepared,\" Parmar said. \"And we are not prepared, we don't have the right PPE yet the government still says: 'we've got adequate stock levels in the pandemic stockpile,'\" he added.On the frontlineHealth workers are falling sick, or having to self-isolate due to someone in their household displaying flu-like symptoms, even before the expected surge of UK infections. The problem is made worse by the lack of available testing to help determine if they have the virus or have developed immunity to it. On Friday, the BBC reported that a doctor in Essex, outside London, died after showing \"textbook signs\" of the virus.Official statements on testing have been contradictory. An official from PHE, Sharon Peacock, told a parliamentary committee on Wednesday that the government could be days away from rolling out an at-home test for COVID-19 antibodies, which would allow people to check if they'd had the disease. England's chief medical officer, Whitty, poured cold water over the claim on Wednesday. \"I do not think, and I want to be clear, that this is something you will suddenly be ordering on the internet next week,\" Whitty said. Chris Whitty has taken part in many of the daily Downing Street briefings. The government says testing capacity is being ramped up but health workers say it has not happened fast enough. Collins, who is 28, spent Tuesday morning writing his will after it was announced that 23 Italian doctors had died since the outbreak started. That toll increased to 37 on Wednesday, according to the Italian federation of doctors.Frontline workers have had to rely on models, rather than testing data, to help estimate the surge in caseload in the coming weeks. Parmar, from DAUK, said Britain had \"abandoned testing in the community so we really don't know what our population contamination and infection rates are.\"\"Think about it, we are testing between 8,000 and 10,000 patients a day -- but we need to be in the hundreds of thousands by now, and the UK has had a head start, we knew this [virus] was coming,\" Parmar said. Comparing the UK's testing response to other countries is unhelpful as their outbreaks have a \"different epidemic pattern,\" Whitty said Wednesday, adding that screening people from high-risk countries had ceased to be a sensible policy.   The people helping strangers during the coronavirus pandemic\"We moved onto testing people in intensive care and in hospitals...that system is working fine and is being scaled up,\" he added. While testing of NHS staff and critical workers needed to grow, he explained that the UK was contending with supply shortages due to high global demand.Dr. Partha Kar, a consultant at Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust, says he worries about infecting his loved ones. \"Personally it has been a little bit tough because my mum and dad have come here from India to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary -- so now they're trapped,\" he said, adding that his house has been split into zones in an attempt to social distance from his parents. Some health workers say they dread the point when they will have to begin making ethical decisions currently being made by their Italian colleagues. An Italian doctor at Salvatore Hospital in L'Aquila told CNN that a lack of equipment was forcing colleagues to triage patients, choosing the young over the old because of the probability they are more likely to live. \"It is absolutely terrifying to think that there could be someone in front of you that you've got the medicine to be able to treat,\" the critical care worker at King's said. \"But if you have one bed left in the hospital: do you treat the 60-year-old that's got kidney failure and diabetes, or do you treat the 30-year-old who is normally fit and healthy?\"      Health workers say a full accounting of official failures will have to wait for now. They are too busy preparing and taking part in practice drills on how to save lives. They were, however, unreserved in their criticism of certain companies and members of the public who have chosen to flout social distancing rules despite official advice.\"I think people have been selfish,\" Dr. Stuart Hanmer, a junior doctor working in central England, told CNN. \"They have to take this matter into their own hands, and help us, the NHS, to slow down the course of this virus.\" As the days tick down, many spoke in war analogies as they waited for the unprecedented peak of infections. \"It feels like when the soldiers are preparing for battle, before the sound of the horn,\" Dr. Bogdan Chiva Giurca, a junior doctor at a hospital in Surrey, just outside of London, told CNN.Lloyd, the north London registrar, said he was \"frightened for the implications the virus has for society, it is going to have a major impact and a huge body count.\" He added that he is ready for battle, however. \"From a professional standpoint, this is a defining moment for most of us -- so much of our training has set us up for this.\"CNN's Dominic Rech contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Most Europeans are currently living under severe restrictions, stuck at home, desperately hoping for the coronavirus pandemic to pass soon. On the flip side: the air is cleaner than it's been in a long time.The huge decline in road traffic, air travel and other business activities across Europe has led to sharp reductions in pollution over several major cities, new images published by the European Space Agency show. A similar effect has been recorded across the United States and in China. The impact of the pandemic-related restrictions on air quality is staggering. In some parts of Europe, the levels of toxic pollutants in the air have been slashed by a half. But while the short-term effect might seems positive, experts are warning that the current situation is no solution.China's coronavirus lockdown curbs deadly pollution, likely saving the lives of tens of thousands, says researcherRead More\"Addressing long-term air quality problems requires ambitious policies and forward-looking investments,\" said Hans Bruyninckx, the EEA executive director. \"As such, the current crisis and its multiple impacts on our society work against what we are trying to achieve, which is a just and well-managed transition towards a resilient and sustainable society,\" he added.The ESA observations by the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite show clear declines in pollution. The measurements were taken over 10 days to even out changes in the weather, which affect the concentration of nitrogen dioxide.      Data from the European Environmental Agency paint a similar picture. The average concentrations of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) in the air in the Italian province of Bergamo, which has been completely paralyzed by the outbreak, were 47% lower last week than during the same week last year, the environmental agency said. The NO2 levels in Rome were 26% to 35% lower than in 2019, the environmental agency said. Much of the NO2 pollution comes from car exhausts, which is why the strict controls on citizens movements led to such dramatic declines. Similar declines have been observed in the US. Images taken over the first three weeks of March show significantly lower concentrations of NO2 in much of California, where places including the Bay Area and Central Valley have implemented stricter social distancing guidelines.      Another area hit hard by the virus, western Washington state around Seattle, also shows much lower concentrations of the gas in recent weeks.The pandemic has had similar effects on air pollution in China, which still ranks poorly in global air quality comparisons, despite its government's major efforts to tackle pollution in recent years. According to China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment, the average number of \"good quality air days\" increased 21.5% in February, compared to the same period last year in Hubei province, the epicenter of the global coronavirus pandemic.NASA images show a decrease in China's pollution related to coronavirus shutdownSome scientists said the radical improvement in air quality could save lives. Marshall Burke, an assistant professor at Stanford's Department of Earth System Science, said the better air quality in China alone could have saved between 50,000 and 75,000 people from premature deaths.\"Does this mean pandemics are good for health? No,\" Burke said. \"Instead it means that the way our economies operate, absent pandemics, has massive hidden health costs, and it takes a pandemic to help see that.\"The link between air pollution and premature deaths has been well established. A 30-year analysis of 652 cities in 24 countries and regions across six continents found that increases in air pollution were linked to increases in related deaths: The higher the levels of pollution, the faster people die. The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that around 7 million people die every year from exposure to fine particles in polluted air.",

There are a ridiculous number of bars and cafes per capita, and as the weather warms Andalusians begin the evening paseo, wandering the narrow streets and watching the world go by over a beer and tapas.But not this year.Easter week -- Semana Santa -- in Andalusia is arguably more important than Christmas, a time for candle-lit parades, the caminos de pasion, to celebrate the Virgin Mary and the resurrection of Jesus. Centuries-old floats, held aloft by 20 men or more, lurch through the streets and the air is heavy with incense.Crowds watch the procession during Holy Week in Priego de Cordoba in 2009.Except not this year; they are canceled. The authorities are promising Easter celebrations will happen, but in September.Coronavirus in our worldWhen social distancing extends to the birth of your child by Saskya VandoorneFrench villagers find parallels with World War II by Jim BittermannMass and brunch online: My new Sunday by Michelle KrupaQuarantined away from my family ... in the same house by Martin SavidgeSorrow and gratitude in the American twilight by Thomas LakeFernando Alcala Zamora, a young journalist in my hometown of Priego de Cordoba, says the change of lifestyle is utterly alien to Andalusians.Read More\"I think quarantine or 'social distancing' are terms that contradict the very definition of how we relate with each other and enjoy our days, of who we are, so it's a big challenge for many,\" he said.Gone are the kisses on both cheeks, the casual street encounters in this most tactile of cultures. To see Andalusians talk to each other more than a meter apart is perhaps the most stunning visual manifestation of the virus' impact. Debbie Skyrme, an English friend who lives on the coast, says \"the sublimation of the gregarious nature of the Spanish people is so shocking; it shows how seriously people are taking this situation.\"Easter week processions normally draw huge crowds.Now people are staying home, waiting for the chimes of 8 p.m. That's the hour when they emerge to applaud the work of Spain's doctors and nurses, the police, local authority workers who spray public spaces with disinfectant and others providing essential services. As one local quipped, \"It's the only occasion we are ever on time.\"Almost every apartment and house has at least one balcony, and they are now a precious outlet for every community. Throughout the province -- from Seville to Cordoba and Granada to the white-walled mountain villages -- people take part in the #aplausosolidario every evening.For some, Spaniards and the large expatriate community alike, it's a release for all the pent-up emotions and the claustrophobia of the day. \"The anticipation of 8 p.m. every night is an infectious excitement that recharges us all and gives us the strength to get through it all the next day,\" says Skyrme.Spain is on lockdown due to the coronavirus outbreak, with police manning checkpoints.Later in the evenings, the younger generation still share a drink together, but now they gather online.For now at least, the solidarity is impressive. More than a few households around Priego de Cordoba have woken up to find fresh vegetables and eggs left at their front door. I visited three grocery stores: the shelves were well-stocked and people were not buying dozens of toilet rolls.There is patience, a touch of fatalism and some wicked online humor. But there's also an undercurrent of anxiety -- and it's driven by two distinct factors.The first is concern for the elderly, not least because in many rural households there are often three generations living under one roof, increasing the risk of transmission. Almost everyone I have spoken to in the last week has mentioned this. As of Friday, Priego de Cordoba had three cases of coronavirus. There is still a sense of utter disbelief that a strange illness in China on the evening news last month is now here.The other anxiety is the specter of 2008, when the Spanish economy fell into a deep recession as the banking and property sectors imploded and unemployment soared. Here and across Spain, restaurants then offered a cheap \"anti-crisis\" menu. Small businesses went to the wall.It took six years for most households to recover. Spain has posted healthy growth in the last couple of years, but now another recession looms. Andalusia has two main sources of income -- tourism on the coast and agriculture inland.Spain is the second most-visited country in the world, more than 83 million in 2019 as a whole. There were more than 7 million visitors in April last year. But now hotels on the coast are closing or are already shuttered. Some have offered themselves as recuperation centers for coronavirus patients -- but they all face a season of ruin.Agriculture is a hugely important part of the local economy.Andalusia is the largest producer of olive oil in the world, and Priego's is among the best anywhere, frequently winning international prizes. But even before coronavirus invaded, farmers here were blocking roads to protest lower prices. A global recession will push consumers to cheaper sources.At least coronavirus arrived just as the olive harvest finished. Picking the olives is an arduous three-month slog on steep slopes, and frequently a family business. Take away one parent to look after kids no longer at school and the work doesn't get done.Olive farmers just managed to get their harvest finished before coronavirus struck Spain.Francisco Granados is one of those olive farmers and one of the most optimistic souls you could hope to meet. But even he is subdued.\"We have been barely able to leave the house for a week, only to buy food, medicine and go out to work,\" Granados said.He and his wife Montse are desperately trying to keep their two children occupied. In the tightly knit communities here, kids are used to roaming free. At the height of summer, the playgrounds and squares are still full at 1 a.m. That won't happen in 2020 -- unless the virus is conquered in miraculously quick time.Alcala Zamora told me: \"Right now we're all trying to grasp how long the quarantine situation will last, because every week with it will mean bad news for the country and people's lives.\"Malaga airport, bustling with holidaymakers from the UK, Scandinavia and the Netherlands 10 months a year, was eerily quiet when I finally got back last week. Workers in full hazmat kit were spraying seats and baggage carousels.I went to shake the hand of the guy who looks after my car when I am traveling. He recoiled, embarrassed. I apologized for being two weeks late in returning and blamed the news. \"No extra charge,\" he said. \"And I washed the car.\"It was sort of emblematic.

        "content": "(CNN)The brother of Abdelhak Nouri says things are \"much better than before\" now that the former Ajax star has returned home from hospital. But the 22-year-old is still very dependent on his family. Nouri collapsed during a pre-season friendly against Werder Bremen in the summer of 2017, suffering serious and permanent brain damage as a result. Appie, as he is known among his former teammates, was just 20-years-old when he was placed into an induced coma. In 2018, his family said they were encouraged by small improvements in his condition as he began to wake up, and Nouri has since returned to a specially adapted home. Despite being able to communicate by smiling and raising his eyebrows, Nouri is still bedridden, his brother Abderrahim says.Read More\"He's just awake. He sleeps, he sneezes, he eats, he burps, but it's not like he gets out of bed,\" he said on Dutch television series De Wereld Draait Door on Thursday.\"We talk to him like he's not sick. We take him into our conversations and we watch football with him in the living room, for example. Then he watches.\"You notice that he likes that very much. He often shows emotions. Sometimes he is emotional, but often there is also a smile. That does us good. That makes you really appreciate a smile.\" READ: Jean-Pierre Adams -- The 38-year coma that can't stop loveAbdelhak Nouri of Ajax in action during a UEFA Europa League match in 2016.Hoping for a miracle Nouri played 15 league and cup games for Ajax in 2016-17, scoring one goal in a Dutch Cup tie. Born in Amsterdam to parents of Moroccan descent, he also played for Holland's Under-15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 teams.After the incident, his family was told he wouldn't be able to talk, eat or move independently because he had been starved of oxygen.In June 2018, Ajax admitted to providing \"inadequate\" on-field medical treatment following his collapse.However, Nouri's father Mohammed says the family is still holding out for a miracle.\"The intention is that Appie keeps getting better,\" he told De Wereld Draait Door.\"We have to take care of him as best we can. We try to do a lot ourselves. We have less nurses and help in the home now. We do a lot ourselves.\"\"Here beats a Ajax heart,\" reads a banner in the garden in front of the Nouri house in 2017.'It was a pleasure to be on the same field'Nouri was the focus of the television show in the Netherlands which looked back at his life, with interviews from family and a host of former teammates. Current Ajax first-team star Donny van de Beek, is a close family friend and remembered how talented Nouri was when making his way through the ranks.\"He had that something special. He was a fantastic footballer, but also a fantastic person,\" he said.\"He had the technique, but in his head, he was always one step ahead. He did things that made you think, how did you do that? \"It made you enjoy the game, and it just made you laugh sometimes. It was a pleasure to be on the same field as him.\"Barcelona star Frenkie de Jong, who only left Ajax at the end of last season, says his former teammate influenced his decision to move to the Catalan club.\"Appie's mother came into the hospital room and she started naming off some of the clubs that were interested in me,\" De Jong said.\"Then she said 'Barcelona, should he go to Barcelona?' and Appie gave a kind of signal that he agreed with that. It was for me  and my family, a very good moment.\"",

It was a day she will never forget.  \"I celebrated it alone,\" the five-time Olympic champion told CNN. \"A few days before my birthday, I went on a grocery run, something I've been doing much less frequently, and I bought a box of cookies. I face-timed with my parents and my brother, and had a cookie.\" It has been a tough few weeks for the swimmer. As a pandemic spread around the world, the uncertainty over whether or not the Tokyo Olympics, originally scheduled to start in July, would go ahead affected her mental health. \"Not knowing what was going to happen with the Games was overwhelming and draining. We knew they shouldn't happen,\" added Ledecky, appreciating there are more serious matters to grapple with than this summer's Games. Read MoreREAD: Mallory Weggemann offers powerful example of mental fortitudeLedecky celebrates after winning gold in the Women's 800m Freestyle final at Rio 2016.\"You just can't hold an Olympics in the middle of a pandemic. We could see that, but when we weren't getting the official word we felt like had to try to do our best with training.  \"We were trying to be so conscientious about not wanting to put everyone else at risk, and we didn't want to put our health at risk either. Everything we were doing was taking a toll on our mental health.\"On Tuesday, after weeks of speculation, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach agreed to postpone Tokyo 2020 until 2021.What are organizers up against now the 2020 Olympics have been moved to next year?But even last week the IOC and organizers were insisting the Games would go ahead this summer, which meant Ledecky had to find a way to train regardless. When her regular training facility at Stanford University closed its doors on March 13, Ledecky and a half dozen other swimmers -- including fellow Olympic Champion Simone Manuel -- had nowhere to go. Her community came to the rescue. Ledecky called longtime sports broadcaster Ted Robinson who found a private club in the area that had a 25-yard pool, which is under half the size of an Olympic-length pool. Ledecky, Manuel, Stanford Coach Greg Meehan -- who is also the head coach of the US women's swimming team -- and four other swimmers spent three days training there, before that facility was eventually shut by the mandatory shelter-in-place order set into effect by California Governor Gavin Newsom. And then came more restrictions. Ledecky was faced with difficult questions: should she fly to Florida to train? Should she fly home to Maryland? She didn't want to risk getting sick, or put anyone else at risk, so she decided it was best to stay put. Ledecky ended up swimming in her neighbor's pool. The most prolific female swimmer the world has ever seen, a winner of 15 world titles, was training in a backyard swimming pool. A world class facility the pool was not, but it felt therapeutic to just swim. After all, swimmers need water to train. It's the medium they live in. Without it, a swimmer is like a musician without an instrument.

The water sessions are so important. You get into such a rhythm in the water and if you can't stay in that routine for a couple of days, it can really set you back,\" she said. \"The longest break I've taken over the last eight years, or maybe even longer, has been two weeks out of the water.\"After those two weeks, it took two months to start feeling normal and in shape in the water. It would have been extremely difficult for us if the Games were held this summer.

Ledecky, who intends to compete to at least 2024, will now prepare for Tokyo next year. She has been number one in the world in the women's 800m freestyle for the last eight years -- a feat no male or female swimmer has accomplished. It's a testament to her dominance and determination. \"I started swimming when I was six years old,\" she said. \"At around the age 11 or 12 I started to ditch the other sports I was playing. I broke my arm in fourth grade playing basketball and that was a turning point for me. \"I started picking swim practice over basketball and soccer and that's around the same time I started with the early morning practices -- getting up at 4:45  in the morning when I was 10 or 11 years old. I started getting up at four in the morning two or four times a week all throughout high school, and I've swam nine to 10 times a week for many years now. \"It's a grind and it's a lot of work, and some people watch the Olympics and think it just comes around every four years but for us it is every single day.\"For now, Ledecky's everyday likely includes moving through her neighbor's pool. At some point in the next two months, she will take a substantial break from training for her mental and physical health. Now in her fourth year studying psychology at Stanford, she plans to resume online classes again in two weeks.READ: Athletes come to terms with 'heartbreaking' Tokyo 2020 postponementLedecky competes in the Women's 1500 LC Meter Freestyle final at the 2019 Toyota U.S. Open Championships.\"I've tried to stick to a routine each day.

        "content": "London (CNN)The UK's response to the coronavirus pandemic was upended on Friday when the Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his top health minister tested positive for the infection, and his chief medical adviser self-isolated after displaying symptoms. Johnson announced his diagnosis in a remarkable video posted on social media, in which he said he would continue to lead the UK government's efforts from self-isolation in an apartment in Downing Street. Minutes later, his secretary of state for health, Matt Hancock, also said he had the virus and would work from home.The Prime Minister said he'd been tested on the advice of  England's chief medical officer, Chris Whitty. A matter of hours later, Whitty said he was going into self-isolation after displaying symptoms of Covid-19.Over the last 24 hours I have developed mild symptoms and tested positive for coronavirus.I am now self-isolating, but I will continue to lead the government's response via video-conference as we fight this virus.Together we will beat this. #StayHomeSaveLives pic.twitter.com/9Te6aFP0Ri\u2014 Boris Johnson #StayHomeSaveLives (@BorisJohnson) March 27, 2020\n\nThe extraordinary developments raised the question of how many officials leading the UK's response to coronavirus had themselves been exposed to it. Downing Street, the center of power in the UK, is a maze of cramped offices and narrow corridors, making it almost impossible for everyone working there to practice the government's own advice on social distancing.On Thursday evening, after displaying symptoms but before learning the result of his test, Johnson appeared outside 10 Downing Street with his chief finance minister, Rishi Sunak, taking part in a national moment of appreciation for the UK's health service workers. A Downing Street spokesperson said the pair were careful to remain at a safe distance.Boris Johnson, right, taking part in a national applause with his chancellor, Rishi Sunak.Read MoreJohnson was a late convert to the strict measures now in place in the UK.  Only a few weeks ago, he boasted of shaking the hands of coronavirus patients in hospital, and the UK faced criticism for a more cautious approach to the restrictive measures adopted by its European neighbors. \"Over the last 24 hours I have developed mild symptoms and tested positive for coronavirus,\" Johnson said in his Friday Twitter post. \"I am now self-isolating, but I will continue to lead the government's response via video-conference as we fight this virus. Together we will beat this.\"In a video, Johnson said he was experiencing a temperature and a persistent cough, which are key symptoms of the virus. He added that he was working from home and self-isolating. \"But be in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fightback against coronavirus,\" he said.Doctors say they're like 'soldiers preparing for battle,' as UK braces for worst of the coronavirus surgeJohnson will work in isolation from his four-bedroom apartment in Downing Street. The infection also raises concerns over Johnson's fiancee, Carrie Symonds, who is pregnant, and the myriad of other officials and advisers who work in close quarters in Downing Street.Whitty, who has appeared alongside Johnson at many of the daily press conferences held at Downing Street in the past two weeks, said he would spend the next week at home. \"After experiencing symptoms compatible with COVID-19 last night, in line with the guidance, I will be self-isolating at home for the next seven days. I will be continuing to advise the Government on the medical response to Coronavirus, supported by my deputies,\" Whitty wrote on his Twitter page.The announcements  come just over a week after a top government adviser on the virus, Neil Ferguson, said he believed he had been infected and warned: \"There is a lot of Covid-19 in Westminster,\" referring to the area of London that is home to the UK Parliament and other government premises.Ferguson had met with the Prime Minister, as well as Whitty, and Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance. It was unclear, however, where Johnson may have contracted the virus.Days earlier, the heir to the UK throne, Prince Charles, revealed that he had contracted the virus and was isolating himself at his estate in Scotland.Johnson had been criticized for continuing to shake people's hands in public while government advice was to keep around two meters away from other people. The Prime Minister, Whitty and Vallance have been giving regular in-person press conferences to journalists on the virus after meetings.All the virtual concerts, plays, museums and other culture you can enjoy from homeHis government has also come under pressure to test for the virus more widely and to provide WHO standard protective gear for doctors and nurses across the country. In the event that Johnson is unable to fulfill all his duties as prime minister, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab would be expected to stand in his place.   Raab previously served as Brexit Secretary under the government led by Theresa May. He stepped down after the UK and EU agreed on a draft Brexit deal, which he claimed had \"fatal flaws.\"Johnson last met with Queen Elizabeth II on March 11, Buckingham Palace said Friday. \"The Queen last saw the PM on the 11th March and is following all the appropriate advice with regards to her welfare,\" the palace said in a statement.British health authorities announced another 181 fatalities on Friday, bringing the death toll to 759. More than 14,500 infections have been recorded, but as the UK is not testing widely, true infection numbers are likely to be much higher.",

        "content": "Moscow (CNN)Just over a week ago, President Vladimir Putin said Russia had the spread of coronavirus \"under control.\" Now the country is changing tactics, as authorities acknowledge they are gearing up for a major Covid-19 outbreak.In a nationwide address Wednesday, Putin conceded that it was \"objectively impossible to stop [coronavirus] from spilling over\" into a country of Russia's size. He urged Russians to \"understand the complexity of the situation\" and stay home, declaring next week to be a paid stay-at-home holiday. It was a classic presidential performance, but Putin stopped short of delivering a bitter pill to the public. While he announced a number of measures to bolster the country's economy and encouraged citizens to stay home, he left it to other officials to announce more sweeping lockdown measuresOn the morning following his speech, the Russian government announced it would seal its borders and cancel all international flights, with the exception of repatriation planes that are expected to bring thousands more Russians home from hard-hit areas.Related storiesMoscow imposes 'unprecedented' shutdownUS shatters record for jobless claimsTrack the spread of the coronavirusLive updates on the coronavirusOther officials are taking the coronavirus effort a step further. For days, the Kremlin had insisted that plans to quarantine residents of the capital were not on the table. But on Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin effectively moved to hit the pause button for the country's most vibrant economy, closing all restaurants, cafes, bars, shops and parks in the capital for a week starting Saturday.Read MoreThose measures are the strictest Russia has seen so far, as its official coronavirus toll began to increase rapidly. On Thursday, health officials reported the largest one-day increase to date with 182 new cases, bringing the total number to 840. Three people have died of Covid-19, according to Johns Hopkins University.The official narrative around the dangers the virus poses to Russia has also begun a subtle shift. Here, again, Moscow has taken the lead. Top Russian officials originally said preventive measures, such as closing the borders with China and testing people coming back from badly affected areas like Iran, helped delay the outbreak. But the country did not immediately move to take samples from people coming elsewhere, especially Europe. The majority of early cases in Russia were reported to have been brought from Italy. And on Tuesday, Mayor Sobyanin took the unusual public step of telling Putin in a meeting that previous official figures had likely been underestimated, as many Russians returning from trips abroad did not get tested. Russian Rosguardia (National Guard) soldiers speak to pensioners in Moscow, as the city ordered residents over 65 and those suffering from chronic conditions to stay home for 19 days.\"Half of all people who came from abroad passed through Moscow, and the Muscovites themselves love to travel as well,\" Sobyanin said late Wednesday after Putin's address, referring to well-heeled Russians who often like to spend spring breaks at French ski resorts. \"Many people have also visited Courchevel and brought a suitcase of viruses from there.\"The messages, however, remain mixed. Despite the alarming trajectory of cases, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in a conference call Thursday that there was no need to panic in Russia.\"There is no de facto epidemic [here],\" Peskov said. \"And de facto our situation is much better than in many countries, that is definitely due to the measures that our government began to take in advance in advance.\"The numbers are likely to continue to grow quickly, now that private testing is available locally and the government has issued a directive to test everyone arriving in Russia.Meanwhile, the medical professionals are preparing in case things get much worse, with local governments rushing to buy ventilators and expand ICU capacities.Nikolai Malyshev, the chief infectious diseases specialist with the Moscow branch of the health ministry, warned that an \"explosive development like a nuclear reaction\" is not out of the question, suggesting that \"a huge number of people will be infected.\"\"At first, we saw a linear increase of patients,\" Malyshev said in an interview aired late Wednesday on the state-run Russia 1 channel. \"But now it is exponential.\"It remains to be seen, then, if the Kremlin's messaging will fall in line with that reality.",

Stone creates arrangements from flowers that have been thrown out by supermarkets and other suppliers once they hit their expiration date. At the time, Stone told CNN she hoped the flowers would \"bring a little bit of cheer to people's lives.\"She has had to stop her arrangements since tighter restrictions were put in place in the UK around social movements.",

        "content": "(CNN)It was on Sunday morning in Geneva, that the proverbial extinguishing of the Olympic flame -- at least for Tokyo 2020 -- effectively began.At the headquarters of the World Health Organization, the ever-growing numbers of those infected by the coronavirus outbreak caused alarm for International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach.The previous bullishness over staging the Games later this year that had been shown by Bach, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Tokyo 2020 organizers showed its first cracks as the number Olympic nations affected by the global pandemic began to soar.Bach's eyes were drawn to the data from Africa as the continent became the latest to feel the full force of the pandemic. That Sunday morning, the former German fencer called an emergency meeting of the IOC's executive board for later that day.Read MoreThe meeting was to be made up of Bach, four vice-presidents and 10 other members, including the former pole vaulter Sergey Bubka and Kirsty Coventry, Africa's most decorated swimmer with seven Olympic medals and now the sports minister in her native South Africa.READ: When the Olympics are stoppedAfter being subjected to accusations that it had buried its head in the sand while virtually every other major sporting event was called off, the IOC was now actively discussing postponement. Bach had already spoken with Tokyo 2020 President Yoshiro Mori, a man who had the ear of Abe. All parties made it clear that cancellation was not an option but the dreaded P word -- postponement -- was now very much on the table.By the end of the executive board meeting, Bach learned \"new alarming information\" that the virus had spread to islands in Oceania, with a raft of travel restrictions imposed in many of the Olympic nations.The Olympic cauldron is lit during the 'Flame of Recovery' special exhibition at Aquamarine Park a day after the postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games.READ: 'Heartbreaking,' but Covid-19 is 'way bigger' than Olympics postponementThe blows kept coming thick and fast. Bach received a letter from World Athletics President Sebastian Coe, with whom the IOC chief goes back many years.\"I write to you to request that the Games be moved,\" said Coe. \"No one wants to see the Olympic Games postponed but, as I have said publicly, we cannot hold the event at all costs, certainly not at the cost of athlete safety, and a decision on the Olympic Games must become very obvious very quickly.\"I believe that time has come and we owe it to our athletes to give them respite where we can.\"JUST WATCHEDSeb Coe: 'Absolutely the right decision' to postpone Tokyo 2020ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSeb Coe: 'Absolutely the right decision' to postpone Tokyo 2020 08:15READ: What happened the last time the Olympics was stoppedStranded in New MexicoThe domino effect gathered more momentum when Canada became the first nation to officially withdraw its teams from Tokyo 2020, notifying the world of its intention in a statement entitled \"Postpone Today Conquer Tomorrow.\"The next day Australia followed suit saying it had told its athletes to prepare for a 2021 Games, while British athletes training abroad were called home by the UK Foreign Office.International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach (L) and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe shake hands prior to their meeting at Abe's official residence in Tokyo on March 13, 2015. For two-time Olympic champion Alistair Brownlee, it meant an abrupt end to a training camp that had been scheduled to run until the end of April in New Mexico.For the triathlete and his brother Jonny, twice a medalist at the past two Games behind him, there was no choice but to book a flight home for the following day.Until that point, they had trained as though the Games were going ahead, the thinking being that a deserted training base might be a safer location.\"That was the best place to train but we were balancing it with the worry that if we stay another week we might not be able to get home for three or even six months,\" Alistair Brownlee, the son of doctors working to help combat in the coronavirus outbreak, told CNN.JUST WATCHEDMarathon superstar on Olympic postponementReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMarathon superstar on Olympic postponement 10:27Earlier that Monday morning in Europe, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had called on G20 leaders to address the global pandemic's acceleration.It was at this point that the IOC made the first formative steps to postpone the Games, forewarning that such a position would be taken in the call scheduled between Bach and Abe at 11 a.m. Lausanne time on Tuesday.Before that the US, arguably the world's most powerful Olympic nation, played its hand, saying a postponement was the only option.Even before the call between Bach and Abe had begun, Japanese broadcaster NHK reported that that Japanese prime minster was proposing a postponement of the Games -- unthinkable barely a few weeks ago -- until 2021.READ: Japan PM and IOC chief agree Games postponementPolitical corruption scandalThe IOC is in a sense a private members' club -- albeit one overseeing the world's biggest sporting event --  but postponement wasn't a decision it could afford to take unilaterally.The IOC was concerned that if it pulled the plug, it would be considered in breach of contract,  effectively putting the organization's head on the block in terms of the financial impact, which one of the world's leading sports lawyers John Mehrzad argued could \"run into the billions with TV rights, suppliers rights, economic loss of hotels, the list goes on.\"And what of the Japanese government's obligations? Mehrzad makes the point that the wider ramifications of the postponement are only just beginning to play out.\"It's unfathomable to not think that financial and legal implications are at the forefront for the IOC and Japan in this,\" he added. \"This is going to be so messy and difficult, these are crippling figures.\"People wearing face masks chat next to the Olympic Rings on March 13, 2020 in Tokyo, Japan. READ: How one athlete put off children for TokyoFor Abe, there are also political consequences.Olympic Games often provide a moment to bring together a nation, but after Tuesday's conversation with Bach, the Japanese prime minister knew postponement had become the only option, however potentially damaging politically, financially and legally.Alistair Brownlee received the news in New Mexico before he dashed to the airport.\"I was really disappointed but there was relief too,\" Brownlee told CNN Sport. \"For me, the shift of a year doesn't make too much difference although logically I'll be a year older so it might be harder.\"But it's hard for the younger athletes building for say eight years to a first Games. If that had happened to me at London 2012 [his first Games and first gold] that would have had a massive effect. With two Olympics, it leaves me in a better place to deal with it.\"For some athletes injured, the announcement proved a blessing, for others preparing for life away from the Games post-2020 it left tougher choices.A woman in a face mask walks past a display showing the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games logo in Tokyo on March 24, 2020.'Huge jigsaw puzzle'Bach and the IOC now face a potential logistical nightmare in rearranging the Games.\"This is like a huge jigsaw puzzle -- every piece has to fit,\" said Bach on Tuesday. \"If you take out one piece, the whole puzzle is destroyed. Everything has to come together. \"We have no blueprint but we are confident we can put a beautiful jigsaw puzzle together and have a wonderful Olympic Games.\"When they officially announced the postponement, Bach and Abe said that the \"Olympic flame could become the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present.\"The Olympic flame might continue to burn, but Bach has had a tough job firefighting over the last few days.Asked on Wednesday whether he personally had any regrets about the handling of the crisis and therefore subsequently considered resigning from his position, Bach said simply: \"No.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)It was meant to be the first Games to be held beyond Europe and North America, a spectacle to showcase to the world that Tokyo had overcome the earthquake that had devastated the city some years earlier. But the 1940 Olympics was the Games that never was.No one aged under 80 had ever lived through a time when the Olympics was postponed or canceled until Tuesday's announcement that Tokyo 2020, originally scheduled to start this July, will now be held next year. As a pandemic takes hold of the world and the International Olympic Committee and Tokyo 2020 organizers grapple with the complicated logistics involved in holding the greatest show on earth later than planned, a look at the past throws up some uncanny similarities between now and what has been described by some as the Lost Games of 1940.At a Christmas party in Tokyo, on the right is a large cake with the inscription 1940 XII Olympiad Tokyo to celebrate the upcoming Olympics in Japan.Glory on the world stageBefore the 2020 Olympics was postponed, sport's biggest extravaganza has been called off three times in modern history, all in wartime, and the last time being the year Tokyo was supposed to be the host city. Read MoreIt was the success of Japan's athletes at the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles and international criticism of the country's invasion of Manchuria in 1931, as the Japanese empire continued to expand into China, which helped persuade the country's government to fully support an Olympic bid, something which had previously been the preserve of elite cities in the west. Japan's male swimmers had dominated in LA and, as David Goldblatt writes in his book \"The Games\": \"The correlation between international prestige and Olympic achievement ... made the idea of a Japanese Olympics first plausible, then desirable and, finally, an essential element of foreign policy.\"Yasuji Myiazaki of Japan on his way to a gold medal in the 100m freestyle swimming event at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics.

(Photo by Keystone/Getty Images)Just as the 2020 Olympics were billed as the \"Recovery Olympics\" nine years after the Fukushima disaster, Nagata Hidejiro, the mayor of Tokyo, had first announced in 1930 a bid for the 1940 Games, envisioning the Olympics as a way of aiding the city's recovery from the earthquake of 1923, which had destroyed much of the metropolitan region. An Olympics in Tokyo in 1940 would also coincide with the 2,600th anniversary of Emperor Jimmu's mythical accession and the foundation of the nation. Goldblatt described it as the \"perfect notion around which to build support for a Japanese Olympics in an increasingly nationalist culture.\" The campaigning begins In the 1930s, Japan had Olympic pedigree. In 1912, it had become the first non-European/American country to participate in the Olympics and, significantly, also had delegates on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

(Photo by Kyodo News Stills via Getty Images)\"Japan had been agitating to hold the Games in the early 1930s,\" William Kelly, Sumitomo Professor of Japanese Studies at Yale University, tells CNN. Judo pioneer and IOC member Baron Jigoro Kano is widely believed to have played a major role in Japan's bid, giving a keynote speech to the IOC at the end of the 1932 Games.According to the IOC leader of the time, Henri de Baillet-Latour of Belgium, Kano told those in the room that holding the Games in Japan would extend the vision of the movement's founder, Pierre de Coubertin, and bridge the gap that existed between the East and the West. In this context, the 1940 Olympics was \"instrumental in legitimizing the IOC rhetoric that the Olympic movement was universal,\" writes Dr. Sandra Collins in her book \"The 1940 Tokyo Games: The Missing Olympics.\" While liberals had visions of a global festival, Japan's government saw the benefits of hosting the Olympics differently, as an opportunity to influence a world dominated by the west. In the first half of the century, the country was committed to maintaining and strengthening its position as its region's lead and during the Great Depression there was a growing belief that Japan would solve its economic problems through military conquests. But Tokyo was not guaranteed to win the race to host in 1940. Rome and Helsinki were the city's main rivals, with the Italian capital regarded the favorite. So in 1935, Japan's IOC member Sugimura Yataro traveled to Italy to visit the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini to ask Rome to withdraw its bid.\"In the you-scratch-my-back kind of deal that has become the norm in international sports politics, Mussolini announced with usual candour, 'We will waive our claim for 1940 in favour of Japan if Japan will support Italy's effort to get the XIII the Olympiad for Rome in 1944,\" writes Goldblatt. Benito Mussolini withdrew Rome's bid for the 1940 Games. The significance of 1936 BerlinDuring the conclusion of the 1936 Olympics, the Games that had been the Nazi power show, the IOC awarded 1940 to Tokyo, with the Japanese capital receiving 37 votes to Helsinki's 26. Four years after Nazi Germany had hosted the Olympics, Japan -- a country already regarded as an imperial aggressor -- was set to also have its time in the sporting limelight.

(Photo by The Asahi Shimbun via Getty Images)And in 1938, a year after Japan had invaded China, the IOC awarded the Winter Olympics to the Japanese city of Sapporo.But that same year, with major countries threatening to boycott as Japan's ferocious destruction of Chinese cities was reported in the American and European press, the Japanese government forfeited the right to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics.Embroiled in a war with China and knowing a global conflict was on the horizon, the military government passed the National Mobilization Act. \"Three months later, with little fanfare, the Japanese pleaded the need for 'the spiritual and material mobilization of Japan,' and relinquished the 1940 games,\" writes Goldblatt. \"The suspension can't be separated from the 1936 Olympics,\" reasons Kelly. \"The Americans, the British and French started talking about boycotting the 1940 Olympics because they felt they had been badly used by Hitler in staging this enormous propaganda Games so it was really the Berlin Olympics effect that caused the Japanese government to withdraw its bid. Japan knew it would be worse to put on the Games without the major powers.\"Naoto Tajima (Japan) competing in the triple jump at Berlin 1936  (Photo by ullstein bild/ullstein bild via Getty Images)The IOC proceeded to award the 1940 Games to Helsinki, but the Soviet Union's invasion of Finland in November 1939 ended any hope of holding an Olympics that year. Much like in 2020, the IOC held on in hope until succumbing to the inevitable. Kelly adds: \"The IOC said the world is increasingly at war but the Games will go on ... [but] bowed to the reality that Europe was in flames and so was the rest of the world and they canceled the games all together.\" The cost of canceling Tokyo's preparation for the 1940 Games had been \"quite considerable,\" says Kelly, with significant economic investment made on infrastructure projects, such as transportation, sanitation and the building of hotels. \"The local businesses that had been persuaded to invest heavily in facilities, in providing goods and services for the Games found themselves without a prospective customer base, so the business community was upset in Tokyo but this was at a time when you could not really express anger at the government,\" explains Kelly, arguing the country suffered more politically than economically in 1940.\"You're not able to use the largest mega event in the world in order to demonstrate to the rest of the world what a great country you are,\" he adds.

(Photo by The Asahi Shimbun via Getty Images)As the impact of postponing Tokyo 2020 is calculated, it's worth remembering that the Olympics in the 1920s and 1930s were a different animal to the billion-dollar movement we are familiar with today.David Wallechinsky, president of the International Society of Olympic Historians (ISOH), tells CNN Sport: \"There wasn't this huge emphasis that this is it, this is the Olympics.\"In '48 when the Games came back after 12 years people were just happy to have it happen at all. Of course, the introduction of the television, when people could watch it live, or at least follow a daily report, in the '60s, it was a whole other deal. \"By the time you got to 1968 you only had to follow what happened to the non-violent the protest of Tommie Smith and John Carlos to see that there was international interest in the Olympics.\"The futureWhenever an Olympics is held, there seems to be a crisis. In 2012 there were security issues, in 2016 it was the Zika virus. Now in 2020 it's the coronavirus.Last week, Japan's deputy prime minister even went as far as to tell a parliamentary committee last week that Tokyo 2020 was \"cursed,\" arguing that the Olympics is stopped by extraordinary world events every 40 years. Photo taken March 24, 2020, shows the flame for this year's Tokyo Olympics exhibited in Fukushima.  (Photo by Kyodo News via Getty Images)The Olympic movement has survived much: the boycotts of 1980 and 1984, the tragedies of Munich 1972 and Atlanta 1996, but in the last 100 years the world has not experienced something like the coronavirus pandemic.  \"We [the media], in the run up to the Olympics are always looking for the negative because that's a good story,\" says Wallechinsky.\"To tell people in 2012 that everything in London is going great, that's not a good story. Even the best organized Olympics, like Sydney in 2000, there's always these negative stories in advance and whenever I've spoken to people in organizing committees I've warned them about this -- it's not you, it's us -- but sometimes these warnings are real and in this case they are.\"",

        "content": "Moscow (CNN)Russian President Vladimir Putin has long provided other world leaders with a template for authoritarian rule. Now he faces a new test: Whether his top-down system can survive the coronavirus pandemic.In a televised address to the nation Wednesday, Putin announced a sweeping array of measures to cope with the spread of the virus and its widening economic effects.\"Let's not rely on our Russian luck,\" he said. \"Please do not think, as we often do: 'Oh, this will not touch me.' It can touch everyone. And then what is happening today in many Western countries, both in Europe and overseas, could become our immediate future.\"Why does Russia, population 146 million, have fewer coronavirus cases than Luxembourg?Some of the measures were meant to soften the economic blow. Starting on March 28, Russians will have a week's paid leave -- to stay home. Russians will see a moratorium on mortgage payments, and enterprises will be given credit holidays. And families entitled to government payments to support multiple children will receive extra monthly payments.But coronavirus has taken on a political dimension for the Russian leader: Putin also announced that a nationwide referendum on constitutional amendments scheduled for April 22 has been postponed until further notice.Read More\"We'll evaluate the situation and based only on the recommendations from doctors and specialists we will decide on a new date,\" Putin said.It's hard to understate how important that vote was to securing the Russian president's hold on power. Putin has grasped the reins of power in his country for two decades, but his current term ends in 2024, leaving Russia with a potential succession crisis. Putin's system of managed democracy means that power flows from one man: The president has no serious political competition, his friends and allies control the commanding heights of the economy and Putin is the ultimate arbiter of disputes between elites. The current constitution requires Putin to step down after his current term, meaning that the system he presides over could quickly unravel.Read more:Tracking coronavirus' global spreadWhy does Russia, population 146 million, have fewer coronavirus cases than Luxembourg?Why Putin would want Trump to win in 2020The April 22 vote was supposed to remedy that, in typically Putinesque fashion. The country's rubber-stamp parliament rammed through amendments to the constitution that could pave the way for the president stay in power after his current term ends, potentially until 2036. Putin signed the amendments, and the constitutional court endorsed the proposed changes, which must now be put to the popular vote.Coronavirus, then, is a new political battlefield for Putin, and the Kremlin leader preceded his speech Wednesday with a public relations offensive.Russian President Vladimir Putin visits a hospital in Kommunarka in protective gear.On Tuesday, the Russian leader paid a visit to the main Moscow hospital for monitoring suspected coronavirus patients, donning protective gear to visit the hospital in the city's suburb of Kommunarka. It was the kind of costume play we're used to seeing from the Kremlin, and reminiscent of one of his earliest moves as Russia's acting president: flying to the war-torn republic of Chechnya in 2000 in the co-pilot's seat of an Su-27 fighter jet.Putin cast the current campaign against coronavirus in martial terms.\"I watched how they [the hospital staff] are working, everyone is at their battle positions,\" he said, according to a Kremlin statement. \"Everyone works like clockwork, good and well-coordinated.\"Putin wasn't just playing the decisive commander-in-chief for a domestic audience. He also deployed his military as part of an international campaign to battle the pandemic. Over the weekend, the Russian military announced it was deploying a group of 100 doctors and virologists along with disinfection equipment to Italy to assist that country in countering the outbreak.Why Vladimir Putin is shaking up RussiaRussian Aerospace Forces Il-76 aircraft departed Sunday from Moscow's Chkalovsky military airfield with Russian military specialists and equipment aboard. The Russian Ministry of Defense posted a photo of one of the transport planes: the fuselage was decorated with a picture of two hearts, one each in the colors of the Italian and Russian flags.\"From Russia with love,\" the sign read in Russian, English and Italian. Russian state television has featured footage of Russian military vehicles barreling down the road in Italy, a NATO member state. It was a potent image, and the swift Russian deployment made the US and its allies look slow in responding to the crisis. According to a US defense official, the Russian move came amid a direct appeal by the Italian defense minister for US military aid in combating the coronavirus.\"Russia's Emergency Situations Ministry and Ministry of Defense love PR-laden gestures and they have excelled at that since the war in Syria began,\" said Andrew Weiss, Vice President for Studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"The reality is the underprovisioning of its [Russia's] domestic priorities and Russia sleepwalking into its Covid-19 response.\"Putin backs amendment that could see him run Russia until 2036To be sure, the Kremlin's PR-centered approach does not mean Russia can stop the spread of the virus. On Wednesday, the country's coronavirus headquarters reported the largest one-day increase in cases, rising to 658 from 495 the previous day.And in a Putin-centric system, all eyes are on the health of the leader. The Kremlin says Putin is healthy and working at his usual pace. But when describing the leader's health in a conference call, his spokesperson Dmitry Peskov often prefaces them by interjecting \"tfu! tfu! tfu!\" -- a superstitious utterance that's the equivalent of saying, \"knock on wood.\"Additional reporting by CNN's Mary Ilyushina in Moscow.",

The Prince of Wales is only displaying mild symptoms and is otherwise in good health, Clarence House said in a statement. It is unknown how the 71-year-old caught the virus because of his recent busy schedule of public events.The Queen, 93, remains in \"good health\" and is \"following all the appropriate advice with regard to her welfare,\" a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said Wednesday. Related storiesIs India prepared for a 21-day lockdown?White House, Senate reach historic $2 trillion stimulus dealTrack the spread of the coronavirusLive updates on the coronavirusThe monarch last saw Prince Charles briefly after an investiture ceremony for public awards at the palace in London on March 12. Charles has been advised he was contagious from March 13, a royal source told CNN. It is unclear why Prince Charles was advised he was not contagious earlier. The coronavirus incubation period -- the amount of time from exposure to symptoms -- is usually around five or six days, with a maximum of around 12 days, according to research published this month in the medical journal Annals of Internal Medicine.Read MoreAccording to a royal source, Prince Charles started showing symptoms last weekend, meaning he could have been exposed before he saw the Queen on March 12.He was tested on Monday and received the results on Tuesday, the source told CNN.Prince Charles's office at Clarence House has not responded to CNN's query regarding the timeline. \"It is not possible to ascertain from whom the Prince caught the virus owing to the high number of engagements he carried out in his public role during recent weeks,\" his office said earlier. Both Public Health England and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say there are indications people could be contagious before they show symptoms. While people are probably most contagious when they are symptomatic, scientists currently cannot pinpoint exactly when people can start spreading the disease.Following his last public event on March 12, Prince Charles has had a number of private meetings with individuals, all of whom have been made aware of the situation. He is self-isolating at his Scottish residence of Birkhall in Aberdeenshire, on the Queen's Balmoral estate, with a small number of staff keeping separate from him, the source added.  His wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, is self-isolating separately. She has been tested and does not have the virus, according to the statement from Clarence House. The tests were carried out by the National Health Service in Aberdeenshire, where the couple met the criteria required to be tested, the statement added.

The prince has a reputation for working hard, and meets more members of the public than virtually any other member of the royal family. His aides are now racing to determine how, when and where he contracted the virus, and with whom he may have had contact since. Despite the Queen being in her mid-90s, it is not known whether she has been tested. The source asked not to be named discussing the royal family's medical condition.Last week the palace said the Queen was canceling public events \"as a sensible precaution\" and that she and her husband, 98-year-old Prince Philip, moved to Windsor Castle on Thursday, a week earlier than planned. She is expected to stay there beyond the Easter period.     In a statement issued by the palace as they moved to Windsor, the Queen said the world was entering \"a period of great concern and uncertainty\" and warned that many would need to \"find new ways of staying in touch with each other and making sure that loved ones are safe.\" She said she and her family were ready to play their part.Prince Charles is the eldest child of the Queen and Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh. As someone over 70, he is considered to be at higher risk than average for coronavirus.Earlier this month, his office said he was not yet self-isolating because UK government and medical advice at the time were not advising over-70s to do so.On March 13, Prince Charles and his wife announced they were canceling their spring tour due to the escalating coronavirus pandemic. The pair had been set to visit Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cyprus and Jordan.CNN Health's Arman Azad contributed to this report.",

Australia and Canada then became the first countries to pull their athletes out of the competition, which led to a number of other nations doing the same.

The regional government said this was a \"temporary and extraordinary measure\" designed to \"lessen the pain of the families of the victims and the situation that's being recorded in Madrid's hospitals.\"Spain has the fourth highest number of confirmed cases worldwide -- after China, Italy and the US -- and the third highest number of deaths. The country has confirmed 39,673 cases and 2,696 deaths, the prime minister's office said Tuesday. Spain to extend coronavirus state of emergency as deaths soarThe Madrid municipal funeral service, a major provider in the city, announced in a statement on Monday it would stop collecting the bodies of Covid-19 victims, because its workers don't have sufficient protective material. The service manages 14 cemeteries, two funeral parlors and two crematoriums in Madrid.Read MoreThe funeral service said that cremations, burials and other services for coronavirus victims would continue as normal, but only if the bodies are \"sent by other funeral services businesses in a closed coffin.\"Madrid is one of the epicenters of the epidemics in Spain. The president of the Madrid region, Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso, said last week that the city expects 80% of its population to get Covid-19. \"They will have mild symptoms,\" she told a local radio, but added that the illness will be a problem for the city's vulnerable population, which is around 15% of people.Members of the Spanish army's military emergency unit disinfect the Palacio de Hielo.Spain has been locked down and in a state of emergency since Friday March 13. The period was initially expected to last 15 days, but Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Sunday that the state of emergency could be extended for further 14 days. The parliament will debate the motion on Wednesday.Emergency hospitals have been set up across the country, while residents have been ordered to stay indoors apart from for essential trips, and normally busy streets are deserted.A new government order has come into effect on Tuesday, ordering senior citizens homes to inform the government if they have any deceased people that they are unable to move out of the residence. The order appeared to be issued in reaction to reports in Spanish media that quoted the country's defense minister as saying that a care home for elderly citizens was found to have a body or bodies that weren't being moved out. CNN's Al Goodman, Laura Perez Maestro and Ingrid Formanek reported from Madrid. Max Ramsay reported from London, Ivana Kottasov\u00e1 wrote from London.",

She is built for adaptation.\"As Paralympic athletes this is our job,\" Weggemann told CNN Sport. \"We are constantly in a fight with our bodies and we are constantly finding ways to adapt.\"On January 21, 2008, Weggemann went to the hospital to receive an epidural injection -- her third -- to help treat back pain caused by postherpetic neuralgia. The injections were supposed to help with debilitating pain. Instead, they left her a paraplegic -- with complete loss of movement from her abdomen down. \"There is a piece of me that feels like this isn't that different from when I was paralyzed or when my arm injury happened,\" added Weggemann, referring to another debilitating setback in 2014 when she sustained permanent nerve damage to her left arm after a fall.

Right now I am controlling what I can control.\"READ: Japanese PM and IOC chief agree to postpone 2020 Olympics until 2021Mallory Weggemann of USA smiles at the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games.A competitive swimmer since the age of 7, Weggemann found herself back in pool only three months after her life-altering injury. In the four years that followed, she broke 34 American records, 15 world records and became a two-time Paralympic medalist at the London Paralympic Games in 2012, winning a gold and bronze medal. Most Paralympic athletes have stories like these. They are always credited for their ability to \"inspire.\" But in times like these, they are in a unique position to offer even more.\"Paralympians understand mental fortitude. For so many of us, our daily lives are ever-evolving,\" added Weggemann.\"That is part of our DNA. If you become a Paralympian, you have mastered that. You know how to handle an ever changing environment. For us, it's our bodies. Our impairments bring uncertainty and that's our normal.  \"From a training standpoint, many of us have been in situations like this before. Our daily fight is getting back to the point where we can perform the tasks needed to live and train.\"'Grieving process'Even so, Weggemann admits Tuesday's official announcement from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took its toll. The two sides agreed to push the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics back by a year.It's another devastating setback in a seven-year comeback she had been mounting since her last injury.\"It really is the best decision for the health and public safety of all. I think there will be a grieving process for many athletes,\" she added.\"While I am beyond grateful cancellation isn't on the table and that decisions are being made to keep everyone safe and healthy, it still brings a level of heartbreak.\"Weggemann says she is  \"constantly in a fight\" with her body.After the coronavirus brought the sports world to a full stop in what felt like a matter of days, the decision to move forward with the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo was the last, and by far the largest, looming question mark.IOC Thomas Bach offered a four-week timetable to make a decision, but pressure from national governing bodies and many individual athletes forced answers sooner rather than later. There is still much we don't know about this novel virus, including the possibility of another surge that could result from a global coming together of 11,000 athletes from across the world.For thousands of athletes like Mallory, it's another bump in an Olympic road that began long ago. The emotions are mixed. Key qualifying events had already been canceled across a variety of sports. The US Olympic and Paralympic training centers in Colorado Springs and Lake Placid had closed their doors last week for at least 30 days, leaving hundreds of athletes to find other options. Weggeman had to have equipment from a local gym donated to her garage. The recovery facilities which she depends on for recovery and the soft tissue work post workout also were shuttered.

I've been fighting for seven years to get back to this point.\"We got married after Rio and our entire future has been around planning for Tokyo,\" added Weggemman, who is married to Jeremy Synder. \"We've put having children on hold. We've put our entire lives on hold.\"Given her character, Weggemann is already searching for positives.\"Obviously, whatever Tokyo looks like, we are 100% committed. In a perfect world, I would have loved to see them still happen safely. The Olympics and Paralympics could be what we need to bring the world together again,\" she said.\"As athletes, we are all in the same boat. Every single one of us is in this together. We've all committed a lot to this dream.\"After her arm injury in 2014, Weggemann fought like crazy to make it to the Rio Games, only to walk away without a medal.She was pulled out of the water for a year and a half, while she underwent two major surgeries in 2017 to remove muscles from her arms.Every day while she was bedridden, she never lost sight of her dream for Tokyo. She's been fighting for another shot at the Paralympic podium since she first sat atop the one in London back in 2012.

She jumped around. And she took on a four-year battle for the right to wear the hijab while playing basketball, becoming one of the leading voices in the fight to get the International Federation of Basketball (FIBA) -- the sport's governing body -- to change its rules three years ago.With over 132,000 signatures on her change.org petition, Elbadawi urged FIBA to permanently lift the ban on headgear to allow players in turbans, hijabs and other religious headwear to play basketball at all levels.Elbadawi, who lives in Bradford in northern England, now plays with the hijab, having stayed true to herself, her religion and her passion for the sport. She's played for the University of Sunderland, Bradford Dragons and Bradford Cobras, but still faces criticism.\u00a0During the campaign, Elbadawi's love for sports was questioned as anti-hijab comments came her way. \"Why can't you just take off your hijab and play sports? If you love sports that much, just take it off,\" the Muslim activist explained.Read More\"Girls don't do that\" Born in Sudan, Elbadawi moved to the UK with her family when she was aged one and it was while living Bradford that she came to love sport -- trying anything that involved a ball.It was only later she realized life would have been very different had she stayed in her homeland.\"In the first few years when I went to Sudan, I saw boys playing football, so I joined and I remember one of my cousins came over and pulled me to the side,\" Elbadawi, who started to regularly visit Sudan at the age of 11, told CNN Sport.Elbadawi's cousin told her: \"Girls don't do that here.\" In light of that and leading a successful basketball career, the activist wants to encourage more women -- especially Muslim women -- to participate in sports. Key for Elbadawi is the power of conversation.\"If they don't have the conversation to start off with, then they won't know where their family are with it,\" said Elbadawi, who herself feared her family's reaction to her love of sport. \"When I spoke to my parents, my dad was so open to it,\" said Elbadawi, who last year was named Rising Athlete of the Year at the British Muslim Awards.However, she is well aware that much work needs to be done within her community, pointing to the often-used Arabic phrase \"el benet ma btetnatnat\" -- \"the girl does not jump around.\"It is a phrase which suggests that women should not be put in social situations where their bodies are exposed to fast movement. It's a phrase that was instilled in Elbadawi's upbringing.\"You'd barely see me in any kind of makeup and I just wore lots of hoodies to hide my body.\" Playing in a man's world\"I felt like the meaning of strong for me was to be masculine and get the job done without feeling anything,\" said Elbadawi, who is also a poet.The young Elbadawi was used to holding in her emotions. Bullied at school, she would wait until she was at home before letting her feelings out. \"Eventually, I realized that doesn't work for me,\" she added.In her most recognized poem 'Boys will be Boys,' she writes: \"Society teaches boys from a young age to mask the fragility with toughness.\"In 2017, research by The Conversation showed that the notion of acting tough and hiding weakness had become a form of pressure for young men aged 18 to 30.

Even though over six million users on Instagram hashtag their posts with hijabi, Elbadawi explained how the word has come to undermine identification. \"It almost takes away from my skills as a person. We don't say hijab doctor,\" said Elbadawi, who spent the beginning of her career playing  without wearing the hijab until her perception was changed at university. She added: \"I felt by not wearing the hijab at the time, it allowed me to actually be me without having to defend a whole religion.\"I saw a girl who came to play versus our university -- she was wearing the hijab. I saw myself in her and thought, I could do that one day.\" She calls herself the \"Queen of the Ball\" and depicted this idea that a woman can be both beautiful and bold at her ballgame. Many women athletes, including Elbadawi, struggle to embrace their feminine figure.\"It's kind of a combination of balls -- the ones where you can go to, wear a big gown and look beautiful as a woman and at the same time, ball as in any kind of ballgame. For me, that's a celebration of being a woman.\"",

The brothers started with the Marble Sand Rally and after that went viral they invented the Marblympics -- which is now called the Marble League after a run-in with the International Olympic Committee.The Marble League is an annual tradition that consists of 16 events where 16 different marble teams compete against each other.The teams have different colors and individual identities with their own fanbases.Teams include the Green Ducks, the O'Rangers and the Raspberry Racers.The league has a vibrant community page on Reddit where fans post memes, videos and support their favorite team.Jelle sets up and tests a water event for the 2019 Marble League.But is marble racing is a sport?\"It's pretty serious now,\" says Dion as he launches into an impassioned defense of marble racing. \"People see it and experience it like a sport, a real sport.\"It's blown my mind, people see it like that.\"He could be right; last year the Marble League was featured on ESPN8: The Ocho, a 24-hour takeover of ESPN2 inspired by 2004 film \"Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story\" that showcases \"seldom seen sports.\" It also featured again in this year's takeover.In the past, JMR has even worked with a betting company that livestreamed races with viewers able to bet on the outcome in real-time.JMR construct stands for the marble fans to watch the Marble League and cheer on teams as part of the excitement of videos.Dion believes that there's been an upsurge in interest as people have found solace in the sport amid the coronavirus pandemic.\"It's sucking you into another world free of war and everything in the human dimension, I think that's the magic of it,\" he says.\"It brings relief. I have a lot of messages and DMs from fans who thank us for the videos and what we do right now for them.\"In the past week, the YouTube channel has received 3.8 million views and gained over 78,000 new subscribers.During the same period, the channel's Twitter following doubled and Instagram following tripled.The central trio that makes up Jelle's Marble Races (left to right: Dion Bakker, Jelle Bakker and Anton Weber)The genesis of this marble racing series began over 30 years ago in the backyard of the brothers' grandfather's house.\"Jelle built the marble runs and I started helping,\" Dion explains. \"It was when he was four. Most people with autism have a preoccupation, one thing they only want to repeat and that was one of his [Jelle's] activities.\"In a 2016 interview with VICE, Jelle said his form of autism means he is \"really interested in moving things, sounds, lights, etc\" and that building marble runs and racing marbles plays into this perfectly.Jelle has also constructed a Marblopolis amusement park at his marble museum and workshop.Fast forward to 2020 and Jelle is doing this full-time alongside commentator Greg Woods, who is from the US. Meanwhile Anton Weber from Germany -- known to the community as Mellacus -- is the full-time PR and community manager, which he does alongside his duties as president of the Jelle's Marble Runs Committee (JMRC).The JMRC is made up of collaborators and fans from all over the world.The channel also has a composer from Greece and a designer from Belgium.\"It's a decision we made to have people from everywhere,\" Dion says.\"It's nice, it's cool, it's fun to have contact and communicate with people from all over the world.\"         View this post on Instagram           Watching party in Sweden: A last ode to the name of the event that can't be named.

That would be very cool.\"",

Her usual training center at the University of Arkansas is closed amid the coronavirus outbreak, leaving Morris, a pole vault silver medalist from the last Olympics, with a big decision -- stay at home and build fitness by running in the local neighborhood, or pack up and drive 14 hours to a training group in Atlanta. The situation is hardly ideal but has been made easier as Morris now has the company of husband Tyrone Smith, a Bermudian long jumper who has joined her from Texas after his business school lectures moved online. \"Like all athletes we're kind of at a loss,\" Morris tells CNN Sport. Sandi Morris poses with her silver medal at the World Athletics Championships last year.\"It's either risk your own health and drive across the country and go join another small training group in a private facility, or do we wait it out and see if the facilities open back up in four weeks?

'Be ready for anything'With the goalposts continually shifting and preparation hindered without access to facilities, coaches and training partners, athletes have been left in limbo. \"I'm going to use it in a positive way,\" says Morris, who is trying to remain optimistic. \"I've had a couple of little nagging injuries that normally I would say: I'm going to push through this and do physical therapy while training. \"But now I have more time. I'm going to focus on physical therapy over the next week or so, then go back to the general conditioning and try to get some base work in because now we don't know how long this season's going to be. \"Is it going to be postponed?

Put the phone down, don't overthink anything.\"On Sunday, IOC president Thomas Bach wrote a letter to athletes announcing it was the organizer's \"leading principle to safeguard the health of everyone involved, and to contribute to containing the virus.\"Bach acknowledged the difficulties athletes have had in preparing for these Games, reiterated that cancellation was not considered an option, and said that a final decision would be made within the next four weeks.'Ton of anxiety'For Morris' partner Smith, an Olympic veteran who is getting ready for his fourth Games, the scheduling of Tokyo 2020 is perhaps more pressing -- it could determine when and how he calls time on his career.  \"I could conceivably train through (to next year) but time's not on my side,\" the 35-year-old tells CNN Sport. \"It's increasingly difficult to train while being at school (in Texas) and being away from my coach and everything that I'm familiar with. \"It has definitely crossed my mind. I think especially if there was a two-year postponement, it would mean that my career was over when I didn't even realize it. I'd have had my last track meet this past summer.\"Smith competes in the long jump final of the 2018 Commonwealth Games on Australia's Gold Coast.The USA's Track and Field and Swimming bodies both called for the Games to be postponed last week, while four-time Olympic gold medalist and IOC member Hayley Wickenheiser has urged Olympic organizers not to be \"insensitive and irresponsible\" by saying with certainty that the Games will go ahead as planned. Wickenheiser is now in her final year of medical school and has been on the frontline of emergency rooms in Toronto while hospitals try and cope with the pandemic. Having played in six Olympics, the former ice hockey star is an attested voice in this debate. \"I have lived through this uncertainty as an athlete, it's very unsettling,\" Wickenheiser tells CNN Sport. \"There's a ton of anxiety. There are athletes that will do just fine with this and they will carry on and not miss a beat and there are other athletes that will be crippled by the uncertainty and anxiety, that's how general human reactions will be.\"Wickenheiser celebrates victory over the United States at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.'The world is hurting'With firsthand experience of how hospitals are coping with the virus, Wickenheiser knows the importance of not losing sight of the bigger picture -- and to couch whatever may happen with the Games in the wider context of public health.\"It just is very difficult to be talking about how to protect athletes in the Olympic Village when so many countries in the world are facing this pandemic head on,\" she says.\"Where I come from is a place where I think our tone has to be a little more empathetic.\"I watched my supervising doctors be stressed going in to see COVID patients ... I've seen people in the ICU on respirators that are not actually that old. This is very real and it doesn't scare necessarily everyone. We all have to take a responsibility.

The difficulty, he says, is that when you've spent four years of your life building towards an event, the prospect of not taking part in it can be tough to swallow.  \"I don't want to be selfish, but so much of what we do to be Olympians and to be at the pinnacle of sport requires selfishness. It's hard to break completely out of that mindset,\" he says. \"I understand the world is hurting right now and there are things more important. But there's not many things that are more important to me as an individual. That's what I'm struggling with.\"For now, athletes are left playing a waiting game with little option but to train for the Olympics as best they can.

        "content": "London (CNN)As the novel coronavirus rips through a stunned global population, it's becoming clear that no one can escape the impact it's having on society.The past few weeks have shown that even the world's wealthiest and most powerful are as likely to contract the virus as anyone else. However, less attention is being paid to the most vulnerable members of society -- those in poverty, people living on the breadline and the homeless.  The problem reached a crunch point in the UK, which has dramatically increased its response to the virus outbreak this week. Food banks that provide a lifeline for some of the estimated 14 million in poverty are running low on volunteers, many of whom have been forced to self-isolate, as well as food itself, which is in short supply following panic-buying.  Read more:Coronavirus is revealing how badly the UK has failed its most vulnerableUK government will pay 80% of wages as it closes pubs to fight coronavirusLondon amid coronavirus: Empty shelves but busy barsUS, UK strategies shifted following UK epidemiologists' ominous reportThe situation is equally bleak for the UK's homeless population, estimated to be around 320,000. Unable to follow government advice to self-isolate, they face a double blow as life-saving services close just as they become most needed.People working on the frontline in homeless shelters told CNN their worst nightmares were already coming true, with at least one facility forced to close after one of its users died from COVID-19. Most of the people in that shelter are now sleeping rough and may have come into contact with virus carriers.Read MoreHomeless people hold signs appealing for help as they pose for a photograph in London on March 19.Shelter, a non-profit that provides support for the UK's homeless population, estimates that the number of people sleeping on the streets has risen 165% since 2010.That date is important. It's the year the UK went from having a center-left Labour government to a center-right Conservative-led administration. And in the wake of the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, it embarked on policies that radically cut state spending. \"The message was clear...  we need to cut back to balance the books,\" says Garry Lemon, director of policy at the Trussell Trust, a non-profit that supports food banks in the UK. How grocery stores restock shelves in the age of coronavirus\"It took a lot of forms, but billions of pounds were taken out of our social security system -- and it was done with widespread public support.\"Critics believe that government policies over the past decade have left the social security system severely compromised. \"Our research shows that combined impact of those policies amount to average \u00a33,000 a year ($3,560)  for the poorest,\" says Clare McNeil from the left-of-center IPPR think tank.Lemon adds that his organization's research has shown a link between these policies and a rise in \"homelessness and food bank usage.\"The subject of food banks is a good place to return to coronavirus, and especially how it affects the vulnerable. \"The majority of our volunteers are retired. Some are not in good health because it's hard to be when you're over 70,\" says Allison, one of seven volunteers at an independent food bank in the UK. (She preferred to withhold her last name in order to be able to speak more freely.)\"We've given them the option of dropping out and obeying the government guidelines. But it does leave a hole. Now, if a family member coughs, people are gone at the drop of a hat.\"JUST WATCHEDActs of kindness amid coronavirus pandemic ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHActs of kindness amid coronavirus pandemic  01:58Lemon points out that this is far from the only problem faced by food banks. \"With businesses closing down and the social security state as it is, we face a possible increase in demand. We also face a responsibility of maintaining our supply of food.\"Panic buying has left shelves empty across the UK, forcing supermarkets to ration the amount individuals can buy.  For small food banks like Allison's, it's a real concern. \"Panic buying has meant supermarkets are limiting so people cannot buy excess items for donating. People who use the food bank, it's quite a hand-to-mouth existence. And now that food just isn't there.\"A ready supply of volunteers and food is one issue. Arguably, a more serious issue is the physical condition of the people who depend on them. \"People with mental health problems, single mothers, disabled people ... these people are all overrepresented in food banks,\" says Lemon.Dr. Onkar Sahota, a member of the London Assembly and a family doctor in Britain's National Health Service, says that \"those in poverty are exposed because, in many cases, their underlying health will not be as good as wealthier members of the population.\" In the context of coronavirus, he says \"their immune systems might be lower because they have less access to foods and find it harder to maintain a healthy lifestyle.\"Sahota goes on to explain that in some cases, the most vulnerable \"will find it harder to self-isolate -- especially in the case of homeless people.\"Matt Downie, director of policy for Crisis, a charity on the frontline of homelessness in Britain, explains: \"If you are in a night shelter, you are in a shared space, possibly sleeping next to other people on the floor, where you have to share washing facilities. The advice the government is giving to self-isolate and keep yourself clean is useless for people in that situation.\"You are three times more likely to have severe respiratory problems if you are homeless and the average age of death if you are homeless is 44,\" he adds.McNeil believes the UK's homelessness crisis has been exacerbated by austerity measures. \"Homeless people have been affected because of the reduction in funding for local authorities, so local support had to close down,\" she says.Anecdotally, this seems to be the case, according to Downie. \"In some areas, people have been told by their local councils that there is no help available.\" In the context of coronavirus, the combination of an increased demand for services and, as with food banks, a hit on the volunteer network has created a nightmare scenario.And in a stark reminder of how serious this situation is, Downie adds: \"If there is a report of an outbreak in a shelter then obviously it will have to shut, meaning we will see more people sleeping rough.\"The challenges facing these vulnerable members of society are nothing new. Campaigners hope that this crisis will at least shine a light on the plight of those in poverty and without homes. \"This coronavirus exposes the cracks in society -- those who have mortgages and regular income could suddenly find themselves facing the same problems as people who are on benefits,\" says Sahota.McNeil points out that people who are used to enjoying a secure income might find themselves relying on the state. And she thinks that the government might have to make these benefits more generous, given the sudden influx of people who are used to a certain way of living.The UK is closing schools to all except the children of 'key workers.' Here's who they are\"People on average incomes, who suddenly find themselves in a position of needing social security, couldn't conceive on living on under \u00a3100 a week,\" she says. Which would, of course, put enormous pressure on the government to boost spending on the welfare state, 10 years after government policy was to cut back.All of which brings us back to the politics of this. At some point, this crisis will abate. And when that happens, we will be living in a new normal. The current Conservative government will have had to subsidize businesses and individuals. Sahota believes it will have proved that \"austerity was a political decision, rather than that we had no choice.\"It might be that when all is said and done, previously comfortable people, suddenly forced to stare into the eyes of destitution, will agree with Sahota and be unable to accept that economic prudence is more important than looking after the livelihoods of fellow citizens.This outbreak will change many things, and it's not clear how many of those will be undone when it's all over. Just how the world moves on from this is still anyone's guess. But, if current projections are right, we in the West are still only in the early stages of this thing.",

Luxembourg, by contrast, has a population of just 628,000, according to the CIA World Factbook, and by Saturday had reported 670 coronavirus cases with eight deaths.Russia's early response measures -- such as shutting down its 2,600-mile border with China as early as January 30, and setting up quarantine zones -- may have contributed to the delay of a full-blown outbreak, some experts say.Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to criticism over the number of recorded cases.A strong record on testingRead More\"The director-general of WHO said 'test, test, test,'\" Dr. Melita Vujnovic, the World Health Organization's representative in Russia, told CNN Thursday. \"Well, Russia started that literally at the end of January.\"Vujnovic said Russia also took a broader set of measures in addition to testing.\"Testing and identification of cases, tracing contacts, isolation, these are all measures that WHO proposes and recommends, and they were in place all the time,\" she said. \"And the social distancing is the second component that really also started relatively early.\"Rospotrebnadzor, Russia's state consumer watchdog, said Saturday that it had run more than 156,000 coronavirus tests in total. By comparison, according to CDC figures, the United States only picked up the pace in testing at the beginning of March, while Russia says it has been testing en masse since early February, including in airports, focusing on travelers from Iran, China, and South Korea. That's not to say there were no holes in Russia's defenses. Russia didn't start testing those arriving from Italy or other badly affected EU countries immediately, limiting its controls for arrivals from Europe to taking temperatures and imposing two-week quarantines. The majority of the coronavirus cases reported in Russia were brought from Italy, according to health officials.  Distrust among the populationPeople have still been crowding the Moscow metro system.Still, Russia contends with widespread public skepticism, a legacy of its Soviet past. On social media, Russians have raised questions referring to their country's poor track record of transparency, such as the coverup around the Chernobyl nuclear catastrophe in 1986 and the country's botched response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the 1980s.Putin and Xi are using the coronavirus crisis to extend their control. Across the world, Trump struggles to keep upAuthorities have moved swiftly to counter what they see as misinformation. In early March, Russia's Federal Security Service and internet watchdog moved to take down a viral post claiming the real number of coronavirus cases was 20,000 and that the Russian government was covering it up. Facebook and Instagram users in Russia then started to see coronavirus awareness alerts linking to Rospotrebnadzor's official website.  News reports of shortages in protective equipment have also fueled skepticism. And some experts have raised doubts about the reliability of Russia's testing system, which depends on a single laboratory. A report by PCR.News, a media outlet for medics and healthcare professionals, pointed out that the only approved coronavirus testing system, produced by Vector in Novosibirsk, has a lower sensitivity than other virus tests, raising concerns about false negatives.David Berov, the first confirmed coronavirus patient in Moscow, wrote on Instagram that his second test showed a negative result, while the first and third tested positive for coronavirus.\"The virus was confirmed in my third test, it was not seen in my blood but was in my saliva,\" Berov wrote on March 5. \"As I was told, they could barely see it so that's why they were in doubt for so long.\"Vector did not respond to a request for comment. The Russian branch of the WHO, however, told CNN it received the specifications for the Vector test kits and the laboratory had been placed on the list of approved institutions used to confirm the coronavirus.Cover-up allegations rebutted by Kremlin and the WHOPutin has put together a coronavirus information center in Moscow, pictured here.Anastasia Vasilyeva, a doctor for Russian opposition figure Alexey Navalny and leader of the Alliance of Doctors union, made headlines with a series of videos in which she claims the authorities are covering up real coronavirus numbers by using pneumonia and acute respiratory infection as a diagnosis. \"You see they said the first coronavirus patient that died, that the cause of death was thrombosis,\" Vasilyeva told CNN. \"That's obvious, nobody dies from coronavirus itself, they die from the complications, so it's very easy to manipulate this.\"EU says pro-Kremlin media trying to sow 'panic and fear' with coronavirus disinformationMoscow health officials denied the accusation and said they were testing pneumonia patients for coronavirus. The WHO's Dr. Vujnovic also was skeptical about Vasilyeva's claim. \"If there was a hidden, unrecognized burden somewhere it would be seen in these [pneumonia] reports,\" she said. \"So I do not believe this is happening, which does not say that you might not see an increase of cases in the next period, because we have seen that in many countries.\"Putin himself addressed the concerns about the statistics Wednesday, saying the government might not have the full picture but is not covering up the numbers.\"Here is the thing: the authorities may not possess the full information, because people a) sometimes do not report it, b) they themselves don't know that they are sick, and the latent period is very long,\" he said in a televised meeting. \"But everything that is issued ... by the Ministry of Health is all objective information.\"This week the numbers have surged, with Russia adding 30 to 50 cases every day, and the count will most likely continue its upward trajectory as Russia expands its testing. Nevertheless, the local representative for the WHO says Russia is still doing relatively well, as the country tracks cases with epidemiological links to travel or family transmission. On Saturday morning, Rospotrebnadzor released a figure potentially more concerning than the number of confirmed cases -- 36,540 people are being monitored for possible coronavirus. Meanwhile, the government moved to impose more sweeping measures, canceling public events and closing Russia's borders to foreigners, with some exceptions. But politics as usual continues under Putin: the President has signed a decree scheduling a nationwide referendum on constitutional amendments that could see him stay in power till 2036 on April 22. The authorities have vowed to monitor coronavirus developments but so far have not changed the date.",

Manchester United and Manchester City -- who both play in the Premier League -- announced on Saturday that they are donating a combined $117,000 (\u00a3100,000) to help food banks in the Greater Manchester area. Food banks have been facing increased demand because of the spread of the disease. And the \"City United\" scheme hopes to alleviate some of those strains. Serena Williams says social distancing has put her 'on edge'\"We are proud of the role our supporters play in helping local food banks and recognise the increased strain likely to be placed on these charities by the impact of coronavirus,\" the clubs said in a joint statement. \"At a time of challenge for our community, we are pleased to come together with our fans to help vulnerable members of society in a City United.\"Read MoreThe food banks in the Manchester area usually collect a large proportion of their donations on match days for Manchester City and Manchester United. But that source of donations -- collected by MCFC Fans Foodbank Support outside of Manchester City's Etihad Stadium and MUFC Fans Foodbank outside Manchester United's Old Trafford -- was cut dry after all professional football in England was postponed until at least April 30, with the current season extended indefinitely.So following a joint project between the MCFC and MUFC Fans' Foodbanks, it was announced each club will donate \u00a350,000 to the Trussell Trust.A poster of the joint venture. The Trust supports a network of over 1,200 food bank centers, including 19 in the Greater Manchester area.\"As the coronavirus pandemic develops, more people than ever may need help from food banks across our network,\" The Trussell Trust's Senior Operations Manager Rachel Macklin said. \"This situation presents a huge additional pressure on already overstretched resources. We may start to see a reduction in food donations and volunteers may become unavailable if they are in the at-risk categories or are self-isolating. \"We're working closely with our network to understand each food bank's situation, offer guidance, and work out how we can best support them. We know we won't be able to do this alone, so we are truly grateful for the support.\"Globally, more than 272,000 people have contracted the virus and at least 11,310 have died, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.READ: Brazilian soccer stars wear face masks in protest at playing match amid coronavirus pandemicManchester United and Manchester City players clash during their Premier League match.Elsewhere in the leagueOutside of Manchester, Premier League clubs around the country have been doing their bit to help people cope during these turbulent times.

Desperate scenes have unfolded in the north of the country, particularly the hard-hit Lombardy region where infections first exploded last month, as hospitals struggle to treat thousands of cases. And Chinese medical experts helping Italy deal with the crisis have said the restrictions imposed in Lombardy are \"not strict enough.\"The government has now agreed that the military can be used to help enforce the lockdown, the president of the Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, told a news conference on Friday.\"(The request to use the army) has been accepted... and 114 soldiers will be on the ground throughout Lombardy... it is still too little, but it is positive,\" Fontana said. \"Unfortunately we are not seeing a change of trend in the numbers, which are rising.\"Read MoreThe soldiers had until now been deployed in the region to ensure general security in the streets.Related storiesCalifornia orders residents to stay homeItaly hermit's insight on self-isolationOpinion: Why Italy has higher death tollLive updates on the coronavirusMore than 4,000 people have now died from the disease in Italy, the country's civil protection agency said Friday -- more than any other nation -- and nearly 6,000 new infections were confirmed in the past day, bringing the total to more than 47,000 cases.  Daniela Confalonieri, an Italian nurse in Milan, the region's capital, said the situation was so dire that the dead were no longer being counted.\"We're working in a state of very high stress and tension,\" Confalonieri told Reuters. \"Unfortunately we can't contain the situation in Lombardy, there's a high level of contagion and we're not even counting the dead any more. \"Look at the news that's coming out of Italy and take note of what the situation really is like. It's unimaginable.\"A hospital doctor in Bergamo, another Lombardy city, told CNN it had been hit so hard by the coronavirus that it is now sending patients who need intensive care to other parts of the country.\"Bergamo is sending ICU patients to other regions because we ran out (of space),\" Dr. Stefano Magnone told CNN on Friday, adding that intensive care units in hospitals in nearby Brescia were also full. Brescia is the second-worst affected province, according to the civil protection agency.Italian doctors hope for a sign the coronavirus lockdown is working, because there's no plan B\"Around 50 patients were sent out of Lombardy to other regions, mainly in the south,\" Magnone said. Less than half of those were Covid-19 cases, according to the civil protection agency.Bergamo's mayor on Thursday announced plans to build a field hospital in the city to help manage the situation.A doctor in the Lombardy city of Cremona, Romano Paolucci, told Reuters that he had \"seen a lot of dead here\" and that medical staff were battling to cope with a lack of equipment, long hours and increasing sickness within their own ranks.\"I would say that we are at the end of our strength,\" he said. \"This is a small hospital and we are taking in a lot of people, I would say the capacity is finished.\"We do not have sufficient resources and especially staff because apart from everything else now the staff are beginning to get sick.\"About 70% of those treated at the hospital for Covid-19 are surviving, he added.

        "content": "Tokyo (CNN)The Olympic flame arrived in Japan on Friday, marking the beginning of official celebrations for a global sporting event that could still be derailed by the novel coronavirus pandemic.Sporting groups from the National Basketball Association (NBA) to the European Championships and Formula 1 have canceled events to avoid large congregations of international spectators and athletes in recent weeks. But Japan insists that Tokyo 2020 will happen.  The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said Wednesday it is \"fully committed\" to holding the games from July 24 and that measures were being taken to guarantee the \"safety and interests of athletes, coaches and support teams.\"  The nation of 125 million people has 1,662 confirmed cases of the virus, according to the country's Ministry of Health. Experts have warned, however, that Japan's low testing rate could be masking a higher number of infections. US President Donald Trump said Thursday that G7 leaders had discussed postponing or canceling the Olympics this week, but that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe \"has not made a decision.\" Read MoreOn Monday, Abe said he had secured the backing of G7 leaders to hold the Olympics in their \"complete form.\"  He did not comment when asked if there could be a delay.   People wearing face masks chat next to the Olympic Rings on March 13, 2020 in Tokyo, Japan. Ultimately, it might not be down to Japan. The IOC can decide to call off the Games as late as May.   Japan Olympic Committee member Kaori Yamaguchi broke ranks on Friday, saying the Games should be postponed because some athletes had been unable to train. \"The Olympics should not be held in a situation people in the world can't enjoy,\" the 1988 Olympics judo bronze medalist told the Nikkei newspaper.Earlier, Shigeru Ishiba, a member of Japan's ruling LDP party, warned that even if Japan manages to contain the virus at home, athletes and spectators may be coming from countries where the virus is still spreading.   \"It's possible that the Olympic Games will be canceled despite Japan's best efforts,\" Ishiba said.    Canceling the GamesThough the 1916 Summer Olympics were canceled due to the onset of WWI, and both the Summer Olympics of 1940 and 1944 were axed due to WWII, scrapping an Olympics in peacetime would be unprecedented.  Doing so would have ramifications on everything and everyone from the sponsors and broadcasters to the economy and athletes.Organizers said in December that the cost of hosting the Olympics was 1.35 trillion yen ($12.35 billion) -- and, according to Reuters, that figure did not include the cost of moving the marathon and walking events from Tokyo to Sapporo to avoid the summer heat, a decision taken in October 2019.  JUST WATCHEDJapanese government under scrutiny for handling of coronavirusReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHJapanese government under scrutiny for handling of coronavirus 03:20Massive investments had been made in improving Japan's transportation networks, building venues and upgrading tourism facilities in anticipation of the 90 million visitors that Abe said Japan would welcome in 2020.\"They were thinking the Olympics could act as a backdrop for Japan that would broadcast to literally billions of people all around the world,\" said Keith Henry, the president of Asia strategy, a public policy advisory group based in Japan. It's not just the capital that would take a hit from a possible cancellation or delay.\"The aim was for visitors to spend a few days in Tokyo, then take the opportunity to explore other regions of Japan,\" said Henry. \"The economic damage will be widespread across Japan.\"Matheson said cities outside Tokyo were expected to receive 100,000 international tourists from the Games, who would pay higher room rental rates than tourists normally do at that time of year. \"That's potentially at least hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions, in lost revenue for the hospitality industry, and that's probably not insurable,\" he added.  Delaying the Games Postponing the Games by a few months has been floated as an option -- but there are doubts this is feasible.A pedestrian wearing a face mask walks past a display with an illustration of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games mascot character Miraitowa on February 26, 2020 in Tokyo, Japan. TV rights holders, for one, might be unhappy with having to schedule the Olympics during the NFL season in the US, which runs between September 10, 2020 and January 3, 2021, and the European soccer season, which was postponed and is now scheduled from 11 June to 11 July 2021. Ishiba agreed with this reasoning, and said any postponement and rescheduling would have to happen well before the start of the Paris Olympics in 2024. \"Many say this and that for options. But nobody has the answers,\" he said.JUST WATCHEDExperts call for more testing as coronavirus worsensReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHExperts call for more testing as coronavirus worsens 03:05Earlier in March, Japan's Olympics minister Seiko Hashimoto said that Tokyo's contract with the IOC did allow it to postpone the games until the end of the year.But postponing the Games would also ramp up the cost by billions of dollars, according to Victor Matheson, a sports economist at the College of the Holy Cross -- and waste money already spent by Japan's government, advertisers, sponsors and media outlets in the run up to Tokyo 2020. Games with no spectatorsOne alternative would be to hold the Games as planned without spectators. That way sponsors, athletes and TV rights holders still have an Olympics, said Matheson.\"You still get to keep your $3-4 billion of TV rights. The athletes are still on the world stage and you get to keep the majority of your sponsorship money,\" said Matheson. \"It keeps a lot of your revenue intact and there's no scheduling issues.\"  Hosting the Olympics is a source of national pride for Japan and this option would allow the country to save face.JUST WATCHEDJapan cancels cherry blossom festivals over virus fearsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHJapan cancels cherry blossom festivals over virus fears 02:41The Games have been billed as a \"recovery Olympics\" to highlight the recovery of those areas devastated by the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and disaster, which killed nearly 20,000 people and left over 2,500 others missing.  The Olympic torch relay, for example, begins in Fukushima on March 23, to shine a spotlight on the area hardest hit by the nuclear meltdown, before passing through Japan's 47 prefectures until it arrives in Tokyo for the opening of the Olympics on July 24.This option, however, would clearly lose Japan billions of dollars in tourist revenue. What about the athletes?For many athletes, competing at the Olympics is a career-defining moment which requires years of training and personal sacrifice. Peak physical fitness often comes in a person's 20s and early 30s, meaning athletes have a small window of opportunity to win a medal. The scrapping of Tokyo 2020 could be life-altering.Some athletes have yet to qualify. Those needing to improve their rankings could miss out because many qualification events have been rescheduled. Baseball's final qualifying event, for example, scheduled to take place in Taiwan, has been moved from April to June. The \"flame of recovery tour\" will be taking the Olympic flame firstly to the parts of Japan most affected by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. As the Olympic flame begins its journey across Japan, many still hope the country will be able to pull off a safe Games. However, the outcome remains as uncertain as the future of the virus. \"In some ways there's a dark cloud over the whole world and Japan is a part of that,\" said Henry.  \"So where ever that torch goes it is not going to necessarily be a happy occasion.\"You have thousands of athletes preparing for an event that they're not sure is going to take place or not. So, there's a lot of anxiety around the Olympics -- and probably rightly so.\" CNN's Aimee Lewis, Junko Ogura, Kaori Enjoji, Aleks Klosok, Sharif Paget contributed to this report.",

London: A city that should be emptying, but where instead sidewalks and stores are crammed, and metro stations are closed. Rumors swirling of a 15-day lockdown mean nearly everyone you talk to is out panic-buying something, even if the government tries to insist \"lockdown\" is the wrong word.The changing advice and the lack of widespread testing leave the collective impression here that it is either too late to stop what is happening, or something, inescapable and mammoth, is looming. This densely packed city of over 9 million simply can't make up its mind. Some shelves are empty, but some bars full.\"It looks as though London is now a few weeks ahead\" of the rest of the country in the virus spread, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said out of nowhere on Monday. And given that the UK is meant to be a few weeks behind Italy, that gave the impression that collapse was imminent.

The idea of \"herd immunity\" -- of letting enough people catch the virus to mean our population is immune enough not to support it in the future -- seemed smart. Smart in that very British post-colonial, Brexit way of thinking you are smarter than pretty much all other countries, based on the solid hunch of a few clever people, and some confidence.A newspaper headline warns of the potential of further measures to fight the coronavirus in London.Was the sudden lurch Wednesday to school closures on Friday, and possible lockdowns in the city at the weekend, informed purely by new modeling based on fresh data about the virus' appalling severity from Italy? Or was it answering a chorus of criticism that Britain was going too much alone, in keeping the country open as usual?As early as a week ago, my local store was crammed by 10 a.m., with shoppers walking past aisles of fresh produce, and instead electing to buy all the pasta, soap, bleach and toilet paper, as though guided by a future apocalypse that had yet to stop fish being delivered daily.My barber said he will stay open \"until they tell him to shut.\" The butcher remarked how \"lovely and quiet\" the skies were without planes, as he dumped twenty chicken breasts into my bag, before taking a call from a wholesaler whose prices had gone up again. Just near Holloway Road, on Thursday, an entire car's fender and number plate had been left on the side of the road, a harbinger perhaps of how great a chaos one driver felt we were sliding in to. The fender of a car, just left on a street, seems to be a symbol of the times. CNN blurred the license plate.The UK's free health service NHS -- always the underfunded and adored hero of a country unable to appreciate how much basic medicine costs elsewhere -- has been caught in the headlights. Changing centralized advice has also not helped. A friend said she tried to go for a run on Hampstead Heath -- still crowded on Wednesday -- with a NHS manager friend, but they never got going as the manager was always taking urgent phone calls. My brief experience of the NHS showed its problems. I'd had a cough since going to Munich, Germany for its security conference in mid-February. Or was it since I climbed into my parents' loft to help clear it out? I can't tell. After one boozy night a fortnight later, I woke up with a very mild fever (37.4 degrees Celsius/99.3 degrees Fahrenheit). I dialed 111 -- the NHS helpline -- and got told I probably didn't have coronavirus, but needed to see a doctor in the next two hours.Crowds still gather in London, here at a pub in Covent Garden, a popular tourist area. The doctor, herself suffering from a heavy cold, checked my vitals and diagnosed heavy man-flu and self-pity, saying I didn't really have a fever (below 38 degrees Celsius) and definitely didn't qualify for a test. She sent me packing. But a week later, the advice had changed and -- had I that fever and new cough now -- neither I, nor my partner, would have left the house for two weeks.This is where many friends stand, exchanging stories of a tightness of the chest or an unusual bout of flu that didn't seem to go away -- all over the past 6 weeks. We don't know if that means we had \"it,\" or just the flu. It's important to note that \"as of 9 a.m. on 18 March 2020, 56,221 people have been tested in the UK, of which 53,595 were confirmed negative and 2,626 positive,\" the government says. So even those with enough symptoms to be tested have a very low chance of having had coronavirus. Our ignorance should be chilling, but somehow I've filled the blanks with assumptions for comfort.A worker closes the gates at Barbican Underground station as public transport services in London are reduced.We've seen how drastic the planning for disaster is. Draft legislation would let police arrest those evading quarantine. Volunteer workers would have their wages protected if they help out the NHS. The army could be called in, certainly to ship supplies to hospitals, perhaps to do more. Hundreds of billions of dollars are being spent to keep the economy afloat, in extraordinary hurry, when the future is something no algorithm can grapple with.Be nice. And other lessons in how to handle panic, from Nick Paton WalshAs the weekend and its uncertainty approaches, we're left draining the most we can out of homes that used to be places of transit and rest, and are now where we keep our stores, work, house errant family members, and take deliveries with a new, alien appreciation.But also, in a city where eye contact a month earlier to some seemed like harassment, strangers are suddenly intimately aware of each other. Sometimes, so they can keep a medically safe distance. Sometimes, to be sure the elderly get where they need to on the crowded sidewalk. And sometimes, simply to smile, and take pleasure in letting the other person in the queue go first.",

He died at University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, police said.Whittingham's former club, Cardiff City, expressed heartbreak in a statement on its website. \"It is with an immeasurable amount of sorrow that we must inform supporters that Peter Whittingham has passed away at the age of 35. The news of Peter's sudden and untimely passing has shaken us to our very foundation. Our love goes out to his wife Amanda, their young son and family.\"First and foremost, Peter was a family man -- and somebody who could light up a room with his sense of humour, warmth and personality.

He made 16 appearances for England's Under-21 team in that time, scoring three goals, while featuring in Villa's Premier League side.But his real success came after transferring to Welsh side Cardiff City for \u00a3350,000 ($412,000) in 2007, according to the BBC. In his 10 years at the club, Whittingham became a firm fan favorite, making 456 appearances and scored 96 goals -- including 25 goals in one season from midfield. His languid style, his talented left foot -- former Germany midfielder Dietmar Hamann referred to as \"one of the best left pegs I've seen\" -- and his uncanny ability to score long-range goals helped Cardiff reach the 2008 FA Cup final and the 2012 League Cup final.

It's a clear signal that we stand together for Borussia, in good times and in bad,\" he added. \"They want to give something back to the club and therefore also to all the fans who support us.

Taro Aso has suggested that the Olympics get entwined in global affairs every 40 years, saying it is no surprise the virus, which has infected nearly 220,000 people worldwide, should threaten to cancel or postpone this year's Games.World War II forced the 1940 Summer and Winter Games in Japan to be canceled, while in 1980, the United States led a boycott of the Games in protest against the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan.\"The Sapporo Winter Olympics, which should have happened in 1940, went away, the next Moscow games in 1980 was half blown away because of the boycott of Western countries,\" Aso said. Taro Aso addresses parliament earlier this month. \"Another 40 years makes it this year. The mass media would love this expression if I say it's a cursed Olympics -- but it's a reality.\"Read MoreAso is no stranger to making controversial comments. Earlier this year he came under fire after apparently blaming childless women for Japan's demographic woes.This week, Olympic organizers announced that no \"drastic decisions\" will be made about the Games, currently scheduled to get underway in July, and urged athletes to continue their preparation as planned -- comments that roused dissent among the athlete community.JUST WATCHEDThe latest news in coronavirus affecting sport: WTA, MLB and BundesligaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe latest news in coronavirus affecting sport: WTA, MLB and Bundesliga 01:03Gyms, running tracks and training centers are closing around the world as members of the public are encouraged to stay indoors, while numerous qualifying events also face being canceled.Japan Olympic Committee board member Kaori Yamaguchi, a judo bronze medalist at the 1988 Olympics, called for the Games to be postponed because athletes are unable to prepare adequately.\"The Olympics should not be held in a situation people in the world can't enjoy,\" she told the Nikkei newspaper.\"As far as I can tell, athletes in the United States and Europe are unable to train as normal and finish their qualifying matches.

The order comes as the city's mayor Sadiq Khan urged Londoners not to travel unless it is essential to do so. \"Londoners should be avoiding social interaction unless absolutely necessary, and that means they should be avoiding using the transport network unless absolutely necessary.\"On Thursday morning, the government's communications team attempted to play down the prospect of a lockdown in the capital, a day after the prime Minister, Boris Johnson, declined to rule out stricter measures for the city.A handful of commuters during London's usually busy rush hour on Wednesday.On Wednesday, multiple government sources told CNN that conservations had taken place in Downing Street discussing measures ranging from shutting down parts of the capital's transport network to restricting travel in and out of the city. Similar reports appeared across the UK media. Read MoreOn Thursday, the Prime Minister's spokesman said there was \"zero prospect\" of any restrictions on travel in and out of London and that there were \"no plans\" to shut down London's transport network. However, London's transport authority had already closed parts of London's Tube network, and the government did not rule out introducing further social distancing measures in the coming days. London, by far the UK's busiest city, has been the worst-hit part of the country during the coronavirus pandemic. Of the 2,626 confirmed cases in the country, nearly 1,000 have been in London -- but health officials admit that the true number of people infected but not tested is likely far higher.An empty platform at Bank Underground station on Wednesday.The Tube closures are intended to allow the city's \"critical\" workers, including hospital staff, to make essential journeys, Transport for London said. The measure highlights the severity of the situation in Britain's capital. London's famous subway system -- the oldest in the world -- is used by around 2 million people every day, and has not seen extended mass closures since the the 7/7 terror attacks in 2005 shut down parts of the service for almost a month.\"London will get through these extraordinarily challenging times, and ensuring the capital's critical workers can move around the city will be crucial,\" Khan said.Giving evidence to the London assembly on Thursday, Khan said too many Londoners were failing to follow official advice. \"We are clearly still in the early phase of this crisis but the spread of the virus is at a more advanced stage in London than in other parts of the country. This means that further measures will need to be introduced at the point at which they will have the biggest effect,\" he said.CNN's Luke McGee contributed reporting",

        "content": "(CNN)Dana White's Ultimate Fighting Championship was an outlier until late in the sports world, trying to fight against the tide of ever-growing coronavirus cases, and maintain a business as usual attitude, by hosting a UFC Fight Night event last Saturday in Brasilia, Brazil, albeit without fans in the arena.White's willingness to seemingly keep calm and fight on came as a result of his speaking with both President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. Though White is at pains to point out that their guidance was not specific to UFC, it was \"be cautious, be safe, but don't panic. You don't want the entire country freaking out and panicking. And in times like these, people need to be entertained. \"People need to feel some sort of normalness going on,\" White told CNN Sport's Don Riddell. \"And you know, if I can still figure out ways to run the UFC and do it safely, and not put any of my people in harm then we were going to do it.\" READ: Olympics are 'cursed,' says Japan's deputy prime ministerRead MoreWhite speaks at President Trump's \"Keep America Great\" rally in Colorado Springs, Colorado.But a week can be a long time in politics, and this also applies to the running of a sports organization. At the time of writing, America has recorded at least 8,898 positive tests for the virus and 149 deaths.And it was no coincidence that after a more serious shift in tone from the President, the 50-year-old has followed suit. While the exuberant promoter inside of him will never completely disappear -- predicting that the Las Vegas strip going dark would be \"the craziest thing that has ever happened in my lifetime,\" for example -- White nevertheless has changed his mind, and thus the stance taken by the MMA organization. To that end, UFC Fight Night events on March 21, March 28 and April 11 have been postponed, following the White House's recommendation to avoid gatherings of 10 or more people. And although the language employed about the threat of the coronavirus has been on the colorful side by White -- something he doesn't \"regret at all\" -- he does now see that keeping his people employed is of paramount importance. \"Listen, we need to fight this thing,\" begins White. \"Let's work through this thing - that's what we do every week at the UFC. For anybody that says I'm not concerned with health and safety and all this other stuff, then you don't know me.\"And I always take care of my people, whether it's my fighters or my employees ... health and safety is something that I worry about every single week. Not (just) since the coronavirus popped up. I mean, it's what we do.\"White gets in between Derrick Lewis (left) and Alexander Volkov (right).White doubled down in his response to accusations of corporate greed, and betraying responsibility to his staff, fighters and the public, responding that: \"I could care less ... I haven't laid off one employee. \"You can accuse me of whatever you want ... You know what I did? I told all my people -- if any of them or their family members get sick, or have any problems, you call me, and I will get you taken care of.\"And while acknowledging that \"I've never seen anything like this in my lifetime,\" White knows firsthand that eventually the show will go on. The UFC was the first organization to put on events in Las Vegas after 9/11 and the Las Vegas shooting in 2017.\"This is nothing new for us, we've been through some stuff, but this is by far the craziest I've ever seen,\" he said. READ: French Open criticized for 'selfish, arrogant' rescheduling amid coronavirus outbreakWhite looks on as  Conor McGregor and Donald Cerrone face off. The futureThe UFC's next pay-per-view event is scheduled at the moment to occur on April 18 in Brooklyn, New York. On paper, UFC 249 promises to be possibly the fight of the year between the unbeaten Khabib Nurmagomedov and Tony Ferguson. White is confident that this highly anticipated event will go ahead. \"(I'm) on the phone all day every day trying to figure out how to get this thing off ... yes, that fight is on and I'm going to figure it out,\" he said. As was shown at the event in Brazil, holding a show behind closed doors is not something White is averse to doing. So if it came down to having Nurmagomedov and Ferguson -- arguably the biggest fight in years -- face off with no spectators and just cameramen filming it, would it still be worth doing for the UFC? \"Yeah, we're going to do it. I'm going to get this thing done,\" White maintains. And yet, inevitable doubts have also crept in. \"Ten days ago, I could have answered a lot of questions for you and I knew a lot of things. I don't know anything anymore. \"The world is such a different, crazy place. Las Vegas is shut down, casinos are closed. I never thought I would say that in my lifetime. So I really don't know anything anymore. I'm just out there trying to solve problems, is what I'm trying to do. I'm a problem solver. That's what I do and that's what I'm trying to do right now.\" READ: Chelsea pays for hospital staff to stay in club hotel amid coronavirus outbreakWhite speaks with UFC lightweight champion Nurmagomedov.Going with the flowMaking decisions in an ever-changing world also applies to President Trump, who White has supported over the years. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosHe even spoke at the Republican National Convention in 2016, when Trump was the GOP presidential nominee. Nearly four years on, how does he feel Trump has handled arguably the biggest crisis of his presidency? \"I think everybody from the President, to governors, to all the people that are involved in this thing, the CDC, it's been handled the best it could possibly be,\" asserts White. \"The citizens of the world and politicians have done the best job that they can do.\"",

        "content": "Rome (CNN)Italy is entering its fourth week of the worst national crisis since World War II with no end in sight.More than 60 million people are living under an increasingly unbearable lockdown that is growing tighter by the day. The stores that remain open are shuttering earlier and police are patrolling in ever-greater numbers, chasing families out for walks back into their homes and ensuring no one is outside without a valid reason.Related storiesAustralian leader: Outbreak is a 'once-in-100 year' crisisUS and China pin virus on each otherThe coronavirus is leaving empty spaces everywhereEven so, the number of novel coronavirus cases in the country is rising at a rate of around 3,500 new cases or more every day, and the death toll has topped 2,500.The highest concentration of cases is in the north of the country, where the dead are being stacked up to be buried as funeral services are strictly prohibited. But the living are stacked up too, with coronavirus patients being treated in field hospitals and lined up in corridors inside the bursting public hospitals. Doctors and nurses are being infected, due to a lack of adequate protection.Many wonder how this is going to end, and whether the economic cost of the lockdown is worth it. There are encouraging signs that the number of new cases in the original red zone in northern Italy may be leveling off, but experts say it is far too soon to consider this a reliable trend.  A medical emergency helicopter takes off from Brescia hospital in Italy. Experts say it is too early to say if cases are leveling off.Read MoreNo signs of change yetThere are more than 2,000 people in intensive care units across Italy -- the worst-affected country in Europe -- according to the latest official figures. Most are concentrated in Lombardy, where the crisis exploded on February 23, but many fear there will be new hotspot areas further south, where infrastructure is was already weaker and where fewer people are adhering to the lockdown measures. Police have given citations to nearly 200,000 people across the country and have said they will clamp down even more, starting this weekend, if people continue to flout the restrictions. Dr. Giorgio Pal\u00f9, the former president of the European and Italian Society for Virology and a professor of virology and microbiology of the University of Padova, told CNN he'd hoped to see the first signs of a change after just over a week of nationwide lockdown, but that has yet to materialize. \"Yesterday we expected to have a change after almost 10 days of this new measure ... but it's still rising,\" he told CNN. \"So I don't think we can make a prediction today.\"Is it safe for travelers to visit Italy?Pal\u00f9 said that looking at the number of new cases on a graph, the slope of the curve is still rising, making it hard to impossible when the lockdown will start to reap tangible benefits. And while the outbreak remains concentrated in the north, it's hard to compare regions. \"The virus has no border. Not even (in) Italy,\" he added.But he believes there's no alternative to the lockdown as long as everyone cooperates with it, and that the rights of citizens cannot overrule safety. \"We cannot adopt democracy in information, you must rely on experts.\" The lockdown should have been wider and stricter earlier, Pal\u00f9 believes, rather than just focusing on the 11 communities initially placed in the red zone, and it should be tighter now. \"We should have done more diagnostic tests in Lombardy where there was a big nucleus. There is no sense in trying to go to the supermarket once a week. You have to limit your time out, isolation is the key thing.\"  He says the Italian government lagged at first. It was \"lazy in the beginning... too much politics in Italy.\"\"There was a proposal to isolate people coming from the epicenter, coming from China,\" he said. \"Then it became seen as racist, but they were people coming from the outbreak.\" That, he said, led to the current devastating situation.The usually packed Fontana di Trevi in Rome lie empty during the lockdown imposed nationwide by the Italian government.Struggle to keep upDr. Alessandro Grimaldi, director of infectious disease at Salvatore Hospital in L'Aquila, treated Chiara Bonini, a 26-year-old doctor from Bergamo. Two weeks after Bonini contracted the virus from her boyfriend, a doctor working in a hospital in Brescia, she has now tested negative. But she will remain in quarantine until she tests negative for the virus a second time. If that happens, she will be able to return to work.\"In Lombardy, where I am from, the healthcare system has collapsed,\" she told CNN, adding that doctors were triaging patients to decide which ones to treat. \"There just isn't enough equipment. They choose the young, the medical rule of trying to save who has more probability to live.\"Grimaldi said the only way to fight the battle to keep the healthcare system from total collapse is to increase resources. \"Maybe the government should have thought of this before, prepare better,\" he said. \"But if you don't see the emergency in front of you, you try to cut.\"Italy's nightmare is making me rethink life in rural IowaGrimaldi said that without more resources, the doctors will continue to struggle to keep up. \"Today Italy is in the hands of doctors and nurses: there is a team work on the first lines that is fighting a battle for the patient,\" he told CNN. \"We are soldiers that fight for our country. If we can end the epidemic here in Italy, we can stop the epidemic in Europe and the world.\"He also agrees that the only way the lockdown will reap benefits is if it is rigidly enforced.  \"Fighting an enemy like this is difficult for everyone,\" he said. \"China showed us you needed to take drastic measures. Italy was the first to stop flights to China, first country in Europe to do the lockdown.\"Alessandro Vergallo, a specialist in anaesthesia and intensive care, said he worried that the European Union delayed its reaction to save the economy. \"Of course, Italy's government responded faster and better than many other European countries. Many were embarrassing,\" he told CNN. \"Now, the measures of containment that have gone into effect will help diminish the contagion.\"But he doesn't want to cast blame. \"It's not the time for controversy. But we are gathering all the necessary data from the end of 2019 to then analyze the behavior of the institutions both national and international in the face of this pandemic. To understand if everything worked when it was supposed to or to understand who failed,\" he said.He warned that any return to normality won't happen for months. \"Yesterday we were trying to interpret when the flattening of the curve would happen. Since it's an unknown virus, it's hard to interpret the data. We hope that by March 26, we should see a decrease in numbers,\" he tells CNN. \"I think the fear of the various EU institutions feared the damage to the European economy would be bigger than that of the virus. Now we are all paying, not just in Italy, but also other European countries. A huge human and economic price is being paid.\"The lockdown has stretched the very fabric of Italian society. The people are anxious and the economy is in tatters. Easter, which traditionally kicks off the tourist season across the country, has all but been cancelled, costing small and medium size businesses their livelihoods. Many have already said they will never reopen. As people default on their loans, both personal and business, the banks will likely need help, and the domino effect of this historical crisis will last long after Italy stops tallying new cases.This story has been corrected to reflect that Chiara Bonini was the doctor who tested negative for the virus. The headline has been updated to better reflect the views expressed in it.",

When one player spoke nonsense to another (in the past), it was among us.  \"When I went to play in Europe it happened a lot.

I swear to God,\" Pele says. \"I remember that Athi\u00ea Jorge Cury, Santos' president at the time, talked to my father, who worked at the health station in Bauru.\"He learned that at Baquinho [nickname of Bauru AC] there was a boy and asked if he could take his son, Pel\u00e9, to practice at Santos. I always thought it was a joke. I was 13 to 14 years old and I wasn't even a main player at Baquinho. \"Coincidentally, Athi\u00ea Jorge Cury was a friend of my father and I went for a trial at Santos and was approved.

How funny life is.\"Pele is the only player in history to have won three World Cups.Now and thenDespite the vast improvements in technology and training, Pele believes modern day football is far more challenging than it was during his era.He says that while his generation and those that followed put on more of a performance for the fans, modern players who just want to \"destroy\" the ball, as he puts it, makes it more difficult for today's artists to put on a show.\"I think it is more difficult. Playing soccer today is much more difficult that in the past, no doubt at all,\" he says. \"Because in my time, with all due respect to colleagues, I think we had a little more freedom to stop the ball. Now there's not so much anymore. \"Therefore, even some players who are friends of mine at that time say that it is not so. I talk to Beckenbauer, Maradona and Cruyff. I say: 'In the past, people used to play ball, now the guys don't want to play ball, they just want to destroy it, they don't want to let one play.'\"It gets boring because those who pay to go to the stadium, pay to go to see a show. They don't pay to be seen fouls every time. So, in our time I think that it was better for the fans because we gave more shows than the current soccer.\"",

Speaking at a news conference Wednesday, Morrison bluntly told Australians to \"stop hoarding\" essential foodstuffs. \"Stop it. It's not sensible, it's not helpful and I've got to say, it's been one of the most disappointing things I've seen in Australian behavior in response to this crisis. That is not who we are as a people,\" he said.Morrison, who has faced criticism from some doctors for not imposing stricter social isolation measures, also announced extended restrictions on mass gatherings to all indoor events with more than 100 people, however, he insisted that schools would remain open to ensure hospitals were properly staffed.\"This is a once-in-100 year type event, we haven't seen this sort of thing in Australia since the end of the first World War, but together we are of course up to this challenge,\" he said.Read MoreMorrison warned the disruptions could continue for \"at least six months ... it could be much longer.\" As of Wednesday there were more than 450 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Australia, according to local health authorities.

Hashem Abedi was convicted of 22 counts of murder, one of attempted murder, and one of conspiracy to cause an explosion, at the Old Bailey in London on Tuesday. Salman Abedi: Bomber in Ariana Grande concert attackHis older brother, Salman Abedi, detonated a bomb which killed 22 concertgoers and injured hundreds more -- many of them children and young people -- as they left Manchester Arena in May 2017. Hashem Abedi, 22, was in Libya at the time of the attack, but was arrested shortly after the bombing and extradited back to the UK in 2019. During the six week trial, prosecutors said Abedi \"encouraged and helped his brother\" knowing Salman \"planned to commit an atrocity.\" Read More\"He has blood on his hands, even if he didn't detonate the bomb,\" Max Hill, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said in a statement after the verdict. 'Heinous crime'Hashem Abedi was not in court for the verdict, after declining to give evidence and firing his lawyers, according to PA News Agency.  Crowds gather at diva-style funeral for Manchester attack victim Martyn Hett\"This verdict will not heal the wounds of the 264 people physically injured in the attack, many of whom have life-changing injuries,\" Paul Hett, whose son Martyn was killed in the bombing, said in a statement after the verdict. \"And this verdict will not help over 670 people who suffered psychological trauma after the attack, many still suffering today,\" he added. \"But what this verdict will do is give an overwhelming sense of justice to all those affected by this heinous crime.\"Prosecutors presented the jury with a timeline of events in their case against him. 'Extremist mindset'The court heard how Hashem Abedi had asked close acquaintances to buy chemicals, that could be used to make explosives, on his behalf; they said he sourced metal drums to build bomb prototypes; and bought a car used to store the bomb components, according to a statement by Greater Manchester Police. \"Witnesses also gave evidence in court which suggested the brothers had developed an extremist mindset. One witness stated in court that, in his opinion, Hashem 'believed in terrorism',\" it added. Manchester attack: Why the Libya connection mattersThe brothers traveled to Libya together in April 2017 to see family. Hashem remained in the North African country and Salman returned to the UK in May -- collecting components from the car and finishing the construction of the bomb, police said. \"On 22 May 2017, Salman Abedi entered the Manchester Arena and detonated the device that he and Hashem had created, killing himself and 22 other people, and injuring almost 1,000 members of the public,\" police wrote.The two brothers grew up in Manchester with their parents, who had fled Libya under the late Moammar Gadhafi's regime. Their father, Ramadan, returned to Libya in 2011 after rebels overthrew the government during the wave of protests known as the Arab Spring. His wife joined him in early 2017.",

The United States had 12, and the United Kingdom just 3. Sporting events, concerts and social gatherings were continuing as normal, and much of the world's population was blissfully unaware of the unprecedented crisis looming.And for the remaining participants in the long-running reality series, that's how it has stayed.The popular global reality TV franchise puts a group of strangers into a house for weeks on end, completely cutting off their contact with the outside world.Producers have stuck to that principle even as borders have slammed shut, stock markets have sunk and the world has ground towards an unimaginable halt. Read MoreAll the virtual concerts, plays, museums and other culture you can enjoy from homeBut on Tuesday evening, the contestants on the German program will finally be updated about the pandemic -- live, on television, in a heavily-publicized special episode of the show.\"Big Brother will give all contestants the latest information about COVID-19 in Germany and the whole world tonight,\" a spokesperson for the broadcaster Sat.1 told CNN, adding that the cast will be able to ask questions to the show's resident doctor.\"The first contestants had been cut off from the outside world in preparation for the show on February, 6th. Theoretically they could know about the virus outbreak in Wuhan/China but don't know anything about the current situation in Germany,\" the spokesperson added.Newer contestants, who entered the show just days ago, have been banned from telling others about the pandemic.Contestants on the German \"Big Brother\" set.The decision raises questions about how and when reality television should allow the real world in, and differs from the approach taken by other versions of the show. Some commentators online said the scenario resembled the 2008 British drama \"Dead Set,\" in which contestants on the UK's \"Big Brother\" were unaware of a zombie apocalypse taking place outside.On the Canadian version of the program, which is also currently on air, a viral clip from last week showed contestants speculating as to why there was no live audience to greet the latest person voted off the show. Mass gatherings have been scaled down and discouraged in Canada, as with other major countries.\"We would have seen them,\" one contestant is heard saying on the show, which constantly airs a live feed online. \"Unless the house is now soundproof?\" another suggests. Eventually, the Big Brother figure tells the contestants to \"please stop talking\" over the PA system.A reality TV contestant had to watch her own alleged assault. Now Spain wants answersBut over the weekend, the feed was paused and the contestants on the show gathered in the living room, before a producer told them about the coronavirus outbreak over the PA, a spokeswoman for broadcaster Global TV told CNN. \"This just didn't feel like something you couldn't not tell everybody about,\" she explained. Producers ensured the contestants' families were unaffected, and contestants were checked for and cleared of coronavirus symptoms by the show's doctor.The Brazilian show, which has aired since January, has followed a similar format by informing their contestants. They have since featured segments in which contestants have been given hand sanitizer.",

The majority of Europe's top football leagues have been suspended because of the virus and Italy, France and Spain have all introduced lockdown restrictions on millions of citizens as they try to lessen COVID-19's impact.\"We are at the helm of a sport that vast numbers of people live and breathe that has been laid low by this invisible and fast-moving opponent,\" said UEFA President Aleksander \u010ceferin.

The thought of celebrating a pan-European festival of football in empty stadia, with deserted fan zones while the continent sits at home in isolation, is a joyless one and one we could not accept to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the competition.\"The remaining EURO 2020 play-off matches set for the end of March have been rescheduled to the start of June, subject to review given how the coronavirus pandemic plays out.Copa America has also been postponed until next year and will run at the same time as the European Championship, in order to lessen the impact on club football.

Spain's recorded cases of the virus surged by 1,400 overnight, to a total of 9,190, with 309 deaths, its Health Ministry said. Meanwhile Italy has over 24,000 cases and more than 1,800 deaths, according to the WHO.The country's land borders were closed Monday, Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska announced. The closure does not include Spanish nationals and residents, workers required to cross the border, and the transport of goods. Some 47 million Spanish residents have been banned from leaving their homes -- with the exception of those going to work, buying food, going to a hospital, or supporting an elderly person or child in their care.A member of the Spanish Military Emergency Unit (UME) stands guard near Madrid's Atocha train station on Sunday.The few people still walking in Madrid's eerily empty parks on Monday were met by buzzing drones overhead, instructing them to: \"Go home!\"Priests in the deeply Catholic country are celebrating Mass alone, with services shown only on TV or via social media. Restaurants and bars have been closed. And cultural sites like the Prado Museum and Royal Palace in Madrid are also shut, as part of the tough measures announced by Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Saturday.  The same day, the government announced that the prime minister's wife, Maria Begona Gomez Fernandez, had tested positive for the virus.

Madrid's Metro posted CCTV images of deserted platforms Monday morning, adding that it had seen 75% fewer commuters than during rush hour last week.It was a different story on the trains however, which passengers from out of town rely on to get into the city. At the central Atocha train station, commuters lined the platform and many told CNN that safe distances were not being maintained on board.Commuters on a busy train at Madrid's Atocha train station.\"It's shameful,\" passenger Librada Aguilera told CNN. \"There are fewer trains which means they are very full.

Supermarkets were largely empty on Monday, with cashiers changing their gloves and disinfecting conveyor belts after every every customer, CNN reporters found. At a supermarket in central Madrid, lines taped on the ground indicate how far apart customers should stand.\"Most Spaniards are compliant\" with the restrictions, one police officer patrolling the streets of Madrid told CNN. \"Though they are taking far too much time to walk the dog or shop for food,\" he said, adding that this was \"a trick\" to stay outside for longer.To get people off the streets, police can issue fines starting at $100. But the officer admitted that \"fines won't solve this.\"\"We all have to do this in solidarity, knowing that everyone is staying at home,\" he said.Militares de la Brigada Paracaidista @EjercitoTierra trasladan al Hospital de Alcal\u00e1 de Henares #Madrid 45 camas cedidas por dos hoteles de la ciudad #EsteVirusLoParamosUnidos pic.twitter.com/j6vqRvDl1v\u2014 Ministerio Defensa (@Defensagob) March 16, 2020\n\nSome hotels have offered up their beds to help ease the strain on hospitals.

Believers first hailed it as \"miraculous\" because it survived a fire which burned down the church on May 23, 1519.Three years after the fire, during Rome's Great Plague, the crucifix was carried by the faithful in procession through all the neighborhoods of Rome, from San Marcello to St. Peter's Basilica.The procession lasted 16 days, from August 4 to 20. Legend has it that the plague ended on the day the crucifix reached St. Peter's.Pope Francis walks along the normally bustling Via del Corso in Rome on March 15, 2020. The street was almost empty because of Italy's strict coronavirus restrictions.Since the 1600s, processions from the Church of San Marcello to St. Peter's Basilica have taken place during Jubilee Years. John Paul II embraced the crucifix during the Jubilee Year of 2000.Shortly before praying before San Marcello's crucifix, Pope Francis visited the icon of the Virgin Mary in the Church of St. Mary Major.Pope Francis gives his blessing to an eerily empty St. Peter's SquareKnown as Mary, Health of Romans (Salus Populi Romani) it is a favorite icon of Pope Francis; he visits it to pray before and after every papal trip, and ahead of other important events.Like the San Marcello crucifix, the icon was also carried in procession in an effort to help stop a plague -- this one in 593 -- by Pope St. Gregory the Great. In 1837, prayers were offered to the icon by Pope Gregory XVI in an attempt to end a cholera pandemic, according to the Vatican.",

        "content": "(CNN)Simon Crow is not a professional athlete. But he has spent the last three months running six times a week, clocking in between 40 and 60 miles. Feeling great, Crow was hoping for a new personal best in the Paris marathon next month. And then the novel coronavirus struck and his marathon got called off. With society shutting down will Tokyo 2020 go ahead? \"Twelve weeks of marathon training down the pan,\" said Crow, who is one of hundreds of thousands of runners who have had their big spring races canceled or postponed after months of training and sacrifice.Paris, Tokyo, Boston, London, Rome, Barcelona, Manchester, Rotterdam and Vienna are among the cities that have announced their marathons wouldn't take place as planned because of the outbreak.\"The world is in an unprecedented situation grappling with a global pandemic of COVID-19 and public health is everyone's priority,\" Hugh Brasher, the event director of the London Marathon, said in a statement on Friday. Read More\"We know how disappointing this news will be for so many -- the runners who have trained for many months, the thousands of charities for which they are raising funds and the millions who watch the race every year,\" he added.While most runners say the cancellations are understandable, the feeling of disappointment is hard to shake off. Marathon running might be becoming more mainstream, but the feat still requires months, sometimes years of hard work.Major disappointmentSimon Crow, Karina Voggel and Todd Prescott are among the hundreds of thousands who have had their races called off this spring.Todd Prescott was scheduled to run the Boston Marathon next month.It would have been his sixth and final of the World Marathon Majors, a series of the most prestigious marathons in the world that includes Tokyo, Boston, London, Berlin, Chicago and New York. Completing all six is a huge achievement, not least because getting a place in these big races is becoming increasingly difficult. Only 6,401 runners have managed the full series so far, according to the official count. Apart from Boston, Prescott, a contract pilot based in London, was also planning to run the Edinburgh marathon in May. That race was canceled too, though the money he raised for charity -- around $1,250 for the Boston First Responders community -- won't be lost.Prescott said he knew the decisions were made in the interest of the public good. \"I was disappointed, but not surprised,\" he said.How the coronavirus is impacting sport\"Fortunately in both cases, the races were not canceled outright but only postponed, so I'll just have to train again when the time comes and will use the training I've done so far serve as a foundation for further improvement,\" he added.That kind of attitude is not just reserved for amateur runners. The world's fastest marathoner Eliud Kipchoge is advising the same.\"To the thousands of runners who with me, have devoted the last months of our lives towards this goal I would like to say: Be proud of the work you have put into this journey, keep smiling and seek your next goal on the horizon to continue running in a smooth and positive way,\" the Kenyan runner posted on his Instagram account. Kipchoge was set to run the London Marathon in what was going to be a major showdown between him and Ethiopia's Kenenisa Bekele.Bekele's personal best is just two seconds slower than Kipchoge's world record and the two were preparing to battle it out in the British capital in April. \"I hope to share the starting line with you again soon,\" Kipchoge added.         View this post on Instagram           It is unfortunate news that the @londonmarathon has been postponed but I fully respect the decision made by the organization as safeguarding the health of the world always takes our top priority. To the thousands of runners who with me, have devoted the last months of our lives towards this goal I would like to say:\u00a0 Be proud of the work you have put into this journey, keep smiling and seek your next goal on the horizon to continue running in a smooth and positive way. I hope to share the starting line with you again soon. #nnrunningteam #londonmarathon A post shared by  Eliud Kipchoge - EGH\ud83c\uddf0\ud83c\uddea (@kipchogeeliud) on Mar 13, 2020 at 10:23am PDT\nFinancial hitIt's not just the training that is lost.Crow and his partner, who was also scheduled to run in Paris, can't make the new date in the fall. The marathon organizers are not allowing runners to defer their places until next year and won't refund the $135 entry fees either.That means the money Crow spent on the race, travel and hotel for him, his partner and her two sons who were coming to support, is lost. \"There are high risks involved in marathon running because you can get injured at any time, wasting lots of training hours, but this also includes the\u00a0financial side,\" he said. \"Once you click 'Pay' there is a possibility the organizers have to change things due to unforeseen circumstances.\"Paris would have been Crow's 10th marathon.\"I know [the training] won't be wasted in the long run as I plan on running at least another autumn marathon as well as New York in November,\" he said. But he admitted feeling disheartened, because he was hoping for a fast time in Paris.The start of the Tokyo Marathon in 2019 (right) and 2020 (left). The 2020 race was limited to elite runners because of the outbreak.Crow is a professional angler, so fitting training around work can be tricky.\"My work is usually quieter in the winter so it helps me to get better quality runs,\" he said.Crow was hoping to run the marathon in under three hours, or at least as close as possible to the three hour mark. That would be fast enough time to guarantee him one of the coveted \"Good for Age\" places in the London Marathon next year. Marathon running has become more popular in recent years and entering any of the big races is becoming increasingly tricky.Nearly half a million people applied for the London Marathon lottery this year, making the odds of landing a spot pretty slim.Another option, running for a charity, requires raising thousands of dollars, not something many people can do on regular basis. Qualifying with a fast time from another race is by far the safest option. Coronavirus: Which countries have travel bans? Like Crow, astronomer Karina Voggel was also hoping to run a fast time in Paris. She has spent the last three months running five times a week, averaging 40 miles a week. She's given up a lot to be in the best shape possible.\"I do all my runs early in the morning and I can't go out drinking if I want to run 30k at 8 a.m. on Saturday morning,\" she said.Voggel had her sight on three hours and 30 minutes, a time that would get her a spot in the Boston Marathon next year.\"Of course I was sad,\" she said. \"This had been my goal in training since November ... but in the end the health of vulnerable people needs to be protected and I can give up my marathon for that,\" she added.",

        "content": "(CNN)As Covid-19 spreads with alacrity around the world, billion-dollar sports leagues have been brought to a halt.Thursday in the US was one of the most extraordinary in the country's sports history as the NBA, the WNBA and the much-anticipated NCAA's men's and women's basketball tournaments were among the major events suspended or postponed. Competitions once regarded as shatterproof have been affected. The English Premier League, often described as the world's richest soccer league, on Friday announced a suspension.But the Olympic Games, the biggest sporting spectacle of all, is still set to go ahead, which begs the question: with society shutting down as a result of a worldwide pandemic, will the Olympics really be held in Tokyo this summer? Read MoreWhat has been said? On Saturday, Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the Olympics will go ahead, while the day before Japan's Olympics Minister Seiko Hashimoto had dismissed suggestions that Tokyo 2020 should be postponed.Responding to comments made by US President Donald Trump, who had suggested the Games should be rescheduled, Hashimoto said neither the local organizing committee or the International Olympic Committee (IOC) had considered postponing or canceling the Games. Coronavirus outbreak provides sobering reality for sports\"We continue to proceed preparations to hold a safe and secure Games that will open on July 24,\" said Hashimoto.On March 12, the day the Olympic torch was lit in ancient Olympia without spectators because of ongoing concerns over COVID-19, the IOC said it was \"fully committed\" to holding the Games, set to run from July 24 to August 9, in Tokyo.\"Nineteen weeks before the opening ceremony of the Games we are strengthened in our commitment by many organizations around the world taking significant measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus,\" Thomas Bach, the IOC president, said. Much is still unknown The coronavirus has infected more than 132,500 people and killed nearly 5,000 globally, according to the World Health Organization.COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, is thought to kill some 1-2% of known patients, compared to around 0.1% for winter influenza, but much remains unknown about it.Japan has so far seen a relatively low number of infections compared with neighboring South Korea and China. However, a spike in confirmed cases has sparked fears of a more severe outbreak in the country.The country experienced an uptick in numbers on Tuesday, with 54 more cases reported -- one of the biggest single-day jumps since the outbreak began, according to the country's Ministry of Health.And Japan has come under immense international scrutiny for its handling of the outbreak,  specifically over its quarantine of the stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama Bay.A woman wearing a face mask walks past the Olympic rings in front of the new National Stadium, the main stadium for Tokyo 2020.Health experts have also previously raised concerns over the country's approach to testing, which has seen only small numbers screened for the virus.Masahiro Kami, executive director of Japanese non-profit Medical Governance Research Institute, told CNN last week that the official infection rate is likely just the \"tip of the iceberg.\"This week the country canceled the annual public service in Tokyo which marks the Fukushima disaster.The start of the baseball, football and rugby sevens seasons have already been delayed, while a major sumo tournament that opened in Osaka last weekend was held without spectators for the first time in its history.With the Games still scheduled to go ahead, the outbreak in Japan and the government's handling of it will continue to be under heightened scrutiny.What are the options for Tokyo 2020?If the Games were being held now, it would be difficult to imagine how organizers could go ahead as planned. Thousands of people converging in Tokyo during a pandemic would surely not be countenanced.But Tokyo 2020 has time. Experts hope warmer weather will help fight the virus, though it is yet unclear whether that theory is true.The Olympic movement essentially has two opportunities to make money, at the Summer Games and the Winter Olympics, so with billions of dollars at stake, in ticket sales, hospitality and sponsorship especially, organizers are as yet unwilling to contemplate a delay or cancellation. Tiger Woods' Masters defense postponed because of coronavirusWith the authority to cancel the Games, it is the IOC which is in control. Earlier this month, IOC member Dick Pound admitted a decision to cancel could be made as late as May.The situation remains fluid and talk of holding the Games elsewhere has been widely quashed. As Professor Victor Matheson, a sports economist who has written on the economics of the Olympics, told CNN Sport: \"Any world where Japan is too unsafe to hold the Olympics, London is also too unsafe to hold the Olympics.\"It is widely regarded that the options available are: to hope the outbreak eases and go ahead as planned, to hold the Games without spectators, to postpone or cancel completely. The economic costs of Tokyo 2020Canceling the Games would be unprecedented in peacetime. The cost of hosting, organizers said in December, was some 1.35 trillion yen ($12.35 billion) but, according to Reuters, that figure did not include the cost of moving the marathon and walking events from Tokyo to Sapporo to avoid the summer heat. According to Reuters, Japan's Board of Audit put government spending on the Games between 2013 and 2018 at 1.06 trillion yen ($9.81billion). Sponsors, insurers and broadcasters have also committed billions to the Games.Professor Matheson believes the truer sum is likely to be $25 billion, a vast majority of which has already been spent on large-scale infrastructure projects such as transportation networks, hotels and new venues.\"Whether the Games go on or not, most of this investment is a sunk cost at this point,\" Professor Matheson said.\"If you were to cancel the Olympics, you would be able to avoid some of the costs, such as billion dollars of security, if Tokyo's security costs were similar to London, but the biggest cost is all of the infrastructure and most of that spending has already taken place.\" A general view of the Olympic rings as they are illuminated for the first time to mark 6 months to go to the Olympic games at Odaiba Marine Park on January 24, 2020.If the Tokyo 2020 was canceled, who'd be the losers?Professor Matheson points to the IOC and the local organizing committee as being among the biggest losers in the event of cancellation, though both organizations will be insured. \"This isn't Delta Airlines, where we cancel a bunch of flights but once we solve the problem things are back to normal,\" he said, describing the Olympics as \"totally non-diversified.\"Another big loser would be Tokyo's hospitality industry.\"If we look at other host cities, the total number of international tourists was likely to increase by 100,000 visitors and those visitors were paying much higher room rental rates than the people they would have been replacing,\" said Matheson.Premier League hit by decision to postpone all English football\"That's potentially at least hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions, in lost revenue for the hospitality industry and that's probably not insurable.\"And then there are the sponsors, Matheson adds: \"If the Games don't go on at all, there are $3 billion worth of sponsorships that have been purchased and it's hard to know where that money goes if the Games don't all go on.\"That is a loss to someone, that's either a loss to broadcasters or it's a loss to the IOC, because they don't get the revenue from the contract, or it's a loss to an insurer.\"Somewhere along the line you have this valuable product that was going to produce all this TV entertainment and someone's going to lose that revenue somewhere.\"Japan's GDP, however, would not take a significant hit, said Matheson.\"In any scenario where the Olympic Games are canceled, the other costs associated with coronavirus are going to make the Olympic costs seem like a drop in the bucket.\" What is the least costly alternative for the IOC?Postponing the Games by a few months has been mentioned as an option for the IOC should it be deemed unsafe for the Games to go ahead as scheduled.But TV rights holders would be unhappy with having to schedule the Olympics during the NFL season in the US and the European soccer season.After all, the Games are being held in August, despite the potential dangers the scorching weather could pose to athletes, because the wants of rights holders far outweighs that of the athletes.If the show was unable to go on as planned, holding the Games this summer without spectators would be the least costly, according to Matheson.Sponsors, athletes, and TV rightsholders would still have an Olympics, he said, with Japan's tourism sector being the biggest loser.\"You still need the athletes and production officials, which may still be too many people in one place during a severe outbreak. It would cost you all your tourism money and about a billion dollars in ticket revenue,\" said Matheson.\"But you still get to keep your $3-4 billion of TV rights. The athletes are still on the world stage and you get to keep the majority of your sponsorship money.\"It keeps a lot of your revenue intact and there's no scheduling issues. Postponing it by a year would be massively costly, this would be multibillions of dollars, but at least you would have all your revenue streams intact that year later.\"The National Stadium, the main stadium for Tokyo 2020, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium (C-R). What about the athletes?Competing at the Olympics is the pinnacle for the majority of athletes taking part. Sacrifices have been made, lives put on hold, training sessions meticulously planned for a career-defining moment.If the Games were to be canceled, so too would an athlete's shot at glory. Gone would be the opportunity to become an Olympic champion and the sponsorship opportunities that come with that. Then, there are the older athletes, those who have one final chance at greatness. There is an economic cost, and a human one too.There are also the athletes who have yet to secure qualification. Athletes needing to improve their rankings may miss out completely because qualification events have been rescheduled. Baseball's final qualifying event, for example, has been moved from April to June. Simone Biles is expected to be one of the star athletes at Tokyo 2020Dave Hembrough, Sheffield Hallam University's lead for strength and conditioning, told CNN Sport said that while athletes were resilient the uncertainty would be disruptive, especially to those attempting to qualify and attending training camps.\"Those who are the best in the world will be so driven for the purpose of being the best, it won't disturb them much,\" he said.\"But if athletes don't qualify, they don't compete and it might lead to organizations not having the best athletes qualifying and, therefore, reducing the chance of winning medals.\"I'm involved with British weightlifting ... one of the things people are concerned with is the financial commitment of signing up for camps for competition, travel for hotels that are then going to be subsequently canceled. A lot of organizations cannot afford that.\" What happens next? On Friday, the Greek Olympic Committee (HOC) suspended the remainder of the Olympic torch relay through the country to avoid attracting crowds. The decision was made in agreement with the health ministry and the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The handover of the flame to Tokyo 2020 Games organizers is still set to take place as scheduled at the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens on March 19 without spectators.But whether Tokyo's Olympic cauldron will be lit in July remains, much like the virus, unknown.",

This is the greatest victory of my life,\" said Schachmann, who led the race from start to finish after taking the opening stage, which were marked by brutal crosswinds.Read MoreQuintana suffered a crash on that stage and was unable to retrieve the time he lost, but showed his undoubted class to finish the \"Race to the Sun\" with such an emphatic display.World champion pulls out Organizers ASO, who also run the Tour de France, had taken an earlier decision to cut Sunday's eighth and final stage in light of the health concerns for both riders and spectators.But some questioned the wisdom of continuing the race at all in the light of the rapidly escalating crisis, while seven leading teams, including Team Ineos and Movistar, did not take up their invitations to participate in the world tour race. The Bahrain-McLaren team subsequently withdrew before the start of stage six and Israel Start-Up Nation announced they would not be starting Saturday's stage.World road race champion Mads Pedersen of Denmark was another non-starter, the Trek-Segafredo rider issuing a statement to explain his decision.\"My country has asked that all Danish nationals go home as soon as possible, so in agreement with the team I'm not taking the start this morning to respect this decision.\"Denmark announced Friday it would shut its borders to most foreign visitors for a month from Saturday in an effort to tackle spread of the virus.Bardet criticizes organizersHome favorite Romain Bardet was one of 92 riders in a depleted field to start the final stage, but aired his views the previous evening to French media.\"I didn't understand why the race went on today.

        "content": "London (CNN)When Republican lawmakers this week abruptly canceled a plan to subpoena a former Ukrainian official in their investigations into the energy firm that hired former Vice President Joe Biden's son, they said it was to allow more time for senators to receive additional briefings.But a Ukrainian magazine editor has told CNN that the target of the subpoena, Andrii Telizhenko, once offered him money to lobby US senators on behalf of pro-Russian media outlets. A former Ukrainian diplomat, Telizhenko is an ally of Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and has been an enthusiastic proponent of the debunked theory that Ukraine, and not Russia, interfered in the 2016 US elections. Telizhenko has also backed Republican claims that Trump's Democratic rival, Joe Biden, shut down an investigation into the Ukrainian gas company Burisma when his son, Hunter, served on its board. Biden has consistently denied any wrongdoing.The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee called off a vote to subpoena Telizhenko earlier this week, amid accusations from Democrats that the investigation was calculated to damage Biden's presidential bid. Questions also swirled about Telizhenko's reliability as a witness -- the FBI briefed staff on issues connected to the subpoena on Tuesday, the day before the committee was supposed to vote, according to a Senate Democratic aide. Telizhenko says he's the victim of a smear campaign and flatly denied to CNN he was a \"Russian agent.\"Andrii Telizhenko, a former Ukrainian official, who has become involved in Republican efforts to pursue Joe Biden.Read MoreIn a development that could raise more questions about Telizhenko's reliability, Vladislav Davidzon, who runs a magazine called the Odessa Review, has told CNN that Telizhenko offered him $5,000 in 2018 to approach prominent Republicans to speak out against efforts by Kiev to curb the influence of two TV stations.CNN has reviewed a series of messages between the two men that came against the backdrop of an attempt by Ukrainian lawmakers to censure two channels, 112 and News One, for allegedly broadcasting Russian propaganda in the years following Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014.In October 2018, the same month that lawmakers voted in favor of a resolution to sanction the two stations, Telizhenko wrote to Davidzon, asking:  \"Have a question do you or your father have contacts with US Senators? I really need a favour for witch (sic) I can pay up to 5k.\" Davidzon, 35, is the son of influential US-based Russian language media owner Gregory Davidzon -- once dubbed \"The Kingmaker of Little Russia\" in a 2012 profile by The New York Times.After expressing concerns about how the new Ukrainian proposals could shut the broadcasters down, Telizhenko then says: \"My question is is it possible to get an official comment on a Senators (Rand Paul, Lindsey Graham for example) website next week about this situation of censorship in Ukraine? Really important for me and need fast.\"Davidzon replies: \"Ok. I have a bit of time. But not sure what I can do.\"Davidzon told CNN that he considered the offer of money to target senators like Graham was \"improper\" and never reached out to any US lawmakers as a result.Magazine editor Vladislav Davidzon says he was offered money by a Giuliani ally to lobby US senators.In a telephone interview on Friday, Telizhenko said he had indeed contacted a small number of people including Davidzon on behalf of 112 and News One. He said the approaches were made on his own initiative and that the money he offered was his own, for expenses incurred.Graham's office declined to comment. Paul's office did not reply, nor did representatives for the two television stations.Republican-led investigations that could entangle Biden have been gathering speed amid the former Vice President's surge in the Democratic presidential primaries. Sen. Ron Johnson, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, had scheduled a vote on whether to subpoena Telizhenko on Wednesday. Johnson wanted access to information Telizhenko claims to have on Blue Star Strategies, a political consultancy which once employed Telizhenko and that had carried out work for Burisma. However the vote -- which was expected to pass along party lines -- was called off at the last minute after Johnson wrote to committee members saying he wanted to leave more time for additional briefings. He said he would seek records directly from Blue Star instead.Sen. Ron Johnson, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee.The top Democrat on Johnson's committee, Sen. Gary Peters, had been opposed to subpoenaing Telizhenko, arguing that the probes could be tainted by Russian disinformation. He had requested members receive an intelligence briefing on the Ukrainian before considering him as a witness. The decision to call off the vote, however, came as a surprise.The effort to enlist Telizhenko was launched in December 2019 by a trio of Republican senators -- Johnson, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Graham, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Charles Grassley, chairman of the Finance Committee. They demanded interviews and documents from Telizhenko and Alexandra Chalupa, a former Democratic National Committee contractor. Telizhenko has said that, when he was a diplomat at the Ukrainian embassy in Washington, he was instructed to work with Chalupa to \"dig for dirt\" on Trump and his team.The DNC and Chalupa have always denied the claims. Yet Telizhenko's insistence upon repeating them brought him into Giuliani's orbit. He accompanied the former New York City mayor on a so-called fact finding mission to Kiev in November and appeared on his podcast earlier this year.With America's Mayor @RudyGiuliani filming new episode of the #CommonSense podcast which will air tomorrow.Stay tuned, you will hear new evidence and facts on the Obama Admin and their illegal actions in Ukraine.Americans and Ukrainians deserve to know the #Truth. @DonaldJTrumpJr pic.twitter.com/bTjuG06aor\u2014 Andrii Telizhenko (@AndriyUkraineTe) February 25, 2020\n\nWhile Sens. Johnson and Grassley have continued to pursue the debunked theory that Ukraine was responsible for an effort to destabilize Trump, Graham has more recently cooled on the effort. In February, Graham said any information coming from Ukraine should be treated with caution.Telizhenko told CNN that the criticisms of him were part of a smear campaign, saying he had been expecting it after he was detained for four hours at New York's John F. Kennedy airport on his arrival in the United States in February.Speaking on Friday, Telizhenko said he understood the vote to subpoena him had been canceled at the last minute after senators were told he had connections with \"pro-Russian people in Ukraine.\"\"Anybody who has tried to oppose the Democrats, including the President, has been called a Russian asset,\" Telizhenko said, denying the claim.Speaking to CNN before the decision to abandon the subpoena vote, Davidzon said he did not act on Telizhenko's offer, letting it go \"as elegantly as possible.\" But in late 2019 he shared what he knew with US authorities after Telizhenko made a series of public comments in support of Giuliani. With Telizhenko poised to provide evidence to the Senate, Davidzon decided to go public. \"This type of behaviour absolutely discredits any theories that Mr Telizhenko gives and makes me question his agenda,\" Davizdon said.\"The message was evidence to me that, aside from claiming to be a Ukrainian patriot, Mr Telizhenko was probably working for someone with pro-Russian interests at heart and not in Ukraine's national security interests,\" he said.Davidzon concedes $5,000 was not a lot of money for the request but says he believes the offer was serious and speculates that Telizhenko was \"likely making a lot more from whoever was paying him.\"He also claims Telizhenko presented himself to him on other occasions as a go-between for Dmitry Firtash, a Ukrainian oligarch facing charges of bribery in the United States. Firtash's legal team reportedly assisted Giuliani with his investigations into the Bidens and met with Giuliani's indicted emissaries to Ukraine, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. Firtash's lawyer declined to comment.In a set of private exchanges on Facebook dated June 2019, Davidzon asks whether Firtash will be extradited to the US and asks Telizhenko for an interview with him.Telizhenko replies, seemingly on Firtash's behalf, saying the case was \"still in process.\" \"No interviews now (...) he does not give to WSJ even so not for now,\" referring to the Wall Street Journal.Telizhenko told CNN he did not have any contacts with Firtash and had never worked for him.With Telizhenko now apparently out of the picture insofar as the Republican investigations are concerned, it's unclear what direction these probes will take. But with Biden's fortunes on the rise, it seems clear that efforts will continue to uncover information that could potentially derail his campaign.CNN's Jeremy Herb contributed reporting from Washington.",

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced that he is extending restrictions already in place in the north.\"All the measure of the red zones are now extended to all of the national territory,\" Conte said at a press conference on Monday evening as he also announced a ban on all public events.The Prime Minister said the move was taken in order to protect the population, and especially the most fragile individuals. His announcement came at the end of a chaotic day that saw prison riots across the country.Smoke billows from a rooftop of the Regina Coeli prison in central Rome on Monday.Ninety-seven people have died of the novel coronavirus since Sunday in Italy, bringing its total number of deaths to 463.

Travelers, including those departing or arriving in the containment regions by airplane, were to be checked to see whether they have a self-declared travel exemption.

Inmates overran a number of prisons on Monday, escaping their facilities and kidnapping officers, after visitors were banned in an effort to curb the spread of the virus, the Justice Ministry said in a statement. Multiple inmates have died in the uproar, which swept 22 prisons. Some continue to occupy their facilities, even reaching the roof in some cases.In the southern city of Foggia, inmates occupied the entire compound and 43 detainees escaped, before being captured by the prison's police force and other law enforcement agencies, the statement said. In Modena, in the north, inmates are \"still occupying two sections of the prison.\" There some inmates broke into the infirmary, where they got hold of various drugs, including methadone, the director of the Italian penitentiary system Francesco Basentini, said in a TV interview.Six inmates died there, he added. Two of the dead died of an overdose, and another from the inhalation of toxic smoke. Basentini said the cause of the three remaining deaths was under investigation.Meanwhile, in Rome's Rebibbia prison, inmates reached an external area and badly damaged an entire pavilion. And four prison officers were kidnapped in Bologna, where 350 inmates managed to occupy two sections of the facility. Almost all of the jails are \"seriously damaged,\" according to the ministry statement.Quarantine zone stretches across countryThere have been more than 108,000 confirmed cases and 3,821 deaths related to the novel coronavirus worldwide. Despite signs of improvement in Asia -- with China and South Korea recording a slowdown in the number of new cases -- the situation in Europe and North America appears to be worsening.

Anthony Lasarevitsch received seven years for fraud in an organized gang and criminal association. The pair will also have to pay 2 million euros and 1 million euros in fines respectively. The fraudsters tried to pull off what some in France are calling the scam of the century by impersonating Le Drian, Minister for Europe and foreign affairs, and conning wealthy individuals out of 80 million euros purportedly to help pay ransoms to free French hostages being held by Islamist terrorists.A third defendant, Sebastian Zawadzki, was sentenced in absentia to five years' imprisonment and handed a 1 million euro fine for acts of fraud in an organized gang. He remains at large but a warrant has been issued for his arrest.Victims thought they were paying millions to free hostages. But the 'minister' who asked them was a fraudster in a maskMeillet hailed the \"very heavy\" sentences.  Read More\"It is sending a strong message to our society, to those who would dare fraudulently use the state's attributes,\" she said in a statement.Chikli and Lasarevitsch were also ordered to pay damages to two high-profile victims: 44 million euros to Turkish tycoon Inan Kirac and 10.6 million euros to spiritual leader Aga Khan.The multi-million dollar con lasted two years and targeted more than 150 people, including the President of Niger, the Prime Minister of Norway, the Archbishop of Lyon, the owner of Chateau Margaux wines, the King of Belgium, the director general of UNESCO and numerous CEOs.Attempts to extort money from embassies and governments were made in more than 50 countries, according to French court documents.According to many of the victims, to earn their trust an initial phone call was followed up by a Skype video call. During this exchange, the con artist wore a custom-made silicone mask of Le Drian's face and sat in a replica of the minister's office complete with both the tricolor flag of France and a flag of Europe, pictures in the court documents show.The group also planned to impersonate Prince Albert II of Monaco, according to investigators who found pictures of a silicone mask of the monarch on Lasarevitsch's cell phone.",

People's health first and foremost has to be the priority,\" Simon Chadwick, professor of Eurasian Sport at Emlyon Business School based in Paris, told CNN Sport.\"We need a sense of balance and perspective in assessing why some sports are trying to continue as normal.\"Of course, there are some for whom money rather than morals and well being are important,\" added Chadwick, speaking generally about sport and not about any one single organization.\"However, sport is now a major global industry that sustains jobs and communities.

CNN has been unable to verify the recording.Vovan and Lexus claim to have previously duped other well-known politicians and celebrities, such as actor Joaquin Phoenix, singer Elton John and, more recently, US Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders.A recording of one of the calls was published on the pair's YouTube channel with an animation of Prince Harry and Thunberg, according to The Sun, which published that call. The recording has since been removed temporarily, the duo told CNN, due to an exclusive licensing agreement with The Sun.According to The Sun, Prince Harry also mentioned US President Donald Trump in one of the calls saying. \"I think the mere fact that Donald Trump is pushing the coal industry is so big in America, he has blood on his hands.\"Prince Harry apparently went on to tell the caller: \"Trump will want to meet you to make him look better but he won't want to have a discussion about climate change with you because you will outsmart him.\"Putin apologized for past pranksIn 2015, the duo convinced Elton John he was talking to Russian President Vladimir Putin about gay rights in Russia. The singer -- believing he was talking to the President via Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov, who was purportedly translating for the two -- said on the call that \"he was extremely honored\" and that \"it is a great privilege to speak to one of the most influential people in the whole world.\"According to Russian media, the real Putin later called Elton John and apologized for the prank and said the two were \"harmless.\"The pair have a history of pranking people perceived to be adversaries of Russia and notably do not target Russian officials. But they have denied accusations they are backed by the Kremlin and Russian intelligence services, blaming Russian opposition for peddling this narrative.\"This is a favorite pastime of both the Russian opposition and Ukrainian officials, they blame all of their failures on external factors, such as the FSB, the Kremlin and so on,\" Krasnov said in a BBC interview in 2016.Stolyarov added: \"We can responsibly declare, and we have always stated this, that we are not a project of special services, we ourselves are self-sufficient people, we have our own beliefs, our ideas and thoughts.\"Russian state TV has also favorably reported on the comedic pair, doing positive features about their work.CNN's Max Foster and journalist Darya Tarasova contributed to this story.",

He had to self-isolate at home in London for 14 days after returning from Seoul, where he went for surgery on a fractured arm last month.Son's compatriot, esports superstar \"Faker,\" has also made a charitable donation. After the virus caused disruptions to events that he was supposed to compete in, Faker -- whose real name is Lee Sang-hyeok -- donated about $25,000 to the Community Chest of Korea charity. \"I felt devastated for those that are working day and night to battle the Covid-19,\" the League of Legends icon said in his statement. \"I really wanted to aid those battling the outbreak and felt that donating to the Community Chest of Korea was the optimal choice. I hope that everyone bands together to overcome this terrible situation, and hope to see real support being given to those necessary.\"In addition, Faker's team SK Telecom 1 will donate all of their streaming proceeds this week to charities to \"help low-income families combat the novel coronavirus.\"\"Coronavirus has affected nearly every corner of the world and we want to do our small part to help the communities where we live and play,\" T1 CEO Joe Marsh said.READ: Pro sports leagues like the NBA and MLB will restrict locker room access indefinitely to combat coronavirusJuventus players celebrate after scoring against Inter Milan in an empty stadium. Making sacrificesIn Europe, Italy has been hardest hit, with the entire country put on lockdown, as the government tries to gain control of the spread.Italy has reported more than 9,000 infections and more than 630 deaths.All domestic sport in Italy has been suspended until April 3 although Italian clubs in UEFA competitions -- such as Juventus' Champions League tie against Lyon -- are still eligible to play matches behind closed doors. In response, 18-time top-flight champion AC Milan announced it would donate $284,000 (\u20ac250,000) to relief efforts tackling the virus, as well as reimbursing fans who were not able to attend games that took place behind closed doors.The donation goes to the Azienda Regionale Emergenza Urgenza, the emergency response arm of the Lombardy region's government.A general view of play in the empty stadium in Milan.\"There are things in life more important than football,\" Milan CEO Ivan Gazidis said in a statement. \"At a time when all of us need to take care of the most vulnerable amongst us, we must all act with the utmost responsibility and listen to the advice of the relevant authorities. \"We are all worried about those nearest and dearest to us and about the implications for the future.

Elsewhere in Italy, on what should have been one of the most historic nights in the club's history, fans of Atalanta announced that they would be making a donation of $45,000 (\u20ac40,000) to a northern Italian hospital.The team was playing the second leg of its first Champions League last 16 tie in its history in Valencia -- with a 4-1 lead -- but because of the virus, the game was played behind closed doors, meaning fans had to stay in Italy.

        "content": "(CNN)English rugby player Joe Marler has been handed a 10-week ban for grabbing an opponent's genitals.The incident occurred during the Six Nations match between England and Wales on Saturday when Marler squeezed the groin area of Welsh captain Alun Wyn Jones during a scuffle between opposing players.At disciplinary hearing in Dublin on Thursday, the Six Nations panel decided to punish Marler for his actions.\"The Disciplinary Committee found that the act of foul play warranted a low-end entry point (12 weeks' suspension) and reduced that by three weeks to take account of mitigating factors (including good character and remorse) but increased it by one week to take account of his most recent disciplinary record,\" said a statement on England's Rugby Football Union website.Marler is famous in rugby for highlighting the lighter side of the game; the Harlequins player has been caught on camera exchanging banter with referees and winding up opponents along with giving entertaining interviews.Read MoreThe 29-year-old Marler will be free to resume playing on Monday, June 8. He has the right to appeal the ban.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featuresJoe Marler has played over 60 times for England.After the match Jones, whose side was on the end of a 33-30 defeat at Twickenham, called for incidents such as this to be scrutinized more rigorously during games.\"Joe's a good bloke,\" he said.\"Lots of things happen on a rugby field. My question is, it's difficult as a captain these days because you can't speak to a ref about anything it feels. I look at the touch judge, obviously he didn't see what happened and that's fine.\"But there's a lot of footage that's been shown, obviously. It seems there's a lot of supporters that saw what happened. It's just very frustrating, the fact that we talk a lot about TMOs (television match officials) and footage review but there doesn't seem to be a lot of it happening (during the game).\"READ: Sports stars unite to support 'heroes' helping vulnerable in coronavirus fightControversyThe incident has divided opinion within the rugby world.Harlequins scrumhalf Danny Care has defended Marler, saying: \"I've lost count of the number of people who have touched my genitals in a game of rugby.\"Speaking to the Guardian, Care said he didn't \"see it as a big deal\" and suggested that the incident would not have been played up as much if Wales had won.\"Alun Wyn Jones's reaction after the game is probably a disappointed and angry Alun Wyn Jones, and that is a way to take a bit of that anger out,\" Care said.\"You could see there was no malice in it, it's a joke between two old teammates. \"I can understand why people have seen it the wrong way, you don't want to see kids seeing that. \"It was in a rugby environment and it happens a lot.\"Danny Care, who has played 84 times for England, defended his teammate.Marler hasn't spoken at length about the incident in public but, after many voiced their opposition to his actions, he tweeted: \"Bllocks. Complete bllocks.\" He later deleted the tweet.This isn't the first time an incident of this kind has occurred on the rugby field.Second-row George Robson was banned for six weeks for grabbing an opponent's testicles in 2016, while Samoa's James So'oialo was cleared of grabbing the testicles of Adriaan Strauss in 2013 after the act was deemed accidental.",

Like many people here, the Pope was shut away behind closed doors, but he asked priests to have the courage to visit those affected by coronavirus in his daily livestream from his private residence. A couple looks at the closed St. Peter's Square at the Vatican on Monday, after a decree ordering restrictions across Italy to beat the spread of the coronavirus.Lydia Carelli, a 26-year-old intern at the Italian Supreme Court in Rome, told CNN: \"This is the strangest situation that I've ever lived, these restrictions are similar to times of war.\"She said her family wanted her to return home to Naples, but she would \"rather not take any risks\" in case she had been exposed to the virus.Read More\"Everyone has to do their part,\" added Carelli, whose judiciary course has been suspended, with her classes taking place online. \"I do think all of this was necessary, people must follow the suspensions to respect all of the people that have died and continue to die.

There's nobody around. I feel for them. I feel that Italians are really, really struggling,\" he said.As a 6 p.m. curfew came into effect in Rome on Tuesday, the restaurants and bars that usually bring the city to life in the evenings were closed and only a few buses ran along their usual routes. There was a heavy police presence as people were seen walking along the streets, some going to supermarkets that remained open for people's daily needs. Food delivery app Deliveroo sent a message to subscribers titled \"Stay at home: Deliveroo is active,\" explaining it would continue to deliver meals from several restaurants after curfew. The Just Eat app also appeared to be taking orders from its usual restaurants.'People are not acting rationally'Filomena Gasparri, an 82-year-old retiree living in the mountains of Abruzzo, east of Rome, told CNN that everyone was feeling the \"tension.\" She added: \"I lived during World War II, I was a girl then, but this situation really shocked me because I have never seen anything like this.\"I'm anxious because I don't know when this will end, you aren't free to do anything that you want, you feel like a recluse.\"Her husband Emidio, 86, said it was right to bring in nationwide restrictions, including the closure of the ski resort in their town of Rivisondoli. \"They did well closing the ski resorts because it was becoming chaotic. The majority of people are not acting rationally. They search for refuge here, thinking that it [the coronavirus] would never arrive in the mountains.\"Some young people say we will be fine, this is just an illness for the elderly, but it's not this way.\"He said the virus was continuing to spread because of those who continued \"to hug and kiss and live as though nothing is happening.\"Italy has had more than 10,000 coronavirus cases and more than 600 deaths so far, a count second only to China, where the virus originated.Police officers and soldiers check passengers leaving from Milan's main train station after travel was canceled except for work and health reasons.Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced at a news conference on Monday evening that the \"red zone\" was expanding from northern Italy to the entire country. The worst-hit northern region of Lombardy was already struggling to function, with intensive care coordinator Antonio Pesenti warning that the region's normally robust healthcare system was \"one step from collapse.\"All across Italy, people are trying to negotiate the restrictions. In Sestri Levante, northern Italy, Alex Roggero, a photographer and author, was stranded while trying to reach his elderly parents who are ill and in quarantine. He told CNN: \"We are in complete lockdown. I can see a few people walking around but they are not supposed to.\"He said he was concerned about the virus spreading south, \"where things don't work as well,\" and said the government should have acted earlier to build hospitals.Employees of Turin's famed pastry shop \"Gerla\" wear respiratory masks while cooking.\"Europe isn't prepared,\" he said. \"Because we are a democracy, we cannot take the draconian measures the Chinese did.\"We Italians are hypochondriacs by nature.

Airports remain open, but several airlines have canceled flights to Italy.Smoke billows from a rooftop of the Regina Coeli prison in central Rome after protests in at least 22 prisons left 11 inmates dead.The restrictions came after a chaotic day that saw riots at 22 prisons across Italy, with 11 inmates killed, 50 escaping and guards kidnapped after visitors were banned in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. The justice minister said that three inmates found dead Tuesday morning in Rieti prison may have died after taking drugs stolen from the prison's pharmacy during Monday's riots.Europe imposes wider restrictionsItaly's measures represent the toughest coronavirus response implemented outside mainland China, but other countries are starting to follow suit.The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control confirmed that every European Union member state has cases as the EU Parliament announced it would cancel all non-core activities.Xi Jinping visits Wuhan, in major show of confidence as China turns corner on coronavirusParts of Spain entered a \"reinforced containment phase,\" which includes closing all schools, nurseries and universities for 15 days and advising against all but essential travel.Soccer leagues are being restricted across Europe.

Now with this new agreement we've taken a step forward in that regard, that players feel secure and, above all, valued for what they are doing as their job.\"The association of clubs (ACFF) and several players' unions had been locked in negotiations over the league's collective bargaining agreement for almost 18 months, until an agreement was finally reached at the end of February.Much of the delay was down to the ACFF refusing to meet the wage demands for part-time players, which it proposed should have been \u20ac8,000 ($9,000) instead of the \u20ac12,000 ($13,600) that was eventually agreed on.The stall in negotiations forced the players to take drastic action. In November, the footballers boycotted all eight first division matches during one gameweek, after 189 representatives from the league's 16 clubs voted 93% in favor of taking strike action.\"We all know well that when the population mobilizes is when people realize that things need to change,\" Corredera says. \"We had been asking for this agreement for some time, for them to confirm it and come to an agreement.

We showed that strength of everyone together and being united was what helped open people's eyes and show that we were serious, that really wanted this agreement and would do everything we possibly could to achieve it.\"The strike convinced the clubs to reopen negotiations as they successfully sought funding from the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) -- which pays clubs \u20ac350,000 ($397,000) per season -- and through a television rights deal to meet the players' demands.Closing the gapFor Corredera, the new deal caps off a startling rise for Spanish women's football, both domestically and internationally.The versatile winger left Spain in 2015 to play for Arsenal in the Women's Super League and won both the FA Cup and WSL Cup during her time in England.France's top tier is widely considered the best in Europe, though arguably the talent is far more concentrated at the top of the division compared to larger spread in England's WSL.Lyon has dominated the Champions League in recent seasons, winning the last four editions, while French clubs have made up five of the last eight finalists.However, Spain had its breakthrough year in the competition last season as Barcelona became the first Spanish club in Champions League history to reach either the semifinals or the final.Barcelona became the first Spanish team to reach either the semifinal or final or the Champions League.Though Barcelona eventually lost 4-1 to Lyon, Correrdera believes it's evidence that the gap is closing between Spain and its rival European leagues; indeed, the country is guaranteed another semifinalist with Barca and Atletico Madrid facing off in this season's quarterfinals.\"It's completely different now than it was before,\" she says of the league's quality. \"Above all, the level of the players, the level of the matches have increased a lot. \"The matches are a lot more difficult to win because the level of the players has grown. This is down to the fact they are training a lot better, there are trainers, fitness coaches that are more prepared, that understand and work with the female body because we are different (to men). \"Thanks to the clubs, the federation, our whole environment, we're improving. Television is supporting us a lot more and people see us more in their homes, people go to games more. We're more visible and started to have more significance in society.\"We all know that those leagues have been working for many years on a good trajectory and that gives them an advantage over us, but I think we're getting closer to those countries and leagues because here in Spain we're working really well. \"That's cut the distance, we need to carry on like this and the generations that are coming up are also making their mark and I think that will help us achieve success in the present or near future.\"Corredera has lofty ambitions this season both at club and international level.Her Levante side, which she says has the perfect blend of youth and experience, sits in third place in the league -- just five points behind Atletico Madrid in second -- and is dreaming of qualifying for the Champions League for the first time since 2009. Marta Corredera goes past the USWNT's Megan Rapinoe during the She Believes Cup clash.Corredera was part of the Spain squad at last summer's Women's World Cup that made history with the country's first ever appearance in the knockout stages.The national team has since gone from strength to strength and earned an invitation to this year's She Believes Cup, the annual four-team tournament held in the United States.Spain secured an impressive 3-1 against Japan in the opening match, totally dominating the 2011 World Cup winner, before narrowly losing 1-0 to reigning world champion the USWNT.Corredera and her teammates go into Wednesday's deciding matches with an outside chance of winning the title; they'll need to secure victory against a strong England team and hope that Japan can upset the US.\"The She Believes Cup is a tournament we've always watched from a distance and now we have the luck to be able to enjoy it ourselves,\" she says. \"We need to try to learn and above all enjoy the experience, compete at our maximum and achieve good results because I think this team is capable of doing that.\"",

They pointed out the current medical advice claims you would need to be within 2 meters of someone carrying the infection, which Johnson at no point was. Health officials are now racing to trace those who have had contact with Dorries, who has kept a busy diary of engagements in and around the UK's political center.\"I can confirm I have tested positive for Coronavirus,\" Dorries, a junior health minister, said in a statement released through the Department of Health. \"As soon as I was informed I took all the advised precautions and have been self-isolating at home.\"Read More\"It's been pretty rubbish but I hope I'm over the worst of it now,\" Dorries added on Twitter. \"More worried about my 84yo mum who is staying with me and began with the cough today.

Watford's Christian Kabasele reveals allAtletico Madrid celebrate Marcos Llorente's second goal.Pantomime villainThere would have been more than a few hearts in mouths inside the opening 20 seconds at Anfield, as Joao Felix's slick turn and pass set Diego Costa through on goal.The Spanish striker, a familiar foe for Liverpool from his time at Chelsea, could only skew his shot into the side netting but it was an early reminder for Liverpool of the quality that Atletico Madrid possesses going forward.Costa was soon slipping into his preferred role of pantomime villain, petulantly throwing the ball away as Liverpool goalkeeper Adrian attempted to take a quick free-kick.It was a tactic Atletico had been expected to employ in an attempt to frustrate both the Liverpool fans and players into submission and reduce the game to a scrappy affair.They succeeded in doing exactly that but Liverpool was giving as good as it was getting, ferociously snapping into tackles with From the outset, Anfield wasn't quite at its famous levels of noise -- perhaps the torrential rain had dampened the atmosphere somewhat -- but Wijnaldum's stinging strike, palmed away brilliantly by Jan Oblak, was enough to spark the crowd into life.Georginio Wijnaldum celebrates his opening goal.As had been expected, Liverpool dominated possession inside the opening 30 minutes but, Wijnaldum's effort aside, hadn't troubled Atletico's back line.Diego Simeone's side is widely considered the best defensive unit in European football and as Liverpool's attacks were repelled again and again, it sometimes felt as though it was crossing balls into a brick wall.But Liverpool's pressure eventually started to tell and a few of those bricks started coming loose; Wijnaldum once again tested Oblak before he eventually found a way through.Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross found the Dutchman totally unmarked in the middle of the penalty area and he directed his header down into the wet turf and into the top corner.Wijnaldum is making a habit of scoring big goals for Liverpool in the Champions League; last season, he scored a brace to haul Liverpool level in that famous semifinal comeback win against Barcelona.Anfield roared into life and Atletico's players spent the remaining two minutes of the first half desperately waiting for the half-time whistle to blow.Backs to the wallThose 15 minutes respite changed very little and Atleti's players were back out in the second half and immediately had their backs to the wall.Again they had Oblak to thank for keeping them level in the tie, as the Slovenian stopper did brilliantly to save efforts from Oxlande-Chamberlain and Roberto Firmino. But midway through the second half, Liverpool was given a sharp warning of how quickly this tie could change.Felix, Atletico's $142 million star signing, managed to wriggle free on the edge of the area and his deflected effort brought an awkward save out of Adrian.Liverpool's stand-in keeper should have dealt with the effort comfortably but presented Angel Correa with an opportunity from his weak parry, though he did eventually manage to smother the ball.With little more than 20 minutes remaining, the whole of Anfield thought Liverpool had found the tie-winning goal.Marcos Llorente celebrates his second goal in extra time.After ricocheting around in the box, the ball found its way to Andy Robertson at the far post but Kieran Trippier did brilliantly to get a slight touch on the header and deflect it onto the crossbar.In the dying seconds, totally against the run of play, Atleti thought it had found the winner.Renan Lodi's free-kick into the box was met by Saul Niguez's thumping header into the top corner. The 3,000 Atletico fans behind that goal went wild, as did the entire Atleti bench, but their celebrations were cut short by the linesman's flag for an obvious offside.30 minutes of madnessExtra time started at a blistering pace and Firmino, with his first Anfield goal all season, looked to have secured passage through to the quarterfinals, reacting fastest after his header had hit the post to stab the rebound home.But then it was the turn of Adrian to take center stage, the player called upon the least throughout the 90 minutes and as much of a spectator as the 60,000 fans inside Anfield.The Spaniard's scuffed clearance gifted the ball to substitute Llorente, who did brilliantly to bend the ball into the vacant far corner of the goal.Then, just like that, it was two. Some lazy defending from both Joe Gomez and Virgil van Dijk gifted Llorente with space on the edge of the area and he curled another unerring strike into the bottom corner.Anfield was silent, save for the small pocket of delirious Atletico fans at the opposite end of the stadium. With seconds remaining, Alvaro Morata popped up to score Atelti's third and emphatically seal passage through to the quarterfinals.There were tears from both sets of fans at full-time, only they were very different types of tears.",

He first visited a racetrack at the age of 10 and from that moment Fleming knew a career in racing was something he wanted to pursue.

The pot is split across 14 races over two days of world class competition, climaxing in the Breeders' Cup Classic -- a one-and-a-quarter-mile dirt dash which often decides the very best of a generation.The Classic has been won in recent years by star names such as Accelerate, Gun Runner, Arrogate and 2015 Triple Crown winner American Pharoah with the 2020 showpiece now worth $7 million, up from $6 million in 2019. Prize money in the sport is currently skyrocketing, notably with the recent addition of the world's most expensive race -- the Saudi Cup. \"We don't actually view it as competition.,\" said Fleming. \"We like to increase purses to give back to the owners and breeders that help fund the Breeders' Cup.\"We're also very excited to see other racing festivals around the world increase their purses and we view it as an overall team game and an increase in the strength of the business as a whole.\" READ: Superstar trio share Longines best racehorse award Photos: Stunning shots from horse racing's photographer of the yearMulti award-winning snapper Edward Whitaker was named horse racing's photographer of the year for his portfolio of six stunning pictures.

        "content": "(CNN)The whole of Italy has been put on lockdown, as the government desperately tries to gain control of the coronavirus spread.On Tuesday, thriving cities like Rome, Milan and Venice became ghost towns. Italians are facing a new reality of life with a curfew, travel restrictions and enforced space between people in public places, as the country reports more than 9,000 infections and more than 630 deaths.CNN spoke to Beniamino Pagliaro, a journalist for national newspaper la Repubblica, who described the measures as unprecedented. What are you seeing on the streets? I'm in Rome, and the streets are basically empty. Rome is pretty famous for traffic jams, but there are none at the moment, there is very little traffic. Read MoreLike in many offices, most people (at Repubblica) are working from home. Many of our colleagues have children and schools are closed. People were told to work from home for health reasons first, but there just isn't anywhere for children to go. I live in the Trastevere, and there is a joke about the area, that one in two people are tourists. On a normal day, you can hear lots of people talking in English or Russian. These days, you don't see tourists at all.In the past week, I've been to Milan, and also there you can feel the city is half-closed. Restaurants are empty.But don't get me wrong, I think the government was right to choose these rules.Journalist Beniamino Pagliaro warns other countries may face a similar situation to Italy's soon. How are people responding to the measures?They are listening. If you watch how less crowded the cities are, you can tell that something has changed,Most people are trying to cancel travel. Many friends are canceling trips back to their families' homes. Some friends of mine who live in Rome or Milan, they often go home to stay with family, but their parents are older, so they're canceling because the risk is higher for older people. Italy suspends all domestic sport competitions in bid to curb coronavirusPeople are communicating a lot on social media, sharing what TV shows they're watching, what books they're reading. People are mostly staying at home with their children. They can go for a run outside while gyms are closed, and some people are meeting in small groups.I'm not proud to say this, but when (Prime Minister) Conte announced the new measures -- the lockdown of the entire country, bringing the whole country to the same level as Lombardy --  at that moment, some people panicked and there were hundreds of people running to supermarkets in the night to buy things. I'm afraid we are still very irrational in these kind of things.But this happens in London, Berlin and New York, it's not just Italians.What is it like looking from the inside to the outer world?This is a really tough situation. I wrote a story this morning about how it's very worrying and scary to me, that most capitals around the world seem not to have understood how deep a change we need.Is it safe for travelers to visit Italy?Reading news of the UK and United States, what they are doing is what we were doing two weeks ago. The pattern is very, very clear, like you are in denial because you think you can act in another way, but then facts and scientists tell us the only way is to slow down -- you cant stop it -- but slowing down the virus will mean a lot less problems in your hospitals.In Italy, we were lucky to experience the outbreak in an area with plenty of hospitals like Milan, because if you had this spread of the virus in southern Italy, for example, it really could be a mess.I know that some parts of the UK and some parts of the US especially are not very well-equipped. In the US, there's also a known situation about healthcare costs.How do you describe this moment?So it's a tough moment but also it may force everyone to do the right thing. Of course, it could be boring to postpone events or travel, but then the good thing in this spread of the virus is that people will understand that we are used to thinking about ourselves. While this spread is happening, it's very clear we are not alone, and so you have to think about the whole of society. If you put together all the populist movements in the recent years, it was all about \"me wanting this\" and \"me wanting that.\" British people who want to be isolated, or to remain -- this makes very clear that the world we live in, we cannot just count just on ourselves, we are together.This interview has been edited for clarity.",

        "content": "(CNN)Outplayed, outgunned and outcoached, Jose Mourinho was powerless to stop his Totttenham side suffering a Champions League exit at the hands of RB Leipzig.Mourinho lamented his injury crisis after the first leg, describing the defeat as going into \"a gunfight without bullets.\"On Tuesday, Mourinho didn't even have the luxury of turning up to the second leg with an empty gun.Leipzig was again totally dominant for 90 minutes, only this time it took advantage with two early goals to seal a 3-0 win courtesy of captain Marcel Sabitzer's brace and Emil Forsberg late strike.With just two draws and four defeats from his last six matches, Mourinho is currently suffering the longest winless streak of his 935-match managerial career and is without a win in the Champions League knockout stages for six years.Read More\"I was very positive yesterday and that's the way I have to be all the time, if I'm not positive it's better not to come to the game,\" a philosophical Mourinho told BT Sport after the match. \"Yes I'm positive, I motivate the players and yes we all believed but we know that in this moment (with injuries) it's all very difficult.Jose Mourinho was powerless to prevent his Tottenham side crashing out of Europe.\"They are a very, very strong side ... and after our first couple of mistakes they score and the game of course is very, very difficult. They deserved to go through, they were the best team. If I can be critical, I keep it for us. Sometimes difficult moments are moments that can prepare the future in a better way. \"Of course there is nobody to blame when it looks like we have a traumatic injury and every traumatic injury ends with months and months (out). It's very hard and the players they gave everything. People can say 'excuses' but I'm pretty sure it's bad for anyone and I don't think anyone would resist to such a situation.\"Tottenham was lucky to come away from that first leg just one goal behind after RB Leipzig dominated for the vast majority of the match.Aside from a late flurry of attacks in the closing stages, Spurs spent most of the game on the back foot -- but the opening 10 minutes of the second leg very much reflected the closing 10 minutes of the first.Mourinho appeared to set out his side in far more attacking fashion; the forward trio of Erik Lamelo, Dele Alli and Lucas Moura were snapping at the heels of Leipzig's defenders and looked lively every time they streamed forward.However, Julian Nagelsmann's Leipzig is a sight to behold when attacking at full tilt, and in the blink of an eye had turned defense into attack to double its advantage on aggregate.On a trademark blistering counterattack, Leipzig's first of the match, star striker Timo Werner reacted quickest to his blocked shot and laid the loose ball off to Sabitzer on the edge of the area.The captain hit a low first time shot that Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris got a hand to but couldn't keep out.Marcel Sabitzer celebrates after scoring his opening goal.And if there were question marks over Lloris failed attempt at a save for the first goal, alarm bells were ringing for the second.It was Sabitzer again with the goal, turning Angelino's cross in at the near post with his head. Lloris was once again well positioned and got a strong hand to the ball, but once again failed to prevent the goal.Deja vu?Given the Spurs now needed three away goals to progress to the next round, it would seem remiss to not talk about last season's comeback from the same position against Ajax in the semifinals.On that famous night in Amsterdam, Tottenham did indeed find the three second-half goals it needed to progress to the final, though any lingering hopes of deja vu in Leipzig were quickly dispelled in the second half.The host was utterly dominant, sucking the life out of what were now weary Tottenham legs and tired heads.Leipzig did eventually put the Spurs out of its misery with just three minutes remaining, as Forsberg reacted first to a loose ball and poked home with his first touch since coming on as a substitute just seconds earlier. For a club playing in the Champions League knockout stages for the first time in its history, Leipzig already looks well and truly at home.Seven goals, no fansIn the night's other match, Valencia and Atalanta shared seven goals between them -- and 12 overall on aggregate -- but sadly there were no fans to witness it.Last week, it was announced that the match would be played behind closed doors due to the coronavirus outbreak, as Spain's health ministry said it wanted to avoid \"large gatherings of fans.\"Valencia and Atalanta played their match in front of empty stands.Leading 4-1 from the first leg, Atalanta -- appearing in the Champions League for the first time in its history -- scored an early opening goal through Josip Ilicic's penalty to end the game as a contest, but it certainly didn't end it as a spectacle.When Kevin Gameiro equalized on the night for the host, there was an audible roar from the Valencia fans that were gathered outside the stadium to watch the match.In fairness to the stadium announcer, he lacked no enthusiasm when announcing Gameiro as the goalscorer over the speaker system.Another five goals were scored, including a hat-trick for Ilicic, as Atalanta ran out 4-3 winner on the night and 8-4 on aggregate.",

Letter before International Women's DayCordeiro's letter said that US Soccer had made multiple attempts to meet with the women's national team but those advances were declined on the basis that they hadn't agreed to make up the difference in prize money awarded to men and women for past and future World Cups. US Soccer said the cost of paying the difference for the previous two tournaments -- which the women's team has won -- would be more than $66 million, and said the prize purses are determined by world football's governing body FIFA. \"It is not reasonable or fiscally sound for U.S. Soccer to make up the gap,\" Cordeiro wrote. \"It would seriously impair our ability to support our mission and invest in these other critical developmental areas.\"However, a statement from Molly Levinson, a spokeswoman for the USWNT players, said the letter was \"riddled with falsehoods.\"Levinson said the latest USSF's proposal did not offer equal pay for friendlies for the majority of players and accused it of employing \"dishonest tactics\" by leaking private conversations to the media. \"The timing of yet another misleading statement from USSF is clear,\" read the statement, released on Saturday.\"The players will focus on leaving it all on the field tomorrow for the SheBelieves cup -- a tournament that in USSF's words \"celebrates the hopes and dreams of women and girls.\"READ: Megan Rapinoe praises Raheem Sterling, 'Blue Girl' in FIFA award speechUSWNT celebrate with the trophy after winning the 2019 Womens World Cup.'I don't think we're anywhere close'Members of the USWNT filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against the USSF last year, with the trial set to go ahead in early May.

        "content": "London (CNN)International attempts to contain the novel coronavirus are stretching the capability and patience of the international community, as trade, travel and business as usual continue to suffer. The crisis has already passed the point of no return. If and when the spread slows, some of the world's most powerful will have to answer serious questions about how societies, economies and global structures currently operate and how sustainable our way of life really is.Governments are announcing policies to stop the spread and soften the financial impact on companies and workers. However, the global response has thus far ignored how the outbreak will affect a group of people who over the past decade have become an essential cornerstone of urban life: gig workers.'This is a crisis.' Airlines face $113 billion hit from the coronavirusKyle, who declined to give his last name in order to maintain his professional privacy, is a driver who has worked for Uber and Lyft. He told CNN: \"I'm worried but I think that it's somewhat unavoidable at this point, unless you stay home and refuse to interact with any other humans.\"The problem is, people who work in the gig economy seldom enjoy the workplace benefits of those who work in more traditional salaried jobs. And many of these gig workers may soon have to make a choice: self-isolate to stop the spread and not be paid, or ignore public health warnings and carry on working even if they have symptoms of the virus.Read MoreThe gig worker problem came into focus in the UK earlier this week. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Wednesday that anyone with symptoms should \"self-isolate.\" He said \"nobody should be penalized for doing the right thing,\" and that workers would be financially compensated in full for the time they take off work. However, trade union groups have pointed out that this plan doesn't support people working in the gig economy, which is responsible for a significant chunk of the UK's jobs growth over the past decade. Self-isolating or paying the billsTo understand the scale of the problem in the UK, a study last year revealed that as many as one in 10 working-age adults had participated in \"platform work\" -- a term used to describe gig work found via apps, or platforms. The report also claimed that over a quarter of the population had attempted to find work via apps associated with the gig economy. Aidan Harper, a researcher at the New Economics Foundation, explains: \"People are being forced to register as self-employed workers ...  It takes away a lot of responsibilities that an employer would otherwise have to had to give you -- and that includes sick pay.\" Which, Harper adds, puts these workers in a position of having to decide whether or not to follow public health advice: \"You're making the choice between self-isolating and going into debt and missing paying bills.\"Gig economy platforms have introduced policies around sick pay in the UK. Most notably, Uber last year announced that workers would be able to claim sick pay and maternity pay. However, critics have pointed out that the pay only kicks in after a certain number of days off and is capped.

Perera believes that the gig economy boom has also had a profound effect on consumer culture. \"It has normalized low protections, low wages for workers.\" He says that it's made consumers come to expect \"that they can get a takeaway or a taxi whenever and not think about the implications for workers.\" Scott Schieman, professor of sociology at the University of Toronto, explains this heightened consumer expectation has happened at the same time as \"a capacity for preferences,\" where users can evaluate the performance of a worker",

Read MoreREAD: Confusion as sports minister calls for Serie A suspension amid coronavirus outbreakStriker Anthony Martial scores the opening goal for Manchester United.Clever free kick As has often been the case since his arrival from Sporting Lisbon in January, Fernandes was in great form and looked a constant threat throughout the match.It was his quick thinking that released Martial for the first goal, clipping a free kick to the Frenchman whilst the rest of the stadium expected a cross into the box. \"I've seen him to do it before,\" United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer told Sky Sports after the match.As the rain poured down at Old Trafford, United fans were busy celebrating their third win over their city rivals this season. It was the first time in a decade that Manchester United had completed a league double over the blue half of Manchester. The result is yet another sign that things are beginning to look brighter at Old Trafford, with the side now without a loss in 10 matches \u2014 winning seven and drawing three. In truth, Pep Guardiola's side were uncharacteristically sloppy in possession and were too often second best to their hungry hosts. Guardiola, who had praised his rivals for their aggression ahead of the highly anticipated derby, cut a frustrated figure on the sidelines. In stark comparison, his opposite number was beaming when the referee blew the final whistle, having watched his side execute his counterattacking plan to a tee. \"The desire, attitude, commitment, connection between fans and players pleased me most,\" Solskjaer said.\"It is a privilege to be a manager of a squad with this attitude. You can't ask for more. They are going to improve as players as well.\"READ: Soccer clash in Germany draws full stadium, despite nearby coronavirus outbreakCity manager Pep Guardiola displays his frustration during the Manchester derby on Sunday.Sloppy CityEderson certainly could have done better with the opening goal, letting Martial's effort squeeze under his body.The keeper was then at fault for the second, throwing the ball straight out to the feet of McTominay, who duly obliged in passing his effort into the open goal. City striker Sergio Aguero did have a goal rightly ruled out for offside but with nothing really left to play for in the league, City looked a pale shadow of themselves. The absence of star midfielder Kevin De Bruyne was certainly felt from a City perspective, with the midfield crying out for a bit of quality on a number of occasions. \"We played good, we missed a little in the final third, but the second half was better, and it was a good performance,\" a spiky Guardiola told Sky Sports. \"We play the same way, tried the press and defend well and we did well.\" City won't have long to lick their wounds with a Premier League match against Arsenal on Wednesday before hosting Burnley on Saturday. Meanwhile, United travel to Austria for its Europa League round of 16 tie against LASK on Thursday.",

        "content": "(CNN)Italy has imposed the most draconian lockdown outside mainland China as it attempts to control Europe's biggest outbreak of the novel coronavirus, restricting the movements of more than 10 million people in the northern part of the country.Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte signed a decree early Sunday, placing travel restrictions on the entire Lombardy region and 14 other provinces.How religious communities are modifying traditions to prevent coronavirus spreadLocations affected by the lockdown include the financial hub Milan and the tourist destination of Venice and are subject to strict measures, including the closure of schools and universities and the cancellations of all public events, sports events and civil and religious ceremonies.People who do not adhere to the restrictions, which are in place until April 3, will face up to three months in prison and a fine of 206 euros ($232). A woman walks in the almost deserted Central Station in Milan on Sunday after the lockdown was imposed overnight.  But questions remain as to how it will be enforced as trains and planes continued to go to and from Milan as scheduled on Sunday.Read More\"There will be an obligation to avoid any movement of people,\" Conte said Sunday as he announced the new measures. \"And even within the areas, moving around will occur only for essential work or health reasons.\"He added, \"We understand that these measures will impose sacrifices, sometimes small and sometimes very big. But this is a time where we must take responsibility. ... We need to understand that all of us need to adhere to the measures.\"Restrictions have also been imposed throughout the rest of Italy, including the suspension of events at cinemas, theaters, museums and sports arenas. Schools and university classes will be suspended until March 15, and bars, restaurants and shops must observe a one-meter (3-foot) distance between patrons. The sweeping move came after the country saw a dramatic spike of 1,247 confirmed cases on Saturday, the Civil Protection Department said in a statement. Also, the president of the Italian region of Piedmont -- which is not under lockdown -- said Sunday that he tested positive for the virus. Alberto Cirio announced on a Facebook that he was in Rome last Wednesday for a meeting of Italian regions to discuss the outbreak. Cirio tested himself as a precaution after Nicola Zingaretti, the head of the Lazio region, got a positive result for the virus. As of Sunday evening, Italy has recorded 7,375 cases and 366 deaths, the most fatalities outside mainland China. The restrictions could take a toll on Italy's already fragile economy. The Pope gave a prayer via livestream As the extraordinary response to the coronavirus affects almost every aspect of Italian life, Pope Francis delivered a livestream prayer from the Vatican.He began his address saying that it was quite unusual for the Pope to be \"locked away.\"  \"We do this so that the close concentration of people won't spread the virus,\" he said via video, before praying for those suffering from the virus and those who are assisting them. After the prayer, he appeared briefly at a window overlooking an almost empty St. Peter's Square for a weekly Sunday greeting to pilgrims.  The Pope's prayer was livestreamed in St. Peter's Square.Vatican City reported its first coronavirus case on Friday, but the Vatican dispelled reports that Pope Francis had been tested for the virus, saying he only had a cold. Meanwhile, churches in many cities in the north of Italy -- including Bologna, Turin and Venice -- suspended their Ash Wednesday services, with some offering Masses online or on local television.Friar Alberto Grandi, who lives in the town of Casalpusterlengo in the Lombardy region, has been in quarantine in the \"red zone\" with a fever. Yet he remains in high spirits. A square in Milan is nearly empty as people observe the restrictions.During a video call with Friar Marcello Longhi and CNN in Milan, Grandi said the lockdown could lead to more babies being conceived as couples stay at home. As the lockdown began, many Italians were confused about what it would entail or whether they could return home. Michele De Marsico told CNN at a Milan train station Sunday that he was trying to figure out how to return to southern Italy. \"I was worried, so I came here to the train station to check out the situation,\" the 55-year-old told CNN. The restrictions could take a toll on Italy's already fragile economy. At the end of February, Italian tourism representatives issued a news release warning that 200 million euros ($260 million) in bookings had been canceled for March since the outbreak was first announced.Hotel worker Alice Baldisserri, 38, told CNN that \"Milan's hotels are empty, so the jobs are at risk.\" Baldisserri said Italy's tourism industry has clearly been \"hit the hardest\" by the outbreak. The hotel she works at is closed, she said, and she said she has no idea when it will be able to reopen.CNN's Tara John wrote from London and Ben Wedeman reported from Milan, Italy.

He sold almost as many masks, rations, radios and water filters in February as he did in six months last year, and people he hasn't spoken to in years have been messaging him to request supplies. Lincoln Miles owns a preppers' store, which sells survival equipment including hazmat suits, gas masks and crossbows. At home, the 29-year-old has rations for two or three months, about 84 liters of water, blankets, candles, live chickens, spare oil for his car, a first-aid kit and a BOB (or portable survival kit) packed with a flashlight and freeze-dried food.\"If you prep it now and have food in the house for a month and it isn't the coronavirus, maybe in a few years you'll need it for another scenario, so it's never a bad idea to take some precautions,\" he said. \"I don't want to be dependent on anybody, I want to take care of myself.\"You store it in your house and then you just get on with living your life.\"Knobben does not believe in a \"post-apocalyptic movie scenario\" and avoids the more extreme Doomsday preppers and their online forums. \"I've been there, in the first year I started the web shop and I also got kind of sucked in with it, I was checking it every day. I was like, 'Oh yeah, that can happen, that can happen, we also need to prepare for that.'         View this post on Instagram           The past 2 days have been madness with our summer sale! Potentially going to be our biggest week ever! Two separate batches of Royal Mail leaving us today.... have you shopped our massive sale yet? A post shared by  Preppers Shop UK (@preppersshopuk) on Jul 18, 2019 at 12:18pm PDT\n\"It didn't make me a happier person being there every day and doing that every day and I still really support the need for prepping and why people need to prep, I think it's really important but I don't think it's -- I would advise against it to go on the internet every day and see all the conspiracies. It's a big rabbit hole and once you go down it, I don't think your life will be better for it.\"Lincoln Miles, who runs a UK preppers outlet, told CNN via email that things had been \"beyond manic\" following the virus outbreak in December. Sales are 20 times higher than usual, he says, and he has hired extra staff who are working into the night seven days a week to keep up with demand.\"The bestsellers are, of course, gas masks, hazmat suits and accessories,\" said Miles, whose store also sells crossbows, axes and knives. He is selling 600-700 military-spec masks, almost 1,000 filters and hundreds of hazmat suits every day, and sold 6,000 20-day rations packs in five hours last week.Anxious Brits have bought hundreds of food-prepper 'Brexit Boxes'His suppliers are \"so overwhelmed that available stock is becoming almost non-existent,\" Miles added. A 2019 study published in the Journal of Marketing Management found that prepping is on the rise as the Doomsday Clock -- a symbol of our risk of obliterating human civilization -- is inching precariously close to midnight. The researchers concluded that \"prepping is not a marginal subculture, but an increasingly mainstream phenomenon, driven not by delusional certainty, but a precautionary response to a generalized anxiety people have around permanent crisis.\"Co-author Sarah Browne, assistant professor in marketing and strategy at Trinity College Dublin, told CNN that preppers felt they were portrayed as \"silly\" or \"paranoid,\" and wanted to show they were \"logical and practical while non-preppers are naive and ill-prepared.\"She said preppers do not see crises such as the coronavirus as \"a temporary breakdown in otherwise functioning system\" but as evidence of a \"large-scale problem.\"Browne said most preppers first adopted the lifestyle because of a traumatic event such as financial collapse or losing a job. \"It'll be interesting to see if the virus scare on this level could trigger some people to change their consumption and lose trust in the market system,\" she said.Edward O'Toole, a British author, has been prepping since he lived off-grid with his parents as a child and now lives in a north-eastern Slovakian village where it is a way of life. Residents grow and preserve their own food for winter, when there are often blackouts or water shortages.\"You don't want to have to be reliant on someone else for providing your food or water or electricity,\" he said. \"There is a very logical side of things, not a Doomsday scenario where we need to stock up on weaponry.\"Edward O'Toole is a British author living in Slovakia who has been prepping for emergencies for years.O'Toole collects wood for fuel, stocks up on canned food and water purification tablets and has what preppers call an EDC (\"every day carry\") pouch equipped with a multi-tool, flashlight and first-aid kit.As the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread around the world, O'Toole thinks this will make prepping more and more popular. \"It's a wake-up call to people not to be so laissez-faire,\" he said.\"People have sort of removed themselves slightly from reality compared to the 1950s (and) 1960s ... I think this will teach people to start having something in reserve just in case.\"He said prepping is not about stockpiling expensive survival products you don't know how to use, but about acting as a community. \"Western society has become very isolationist, especially now we have an internet-based generation ... you don't have to go out to meet your neighbor.The writer says that there's a much stronger community spirit among people who are able to look after their own things first, then provide for others. \"In a flood, someone with a canoe could go out bring food to the grandfather down the road,\" he added.\"If the community is stronger and the members are more self-reliant, then you can help others, you don't have to be a burden.\"",

But despite being 22 points clear at the top of the league, after suffering back-to-back defeats, the tension among the Anfield faithful was palpable. That only got worse as Wilson gave Bournemouth a surprise lead with a controversial goal. The striker appeared to push defender Joe Gomez in the buildup before latching onto Jefferson Lerma's low cross to open the scoring. The lead didn't last long. After Bournemouth captain Steve Cook was forced off because of an injury, his replacement Simpson was dispossessed by Mane deep into his own half and Salah coolly slotted home on his 100th appearance for the club. And they were soon ahead, Mane latching onto a perfectly placed Virgil van Dijk pass, his 70th Premier League goal for Liverpool on his 100th appearance for the club. The Reds still needed a remarkable goal line clearance from James Milner in the final few minutes to hold on as Bournemouth went looking for an equalizer. If Manchester City lose the next three games against Manchester United, Arsenal and Burnley, Liverpool could be champions by the time it plays Everton in the league on March 16. The result means Bournemouth remains in the relegation zone, level on points with Watford and West Ham with a worse goal difference.

        "content": "(CNN)As recently evidenced by Inter Milan's eerie Europa League clash against Ludogorets in an empty San Siro, sport without fans is no spectacle at all -- but it could become the new normal in Italy over the next few months as the country grapples with the novel coronavirus outbreak.Inter president Steven Zhang says he is confident the Serie A season can be finished, even if it means playing matches behind closed doors.Italy is battling Europe's largest outbreak of the virus with more than 3,800 cases and almost 150 deaths, leading Italian authorities to cancel several top-flight matches, including Inter's top-of-the-table clash against Juventus which was called off last weekend.\"Public health is the most important thing,\" Zhang told CNN's Alex Thomas at the FT Business of Football Summit in London. \"That's why I think in order to make sure everyone is on the same page, everyone is taking the necessary action, protecting the ones around them.\"Obviously with the fans in the stadium, the matches will be more exciting. It's part of the experience of football. However, as we said many times, as a football organization, as a sport, or sport organization it will have big impact in society, its important that we always put safety and public health first.

We are taking the right steps from today.Steven Zhang was critical of Serie A's handling of the schedule following the coronavirus outbreak.\"For the public it is not a very good condition. I think overall it's a difficult moment, a difficult situation for all the clubs, all the companies but as we see the improvements that they are trying to make and the recognition from the world health department (WHO), if we are taking the necessary step, sooner or later the situation will be improved. \"So I'm not too worried about it and at the same time I think its not necessary to have too much panic, as people are working and living everyday in the city around their families, they have to always look to do the necessary steps.\"Title raceFrom a sporting perspective, the disruption has come at the worst possible time for Serie A.The league is witnessing a thrilling title race between Inter, Juventus and Lazio as the Milan and Rome clubs bid to end Juve's eight-year stranglehold on the Scudetto.However, should Inter reach the finals of the Coppa Italia and Europa League, Antonio Conte's side faces the prospect of playing 23 games in 12 weeks which could severely hinder its chances of a first Serie A title since 2010.And with Juventus also competing in the Coppa and Champions League, that could hand the advantage to Lazio in the race for the Scudetto.JUST WATCHEDCoronavirus threatens Tokyo 2020 and European footballReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCoronavirus threatens Tokyo 2020 and European football 01:03\"I think now by starting the game this weekend, eventually we can finish the season and I think these are not difficulties only we are facing,\" Zhang said. \"I think all the other clubs are having the same issues, but for sure step by step playing the games, week by week we can conquer the difficulties.\"When you are looking at sports events and league matches, especially those taking nine or 10 month or almost a year to finish, in the middle of it you never see or can never predict what can happen at the end -- and that's why sports are so exciting and fascinating for people.\"So even though there are some great moments, and even though maybe sometimes there are up and downs ... we can only judge by end of the season.\"",

        "content": "London (CNN)The billionaire ruler of Dubai arranged the kidnapping of two of his adult daughters and forcibly returned them to the Gulf state after they attempted to flee abroad, a UK court has found.In a case described by the judge as \"extraordinary,\" the family division of the High Court in London also found that Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum conducted a \"campaign of fear and intimidation\" against his former wife, Jordanian Princess Haya bint al-Hussein.The court determined that the sheikh organized abductions of his two daughters on three occasions -- including one from the historic UK city of Cambridge and another in international waters off the coast of India.The findings were revealed after a series of hearings in London involving Princess Haya and can now be disclosed after reporting restrictions were lifted.Sir Andrew McFarlane, the UK most senior family judge, established as fact that Sheika Shamsa, one of the sheikh's daughters by another wife, ran away from her family in the summer of 2000 while visiting the UK. She was later abducted and forced into a car in Cambridge by men working for her father, before being driven to property owned by the sheikh. There, she was put on helicopter to Deauville in France and then on a jet back to Dubai.Read MoreAnother daughter, Sheika Latifa, had twice tried to escape her Emirati family but was forced back, once in 2002 from the border of Dubai with Oman, and in 2018 \"by an armed commando assault at sea\" in international waters near the coast of India, the judge found.\"With respect to both Shamsa and Latifa it is asserted that following their return to the custody of the father's family they have been deprived of their liberty,\" the judgement says, finding the assertion to be true.Princess Haya, Dubai ruler's wife, seeks court order to prevent child's forced marriageSheikh Mohammed -- the 70-year-old vice president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates --  said the court's assessment was a one-sided account.\"This case concerns highly personal and private matters relating to our children. The appeal was made to protect the best interests and welfare of the children. The outcome does not protect my children from media attention in the way that other children in family proceedings in the UK are protected,\" he said in a statement issued by his representatives.\"As a head of government, I was not able to participate in the court's fact-finding process. This has resulted in the release of a 'fact-finding' judgment which inevitably tells only one side of the story. I ask that the media respect the privacy of our children and do not intrude into their lives in the UK.\"The judgment said the sheikh, had he wished, was fully able to take part in the hearings and that his account did not contradict the evidence in regards to the abductions.\"Indeed, his account confirms that he, together with Shamsa's mother, 'decided to organize a search for her.' The other evidence indicates that the operation to remove Shamsa from Cambridge and thence to Dubai was undertaken by those working for, or assisting the father and his staff,\" the judge noted.In his ruling published Thursday, McFarlane also found that the sheikh conducted a sustained campaign of fear, intimidation and harassment of Princess Haya. The court determined that the princess had begun an adulterous relationship with one of her male bodyguards, which was all part of a deteriorating relationship with the sheikh, who without her knowledge, divorced her under Sharia law in 2019.The judge found that the princess received several threats, including a series of anonymous notes, left in her bedroom or elsewhere, making threats, for example: \"We will take your son -- your daughter is ours -- your life is over,\" and warning her to be careful.Sheikh Mohammed and Princess Haya attended Royal Ascot in 2014.Believing she was unsafe, Princess Haya fled Dubai for London with her two children by the sheikh. The princess, who was the sheikh's sixth wife and is not the mother of the abducted daughters, brought the case to seek wardship for the two children, aged eight and 12, fearing they too would be kidnapped.  Giving testimony last year, she told the court: \"It's not just him I'm worried about. It's the people around him, people that I know. I know how they operate. I have seen what has happened to their sisters and I can't face the fact that the same might happen to them.\"In the early stages of the nine-month proceedings, the sheikh denied Princess Haya's allegations. Last October, he dropped his opposition to the wardship and attempted to prevent the fact-finding element of the case going ahead. But the judge ruled it should proceed anyway, and its findings can inform any future legal action.Allegations of tortureIn 2018, Latifa recorded a video, uploaded to YouTube, in which she alleged her father had her imprisoned for over three years, during which she was tortured. \"I went in June 2002 and I came out in October 2005... It was constant torture, constant torture, even when they weren't physically beating me up, they were torturing me,\" she alleged.Dubai ruler sues wife Princess Haya in UK's High CourtThe judge said that he did not have enough evidence to allegations of torture as true, though he made clear he also did not have evidence to establish them as untrue. In December 2018, Latifa was visited by the former UN Human Rights Commissioner Mary Robinson. Latifa was seen in grainy photographs alongside Robinson, a former President of Ireland, who said later that Latifa was \"troubled\" and \"regretted\" her attempts to escape. Robinson's account was criticized by human rights activists. Princess Haya, the daughter of the late King Hussein of Jordan and the half-sister of the King of Jordan, is a well-known international figure. She is close friends with the heir to the British throne, Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall. Princess Haya's lawyer Fiona Shackleton acted for Prince Charles in his divorce from Princess Diana.The princess, 45, studied politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford University and is a keen equestrian, representing Jordan at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.",

Sited on the shore of San Francisco Bay, it has been the Golden State Warriors' home since the start of this NBA season.It is a stunning arena, befitting of a team which has reached the NBA Finals in all of the past five seasons, winning three times.But right now it is the home of a struggling team bottom of the Western Conference, with a record of 14 wins and 49 losses. This season the Warriors have been dour, uninspired and seemingly rudderless.Read MoreWith Steph Curry's return from injury last night, that may well have changed.READ: LeBron James calls Zion Williamson 'special' after pair's first clashREAD: LeBron James believes NBA is 'in great hands' following rematch with Zion WilliamsonSteph Curry played his last game on October 30 but a broken hand in that game has kept him out of basketball for four months.Yes, the Warriors lost the game 113-121 to the Toronto Raptors in a rematch of the 2019 NBA Finals.But that was never going to be the story of the night.After breaking his left hand in a fall during only his fourth game of the season, how Curry fared after four months out was the real narrative.And he showed exactly what the team have been missing, scoring 23 points and recording seven assists and seven rebounds.He was the Warriors' joint top-scorer with Damion Lee, was second in assists and third in rebounds despite only playing 27 minutes.READ: Is Zion Williamson vs. Ja Morant a new NBA rivalry?AudaciousWhat defined Curry's return was not just his measurables, but the nature in which he contributed.Playing in a line up that contained not a single player from last year's team, Curry brought energy and creativity.Steph Curry and Toronto Raptors' Kyle Lowry met in the 2019 NBA Finals, which the Raptors won too.With his second assist, he made a behind-the-back pass to new teammate Andrew Wiggins, who only recently joined the outfit through a trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves for D'Angelo Russell.Curry's audacious move produced a roar of approval from the arena's expectant crowd, possibly tinged with relief at the return of their beloved point guard.He reproduced the move on multiple occasions throughout the game.At a press conference afterward, Curry said with a cheeky smile that while he didn't go into the game with the intention of making those passes, he certainly wasn't avoiding making them.\"Have you seen me play for 11 years? I love doing that,\" he grinned.READ: Why Italy remembers Kobe Bryant 'as a son, not as a star'READ: He was born to play basketball, but for Kobe Bryant that was never enoughCurry managed to score only three 3-point shots, but each brought electric roars from the crowd.The Warriors have missed the signature cheekiness and fun that Curry emits; the play hard and have fun attitude.They have also missed his 3-pointers.Curry made only three of his 12 attempts last night, which is a completion percentage far below his career average of 43.5 percent.But again with Curry, it is how he made those three that invigorated his team and his audience.'Trump criticism was surreal' -- Sue Bird remembers when Donald Trump targeted girlfriend Megan Rapinoe The second was peak Curry.Receiving the ball some distance behind the three-point line with only one second on the shot clock and Raptors guard Kyle Lowry closing him down, Curry maintained composure to drop the ball into the basket perfectly.Injured long-time teammates Klay Thompson and Draymond Green erupted with celebration, as did the entire arena.These are the plays they have all waited for this year, these are the moments for which this jewel of a venue was built.The result might not be what the Warriors or their fans wanted.

        "content": "(CNN)Inspirational, but tough as nails, Monica Aldama is a coach you don't want to mess about with or disappoint.Aldama is very much the star of Netflix's latest mega-hit Cheer -- the six-part series which reveals the world of cheerleading at its mesmerizing, bone-crunching and jaw-dropping best.Mapping the season of Navarro College's dominant cheer squad, the viral sensation has changed the way thousands of people view the sport.Dedication, sacrifice and hours of practice are laid bare as young athletes from across the US find sanctuary in the most unlikely of places. \"I'm very competitive and I want to be successful but I also want to be that person that leads by example. I really set a high standard for myself,\" Aldama, who has become known as the \"Queen of Cheer,\" told CNN Sport.Read More\"If I expect something from my kids, I should expect it from myself too. I shouldn't even have to say anything but my actions will lead the kids and they'll do the things I'm doing.\"READ: Kayaker Dane Jackson drops down 134-foot waterfallCheer coach Monica Aldama spoke to CNN Sport about life after the Netflix show. Ellen and OprahAldama had already established herself as one of the best cheer coaches in the sport, but not even she could have prepared herself for what happened next.Appearances on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and Oprah's live tour catapulted the entire team to stardom and shone a bright light on Aldama's unrivaled success and methods.Her glittering career has included 14 National Championships as a coach and her style has been compared to some of sports' most revered leaders. The only thing I want to talk about is 'Cheer' on Netflix\"It's very strange, because I've had so many people view me in different ways after watching this show,\" Aldama said. \"Some people love me, some people don't. \"I know where my heart is and I know what happened the other four months that were not in those six hours. I would not change anything.\" The kids Aldama continually refers to throughout the show are the young adults who manage to secure a place on her acclaimed team.It's an elite squad made up of students from a variety of backgrounds from all over the US, uniting together in a remote corner of Texas as they are rigorously drilled to compete at the very top of their game.For many of the teenagers, a place in Aldama's team is a ticket out of trouble and a chance to make a better life for themselves. The series, directed by Greg Whiteley, highlights the often harrowing back stories of some of the cheerleaders and Aldama is acutely aware that her role stretches way beyond coaching complex acrobatic moves.She is as much a mother figure to her students as she is a coach, soaking up their anxieties and pushing them to succeed in both their personal and professional lives.  The docuseries follows the Navarro College cheer team in their pursuit of success. Aldama helps create mind-blowing routines. READ: Swiss climbs 1,800-foot vertical rock face in record time... without a safety rope'I don't have to prove myself'One of the young people to flourish under Aldama's wing is Morgan Simianer.The talented gymnast has become one of the breakout stars from the show, with her complicated history providing the series with one of its most emotional moments. We learn how Simianer was forced to raise herself in a trailer after her biological parents abandoned her at an early age, but how that turbulent childhood gave her an unwavering drive to succeed.'Cheer' phenomenon isn't happening in a vacuumIt's an attitude that comes across crystal clear in a series where her loyalty to Aldama, who seems to provide a pillar of stability in Simianer's life, is resolute. \"I've really tried to work over the years on being better at that and just learning what I could do to fill those roles for those kids,\" added Aldama as she reflected on the complexity of coaching the team.\"I think that's really why I'm still here, it's not cheerleading. I've won plenty of titles, I don't have to prove myself there. It's the relationship with the kids and the feeling of watching them succeed.\"I feel like it's God's purpose for me and that's why I haven't left the job yet.\"Make no mistake, as much as Navarro College is a sanctuary for many, corners are never cut in the constant search for success. Aldama demands nothing but 100% dedication to the cause with eyes firmly set on the annual National Championship in Daytona, scene of the thrilling finale to the series. Her mantra is to \"keep going until you get it right, and then you keep going until you can't get it wrong,\" though that level of expectation pushes her charges to the very edge of their physical and emotional capabilities.Morgan Simianer is one of the young cheerleaders who features in the show. READ: Climbing 3,000 feet without ropesInjury heavyAldama's trademark moves -- breathtaking somersaults, tumbles, and stunning pyramids -- combine to deliver an explosive two minutes and 15 seconds routine which can occasionally go wrong. \"They showed every time we fell but they didn't show the one thousand times that we did it right or the progressions that we did to build up to the harder skills,\" said Aldama when asked whether the series gave an accurate depiction of the program she runs. \"We definitely are very safe, but it is cheerleading. It's a risky sport that we're doing but we do take precautions and I think that it was just a little heavy on the injuries.\" What's not in doubt is that the special culture forged at the college seems to encourage its stars to push through blood, sweat, and tears for the sake of the team ethic.  Notably former squad members return to help mentor the latest crop, a feature of the program that Monica takes immense pride in. However, her coaching style is not just with competition in mind. Preparing these young adults for life in the real world is equally important to her.\"Self-accountability is just such a big thing for me, because so many people in this day and age, want to shift the blame to others and just not take responsibility for their own actions,\" Aldama said.\"If you've made a commitment to be somewhere, then you should show up. If it's class, then you should show up. If it's practice, you should show up. If it's a job, you should show up.\"Aldama said the training is very safe despite the show focusing on injuries. True athletes As well as enhancing the Navarro College cheer team's reputation, Aldama hopes the hit show can also help the sport establish itself in the mainstream.So often viewed through the lens of tired stereotypes, the show has given the sport a platform to show just how athletic it can be when done properly.\"These kids are honestly some of the toughest kids I know. The work ethic that these kids have is top notch, they will come in and work, work, work. Work through the pain,\" Aldama added.\"The commitment is unreal. I just didn't feel like people who aren't a part of this world really knew that these kids are that athletic and that they have that grit and that determination. \"I was hoping that the world would see them as the true athletes that they are.\"",

Some have been forced to work from home or turn to grandparents for help, and women are taking on much of the childcare burden. \"It had an impact on me, of course,\" said Gini Dupasquier, a consultant in Milan whose teenage daughters are now studying from home. \"It is hard for families to balance work and life. School is the backbone of the country.\"Italian students have joined nearly 300 million children forced to stay home because of the coronavirus outbreak globally. Just a few weeks ago, China, the epicenter of the epidemic, was the only country to have shuttered schools. But, in recent days, at least 33 countries across three different continents have followed suit.The temporary closures are wreaking havoc on daily life around the world, so much so that the United Nations warned this week that the \"global scale and speed of the current educational disruption is unparalleled.\"Professor Maurizio Casiraghi records a lesson on the evolution of genomes in an empty classroom in Milan.Italy, which is experiencing the worst outbreak of the disease in Europe, has closed all schools -- nurseries to universities -- until Sunday, March 15. But many believe that date will be pushed back, as confirmed cases in the country climb to more than 140.Read More\"I don't think this will end anytime soon,\" said Riccardo Arienti, a 52-year-old Milan business owner and father of two.  Arienti's electronics company in the Italian city employs 15 people -- and, unlike many small businesses in Milan, remains busy despite the crisis. He and his wife still go in to the office every day, leaving their daughters, aged 4 and 8, at home with a babysitter.Italy shuts all schools over coronavirus outbreakAnd it's not only parents who are bearing the brunt of the disruption. In less than 24 hours following the announcement, teachers were scrambling to move educational programs online, adapting them to fit the new e-learning format. The Italian education ministry launched an information portal focused on remote learning and said 2,000 teachers participated in webinars on distance learning on Tuesday, the first day of the program. At least one educator told CNN that preparing video lessons, Google quizzes and video conferences has tripled their working day.The widescale public health challenge has proven to be an educational one too.An hour's drive northeast of Milan, a group of teenagers was hanging out in a park in the city of Bergamo, when they heard the news of the closures. \"Really?\" they asked.One boy said he was \"happy\" he may miss a German exam. Two girls feared an exchange program in April may be canceled. Under normal circumstances, these 16- and 17-year-olds would be at school on a week-day afternoon. Many of the group are happy they're not.\"Everyone is worrying about it [coronavirus] but I don't think it's a big deal -- only for old people,\" Aya said.But Alessandra is starting to tire of the restrictions. \"I am kind of happy, but at home I am bored,\" she admitted. \"I miss my friends, and some of my teachers. I miss having a routine every day.\"CNN's Ben Wedeman and Jo Shelley reported and wrote from Milan, while Gianluca Mezzofiore reported from London.",

She subsequently returned to government and remained a prominent figure in British politics until December's snap general election, which she did not contest.A number of MPs have leapt to Rudd's defense after her talk was scrapped -- including former Labour deputy leader and political adversary Tom Watson, who wrote: \"If you're trying to silence Amber Rudd you really are being anti-democratic.\"Some students also criticized the decision on Facebook, and the university said in a statement on Friday that it \"strongly disapproves\" of the decision.We strongly disapprove of the decision by the UNWomen Oxford UK Society to disinvite Amber Rudd after she had been asked to speak.Oxford is committed to freedom of speech & opposes no-platforming.

West Bromwich Albion forward Jonathan Leko was subjected to racist abuse from Leeds United goalkeeper Kiko Casilla while on loan at Charlton Athletic on September 28. Spaniard Casilla was banned for eight matches and fined $78,000 (\u00a360,000) on February 28 after being found guilty by the English Football Association to have racially abused the England Under-21 international. Between the original incident and the verdict from the independent regulatory commission, 22 weeks had passed.Racism in football is 'bubbling up again,' says UK anti-racism headIn a statement, Leko said he was \"disappointed\" it took so long for the FA to make its decision, and let down by the lack of support from anti-racism bodies. Read More\"Knowing what occurred in the game that day, it has been difficult to watch Casilla continue to play for such a lengthy period as if nothing had happened,\" Leko said on the West Brom website.\"I would urge the game's governing bodies to look into their own processes when such incidents are reported. \"It was 22 weeks between the incident and the hearing during which I had minimal contact from the PFA, of which I am a member, and no contact in the way of support from leading anti-racism bodies such as 'Kick It Out' and 'Show Racism The Red Card'. Some support or guidance would have been very welcome.\"Casilla released his own statement on the event in which he said he \"did not feel it was a true reflection of the incident.\"The Professional Footballers' Association, the organization tasked with giving \"advice and guidance for current and former players,\" apologized to Leko on Twitter. \"We do not want any player to feel unsupported when going through something as difficult as this,\" it said in a statement.READ: No surprise if Africans choose MLS over Europe because of 'awful' racism, says Uganda starLeko celebrates after scoring against Mansfield Town in the Carabao Cup for West Brom.\"At the time of the incident, we reached out to the club to advise them that we have a dedicated equalities team in place that can support and guide Jonathan through the investigation and hearing process. This is usual procedure following a racist incident. \"Unfortunately, on this occasion, we did not hear back and wrongly assumed that Jonathan did not require our support.\"We're grateful for Jonathan's feedback and will review our procedures to ensure we learn from this moving forward. Following the hearing we reached out to Jonathan directly and have subsequently arranged a meeting.\"Following the release of the FA's reasons for banning Casilla, it was revealed that both Leko and his then-teammate Macauley Bonne reported Casilla's words to referee John Brooks, who included the incident in his match report.READ: Soccer icon Gullit 'disappointed' players didn't 'protect' racially abused star MaregaLeko during West Brom's pre-season friendly against Kidderminster Harriers.But following the drawn-out trial, Leko -- who was ruled out for the rest of the season in December 2019 after suffering an ACL injury -- has doubts over the FA's anti-racism process.\"By bringing the incident to the referee's attention immediately, I was only doing what I have been educated to do throughout my career. But I found the hearing, at which I was made to feel I had done something wrong, extremely stressful,\" he said.\"It made me question whether I would be prepared to go through it all again were I on the receiving end of similar abuse in the future. I certainly would think twice about how to advise another player placed in the same situation. \"From the outset, all I have done is report something that had to be challenged and exposed for what it is -- racial abuse.\"Kick it Out released a further statement Thursday, after Sanjay Bhandari, chair of the organization, said on his Twitter account that it attempted to reach out to Leko.\"Kick It Out did reach out via the proper channels to Charlton within days of the incident to offer our support to Jonathan Leko and we extend him our sympathy as he did not receive the appropriate support he needed during this stressful experience,\" it said.\"We can confirm that we have not heard from Kiko Casilla or Leeds United FC as yet, however we extend an olive branch to him and the club to provide practical support and continued opportunities for re-education.\"We are somewhat disappointed with the length of ban administered, particularly as The FA were pushing for an additional two matches. This ban is in line with a similar case going back eight plus years and we would ask does it send a message that we have not moved on since that period of time.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Muscles aching after an afternoon gym session, Tayla Harris is spending the early evening hanging laundry in the backyard of her Melbourne home. \"Pretty standard procedure,\" says the athlete who has experienced a far from ordinary 12 months. Until last March, Harris was admired by many yet not widely recognized. As a young player in the women's Australian Football League (AFLW), a summer sport that is an Australian obsession, her focus had been on flourishing professionally in two sports -- on making a name for herself on the football field and, during the off season, in the boxing ring, too.But a picture posted on Facebook last year of Harris playing for her team Carlton Blues elevated the then 21-year-old beyond the world of sport. She became one of the most talked-about sportswomen on the planet. First came the vile messages, and they came thick and fast -- sexist, disturbing and damaging comments posted below a now iconic picture of Harris doing her job. Harris' fearless response was then shared by thousands on social media, prompting celebrities, and even Australia's Prime Minister, to voice their support. She had stood up and spoken out. It changed her world. \"I would be happy to go through it all again, but I'd rather not,\" says Harris. Read MoreWith one tweet Harris had made a lasting impression in the usually transitory world of social media, while the photograph is now a symbol of defiance. T-shirts with her silhouette can be bought and a bronze statue of her was unveiled on Australian Women's Day in September.\"I love it when a mum or a young daughter and son says to me 'thanks for standing up to what you stood up for,'\" Harris tells CNN Sport. \"If my example is going to help someone in any way, I would be happy to go through it all again. I'd rather not, but there's been so many amazing messages. It's been an eye-opening experience.\"'Here's a picture of me at work'It is the opening minutes of the AFLW's Pride Game between the Western Bulldogs and Carlton on March 17, 2019, and Harris, the Blues' forward, has kicked the first goal of the game. Photographer Michael Willson has brilliantly captured the athleticism of the act: she is mid-air, looking to her left, focusing on the trajectory of a ball which is out of shot. So gymnastically high is her right leg, her right foot is above her head. While a few feet from the ground, she is almost doing the splits.What followed is said to have changed the landscape of women's sport in Australia. Posting the picture on its 7AFL Facebook page, Australian broadcaster Channel 7 captions it \"photo of the year.\" Here's a pic of me at work... think about this before your derogatory comments, animals. pic.twitter.com/68aBVVbTTj\u2014 Tayla Harris (@taylaharriss) March 19, 2019\n\nFew could have foreseen that the number of, in the broadcaster's words, \"inappropriate and offensive\" comments would lead to Channel 7 deleting the post 24 hours later because, it said, the messages had become difficult to monitor. But erasing a picture that showcased the prowess of the women's game caused more damage. After all, such an act does not silence trolls. \"THE PROBLEM WAS NOT THE PHOTO,\" tweeted Sam Kerr, one of the world's best female soccer players, echoing the thoughts of many. A few hours later, the hashtag \"Tayla\" was trending on Twitter. At the time, Harris was at home getting ready for bed, \"just doing my thing,\" she says, when her phone started pinging. One notification rapidly following another. \"I didn't think 'oh, this is a really personal attack,\" Harris explains. \"I just thought, obviously this is a much bigger issue than just saying sexist things to people. It's actually the start of something much worse.\" After a phone conversation with the chief executive of a national project which aims to eliminate domestic and family violence, Harris proceeded to post a message which became the most liked tweet of 2019 in Australia. \"Here's a picture of me at work ... think about this before your derogatory comments, animals,\" Harris wrote. The tweet remains pinned at the top of her profile page. \"When I saw a little picture on Facebook and I'd see a young girl with a man who has made these comments, it was horrifying to think that this girl had to live, or be around someone, who is able to actually say these things. I thought about it in depth,\" Harris continues. \"I responded after an hour or two. I thought 'I have the photo, so I'll just put it up and just chuck that caption on' and what happened, happened. I didn't put it up as a fk you to Channel 7, I just put it up because I thought it was a cool photo.\" Harris speaks next to Carlton CEO Cain Liddle during a press conference at Ikon Park.Harris went to bed with around 20,000 Twitter followers but by the next morning had an additional 60,000. There was an apology from Channel 7 for sending \"the wrong message\" by removing the photo from its social media accounts, while Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison called the trolls \"cowardly grubs.\" With a weekend match looming, Harris restricted herself to one radio interview in the immediate aftermath, during which she described the comments as sexual abuse, and held a press conference to sate the appetite of media organizations around the world. Carlton provided her with a security guard for the next game, against Fremantle. \"Surreal,\" and a \"roller-coaster\" is how she sums up the week. \"For the most part it was all positive,\" she adds, \"but I had to check in with myself and make sure this was something I was OK with because it was a really full on and busy, confronting few weeks. \"The really important thing for me was not to dilute the messaging or say something that could be misinterpreted, so I made sure I was really clear and articulate.\"To understand Harris' inner strength, we must step back in time, to the first decade of the century when the self-confessed daddy's girl was growing up in the northern suburbs of Brisbane and towering above her elementary schoolmates. She would grow to become 5ft 10in.

I was a big kid, I was tall, so instead of saying something I would stand physically in the way but, at one point, this boy was relentless so I took him down and, apparently, I pushed him to the ground and held him down and then I found myself in the Principal's office.\"My dad remembers the Principal saying, 'Tayla can't be doing those things because that will hurt the boy's self-esteem.' Dad went off his head. My dad still tells that story, about how wrong that particular incident was.\" Such spirit helped Harris -- who played Aussie Rules with boys until she was told to stop aged 14 -- rise to an elite athlete in two sports. She is unbeaten in seven professional fight and holds the Australian middleweight crown.Yet like most women in sport, Harris has had to develop a thick skin. She was accustomed to online abuse long before a picture of that kick was posted online. Her decision to join the Blues from the Brisbane Lions in 2018 stoked keyboard rage but a \"lightbulb moment\" after a conversation with a close friend helped her ride it out. \"He said 'why do you care what someone who you've never met and will probably never meet and have never done anything for you in your life think' so, from that moment, I was like 'why do I care what that weird scummy guy is saying',\" says Harris, conceding that putting up with trolls is likely her lot in life, for the immediate future at least. Harris has tweeted that she'd give up her AFLW wage to employ a person to monitor online abuse and has called on governing body the AFL to block people who make discriminatory comments from its social media accounts.Speaking before the death of English television presenter Caroline Flack, which led to the #BeKind hashtag being used on social media, Harris adds: \"It's a pretty messed up online world.\"It's a generational issue. It'll be weeded out in a while when young people come through with the understanding that it's not acceptable to be doing these things.\"Harris (R) fights againt Janay Harding on November 22, 2019.Her parents, Harris admits, struggle to stoically react to the abuse she continues to receive online.  \"They live a plane trip away so (last year) was hard, especially for mum, especially when it was all unfolding as all she wanted to do was get on the plane and make sure I was alright,\" Harris says. \"And all dad wanted to do was go and pay a visit to the people who were making these comments and I guess the rest is best left unsaid.\"Even before that kick was immortalized in bronze in Melbourne's bustling Federation Square, Harris warned her mum not to go online. \"I said to her 'please don't read the comments that are going to be online' because I knew people wouldn't take the time to consider that this statue is about much more than just me,\" Harris says.  \"Particular people who didn't take the time to understand what the statue meant were hellbent on saying I didn't deserve this statue. I know I don't deserve a statue as a footballer, but this scenario deserves a statue for a pivotal moment in time that has helped people.\"Bec Rawlings: From the terror of domestic abuse to bare-knuckle world championHarris will forever be known for that photograph, but though only 22 she is not burdened by the responsibility that comes with influence.\"I often get young people who have experienced bullying online messaging me and they've said specifically that I've been the one who's helped them actually call it out, or help their friends call it out,\" she says. \"Bullying online is so bad that young people are committing suicide, which is horrific, so if I can give someone confidence to feel a little bit better about themselves, I will do everything to do that because you just don't know what could've happened otherwise.\"Makes clear in paragraph eight that Australian Women's Day was in September 2019.",

        "content": "(CNN)Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp dismissed questions about coronavirus following Tuesday's FA Cup defeat by Chelsea, insisting his opinion on the subject is irrelevant.Since the outbreak in December, more than 3,200 people have died and 92,000 have been infected in more than 70 countries and territories around the world.Several sporting invents have already been affected, notably in Italy where the government has said it is \"highly likely\" top-flight Serie A football matches will be played behind closed doors for one month.On Monday, the Premier League said it is \"monitoring\" the coronavirus situation ahead of this weekend's fixtures and has issued guidelines to all 20 clubs in English football's top tier, following the same procedures outlined by the National Health Service for all other businesses and venues used by large numbers of people.\"What I don't like in life is that a very serious thing, a football manager's opinion is important,\" Klopp told reporters. \"I don't understand that.

So it's not important what famous people say.Read More\"We have to speak about things in the right manner, not people with no knowledge, like me, talking about something.

Since the 10-day winter break, Liverpool has scraped past bottom club Norwich, lost to Atletico Madrid, squeaked past struggling West Ham thanks to a goalkeeping howler, suffered a surprise defeat by relegation-threatened Watford and has now been beaten by Chelsea. In those three defeats Liverpool failed to score and in their last four games have shipped eight goals.The poor run is no doubt amplified by the ludicrously high standards Liverpool has set this season; any slight blip was bound to cause concern.However, Klopp was adamant that he's not worried about Liverpool's run of form following Tuesday's 2-0 FA Cup defeat by Frank Lampard's side.\"Losing 2-0 is not good, but in this case it's relatively easy to explain,\" Klopp told reporters after the match. \"We made two massive mistakes around the goals. The performance tonight was completely different to the performance against Watford. Against Watford, it was really bad. Tonight, it was not bad.\"I liked the reaction. I liked the way we played. There was some good stuff. It was a super intense game. We made seven changes because we knew it would be intense. But I'm not concerned about momentum. It's football.READ: Liverpool lose first Premier League game of the season, beaten 3-0 by WatfordREAD: 'Unbelievable' Jurgen Klopp deserves all the credit for Liverpool success, says MidoA frustrated Jurgen Klopp gesticulates on the sidelines against Chelsea.\"We never thought that it would be an easy season, that it would be an easy period, that it would be an easy game tonight. Nothing. It was always difficult, but we did very well. We were just not good enough in decisive moments, and that's what we have to accept.\"Liverpool boasts a seemingly insurmountable 22-point lead over Manchester City and a first top flight title in 30 years looks to be a formality.But this run of form, in particular the defensive frailties that have appeared, will worry Liverpool fans -- and Klopp -- as the team tries to overturn a 1-0 deficit against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League.Liverpool welcomes Diego Simeone's side to Anfield on March 12 and many would still put the Reds as the overwhelming favorite to progress -- bearing in mind last season's 4-0 demolition of Barcelona.Virgil van Dijk of Liverpool remonstrates with referee Chris Kavanagh during the defeart to Chelsea.\"Momentum went our way for so long because we defended outstandingly,\" said Klopp as he reflected on his side's FA Cup defeat.\"Usually you don't get a lot of chances against us but now we have to admit that in the last four games we conceded absolutely too many goals. But they are all completely different situations, so it's not one problem.\"I'm not worried about momentum. You don't get it as a present and you have always the chance to get it back. We're not 100 miles away and the boys are strong. We have done very well but tonight was not good enough in decisive moments and that is what we have to accept.\"Liverpool's frustration, on show throughout the defeat to Watford, was palpable against Chelsea, as evidenced by outbursts from Sadio Mane and Virgil van Dijk.Up next for the wobbling Reds is Saturday's home Premier League tie against struggling Bournemouth and a resounding victory would certainly inject some life into what appear to be some lethargic legs.",

        "content": "(CNN)Following the devastating bushfires in Australia, there is now a significant and immediate threat of extinction to the koala population, according to a new report. A minimum of 5,000 koalas are estimated to have died, according to the report released Wednesday by the global conservation group International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW). That's nearly 12 percent of the animal's population in New South Wales (NSW).These estimates are an intentionally conservative calculations, IFAW Wildlife Campaigner Josey Sharrad told CNN in an email. The actual number is likely to be much higher. \"Koalas are particularly vulnerable to bushfires as they are slow moving and live in eucalyptus trees that burn quickly and intensely,\" Sharrad said.\"When fires sweep through their homes, they often don't have time to escape, particularly in intense crown fires that rage through the treetops where they live,\" she added.Read MoreMore than 12 million acres of land burned across NSW during the bushfires, and nearly 45 million acres burned across Australia, leaving the koala habitat unsuitable for living.Finding \"an immediate, ongoing and significant threat of extinction,\" the report states that koalas are eligible for a provisional listing as Endangered on an emergency basis under the NSW Biodiversity Conservation Act of 2016. The endangered listing would last for two years to allow the species the breathing space to being to recover while experts further evaluate the situation. After more than 240 days, Australia's New South Wales is finally free from bushfiresAdditionally, a higher listing means higher penalties for offenses that harm the endangered species.\"Our koalas only stand a chance if we help,\" Sharrad said. \"They are literally fighting for their survival.\"Over the last three generations, nearly two-thirds of the population has been lost to drought, bushfires and man-made causes. Koalas were already living on the brink before these fires and are most vulnerable to climate change, deforestation, and land-clearing. \"This rapid destruction of koala habitat, combined with climate change, is inflicting substantial stress and pushing the species towards extinction,\" Sharrad said. \"Reduction and fragmentation of koala habitat exposes koalas to the added threats of vehicle strikes, dog attacks, stress and disease,\" she added. With climate change and high-frequency fire only likely to increase, there are significant challenges for the longer-term survival, and for many populations the chances of recovery are unlikely, the study said. Sharrad told CNN she hopes NSW Environment Minister Matt Kean will call for the provisional uplisting of the koala species to Endangered and declare its habitat as an \"area of outstanding biodiversity value.\"Nearly every animal coming into their care right now is already dehydrated or malnourished from prolonged drought and excessive land-clearing, Sharrad said.\"Koalas were already living on a knife edge before the fires, and this could be the last straw,\" she said.",

Having secured his second straight overall Longines Global Champions Tour (LGCT) individual championship as well as the Global Champions League (GCL) team title for the London Knights in New York in September, the pair finished their stellar season with a bang by taking the $1.4 million Longines Global Champions Tour Super Grand Prix in Prague in November.JUST WATCHED LGCT Miami: Building a stadium on the sandReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH LGCT Miami: Building a stadium on the sand 01:37Maher, a 37-year-old Briton who started riding ponies when he was eight, won Olympic gold during the London Summer Games in 2012. Explosion W, a feisty 11-year-old chestnut gelding owned by Poden Farms, Maher's backers, is the youngest horse to win the GCL team series and the LGCT championship race. A tall, naturally fast mover, Explosion W has been victorious on different surfaces, including in vast, grassy arenas such as Madrid as well as in tight, sandy arenas like London. When asked by CNN's EQ equestrian show in July what made the Anglo-Dutch pair such a strong combination, Maher said: \"Riding a horse is like flying a plane, they're not machines but it's a lot of hours, a lot of time to go into building the relationship.\"Maher, who has earned \u20ac3.2 million ($3.8 million) from three LGCT seasons, is now tied with Australian rider Edwina Tops-Alexander and Britain's Scott Brash with two overall individual LGCT championships.It will be fascinating to see if he can secure a record third overall victory and establish himself as the most successful rider in tour history.READ: Ben Maher on the secrets of his successREAD: 'Riding a horse is like flying a plane'JUST WATCHEDBen Maher: Secrets of My SuccessReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBen Maher: Secrets of My Success 02:30Season opener in 'Hollywood for horses'The luxurious, multi million dollar Al Shaqab equestrian center will host the first of 18 tour events this weekend.

They are real passports but with fake details. They were issued in January 2020, and the ID cards, which were given to them when they arrived, in December,\" the prosecutor added.

Read MoreThe group provides homesick fans of the Brazilian club an opportunity to sample a small taste of the famous atmosphere at the Maracana, the club's home ground, while living abroad.Flamengo fans flood the streets of Rio de Janeiro to celebrate the Copa Libertadores win.\"It's basically to feel as though we're back in the Maracana stadium,\" Brazilian expatriate Francisco Sousa, who helped set up the group in 2017 alongside Matheus Perreira, tells CNN on the night Flamengo plays Al-Hilal in the Club World Cup semifinal. \"Who else has the chance to go (back) to Brazil? It's to feel like we're at home, to make new friends.\"On Thursday, Flamengo begins the defense of its Copa Libertadores crown, the title it won last season in the most dramatic fashion imaginable. Two stoppage-time goals from star striker Gabriel 'Gabigol' Barbosa overturned a 1-0 deficit against River Plate, giving Flamengo its first Copa Libertadores title since 1981.It was the first time in the competitions history that the final had been one match held at a neutral venue, rather than a two-legged tie at each club's home ground.That victory was the culmination of months of hard work and an incredible turnaround in form after Portuguese coach Jorge Jesus took over in June 2019.Jesus was met with more than his fair share of detractors, many thought he was too old and couldn't adapt tactically to the Brazilian game. One commentator infamously insulted his achievements in Portugal: \"Three titles in the cp Portuguese league?\"Just five months later, Jesus had led Flamengo to a league and Libertadores double -- achieved in the space of 24 hours after second place Palmeiras lost in the Brasileirao -- a feat only previously managed by Santos in 1962 and 1963.JUST WATCHED'Three-nil against Liverpool': Flamengo fans dream of Club World Cup winReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'Three-nil against Liverpool': Flamengo fans dream of Club World Cup win 02:05Jesus had masterminded a comeback in the dying seconds in the Libertadores final, overturned an eight-point deficit -- and then subsequently open up an 16-point lead over Palmeiras -- and, finally, changed the mind of every detractor he had when he first landed in Brazil.Winning the Copa Libertadores ensured Flamengo would take part in the Club World Cup, though the Brazilian team's remarkable season was bookmarked by a 1-0 defeat by Liverpool thanks to Robert Firmino's extra-time winner.When Flamengo takes on Colombian side Junior to kick off this season's campaign, the Consulado's raucous fans will once again come together to cheer on their club.\"Flamengo isn't an allegiance, it's a religion,\" says lifelong fan Maritza Teixeira. \"We love Flamengo to such an extent that you say you support Flamengo more than you do the national team.\"Not since Boca Juniors in 2001 has a team successfully defended the Copa Libertadores title and, as fate would have it, the 2020 final is being held at the Maracana.READ: Force is with Flamengo as River Plate stunned in Copa Libertadores finalREAD: 'Three-nil against Liverpool': Flamengo fans dream of history repeating itself Heroes of 1981Such is the demographic here in The Duchess Bell pub in south west London that Maritza, 66, is the only fan old enough to remember the last time Flamengo was crowned Copa Libertadores champion.Many of the players from that side in 1981 went on to play at the World Cup a year later for Brazil, a team that many believe to be one of the most exciting of all time.Stories about those heroes -- Zico, Junior and Leandro -- have been past down by older generations and fans have had to make do with scouring YouTube for grainy footage of their historic achievements.\"At the time I wasn't born, so I couldn't feel what it was like to be a Libertadores champion, to be a continental champion,\" Sousa says.But now, thanks to Gabigol's two goals, they have heroes of their own.Gabriel Barbosa lifts the Copa Libertadores trophy after his two late goals beat River Plate.\"It's probably bigger than the (national) squad -- Flamengo is above Brazil,\" says fellow supporter Roberta da Cal Braz\u00e3o. \"It feels like you're just around people that have the same feeling as you.\"As she (Teixeira) said, Flamengo is like a religion and you feel like you're back home and you can sing and be yourself.\"Since I can remember I've been a Flamengo fan -- my dad is the biggest. He had two girls and he thought maybe we're not going to like football as much, but we're just absolutely crazy.\"On the nights that Flamengo play, it feels like a fair number of those 32 million supporters congregate here.But these fans don't only come together to watch these football matches; since the Consulado was founded, the group have helped out in the local community around the pubs that host them for these evenings.\"I'm used to being here away from home -- we feel it's part of helping the community to get together, so it's quite special,\" explains Sousa, who moved to England from Brazil in 2003.Whether or not Flamengo does retain its title, these fans will at least have several more opportunities to bring a flavor of the Maracana to this corner of London.",

        "content": "(CNN)It is less than 150 days until Tokyo 2020's opening ceremony and as the landmark approaches there is mounting speculation on how and whether the Olympics will be affected by the growing coronavirus threat.Kanoa Igarashi is a professional surfer born and raised in the US, but will represent Japan, the country of his parents' birth.Expected to be one of Japan's 'stars' this summer -- and one of the host nation's biggest gold medal hopes -- he says it would be \"heartbreaking\" for the athletes and for Japan if the Games were affected, or even postponed due to coronavirus.\"This is an event that people have been preparing for years and putting their lives and souls into one event,\" Igarashi told CNN World Sport's Don Riddell.\"There is a lot that goes into the Olympics.

We are a few months away and I feel like it's probably like 99% ready. \"That's just how the Japanese culture is.

He co-founded the Pearl of Africa Youth Organization which runs football tournaments in Uganda to help children pursue their footballing dreams through education.\"Some kids get lied to by clubs and given contracts at a really early age,\" Azira explained.\"These clubs are just looking for the quick fix and it's easy for these clubs to come and just take advantage of these kids.

I made it mine.\" The Frenchman vividly recalled how his childhood helped drive his passion to invent things.\"In my family, it's not a rich family, when you want something, you had to build it,\" he reflects. \"My brother would build skateboards from dismantled skates and put them on a piece of wood. At the age of four, I had one very small skateboard made by my brother and that influenced me in the way of doing things by myself.\" These days Blondeau's remarkable suits and entrepreneurial spirit has helped him become big in Asia, partly helped by TikTok. \"I [became] a star in South Korea -- I would go to the restaurant and get asked for autographs. People recognized me in the streets,\" said Blondeau, who has more than 200 million likes on his Douyin -- the Chinese TikTok -- videos.The entrepreneur plans to utilize Douyin to help sell Rollerman suits. At $5,300 they don't come cheap but the good news is that you can personalize your order. Blondeau jumps over a pit of spikes on Tianmen Mountain in Zhangjiajie, China.One of his suits, which isn't for sale, features samurai blades and spike horns. Blondeau named it \"Nillor Yggub\" which stands for \"buggy rollin\" in reverse. When he's back at home in France, Blondeau and his girlfriend regularly go rolling in their personalized suits. \"I love the feminine way of expression in the fashion and in the body -- so, I made women suits very early which express an identity of underwear outwear in the culture of French underwear,\" said Blondeau.READ: Like 'falling off the face of the earth,' says kayaker Dane JacksonBlondeau competing in the International Roller Contest in Lausanne, Switzerland in 1998.Rollerman goes to HollywoodThe Frenchman has even had Hollywood moments. His roller suits featured in Jim Carrey's 2008 \"Yes Man\" movie in the rom-com's end credits. \"Meeting Jim Carrey was very nice. He allowed me to go on the studio set and sit with him, the director, the main actress and the actress assistant in the front row,\" said Blondeau, who directed the stunt actors for both Carrey and the leading actress, Zooey Deschanel. Chinese comedian and actor Jackie Chan also asked Blondeau to teach him how to buggy roll for his 2012 action film \"Chinese Zodiac 12.\" \"In China, I am the master of the master, so I like it -- it's very nice,\" giggled Blondeau, who in his suit has taken on the 99 curves of Zhangiajie's Tianmen Mountain, famous for its long jumps, concrete blocks, bumpy rocks, stone impacts, waterfalls and wet tunnels. Rollerman took less than 20 minutes to finish the roll. Blondeau has worked with Jim Carrey and Jackie Chan.READ: The untold story of women climbers trapped on 'the roof of the world'Even with Blondeau's global success -- he has seven million views on YouTube -- his Rollerman journey hasn't been an easy ride, given he's had to juggle the challenges of being an inventor, designer, athlete and entrepreneur. \"I had no idea what I was looking like, and the people were quite surprised. I had a problem long time ago in France because the way the French react when they don't know anything, they try to make a joke and usually it's a bad joke for me,\" said Blondeau.As he prepares to turn 50, Blondeau wants to make Rollerman a comic and video game character and help build arenas to encourage other athletes and enthusiasts to try out the craze.  And contemplating the idea of what's next for Rollerman, Blondeau took a minute to catch a breath and then exclaimed, \"oh many things, maybe too many things.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)The European Union's bad start to the year has taken another turn for the worse. Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan's decision last week to step back from a 2016 deal that halted the flow of migrants from the Middle East into Europe, has sparked fears of a new crisis.The exact numbers of how many people are leaving Turkey for Europe are difficult to locate. Erdogan claimed at the weekend that the numbers would \"reach 25-30,000,\" adding that Turkey \"will not close the doors. EU should keep its promises.\" The Greek foreign office responded on Twitter, stating that the \"numbers cited by Turkish authorities are entirely false and misleading.\"This comes after Turkish claims that a Russian-backed Syrian regime offensive -- including an airstrike last Friday in the Syrian province of Idlib -- killed 51 Turkish military personnel. Idlib is one of the last rebel holdouts in Syria and fears of a return to full-scale conflict has raised concerns of more Syrian migrants heading to the Turkish border. According to the UNHCR, Turkey hosts 4.1 million refugees, including 3.7 million Syrians. Turkey backs some rebel groups in Syria, which is why it has troops inside Idlib. Child drowns off Greek coast after Turkey opens border with Europe Turkey's main complaint is that the EU has not kept to its side of the agreement -- providing economic incentives and support in exchange for dealing with the surge.  Turkey says the EU is not sending money to Turkey fast enough to adequately respond to the crisis. It also believes that those economic incentives, which included making EU visas easier to obtain for Turkish citizens, the potential for increased trade, and re-energized efforts to help Turkey join the bloc (a process that usually comes with fistfuls of EU cash) have not materialized. Read MoreThe EU rejects this claim. An EU Commission spokesperson told CNN that the EU was sticking to its side of the deal, pointing out that the EU had committed over $6.6 billion dollars to handling the crisis, $3.5 of which has already been spent. The source pointed out that Turkey's objections might have more to do with the fact that the money does not go directly to the Turkish government.

Migration has been a hot-button issue in Europe for some time. And the EU's lackluster approach to handling the crisis has left it in a position where a leader like Erdogan can effectively hold a gun to Brussels' head and start making demands.The 2016 agreement came about after Syria's multi-year civil war saw unprecedented numbers of people fleeing violence trying to enter the EU through Greece's land and sea borders with Turkey.Migration had become politically toxic among EU member states. Some leaders, most notably Germany's Angela Merkel, were eager to ease the humanitarian crisis, after reports emerged of refugees being subjected to horrendous living conditions and shocking images were published of bodies washing up on European shores after boats -- overloaded with refugees -- sank.However, welcoming the influx of migrants from Syria aided the growth of Europe's far-right populists. Parties across the bloc used it to bash the EU's refugee policies and argue for tighter border control.JUST WATCHEDTurkey says it will not stop refugees headed to EuropeReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTurkey says it will not stop refugees headed to Europe 03:30Some analysts believe the EU has since treated the refugee crisis more as a political headache to contain than a humanitarian catastrophe. \"The Europe Union has reduced the Syrian quagmire to preventing Syrian migrants crossing into mainland Europe,\" says Chatham House's Fadi Hakura.An unintended consequence of this has been that the EU has in some respects ignored the crisis since reaching its agreement with Turkey.\"2016 was in some ways a missed opportunity,\" says Luigi Scazzieri from the Centre for European Reform, based in Brussels. \"After the agreement, steps were not taken to make the relationship sustainable over time. There was then not much effort made to stop the cause of these problems -- the war in Syria.\"At this point, it's unlikely Erdogan wants much more than money from the EU. Turkey's attempts to join the bloc are on ice for the foreseeable future and Erdogan's increasingly authoritarian rule following an attempted coup in 2016 has left Turkey economically vulnerable.\"Turkey's Achilles heel is not the quagmire in Syria or Libya but the looming economic and financial crisis,\" says Hakura. \"Erdogan will continue to play the Syrian migrant card until the European Union shows resolve and tenacity towards him, which it has failed to do so far.\"And despite Erdogan's deteriorating relationship with the EU, he might find that member states see sending him money as the lesser of two evils.\"I think there will be appetite to send Turkey money, because the alternative is a resumption of the crisis,\" says Scazzieri. \"It might not be as much as Turkey wants, but this is happening at the same time as the coronavirus outbreak. Some member states might not want to stump up the cash, but they also won't want to fight two crises simultaneously.\"Greece stands firm on migrants, as Turkey opens floodgates to EuropeDoing so would come with political risk. As much as supporters of far-right parties might be fuming at the thought of Syrian refugees flooding Europe, they are unlikely to be enthusiastic about sending money to Turkey.There's also a diplomatic risk: giving more money to a Turkish president who is actively engaged in the war in Syria could put the EU, which it should be remembered has no formal hard power, on a collision course with Russia.The EU needs to deal with this fairly quickly. The presidents of the three key EU institutions will visit the Greek border with Turkey to show that the challenge for Greece is a \"European challenge\" and that Greece has the EU's \"full support.\" However, a show of strength is not going to be enough of its own. Any choice it makes will likely be made with a heavy heart. But the EU is fighting too many fronts at the moment to let this drag on. It is struggling with the coronavirus outbreak, divided over budget commitments, gearing up for disagreement with the UK over Brexit and preparing for a massive summit with China in September.So, however unedifying handing more taxpayer cash to Erdogan might feel right now, the EU simply cannot afford to add a standoff with Turkey to its mountainous in-tray right now.",

A bookstore in Gateshead, near Manning's home in northeast England, even promised him a book on the house.He also attracted the attention of several authors.English novelist Matt Haig sent Callum a collection of books, adding: \"Hey let's all follow Cals Book Account on Instagram and show him some support.\"Authors Caroline Kepnes and Malorie Blackman were among those to share Callum's story on social media.  Callum set up his Instagram account last month, posting his first review of Stephen King's \"The Shining\" on February 23. \"This book was the first book I read in 1 day,\" he wrote.

She said that Callum was added to a group chat so he could see the negative comments made about him, before he was removed and then unable to respond.Callum returned to school on Monday, still battling to get through the thousands of messages of support he's been sent. \"I'm sure they're all super jealous,\" Landreth told CNN of Callum's schoolmates.She said she has received a small number of negative responses, but that the vast majority have been positive.And Callum's mother is just as delighted as her son, Landreth said. \"She's so happy people are spreading positive messages about these issues.

On Sunday and Monday alone, some 1,200 migrants arrived by boat on the islands of Lesbos, Chios and Samos, according to UNHCR spokeswoman Carlotta Sami -- a mammoth increase on the less than 100 people who were arriving on the islands each day on average in mid-February.  Dire conditions at the camps are now expected to worsen with the influx of new arrivals. Camps for displaced people on Greek islands in the Aegean Sea have a total capacity of 5,600 but are currently housing more than 40,000 migrants, Sami said, adding that living conditions were \"appalling\" with limited access to sanitation and reports of young people attempting suicide.     Official government statistics obtained by CNN show that Greek authorities prevented 4,354 attempted illegal entries in the 12 hours starting at 6 a.m. local time (12 a.m. ET) on Monday. Another 42 people were arrested in that period, mostly from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Morocco, the statistics show. Between Saturday morning and Monday evening, the authorities stopped 24,203 illegal attempts to enter the country, the data show. In that time, total of 183 people have been arrested. Those arrested have been transported to detention centers and those convicted of illegal entry have been moved to correctional facilities, the government says. Greek courts are sentencing would-be migrants to four years in prison without the possibility of parole, plus a fine of 10,000 euros ($11,163), the documents showed.The influx has also been met with hostility by local residents, who blockaded camp entrances on Sunday evening, according to Jacob Warn, Programme Coordinator for Action for Education, who is based on the island of Chios.He said that a few hundred locals gathered at the island's camp entrance, stringing a huge Greek flag across the narrow road leading to the site, before dispersing after a few hours. Ward said that some locals, already fed up with strained services on the island due to the number of refugees, had expressed fears the new arrivals could also be carrying the coronavirus.These fears were heightened by shocking sanitation at the camps, where Warn said there was \"often one toilet for 300 or 400 people.\"Turkey is home to some 3.5 million Syrian refugees, and has long threatened to open its borders if left to shoulder the burden alone.Turkey's move to open the floodgates tramples on a 2016 deal struck with the European Union to halt migrants traveling from the Middle East towards Europe. Ankara says Europe has failed to hold up its end of that pact. The developments come after an airstrike by Russian-backed Syrian forces killed 33 Turkish soldiers in Idlib, Syria last week. Turkey's about-face on its migrant deal with the EU is seen as a way of leveraging European support for its military operation in Syria.CNN's Sarah Dean, Niamh Kennedy, Ivana Kottasov\u00e1 and Chris Liakos contributed to this report",

        "content": "Pazarkule, Turkey  (CNN)Thousands of migrants are  gathered at Turkey's border with Greece, after the Turkish government last week allowed the refugees passage to Europe saying it had \"reached its capacity.\" The move tramples on a 2016 deal struck with the European Union to halt migrants traveling from the Middle East towards Europe. It comes on the back of an air strike by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the city of Idlib in the neighboring country last week, killing 33 Turkish soldiers. Turkey's about-face is seen as a way of leveraging European support for its military operation in Syria. CNN Senior International Correspondent Arwa Damon and journalist Murat Baykara are at the Pazarkule Border post between Turkey and Greece. They explain the situation on the ground:What's happening on the Turkish border with Greece?Read MoreThe images are horribly reminiscent of the refugee flood in 2015: thousands of refugees, camped out in the open, are clinging to a sliver of hope that they will be able to cross into Europe. This was sparked by Turkey on Thursday saying it would no longer stop refugees from attempting to cross by land or sea into Greece. Refugees in Turkey board buses headed to the border with Greece, on Saturday.Back in 2016, when the masses were taking the refugee trail from Turkey across the EU, the two powers struck a financial aid deal to stem the flow.But Europe never really paid up. And Turkey, hosting upwards of 3.5 million refugees, mostly from Syria, has long threatened to open its borders if left to shoulder the refugee burden alone. Why has Turkey opened the border now?The news that Turkey would be opening its northern borders with Europe emerged shortly after 33 Turkish soldiers were killed in Idlib province in multiple strikes on their convoy. Turkey is using its huge refugee population as leverage against Europe to garner support for its military operation to keep Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces -- backed by Russia and Iran -- from gaining more territory inside Idlib. Since December, around 1 million people have been displaced inside Idlib, moving closer to the border with Turkey, creating a humanitarian crisis along Turkey's southern border. Turkey says it is already beyond capacity when it comes to refugees. And so part of this decision is to clear space, should it decide to open that southern border with Syria.How have Greek authorities reacted? Migrants gather at Pazarkule border as they attempt to enter Greece from Turkey on February 29.Greece has stood firm, not opening its side of the border and beefing up its presence along it. Migrant youths often clash with Greek border guards, who fire tear gas when they attempt to storm the border. Others huddle around fires with their children trying to stay warm. Some refugees attempt to cross the river into Greece. Turkey claims that more than tens of thousands have already crossed into Greece, which is encouraging more people to move towards the border. But Greece says that very few people are making it through. Some groups whom CNN spoke to say Greek personnel forced them back to Turkey, smashed their phones, ripped up their IDs, and beat them. The Greek authorities deny this behavior, although this is something that refugees trying to cross into the country have long accused them of. Where do the refugees want to go and why?The aim is Europe; the ultimate goal is the pursuit of a better life and opportunities. We met refugees from Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, Syria, Iraq, Morocco and Somalia. Some are new arrivals to Turkey who came just waiting for a chance like this. Others have been in Turkey for years but struggled to find work, housing, and education for their children, especially as Turkey's economy took a downward spiral and the cost of living surged. What's the situation like for migrants now?Migrants rest at the Pazarkule Border post between Turkey and Greece.It is desperate and sad. Thousands have been waiting at the border for days. They have no shelter. Temperatures dip below zero at night and it's been raining, so people have been chopping wood from the nearby forest to stay warm. Many of the children are sick, and the elderly are struggling. They left where they were staying in Turkey with just what they can carry so they depend on food aid: this amounts to little more than bread and soup handouts, but there's not enough to go around. Yet many say they are ready to risk it all and carry on waiting. Some know that they are being used as leverage, as political pawns. Others believe that both sides of the border are open -- or that at least when they reach Europe's gates, they will be allowed to cross. What's Russia got to do with it all?For Turkey, what's happening in Idlib and the potential for another Syrian influx is creating a crisis. Turkey, unlike the West, does not have the luxury of turning away from what is happening in Idlib or from the refugee crisis. Tensions escalate between Kremlin and Ankara after dozens of Turkish troops killed in SyriaTurkey wants to prevent a humanitarian disaster in Syria, avoid another refugee flow from that country, and preserve what's left of the Syrian opposition along with the possibility of a genuine political process. In February, Turkey lost more than 50 soldiers in Idlib. At the moment it's facing off with regime forces and their Russian backers on its own. The United States, EU and NATO have issued statements of solidarity, but do little else to help on the military or humanitarian fronts.By opening its borders, Turkey is calculating and hoping for renewed support that extends beyond the rhetoric we have heard so far from the US and the EU; both have been ready to go the extra mile just to keep refugees and migrants out of their own countries. What happens next?It gets uglier. We now have a situation where the lives of the most vulnerable are again being manipulated and used as bartering chips. What is happening at Turkey's northern border with Europe is tied with what is happening at its southern border with Syria. An attempt to control a humanitarian crisis in Syria could ultimately result in an another emergency along its border with Greece.

But it's unlikely that Europe will fold to the pressure, no matter how many arrive at its front door.",

In the second installment between veteran and rookie, it was James who once again came out on top, although Williamson's career-best performance certainly made things more difficult.

        "content": "Rome (CNN)Secret archives at the Vatican will be opened for the first time on Monday, giving scholars access to documents that may shed light on the controversial figure of Pope Pius XII, who has been accused of failing to help to save Jews during World War II.Scholars and Jewish groups have been asking for decades that the archives, which contains millions of letters, cables and correspondence from Pius XII's 1939-1958 pontificate, be made available for study.\"We need to express our enormous gratitude and appreciation to Pope Francis for taking this step,\" said Menachem Rosensaft, associate executive vice president and general counsel of the World Jewish Congress.The Vatican normally waits 70 years after the death of a pope before making his archives available for study. Pope Francis has fast-tracked the opening of the Pius XII archives in order to help clear up the debate over the war-time pope, whose process for sainthood has been temporarily halted. Read More\"The Church is not afraid of history,\" Francis said last March when announcing his decision to make the archives available.The Pope said he hoped that the \"hidden but active diplomacy\" of Pius XII would be evaluated \"in its proper light.\"Pope Pius XII was praised by world leaders following WW2 but his reputation deteriorated after his death in 1958.The controversyIn the years immediately following the war, Pius XII was praised by world leaders, including Israel's then-Prime Minister Golda Meir. But his reputation began to deteriorate in the 1960s when Rolf Hochhuth's play \"The Deputy\" accused the pope of being silent in the face of the Nazi extermination of Jews. Other books critical of Pius XII followed, such as \"Hitler's Pope,\" by John Cornwell in 1999, and \"Under His Very Windows\" by Susan Zuccotti in 2000. In January this year, the Miami Jewish Film Festival premiered a documentary entitled \"Holy Silence\" that also questioned whether Pius XII did enough to help save Jews from the Holocaust.One of the Vatican's chief archivists, Johan Ickx, said the accusations against Pius XII were unfounded.\"He was not at all silent,\" Ickx said. \"All of his priests in central Europe and the north of Europe were actively doing nothing else than trying to save people, Jews as well, all people, because that was one of their charges.\"Scholars will be allowed into the Vatican archives to study the files.Ickx says scholars from all nations and religions are welcome, so long as \"they have studied a little bit at university to know what they are dealing with.\"A group of scholars from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum will be among those studying the papers.Rosensaft stressed it was too early to speculate on what the archives might disclose, but he hopes it will allow historians to have all the facts.\"We can't rewrite history,\" Rosensaft said, \"but history has to be written based on full evidence and that is what we're looking for.\"This story has been corrected to better reflect the group of scholars studying the papers from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.",

Sergio Aguero opened the scoring for the reigning Premier League champions in the 20th minute shortly before Rodri doubled the lead, heading in from a corner that was controversially awarded.Villa's Tanzanian striker Mbwana Samatta got a goal back on the stroke of half-time, but an equalizer proved elusive. Belgian defender Bj\u00f6rn Engels went closest to taking the game to extra time, his header saved onto the post by City goalkeeper Claudio Bravo with a few minutes remaining.READ: Top German clubs play out bizarre conclusion to game over fans' offensive bannerRead MoreManchester City players celebrate the first goal scored by Aguero.With the Premier League title all but wrapped up -- Liverpool is 22 points clear although on Saturday it lost its first game of the season against Watford -- Manchester City are vying for a cup treble. The club has qualified for the fifth round of the FA Cup and leads Real Madrid 2-1 on aggregate in the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League. Coming off the back of a draining victory away in Madrid during the week, City boss Pep Guardiola made eight changes to the starting lineup, and the new players soon rewarded his selection. \"Three times in a row is a big success. It's the consistency, incredible,\" the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich manager said after the win. \"It was awesome. We struggled in the first minutes and the last ones. They had two clear chances in the first minutes but we played really well, especially in the second half.\"The game was good. Phil (Foden) was clinical. Big success, our second title of the season with the Community Shield, it's so nice. \"We've won a lot. I tried when we arrive, every game we play we try to win it, every competition we try to win it, and three times in a row, being here and winning is great.\"Guardiola celebrates with his backroom staff.One of the players to come in, 19-year-old Phil Foden, played a key role in the opening goal, heading back for Aguero to poke home. \"The goal, for me, it's important when the team is winning, so I am so happy for the goal but I am happy because we are winning the cup,\" the Argentine told Sky Sports after the game.City's second goal was accompanied with a huge slice of controversy. A corner was awarded to the reigning champions, despite it looking like it came off a Manchester City player last. Spanish midfielder Rodri compounded Villa's misery, heading home to put City well on their way to defending its crown. \"We know they are a really tough team because they are really tall and strong, so we knew we could never give up. I am happy for the team because it's tough being here,\" the Spanish international said.But Villa didn't go down without a fight and it was helped by an unfortunate slip from City defender John Stones, which allowed Anwar El Ghazi to swing in a lovely cross which Samatta headed home.

Smer had been in power for over a decade but came under fire following the 2018 murder of journalist Jan Kuciak and his fianc\u00e9e Martina Kusnirova.The young couple were shot dead after Kuciak reported on tax evasion and fraud among Slovak businesspeople connected to Smer.Candles placed in front of a portrait of Slovak investigative journalist Jan Kuciak and his girlfriend Martina Kusnirova.The killings prompted some of Slovakia's biggest anti-government protests since the communist era.

We're better being over cautious than getting the event turned away but right now the feedback has been good.\"Organizers wrote to the ATP and WTA to explain why they were staging the event -- though they didn't need approval from either for it to go ahead -- and both governing bodies gave the tournament their blessing and were pleased players would have a source of income, Rapson says.The event has also complied with all regulations set out by the Tennis Integrity Unit, the organization responsible for investigating match fixing in tennis.JUST WATCHEDTime Out with ATP star Milos Raonic: Quarantine life and Wimbledon cancellationReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTime Out with ATP star Milos Raonic: Quarantine life and Wimbledon cancellation 02:30Players' incomesThe tournament format is an eight-player round robin followed by a playoff between the top four on the final day to decide who finishes first, with prize money allocated accordingly on top of appearances fees.Matches are best-of-three sets and sets are shortened to the first to four games, with tiebreaks at three-all and next point wins when games reach deuce.Tennis fans worried this tournament is a one-off will be relieved to hear that Rapson has two more lined up in Germany and another four in Atlanta in the US -- the first of which gets underway on May 11 -- featuring names such as Donald Young, Taylor Townsend and Shelby Rogers.However, he dismissed the idea of similar events being held in places around the world where many of the top ranked players reside, such as Spain, France or Miami, and will continue helping lower-ranked players earn an income during the coronavirus pandemic.\"In normal business, your biggest asset usually takes the biggest return and unfortunately in tennis -- and all sports -- it doesn't necessarily reflect what happens in normal business,\" Rapson says.\"The players are the biggest asset in this sport, right, but they usually don't get the biggest share.

        "content": "(CNN)Germany announced Thursday it has designated the Lebanese militant and political group Hezbollah a terror organization, banning all of its activities in the country and ordering raids on sites police say are linked to the group.Police told CNN a number of properties in Berlin, Bremen and North Rhine-Westphalia were searched early on Thursday. According to the police and the German Interior Ministry, four mosques and cultural associations were raided, as well as private homes of their board members, treasurers and tax advisers.Police investigate the Hezbollah-linked Imam Mahdi center in Muenster, western Germany, on Thursday.\"The associations under investigation are suspected of forming part of Hezbollah due to their financial support and propaganda for the terrorist organization,\" the Interior Ministry said in a statement posted on its website. It added the searches were conducted to \"ensure that evidence of potential sub-organizations in Germany could not be destroyed when this ban was announced.\"The move to ban Hezbollah's activities in Germany comes after a sustained campaign by the United States and Israel. Last December, the German parliament approved a motion. It has argued for Chancellor Angela Merkel's government to ban the group's activities in Germany.The ban could hit Lebanon's coronavirus responseAnalysis by Tamara QiblawiGermany's move to classify Hezbollah as a terror group could have a direct impact on Lebanon's response to the coronavirus. Here's how:The European Union, so far, distinguishes between the group's political and military wings, with the latter only classified as a terror group.By making this distinction, the EU can legally engage with democratically elected officials from the organization, in addition to Hezbollah-linked ministries in Lebanon. Two of the country's 20 ministers are affiliated with the group.Lebanon's Health Minister Hassan Hamad, who has spearheaded a largely successful campaign to stem the spread of the virus, is backed by Hezbollah. If the EU chooses to follow Germany's lead, it could potentially deprive the country's struggling health sector of badly needed funds, and reignite a coronavirus crisis.This would happen as Lebanon grapples with its worst financial crisis in decades, and as social unrest hits the country's major cities again for the first time in months.\"As the authority responsible for issuing the ban, the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community is of the opinion that Hezbollah openly calls for the violent elimination of the State of Israel and questions the right of the State of Israel to exist,\" the ministry said in the statement. Read More\"The organization is therefore fundamentally against the concept of international understanding, regardless of whether it presents itself as a political, social or military structure,\" it added. CNN has reached out to Hezbollah for comment.The group is the dominating elected political and military force in Lebanon. It grew out of an Israeli occupation during Lebanon's civil war and has been strongly backed by Iran financially and militarily. The US and Israel have praised the decision that puts Germany at odds with the European Union, which in 2013 designated Hezbollah's military wing but not its political arm. The Iranian-backed Lebanese Shiite group is a strong force in Lebanese politics, which is the reason why some European countries are reluctant to ban the group in its entirety.The UK put the group as a whole on its terror blacklist in March 2019. The US, Canada, the Netherlands, Israel, the Gulf Cooperation Council and Bahrain also designates the group in its entirety as a terrorist organization.\"We applaud the German government's actions today against suspected Hizballah supporters. The government's decision to act reflects the resolve of the West to confront the global threat posed by Hizballah,\" the US Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell said in a statement.Israel's Minister of Foreign Affairs Israel Katz called the ban \"a valuable and significant step in the global fight against terrorism.\"\"I call on additional European countries and the European Union to adopt this necessary policy and to recognize organization for what it is: Hezbollah -- both its military and political wings -- constitutes a terror organization, and that is how it must be treated,\" Katz said in a statement.",

        "content": "Moscow (CNN)The coronavirus pandemic has put the spotlight on the risks faced by frontline health workers, and Russia is no exception. Medical facilities in the country have emerged as one of the main breeding grounds for Covid-19, and two dozen hospitals have had to shut down for long quarantines, with many doctors falling sick.The numbers are stark. On Thursday, Russia's total number of reported coronavirus cases surpassed the 100,000 mark, exceeding numbers reported from Iran and China. And of 285 coronavirus hotspots the country is trying to contain, 64% are in hospitals, said Alexander Gorelov, an epidemiologist at the state wellbeing agency Rospotrebnadzor, at a recent meeting chaired by President Vladimir Putin.For weeks, Russian independent media and non-governmental organizations have reported anonymous pleas from outraged medical workers who said they had been ordered to the frontlines of a public health crisis without adequate protection, and that bureaucratic foot-dragging was costing lives. As the situation worsens, many have become more outspoken, sometimes risking legal action against them.  Russian Prime Minister tests positive for Covid-19One high-profile example is St. Petersburg's Vreden Institute for Traumatology and Orthopedics. Three weeks ago, authorities ordered around 500 patients and medical personnel into lockdown amid a coronavirus outbreak, with the local press dubbing the hospital \"Russia's Diamond Princess\" -- a reference to the cruise ship that docked in Japan after a massive onboard outbreak. Initially, the quarantine was supposed to end last week, but public health officials later said the center will stay closed \"until further notice.\" On Sunday, April 26, a health worker at the hospital posted a cry for help on YouTube.Read More\"I'm coughing, my chest hurts but there is no one to look at it... there is no treatment and no medicine,\" the woman said. \"No one came to check on us, how we feel, what is the plan for us ... when will this end?\"Approximately, 300 people inside Vreden Institute have contracted Covid-19, Rashid Tikhilov, the head of the hospital, told the state-run news agency TASS. Head of the spinal surgery ward in that hospital, Dmitry Ptashnikov, said in an Instagram post all doctors in his department contracted the coronavirus. In an interview with Kommersant daily, he said the first Covid-19 case was diagnosed April 9th using CT scans but the actual test confirmation came later.Coronavirus deals blow to Putin's plans to stay in power until 2036Vreden Institute did not respond to CNN's request for comment but interim director of the institute Andrey Cherniy said in an Instagram video there were \"objective difficulties\" with testing and lags in getting the results back from the lab.According to Cherniy, they were able to streamline the testing process recently and set up a \"green zone\" to place people who tested negative twice for later discharge.  He thanked hospital staff and patients for their patience, adding that the facility has necessary meds in stock and is working to purchase protective gear.Two employees at the institute said on condition of anonymity that there has been no adequate protective gear and many doctors who were tested did not get their results back. The lung scans, they said, showed pneumonia. \"All my friends there are sick ... 80% of my colleagues,\" one of the health care workers told CNN. \"[Nurses] are sick but still have to be there and change IVs for the patients.\" Some patients with serious conditions were able to transfer to other clinics. Those who have to stay are on the verge of a breakdown, according to the woman in the YouTube video.  Medical workers wait to enter the red zone to treat coronavirus patients at the Spasokukotsky clinical hospital in Moscow on April 22.The Vreden Institute is not the only hospital dealing with this. At least 23 wards across Russia had to shut down for quarantine in April, according to a CNN tally based on media reports and official statements.  There are no official statistics on the nationwide number of infected health professionals, Russia's Health Ministry and Rospotrebnadzor did not respond to a request for comment. Some of the quarantined wards were designated for Covid-19, but the majority were regular hospitals, maternity clinics or psychiatric wards where the coronavirus patients were first admitted with other health issues, and where doctors did not have personal protective equipment (PPE), according to reports by the Alliance of Doctors union.  How Russia is using authoritarian tech to curb coronavirusMeanwhile, Putin has come under criticism at home for sending planeloads of protective gear to the United States, Italy, and Serbia, while some Russian doctors have had to sew their own masks and buy protective clothing from hardware stores, according to independent media and reports by the Action medical labor union. The Kremlin has acknowledged the shortages. In a teleconference Tuesday, with regional leaders, Putin said the government had \"put the brakes\" on the spread of the coronavirus but admitted hospitals and medical personnel still did not have enough protective equipment.\"Compared to what [production] was before, it's a lot,\" he said. \"But compared to what we need now, it's still not enough. Some doctors complain that hospitals have stopped testing their employees altogether in order to avoid mandatory quarantines.  According to Andrey Konoval, the head of Action, a positive test for one doctor means quarantine for most colleagues, so there could be no one left to work.\"In that sense, the battle is lost,\" he said. \"Recently, we've seen more and more instances when the employer wittingly refuses to test the staff to hide the real picture.\"Moscow ambulance workers also complain they are feeling the repercussions of understaffing. Artyom, an ambulance worker who asked CNN not to disclose his last name, said his team was equipped with PPE, but was responding to a snowballing number of calls in a 24-hour shift with few breaks.Russian President Vladimir Putin chairs a video conference meeting with heads of Russia's regions over the coronavirus situation on Tuesday.According to Russian regulations, one ambulance team should consist of a driver and two paramedics. But Artyom said he hadn't seen a full team in weeks because half of his colleagues are on sick leave with no one to replace them. Both Artyom and Konoval said there were not enough nurses and paramedics even before the pandemic, and blamed a controversial healthcare reform that led to mass job cuts and closures of hospitals, including infectious disease centers.Russia's underfunded regional hospitals have been hit by the gear shortages even more, and in many places, the authorities are still slow to respond to the pleas. On April 20, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin singled out several regions that used less than 10% of the allocated federal funds to buy protective gear and oxygen systems for hospitals.To move ahead of the curve, doctors have turned to activists and NGOs to lobby for the equipment they need. But speaking out publicly can have consequences: investigative committees in at least five regions have called in the authors of social media posts for questioning, according to a CNN tally.Coronavirus takes a serious turn in Russia, and Putin no longer radiates confidenceThe Alliance of Doctors said on Twitter that some health care workers have been threatened with fines for spreading fakes news about the lack of equipment.\"We have gathered over 200 requests, there is deficit of everything, but especially protective suits, respirators and eyewear,\" union communications director Ivan Konovalov said. \"Absolutely all regions are in need, including Moscow.\"Russia's Federal Security Service, or the FSB, has requested statistics from the Alliance of Doctors about the complaints they receive.Meanwhile, the doctors are counting their own dead. A group of doctors set up a website called \"List of memory\" asking colleagues across the country to submit names of those who have died of coronavirus complications. \"The only idea here is not to forget the colleagues that died,\" one of the co-creators of the project, Moscow-based cardiologist Aleksey Erlich, told independent outlet Meduza.As of Wednesday, the list had over 70 names, but the organizers say it is far from complete, as it has been difficult to get official confirmation of cause of death. Russia has released no official numbers yet on health worker fatalities, though Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has acknowledged \"sad news\" regarding the death of frontline medical personnel.",

        "content": "(CNN)Sweden has been an outlier during the coronavirus outbreak. The country has not joined many of its European neighbors in imposing strict limits on citizens' lives, and images of people heading to work on busy streets, or chatting at cafes and bars have raised eyebrows.Younger children have continued to go to school, although universities and schools for older students have switched to distance learning. Businesses -- from hair salons to restaurants -- have remained open, although people have been advised to work from home where possible. On April 7, the government introduced a bill allowing it to act quickly and take decisions on temporary measures where needed. Care home visits were banned from April 1 and the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs asked people to refrain from non-essential travel, adding: \"Keep your distance and take personal responsibility.\"Among Nordic countries -- which share similar cultural, geographical and sociological attributes -- the contrast with Sweden is great. Finland declared a state of emergency, closed schools and banned gatherings of more than 10 people on March 16, restricted travel to and from its Uusimaa region on March 28 and closed restaurants, cafes and bars on April 1.      Denmark announced widespread closures on March 11 and was among the first in Europe to close borders, shops, schools and restaurants, and to ban large gatherings. Norway began introducing travel restrictions in mid-March and has since closed schools and daycare centers, banned the use of vacation properties, canceled events and closed businesses such as hair and beauty salons.Read MoreThe death rate in Sweden has now risen significantly higher than many other countries in Europe, reaching more than 22 per 100,000 people, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University, controlled for population. By contrast, Denmark has recorded just over seven deaths per 100,000 people, and both Norway and Finland less than four.Sweden has registered 18,926 coronavirus cases and 2,274 deaths among its population of 10.3 million people. Denmark has had 9,049 cases and 427 deaths in a population of 5.8 million, Norway 7,599 cases and 206 deaths among its 5.4 million people, and Finland 4,695 cases and 193 deaths in its population of 5.5 million.Denmark and Norway are now beginning to ease their lockdowns, with children returning to school in the past 10 days, in smaller classes with markers to help keep them two meters apart. Salons and other businesses with one-to-one contact will reopen in Norway from Monday. Finland has extended its restrictions until May 13.     Further afield the Czech Republic, which has a similar-sized population -- 10.7 million -- to Sweden, has recorded 7,449 cases and 223 deaths -- around two deaths per 100,000 people. It took a markedly different approach to the pandemic by shutting schools, closing restaurants and bars and most stores, restricting travel and ordering mandatory quarantines for travelers from at-risk regions in early March. It has also made it compulsory for people to wear face masks in public. Sweden has not had as many deaths as Italy or Spain, which have recorded around 45 and 51 deaths per 100,000 people respectively, or even the UK, where there have been about 32 deaths per 100,000 of the population. But there are various complex differences between Sweden and these countries that make direct comparisons harder, such as Italy having an older population, more smokers, and a larger number of close-knit multigenerational households.People enjoy the warm spring weather as they sit by the water at Hornstull in Stockholm on April 21.The Swedish approachOn March 28, a petition signed by 2,000 Swedish researchers, including Carl-Henrik Heldin, chairman of the Nobel Foundation, called for the nation's government to \"immediately take steps to comply with the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendations.\"The scientists added: \"The measures should aim to severely limit contact between people in society and to greatly increase the capacity to test people for Covid-19 infection.\"\"These measures must be in place as soon as possible, as is currently the case in our European neighboring countries,\" they wrote. \"Our country should not be an exception to the work to curb the pandemic.\"An employee wears a vest reading \"Keep distance. Stop Covid-19\" as customers look at plants at the Slottstradgarden Ulriksdal garden centre in the Ulriksdal Palace park in Stockholm on April 21.The petition said that trying to \"create a herd immunity, in the same way that occurs during an influenza epidemic, has low scientific support.\"Swedish authorities have denied having a strategy to create herd immunity, one the UK government was rumored to be working towards earlier on in the pandemic -- leading to widespread criticism -- before it enforced a strict lockdown.Lena Hallengren, Swedish Minister for Health and Social Affairs, told CNN: \"There is no strategy to create herd immunity in response to Covid-19 in Sweden. Sweden shares the same goals as all other countries -- to save lives and protect public health.\"Jan Albert, a professor in the Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology at the Karolinska Institutet, told CNN: \"It's clear that Sweden had more deaths [than many other European countries] up until now, and that's probably at least in part because we haven't had as strict a lockdown and not a lockdown enforced by law.\"But he said he believed the majority of scientists in Sweden had been \"relatively quiet\" about the herd immunity plan because they thought it could work.A nurse checks on a Covid-19 patient in the Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) department of the Karolinska Hospital in Solna, near Stockholm, Sweden, on April 19.\"What's the strategy of the other countries?\" he asked. \"It [herd immunity] was already the only thing that will eventually stop this, unless there is a vaccine in time, which is quite unlikely. \"The truth is that no one, no one in Sweden, no one elsewhere either, knows what the best strategy is. Time will tell.\"He said that he believed that stricter lockdowns \"only serve to flatten the curve and flattening the curve doesn't mean that cases disappear -- they are just moved in time.\"\"And as long as the healthcare system reasonably can cope with and give good care to the ones that need care, it's not clear that having the cases later in time is better.\"Tables are covered up outside shuttered restaurants in the popular tourist area of Nyhavn in Copenhagen, Denmark, on April 15.Protecting the systemAlbert believes that Sweden's healthcare system is coping, as does Peter Lindgren, managing director at the Swedish Institute for Health Economics (IHE). Lindgren told CNN that the number of people treated in intensive care units over several weeks had been stable, \"so in that aspect it has to be successful.\"But he added: \"What it failed at, I think, is that there has been disease transmitted into elderly care facilities. We have deaths occurring as a consequence of that.\"Hallengren, the Swedish health minister, told CNN: \"One of the main concerns now in Sweden is to strengthen the protection for those living in care homes for older people.\"She said it was still \"far too early to draw any firm conclusions as to the effectiveness of the measures taken in Sweden.\"Cars at a traffic control post in Hyvinkaa, Finland, on April 15, during the lockdown of Uusimaa, the nation's most populous region.She said that just because Sweden did not have a \"full lockdown\" did not mean \"that it's business as usual\" and that measure were being \"continuously reassessed\" with the help of experts \"to ensure that the right measures are taken at the right time.\"Gatherings of more than 50 people are banned and people are \"strongly recommended\" to avoid non-essential domestic travel, she added.Sweden's foreign minister on Monday told UK newspaper The Guardian that it was far too soon to judge her country's approach to Covid-19.\"There's been a lot of misunderstanding,\" Ann Linde said. \"We have pretty much the same goals as every other government ... And as we have always said, we are perfectly ready to go with more binding regulations if the population does not follow.\"She said the fairly high death toll was \"certainly not part of the plan\" and said the high number of care home deaths was \"one area where we have failed.\"The Swedish Public Health Agency this week forecast that almost a third of people in Stockholm County would have been infected by Covid-19 by May 1. That would be more than 600,000 people -- far higher than the number of cases recorded nationally so far. Less than 24 hours later, there was confusion when the health agency announced on Twitter that it had \"detected errors\" in the report, but it then said its mathematical model had been updated and reiterated that 26% of the Stockholm population would have been infected by May 1.It said that there were approximately 75 unconfirmed cases for each reported case of Covid-19 -- but that the peak of the spread of infection had passed.Related storiesWhat is herd immunity?Trump challenges Swedish strategyUnusual tactics to fight coronavirusTrack the spread of the virusSweden's state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell said on Friday that his country would likely be in a better place to withstand a second wave of coronavirus because so many people in Sweden have now been exposed to the virus.He told the BBC that the relatively relaxed approach had \"worked in some aspects,\" since there had always been at least 20% of intensive care beds empty and able to take care of Covid-19 patients. \"We believe we passed the peak of the transmission a week ago,\" he added.Asked whether Sweden's approach will help it withstand a possible second wave, Tegnell said he believed it would. \"It will definitely affect the reproduction rate and slow down the spread,\" he said, but added that it wouldn't be enough to achieve \"herd immunity.\"\"We know very little about the immunity of this disease, but most of the experts in Sweden agree that some kind of immunity we definitely will have because a lot of people that have been tested so far have produced antibodies ... We hope this will make it easier for us in the long run.\"Asked whether the death toll would have been lower if Sweden had followed the same path as other European countries in introducing strict restrictions, Tegnell replied: \"That's a very difficult question to answer at this stage. At least 50% of our death toll is within the elderly homes and we have a hard time understanding how a lockdown would stop the introduction of the disease into the elderly homes.\"Whether Sweden's Covid-19 strategy has succeeded or failed may not be clear for months to come, but as countries across the globe count their dead and wonder whether they could have done more to halt the spread of the virus, the world will be watching. This story has been updated with the latest figures.

But that hasn't stopped, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, who has just revealed that she has taken up ballet. Prince Charles' wife said she took up the discipline after some initial skepticism. The 72-year-old duchess made her surprise confession in a video call to promote Silver Swans online classes, which aim to encourage over-55s to have a go at ballet during the coronavirus lockdown. 'I couldn't believe how good everybody was,' the duchess said of the Silver Swans class she watched.As newly appointed vice-patron of ballet education organization the Royal Academy of Dance (RAD), Camilla shared her experiences in a conversation with retired ballerina Dame Darcey Bussell, who is president of the academy, and broadcaster Angela Rippon, who is an ambassador for the Silver Swans initiative, which offers classes all over the world. Read MoreThe duchess first watched a Silver Swans class during a visit to the academy in 2018, after which she decided to try ballet. She told Rippon and Bussell: \"I thought, 'Oh dear, what on earth is this going to be?' I thought it's going to be a lot of very ancient people like me, wobbling about on one leg.\"You can finally learn to dance because of coronavirusBut the performance could not have been more different, she said. \"I couldn't believe how good everybody was. They were so impressive!\"Since then she has been taking regular classes with several \"ancient friends,\" the duchess revealed. \"I thought it was going to be very funny and I was going to laugh at everybody toppling over, but I think we concentrate so hard we don't even know what our friend next door is doing.\"Believed to be spending lockdown at the couple's home on the Balmoral estate in Scotland, Camilla was filmed in front of a fireplace topped with a circular mirror. Royal Ballet dancers keep moving under lockdownWhen asked how she was passing the time, she described it as \"very peculiar,\" adding that everything in her diary had been \"scratched out.\"Offering an insight into her husband, who recently recovered from a mild case of coronavirus, she said: \"My husband is a workaholic, so he will work wherever he is. He's sitting at his desk now working away. \"We try and do something for all our charities most days to try and give them a bit of encouragement and just try to lend our support.\"Exercising is also key, the duchess said. \"I think we have all got to keep active -- if we don't we will just seize up and, you know, we won't be able to get out of bed in the morning. It doesn't matter what it is, 10 minutes or 20 minutes, it just starts off the day and I do a sort of combination: a bit of Silver Swans and a bit of pilates and a lot of walking, which I love.\"The duchess said it was a \"real honor\" to take on the new role as vice-patron alongside Queen Elizabeth II, who has been the academy's patron since 1953. \"I think dancing makes you happy,\" she said. \"I'm very, very much a beginner and probably will always remain a beginner, but I do feel after a year, 18 months, of doing it that maybe I have improved a tiny bit. But I'm certainly not going to be taking to the stage. I shall keep it in my own home.\"This story has been updated.",

And in June 2019, we came to believe that she had most likely been killed,\" police said.Police search the Hagens' home near Oslo, after Tom Hagen's arrest.\"We now believe there was no abduction and there was never any genuine negotiations. In other words there was a clear and well-planned attempt at misleading the police,\" the statement added.The Norwegian legal system allows police to hold an individual on suspicion of a crime before formal charges are brought.Hagen's attorney, Svein Holden, said his client denies the accusations.\"He strongly maintains that he has nothing to do with this,\" he told a group of reporters, according to Reuters.Hagen will appear in court on Wednesday, the news agency reports.Police asked the court to remand Hagen in custody for four weeks, with a ban on visits and outside communication, according to the statement.Ransom demanded in suspected kidnapping of Norwegian businessman's wifeThey initially kept Anne-Elisabeth's disappearance a secret in a bid to protect her but then made the case public in January 2019.\"We can confirm that there is a ransom, and that serious threats have been issued,\" \u00d8ystein Stavdal Paulsen, senior adviser of Norway's East Police District, told CNN at the time.\"Regarding the ransom, we do not want to confirm what amount or in what form,\" he added.NRK reported at the time that multiple messages were found inside the Hagens' home and that a ransom had been demanded in the cryptocurrency Monero.Hagen, a real estate investor and power facilities owner, is one of Norway's richest men, with a net worth of around $200 million, according to Norwegian financial magazine Kapital.Anne-Elisabeth Hagen was a board member of her husband's holding company until September, according to NRK.The couple lived in Fjellhamar, a village about 12 miles northeast of Oslo, according to Norwegian public broadcaster NRK. The couple married in 1979 and have three adult children, it said.",

        "content": "(CNN)If life had gone to plan, Tuesday, April 28 should have been a day for Major League Soccer side Montreal Impact to prepare for the upcoming home match against Orlando City. New head coach Thierry Henry had made an encouraging start to management in North America, going unbeaten in the league, until the coronavirus pandemic effectively stopped the world in its tracks. So rather than the football calendar offering up the UEFA Champions League semifinal for Henry to enjoy as had been originally scheduled, the legendary striker, who won a World Cup for France and multiple trophies for the likes of Barcelona and Arsenal, is instead addressing reporters over video conference. From \"Va Va Voom\" -- for those who recall the quintessential Renault advert Henry starred in -- to \"Va Va Zoom,\" if you will. Despite a lack of football, the timing of the call was almost as good as Henry's timing in front of goal. He was speaking just hours after his homeland confirmed the top two divisions would not resume the 2019-20 season in light of the country banning all sporting events, including behind closed doors, until September. Read MoreREAD: From Senegal to superhero, but Sadio Mane's story isn't pure fantasyHenry looks on against New England Revolution.It is not yet known whether the campaign will be abandoned, with no decision announced on who will be crowned champion or the teams that will be promoted or relegated. While promotion/relegation are not of concern to MLS -- who are yet to embrace the concept -- did Henry hope for a resumption of the 2020 season, or would he prefer the league to follow in the footsteps of France and the Netherlands, who declared its topflight null and void last week? \"I'm sure the Commissioner and whoever is involved to take that decision are working obviously extremely hard to find out what we are about to do,\" Henry tells CNN Sport in reference to MLS being suspended indefinitely in March, and not restarting before June 8 at the earliest. \"They are going to take the decision and we are going to have execute whatever they want us to execute. But on my side, all I can do is try to keep my team, the staff, prepared to whatever is going to come our way. \"I've seen people took one way and one path. I don't know what's going to happen with the league. We just have to wait and see and be ready for whatever is going to come our way.\"Henry celebrates scoring Arsenal's third goal against Inter Milan.At this point in time, Henry is more concerned about the health and safety of friends and family back in France, and the state of the planet itself, as opposed to what the footballing authorities decide in the land of his birth. \"It's very difficult for me to talk about...what happened in France and why they took that decision,\" Henry, who is Arsenal's record goalscorer, says. \"Obviously we are all one country right now, either way, wherever you are. We all are worried about our families. I try to speak with my family as much as I can, see how they are doing, how they are coping with everything that's happening.\"As for how Henry himself is coping, it's not only the regular rhythms of his daily routine which keep him occupied -- \"(I) work out, cook, relax a bit, go back to working out. Sometimes I will watch some games that I've seen. Cook again at night\" -- but one of the deadliest finishers of his generation is now confronted by a new opponent: the eradicating of germs. \"I don't know if it's the same for you,\" the 42-year-old jokes, \"but it seems like you need to clean the house every two minutes. Because usually you're not at home so you're not cooking that much, so you always have to wash the dishes, clean the house. So the usual stuff that I don't usually do.\" READ: David Beckham reflects on newly formed Inter Miami's 'long, tough journey'Henry with Lionel Messi (left) and Zlatan Ibrahimovic (middle) at Barcelona.On the upOne criticism of MLS from the days when Henry still cleaned up in front of goal -- he played for the New York Red Bulls between 2010 and 2014 -- was that players were coming over from Europe in the twilight of their careers for one final paycheck, rather than go gracefully into retirement. Indeed, Henry moved to the Red Bulls just shy of his 33rd birthday in 2010. He is positively gushing when asked about the differences on the field now compared to during his playing days. \"The league was always trying to get guys at the end of their contract and try to see if they will come or not,\" he recalled. \"Now, teams are going and getting those players early...so that's a sign that the league is evolving.\"Henry takes to the field for the game against the Chicago Fire.But while MLS continues to grow by gradually reducing the average age, Henry, who was notoriously difficult to please on the pitch, is preaching patience when it comes to the current era, which has been described as MLS 3.0. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos\"It's the 25th anniversary of the league this year,\" Henry concludes. \"You have clubs in Europe that are 125 years old. It's difficult to battle this...I don't know how far the league can go. \"It's up to us obviously; now I'm back in to make sure that we can elevate the league as much as we can. This league has no limits for me, but you need time to reach that level.\"",

        "content": "London (CNN)A 1,000-year-old water mill in southwest England, which previously witnessed global pandemics such as the plague in the 17th century and the 1918 influenza pandemic, has resumed production to meet demand for flour during the current coronavirus outbreak.The Sturminster Newton Mill was last fully operational in 1970, before becoming a museum and normally producing flour just two days a month during the summer.It has now produced more than 2,200 pounds of flour in the last few weeks, the same amount as it would usually produce in an entire year.Pete Loosmoore, the supervisor of the historic mill, told CNN: \"We were set to open for the season when the coronavirus hit. Our first reaction was we have to close down and pack up.\"\"But we realized that many local shops had no flour in them and people were desperate for it.\"Read MoreWith the mill closed to visitors, \"we had a couple of tonnes of good quality milling wheat that we could use,\" added Loosmore.Baking during a pandemic can reduce stress and provide comfort It takes the mill a day to produce 66 pounds (30 kilograms) of bread flour, and so far the team of volunteer millers have delivered more than two hundred 3.3-pound (1.5kg) bags of flour to local shops and bakeries.Loosmore hopes \"it will boost local shops\" and said that \"on the whole, everybody seems to be very happy with it.\"There is evidence of a mill being on the site since 1016 -- predating the Norman invasion -- and it was mentioned in the Domesday Book, a vast survey of life in Norman England ordered by William the Conqueror and published in 1086.The current mill was built in 1556, a few years before Queen Elizabeth I took to the throne and more than 200 years before the United States Declaration of Independence. It was upgraded in 1904.UK shoppers have been experiencing shortages of flour on supermarket shelves. As lockdown measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 continue, people staying at home have been baking more and \"both regular bulk buyers and consumers have been purchasing much more than normal,\" the National Association of British & Irish Millers (NABIM) said.On average the UK's 27.4 million households buy one bag of flour roughly every three months, according to the NABIM's latest figures.While the UK is self-sufficient in flour, producing about 100,000 tons (90,000 tonnes) a week, the \"production is limited by the capacity to pack small bags,\" according to NABIM.The industry is now running at full capacity, packing 3.5 to 4 million bags of flour a week to meet demand.",

        "content": "(CNN)In the early 1980s, the NFL Draft was held in a New York hotel conference room on a Tuesday morning. The \"annual player selection meeting\" as it was called back then had only team executives in attendance and was broadcast on a brand-new cable network, ESPN, that had to convince the league this was something people would want to watch. But now it's one of the most anticipated and talked about events on the American sports calendar. Last year over 600,000 filled the streets of downtown Nashville for the three-day extravaganza. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced teams' selections from a studio in the basement of his home in Bronxville, New York.This year's draft was supposed to be held on a floating stage in front of the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas. Read MoreBut because of the coronavirus pandemic, those lavish plans were scrapped, and the first-ever virtual draft was born. Everyone, from the commissioner Roger Goodell, to players, team execs and even fans in their own homes, connected only through the internet and TV sets. And it delivered in a big way.The American sports fanSome NFL commentators were skeptical about whether the league should be holding a draft while so many were in the midst of massive suffering and loss during this coronavirus pandemic. But an opening montage narrated by Super Bowl winning quarterback Peyton Manning centering around hope set the perfect tone for a draft like no other. 'I went from palm trees to snowmen but couldn't have been happier.' This is what it's like to be drafted into the NFLThe broadcast sprinkled in dozens of message`s from current and former players thanking health care workers and others fighting the virus. And the league held a Draft-A-Thon during the broadcast, raising more than $6.7 million over the three days, adding to the more than $100 million the league has helped raise for agencies assisting those in need during the pandemic. It was respectful yet fun and just what sports fans in the U.S. needed after going more than a month without a major live sporting event. The league says more than 55 million fans tuned into the three-day event, setting a new record.TechnologyAfter some early hiccups in a dress rehearsal, everything seemed to go without a hitch, at least to the average viewer. Commissioner Roger Goodell announced the picks in front of a TV in his basement and even offered fans the chance to virtually boo him (a draft night tradition) as he came on TV. The league gave over 60 prospects video equipment to capture the moment they were selected. The cheers and tears that followed were heartfelt and beautiful to watch.  And it was great to see some emotional moments from team owners, coaches and executives as well. Fans gained unprecedented acces as Draft \"war rooms\" were replaced this year by the home Draft set-ups of GMs and coaches across the league - even the most secretive of coaches, Bill Belichick, was forced to allow cameras inside his home. Many of them celebrated the picks they made with their families, something they don't get to do when they're all huddled in team facilities all weekend.We even saw New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick's dog sitting in front of his computer at the dinner table. You'll never see that at a draft again.The Brady-less PatriotsAfter losing six-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in free agency, the Patriots were hoping to draft a quarterback with one of their ten picks in the draft. But it didn't happen. Bill Belichick said that wasn't by design but the right quarterback wasn't there when their time came up to pick. That leaves Jarrett Stidham and Brian Hoyer on the roster. Could the Pats be vying for another quarterback before next season starts or will they have to star with an unproven leader of their offense?Tom Brady and the BucsAfter signing Tom Brady and trading for Rob Gronkowski, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers draft choices solidified the team's position as winners of the off-season.Brady is joining some elite offensive talent in Tampa Bay, including the addition of his former teammate Rob Gronkowski last week. But they needed some help on the offensive line and they got it with their first-round pick Tristan Wirfs. Then in the second round they helped their defense with cornerback Antoine Winfield Jr. Antonie Sr. was a cornerback in the league for 14 years and intercepted a pass from Brady back in 2001. Now Jr. will be playing with Brady in Tampa.Aaron Rodgers and the PackersAs a Green Bay supporter, it pains me to list them as a loser but I feel I have to. The Packers were one win away from the Super Bowl last year but their superstar quarterback seemed frustrated by the lack of production from his wide receivers. Thirty-seven receivers were taken in the draft, none of them by Green Bay.Future Hall of Fame quarterback Aaron Rodgers had said before the draft he hoped his Green Bay Packers would select a skill player in the first round, but instead they selected his replacement-elect Jordan Love from Utah State. Not only that, the Packers traded up in the first round to select quarterback Jordan Love. Rodgers was drafted late in the first round in 2005 and sat behind the legendary Brett Favre. Let's see how Rodgers will deal with having to compete with a quarterback taken late in the first round.Arryn SipossThree shoulder reconstructions forced the former Australian Football League player to quit the sport and turn his attention to American Football. He was hoping to get drafted after a successful career as a punter for Auburn University but that didn't happen. After the draft is over, players that are left undrafted are free to sign with any club and Siposs was the first to find a home, with the Detroit Lions signing him as a free agent minutes after the draft concluded. If Siposs makes the club, he'll be the 8th Australian in the NFL. Seven others born outside the U.S. were taken in the draft.",

Merkel warns Germany is on the 'thinnest ice' as Europe realizes social distancing is here to stayOn Monday, Germany received a shipment of 10 million face masks from China, and two further flights chartered by the German military are expected to deliver another 15 million protective masks as the wearing of masks has become mandatory in many public spaces across the country.From last week, many of the restrictions on public life that were designed to halt the spread of coronavirus were loosened in the country. Shops no larger than 800 square meters (8,600 sq. ft.) were allowed to reopen, as were car dealers and bicycle stores, regardless of size.A government spokesman said there was a worldwide shortage of protective equipment.According to the latest figures from Johns Hopkins University, there have been more than 159,000 reported cases of coronavirus in Germany. There have been more than 6,000 deaths. Chancellor Angela Merkel has cautioned against complacency, telling Germany's parliament that the country is \"still at the beginning\" of the coronavirus crisis and will have to live with the virus for a long time. \"Nobody likes to hear this but it is the truth. We are not living through the final phase of this crisis,\" she said last week.",

        "content": "(CNN)The Scottish government has advised people to wear face coverings in enclosed public spaces, in a break from the UK-wide approach to tackling the spread of coronavirus.Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister, said it could be beneficial for people to wear non-medical coverings in places where social distancing was difficult, such as on public transport and in shops. But the measure would not be compulsory, Sturgeon said, in part because there was no conclusive evidence that wearing face coverings can substantially stop the spread of coronavirus in the community. \"The evidence on the use of face coverings is limited, but there may be some benefit in wearing a facial covering when you leave the house and enter enclosed spaces,\" Sturgeon said on Tuesday, at a daily Scottish government briefing in Edinburgh. Germans face fines of up to $5,000 as wearing a face mask becomes mandatoryThe UK government appeared to be taken by surprise by Sturgeon's move. Downing Street said on Tuesday that it was yet to make a decision on face coverings for residents in England. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) have submitted evidence to ministers, and the government would announce a decision as soon as it was made, the Prime Minister's official spokesperson said, according to the PA Media news agency.Read MoreAt the UK government's daily briefing later, Deputy Chief Scientific Adviser Angela McLean said SAGE had concluded there was \"weak evidence of a small effect\" in which face masks could prevent an infected person passing coronavirus on to someone else. Cabinet minister Michael Gove said the government planned to increase domestic production of face coverings. \"I can confirm Lord Agnew, the joint Cabinet Office and Treasury minister, has launched a domestic effort to ensure we produce just such masks,\" Gove told the House of Commons on Tuesday.Sturgeon said she was not advising that people wear medical-grade masks. Instead, a Scottish government statement said that people could wear coverings \"made of cloth or other textiles and through which you can breathe, for example a scarf.\" Sturgeon also stressed that social distancing rules continued to apply and said people wearing masks were not  \"invincible.\" The four UK nations -- England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland -- have largely taken a coordinated approach to tackling coronavirus. But Scotland, which has its own legal system and has more devolved powers than the other nations, has diverged from the UK approach at some stages. Gatherings over 500 people were banned in Scotland on 12 March, more than a week before restrictions were imposed in the rest of the UK.JUST WATCHEDHow to make your own mask at homeReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHow to make your own mask at home 02:36The Downing Street spokesperson acknowledged Sturgeon's different approach.\"There have been points in the response so far where announcements have been made at ever so slightly different times. By and large we have moved forward with a single four-nations approach. I think the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have all said they hope that continues to be the case and we would agree with that.\"But Sturgeon is not alone in carving out a different path. First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford told The Guardian that the Welsh Assembly could lift the country's lockdown earlier than the rest of the UK if needed. \"We have the power to do it, definitely. I'd rather we did it together,\" he said.\"The Coronavirus Act does respect devolution. It puts the solution in our own hands and we have already done things differently in a range of different matters where that's been right for us.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Ever since Zion Williamson was 5 years old, he wanted to be a basketball star. But to get there, he needed a lot of encouragement and coaching along the way, and there was no one that better than his mother, Sharonda Sampson. \"My mom to this day is the hardest coach I've ever had,\" Williamson said in an interview published Monday on NBA's Twitter account. \"There were times when my stepdad would look at me and say 'you had a good game' and my mom would be like 'I don't know what you're talking about, you had 2 or 3 turnovers.\" Sampson should know. She coached Zion in every youth basketball league he ever played. Sampson was a collegiate track star and later became a middle school health and physical education teacher. She married Zion's biological father Lateef Williamson, who played American football in college. By the time he was five years old, Zion's parents divorced, and his mother married Lee Anderson, a collegiate basketball player. \"When I was like nine or 10, my stepfather and my mother would just say 'if you want to be one of the greatest, you've got to work when nobody's working,' so I'd get up at 5:30 a.m. and head to the outdoor court and play,\" Williamson told NBA broadcaster Ernie Johnson. Read MoreREAD: From Chinese controversy to Kobe's death and finally coronavirus; this NBA season will live long in the memoryWilliamson faces off against Derrick Jones Jr. of the Miami Heat.Zion's hard work and dedication began to pay off when he entered high school, where he became a YouTube sensation for his high-flying dunks and powerful moves. Even rap superstar Drake was wearing his high school jersey. But Sampson wanted her son to not only work hard at being great but study how the legends of the game went about their craft. \"When I started playing, my mom said there were three players she wanted me to watch -- Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and Michael Jordan,\" Williamson said. \"Even though I wasn't alive when he (Jordan) was doing those things, it just captured me. Everything he did was just incredible.\" The national spotlight shined on Zion during his one year of collegiate basketball at Duke University, where he was coached by five-time national champion Mike Krzyzewski. The most storied rivalry in the collegiate game is between Duke and North Carolina, where Jordan won a national championship back in the 1980s. Just 36 seconds into his first game against Carolina, Williamson's shoe blew out, causing him to sprain his knee. Zion was devastated. He cried in the training room and couldn't even bring himself to watch the rest of the game on TV. But that's when Sampson came into the room and provided the comfort and support her son really needed. \"She put her arms around me and said, 'It's OK, you'll be back before you know it,'\" Williamson remembered.

Who will eat that loss?Zion Williamson hugs fellow young star Luka Doncic of the Dallas Mavericks.Zion did come back as Duke's postseason began and led his Blue Devils to the NCAA Tournament's Elite 8, where they were eliminated 68-67 by Michigan State. Shortly after his freshman season, Williamson declared for the NBA Draft. Sampson was by her son's side when he was chosen by the Pelicans with the top overall pick. \"I wouldn't be here without my mom.\" said Williamson with tears streaming down his face after his selection. But injury struck again. Zion hurt the same knee in a Pelicans preseason game, forcing him to miss the first 44 games of his rookie season. When he returned, he was brilliant in the first 19 games of his regular-season NBA career, averaging over 23 points and six rebounds per game, before the coronavirus crisis forced the league to shut down. The 19-year-old Zion says he's been staying fit and will be ready to go when the league resumes. He's also giving back to the New Orleans community. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosWhen the NBA shut down in mid-March, he announced he would pay the salaries of all the workers at the Pelicans' home arena, the Smoothie King Center, for 30 days. \"I did it 'cause it's what my mom taught me,\" Williamson said. \"I feel like it was the least I could do and to just show the community that I'm with them.\"",

It comes after Novak Djokovic, the president of the ATP Player Council, called for players to contribute to a fund set up by the game's governing bodies.Tennis has been suspended until at least mid-July while the world fights the coronavirus crisis, meaning some players will struggle to make a living during the shutdown. However, Thiem questioned why he should ease the burden on such players ranked lower than himself and said his donations would be better placed elsewhere in society.  \"No tennis player is fighting to survive, even those who are much lower-ranked,\" he said in an interview with Austrian outlet Krone. \"None of them are going to starve.\"Read MoreREAD: Federer receives support after urging tennis to unify during the coronavirus crisisDominic Thiem says he would prefer to donate his money elsewhere.

I'd rather give money to people or organizations that really need it.\"Thiem, 26, is yet to win a grand slam but has reached three major finals -- most recently at this year's Australian Open.  The Austrian has earned nearly $24 million in career prize money, according to the ATP.\"None of us top players got anything handed to us, we all had to fight our way up. I don't have the guarantee in any job that I will do well and earn lots of money,\" he added.

        "content": "Sunshine Coast, Australia (CNN)For one minute on Saturday, millions of people in two countries were united by silence. Australians and New Zealanders paused at dawn on April 25 to commemorate the lives lost during war.  For the neighboring nations, Anzac Day is a day of remembrance to mark the first major military mission for the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps -- the Anzacs -- who faced fierce resistance from Ottoman fighters after landing on the Gallipoli peninsula, in Turkey, in 1915.It's a battlefield known for igniting the Anzac spirit, and a legacy of mateship, into the DNA of both countries.Mateship, an egalitarian concept, is characterized by ingenuity, honesty, humor, courage and compassion. It calls on communities to come together during hardship, adapt to challenging circumstances and provide a fair go for all.Doreen and Leith Ward pay their respects at dawn from their balcony on April 25, 2020 in Perth, Australia.For 15-year-old Australian Patrick Stibbard, mateship means looking out for one another. On Saturday, like millions of other Australians and New Zealanders, he stood on his driveway to pay his respects to the Anzacs. Read MoreTraditional dawn services were canceled this year due to the coronavirus lockdown. Instead, musicians were encouraged to play the bugle call, \"The Last Post,\" at home, while their neighbors lit candles and marked a minute of silence.It was the first time Stibbard had played the \"The Last Post,\" adding to the echo of trumpets, snare drums, bagpipes (and a couple of barking dogs) that broke the silence of the Sunshine Coast suburbia early Saturday. The inspiration behind the brass notes, his grandad who served in the Vietnam War, stood beaming with pride at the end of the driveway.Patrick Stibbard, 15, played \"The Last Post\" in his driveway on Saturday morning as Australians and New Zealanders marked Anzac Day at home.\"We can all live the way we do because he fought for us,\" Patrick said. \"It made me feel really special to have him standing there.\"For many Australians, the 60 seconds of silence felt all the more poignant this year. It was a tribute not only to those who served and sacrificed on battlefields abroad, but also the frontline heroes fighting Covid-19 right now at home. Consecutive crisesCoronavirus is not the only crisis Australia has confronted this year.For 240 days over the summer, the country burned.

The paradise of sunshine and sand was replaced by blood-red skies, choking smoke, and waves that tumbled soot. Australia's summer of bushfires was expected to define the beginning of a new decade. Yet, before flowers had time to sprout through the ashes, the nation was already grappling with a new crisis, the global coronavirus pandemic.  Firefighters passed the baton to health care workers, in what will be remembered as the year of the frontline worker.Australian artist Mick Ashley paid homage to the frontline heroes of 2020 in an artwork titled, \"The Road Ahead,\" that was widely shared on social media. \"Mateship in times of crisis is found in humanity. In Aussie terms, it's a call to arms,\" Ashley said. \"I created an image to thank the amazing efforts of frontline workers.\"Mick Ashley's depiction of frontline workers passing the baton from one crisis to another has become a defining image of Australia in 2020. 'Social Eskylation'From those in uniform to ordinary Aussies, mateship is \"understanding that even the smallest acts of kindness can make a huge difference,\" according to Erin Boutros, the co-founder of volunteer group Empty Esky.Formed during the fires, Empty Esky encourages Australians to support fire-affected towns by visiting them with empty eskies (otherwise known as coolers) and filling them up with with local products to support local businesses.JUST WATCHEDAustralia closes beaches amid coronavirusReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAustralia closes beaches amid coronavirus 01:53Travel is now banned under coronavirus rules, so the group is now encouraging Aussies to practice \"social eskylation\" by filling their \"virtual eskys\" with online purchases.\"We are extremely concerned about the businesses who have been double whammied,\" Boutros said. \"Summer foot traffic and Easter trade is what carries many of these businesses through the year. Engaging with regional small businesses makes a huge impact on morale and helps many business owners feel hope for the future again.\"Restaurateurs Susan Plath and Kevin Lamont were two days from reopening their fire impacted \"The Chicken Shop\" in the popular holiday town of Bright, Victoria, when non-essential businesses were forced to close to stop the spread of the coronavirus.\"Mateship saved our business from bankruptcy,\" Plath said. \"Without Empty Esky, we wouldn't have been able to pay our bills and put food on the table. It's that simple.\"Empty Esky challenged its followers to buy 100 bottles of the Plath family's Alpine Sauce. To date, they've bought over 7,000.\"It's not only the financial assistance that people all around our country helped us with. The supportive messages really did help us a lot from a mental health perspective,\" Plath said.You okay mate?The two consecutive crises has placed pressure on mental health.  \"It is okay if you are not feeling or doing well. It is normal to be upset by situations right now,\" said Professor Nicholas Procter, chair of Mental Health at the University of South Australia.\"While we try to work things out by ourselves and may think we are getting the help that we need -- sometimes we don't have all the bandwidth. A sense of community is a vital way of getting help, reassurance and connection. It means we are not on our own.\"Amid the coronavirus and in wake of the bushfires, Procter and his team partnered with the mental health charity R U OK? to revamp its mateship manual, a practical guide to supporting people who are doing it tough.\"The number one rule of mateship is to be a great listener -- giving the person space and time to feel safe and talk about what's troubling them,\" Procter said.For those wanting to practice mateship while in lockdown, his message was clear -- \"physical distancing does not mean social isolation.\" Our rural matesChecking in on our rural and regional mates is more crucial than ever right now, with the consecutive crises seemingly cutting the thread that many were only just hanging on to.\"Crises like the bushfires and Covid-19 put a further strain on communities that, although vibrant and rich in spirit, are often doing it tough,\" said Chloe Harpley, a 22-year-old law and art student from Wagga Wagga.\"The flames may be out, but the disaster is far from over.\"The Australian architects designing homes to withstand bushfiresHarpley founded \"Books for the Bush,\" which works to provide school supplies for students who were displaced and impacted by the fires. The initiative is now expanding to support kids studying at home under lockdown in remote areas.\"Mateship is all about putting yourself in the shoes of others, empathizing with them, and being there in solidarity. Knowing that complete strangers have you at the forefront of their minds is both life-changing and life-saving,\" Harpley said.The long haulMateship is Australia at its best. From claims of a lack of leadership during the fire to panic buying and fights over toilet paper, Australians' behavior at times has been far from perfect amid the consecutive crises. However, Empty Esky co-founder Erin Boutros said that in times of crisis it is essential to look for opportunities to make life a little better for people who are hurting.Koalas injured in Australia bushfires re-released into wild\"When we unite, and carry the problem together, it restores hope and gives us the motivation to keep going even when it's tough,\" she said.Procter said that while the fires are out and the number of Covid-19 cases is falling, there's a still long way to go before communities recover from what has so far been a tough year.\"Mateship is not just for today. If we keep supporting and being positive over the longer term, we can figure this out together,\" Procter said.",

        "content": "(CNN)A truck driver in Melbourne, Australia, faced court on Monday after killing four police officers in a crash last week that sparked an outpouring of grief and anger across the country.The driver, 47-year-old Mohinder Singh, was charged with four counts of culpable driving. Another man, Richard Pusey, has also been charged on multiple indictable offenses, including speeding, failure to render assistance, destruction of evidence and drug possession.Last Wednesday, Pusey, 41, was speeding down a Melbourne freeway in a Porsche at 140 kilometers per hour (about 87 miles per hour). He was then pulled over by two police officers on the emergency stopping lane, and failed a drug test. Two more officers arrived to help impound the Porsche, according to Victoria state police.Singh, who was driving a large refrigerated truck, switched from a traffic lane into the stopping lane, crashing into the police vehicle and the Porsche at 100 kph (about 62 mph). The four officers died on the scene and Singh suffered a \"medical episode,\" but Pusey was not injured, police said.Police and emergency services at the crash site on April 23 in Melbourne, Australia.At a hearing on Friday, Singh's lawyer Steven Pica said his client remained \"distressed and saddened at the tragic consequences of his acts.\"Read MorePolice detectives told the court that after the crash, Pusey retrieved two phones from the Porsche and filmed the scene, according to CNN affiliate Nine News.He then fled the scene and went home, only turning himself in the next day, police said. When he handed his phone over, it had been wiped.Police had initially suggested that Pusey shared photos of the scene on social media, but detectives at the Friday hearing said there was no evidence of this.The police's homicide squad and major collision units are now conducting an ongoing investigation. Singh is scheduled to appear in court on October 1, while Pusey remains in police custody and is set to appear in court in July.The deaths of the four officers -- Lynette Taylor, Glen Humphris, Kevin King and Josh Prestney -- sent shockwaves nationwide.

The Prime Minister's office ordered all flags at government buildings to be flown at half-mast on Thursday, with many independent organizations following suit.The entire city of Melbourne was bathed in blue on Wednesday in tribute to the officers and the police force. People tied blue ribbons and blue balloons outside their homes; blue lights were shone onto the sides of buildings and inside subway stations; LED screens outdoors showed a blue display with the four officers' names. Footage shot from a plane flying over Melbourne show the city glowing blue from all the lights.\"We stand side by side in our daily response to the Victorian community. And today we stand side by side as we reflect and grieve,\" said Ashton in a statement. \"The outpouring of community support to date has been truly remarkable and touching and on behalf of Victoria Police, I thank you for this.\"",

        "content": "Potsdam, Germany (CNN)Public life changed considerably for most Germans on Monday as the wearing of masks became mandatory in many public spaces across the country.In an interior design store on the main shopping street of Potsdam, just outside of Berlin, all the customers were sticking to the new regulations.Store manager Carolin Hucke said the masks made both her and her patrons feel calmer. \"I can tell that people are more at ease,\" Hucke said while wiping shopping baskets with disinfectant, and adding, \"they keep their distance and are more sensitive to the situation, but they are also less stressed and just watch out for each other.\"From last week, Germany loosened many of the restrictions on public life that were designed to halt the spread of coronavirus. Shops no larger than 800 square meters (8,600 sq. ft.) were allowed to reopen. So were car dealers and bicycle stores, regardless of their size.But there is a patchwork of rules and penalties across Germany on the use of masks. Fines for not ensuring that face coverings are worn range from \u20ac15 ($16) to \u20ac5,000, with rates differing across the country's 16 federal states. Some states are not imposing any fines.Read MoreMerkel warns Germany is on the 'thinnest ice' as Europe realizes social distancing is here to stayWhen Chancellor Angela Merkel's government announced the relaxing of the regulations, it only recommended wearing face coverings when going back into public spaces. ''It is recommended that masks be used in public transport and while shopping,'' Merkel said on April 15.As the restrictions were lifted, scores of people flocked into pedestrian zones in cities and towns around the country, eager for a slice of normalcy after weeks of near lockdown. And some states got creative in interpreting the rules, allowing even larger shopping centers to open as long as the single stores inside didn't exceed 800 square meters, or allowing larger stores to open the maximum permitted area while cordoning the rest off.This led Merkel to warn that Germany risked squandering the gains it had made in beating back Covid-19. She said she fully supported the measures to loosen restrictions, \"but their implementation worries me. Partially, they appear to be very bold, maybe too bold.\"Germany has a decentralized system, and the federal government cannot force states into lockdowns or make masks compulsory. But the states all separately made laws making masks a requirement, even though the details vary. In most states, people are required to cover their mouths and noses while taking public transport or when going into stores. A man walks down an empty street in Berlin.The type of masks themselves is not specified either. They can vary from surgical masks to even a scarf covering the mouth and nose. Germans call these \"Alltagsmasken\" or \"everyday masks.\"The theory behind mask use is that while they will do little to stop people from getting Covid-19, they will stop people from transmitting the virus, and the more people that wear them the more effective they will be, especially in places where social distancing rules may not always be 100% maintained.Just as the rules for wearing face coverings vary across Germany, so do the penalties for failing to put them on. The state of Berlin is the most lenient, it has no fines and will even allow people to board buses and subways without masks. Bavaria, meanwhile, the hardest region hit by the pandemic, is the strictest with fines of \u20ac150 and even up to \u20ac5,000 for store owners who don't ensure that their staff are wearing masks.Related coverageLive updates on the pandemicNew Zealand says it has \"eliminated\" the virusWill Germans use a Covid-19 tracking app?But with masks in short supply globally, the German government is scrambling to beef up its inventory, not just for medical professionals but also for general use. The world's largest cargo plane, the Antonov AN-225 -- chartered by the German military -- arrived a shipment of 10 million masks from China at Leipzig airport on Monday. Two further flights are expected to deliver another 15 million protective masks in the coming days. ''A sufficient number of protective masks are crucial for (the) further lifting of coronavirus restrictions,\" Germany's defense minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said, adding the masks would now be distributed to the country's 16 federal states who will then decide which facilities will get them.Germany's police union criticized the differing regulations across the country. \"It cannot be the police's job to explain the differences in the rules of the states,\" the head of the police union in the northern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern said.But throughout Monday, German media reported that people generally seemed to be accepting the measures. Hucke, the interior design store manager, also said things were going smoothly. \"I had one customer who simply forgot and immediately put a cloth in front of her face when she realized. I have not had any problems so far,\" she said.",

        "content": "Paris (CNN)While billionaires isolate themselves at luxurious hideaways on the Mediterranean during the coronavirus outbreak, residents in deprived and crowded areas of France are now facing a surge in deaths, along with unrest on the streets.Hostilities erupted this week in Paris' northern banlieues (or suburbs) following accusations of police brutality and racism during the coronavirus outbreak. Footage on social media appeared to show cars and trash cans set alight on roads, protesters hurling firecrackers and police racing to control the crowds.The lockdown in France has had very different consequences for different sections of society since it was announced on March 17. The country's ban on all non-essential business until May 11, along with a requirement for a permission slip to venture outside, has had the harshest impact on people living in poorer, more densely populated neighborhoods, according to an op-ed from several activist organizations and unions in Mediapart on Friday.The associations -- including ATTAC (Association for the Taxation of financial Transactions and Aid to Citizens) -- wrote that people in working class neighborhoods were on the front lines as essential workers. \"Yet social inequalities, already glaring, are reinforced by the management of the coronavirus and will explode with the economic and social crisis to come.\" In stark contrast, wealthy residents at one of the country's most exclusive gated communities on the French Riviera have been embroiled in controversy after it emerged that some had access to antibody testing, despite the strain on hospitals and nursing homes across the country. A French police officer with a 40-millimeter rubber defensive bullet launcher LBD (LBD40) walks in a street during clashes in Villeneuve-la-Garenne last Monday.Read MoreTensions flare in Parisian suburbsThe tensions in Paris's northern suburbs flared up after an incident last Saturday night, when a motorcyclist, who is of a minority ethnicity, in the Villeneuve-la-Garenne banlieue broke his leg after police opened a car door in his path. Police said in a press release that the incident was an accident that occurred as officers got out of the car to speak with the motorcyclist, claiming 50 people then targeted police with projectiles. The motorcyclist's lawyer, Stephane Gas, has asked for an investigation into the police's behavior by the General Inspectorate of National Police (IGPN), telling CNN that the police's characterization of the incident was \"all upside-down.\"He said the officers had opened the car door \"in the middle of the lane\" without warning before the collision. \"All I can do is ask questions,\" he said.In an area with a history of police brutality and anti-police riots -- as well as the separate gilets jaunes (yellow vest) showdowns with the government over inequality -- some believe the act was deliberate. Video of the injured motorcyclist being tended to by police went viral, sparking several nights of violence that spread from Villeneuve-la-Garenne across the suburbs of Gennevilliers, Nanterre, Aulnay-sous-Bois and Montreuil. On Tuesday, an elementary school in Gennevilliers was set on fire, police confirmed.French journalist and activist Taha Bouhafs, who posted videos of the first clashes with the police in Villeneuve-la-Garenne on social media, told CNN on Monday: \"Villeneuve-la-Garenne was a symbolic moment.\"People can see the double standards enacted during the confinement. All these images of people walking in the streets in Paris, unbothered by the police. All these images of police brutality in the suburbs.\"An elementary school was set on fire on Tuesday in Gennevilliers, in the northern suburbs of Paris, after tensions escalated.Bouhafs said the lockdown has taken a far harsher toll on working class families in the banlieues than on middle-class French households. \"Confinement is not experienced in the same way by everyone,\" he said. \"We don't all have terraces with neighbors playing the accordion. \"In the suburbs there are large families in low-rent housing with eight people or more ... These people are cashiers, delivery men, postmen, people who don't have the privilege of working from home.\"The coronavirus has also had an immediate and dramatic impact on deaths in these neighborhoods. The Seine-Saint-Denis area, which is next to Villeneuve-la-Garenne, saw an increase in mortality of 295% in the week of March 30 to April 5 compared with the number usually expected at this time of year, according to France's National Institute of Statistics. The Hauts-de-Seine, where Villeneuve-la-Garenne is located, saw a 255% rise. By comparison, the increase in deaths was 174% in Paris and 61% in France as a whole over the same period.There have now been more than 120,000 cases and more than 22,000 deaths in France.Interior Minister Castaner told the Senate on Wednesday that the authorities had coordinated operations every evening for the past few weeks in \"sensitive neighborhoods\" in Seine-Saint-Denis. He said there had been 220,000 checks and 38,000 fines in these areas -- \"about twice the national average in terms of police controls.\"Castaner said in the Senate that since Saturday there had been \"ambushes\" on police, which he condemned \"in the strongest possible terms.\" Earlier in April, he told Le Parisien newspaper that confinement rules were \"largely respected\" in the suburbs, adding: \"I've asked for controls to be applied with good judgment and restraint rather than for special treatment.\"France's Macron positioning himself as leader of the world \"Have no doubt: we are ensuring that containment is respected everywhere in France, and wherever our security forces are questioned and provoked. We owe them protection, we do so and we must punish this in the strongest possible way,\" he added to the Senate.The Open Society Justice Initiative was among 20 organizations that signed an open letter in March, before the clashes began, calling on Castaner and the Director General of the National Police, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Veaux , to ensure that police checks carried out during Covid-19 containment measures do not use excessive, violent, or discriminatory force.The initiative's research has shown a history of discriminatory police checks based on ethnic origin in France. Its 2009 study of Paris found that people perceived to be black were overall six times more likely than people perceived as white to be stopped by police and people perceived to be Arab were 7.6 times more likely than people seen as white to be stopped.Wealthy enclave embroiled in bitter rowCalls to support disadvantaged groups in the suburbs of Paris came as another coronavirus row unfolded on the other side of the country, in one of the most privileged enclaves of Saint-Tropez, the star-studded French Riviera playground of the rich and famous.A private clinic located in the exclusive enclave of Les Parcs Des St-Tropez has performed screening tests for coronavirus on the inhabitants, it was claimed last week in local newspaper Var-Matin. The St-Tropez mayor confirmed that 60 serology tests had been performed. Serological tests analyze a blood sample to see if the individual has developed antibodies against coronavirus.This came after French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on April 2 said there was concern over limited stocks of some drugs as coronavirus diagnostic testing in France hovered just above 20,000 a day. Diagnostic, or PCR, tests are different to the serological tests, however. Diagnostic tests show if you currently have the coronavirus, serological tests show if you have previously had it. CNN has contacted Les Parcs' association president, Jean-Louis Oger, but has not received a response.He told the Washington Post that the medical unit had only conducted blood tests for a clinical trial that his company is running to determine immunity levels in people who have had the virus and said it had not done any nasal tests to determine if someone is sick. He promised to offer immunity testing to St-Tropez residents after the stay-at-home order was lifted if the trial is successful.One local told the Post that people in St-Tropez were \"furious\" that residents of the high-end estate, where some mansions are worth tens of millions of dollars, had access to antibody tests while regional hospitals were struggling and work was still being done to expand testing in nursing homes.Meanwhile in Saint-Tropez, southeastern France, privileged residents sheltering at their luxury estate have been getting on-site antibody testing.Saint-Tropez Mayor Jean-Pierre Tuveri said in a press release that there was a medical center but reports of Covid-19 testing for rich residents were \"erroneous.\" He said the tests that did take place were free trial antibody tests for a laboratory, which would need to be authorized for marketing and public use through the non-profit foundation Institut Pasteur. Tuveri said there was \"no way, since this test has not yet been validated, it could have been offered to the nursing home's staff, to residents and even less to the population of Saint-Tropez.\"Aur\u00e9lie Perthuison, press officer for Institut Pasteur, told CNN it was \"not aware of the use of tests among the inhabitants of this city\" and was \" not involved and was mistakenly quoted in a press release.\"Perthuison said that no industrial serological test had been validated by the Ministry of Health. \"As such, it is impossible for a private laboratory to carry out live tests on a population,\" she said.She said that \"all seroprevalence studies must be conducted in a formal setting\" with oversight. \"At present, only one seroprevalence study has been finalized, and it was conducted in Cr\u00e9py-en-Valois, by our teams in conjunction with the French health authorities.\"A spokeswoman for the Regional Health Agency (ARS) for Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur said: \"The ARS is looking into the matter. We were not aware of this testing operation before the publication in the press.\"Whatever the case in St.-Tropez, the rising anger seen on the streets of Paris shows just how the pandemic is exacerbating inequalities, according to activists and health professionals including Abdelaali El Badaoui, nurse and founder of the Banlieues Sant\u00e9 association, who lives in the city's northern suburbs.\"As health professionals working in these areas, we foresaw that we would be hit particularly hard, given the multiple layers of social and health inequalities there,\" El Badaoui, whose association works against medical and social inequalities in underprivileged areas, told CNN.He said the organization had a plan in place for the health crisis in Seine-Saint-Denis as early as mid-March. It is distributing parcels of food and hygiene products as well as sharing videos it has made translating government and public health messages in 20 different languages. El Badaoui said people who had lost their jobs were \"really struggling\" and the organization had seen some who had not eaten for a week. \"People are not realizing it yet, but there is going to be a crisis like we've never seen before,\" he said.Others had stopped getting essential medical treatments because they were frightened to leave home or did not know how to contact health services. \"Not everyone is equal in front of this health crisis. And everyone should be,\" he said.\"Coronavirus did not create the social crisis, coronavirus simply showed the level of misery that some people are living in right now. I think people should take it as a lesson, and remember it in order to do better in the future.\"Coronavirus should be an opportunity to change the way we engage with people who face inequalities on a daily basis.\"Benjamin Berteau and Barbara Wojazer reported from Paris, Emma Reynolds wrote in London.",

Francesco Bonura, an influential boss in the Sicilian Cosa Nostra; Vincenzo Iannazzo, a member of the Ndrangheta; and Pasquale Zagaria, a member of the Casalesi clan, have now been moved to house arrest, according to Federico Cafiero De Raho, Italy's anti-mafia prosecutor.To prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus within correctional facilities, the Italian government authorized magistrates to transfer inmates who have 18 months or less in their sentences to house arrest.Cafiero De Raho said the three men had been held under \"extra isolation measures\" to avoid contact with people outside the prison because of the roles they had in mafia organizations. \"Once they are sent back home, these measures are obviously no longer enforced,\" the prosecutor added.Read MoreBonura was sentenced to 23 years in prison for charges linked to his role in a mafia organization and was serving only nine more months in prison. Iannazzo was sentenced in 2018 to more than 14 years in prison for charges of being an accomplice of a mafia syndicate. He is also known as a powerful clan leader in the city of Lamezia Terme.Zagaria was arrested in 2007 and sentenced to 20 years in prison as a member of a mafia organization. He was considered the financial mind behind the Casalesi clan.The release of mafia bosses was met with criticism in Italy. \"That is crazy,\" Matteo Salvini, the leader of Italian opposition party the Lega, said in a Facebook video. \"It's a lack of respect for people, magistrates, journalists, policemen and victims of the mafia.\"Justice Minister Alfonso Bonafede said the decision to release inmates is taken by magistrates in an \"autonomous and independent way\" but authorities are considering a proposal to involve the nation's anti-mafia department in the final decision.\"In this moment of crisis, mafia organizations can further infiltrate economic life, especially by supporting or even acquiring businesses in financial difficulties that aren't able to access public aid and are therefore obliged to turn to alternative credit sources, those of the criminal organizations,\" Cafiero De Raho, the prosecutor, told CNN.The total number of prisoners in Italy has dropped by 6,500 since February 29, according to the Justice Ministry.Alessio Scandurra, coordinator of Antigone, a prisoner's rights association, said the coronavirus regulations and other factors are behind the decrease in inmate population.CNN's Nicole Chavez contributed to this report.",

In a letter sent to the clubs, La Liga said it would not start testing players, coaches and medical staff for Covid-19 until the Spanish government approves a protocol to carry out such measures.The league made the decision to hold off testing professional players because \"the resumption of training sessions is going to be delayed.\"\"If we consider that we'll have the protocol in the coming days, maybe next week -- well, from April 28 until May 11, 12, 13, or 14 -- to start the training again, that's a lot of days for the players\" to wait after testing, La Liga President Javier Tebas said in a press conference on Friday.READ: Bundesliga ready to resume in May pending approval from German governmentRead MoreEibar SAD and Real Sociedad players lined up in an empty stadium on March 10 after fans were barred from attending the match due to the coronavirus pandemic.All football in Spain was postponed indefinitely following the introduction of Spain's state of emergency on March 14.Some Spanish media outlets had reported that La Liga had hoped to start testing players for Covid-19 as early as next week, as a first step to resuming training.But La Liga's announcement that it will delay testing comes hours after the Spanish Footballers Association (AFE) said it sent two more letters to the government \"again expressing the concern\" of first and second division team players about Covid-19 tests and a resumption of training.The association said players think those decisions should be made by the government, rather than the league, and it added the players \"consider there are other groups that need the tests more at this time, along with access to health care supplies.\"Jordi Figueras, a defender for Racing Santander in Spain's second division, told CNN the decision was the right one.Racing Santander issued a statement last Thursday stating their priority was to finish the 2020/21 season, but that tests should be available for the health workers on the front line before players.

But government officials said re-opening the country will be a gradual, step-by-step process, as they try to avoid a second wave of infections.Spanish Minister of Health Salvador Illa said at a nationally televised press conference Friday: \"I want to highlight the sense of responsibility of many sports professionals, who have indicated that PCR (tests for the virus) must be done under medical criteria and in the order that the health authorities have established.\"Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosSpain has the second-highest number of Covid-19 cases in the world, with 223,759 cases and 22,902 deaths by Sunday, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Just, you know, accomplishing things, getting things done, feeling like you're part of the winning or a part of the winning side of history and part of something bigger than yourself,\" the Cleveland Cavaliers forward told CNN's Poppy Harlow in an interview on her podcast \"Boss Files.\" That's why Love has spent a large part of his self-isolation giving back, whether it's donating to the team's arena workers who found themselves out of work or organizing meal deliveries to the Cleveland Clinic.  Of his $100,000 donation to help pay Quickens Loans Arena staffers who have been out of work since the suspension of the NBA season, Love told Harlow: \"I was just considering that anxiety of maybe not seeing your next paycheck. I know a number of them (the staffers) on a first name basis, and I just thought it was very important to just help alleviate some of that stress that they might have felt.\"And the NBA Champion said it's good for him as well: \"At least for me, a form of therapy or feeling better is just practicing acts of kindness.\" Read MoreFor Love, mental health is an under-discussed topic in American life and a problem that will be exacerbated by the pandemic.

The power forward often notes he's not an expert on the subject, but his personal battles give him a perspective to share that might help others dealing with similar issues. And for the five-time All-Star, the coronavirus pandemic is a chance to further the discussion on mental health, especially due to the instability it has caused everyone. \"It's going to be really important that we have the tools...because some of the language and models are broken in how we talk about this,\" he explained. To Love, the tools include things like access to therapy and mental health education. That includes, he says, helping communities often without those resources. \"It's not just about, you know, taking that curve and making sure that it's dropping off...but also in underserved areas, making sure that everybody is getting an equal shot. Everybody's getting a fair shot at staying healthy, living and reaching their potential.\" Love also pointed out the disparity of COVID-19 deaths in the African-American community, expressing his hopes the pandemic shines light on inequalities in access to medical attention: \"We have to come out of this changed.

He recently penned another piece in the Players Tribune, sharing how he is staying healthy both physically and mentally during self-isolation - whether it's watching old movies or exercising. And he's using social media, recently posting on Instagram a message to encourage his following to reach out to others to help combat loneliness. Looking into the camera, Love cited studies showing loneliness to have similar health effects as issues like obesity and cigarette smoking.

I was very stubborn and committed to doing things.\"Pichot is being modest.

Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featuresThese days, he lends his voice to the game's political side. Read MoreAfter rising to the role of World Rugby Vice-Chairman in 2016, Pichot is now hoping to succeed former England captain Bill Beaumont as Chairman. On Sunday, the World Rugby council will vote on whether it is Pichot or Beaumont, 23 years the Argentine's senior, who will lead the governing body going forward. Pichot celebrates victory over Ireland at the 2007 Rugby World Cup.Pichot saw rugby sevens make its Olympic bow in 2016, helped bring sevens tournaments to Vancouver and Singapore and increased rugby's residency rules from three to five years -- meaning countries can better retain top players living overseas.But he says frustration with the sport's current direction has compelled him to run for the top job.\"The game is in desperate need -- not of myself -- but of different mindsets,\" says Pichot.\"I've been part of World Rugby and at some stage I felt that that cadence of change or transformation was very blocked by some conservative way of thinking. The structure, the mindset of doing copy paste all over again.\"I said to Bill, 'I can't carry on for four more years, just sitting down flying in first class and going to royal boxes. \"'I don't do that.

The model was criticized by the International Rugby Players Council and some of the game's leading players, but Pichot maintains that the sport needs a system that creates a pathway for emerging nations.In doing so, he hopes to break up the small handful of countries that dominate the global game; the nine Rugby World Cups since 1987 have produced just four different winners. \"We need to build the regions like football has -- regional tournaments that can feed into the qualifiers for our World Cup,\" says Pichot.JUST WATCHEDPichot: 'Confusion' over new rugby leagueReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPichot: 'Confusion' over new rugby league 02:44\"Football has done it so well ... you have qualifiers in every region, which are very competitive.

CNN has contacted FRU chief John O'Connor for comment but has not received a response.Of the 51 members on the World Rugby council who will vote in this weekend's elections, 30 are split between 10 nations -- Argentina, Australia, England, France, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Scotland, South Africa and Wales.

As chairman of England's Rugby Football Union, Beaumont oversaw the 2015 Rugby World Cup -- at the time, a tournament which drew record-breaking attendances -- and succeeded Bernard Lapasset at World Rugby's helm in 2016.\"At this unprecedented challenging time, I am working hard with all stakeholders to guide rugby through the COVID-19 crisis and to shape and build the strongest future for the global game. My manifesto, with Bernard Laporte, outlines my vision of a game for all,\" said Beaumont.His manifesto pledges a review of the game's governance and a reform of the global season, as well as increased focus on the women's game, player welfare and World Rugby's financial policy. The latter has been brought into sharp focus by the coronavirus pandemic as unions struggle to achieve financial parity.Beaumont attends the rugby sevens at the 2018 Commonwealth Games. USA Rugby has applied for bankruptcy, with coach Gary Gold saying last week that he could soon be out a job, while Rugby Australia, whose embattled chief Raelene Castle stood down on Thursday following a call from former Wallabies captains for a change in how the game is administered, has cut players' pay under mounting financial pressure. Rugby Canada has also said that it will likely require financial assistance from World Rugby later this year. Yet Pichot is confident that the coronavirus -- which has seen rugby paused across the globe -- also presents an opportunity for the sport to reset.\"I think this virus has made us all think a little bit more comprehensively ... and be more in solidarity with the world,\" he says. \"We have to make a different strategy, a better strategy and integrate more equality, a better governance. I think it's time. I think crises are a great opportunity to do things differently. And rugby has been in a crisis. \"The problem is that just because it went well in some countries, we just kept on going.

Another more left-field pledge Pichot has made during his campaign is to help develop a new rugby video game. The sport has often lagged behind rivals when it comes to the virtual world -- football and NFL have established games in FIFA and Madden -- and Pichot says he has previously spoken to the CEO of EA Sports about rugby developing its own product to attract a younger audience.\"It's an industry that no one could have ever imagined,\" he adds. \"We need to work on it. Again, you need a good product. Kids want a good product and it's a lot of investment, I understand that.\"The outcome of Sunday's election will be announced on May 12, after which Pichot could be handed rugby's real-life controls. He's confident he can push the right buttons to move the game forward.",

        "content": "Rome (CNN)For months, Italy has had the most coronavirus-related deaths of any country in the world, and Cremona, a province in Italy's north, has been particularly hard hit. Beppe Severgnini, a veteran Italian journalist and author, lives in the provincial capital, Crema, where he says he has become accustomed to the sound of ambulance sirens, almost as if he lived in New York. Severgnini has traveled extensively in the US and lived there as a correspondent for the Italian daily Corriere della Sera. He spoke with CNN's Ben Wedeman in Rome via Skype about what he's seeing in both Crema and the United States, a country he says he loves dearly but now finds perplexing in the time of coronavirus.Q. In your book, \"La Bella Figura: An Insider's Guide to the Italian Mind,\" you wrote that \"Authority has been making Italians uneasy for centuries,\" yet now, with coronavirus, they are largely respecting authority, respecting the rules. Why is that?A. You can be ill at ease with authority, and respect them. That has been the case for centuries. Think of when we had the Spanish here, the Germans, during the last century. In Italian history, you respect the authorities because you never know, you have to be safe. But on the other hand you are ill at ease. The new thing is that we actually follow the rules. The problem with running Italy is that every single Italian wants to decide whether any rules, regulations, norms, whatever, is actually right for him or for her. Once they've decided, \"Yes, after all, it makes sense, fair enough,\" they follow the rules.This time the threat is kind of obvious. I'm talking to you from [the town of] Crema. Cremona is the single hardest-hit province in Italy. You hear the sound of ambulances every day, as we have for the last six weeks. Like New Yorkers now probably. You don't really need much to be convinced. And that's why, OK, I think it makes sense to stay at home.Beppe Severgnini in Milan, Italy, on May 17, 2015.Read MoreQ. Is concern for the older generation, for i nonni (the grandparents), behind this new-found respect for authority? A. Now it's certain the older generation, people just a few years older than me -- we're talking later 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s -- were hit for two reasons, probably. First because authorities, especially here in Lombardy, made a mistake not to protect care homes enough. Once it was in there, the virus was like slaughter. And because old people, like the nonni, actually live together with families and help with the children and the grandchildren in a way that only Spain, as far as I know, is similar. Now, with the schools, one of the problems when people are going back to work but the schools are not open, the grandparents cannot take care of the children, as they always have. My wife's 92-year-old aunt is a smoker, not a heavy smoker. She got coronavirus. She's in hospital. She's much better now. She's fighting with the nurses because she wants to take off the oxygen mask to have a smoke. She's better, she's getting out of hospital in a few days.In Crema, where I am, it's so sad. Every time I open the obituary pages of the local newspaper, I find so many people that I know have died. A whole generation is being wiped out. Q. The Civil Protection Agency is reporting that the situation with coronavirus is improving. Where you are, in Crema, do you see it improving? A. Yes. I walked from home to my office, I'm allowed to do that, and today there are five times as many people around, going shopping, going to the newsagent. A month ago you could feel the total emptiness and the fear. It's not that people are being careless. That's not the case. People can sense it's getting better, and the numbers say so. We have Cuban doctors and the [Italian] army in Crema, and they built a hospital and I went to see them several times. Everyone is telling me the intensive care [unit] there has been empty for some time and they are using these for rehabilitation. The only really important numbers, unfortunately, are the people who died. I think when we test everyone we are going to have a huge surprise. I think a huge number of people had it and didn't realize it, especially younger people.Italian soldiers gather at a military field hospital outside of the main Crema hospital on March 22. Q. You spent a lot of time in the US, as a visitor, as a resident. Do you find the US today, in the time of coronavirus, different from when you were there? A. I hate to bring politics into this but I think President Trump changed the mood and atmosphere and the perception [of the US] dramatically. When something like this happens it become obvious and clear to everyone that you need a wise and calm and steady hand when the sea is stormy. The sea is stormy and the captain is dancing on the deck, shouting at the wind.I have friends in Seattle, in Washington state. There they have their own plan, their own health provisions, and they're doing very well. They couldn't care less what they say in Washington. Sometimes its so hard to believe what's happening. You have the President ordering the lockdown and you have the same President encouraging protests against the lockdown he has ordered. It's like a Mel Brooks movie! It's not the America I know. Q. On May 4, Italy will start to reopen. Are you optimistic this can happen without too many problems? A. I think we'll open up. People will be careful. No one, no one thinks it's over, it's done. That would be a huge mistake. It will be very gradual. Some sectors, some industries will reopen. But schools and movies and theaters and concerts and mass, where people gather, that will not be seen until the autumn probably, if we're lucky. In Italian we say it's \"navigare a vista\" -- navigating by vision -- it's uncharted waters. I hope the Italian opposition, i.e. Matteo Salvini and the League [la Lega -- [the far-right party] will not try to take advantage of this to create chaos and discord. In Portugal that didn't happen. The chief of the opposition there said here we are the same country, how can we help?This interview has been edited for clarity.",

        "content": "Coventry, England (CNN)A nurse opens a hole in the oxygen hood to feed a patient with a straw. Thick bandage gloves cover the hands of a patient to stop them, bewildered and sedated, from tearing out uncomfortable tubes. A nurse says loudly to one Covid-19 sufferer on ventilation: \"Do you remember me?\" The focus and dedication is as overwhelming as the silence, broken only by the bleep of pagers and ventilators, calling the somber rhythm of the hospital's ICU.Weeks into Britain's pandemic, the agony of Covid-19 is still lethal and urgent in the General Critical Care unit of University Hospital Coventry (known as UHCW). During the 24 hours we spent in the hospital, two patients died and two recovered enough to leave the intensive care unit (ICU). But every day, more come in. And the fear of a second wave, once the lockdown ends, hangs over an exhausted, yet resilient staff.\"For the next six weeks, we're on standby,\" said ICU consultant Roger Townsend. \"For another one.\" Aoife Abbey, another consultant, agreed. \"I feel like one will come and I think we'll do what we've done before, which is our best, and hopefully we'll get through it.\"Since the pandemic began, about 170 people have died from Covid in the ICU at UHCW.UHCW is one of the largest hospitals in the Midlands, the worst-hit area of the UK after London. It offers two global warnings. First: Doctors fear that a second wave could be just weeks away, if the lockdown lifts and Britons again begin to move around and infect each other at higher rates. And the second? Just because a country's capital city is seeing the virus ebb, doesn't mean it is not still ravaging the regions. In UHCW, the ICU has more than a dozen patients and over 170 people have either tested positive for Covid or possibly been infected. Since the pandemic began, about 170 have died from Covid there. The pain of UHCW's exposure to Covid-19 hasn't brought the comfort of knowing it better. \"It's like nothing we've seen before,\" said Townsend. \"We don't really understand it. Most respiratory failure manifests itself in a text book way, but these patients? It doesn't manifest like that.\"Related storiesThe nurses risking it all on the frontline of Britain's outbreakLondon doctors speak of of 'continuous tsunami'Rural hospitals facing financial ruin during pandemicTrack the spread of the coronavirusRead MoreBut they understand too intimately the agonizing solitude the disease imposes on its victims. To prevent infection from spreading, patients must live their last hours without their family nearby, and only doctors and nurses with them as they die.\"I've held a telephone to the ear of a gentleman who was dying, so that his wife could speak to him,\" said Townsend. \"He was sedated, but we would always assume someone hears you. The nurses looking after the patient will sit and hold their hand as they pass away as well. So they're always with someone.\"Another consultant, Jonathan Paige, said: \"We're talking to people who are breaking down in tears on the other end of the phone.\" The unpredictable nature of the disease -- mostly hitting elderly men, but sometimes killing fit, young patients with no other health conditions -- is also harrowing, Paige said. \"Everyone's finding it quite hard especially when you see someone who's young fit, in the prime of life, get struck down and -- despite everything we can do for them -- losing their life.\"The nurses gather in hallways, removing protective gowns as a grueling 12-hour shift ends, showing nerves of steel. The moments when the relentless suffering, or discomforting heat of protective gear, gets too much, are gently referred to by staff as \"wobbles.\"Personal protective equipment (PPE) for the doctors and nurses working in the critical care unit at UHCW.They look out for and comfort each other. Amid a nationwide controversy about the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) for the UK's healthcare workers, nurses at UHC broadly said they have the protective gear they need, and seemed properly equipped. But that doesn't eradicate fear and despair at the end of a long, bleak night shift.\"There have been really difficult shifts where I've just cried in the shower\", said Nerissa Cifra Manalad. \"Cry in the shower, I cry at night, I'm going to cry again now,\" she said, welling up. \"I'm just scared and I'm just basically [wondering], 'When am I going to catch this?' Despite having all the PPE, you still don't know. If you go by the book, there are people still getting infected, so... I'm just so scared.\"Adding to Manalad's concerns are her elderly parents being alone at home in the Philippines, where she cannot travel to help, in the event they fall sick. \"I pray before coming to work. I pray before going to sleep. It's just not only for myself, I'm scared for my husband as well. It's just really scary...\"Dr. Roger Townsend dons PPE before entering the critical care unit.Fear at first caught Townsend -- fear of the unknown and of failure to combat the disease -- but now he says they focus on getting through and being ready for another wave. \"When my colleagues confessed that they were scared, I confessed -- I said, 'I'm scared, too.' Now this has gone on, I think the best we can do is wear the PPE, keep our fingers crossed that we don't get it. Yeah. So am I scared? No. Not scared like I was when I started.\"Back inside the ICU, the team continue \"proning\" patients -- turning them on their fronts to ease breathing. Townsend admits they still don't fully understand why the palliative technique works. \"It changes the distribution of air within the chest\", he said \"but also changes the way the blood is distributed.\"Sometimes, no level of care can alter the trajectory of a patient, and the team must make the difficult assessment as to whether they are only prolonging a patients' pain. Townsend said: \"If people pass away it's more often because we've come to the conclusion that they are not going to survive whatever we do, rather than them dying suddenly.\"The fear of a second wave is tempered by the hospital knowing how they braved the first. \"I think we all fear that potential second wave and possibly even further waves as we move into winter if we find this becomes a seasonal disease,\" said Andy Hardy, CEO of University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire. \"We have to keep the public onside, by being honest with [them], and the government giving clear direction as to why, for example, an extended lockdown might be necessary for certain types of vulnerable patients.\"Jacqueline Smith recovers on a ward for coronavirus patients at UHCW.But at the back of the hospital, the new normal is already visible. Patients come off a stream of ambulances into one of two channels: Covid-19 possible, if they have any breathing symptoms, or a separate channel if not.Inside is Brian Forster, who recently suffered from cancer and has been shielding himself at home as per government advice. But recently it became too hard for him to breathe, and he came in for a test. His first night in hospital was a struggle. \"Because with my breathing being so tight, it was hard to get comfortable,\" he said. \"So I've not had a lot of sleep.\" Movement had become a struggle. \"As soon as I get out of bed to go to the bathroom or do anything like that, I'm completely out of breath. I break out into a sweat and I just have to come back and have a sit down.\"In another ward lies Jacqueline Smith, a grandmother of five, who delayed coming into hospital when she fell ill, as she feared catching the virus she didn't know she already had. She half-laughs through a cough: \"They called the ambulance three times and I kept refusing to come in.\" The disease itself was deadly serious. \"Oh my goodness. It's so tight.\" She pushes down on her pyjamas and adds: \"You've got somebody sitting on your chest. And you're trying to breathe and you're not getting anywhere. It's really frightening.\"One peak behind them, and the lull before a possible second wave, is not a place for fear, said consultant Abbey. \"I am not sure that fearing it is helpful.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)He was supposed to be concentrating on the NBA playoffs. Instead, Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown has been confined inside his home for weeks on end, just like the rest of us. Brown, 23, is well ahead of his years, both on and off the court. Two seasons ago, he was instrumental in leading Boston to within one win of the NBA Finals and, in the process, pushing LeBron James to the limit.Now, he's telling folks from his home state of Georgia to stay home, despite Governor Brian Kemp announcing that certain businesses will reopen starting Friday.  \"As a Georgia native, I feel uneasy that I have family and I have friends there that will be the first to go back out into society,\" he told CNN's Christina Macfarlane.\"I don't want to see Georgia be... the guinea pig for what the economy is trying to do and start back up.\" Jaylen Brown of the Boston Celtics looks on during the second half of the game against the Houston Rockets at TD Garden on February 29 in Boston.Read MoreREAD: Why the world loves the Michael Jordan docuseries'Humble beginnings'Brown speaking out is nothing new. He is a vice president of the National Basketball Players Association's Executive Committee and has engaged in social justice discussions for years.  \"I just feel obligated,\" Brown said of using his platform to influence society. \"Coming from the community that I come from, even though I might have raised my social mobility by being an athlete and being able to have a certain level of economics, I come from humble beginnings.\"Most recently, he wrote an op-ed for Britain's Guardian newspaper, in which he argued that Covid-19 has exposed America's inequalities. While some players are practicing trick shots on social media, Brown is using his quarantine time differently.  \"I think systemically there are aspects of our health care that need to be addressed,\" Brown said. \"I think that there's been like elephants in the room in this country for a long period of time.\" He added: \"When I watch President Trump and I watch some of these government officials, it just causes more anxiety and more panic, because I don't feel like people are on the same page. I think that we should be united in our stance. It's not a political game.\"  Blunt statements like that from a young man, who's already achieved so much on a basketball level, be it money or stardom, reveal his desire for something more. Something bigger than just himself or the game of basketball.  Brown dunks against the Atlanta Hawks at TD Garden on January 3.READ: NBA's season of turmoil'People of color are suffering'Brown wants to make a difference. Not when he's 30. Not after he is retired. He hasn't got time to waste, especially because of the pandemic.  \"Our communities, our families, our neighborhoods are being affected,\" he said, adding that the NBA and players have to \"get into the community, benefit people and try to make it better because America is having a lack of medical resources right now. And I think people of color are suffering the most.\" As far as when he and the rest of the league will resume play? \"We want to just make sure that we're not doing that at the expense of anybody or anything else. I care about my society, my community, my people as a general. So I want to just keep seeing the NBA do the right thing.\" Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosWhenever it may be, Brown will again take to the court. His skills will be on display for Celtics fans to enjoy -- in person and on TV. The Georgia native could even lead Boston to a championship one day.  But right now, he is fully focused on the task at hand, and it's anything but fun and games.",

        "content": "London (CNN)The Duke and Duchess of Sussex dialed into a London court hearing on Friday ahead of Meghan's lawsuit against Associated Newspapers, according to a source close to the couple.Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, is taking action against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday for invasion of privacy and copyright infringement after the newspaper published excerpts of a handwritten letter from Meghan to her father, sent shortly after she and Prince Harry got married in May 2018.Earlier, a source told CNN that Meghan and Harry would listen to parts of the hearing, including the Duchess' legal team's presentation. The pre-trial hearing at London's high court is being held virtually due to coronavirus restrictions.  Harry, the Duke of Sussex, claimed that the letter, published in part by the Mail on Sunday, had been edited in order that it \"purposely misled\" readers -- a claim, denied by the paper, that he made in an open letter announcing legal action in October.Meghan is seeking damages for misuse of private information, copyright infringement, and breach of the Data Protection Act 2018. There is no trial date set yet. Read MoreAntony White QC, representing Associated Newspapers, argued at the hearing that Meghan's contention that her \"vulnerable\" father was \"harassed and humiliated,\" \"manipulated\" and \"exploited\" should not form part of her case. White said that the Duchess alleges the publisher was \"one of the 'tabloid' newspapers which had been deliberately seeking to dig or stir up issues between her and her father\" -- but that such \"complex tests of mental state\" of the publisher were \"irrelevant to the claim for misuse of private information,\" and should be struck out.In response, Meghan's lawyer, barrister David Sherborne, warned the court should not be quick to strike out matters, particularly relating to a claimant's distress.Throughout the hearing, he argued that the paper had deliberately stirred up a conflict and that newspaper articles about her father had \"aggravated the distress she suffered.\"The judge, Mr Justice Warby, reserved judgment and said that his aim would be to make a decision within a week. The Mail on Sunday and parent company Associated Newspapers has previously said it stands by the original story and has argued that there is \"huge and legitimate\" public interest in members of the royal family and their \"personal relationships.\"A spokesperson previously told CNN: \"The Mail on Sunday stands by the story it published and will be defending this case vigorously. Specifically, we categorically deny that the duchess's letter was edited in any way that changed its meaning.\"CNN's Anastasia Graham-Yooll contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Otmar Szafnauer, team principal of Racing Point F1 Team, has said last month's Australian Grand Prix could have gone ahead safely even though the coronavirus pandemic was sweeping across the world. Drivers, teams and fans had already arrived at the Melbourne track for preparations when the race, which was scheduled as the season opener of the 2020 F1 calendar, was canceled because of the pandemic. Speaking to CNN Sport's Amanda Davies, Szafnauer said: \"It was difficult to predict the future, but looking back, had we raced ... I think we would have raced safely.\"The risk was very, very low. We could have put the race on. The Australian government gave us the go-ahead to do so. However, there was a big unknown at the time and because of the unknown I think we made cautious decisions not to race.\"Australian Grand Prix canceled because of coronavirus outbreak, two other races postponedREAD: Coronavirus pandemic is 'final wake-up call' for F1Read MoreThe decision to cancel the event came on the eve of race weekend following McLaren's withdrawal after a team member tested positive for the virus.Szafnauer, revealing the majority of teams initially voted to race, added: \"The thing you have to remember is there are 10 independent teams, the FIA (motorsport's governing body), there's F1, and then there's the Australian government so there's 13 or so independent decision makers that unless you're all together you really don't know what the other is doing.\"In Europe, questions have been raised about the staging of Champions League matches in March between Atalanta and Valencia in Italy and between Liverpool and Atletico Madrid in the UK as well as the staging of the Cheltenham festival.According to latest figures from the John Hopkins University of Medicine, Australia has been hit by 6457 Covid-19 cases and 67 deaths. Szafnauer also said the Red Bull Ring, Austria's Formula One circuit, could host the first race of the season as Austria is one of the many European countries which has begun easing restrictions on daily life.Racing Point F1 CEO and team principal Otmar Szafnauer says he believes Formula One can fit in \"12-15\" races this season.The pandemic has caused the start of the season -- initially set to begin in March -- to be delayed, with the Canadian Grand Prix recently becoming the ninth race to be either postponed or canceled.The Austrian Grand Prix is set to take place on July 5. F1 rules stipulate that a minimum of eight races must be held for a season to be classified as a world championship.Szafnauer said: \"Austria as a country is starting to come out of their lockdowns slowly but surely, and that's in April.Coronavirus pandemic is 'final wake-up call' for Formula One, says McLaren boss\"So, if you can look forward and say that's happening in April, the barber shops and the beauty salons and the libraries are opening now and perhaps children go back to school in May, I can see a race without fans happening in July. \"And if that happens ... we can get 12-15 races in.\"The Racing Point CEO said that if that many races can take place this season, the impact of the pandemic on the sport should not be as dramatic as some, like McLaren team principal Andreas Seidl, have predicted. Last week Seidl said the pandemic was a \"final wake-up call\" for the sport, warning that teams could fold if changes were not made.\"I think our financial impact won't be that bad this year,\" Szafnauer added. \"It will still be significant, so we still have to save some cost; then, if we can have a full season next year, before we know it -- although this has taken a hit on us -- we'll be in better shape.\"Racing Point team principal Szafnauer says the Austrian Grand Prix in July could be the first race of the 2020 season.Szafnauer said the pandemic and its impact on F1 highlighted \"the fine margins that we're working to financially\" and compared what the sport is going through now to what happened after the 2008 global financial crisis. The cancellations and postponements have already hit teams hard, with most of their revenues coming from broadcasting deals, race hosting fees and sponsorship, according to a recent Reuters report. \"We saw people leave the sport,\" said Szafnauer of the impact of the 2008 crisis. \"We saw new teams coming in that didn't last very long, so we've got to make sure that if something like this happens every 10 years, the next one we're in better shape.\"Teams have already agreed to a $150 million budget cap for the 2021 season in an attempt to level the playing field, and last week discussed a possible further reduction without coming to an agreement. Szafnauer cautioned that while these financial precautions were positive they should not impact the intrinsic nature of F1.\"We're definitely [in better shape] through cost caps and maybe capping some of the expenditures, also maybe capping some of the development we do, especially the expensive development.\" he said. \"But not at the cost of the DNA of Formula One.\"",

Gorczynska, a human rights lawyer, was among a throng of protesters that used their vehicles to defy Poland's lockdown and block the main roundabout in the capital, honking their horns and shouting slogans against a citizen's bill to tighten what are already some of the most restrictive abortion laws anywhere in Europe.Some were holding black umbrellas -- a symbol of Poland's abortion rights movement -- while others had \"Women's Strike\" posters taped to their windows. Demonstrators dressed head-to-toe in black, and wearing face masks, circled on bicycles. Police shouted over megaphones, warning that assemblies were illegal during the pandemic and urging the women to go home.As governments across Europe continued to grapple with the worst health care crisis of the modern era, Polish lawmakers debated draft legislation last week that would ban abortion in the case of fetal abnormalities -- one of the few remaining circumstances in which the procedure is still allowed in the majority Catholic country.  Read MoreUltimately, Poland's lower house voted to send the bill to a parliamentary commission for more work. But the timing, which was slammed by human rights campaigners, presented a fresh challenge for women's rights activists who have been fending off an abortion ban for years: how to protest in the time of coronavirus.Women protest from their cars with umbrellas, a symbol of the abortion rights movement.\"We saw this as an attempt by the government to use the lockdown to push for this controversial law, because, as history shows, all these attempts of the government to amend the abortion law have always triggered a lot of demonstrations,\" Gorczynska said, referring to a nationwide \"Black Monday\" strike in 2016 that drew millions.\"If there was no lockdown, thousands of women would have been on the streets. So we were using other tools, especially online ones.\"Those who couldn't come out found other ways of demonstrating. Protesters rallied around hashtags like \"black protests\" and \"women's hell\" on social media, sharing photos of themselves in black and white or holding abortion pills in their palms. Others hung posters from their balconies or went out for their daily exercise with messages of resistance taped to their backs.Women in Poland are protesting against introducing strict #antiabortion law and proceeding over it during national #lockdown when demonstrations are forbidden and no real public debate can be held. \u270a #CzarnyProstest #StrajkKobiet #Piek\u0142oKobiet pic.twitter.com/YgXrjAwPh7\u2014 Marta G\u00f3rczy\u0144ska (@MarGorczynska) April 14, 2020\n\nBut the abortion bill is part of a wider problem, according to campaigners and academics who say that Poland's ruling nationalist Law and Justice party (PiS) is using the pandemic to continue chipping away at democracy and tightening its grip on power.\"What's happening now is the next stage in the destruction of our new democratic state,\" Anna Materska-Sosnowska, a political scientist at Warsaw University, told CNN. She pointed to 11th hour changes to how Poland votes and proposals to extend the length of presidential terms as worrying signs of what's ahead. The government is still planning to hold a presidential election on May 10, though a majority of Poles -- not to mention opposition politicians -- want to postpone it because of the outbreak.  On March 28, the PiS rammed a bill through the lower house that would allow the election to go ahead by postal ballot, even though the country's top court previously ruled that no changes can be made to the electoral code within six months of the vote. The bill has now moved to the senate for debate. CNN has made several attempts to reach out to the PiS and the government for comment.Materska-Sosnowska fears that changes to the electoral process would put the integrity of the vote at risk. While opposition candidates have had very limited opportunities to campaign, President Andrzej Duda, an ally of the PiS, has unfettered access to airtime and is ahead in the polls.Protesters wave flags and hold posters emblazoned with a red lightning bolt.The European Union's parliament said Friday that holding the elections in the middle of the outbreak could endanger lives and was \"totally incompatible with European values.\" The parliament also singled out Poland's ally Hungary -- which recently passed a law allowing Prime Minister Viktor Orban to rule by decree indefinitely -- for criticism. The EU triggered \"Article 7\" disciplinary measures against Poland after the PiS launched an assault on the independence of the country's judiciary, but the move has led nowhere.On Monday, opposition lawmakers began talks with politicians from the junior party in the PiS's ruling coalition about delaying the vote, hoping to capitalize on growing divisions in the alliance.  Draginja Nadazdin, the director of Amnesty International Poland, suggested that if the coronavirus was a test of whether governments are committed to human rights, then Poland was failing.\"If you want to use the coronavirus as a kind of test, to gauge how the government supports human rights, neither Poland's approach to abortion, neither its approach to free and fair elections, nor its approach to the right to health, are good signals,\" Nadazdin told CNN.Campaigners in Poland worry that women's access to health care is already being curtailed, with or without the latest bill.Poland is attempting to rush through an abortion ban & regressive #sexeducation law under the cover of #COVID19.We can't be on the street, so we've organised the world's first lockdown #ProtestAtHome.Post your pic. #NieSkladamyParasolek #StrajkKobiet https://t.co/Bt9gn6DCKe pic.twitter.com/vj8MsJM84X\u2014 Stefan Simanowitz (@StefSimanowitz) April 14, 2020\n\nJustyna Wydrzynska, an activist with Aborcyjny Dream Team, a charity that helps Polish women with access to abortions, says their hotline, which normally receives around 10 calls a day, started ringing off the hook after the government announced border closures to stop the spread of the virus.Many of the callers were concerned that they would no longer be able to obtain abortion pills, which are illegal in Poland, and others feared they would not be able to reach clinics abroad in time to have procedures. Abortions in Poland are only permitted in the case of some fetal abnormalities, rape, incest or a threat to the mother's health. And even in cases when an abortion is allowed, many Polish women still struggle to find hospitals that will perform the procedure.Wydrzynska was assisting one woman who had to cross the Polish border by foot into Germany, where she caught a train to Berlin and then flew to the UK. After the journey to London, she had an ultrasound and decided not to go through with the procedure.\"It's incredibly stressful,\" Wydrzynska said, adding that European countries who previously assisted with abortion procedures have told the charity they can no longer provide services to foreigners. \"What can we say to them ... we hope it's not the end of the story.\"Protesters against the bill practicing social distancing.And Poland isn't alone -- women's access to abortion has become one of many healthcare provisions thrown into jeopardy globally.In several US states, lawmakers have tried to introduce new restrictions on abortion, citing public health concerns. Some Republican governors, including Greg Abbott in Texas, have argued that abortion is a non-essential medical procedure and should be delayed during the pandemic to conserve personal protective equipment and other life-saving gear. Critics have accused these states of exploiting the coronavirus crisis to limit women's access to abortion, and the bans have ended up in the courts.When it comes to women's rights in Poland, protesters there say they'll continue to fight -- lockdown or not.\"It was even more important to show our strength, to show solidarity and to show that this lockdown doesn't mean that we have our hands tied,\" Gorczynska said.",

        "content": "(CNN)Newcastle United may be a four-time English champion with a rich history, but the football club, owned by a controversial British retail magnate who is widely reviled by the club's fans, has few achievements to cheer about of late.All that could be about to change, though whether for the better remains to be seen.The Public Investment Fund (PIF), which is chaired by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is part of a three-party consortium wanting to buy English Premier League side Newcastle United from businessman Mike Ashley, who runs Sports Direct.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and sportThe deal to buy Newcastle is being fronted by PCP Capital Partners, a venture capital and private equity company run by British businesswoman Amanda Staveley, alongside the PIF and private equity and real estate firm Reuben Brothers.Read More\"I can confirm Reuben Brothers is part of the consortium, but we have no further comment as the deal is not yet complete. On the reasons for PIF's involvement, that is for PIF rather than ourselves to comment upon,\" said a statement from a PR company representing the Reuben Brothers sent to CNN.Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is chairman of the Public Investment Fund attempting to buy a share in Newcastle United.PCP did not respond to CNN's request for comment, though financial documents relating to dealings between the company and Newcastle have been filed at Britain's Companies House.Newcastle United and the Premier League declined to comment on the takeover when contacted by CNN, while a request for comment from Sports Direct was unanswered.Human rights recordThe PIF, which has already poured billions into foreign investments in London, San Francisco and New York, has been criticized ahead of its latest potential acquisition. Under Premier League rules, prospective new owners of clubs need to pass the organization's fit and proper person's test.But human rights activists already have a conclusion.\"This has apparently been on the cards for some time so it's no surprise, but we still need to see it for what it is: Saudi Arabia attempting to use the glamor and prestige of Premier League football as a PR tool to distract from the country's abysmal human rights record,\" said Felix Jakens, Amnesty International UK's Head of Campaigns.\"There's a name for this -- it's called 'sportswashing.' With the world in crisis because of coronavirus, there's a risk that this deal could go ahead without the degree of scrutiny it should receive.\"Newcastle's Paraguayan midfielder Miguel Almiron  celebrates scoring against West Brom in the FA Cup. This week, Amnesty also wrote a letter to Premier League chief Richard Masters, saying the league \"risks becoming a patsy\" if it allows the deal to go through.Saudi Arabia has been widely criticized for its poor human rights record, which, according to Amnesty, includes torturing, sexually harassing and mistreating activists, claims the Saudi government rejects. In 2018, the CIA concluded that bin Salman had order the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which the Crown Prince also denies.Saudi Arabia has welcomed a number of global sporting events in recent years, such as the Spanish Super Cup hosted in Jeddah, the opening race of the Formula E championship and the heavyweight rematch between Anthony Joshua and Andy Ruiz.The PIF did not respond to CNN's request for comment. CNN has also asked for an official Saudi response but at the time of publication had not received a reply.Steve Bruce took charge of Newcastle last year.Calculated riskThe potential Newcastle takeover has drawn parallels with Manchester City, which has won a glut of silverware following investment from Abu Dhabi royal Sheikh Mansour -- although the club has been banned for the next two seasons from the Champions League for contravening financial fair play rules. Man City called those charges \"entirely false\" and is appealing the ruling.\"You invest in infrastructure and regeneration and that is politically a very sound decision because it gets you support from the political class of the city and it gives fans something to hold onto and also it makes you a lot of money probably at the same time,\" Nick McGeehan, director human rights group Fair Square, tells CNN Sport.\"It's worked in Manchester and I would be very surprised if that's not the model we're looking at with Newcastle.\" As for so-called \"sportswashing,\" McGeehan adds that it's often a calculated risk.\"As I understand it, it means the use of sport to present a positive image of a state in the hope that that will bolster the image of the state -- more liberal, more progressive, more tolerant than it is,\" he says.\"The misconception is that it will whitewash the abuses of the regime. It doesn't -- in many respects, it puts you under a spotlight.\"But it's a cost benefit ... lots of people don't care about human rights anyway and lots of people find it hard to engage with human rights abuses that seem so abstract and so far away.\"It's not like it's happening on people's doorsteps. So even people who are often inclined to care about these issues don't necessarily or can't engage with them when it seems so far away.\"Allan Saint-Maximin scores for Newcastle against Southampton.Rentier stateSimon Chadwick, professor of Eurasian Sport at Emlyon Business School based in Paris, is skeptical towards the positive PR generated by purchasing a football club.\"Personally, I am unconvinced by this view ... rather than diverting attention away from countries like Saudi Arabia, acquisitions actually draw attention to and amplify supposed failings and misdemeanours,\" Chadwick tells CNN Sport.\"Whilst characterizations (of 'sportswashing') are not without relevance, they need to be set in the context of wider issues.\"Saudi Arabia is a rentier state -- a country that seeks to generate revenue flows from overseas investments to help fund domestic economic policy.\"The flipside of the new ownership group is that it spells an end to Ashley's 13-year association with the club -- the CEO of sportswear giant Sports Direct who has been widely derided by fans for putting business interests before football.This includes not investing sufficiently in the squad, selling the club's best players and temporarily renaming the club's stadium to The Sports Direct Arena in 2011.A fan protests against Mike Ashley during Newcastle's game against  Man City last season.Newcastle, which would regularly finish in the top half of the Premier League prior to Ashley's ownership, suffered relegations in 2009 and 2016. The Magpies are currently 13th in the league with English football suspended amid the coronavirus.\"The reports of new ownership always spark debate of renewed ambition and intent,\" said one member of the London Magpies, a fan group for the team.The fan, who has protested against the Ashley ownership, tells CNN Sport: \"We're ready to take a chance on the proposed ownership being different and hopefully more in line with supporters hopes.\" But even he \"will not be buying shirts should they overtly or tacitly support or promote what I perceive as Saudi interests above that of my club.\"",

In the landmark decision, the court said that a physician may respond to a written request for euthanasia made before someone develops advanced dementia, provided certain legal requirements are met -- even if the patient's condition means they become unable to confirm that request.Euthanasia is legal in the Netherlands if the relevant criteria are met, which include a voluntary and well-considered request from the patient, \"unbearable suffering without any prospect of improvement,\" and the lack of a \"reasonable alternative,\" according to the Royal Dutch Medical Association. If those conditions are not met, the practice is still a punishable offense. Doctor acquitted of murder in landmark Netherlands euthanasia caseIn 2002, the Netherlands became the first country in the world to legalize euthanasia. Read MoreTuesday's ruling follows the criminal and disciplinary case against a nursing home doctor who in 2016 ended the life of a 74-year-old woman suffering from dementia. The woman had written a directive asking for euthanasia in the event she was admitted to a nursing home with dementia and she thought the time was right.Prosecutors had argued that the doctor did not do enough to confirm consent in ending the woman's life, saying that once she was admitted to the home, she gave \"mixed signals.\" At the time, the court concluded that the unidentified doctor, who has since retired, carried out euthanasia in accordance with the law and had not been negligent.In its judgment Tuesday, the Supreme Court sought \"to give direction to euthanasia lawmaking.\"\"A doctor may respond to a written request for granting euthanasia to people with advanced dementia. In such a situation, all legal requirements for euthanasia must be met, including the requirement that there is hopeless and unbearable suffering. The doctor is then not punishable,\" the Supreme Court said in a statement Tuesday.The ruling also noted that doctors can legally follow through with the procedure if the patient can no longer agree to it, due to their illness.\"Even if it is clear that the request is intended for the situation of advanced dementia, and that situation is reached so that the patient is no longer is able to form and express a will, there can be circumstances where no follow-up on the request is possible,\" it said. Ren\u00e9 H\u00e9man, president of the Royal Dutch Medical Association welcomed the ruling, but warned that the situation remained complicated for doctors. \"It is good that there is now a ruling from the Supreme Court. But even with more legal clarity, not all complicated dilemmas around euthanasia in the case of dementia are gone. With every request to end a life, a doctor must still make an individual assessment if euthanasia is appropriate and if all due care criteria are met,\" H\u00e9man said in a statement.\"Doctors act according to professional standards and also on their moral compass. The doctor's own consideration is and remains very important,\" he added.",

And this isn't helped by the unknown.Your heart is racing and you have a thousand questions running through your head. Where am I going to go? When am I going to be picked? Am I even going to get picked at all?I was told I would be a mid-round pick, but that doesn't stop those questions entering your brain.Rob Gronkowski agrees to come out of retirement to play in Tampa Bay with Tom BradyIt happens even to the guys tipped to be drafted in the first round.Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers was thought to be a potential first overall pick in the 2005 draft. But when the San Francisco 49ers selected Utah quarterback Alex Smith, Rodgers fell.Six prospects were in the green room for the event. The other five were selected within the first eight picks, leaving Rodgers alone.Teams passed and passed and passed, until Green Bay finally selected him 24th overall after four and a half hours of waiting.Rodgers later said: \"You start questioning everything, from where you worked out to how hard you worked to the people you surround yourself with to leaving college. It's very humbling.\"Draft in lockdownThe draft this year should have been in Las Vegas to celebrate the Raiders move from Oakland to Sin City.Owing to Covid 19, this obviously cannot happen.The select group of players who may be drafted in the first round might have earned an invite to the event. I understand if some feel they may have had their draft moment stolen from them by this virus.Over 600,000 fans attended the NFL Draft in Nashville, Tennessee last year but all public events have been called off this year due to the spread of coronavirus.The chance to proudly walk on stage wearing the hat of their new team, shake commissioner Roger Goodell's hand and drink in the ovation of the thousands of fans in attendance has been taken away.But every player enjoys the draft in a different way. Future hall of famer and 2007 first round draft pick Joe Thomas found out he'd been drafted by the Cleveland Browns while on a fishing trip.Others want a huge party with everyone they know and to be at the epicenter of the action.As somebody who experienced the draft in Tennessee last year as a journalist, and experienced the 2002 draft from the perspective of a player, I know which one I would rather go through, especially right now during a global crisis.It was extremely special to be with my family when I was drafted -- remembering the sacrifices they made for me made the moment all the more meaningful.Nothing is more special than to be surrounded by the closest members of your family, the ones who supported you and made their own sacrifices along the way to get you to this moment.My family sold our house and moved us closer to the city with bigger schools so that I had a chance to get into college and ultimately reach the NFL.To be sitting on the couch at home, surrounded by those you love, the ones who have helped you get to where are, is exactly where you want to be.",

        "content": "London (CNN)The British Parliament has seen many historic days over the centuries. Yet it will have experienced few stranger than the spectacle that took place on Wednesday afternoon. Spotty internet connections, up-the-nostril camera angles and garish drapes. Welcome to Prime Minister's Questions via zoom; the mother of parliaments reimagined as a regional managers' team meeting.For the first time ever, the UK's lawmakers were asked to grill their government via videoconference, as social distancing measures meant that the famous green benches -- usually packed with more than 600 Members of Parliament for the weekly session -- were nearly empty. In the spaces usually occupied by excitable MPs were signs showing where it was safe to sit. Above their heads were television screens, displaying the faces of those lawmakers asking questions from outside the chamber. The parliamentary press gallery, which wraps around the back of the famous Speaker's Chair, was home to only 16 journalists. Scottish Nationalist MP Ian Blackford joined PMQs by video link.When the time came for the first virtual question, there was visible concern in the chamber as Lindsay Hoyle, Speaker of the Commons, announced \"David Mundell, we've been unable to connect.\" Mercifully, this was the only major hiccup and the rest of the questions from those not in the chamber went relatively smoothly. Read MoreFor the rest of the session, viewers were treated to rare glimpses of their MPs living rooms, bedrooms, home studies and nostrils. Political obsessives on Twitter were transfixed by how some lawmakers opted to wear suits, despite working from home, their choices of home decor and what they deemed appropriate to have in the backdrop. Highlights included: Vintage footballs on top of a varnished table, a bedroom that looked very similar to a budget hotel and the jaunty angle at which Labour frontbencher Stephen Kinnock decided to stand in front of his iPad. Labour leader Keir Starmer makes his debut at the first ever virtual PMQs.Among those not physically present was the Prime Minister himself. Boris Johnson has been delegating to his deputy, Dominic Raab, who is recovering since being hospitalized by the virus.But everyone's eyes were on the occupant of the opposite seat -- Keir Starmer, the newly elected leader of the opposition Labour Party, whose first outing at PMQs was keenly awaited by political observers.Traditionally, any new leader's first appearance is met with a raucous cheers from their own benches and pantomime jeers from those opposite. But the relative quiet and emptiness of the Commons chamber was perhaps the most striking element of Wednesday's historic proceedings. The stillness of the famously combative chamber took the sting out of many of the barbs tossed across the dispatch box. The most tense exchanged, in which Starmer accused the government of being \"slow on lockdown, slow on testing, slow on protective equipment\" and Raab responded by accusing the Labour leader of thinking he \"knows better\" than the government's scientific advisers would under normal circumstances have had hundreds of lawmakers screaming their heads off and the Speaker calling for \"order!\"And while many will have welcomed a more dignified weekly meeting of the nation's legislative chamber, others will be concerned that it isn't doing the best job of holding the government to account. Indeed, the British Parliament's notorious hostility is thought by many inside it to be its most effective function.Dominic Raab standing in for Boris Johnson at the first ever virtual PMQsIt was already set to be a huge day in the nation's response to the coronavirus crisis. Parliament had been in recess since March 25, shortly after Johnson reluctantly put the nation into lockdown. In that time, Johnson himself has been hospitalized by the virus and his government's response to the crisis has been under fire.The charge sheet against the government is exhaustive, from failing to provide personal protective equipment to healthcare workers on the frontline to sluggish testing and serious underreporting of numbers. While all sides agreed that Wednesday's virtual PMQs was broadly a success, opposition lawmakers remain concerned that social distancing is making the job of scrutinizing the government harder than ever during a crisis. And however well one session of questions to a stand-in Prime Minister went, the British Parliament is still a long way from back to working as normal. And it remains utterly unclear as to when its most famous feature will return: the yelling.",

        "content": "(CNN)Many people are struggling with the threat of Covid-19. There's the fear of the virus, concerns about the economy and the financial impact of an extended lockdown and the loss of a supposedly normal life that we all used to take for granted.Professional football players are not immune. This week, FIFPRO -- the only global representative body for pro footballers -- published results of a new survey, which found that the percentage of players reporting symptoms of depression has doubled.Over the last three weeks, FIFPRO surveyed more than 1600 players in countries which had implemented drastic lockdown measures. It found that 22% of women and 13% of men reported symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of depression, while 18% of women and 16% of male players had symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of generalized anxiety.For mental performance consultant Dr. Tiffany Jones, the only surprise is that the numbers aren't higher. While athletes all over the world are twiddling their thumbs, she's been rushed off her feet trying to help them get through a period of relentless uncertainty.Read More\"The mental health aspect of this is becoming glaring,\" she told CNN. \"Athletes get a natural high from playing sports. It's the equivalent of shooting heroin for the first time, so not having the physiological and psychological elements of sport is creating mental health issues.\"READ: Even Olympic champions struggle to resist junk food binges during lockdownThe study found a sharp rise in players struggling with the lockdown. Dr. Tiffany Jones is having to get creative, setting up video calls with her clients, helping with virtual workouts and even racing them at jigsaw puzzles -- anything to try and mimic the rush. \"It's not the same, but I tell them that competing is a muscle. If it's not used then it will atrophy. I tell them that if they don't want to compete then that's a problem,\" she said.\"After racing through a 100-piece puzzle, they're like 'thank God, I missed that!'\" Reasons for the anxiety are mixed, but she's not surprised that women are struggling more than men. Female athletes have a shorter career span and there's obviously a financial concern too. Take, for example, some of the players the doctor works with on the Barcelona team.\"The men said they'd give 50% of their salary back and I thought 'good for them' and then I found out that the women had to do the same,\" she said.\"Well, 50% of $15,000 to $30K is not the same as 15 to 30 million!\"JUST WATCHEDMeet the 73-year-old 'Skipping Sikh'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMeet the 73-year-old 'Skipping Sikh' 01:54'I wanted to die'Dr. Jones is careful not to stray into stereotyping, but anecdotally -- in this regard -- she's found it to be true. \"I've had my athletes keep a journal and they write down their fears and insecurities. When I read the female ones, they're worried about others and what this means globally. Whereas my males are typically worried about their direct family members, their careers and what does this mean for them,\" she added.While many football players are only just coming to terms with the notion of self-isolation, those who have previously suffered from depression know exactly how punishing it can be. In the winter of 2017, the Swedish player Anton Olsson found himself all alone. The high of winning promotion to the third division quickly evaporated when the training stopped and some of his closest teammates left town.\"It was just me and my thoughts,\" he told CNN. \"I wanted to die.\" Olsson's problems stemmed from the fact that his identity in life was almost totally built around football. Without it and the structure it provided, he was lost.\"I have always seen myself as a footballer, but your self-esteem outside of football can be weak. When you're alone, you start doubting yourself as a person,\" he said.\"You just think you're really bad because you're not training. You think you're not so good at football, you're not so good at your work or you're not so good with your friends or you don't have the biggest apartment or the best relationships, every bad thought is getting true.\"READ: Taiwan plays ball -- and broadcasts live games to the worldJUST WATCHEDGolf 'lends itself more to social distancing,' says PGA Tour commissionerReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHGolf 'lends itself more to social distancing,' says PGA Tour commissioner 02:31'I felt that I wasn't loved'Olsson told CNN that he had identified the method by which he was planning to take his own life and he described a bleak period of 24 hours when his world crashed down around him.\"I didn't go out, I didn't care about anything -- any relation -- I didn't care about my dog. I didn't care about what I was eating. I didn't see a meaning with my life. I just felt that I was so bad at everything. \"I felt that I wasn't loved, I have no friends, I'm not good at football, and I'm not good at work. I just pushed myself down further and further, to a point where I was sitting on the floor, with a blanket over me, and I just cried. I didn't want to live.\"Olsson was able to find a way out of the darkness and he's eternally grateful to his Mom, Dad and brother for guiding him through. Having found the courage to now talk about it publicly, he wants to help other football players who might be in desperate need. He estimates that the problem is widespread.\"It's in every club at every level,\" he said.  \"Maybe two or three cases on every team.\"Yet still, the stigma remains. \"People are scared to talk about it, afraid that coach will say 'he's weak, he's not trustworthy, and we can't have him in the midfield today because it's going to be a hard battle on the pitch,'\" The key for Olsson and anybody like him is to start talking. \"When you're feeling really bad, you just want to have something smashing on your door, saying hello and going out for a coffee,\" he said.\"You can't smash the door now because of lockdown, but just call them and talk. And if you see that you need something more, then search for professional help.\"He says that you should think of your mind as if it was any other part of your body. 'If I have a knee injury, I will go to the best doctor I can find. Do the same with your head, with your feelings, with your emotions, with your mental problems.\"JUST WATCHEDCaeleb Dressel: How the next Michael Phelps trains in lockdownReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCaeleb Dressel: How the next Michael Phelps trains in lockdown 02:36Coaches at riskFIFPRO's findings are revealing and they should be a cause for concern, but there may be another group in sport who are even more vulnerable to the consequences of the virus -- coaches.Dr. Jones says that they are struggling, \"because they don't know how to support their teams and their athletes and if they don't have a strong coaching philosophy, they're being exposed.\" There is a technical aspect, too; up until just a few months ago, coaching happened on the field, face-to-face. Not anymore.\"Some don't know how to go virtual. I've been finding that it's the coaches and their staff who worry more,\" she added.There may, however, be some kind of a silver lining to the cloud of Covid-19. Olsson thinks that the demonstrable increase in cases of depression is a good thing. He told CNN that it would help football players realize that they are not alone, there are others who are suffering like them and that perhaps the stigma will be lessened.And if Dr. Jones wants to smile, all she has to do is look at her clients' social media feeds. \"The number of athletes who've got puppies during this time is remarkable. A puppy! That you're going to have for 10 to 15 years? They're like 'I've got to do something to give me life!' I mean, I guess whatever they need to cope.\"",

At the time of writing, the only event unaffected is the Ryder Cup which remains set to go ahead as planned from September 25-27 in Wisconsin.With guidelines instructing people to not congregate in groups to slow the spread of Covid-19 becoming commonplace, sport has looked some way from returning. But for golf, the spread-out nature of the sport means that returning on the week of June 8 to 14 -- which has been proposed -- is a realistic option for PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan. \"And for us to return with no spectators, our sport lends itself more so than any other sport to social distancing,\" Monahan told CNN Sport's Andy Scholes.

Monahan was named on that council -- something he calls an \"honor\" -- alongside LGPA commissioner Mike Whan. And during his brief time spent in the company of other leading individuals from different industries, Monahan says the \"collective power of an industry\" has been made evident to him. \"Whether it's testing protocols, social distancing, fans or no fans. Being able to get those insights from other leagues to share our own,\" he explained. \"At a time when the President has come out and said that he sees sports as a critical element to the reemergence and revitalization of our country is very powerful. Monahan speaks with Trump at the Liberty National Golf Club.\"There are very few instances, or certainly have been over the last several years, where we all come together and have that kind of conversation. I think in having that conversation you realize the important role that sport plays in our society, and that's incredibly inspiring.\"Trump is a keen golfer himself and has \"offered to provide a lot of help and resources\" to Monahan and the PGA Tour. \"He's been pretty clear in his comments that he sees sport as an important part of our revitalization and reemergence. \"He's made that clear publicly and he's made that clear to all of us and has offered to provide a lot of help and resources.\"READ: Donald Trump wants sports back, but some governors are less keen on the ideaTrump walks as he plays a round of golf on the Ailsa course at Trump Turnberry.Changing plansThe majority of the men's major golf calendar has been moved to the second half of the year because of the coronavirus outbreak.The PGA Championship and the US Open have been moved from May and June to August 6-9 and September 17-20 respectively, while The Masters will be staged from November 12-15.But the absence of golf is not something that just effects the players and fans. \"There are over 3,000 charities that benefit from PGA Tour golf over the course of the year.

It's pretty simple -- no-one wants to celebrate their birthday in the rain, and so, ever since the 1740s, monarchs have enjoyed a second birthday, with far more pomp, in the summer.How the British monarch got a second birthdayThe tradition is believed to have started with the party-loving King George II in 1748. That is the year that Britain's annual Trooping the Colour celebration was first associated with the sovereign's birthday. George's real birthday was in November, when British weather is often far from ideal.Soldiers fire a gun to mark the Queen's birthday last year. Trooping the Colour -- a military parade in London -- previously existed as a standalone event. It was officially and permanently re-purposed as a birthday celebration after George III became King in 1760. Edward VII, who succeeded Queen Victoria and ruled the United Kingdom through the first decade of the 20th century, is believed to have been the first monarch to receive the annual salute in person.What happens on each birthday?While the monarch's actual birthday is a comparatively \"no frills\" event, this is the royal family we're talking about.So the Queen would usually enjoy a traditional royal gun salute, and government buildings around the UK fly the Union Jack flag on the date.That tradition of flag-flying is extended to a number of royal occasions, including the birthdays of all senior royals -- but it had some pushback earlier this year when several local authorities refused to fly a flag honoring Prince Andrew.Trooping the Colour features thousands of soldiers and musicians.On the ceremonial birthday in June, the streets around Buckingham Palace are lined with tourists as 1,400 parading soldiers, 200 horses and 400 musicians take part in a extravagant ceremony.The Queen is greeted by a royal salute and carries out an inspection of the troops in their famous bearskin hats. A keen rider, she used to attend the event on horseback herself until the 1980s -- but these days, she arrives in a carriage.Members of the British royal family watch last year's Trooping the Colour ceremony -- marking the Queen's official birthday -- from the balcony of Buckingham Palace on June 8, 2019.After performances by a military band and a march by the foot guards, the Queen returns to the palace. There, she is joined by other royals on the balcony to watch a flypast of the Royal Air Force, and soldiers fire a 41-gun salute in nearby Green Park.What about this year?Given the coronavirus pandemic, most of those plans are on hold For the first time in 68 years, Queen Elizabeth II will not be marking her birthday with the traditional royal gun salute.Queen Elizabeth cancels birthday plans and traditional gun salutes due to the coronavirusThe Queen canceled the celebration because she felt it would be inappropriate during the pandemic, a royal source told CNN on Saturday.Instead, the palace is expected to celebrate the Queen's 94th birthday on social media. All family-related affairs, including phone and video calls with family members will remain private, according to the source.June's Trooping the Colour has also been canceled and there are no alternative plans to mark the Queen's official birthday, the royal source said.Earlier this month, the Queen addressed the nation in a rare televised speech, calling for unity amid the pandemic.CNN's Max Foster contributed to this article.",

        "content": "(CNN)A few days after he was shocked by 16-year-old chess sensation Alireza Firouzja, world champion Magnus Carlsen has enacted his revenge on the Iranian. The Norwegian was stunned last week in the final of Banter Blitz Cup by Firouzja, who won $14,000 as a result. But Carlsen, who has been world champion since 2013, reclaimed his spot on top with a 2.5-1.5 victory in Round 2 of the Magnus Carlsen Invitational. The tournament, hosted by the grandmaster and in which eight of the world's best players face off, is the world's richest online chess tournament, with a prize of $250,000. Carlsen beat Firouzja in the opener. But in a remarkable twist, the 16-year-old, who sat in a gaming chair wearing shorts, stole the second game, prompting the 29-year-old to describe his teenage opponent as \"very, very slippery.\"Read MoreREAD: Iranian chess referee left in diplomatic limbo over hijab photoCarlsen and Firouzja face off in the ninth round of the Tata Steel Chess Tournament in the Netherlands.The world No.1 won Game 3 comfortably and held out for a draw in the final game to move atop the leaderboard, while Firouzja has yet to pick up a point. \"It wasn't an easy ride, that's for sure. But what can I say? I'm happy to have made it in the end,\" Carlsen told chess24 afterwards. While Firouzja is yet to get off the mark in the tournament, his performances have enhanced his reputation. His ability to push an experienced veteran like Carlsen to the limit has tipped him to rival him in years to come. And although Russian super grandmaster Peter Svidler thought he was \"slightly overhyped\" beforehand, Firouzja's performances suggest he is destined for a career at the top. The title distinguishes players with over a 2700 F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des \u00c9checs (FIDE) rating on the scale that governs international chess competition\"The needle got shifted a little for me,\" Svidler said in commentary. \"I thought he (Firouzja) was slightly overhyped, but then I watch Magnus seemingly really struggle against Alireza, and you can't help wondering if it's not just Magnus having off day, it's because of who he is playing.\"I'm now thinking, yes, it's maybe in Magnus's head, and then it all gets a lot more interesting.\"Grandmaster Alexander Grischuk said: \"I think it's a bit like (Garry) Kasparov. He convinced himself that (Vladimir) Kramnik is going to be the next World Champion, and then when he played the match against him, he just totally could not play ... He can fight anyone but not destiny.\"READ: Caeleb Dressel: Even Olympic champions struggle to resist junk food binges during lockdownFirouzja (left) faces world champion Carlsen.Bursting onto the sceneFirouzja began turning heads from an early age, becoming the second-youngest player to reach the 2700 FIDE rating.He rose to fame when he came in second to Carlsen in the Moscow World Blitz in December.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosFirouzja plays under the flag of FIDE, the global chess organization, after leaving his native Iran to avoid government restrictions. Iran strongly discourages its citizens from competing against Israelis as a sign of protest against the country and a show of solidarity with the Palestinian people.The teenage grandmaster moved to France at the end of 2019 with his father so he could compete against Israeli opponents.",

        "content": "London (CNN)British Prime Minister Boris Johnson missed five emergency meetings in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, officials admitted on Sunday, as the UK government faced a barrage of criticism over its response to the spread of the disease.Government ministers were forced on the defensive after a wide-ranging critique in the Sunday Times of London revealed that the UK missed a string of missed opportunities to get on the front foot in late January and throughout February. Michael Gove, one of the senior Cabinet ministers leading the response to the pandemic, admitted that Johnson had not chaired five meetings of the UK government's Cobra committee  -- a cross-departmental group convened in situations of national emergency -- but that the thrust of the Sunday Times piece was \"off beam.\"The opposition Labour Party health spokesman Jon Ashworth said there were \"serious questions\" to answer about why the Prime Minister had missed the five Cobra meetings in February. \"The whole world could see how serious this was becoming and we know that serious mistakes were made,\" he said in comments posted on Twitter.Workers in the UK health service are still lacking adequate protective equipment, coronavirus testing is not at the levels needed and hospitals have been given the wrong type of ventilators, Ashworth said.Read MoreGove defended Johnson's efforts. \"The idea that the Prime Minister skipped meetings that were vital to our response to the coronavirus, I think is grotesque,\" Gove told Sophy Ridge on Sky News on Sunday. \"The truth is that there were meetings across government, some of which were chaired by the Health Secretary, some by other ministers, but the Prime Minister took all major decisions,\" said Gove.Read more:One third of NHS staff and key workers tested in the UK have coronavirusThe NHS nurses risking it all on the frontline of Britain's coronavirus outbreak'Like a bomb had gone off on either side of their chest.' London doctors speak of 'continuous tsunami'\"Nobody can say that the Prime Minister wasn't throwing heart and soul into fighting this virus. His leadership has been clear. He's been inspirational at times.\"Speaking later on the BBC's The Andrew Marr Show, Gove acknowledged that Johnson had not attended the five Cobra meetings but said this was not unusual since such meetings were usually led by the relevant Secretary of State. Johnson first chaired a Cobra meeting on coronavirus on March 2.Gove added that the Sunday Times article was using this information \"out of context\" and \"whipped [it] up in order to create a 'j'accuse' narrative.\"The government is under pressure over its response to the coronavirus outbreak and faces growing calls for it to spell out a plan for bringing the country out of lockdown. The number of UK deaths in hospital of people who tested positive for coronavirus had reached 16,060 as of 5 p.m. Saturday, the Department of Health and Social Care said.Shortages of clinical gowns The Sunday Times report stated that a number of opportunities to reduce the impact of the pandemic had been missed by the UK government in January, February and March.Boris Johnson is getting better, but the nation he leads is notThe government has been criticized over shortages of personal protective equipment for frontline health and social care workers and a slow start to testing for the virus.Stocks of clinical gowns to protect health workers from coronavirus in the UK are \"drawn down,\" Gove told the BBC's Andrew Marr, but he defended the government's response. \"We had stocks, we built them up for a flu pandemic, they were augmented by the stocks we had for a No Deal Brexit. But it is the case (...) that those stocks are drawn down,\" he said.Gove added that \"new PPE [personal protective equipment] is coming in this weekend from Turkey\" on top of 25 million gowns from China \"secured\" by the British Ambassador in Beijing.Pregnant nurse dies of Covid-19 but baby survives after emergency C-sectionResponding to UK media reports Sunday that a large scale PPE shipment from Turkey to the UK had been delayed, a spokesperson at the Department of Health and Social Care told CNN: \"We are continuing to work to ensure the shipment is delivered as soon as possible.\"  The UK government has a Royal Air Force plane on standby to take off as soon as the shipment is ready.Shipments of PPE from Turkey require special export permits from the Health Ministry after the country banned exports of such items. On Saturday, the UK's local government Secretary of State Robert Jenrick said \"a very large consignment of PPE was due to arrive\" the next day from Turkey. He said it \"amounts to 84 tons of PPE\" and includes 400,000 clinical gowns.Speaking to Sky's Sophy Ridge, Gove said the shipment from Turkey included \"tens of thousands of gowns.\"On Friday, NHS Providers -- an organization that represents NHS hospitals -- warned that there was a \"critical\" shortage of clinical gowns in the UK. According to the organization, some hospitals will \"run out of fully fluid repellent gowns this weekend\" and will be forced to use the \"highest possible level of alternative\" protective equipment.A Downing Street spokesperson said in a statement Sunday that the government had been \"working day and night to battle against coronavirus, delivering a strategy designed at all times to protect our NHS and save lives,\" and guided by medical and scientific expertise.\"Our response has ensured that the NHS has been given all the support it needs to ensure everyone requiring treatment has received it, as well as providing protection to businesses and reassurance to workers,\" the statement said.\"The Prime Minister has been at the helm of the response to this, providing leadership during this hugely challenging period for the whole nation.\" Photos: The coronavirus pandemicWorkers at the Inhauma cemetery in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, carry the coffin containing the remains of 89-year-old Irodina Pinto Ribeiro on Friday, June 18, 2021.

        "content": "(CNN)Olympic champions are not so different to you and I.Caeleb Dressel, the man often described as 'the new Michael Phelps,' has been faced with many of the same problems as the rest of us during lockdown. Namely, avoiding boredom and resisting junk food binges.Tipped to win multiple golds at the Tokyo Games, which were initially scheduled for this summer before the coronavirus pandemic put the world on hold, Dressel is learning to adapt -- adjusting to life without regular visits to the swimming pool and trying to cope without physically seeing the family and friends he misses so much. He has also had to put plans for world domination on hold, too. Katie Ledecky hoping next year's Olympics can be a celebration of 'the entire world coming together'The 23-year-old won seven golds at the 2017 World Championships and six in 2019 and has broken Phelps' 100 meter butterfly world record. This summer he may have matched Phelps' record of eight golds at a single Games, but the American is sanguine about his career being at a standstill.Read More\"I certainly don't want a pity party or anything like that,\" Dressel told CNN Sport. \"I still have my sponsors, so the worst thing happens to me is I don't get to swim in the Olympics for a year. You know, that's not the end of the world for me.\"People are getting sick or dying, so that's why I'm okay with [it]. I don't get to swim in a pool -- I'm fine with that getting pushed back because there are a lot of things that are bigger than swimming. This is life or death. So what I don't get to swim for a year. That's exactly what the mindset needs to be.\"Caeleb Dressel celebrates after winning the 100m butterfly final \nat the 2019 World Championships.Life in lockdownTo combat the tedium of life in lockdown, the two-time Olympic gold medalist has joined in the online craze of performing trick shots while in quarantine, with the help of an assistant, his pet dog Jane.         View this post on Instagram           These all took one try @bayleyymain @benfken yes the tape came off of Jane easy A post shared by  Caeleb Dressel (@caelebdressel) on Mar 22, 2020 at 9:07am PDT \"This was day four in the quarantine, so I'm still trying to figure it out,\" he explained. \"I've seen a couple of trick shot videos going around, I'll try some of these out. I did some pretty cool ones, but ... the cup taped to her head -- yeah, that was the biggest one. \"That was actually the hardest one as well because she kept moving and stuff. It's been fun making videos, trying to interact. I just miss seeing people. I'm not like a social butterfly or anything, but I just miss seeing even my friends. I mean, everybody does. I miss seeing my parents.\"But social media has been helping a lot. My YouTube channel I've done more than I ever have on it. Instagram, going live and just trying to connect with people the most I can because if I'm feeling lonely, I feel like a lot of people are and it's just kind of looking for anything to feel connected with. So I'm trying to help out with that.\"To compare Dressel's physique to that of a Greek God would perhaps be enough to make even Zeus himself blush.However, with training time in the pool limited due to the lockdown -- he can now \"only\" swim four times a week and weight train -- the swimming star has become more conscious about his diet.And that can be particularly challenging for somebody with a sweet tooth. Dressel has previously admitted his dream cheat meal would be to finish an entire family pack of Oreos and one of his housemates, Ben Kennedy, is renowned for baking brownies.\"He's so good at baking it's insane,\" Dressel said. \"He's got a little apron and everything. He just bakes all the time.Caeleb Dressel won seven gold medals at the 2017 World Championships.\"Sometimes, if he wants me to have a cookie, I'll have a cookie, but just to be able to compliment him and let him know that his cooking was good. But right now, more than ever, I want to try to hone-in on cleaning up my diet. \"It's not like I was eating like trash earlier, but it's easier now that I'm not fitting in 10 practices a week. When I got out of the water in my old routine, I'm just looking for any food in sight to just stuff in my body -- just very, very hungry. So right now, it's a lot easier to kind of go through and pick out the right meals ahead of time.\"Dressel is fortunate to live within a five minute walk from the home of his strength and conditioning coach, Matt DeLancey, and have access to his garage gym.It might not quite match the training facilities he's used to, but Dressel -- with his philosophical outlook on life -- is choosing to focus on the small wins.\"I get to work out shirtless,\" he said. \"I hate wearing shirts. I mean, most of the time I'm just in a Speedo, so I get to lift without a shirt on now. So there are actually some better things with lifting when you think about it.\"'Staying hungry'Despite his Olympic plans being derailed by this unprecedented situation, Dressel is determined to make the most of the challenges put it in front of him.JUST WATCHEDLedecky on postponing Olympics: Certainly the right callReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLedecky on postponing Olympics: Certainly the right call 00:55On the swimming front, his coach has tapered his training plan to avoid burnout with almost 18 months still go to until the rescheduled games, while out of the pool he's dedicating some of his extra time to reading more.He also has a wedding to plan, although he admitted much of the organization is being expertly handled by fiancee, Meghan Haila, who Dressel proposed to at the end of last year.\"Am I going to let this absolutely just ruin all the momentum I had or am I going to carry that over to 2021?\" he said. \"I plan on carrying it over and just staying hungry, still finding ways to challenge myself, still waking up early, I don't want to sleep in.  \"I want to have everything in place where I come out of this better and ahead of where I was before this happened. It's not good, it's not bad, it's just different and what are you going to do during this time to turn into something better? I mean, that applies to everybody. \"That doesn't just apply to me, it doesn't apply to swimmers, it doesn't apply to just athletes. If you're out of a job right now there are things you can do. There are things you can work on, things that you should have been working on that maybe you're too busy to do that you can start knocking out during this time. \"Whatever lies in front, we'll get used to it and we'll adapt and figure out a plan.\"",

        "content": "London (CNN)Prince Harry pleaded with his soon-to-be father-in-law Thomas Markle to stop speaking to the press shortly before he and Meghan married in 2018, according to documents filed in the UK high court.The documents filed on behalf of the Duchess of Sussex show that Prince Harry made the comments in a series of text messages to Thomas Markle on May 14, 2018 -- not long after Markle confirmed he wouldn't be attending the wedding in Windsor on May 19.Harry also told him the couple weren't angry at him for pulling out of attending their wedding, the documents show.In a series of messages sent on May 14, 2018 Prince Harry said: \"Tom, Harry again! Really need to speak to u. U do not need to apologize, we understand the circumstances but 'going public' will only make the situation worse. \"If u love Meg and want to make it right please call me as there are two other options which don't involve u having to speak to the media, who incidentally created this whole situation. So please call me so I can explain. Meg and I are not angry, we just need to speak to u. Thanks,\" he wrote.Read MoreThe details of the text messages have been released as part of legal action the Duchess of Sussex is taking against Associated Newspapers, the publisher of the Mail on Sunday, for invasion of privacy and copyright infringement after the newspaper published excerpts of a handwritten letter from Meghan to her father, sent shortly after she and Prince Harry got married.Meghan and Harry tell four British tabloids they can expect 'zero engagement'According to that publication, Meghan had complained to her father that he had ignored many of her attempts to make contact, telling him his actions had \"broken my heart into a million pieces.\"The original article in the Mail on Sunday also included claims from Thomas Markle that he had reached out \"multiple times\" in an attempt to patch things up.Lawyers acting on behalf of the Duchess say the texts have been included to set out the \"full exchanges\" in messages between Meghan and her father in the lead up to the wedding, rather than relying on the defendant's \"highly partial summary of them.\"The reply brief also details the text messages Prince Harry sent Thomas Markle.In another message, Harry wrote: \"Oh any speaking to the press WILL backfire, trust me Tom. Only we can help u, as we have been trying from day 1.\"Rather than reply to Prince Harry, the court documents allege that Thomas Markle issued a statement through celebrity news website TMZ announcing he had gone to hospital after suffering a heart attack.A day later, on May 15, 2018, Meghan texted her father to say: \"I've been reaching out to you all weekend but you're not taking any of our calls or replying to any texts ... Very concerned about your health and safety and have taken every measure to protect you but not sure what more we can do if you don't respond ... Do you need help? Can we send the security team down again? I'm very sorry to hear you're in the hospital but need you to please get in touch with us ... What hospital are you at?\"According to the documents, she texted again 10 minutes later to say that she and Prince Harry had dispatched a security team to look after him, but it was refused. Meghan's father, Thomas Markle.In the reply brief filed in court, lawyers for the Duchess of Sussex say Meghan's phone received a missed call at 4:57 a.m. on May 19, 2018 (the morning of her wedding) but did not receive any text messages or further missed calls from Thomas Markle at any point afterwards.Harry and Meghan married later that day in Windsor, England.The Mail on Sunday and parent company Associated Newspapers has previously said it stands by the original story it published and will defend the case vigorously.The company will argue that there was \"huge and legitimate\" public interest in members of the royal family and their \"personal relationships.\"In her reply brief, the Duchess of Sussex states that any claims of freedom of expression by the defendant to publish the contents of the letter are outweighed by her expectation of privacy.A hearing in relation to the case is due to take place this Friday.This story has been updated to correct what the Sussexes' reply brief says about freedom of expression and the expectation of privacy.",

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) confirmed the Games would be pushed back until 2021 because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.It is the first time in history that the Olympics have been postponed during peacetime, with the Games in 1916, 1940 and 1944 canceled because of world wars.\"To be honest with you, I don't think the Olympics is likely be held next year, if held anytime,\" said the professor of infectious diseases at Kobe University.Read More\"Japan might be able to control this disease by next summer, and I wish we could, but I don't think that would happen everywhere on Earth, so in this regard I'm very pessimistic about holding the Olympics Games in next summer.\"READ: Meet the 73-year-old 'skipping Sikh' raising money to fight the coronavirus crisisThe Olympic Games were delayed until 2021.

What we are visualizing is a home that can alternate between an office space and a gym. The good news is that I'm not alone. Realizing -- and more importantly, empathizing with -- the situation, gyms and fitness experts have used their available platforms to share workouts which people can do from home for free. Ross Valley Crossfit coach Nikolas Moro watches class attendees as he leads a virtual fitness class.Barry's Bootcamp and Psycle in the UK and Modo Yoga LA in the US are such examples, all hosting Instagram Live workouts.A video of a fitness instructor commanding a workout session from a rooftop in Seville, Spain really stuck with me -- with people following instructions from their balconies.Even CNN's own Chris Cuomo, a self-confessed fitness enthusiast, has shared his own tips on how to work out from home. Cuomo has since then contracted the virus, but has remained upbeat, posting on social media how others can remain positive and healthy. I for one go out for a daily run -- within government protocols -- with as much precaution as I can. I choose a specific trail with almost no one around and if anyone is in sight, I will keep my distance.The rest of my workout is at home, with resistance bands and a mat for my stretches, pushups and crunches. With no live sporting events to watch, I've turned to YouTube for match highlights, top 10 plays (in the NBA), Michael Jordan career moments and other sport related content. Just now, I spent five minutes just looking at a five-minute Kobe Bryant highlight reel showcasing his \"Mamba Mentality\" winning shot moments. I'm not the only one craving a sporting fix.Just ask NBA stars Spencer Dinwiddie of the Brooklyn Nets, Steph Curry of the Golden State Warriors or Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics (to name but a few), who have gone as far to watching their own highlights!Other adjustments are having to be made. We've switched from normal human interactions to remote ones, putting more emphasis on video group chats, often comprised of four or more people connected from different parts of the world.We no longer go out for dinner, instead turning to Deliveroo and Uber Eats to bring some of our favorite treats to our home. Many have taken measures to accommodate clients during quarantine, by waiving their delivery fee or offering the option for the driver to leave the food literally on your doorstep to accommodate social distancing. We also have changed how we get our groceries, with many now turning to online shopping to get their food, medicine and other essential goods -- if you're able to book a slot.READ: This year's Wimbledon could be canceled with decision to be made next weekEvandro Guerra, player of the national Brazilian volleyball squad,  trains in his home with his wife.Family Of course these sacrifices become trivial when looking at the bigger picture.

View this post on Instagram           Nessun Dorma on the balcony #flashmobsonoro #firenze #iorestoacasa #nessundorma #florence #italy #mauriziomarchinitenore #mauriziomarchini A post shared by  Maurizio Marchini (@marchini.maurizio) on Mar 18, 2020 at 2:10pm PDT Other community members have also stepped in, volunteering to go out and pick up food and medicine for the elderly, organizing movements to pay tribute to health workers or sing -- even if off key -- to lift people's spirits.Likewise, many athletes and clubs have come together to either help their communities or support medical research.Basketball players such as reigning NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo (Milwaukee Bucks), rookie sensation Zion Williamson (New Orleans Pelicans) and former NBA champion Kevin Love (Cleveland Cavaliers) are just a few of those names. Football superstars Sadio Mane of Liverpool and AC Milan's Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 are just a small sample of the footballing community who have contributed to help the cause, while women tennis icons Li Na and Simona Halep and NFL player JJ Watt are also doing their bit.

        "content": "(CNN)Earlier this month, there was a funeral procession in the Sicilian town of Messina, in defiance of a nationwide lockdown in Italy. It was no ordinary procession. The couple of dozen people walking behind the hearse were paying their respects to a 70-year-old scion of one of the most notorious Mafia famiglie.Claudio Fava, president of the regional anti-Mafia committee, described it as a \"real scandal, an insult to those who lost their relatives in the pandemic.\" Funerals have been banned in Italy since early March as part of a broader set of restrictions aimed at curbing the Covid-19 outbreak that has killed nearly 23,000 people as of Friday.JUST WATCHEDPeople unable to say goodbye to loved ones amid coronavirusReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPeople unable to say goodbye to loved ones amid coronavirus 02:03That the procession took place at all speaks to the power -- and the impunity -- wielded by the Mafia in parts of Italy.Read MoreSenior anti-mafia officials and researchers have told CNN that Mafia clans are already taking advantage of the coronavirus pandemic, especially in southern Italy. They are providing everyday necessities in poor neighborhoods, offering credit to businesses on the verge of bankruptcy and planning to siphon off a chunk of the billions of euros being lined up in stimulus funds.The most powerful branch of the Mafia -- the 'Ndrangheta, based in Calabria -- is thought to control 80% of the European cocaine market. Even as the pandemic made distribution more difficult, it took advantage of the lockdown.Journalist Roberto Saviano -- author of \"Gomorrah: Italy's other Mafia,\" an expose of the Camorra mafia in Naples  -- told CNN that \"the traffickers took advantage of the [lack of] oversight of law enforcement in the ports, in the airports.\"\"Who was checking any more?\" he asked.A police car patrols an empty street in Taormina this month after restrictions were imposed to avoid the spread of Covid-19.Exploiting a desperate need for cashBut Mafia groups are about far more than trafficking cocaine. They are deeply embedded in the economy.While traditional Mafia activities such as extortion may suffer during the pandemic, there will also be fresh opportunities, said Anna Sergi, senior lecturer in criminology at the University of Essex.Police investigation into Italian care homes finds coronavirus violationsFranco Gabrielli, head of the Italian police, said that Mafia organizations are already deeply enmeshed in parts of the economy \"that have not been blocked by the restrictions of Covid-19: the agriculture-food chain, the supply of medicines and medical equipment, road transport.\"It's a view shared by Saviano.\"Funeral homes they invest in, hospital laundries. Cleaning companies they've always invested in. Good delivery companies, gas stations, this is the portfolio they've had for the past 10 years,\" he told CNN.Such is the financial muscle of the 'Ndrangheta, Gabrielli said last week, that it could exploit a desperate need for cash faced by businesses it doesn't currently control.\"At the end of the emergency, the criminal associations could have polluted the economy, controlling companies previously not infiltrated,\" he said.Related storiesPutin leverages coronavirus chaos to make direct play to TrumpSome recovered coronavirus patients test positive againEurope has a rescue package. But who's going to pay?Analysis: The EU has bungled its coronavirus responseSergi says past crises have shown that the Mafia can move money quickly outside the banking system and demand fewer guarantees than banks. Lending money to distressed companies and then gradually taking control of them is a well-oiled mafia tactic. Nicola Gratteri, an anti-Mafia investigator and head of the public prosecutor's office in Catanzaro, told CNN that businesses like restaurants and hotels are especially vulnerable.The last great recession, in 2008, offers a sobering comparison. Anti-Mafia groups like SOS Impresa said that crisis turned the Mafia into Italy's largest bank. The Palermo-based group estimated in 2012 that the Mafia had 65 billion euros ($72 billion) in liquidity and described extortionate lending as \"a national emergency.\" At the same time, many Italian banks were struggling to stay afloat and borrowing heavily from the European Central Bank.Saviano believes liquidity will be \"the center of everything\" in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis.\"The organization will come to a company in crisis and say: 'We don't buy everything, but we will give you cash in exchange for shares -- to become part of your company,'\" he said.\"This is what they will do with everyone.\" A parallel stateAt the end of last month, video footage of a couple hammering at the doors of a bank in the southern city of Bari went viral. \"You suck, the state sucks. How are we going to manage?\" the woman shouts.These are exactly the sort of circumstances the Mafia exploits. The 'Ndrangheta and other clans don't simply live off societies where they are strong. They build loyalty by supplying necessities to poorer neighborhoods and cash to struggling businesses.Italy aims to turn suffering to advantage with experimental Covid-19 treatmentTo Gratteri, this is \"a method to create allegiance. If we -- the state -- don't show ourselves to be efficient, what could happen is that the Mafia presents itself as a winning a model, and maybe asks for a return favor at the elections.\"Zora Hauser, a researcher into organized crime at Oxford University, said that \"what we are seeing -- and will see more and more as the economic and social crisis unfolds -- is Mafia groups returning to their core businesses of protection and governance.\" Salvo Palazzolo, a journalist with La Repubblica newspaper, received threats after reporting on food handouts by someone with Mafia connections in the poor \"ZEN\" district of Palermo in Sicily.\"At this moment, Mafia families of Palermo [the Cosa Nostra] are very strong, especially in drugs and online gambling. They have a lot of liquidity,\" Palazzolo told CNN.\"I would say the Cosa Nostra are strengthening their control through welfare assistance to families who are in jail, and now this is spreading to all poor families. They want to show themselves as an alternative to the state.\"In another district of Palermo, a local Mafia boss tried to organize a Good Friday church service in defiance of the lockdown before police intervened. Europe has a rescue package. But who's going to pay for its coronavirus recovery?Criminologist Anna Sergi says the Mafia want the community both to like and need them.The government is aware of the danger. CNN obtained a letter written by Interior Minister Luciana Lamorgese to regional leaders warning that criminal organizations would try to use \"forms of support\" to gain popularity.As Zora Hauser puts it: \"This can be cashed by the organization in different ways, the most worrying one being votes.\"The government has established a 400 million-euro ($435 million) food voucher fund and allotted another 4.3 billion euros ($4.8 billion) to local mayors. As Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte promised on March 28: \"We know that many suffer, but the state is there.\"But it's a daunting challenge. Saviano says that during this crisis, the mafia will try to hire the \"new unemployed\" as its foot soldiers. As many as three million Italians work \"off the books,\" according to multiple surveys. One survey by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 2017 estimated that a quarter of Italians in their early 20s were neither in employment, nor in education or training.Stimulus bonanzaGetting Italy back to work is the government's priority. It's injecting 750 billion euros ($815 billion) into the economy. Part of the investment is to guarantee loans to businesses -- covering more than three-quarters of a large company's borrowing. But given the massive sums being dispersed, anti-Mafia investigators worry that some of those loans, as well as other support, will go to Mafia-run businesses.The EU is facing a 'moment of truth' as it tackles mammoth economic crisis, Macron warnsItaly also wants Europe-wide \"coronabonds,\" basically a pooling of debt among EU member states. One German commentator, Christoph Schiltz, urged German Chancellor Angela Merkel to reject the idea, writing in Die Welt newspaper that \"the mafia is just waiting for a new shower of money from Brussels.\"Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio described Schiltz' comments as \"shameful and unacceptable.\"Saviano said: \"European funds today help the Italian economy that is on its knees. And an Italian economy on its knees means Italy is at the mercy of organised crime.\"It's not just Italy's problem. The Mafia's tentacles spread across Europe and far beyond. The 'Ndrangheta has a Europe-wide network for distributing drugs, often using pizza restaurants as fronts. It has also invested in property.For now, reinforced border controls and nationwide lockdowns are choking distribution networks for drugs. But like the coronavirus, the mafia groups are no respecter of borders. \"The Mafia is very powerful also in Germany,\" said Roberto Saviano. \"They shoot less, but they are very powerful.\"Earlier this month, Pope Francis prayed for \"people who during this time of the pandemic, trade at the expense of the needy and profit from the needs of others, like the Mafia, usurers and others.\"\"May the Lord touch their hearts and convert them,\" the Pope said.History, as well as current evidence, suggests he may be disappointed.CNN's Livia Borghese contributed to this report",

The British Medical Association (BMA) announced its findings Saturday after surveying more than 6,000 doctors across the UK.The results from its survey showed there is a lack of gowns and eye protection in particular, despite the UK government's repeated promises that supply issues are being addressed. Although there has been a slight improvement from its last survey, published on April 7, the BMA urged to government to do more to provide personal protective equipment. One third of NHS staff and key workers tested in the UK have coronavirus, amid concerns over access to protective equipmentDr.Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA's council chair, said: \"Two months into the Covid-19 crisis in Britain, we shouldn't still be hearing that doctors feel unprotected when they go to work,\" he added. Read More\"The government says that 1 billion items will soon have been shipped, and while there have been signs of improvement, our research clearly shows that equipment is not reaching all doctors working on the front line,\" he added. Of those doctors working in high-risk areas, more than a half said were shortages or no supply of full-face visors, according to the survey. Britain's health service is part of its national psyche. It's also on life supportAround a half also said the same was true of long-sleeved disposable gowns and disposable goggles.  The BMA also found that doctors in general practice also reported shortages of eye protection. These findings were released a day after Matt Hancock, the UK Health Secretary, said he could not guarantee that hospitals would not run out of gowns this weekend.He added that the government was doing all it could to sort out supply issues.Earlier this week in an interview with the BBC, Hancock described the deaths of 27 National Health Service (NHS) workers from coronavirus as \"incredibly heartrending.\"The UK government released data on Monday showing that a third of NHS staff and key workers who have been tested for coronavirus returned positive results. The number of coronavirus cases in the UK rose on Saturday by 888 to 15,464, according to the UK Department of Health and Social Care. For updates on the coronavirus pandemic, go here.",

        "content": "(CNN)At first glance, the republic of Georgia has been a success story in the fight against the novel coronavirus: the outbreak in the small Caucasus nation has remained limited, with just 370 official cases as of Friday morning.But Georgia now faces a serious test. Easter will be celebrated this Sunday on the Eastern Christian calendar, and the powerful Georgian Orthodox Church is planning major celebrations that public health officials say could prove deadly. Georgian authorities moved early to respond to the coronavirus. The government closed schools on February 29, when the country had just three confirmed cases. Health experts have credited the swift response with containing the virus early through social distancing and other measures. On Friday, a five-day nationwide ban on private car travel went into effect.The Georgian Orthodox church, however, has largely refused to heed the pleas of public health officials, who have urged people to stay home. Churches across Georgia have remained open and continued to hold ceremonies, a move that experts say could prove disastrous.This past Sunday, thousands gathered in churches across the country to mark Palm Sunday on the Orthodox calendar. The services were an explicit breach of the lockdown decreed by authorities on March 30, which included a ban on gatherings of more than three people. Read MoreThe tradition-bound church has so far refused to adapt communion rites to counter epidemiological concerns. Worshippers line up at the end of each service to  receive the sacrament of communion from the same communal spoon, Reuters reported Thursday. \"The spoon is often not even washed\" between uses, Salome Kandelaki, a project coordinator at the Georgian Institute of Politics who researches religion in Georgia, told CNN. Religious gatherings around the globe inflame the virus A spokesperson for the Georgian Orthodox Church did not return a request for comment. But church officials have been insistent that its traditional practices do no harm.\"It is not possible for this virus to be spread by the church,\" Metropolitan Gerasim, a senior priest who heads a large district in western Georgia, was quoted as saying by Georgian media this week. \"We are healing people, not hurting them.\"Earlier this week, the Prime Minister and the church struck a last-minute deal to allow Easter services to be held, but with some precautions to safeguard parishioners from Covid-19.  Those measures include social distancing, a police presence, and the scaling back of traditional cemetery visit festivities.   But the government, which said the country is entering a peak phase for transmission of the virus, has continued to call on worshipers to stay home regardless.\"In large churches, during the service, a distance of two meters must be maintained, and in small churches only clergy will serve. Each church will have mobilized patrol police crews to monitor curfew and social distance,\" said Irakli Chikovani, the spokesman for Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia, reported Tbilisi Week. \"Citizens must comply with curfew conditions, otherwise measures will be taken.\"Analysts say the government led by the Georgian Dream party, which has aided the church's push for a conservative, family values-oriented society, has been reluctant to enforce anti-coronavirus measures when it comes to the church. \"I am still surprised that [the church] does not think ahead,\" said Tamuna Khoshtaria, senior researcher at the Caucasus Research Resource Center Georgia, a leading independent, non-profit research and survey group. \"But I am more surprised that the government lets them do it, because they have put so much effort into containing the virus. Now it all seems in vain.Observers say that both church and state are imperiling public health. The Georgian health ministry and prime minister's office have not yet responded to a CNN request for comment. Paata Imnadze, deputy head of the National Center for Disease Control, implored citizens to observe social distancing measures, warning that \"if we don't stay at home ... the death rate will be staggering.\" The Georgian church's insistence is all the more remarkable for the measures other Eastern Orthodox churches have taken. The Russian Orthodox Church has officially urged worshipers to stay at home, although some churches continue to hold services. The Church of Greece decided to suspend mass as of March 16.  JUST WATCHEDDespite warnings, churchgoers explain why they're still going to servicesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHDespite warnings, churchgoers explain why they're still going to services 03:38The virus has already inflicted casualties among the Georgian faithful.  An altar boy tested positive on April 7, according to multiple media reports, while on Tuesday, another priest was confirmed to have the virus.     National surveys consistently rank the church as one of Georgia's two most trusted institutions. But the ongoing controversy seems destined to buffet the church's standing in Georgian society, still strong but no longer unassailable.The past few years in general have not been kind to the church's image. A prominent priest was convicted for the attempted murder of the patriarchate's secretary in 2017. Last year, an archbishop was dismissed in an alleged pedophilia scandal.  A forthcoming study by CRRC-Georgia seen by CNN shows a stark reversal. The number of respondents who said they \"fully trusted\" the Georgian Orthodox Church dropped to 38% last year, down from 75% in 2008. The Georgian patriarchate's resistance to change in the current crisis is further pushing some public opinion towards viewpoints critical of the church, with many Georgians voicing criticism on social media. It remains to be seen how parishioners will react to the limitations on the Easter Service. A church spokesman said curfews would be respected by parishioners who will remain at the church from 9 p.m. Saturday to 6 a.m. Sunday to avoid violating the Prime Minister's order, according to press reports. But without the church's explicit support, any further attempts by the government to halt religious ceremonies unilaterally are unlikely to have much effect. \"The patriarchate has called it inexcusable and 'a crime against God' if worshippers are prevented from going to church,\" Kandelaki said.  This Easter, then, will present a major risk for the country. If huge crowds turn out for Easter celebrations, in contravention of calls from leading public health officials, Georgia's record of success in fighting coronavirus could be in doubt.",

Earlier this year, Carlsen made history as he extended his unbeaten run to 111 successive classical games, breaking the 110-game streak set by Sergei Tiviakov in 2005.READ: Grieving Mikaela Shiffrin grateful she saw her father in his final momentsCarlsen competes against Daniil Dubov of Russia.Playing under a different flagFirouzja plays under the flag of FIDE, the global chess organization, after leaving his native Iran to avoid government restrictions. Iran strongly discourages its citizens from competing against Israelis, as a sign of protest against the country and a show of solidarity with the Palestinian people.The teenage grandmaster moved to France at the end of 2019 with his father so he could compete against Israeli opponents.Like chess, the sport of judo has seen fighters go against Iranian authorities' orders to avoid Israeli competition. Judoka Saeid Mollaei said he was ordered to withdraw from the World Judo Championships in 2019 to avoid the possibility of meeting Israeli Sagi Muki in the final.The 27-year-old ignored those warnings and after losing in the semifinals of the competition -- a result he says that emerged from the emotional stress caused by the Iran officials' request -- he traveled to Germany to begin the process of applying for asylum.The Iran Judo Federation was suspended from international competition as a result.",

        "content": "Istanbul (CNN)Taksim Square's flocks of resident pigeons, normally waddling around with full bellies thanks to cups of grains that children toss at them, swoop unhindered straight at the heads of the few passers-by, mostly policemen and media. It feels more like a scene from Alfred Hitchcock's horror thriller \"The Birds\" than one of Istanbul's most crowded squares, normally teeming with Turks and tourists alike.Then again, nothing about the impact Covid-19 is having across the globe is normal or familiar. Read MoreLast weekend, the Turkish government implemented a 48-hour curfew for 31 provinces, impacting three quarters of Turkey's population. And while critics of the government have been calling for these types of severe measures to curb the rise of Covid-19, the initial outcome was disastrous. The curfew was announced just two hours before it was to go into effect -- causing a buying panic in some areas as people flocked to grocery stores and bakeries with little regard for social distancing measures.People queue at shops for food shortly before the curfew in Istanbul, on April 10, 2020. Social media was flooded with coronavirus dark humor: a husband caught in breach of the curfew fleeing the scene leaving his car and wife behind; a man who tries to dodge the penalty fee by saying he doesn't speak Turkish, but the police figure out that he does. Following the chaos around the curfew, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan addressed the nation, arguing that Turkey is strong enough to protect and provide for its citizens, while urging the population to stay at home, and announcing another weekend curfew. In confronting coronavirus, Turkey is charting its own path -- as it does in so many other ways.As governments fumbled their coronavirus response, these four got it right. Here's how. During the week, the stay-at-home order only applies to those under the age of 20 or over 65. All other citizens are in theory allowed to go out, although many small businesses are closed, restaurants are open for delivery or pick-up only, public places like parks are off limits, and banks have limited hours. By contrast, construction sites are in full swing, along with factories and other businesses that are unwilling to take an economic hit. Some experts say partial restrictions like Turkey's can be successful -- as long as those who are vulnerable continue to be protected and those who do venture out follow the appropriate measures. \"It's an alternative strategy,\" said Dr. Muhammad Munir, a virologist at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom, explaining that healthy people going out for routine shopping does not necessarily do any harm. \"Eighty percent of the people infected have recovered. So, if it's healthy people who don't have underlying causes, then that is absolutely helpful. The only benefit of a lockdown is that the spread of the disease will be slow, the pressure on the hospitals will be reduced.\" Dr. Jeremy Rossman, a honorary senior lecturer in Virology at the University of Kent says it's tricky given the numbers of cases that Turkey is reporting daily, and that partial lockdowns are only really effective when done early on and a country still has a low level of cases, or if a country has already peaked and is coming out of a full lockdown.\"At [Turkey's] level, most countries are implementing a full lockdown. A partial lockdown can be good, it can balance keeping some of the economy functioning while still trying to contain the outbreak\" He says. \"It depends on how well the population is adhering to the guidance and how well physical distancing and hand hygiene are being implemented in workplaces. But at the rate Turkey is going right now, there is risk this won't be sufficient.\"Pigeons fly around a deserted Taksim Square after a two-day curfew imposed to stem the spread of coronavirus in Istanbul. Turkey is among the top 10 countries in the world when it comes to confirmed coronavirus cases, and its toll is increasing by more than 4,000 cases per day. And the mortality rate has been much lower here than elsewhere -- which has raised eyebrows. The Turkish Medical Association (TMA) says Turkey's official coronavirus death statistics do not include cases that strongly indicate Covid-19 but test negative. \"Doctors that belong to our association have reported that even those CT scans and/or clinical findings indicate the disease, if PCR test results are not positive, if the patient dies they are not recorded as Covid-19,\" the TMA said in their report. CT scans are imaging tests, while PCR tests are used to detect the RNA of the virus. Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca argues that Turkey's mortality rate -- just above 2% -- is due to the country's large healthcare capacity and a treatment protocol that is different than other countries. Koca says that, unlike other countries, Turkey's approach to fighting Covid-19 centers around contact tracing instead of general testing or testing after clinical presentation.They have also been delaying intubation by using high frequency oxygen for a longer period of time, which he says has yielded better results. Coronavirus: Latest news on the Covid-19 global pandemic And Turkey uses the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir, a Japanese antiviral, much earlier than other countries in the onset of Covid-19, Koca says. But Lancaster University's Dr. Munir is one of many medical experts who opposes the use of the malaria drug. He said the risk of the side effects outweighs any benefit that using hydroxychloroquine may have. \"Treatments have very little impact,\" he explained. \"When it comes to hydroxychloroquine, the patients might have recovered from Covid-19 anyway, but after a year they might see heart problems coming back, that blindness is appearing. This is why there isn't enough evidence to approve these drugs on a mass scale.\" \"We are trying to save lives,\" says Dr. Nuri Aydin, the president of Istanbul University-Cerrrahpasa School of Medicine, one of the hospitals leading Turkey's response. \"What we have seen is that the time that the patients spend in the ICU decreases when they take hydroxychloroquine before they reach the stage where they have to enter the ICU.\" Aydin says there isn't enough data to publish their findings yet and that \"time will show us the real results.\" And he adds that they are doing something else differently: Rather than having their patients lying face up, they are keeping many in the prone, ie face down, position. This, he says, has yielded positive results as well. And Turkey has started using plasma from patients that already contracted the disease on those that are still fighting it.  The government says its ICUs still have plenty of capacity and there is no shortage of hospital beds. And Turkey, which did not report its first case until mid-March, had time to prepare. Indeed, Turkey's hospital system is so good that the country has become a medical tourism destination. In response to Covid-19, the country quickly developed programs to manufacture and distribute personal protective equipment (PPE) not just within Turkey itself, but overseas as well -- sending cargo loads to more than 30 countries, including the UK, Spain, and Italy. The gesture of solidarity and goodwill is also perhaps aimed at rebuilding Turkey's frayed ties with its NATO allies. Ministry of Education vocational schools in Istanbul and elsewhere have been turned into workshops churning out face masks, body suits, and surgical gowns intended for in-country use. Soldiers walk at the empty mausoleum of the founder of the Turkish Republic Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in Ankara on March 23.Others produce face shields and gallons and gallons of disinfectants, hand sanitizers, and other essential cleaning products. Masks are obligatory in public places like markets, but are not sold anywhere anymore.  That was banned because the government is distributing them free at pharmacies, or for those who can't go out, straight to their homes. Turkey is easing the burden of the epidemic on those under stay at home orders by sending volunteers and police door to door to make sure vulnerable people have the services they need. Call centers called \"Acik Kapi\" -- Open Door -- area located in every district where those elderly citizens under stay-at-home orders can call in requesting anything from a grocery delivery, pharmacy purchase or their monthly retirement cash. Eyup is one of Istanbul's populous historic districts, where the phone rings nonstop. Serdar Karakus, a school headmaster's assistant, and Ugur Uyan, a neighborhood mosque imam, have been authorized to withdraw people's retirement funds and deliver them to citizens who request their service.  They are both volunteers who say they do this as their duty to their country and their people. \"My parents are elderly. I live in Istanbul. They live in Manatya. They are receiving this service where they are because I am not there to help them,\" Karakus said. \"But someone there is. So to do this for the elderly here, it's like I am doing it for my own parents.\" A few hours later we join a group of policemen who are doing the rounds handing out face masks and Kolonya, a traditional Turkish version of hand sanitizer made up of 80 percent alcohol, usually scented with lemon fragrance. Sadet Seker, in her 70s, lives alone. Her husband passed away years ago. She speaks to her children regularly on the phone.  But the last time she hugged them -- the last time she had physical contact with them -- was two or three months ago. She's not sure. We ask if they are in Istanbul. \"Yes, they are in Istanbul,\" she replies and then starts to shake, her eyes filling with tears. They are so close, and yet they might as well be so far away. How soon she can actually see them will depend on whether or not Turkey's Covid-19 strategy is a successful gamble.",

        "content": "(CNN)Captain Tom Moore, the now famous 99-year-old British war veteran who has raised more than \u00a319 million ($23.7 million) for the UK's National Health Service (NHS) by walking 100 laps of his garden, has said he is \"absolutely overwhelmed\" by the sum he has been able to raise. Moore, who will turn 100 later this month, began a JustGiving fundraiser on April 8, initially hoping to raise \u00a31,000 for NHS Charities Together, which raises funds for UK hospitals, including for staff, volunteers and patients affected by the coronavirus crisis.He completed the challenge on Thursday, after walking 10 laps of his garden each day, aided by a walking frame. He told CNN he never anticipated being able to raise such a sum.Moore walked 100 lengths of his back garden.  \"I'm absolutely overwhelmed by this sum of money -- and when you transfer those into American dollars it's even bigger. We really never, ever for a minute thought we would get to this sort of money. We started off with a little modest figure,\" he told CNN's Hala Gorani on the \"Connect The World\" show on Friday. Born in Yorkshire, northern England, Moore trained as a civil engineer before being enlisted in the British Army during World War II, where he served in India, Indonesia and Britain. He later became the managing director of a concrete manufacturer.Read MoreFollowing the death of his wife in 2006, Moore moved in with his daughter, son-in-law and two grandchildren in Bedfordshire, southeast England, where he still lives.Asked why he believed his fundraiser had struck a chord with so many people, he said: \"I think because our National Health Service is good -- they do so good for me -- I had a broken hip and I had cancer and they treated me magnificently. \"I think people realize that...everyone, wherever they are, gets equally treated, just as well, with the same efficiency and kindness that we get from our nurses and doctors -- who, after all, at the moment are on the firing line (of the coronavirus crisis).\"There are growing calls for Moore to be honored for his service to the UK. More than 500,000 people have signed an online petition calling on the government to give him a knighthood. Captain Tom MooreA  spokeswoman for Number 10 Downing Street said in a statement that Prime Minister Boris Johnson will look at ways to recognize Moore's efforts.\"Tom has captured the heart of the nation with his heroic efforts and raised an incredible amount of money for hard working NHS staff,\" the spokeswoman said in the statement.\"He has embodied the spirit of the whole country in doing their bit for the battle against coronavirus to support the NHS and save lives. From his military contributions to his support for NHS staff, Tom has demonstrated a lifetime of bravery and compassion.\"The PM will certainly be looking at ways to recognize Tom for his heroic efforts.\"Moore completed his 100-length challenge at his home on Thursday.Tributes and thanks, meanwhile, have poured in from around the world for his fundraising efforts.UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Thursday he was \"inspired\" by Moore's efforts. On Friday, Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, said in an interview with BBC Breakfast that Moore was a \"fundraising machine.\"\"It's wonderful that everyone has been inspired by his story and his determination,\" he said. \"I think he's a one-man fundraising machine and god knows what the final total will be but good on him, I hope he keeps going.\"Asked what he made of being called a hero, Moore thanked people for \"their kind remarks\" and said: \"Let me assure you -- eventually, we shall all get through it, and all will be well in the end.\"",

        "content": "London (CNN)Coronavirus travel restrictions have led to a labor crisis for British agricultural sectors that traditionally rely on seasonal migrant workers from Europe,  forcing some employers to bring workers in on charter flights.One of the UK's largest produce suppliers, G's Fresh, said it had chartered a plane to bring workers to the UK from Romania on Thursday \"to ensure we have enough seasonal agricultural workers to continue to feed our nation.\"Air Charter Service told CNN it was flying 150 workers from Romania to London's Stansted Airport and had five more flights planned over the coming weeks, bringing about 900 people in total.The need to bring in workers from eastern Europe to feed British families has exposed the UK's reliance on typically low-paid immigrants to prop up services that keep the nation running.The UK government says it's working with the industry to help fill what the National Farmers' Union estimates is around 70,000 seasonal worker roles. NFU President Tom Bradshaw said in a statement that growers were \"extremely concerned\" about the impact of coronavirus on this critical workforce, calling on workers furloughed from other jobs in the UK to \"pick for Britain.\"Fruit pickers pick strawberries at a fruit farm in Hereford, UK.Read MoreThe charity Concordia said it has had 35,000 expressions of interest in its Feed the Nation recruitment campaign, but only 5,500 chose to go through to interview stage. \"That uptake, it gives you an indication that these aren't jobs that everyone is willing to do,\" Fizza Qureshi, CEO at Migrants' Rights Network, told CNN.Related storiesPandemic could threaten global food supplyUK has failed its most vulnerableTrack the spread of the coronavirusLive updates on the coronavirusShe said the crisis showed \"how important migrant workers are for the UK in terms of its economy, society and how they have an essential role to play in some of the lowest paid sectors around, unfortunately.\" There are fears that the coronavirus crisis is a foretaste of difficulties that could flow from Brexit. The ability for the UK to set its own immigration rules, rather than accept unlimited migration from the EU, played a big part in the 2016 referendum campaign. Before the pandemic hit, the UK government published its plan for a post-Brexit immigration system.Under a new \"points-based\" scheme, prospective immigrants would be scored on their skills, earning potential and qualifications. There was no pathway for so-called lower-skilled, lower paid workers; instead, the government said it would expands its seasonal workers visa scheme to bring in 10,000 people a year. Critics of the plan said it would exclude some grades of nurses and almost all care workers, sectors that depend on a strong migrant labor force. Questions over new immigration lawsLegislation to pave the way for the new rules was due to be introduced in parliament next week. But with lawmakers due to convene via video conference, and with questions being raised over the suitability of the system in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, it's not clear whether the bill will be introduced as planned.Robert McNeil, Deputy Director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, told CNN that the coronavirus crisis underscored Britain's reliance on a steady stream of workers from abroad. \"It's a taste of what happens without access to low-skilled migrant labor,\" he said. \"Industries have been created on the basis of there being access to this labor. We've created business models around that.\"A picker moves down a polytunnel at Clock House Farm in southeast England, in September 2018.McNeil said tens of thousands of people could fall through the administrative cracks of the government's EU settlement scheme, which will allow some to continue to live and work in the UK after Brexit. They may miss the application deadlines or not have certain documentation, he said -- and these could be the very people preoccupied with doing vital jobs as grocery store employees, delivery drivers and garbage collectors, as well as working for National Health Service.\"Can you imagine how the public would respond now, if they knew that the nurse that potentially was treating them was going to be told that she was an illegal immigrant and deported?\" British politicians are concerned a 'virtual parliament' cannot hold Boris Johnson's government to account over coronavirusThe government has lowered the salary threshold under its proposed immigration system to \u00a326,500 ($33,000). But Qureshi said that's still unrealistically high for many roles filled by migrants. She said a long-term solution was needed, since care homes, for example, cannot pay workers more without government support.Migrants must be paid a living wage and not just valued in transactional terms, Qureshi said. \"They're on the frontline as nurses, as care workers and keeping our transport systems alive. I just don't think it's been recognized until now and it's a shame that it's taken a crisis to do that.\"\"There are individuals out there who have literally put their lives on the line for us.\"\"Migrants benefit us in so many other ways beyond the economy. That's overlooked unfortunately, by the government, but sometimes also by the media and the general public who only see the worth of a migrant through them being a commodity.\"",

        "content": "Copenhagen (CNN)This week, as younger children across Denmark walked onto school grounds, school bags on their backs and holding parents by the hand, things seemed almost normal. Almost.Jimmy Skov Glasdam Adetunji, head of secondary education at the Hendriksholm School in Rodovre, just outside Copenhagen, spent Wednesday going through classrooms with a measuring stick to ensure the 440 students could be seated at least two meters (six feet) apart when they arrived on Thursday. He had split the schoolyard into six sections with red and white barrier tape, and sent a detailed diagram to parents outlining staggered arrival times, routes, breaks and lunch times.\"I can't wait to see the kids again,\" Adetunji said. \"But we will obviously have to talk about the pandemic and the rules and why our playground is now marked by police tape. So, it's going to be a contrast between fun and seriousness.\"School children have their lunch break at the Korshoejskolen public school in Randers, Denmark, on April 15.A few miles away, in Bronshoj, Philip Mundt was dropping his six-year old son Emil for his first day back. \"He is so excited,\" Philip said, laughing. \"All the way here, he's been talking about how he's going to see his friends and that this is the best day of his life. He is really looking forward to this.\"Read MoreSchools across Denmark raised flags in celebration as they welcomed back younger students this week, with an excitement comparable to a first day of school. And it is the first day of school in over a month, after Denmark announced widespread closures on March 11 to contain the spread of the coronavirus. The country was among the first in Europe to close borders, shops, schools and restaurants, and to ban large gatherings, among other measures. Now, it is one of the first to begin reopening.The country has seen a continued drop in hospital admissions. More than 500 people were hospitalized with the coronavirus during March but, by mid-April, the number hospitalized had dropped to 353 -- unlike the explosive rise seen in some other countries. As of April 16, 321 people had died, according to Denmark's infectious diseases agency, the Statens Serum Institute.     \"What we did right was that we closed down society very early in the epidemic and very efficiently,\" said Allan Randrup Thomsen, professor of experimental virology at the University of Copenhagen. \"So I do think there is room at this stage of the epidemic to open up some parts of society.\"The gradual reopening of Denmark was announced by Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen earlier this month, along with a decision to let the younger students through fifth grade, or approximately age 12, be part of phase one. Their schools must ensure new hygiene and distancing measures, however, to protect students and staff. Teacher Rebekka Hjorth has a music lesson with her class outdoors at the Korshoejskolen public school in Randers, Denmark, on April 15.Government regulations now require Adetunji to make sure the children are split into smaller groups, can wash their hands immediately upon arrival and at least every two hours, and that contact surfaces like sinks, toilet seats and door handles are disinfected twice daily, among other things, before he can open the school. Schools are also printing maps that mark entrance and exit routes and ensuring children remain outside as much as possible.This is the reality of life under the pandemic -- and one even the children seem prepared for. Ask any one of them and they are likely to promptly recite you the rules about hand washing, keeping their distance, not sharing food and not getting too close to each other in the playground.But Thomsen acknowledges that risk remains.Parents stand with their children as they wait to enter Stengaard School north of Copenhagen, Denmark, on April 15.\"(Students are) a relatively large group of people -- about 10% of the Danish population -- and one that is difficult to control in terms of social behavior and hygienic precautions,\" he said. \"The institutions have done a lot to reduce risk but whether that will work is something we will probably see in the next two weeks or so.\"Adetunji and other school leaders say that while there has been some concern from parents and teachers about sending the youngest children back to school in that first wave, the vast majority has been supportive of the decision.\"I don't think it is a secret that we have been asked to open the schools so parents can go back to work. At the same time, I think it is the right decision. The kids really need this social interaction,\"  Adetunji said.Judging by their reactions, he may be right. Pandemic or not, life wants to be lived -- especially when you're a six-year-old.The Danish government said Friday that it would relax more of its restrictive measures, with courts and some small businesses like hairdressers', chiropractors and driving schools set to reopen on April 20.Denmark seems to be on its way to life after the coronavirus -- with the youngest leading the way into the new normal.",

        "content": "(CNN)Faced with disrupted supply chains and steep revenue declines due to the coronavirus pandemic, one zoo is considering a drastic measure: turning some of its residents into food.The longer that the coronavirus lockdowns continue and the more dire financial situations become, the more realistic it is that Neum\u00fcnster Zoo in northern Germany will have to consider its absolute, last resort plan: slaughtering some of its zoo animals to feed others.The Neum\u00fcnster Zoo, home to more than 700 animals and more than 100 species, has drafted an emergency plan listing which animals would be euthanized to cut costs, and in what order, zoo director Verena Kaspari told German news agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur (DPA). Stray dogs and coronavirus: Just a hypothetical theory with no proofThough it's unclear which animals would be slaughtered first, a polar bear named Vitus -- which stands nearly 12 feet tall -- would be the last animal to go.\"If -- and this is really the worst, worst case of all -- if I no longer have any money to buy feed, or if it should happen that my feed supplier is no longer able to supply due to new restrictions, then I would slaughter animals to feed other animals,\" Kaspari told the news agency.Read MoreKaspari said she would rather euthanize the zoo's animals than have them starve.CNN has reached out to Neum\u00fcnster Zoo for comment.German zoos in crisisNow that the Neum\u00fcnster Zoo is no longer generating revenue from visitors due to the national shutdown enacted on March 15, the zoo is operating solely through donations, Kaspari told DPA. The German government has started rolling out an economic rescue package worth up to \u20ac750 billion ($825 billion) -- among the largest relief packages launched anywhere in the world. The package includes measures to spur lending to businesses, take stakes in companies and support furloughed workers, though it's unclear whether zoos are receiving funds.\"We're an association and don't get any city money, and all the state money we've applied for so far hasn't arrived yet,\" Kaspari told DPA.How do you reopen the economy after coronavirus? German experts have a planThe Association of Zoological Gardens (VdZ), a Berlin-based zoo association with members in Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Spain, has asked Chancellor Angela Merkel for \u20ac100 million in emergency aid. VdZ represents 56 zoos in Germany, including Neum\u00fcnster Zoo.The association said in a letter to the country's government that many of the animals in its member zoos are endangered species and a part of international conservation breeding programs.\"A possible loss of this valuable animal population would be a bitter setback for our struggle to conserve biodiversity and would therefore amount to a catastrophe,\" VdZ President J\u00f6rg Junhold said in a statement.The association noted that unlike other facilities, zoos can't shut down or limit operations to cut down on losses. Animals still have to be fed and cared for, often an expensive endeavor.CNN's Nadine Schmidt and Claudia Otto contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Italian authorities are looking into a string of health violations at elderly care homes across the country, amid a devastating coronavirus crisis.Inspections by the Italian Police health force -- Nuclei Antisofisticazione e Sanita (NAS) -- found that 17% of the first 600 elder care homes to be inspected had failed to follow national coronavirus protocols.Italy closes ports to rescue ships, targeting migrantsThese violations included a lack of protective equipment for staff, and an absence of dedicated quarantine space to isolate suspected coronavirus patients, NAS said.Fifteen facilities have been closed and their patients relocated, NAS told CNN. Sixty-one people have been referred to judicial authorities which, because of the nationwide lockdown that has closed courts, will investigate using best practices until the lockdown is lifted. Following that, a full judicial process will be carried out. Another 157 people linked to elder care facilities were fined, amounting to a total of more than $78,500 (72,000 euros).The NAS announcement came on Wednesday, as Pope Francis prayed for the elderly in nursing homes at his morning mass, which was live streamed from Rome. Read more: Italy aims to turn suffering to advantage with experimental Covid-19 treatmentI have a silk mask to match my wedding dressI watched as the US paid too little attention to Italy's sufferingRead More\"Pope Francis's intention for Wednesday's Mass was for the elderly, especially those who are isolated or in nursing homes,\" the Vatican press office said in a statement. \"Many of them, he said, are afraid of dying alone. But 'they are our roots, our story, our history.'\" The elderly are more at risk for severe and fatal coronavirus infections, and have been particularly hard hit in Italy. But there is little public information on how the virus may spread through nursing homes and residential senior centers. Italy's health authority does not count deaths in elder care homes as Covid-19 deaths -- even if patients are suspected to have died with the virus -- and testing for the virus on the deceased in care homes is not standard practice.As northern Italy is ravaged by coronavirus, there's trouble brewing down south The NAS's focus on elder care homes in Italy follows the death of more than 60 residents at one facility and a criminal investigation into another: the Pio Albergo Trivulzio home in Milan, which is under scrutiny for \"more than 100 deaths,\" according to Milan's Public Prosecutor Mauro Clerici.Authorities are looking at charges related to contributing to the spread of the virus and manslaughter in the Pio Albergo Tivulzio case, he said. \"The investigation is underway into what crimes may have been committed in accordance with existing legislation as applied to a pandemic,\" Clerici told CNN. No arrests have been made and no one has yet been charged in the case. Under Italian law, authorities have up to a year to press charges after the initial investigation is launched.The facility told CNN it would not comment on the ongoing investigation. \"The rules regarding masks were followed,\" a spokeswoman of Pio Albergo Trivulzio told CNN. She added that the number of deaths in the first quarter of 2020 were in line with those in the same period last year. Staffers wearing protective outfits walk at the Pio Albergo Trivulzio nursing home in Milan on Tuesday, April 7, 2020.Italian Carabinieri, Italy's national military police, told CNN that it has also begun carrying out checks in elder care facilities to ensure that visitor access, the management of personal protective equipment, staff training and quarantine spaces are in accordance with a decree issued by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on stopping the spread of the novel coronavirus. The checks have already resulted in fines, and the complete closure of at least one facility.Italian hermit living alone on an island says self-isolation is the ultimate journey The umbrella group for Italian nursing homes (Associazione Nazionale Strutture Terza Eta) told CNN that it will work to provide additional training and support for all member care centers.Elderly care centers are \"biological time bombs,\" Raffaele Antonelli Incalzi, head of Italian geriatric society SIGG, said last week. That is partly due to the fact that overcrowded hospitals are moving elderly patients into unprepared care facilities in order to free up space for urgent treatments, he explained. \"Creating modules for Covid in care homes (RSA) means putting elderly residents at risk who are the weakest link in this pandemic,\" Incalzi said.",

        "content": "Rome (CNN)For nearly a month, Italy held the awful distinction of having the most coronavirus deaths of any country in the world -- topping China, the original epicenter, in mid-March, and being overtaken by the United States three and a half weeks later.But now doctors are hoping to turn Italy's terrible suffering to its advantage.The country is pinning its hopes on using the blood plasma of Covid-19 survivors to help those who are suffering most from it in hospitals now. \"Good can come out of this,\" said Dr. Fausto Baldanti.  \"We had such a huge outbreak, [that] now we have many potential donors.\"People who recover from an infection, or who tested positive but never experienced symptoms, develop antibodies in their blood plasma. Those antibodies can be transfused into another victim, where they might help to neutralize the virus in the recipient's body.Read MoreFor decades, doctors have used plasma or even whole blood from recovered patients to treat the newly infected.Baldanti is a virologist at the University of Pavia San Matteo Hospital in Italy's northern Lombardy region, which has seen the most cases and deaths in the country. He hopes \"this plasma treatment can be crucial for controlling the infection in patients admitted to intensive care units.\"Doctor Cesare Perotti, director of the immunotransfusion service at the University of Pavia San Matteo Hospital, holds a bag of plasma after a donation.\nThat's the theory, anyway -- but the treatment is still in the experimental phase in Italy.It depends on the development of a proven test for coronavirus antibodies -- which is not yet available. (In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration just tightened restrictions on antibody tests after an earlier relaxing of the rules led to a flood of low-quality tests.)Antibody tests, also known as serology tests, don't diagnose active infection with the coronavirus. Rather, they check for proteins in the immune system -- antibodies -- through a blood sample.The presence of antibodies may mean a person has at least some immunity -- although experts are not sure how strong the immunity may be or how long it will last.The director general of the Italian National Blood Center hopes to have a test ready within weeks.\"We should have a serological exam (blood test) that is approved to test if someone has antibodies by the end of April. We will start selecting the first donors by the end of the month,\" Giancarlo Maria Liumbruno told CNN.\"This new initiative would allow us to go through our 1,700,000 blood donors in Italy, to see who has been infected or is asymptomatic and has developed antibodies,\" he said.He recovered from the coronavirus and now his plasma donation could save the lives of othersOnce an antibody test is approved, Italy plans to open its blood banks to donations from people with coronavirus antibodies, Liumbruno said.The test would allow scientists to select the most effective blood donors, San Matteo hospital virologist Baldanti explained: \"So, who has the highest activity of the virus? You use that plasma to infuse into the sick patients.\"The project aims to recruit repeat voluntary plasma donors with antibodies, Liumbruno said.In northern Italy, trials have already begun at some hospitals of treating patients with plasma from an individual who has recovered from the virus and has tested negative for it for at least 14 days.The plasma is separated from blood cells in a process called plasmapheresis and intravenously given to a Covid-19 patient.   Plasma could also be the key to creating an effective drug therapy, according to Liumbruno.Hospitals from the hard-hit northern region are working with Kedrion Biopharma, a global biotech company with production facilities in Italy and the United States.It is one of four companies authorized by Italy's National Health Service to fractionate plasma from blood banks.   It is working on a plasma-derived treatment for Covid-19 and expects it to be ready in three to six months, according to its Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Alessandro Gringeri.\"Initially we will use plasma from about 100 patients who have recovered from Covid-19 in order to develop a dosage that can be injected through either intravenous or intramuscular means,\" Gringeri said. \"We will generate a plasma-derived immunoglobulin therapy that can be administered to either patients who are suffering from Covid-19 or health care workers to provide temporary passive immunization.\"Gringeri says the company plans to start collecting plasma from convalescent patients by the end of May, with a hope of having a prototype of the treatment by the end of September.If the theory proves successful in practice, Italy's tragedy may at least turn out to contain the seeds of a solution.",

As Spain enters its second month of lockdown, some restrictions were eased, allowing those who cannot work from home, such as those in the construction and manufacturing industries, to return to work.However, shops, bars, and restaurants and other businesses considered nonessential remain closed.Drive-through funerals are being held in the epicenter of Spain's coronavirus pandemicSpain has been one of the countries worst affected by the coronavirus pandemic, with more than 169,000 confirmed cases so far -- the highest in Europe, and second only to the US, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. The country has now recorded a total of more than 17,400 deaths. On Monday, it recorded the second-lowest daily rise in deaths for three weeks: 517 fatalities in the past 24 hours.Read MoreA cautious climbdownBut Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has cautioned that the nation's return to normal life will be \"progressive,\" stressing that the resumption of normal activity will happen in phases and will be accompanied by hygiene measures and efforts to monitor new cases and prevent further contagion.\"We can't even know what kind of normality we're returning to,\" he said last week.Spanish Red Cross volunteers distribute face masks at the Chamartin Station in Madrid on April 13.Over the weekend, the government announced that police would begin handing out 10 million protective masks at metro stations and other transport hubs, while reiterating guidance on social distancing and regular hand-washing.  Spain's central government has distributed one million coronavirus testing kits around the country, and a further five million will be sent out in the coming days and weeks.\"The climb has been difficult, the descent will also be,\" Sanchez told parliament last week, as the country's state of emergency was extended to April 26. Sanchez has warned that restrictions may need to be further extended.Spanish workers wear masks leaving the subway on April 13, in Madrid.  'Irresponsible and reckless'Still, the easing of restrictions has triggered concern in some quarters.Spain's General Workers Union (GTU) has raised concerns over the safety of those returning to work.

Quim Torra, president of Catalonia, said returning people to work was \"irresponsible and reckless\" in a video statement posted to his verified Twitter account.Last week, a study published in medical journal The Lancet warned that coronavirus lockdowns across the globe should not be completely lifted until a vaccine for the disease is found. The study, based on China's outbreak, used mathematical modeling to show how lifting such measures prematurely could result in a sweeping second wave of infection. Spain is one of several European countries cautiously preparing to loosen restrictions. Austria said it would gradually begin to reopen shops after Easter, and in Germany a group of economists, lawyers and medical experts are recommending a gradual revival that would allow specific industries and workers to resume their activities while steps are taken to prevent a resurgence of coronavirus. Meanwhile, Denmark will reopen kindergartens and schools this week if coronavirus cases remain stable, and children in Norway will return to kindergarten a week later.",

This is a person that I knew well by then. The person I know the most in the world. He's extraordinary, he's generous, and he's very tender and loving.\"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange prepares to speak from the balcony of the Ecuadorian embassy on February 5, 2016 in London, England.

It was what keeps things real. And it does.

He had been holed up at the embassy, yards from the Harrods department store in Knightsbridge, since 2012, when he was granted asylum as part of a bid to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he was facing allegations of sexual assault. The Swedish case has since been dropped, but Assange feared US extradition due to his work with WikiLeaks and remained in the embassy.

However, the judge delayed making the woman's identity public until 4 p.m. on April 14, pending a possible judicial review at the High Court.WikiLeaks spokesman Joseph Farrell told CNN on Monday: \"Ms. Moris did not take this decision lightly. She has protected her family's privacy fiercely for many years. She wanted to speak in support of Julian's bail application given the grave risk to his health amidst the Covid-19 pandemic and the judge refused her anonymity, forcing her to go public. She is a serious, intelligent and principled person -- and a brilliant legal analyst.\"Lawyer Aitor Mart\u00ednez, a member of Assange's legal team, told CNN that Moris has worked with their team since the beginning. \"She has always been very protective of her privacy, and this is why she is not used to interacting with the press and has not been exposed to it before,\" Mart\u00ednez said.Assange's extradition hearing in London is due to continue on May 18.",

Hauser wanted to raise awareness about what he says is the untapped, clean energy potential of the jet stream, a high-altitude air current in the atmosphere.\"So I just jump with a kind of fear,\" Hauser told CNN Sport as he confessed that he's only been successful in \"managing\" how he feels about heights.\"I'm still scared of it.

Entry levelBefore he performed his free fall jump into the jet stream in Australia in 2018, Hauser was already an unofficial record holder for the fastest horizontal speed without additional gear, reaching a top speed of 188.9 mph in 2012. Although it has not, he says, been \"ratified yet\" by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale (FAI), Hauser's record has been validated by their most experienced GPS specialist, Brian Utley.While many elite athletes are conscious of putting on weight, the opposite is true of the six foot seven-inch Swiss, who decided to take on more adventurous pursuits after going on a skydiving course in Spain aged 19. \"I really had to gain weight. I really had to become heavier because the heavier you are, the more free fall acceleration you get,\" the 47-year-old said. Through a combination of \"good healthy food and some not so healthy -- a couple of beers,\" Hauser managed to put on the 12 kilograms he required to reach his ideal weight. Since then, he has maintained his weight of 110kg. \"It's like when you're on a bike, and if you drive downhill, then you lose against the fat guy.\"READ: As well as breaking records 'Queen of Speed' is standing up to bulliesHauser describes himself as being an \"an adventurer all (his) life.\"'Superhero syndrome'Hauser quickly discovered he was in a league of his own when it came to skydiving.\"I didn't have any class because my suit has no wings. And so, my definition was I was 'flying with zero wingsuit.' And I was ranked number one,\" he said. To his surprise, he began to fall down the rankings because officials started taking tailwinds into account, which is where the idea to jump into the jet stream came from. \"I said, 'Okay, let's take the best tailwind you can find,'\" recalls Hauser. Hauser during training in Spain.Jet streams are defined as \"narrow bands of strong wind in the upper levels of the atmosphere\" by the USA's National Weather Service. Usually located four to eight miles above ground level, winds can surpass 275 mph and temperatures can sink to as low as minus 40 degrees Celsius. \"To combine kind of a superman stunt with a higher cause, I have this kind of superhero syndrome,\" reflects the Bern native. \"So I would like to fly without wings and at the same time, I would like to save the planet.\"With the help of director and filmmaker Claudio von Planta, Hauser's jump was immortalized in an award-winning documentary \"Chasing the Jet Stream.\"  READ: After Tokyo 2020 postponement, money has become a real worry for OlympianHauser hopes his documentary \"ignites the fire\" in developing technology that can harness the energy potential of the jet stream.Putting his body on the lineWhile Hauser's body has been through a lot  -- he's had six operations on his right knee -- jumping into the jet stream pushed him to the limit.He underwent strenuous training, including experiencing minus 60 degrees Celsius temperatures, trialing a previously untested breathing apparatus and high-altitude training. And while the physical strain he put his body through was \"challenging,\" it was the mental aspect of his preparation that really tested Hauser. \"Mentally, it was really, really hard to keep the team together, to find the good weather window, to find the shoestring budget we ended up with at the end,\" said Hauser, who also works as a keynote speaker.\"But I was really the one guy who had to push in front of the whole team. And I really learned a lot about leadership because we didn't have the money to pay the team. So all the guys, they were working just for free and it was absolutely mind blowing.\"READ: Experts warn lockdown could come at 'psychological cost' to footballersAfter being forced to move to Australia for the jump, Hauser thought the chances of him actually jumping into the jet stream were \"maximum 10%.\"A bumpy rideHaving already had to move the jump from Switzerland to Australia, Hauser's team spent two weeks chasing the perfect location like a \"tornado-chasing team.\"He was assisted by hot air balloon pilot, Steve Griffin, and skydiver, Tom Naef, and after climbing to 7,000m, the problems began. The drop in temperature meant the oxygen regulators for Griffin and Naef froze open. It was so cold the hot air burners also froze, extinguishing the balloon's flame.While Hauser had anticipated complications, the number of problems \"put a bit of a rush\" on his exit, he said, meaning he jumped from a lower altitude than he had hoped for. That meant Hauser failed to break his own speed record but, with hindsight, he describes breaking his own record as a \"silly thing anyway.\"\"I'm still the record holder of non-supported flight over ground without tailwind. But I'm sure you can be way faster than I was,\" he said. Although he was terrified for the safety of the two remaining passengers in the balloon, Hauser managed to complete the skydive.Hauser is already planning a new documentary series, focusing on \"adventure stories combined with a higher sense.\"Proving his pointEtching his name into the record books was one of his aims, but Hauser's primary focus was to shine a light on the jet stream's potential to provide a source of sustainable energy. \"It's just in the beginning. There are about a dozen start-ups worldwide and they are really at the edge in jumping into the market,\" he said. But to take high-altitude wind farming to the next level, the industry needs a \"couple of pioneers with deep pockets.\"\"They are all at the same point where they're now really needing substantial finance to go to the next level and to build these things for the markets and to bring the prices down,\" he said. \"Because now they're working on prototypes, they are flying that proof of concept. But for the next step, they all have the same problem. They need substantial funding, and that's what they are all looking for. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos\"This is a solution, I think, which is not really well known. I think most people, they just know the winter mills and with that comes the wind energy. And the high-altitude wind power is just a new phenomenon to most of us.\"",

She's obviously on the front line and I imagine will be very focused on her job,\" Ardern told reporters on Monday.And McGee's high school, Verdon College in Invercargill, offered its \"sincerest admiration\" for its former pupil.In Portugal, meanwhile, President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said he has \"already personally thanked the nurse Lu\u00eds Pitarma, while also thanking the commitment of all Portuguese health professionals who, in Portugal and around the world, are providing crucial help in the fight against the pandemic.\"'A surreal time'Johnson was admitted to St Thomas' Hospital in Central London on April 5 and went into intensive care the following day, having previously tested positive for Covid-19.\"The NHS has saved my life, no question,\" he said on Sunday after being discharged. \"It's hard to find the words to express my debt.\"He used the message to highlight a number of doctors and nurses, paying particular tribute to McGee and Pitarma. Luis Pitarma, the Portuguese nurse whom Johnson thanked in his video message\"The reason, in the end, my body did start to get enough oxygen was because for every second of the night, they were watching and they were thinking and they were caring, and making the interventions I needed,\" Johnson said.McGee's parents, Caroline and Mike, told TV New Zealand that their daughter Jenny has had a \"surreal\" time.\"It makes us feel exceptionally proud obviously,\" Caroline McGee said. \"But she has told us these things over the years and it doesn't matter what patient she's looking after, this is what she does.\"\"And I just find it incredible that she -- that any person -- can do this for 12 hours, sit and watch a patient.\"Ardern, meanwhile, noted that \"nurse Jenny\" is just one of the \"many, many Kiwis\" who work in healthcare around the world.\"They show the same commitment, same care, same work ethic that they do here, and we are all very proud of them -- especially you, nurse Jenny,\" Ardern said.Johnson recovering at country residenceWorkers in Britain's National Health Service are battling the country's brutal coronavirus outbreak, which has so far claimed at least 10,612 lives.At least 19 NHS workers have died so far, and Johnson's government has been criticized by many in the profession for failing to provide its workforce with enough testing or personal protective equipment.Johnson tested negative for Covid-19 before leaving hospital, a government spokesperson said on Monday.It is hard to find the words to express my debt to the NHS for saving my life.The efforts of millions of people across this country to stay home are worth it.

He noted that there are no scheduled visitors.No update on Johnson's health has so far been issued Monday, but his spokesman said he is not immediately returning to work, on the advice of his medical team.Johnson spoke to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is still deputizing for the Prime Minister, over the weekend but is focusing on recovery and has not received a \"red box\" -- cases containing briefing papers given to ministers -- since his condition worsened on April 6, his spokesperson said.CNN's Simon Cullen and Luke McGee contributed reporting.",

His wife, Susie Moss, told PA that he \"died peacefully at his London home following a long illness.\"\"It was one lap too many,\" she said. \"He just closed his eyes.\"Moss was an active race driver between 1948 and 1962, competing in numerous classifications and winning 212 of the 529 races he competed in, famously including the 1955 Mille Miglia, a 1,000 mile (1,600km) race across Italy, in record time.Stirling Moss competed in motoring festivals into his 80s.He was also the F1 Driver's Championship runner-up on four occasions over the course of his career.Read MoreMoss won 16 Grands Prix during his career, including \"iconic\" victories in Monaco and Germany in 1961, according to F1.\"Moss contested 66 Grands Prix from 1951 to 1961, driving for the likes of Vanwall, Maserati and Mercedes, where he famously formed a contented and ruthlessly effective partnership with lead driver Juan Manuel Fangio,\" said F1 in a statement. \"All at F1 send our heartfelt condolences to Lady Susie and Sir Stirling's family and friends.\"Mercedes, one of Moss's former teams, said in a tweet on Sunday: \"Today, the sporting world lost not only a true icon and a legend, but a gentleman. The Team and the Mercedes Motorsport family have lost a dear friend. Sir Stirling, we'll miss you.\"It was on joining the all-conquering Mercedes team, led by Fangio, that his first F1 world championship success came, winning the 1955 British Grand Prix, beating the legendary Argentine into second place.Stirling Moss lifts the trophy at the British Grand Prix in 1955.Moss finished runner-up in the championship to Fangio that year and twice more subsequently, but it was in 1958 that he came closest to claiming the F1 world title.He lost out to Mike Hawthorn by a single point, but at the Portuguese Grand Prix he helped get his British rival reinstated after he had been disqualified following a spin, sparing him a six-point penalty.\"I had no hesitation in doing it,\" Moss recalled many years later. \"I can't see how this is open to debate. The fact that he was my only rival in the championship didn't come into my thinking. Absolutely not.\"READ: Motoring great Stirling Moss hospitalized in SingaporeIt was an incredible act of sportsmanship and helped cement his popularity among the British public, who admired his flamboyant style and never-say-die attitude.Moss's career officially ended after an horrific crash at the Goodwood circuit in southern England on Easter Monday 1962 when he had to be cut out of his car and suffered life-threatening injuries.It was a month before he was fully conscious and he reluctantly called time on full-time competition at the age of 32 because of the extent of his injuries.Although he had retired, he was forever associated with fast driving and the rhetorical phrase \"Who do you think you are, Stirling Moss?\" was supposedly the standard question all British policemen asked speeding motorists.Stirling Moss and 2009 F1 world champion Jenson Button were the centre of media attention at the Goodwood Festival in 2015.

But anecdotal accounts, research and reports of frontline worker deaths in the UK suggest that assertion could be off the mark.Across the nation, tributes have been flooding in for health workers who reportedly died from coronavirus-related complications. Some of them came from minority black or Asian communities, according to media reports.On Saturday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock addressed the fact that a number of health workers who have died from coronavirus were from \"minority ethnic backgrounds,\" saying on BBC Breakfast he found it \"really upsetting.\" In an interview with the British daily The Guardian, the head of the the doctors' union, the British Medical Association (BMA), called for a government investigation into whether minorities were more vulnerable to Covid-19.\"At face value, it seems hard to see how this can be random,\" Dr. Chaand Nagpaul said in reference to the first 10 doctors in the UK to be named as having died from coronavirus-related symptoms coming from minority backgrounds, according to The Guardian.

This has to be addressed -- the government must act now,\" he told The Guardian. Covid-19 has ripped through families and grounded the UK economy, and questions are mounting in the British media as to whether it is having a disproportionate effect on minority groups in Britain. But unlike the US -- where data released by Chicago and Michigan authorities showed a clear racial disparity in coronavirus victims -- the picture is not that clear in the UK. Experts say there are many unknowns: mainly that British health authorities are not reporting race in statistics on confirmed cases or fatalities.On Friday, the UK had the fourth-highest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world.This public data deficit has not only left communities in the dark, it has failed to highlight the structural inequalities or health factors that might be at play behind the mounting deaths: be it geography, poverty or genetic disposition.\"The UK ought to be good at collecting data,\" Sunder Katwala, the director of British Future, a think tank that focuses on identity, told CNN. Experts say Britain has a strong tradition of research on the social determinants of health and health inequalities, and is among the few countries in Europe that collects race data.But officials dropped the ball in making that information public, Katwala said. \"I think with the sheer pressure of this crisis -- of realizing how big it is and the economic impacts -- it feels like policymakers have been slightly slow to work on this dimension.\" The National Health Service (NHS) has been collating race and socio-economic information from Covid-19 cases, Sarah MacLennan, NHS England spokesperson told CNN. Data teams will then look at how \"socio-economic aspects and housing conditions\" affect the spread of the virus, she said. No timeline was provided on when those data points would be released to the public. On Friday, the UK had the fifth highest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world, with 8,958 fatalities and 74,605 confirmed cases, according to Johns Hopkins University figures.First signs Early research this month by Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC), into confirmed Covid-19 cases admitted to critical care units in England, Wales and Northern Ireland,  indicates that ethnic minorities may be over-represented when compared to the general population. The data is not from all critical care units in those regions.  Figures released on April 10 found that as many as a third of 3,370 coronavirus patients receiving critical care came from Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) backgrounds -- nearly three times the 13% proportion of ethnic minorities in the UK population, according to the 2011 census.The virus has been hitting urban centers the hardest, where most of the critical care data has been coming from. In England, Sheffield has the highest number of confirmed cases per 100,000 of the population, followed by London, Liverpool and Birmingham, according to Public Health England data analyzed by urban policy charity The Centre for Cities. The nurses risking it all on the frontline of Britain's coronavirus outbreakThese are cities that have large minority populations, suggesting that geography has left minorities even more exposed. Studies show these communities, particularly people of Asian backgrounds, \"have higher rates of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and high blood pressure, which has been shown in China and Italy [Covid-19 cases] to be associated with more severe disease,\" University of Leicester professor Kamlesh Khunti told CNN.Black people of West African descent also have an increased risk of strokes and hypertension, conditions that can exacerbate coronavirus symptoms, compared to the general population, according to Keith Neal, emeritus professor of the Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases at the University of Nottingham.Britain's ethnic minority population is in general younger than Britain's white population, according to a report by the Centre for Policy on Ageing.Knowing that the virus typically affects older people more seriously, comparing ICNARC's findings to the over-65 population of each minority group could make \"that figure [of disproportionality] even worse,\" Neal added.

The amount of physical, mental, and emotional pain I am in when I think about never seeing, touching, or holding you again is unbearable.

        "content": "(CNN)Much of Europe is still on coronavirus lockdown, with severe restrictions on movement and penalties for those who transgress.But not Sweden. Restaurants and bars are open in the Nordic country, playgrounds and schools too, and the government is relying on voluntary action to stem the spread of Covid-19.It's a controversial approach, and one that's drawn US President Donald Trump's attention. \"Sweden did that, the herd, they call it the herd. Sweden's suffering very, very badly,\" Trump said on Tuesday.  Lockdowns shouldn't be fully lifted until coronavirus vaccine found, new study warnsBut the Swedish government is confident its policy can work. Foreign Minister Ann Linde told Swedish TV on Wednesday that Trump was \"factually wrong\" to suggest that Sweden was following the \"herd immunity\" theory -- of letting enough people catch the virus while protecting the vulnerable, meaning a country's population builds up immunity against the disease.  Sweden's strategy, she said, was: \"No lockdown and we rely very much on people taking responsibility themselves.\"Read MoreThe country's state epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, also pushed back against Trump's criticism that Sweden was doing badly. \"I think Sweden is doing okay,\" he told CNN affiliate Expressen. \"It's producing quality results the same way it's always done. So far Swedish health care is handling this pandemic in a fantastic way.\"As of April 9, Sweden has 9,141 cases of the Covid-19 virus and 793 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. Swedish authorities have allowed a large amount of personal freedom unlike other European countries.Sweden's actions are about encouraging and recommending, not compulsion. Two days after Spain imposed a nationwide lockdown on March 14, Swedish authorities were encouraging people to wash hands and stay at home if sick. On March 24, new rules were introduced to avoid crowding at restaurants. But they very much stayed open.  So did many primary and secondary schools. Gatherings of up to 50 people are still permitted.Tegnell defended the decision to keep schools open. \"We know that closing down schools has a lot of effects on health care because a lot of people can't go to their work anymore. A lot of children are suffering when they can't go to school.\"Elisabeth Liden, a journalist in Stockholm, told CNN the city is less crowded now. \"The subway went from being completely packed to having only a few passengers per car. I get the sense that a vast majority are taking the recommendations of social distancing seriously.\"But she added that while \"some Swedes won\u00b4t even kiss their spouse, others are throwing Easter parties.\"Fresh surgeMuch of Sweden's focus has been to protect the elderly. Anyone aged 70 or older has been told to stay at home and limit their social contact as much as possible. One Swedish government official said that on the whole people supported the government's approach, but many were \"upset about the fact that no ban on visiting homes for elderly was set until recently [April 1], and now the virus is widely spread among these homes, causing the death toll to rise.\"The World Health Organization (WHO) is skeptical of Sweden's approach. Noting a fresh surge in the country's infections, the WHO told CNN Wednesday that it's \"imperative\" that Sweden \"increase measures to control spread of the virus, prepare and increase capacity of the health system to cope, ensure physical distancing and communicate the why and how of all measures to the population.\"Swedish restaurants have very much remained open. \"Only an 'all of society' approach will work to prevent escalation and turn this situation around,\" said a WHO Europe spokesperson.Sweden's \"curve\" -- the rate of infections and deaths caused by coronavirus -- is certainly steeper than that of many other European countries with stricter measures. A study by Imperial College London estimated that 3.1% of the Swedish population was infected (as of March 28) -- compared to 0.41% in Norway and 2.5% in the UK. As for deaths, by April 8, coronavirus accounted for 67 fatalities per 1 million Swedish citizens, according to the Swedish Health Ministry. Norway had 19 deaths per million, Finland seven per million. The number of deaths rose 16% on Wednesday.Some Swedish researchers are demanding the government must be stricter. This week several prominent Swedish clinicians wrote an open letter lamenting that large numbers of people are visiting bars, restaurants and shopping malls, even ski slopes. \"This unfortunately is translating into a death toll that continues to climb in Sweden.\"How do you reopen the economy after coronavirus? German experts have a planCecilia S\u00f6derberg-Naucl\u00e9r -- a virus immunology researcher at Sweden's Karolinska Institute -- is one of more than 2,000 health professionals and researchers who signed a petition demanding tougher action. She told CNN: \"We are not winning this battle. It is horrifying.\"Where I live people are working from home, but they go to local restaurants, local caf\u00e9s and they mix up old people and young people from schools and universities. That is not social distancing.\"S\u00f6derberg-Naucl\u00e9r says the situation in Stockholm, where the great majority of the country's infections have occurred, is \"lost,\" but adds: \"It is not too late for rest of the country. I wish we would lock down and take control of regions not affected in same way.\"Weather the stormTom Britton, professor of mathematical statistics at Stockholm University, models how infectious diseases behave in a population. He believes 40% of the Swedish capital's population will be infected by the end of April. While acknowledging the difficulty of measuring the rate of infection, he told CNN that \"my best guess today would be 10% or a bit more\" of Swedes currently have the virus nationwide.Some opponents of the government's policy fear that reliance on voluntary behavior will cause a much faster spike in cases, potentially overwhelming the health care system. Sweden also has one of the lowest ratios of critical care beds per capita in Europe, and the government official who spoke with CNN said that supplies of protective equipment are only just staying ahead of demand.Iceland lab's testing suggests 50% of coronavirus cases have no symptomsIn some ways, however, Sweden is better prepared to weather the storm than other countries. Some 40% of the country's workforce worked from home regularly, even before the virus struck and Sweden has a high ratio of people living on their own, whereas in southern Europe it's not uncommon to have three generations under one roof.Emma Grossmith, a British employment lawyer working in Stockholm, says another factor in Sweden's favor is a generous social welfare net that means people don't feel obligated to turn up for work if their young child is sick. State support kicks in on day one of absence from work due to a child being sick. \"The system here was already well set up to help people to make smarter choices which ultimately benefit the wider population,\" she told CNN.Read more:Adjusted model predicts fewer people in US will need hospitals, but 82,000 will still die by AugustUS, UK coronavirus strategies shifted following UK epidemiologists' ominous reportThe UK's 'coronavirus dashboard' may be under-reporting deaths significantlyBut Grossmith notes a big gap between the way Swedes and expatriates view the virus. \"There is a native trust in the system amongst those who have grown up with it. In contrast, many of the expat community feel that the strategy has neither been communicated clearly nor robustly challenged in the Swedish press. They are deeply worried.\"The next month will determine whether the Swedish system got it right.An earlier version of this story included an inaccurate statement about Sweden's welfare system.

Crew of prehistoric monkeys rafted across the Atlantic to South AmericaA team of experts from the Universities of Exeter, Leicester and Oxford in the UK found through radiocarbon dating that these animals -- long associated with Easter -- reached the UK between the fifth and third centuries BC.However, it is thought that they were not used for food until hundreds of years later, after the Romans conquered Britain.Read MoreCiting the discovery of carefully buried skeletons \"with no signs of butchery,\" the researchers say the archaeological evidence shows that hares and chickens were initially not consumed.  These new findings corroborate a passage written by Julius Caesar more than 2,000 years ago in his book \"De Bello Gallico,\" in which he says: \"The Britons consider it contrary to divine law to eat the hare, the chicken, or the goose. They raise these, however, for their own amusement and pleasure.\"A street food vendor's tip led archaeologists to find an ancient Maya capital in a cattle rancher's yardThe research team suggests that hares were associated with an unknown hare goddess and chickens with an Iron Age god similar to Mercury, the Roman messenger god. Professor Naomi Sykes, an archaeologist at the University of Exeter and the lead researcher on the project, told CNN: \"When new animals arrive into a culture, they are often linked with deities.\"She said that horses, which were introduced to Britain slightly before chickens and hares, also had a \"special status,\" although they were \"occasionally eaten.\" Although their religious associations lasted through the Roman era, Sykes said: \"They were increasingly eaten, and hares were even farmed as livestock. Rather than being buried as individuals, hare and chicken remains were then disposed of as food waste.\"New Zealand PM adds 2 crucial figures to list of essential workers: The Tooth Fairy and Easter Bunny After Roman rule collapsed in 410 AD in Britain, the populations of these animals declined heavily and they are thought to have regained their special status because of their scarcity. The research team is now working to track how chickens, which are native to southeast Asia, came to Britain. Brown hares' origins remain unknown, according to Sykes.",

Who now speaks of the fires in Australia, or remembers that 18 months ago a boat could cross the North Pole because the glaciers had all melted?

He is being distanced from anyone who might be carrying the virus, takes his meals in his private quarters, and uses hand sanitizer before and after meeting any guests, the Vatican press office said.Pope Francis also said in the interview he was recovering from his bronchitis and praying even more from his residence in the Vatican during this \"time of great uncertainty.\"Pope Francis presides over a moment of prayer on the sagrato of St Peters Basilica on March 27.Francis also revealed he goes to confession every Tuesday to ask forgiveness for his own selfishness. \"I take care of things there,\" he said.He also criticized the response to the outbreak, saying the homeless should be quarantined in hotels and not in parking lots.\"A photo appeared the other day of a parking lot in Las Vegas where they [the homeless] had been put in quarantine. And the hotels were empty. But the homeless cannot go to a hotel,\" the Pope said.Quarantine life is starting to feel like a real Lent\"This is the moment to see the poor,\" he said, adding that society often treats those in need as \"rescued animals.\"The Pope also warned against the rise of populist politicians -- who he said are giving speeches reminiscent of Hitler in 1933 -- and others who are focusing solely on the economy. He said he was worried by the \"hypocrisy of certain political personalities who speak of facing up to the crisis, of the problem of hunger in the world, but who in the meantime manufacture weapons.\"The Pope encouraged those in a lockdown to find creative ways of being at home. \"Take care of yourselves for a future that will come,\" Francis said.",

        "content": "(CNN)The 2020 Formula One season could be a \"closed event\" when it does restart, according to the sports' managing director Ross Brawn. The coronavirus pandemic has caused the start of the season to be delayed, and on Tuesday, the Canadian Grand Prix became the ninth race to be either postponed or canceled.The French Grand Prix, currently scheduled for June 28, is the first meeting that has yet to be postponed, but Brawn thinks a July start date is more feasible and it could be \"self-contained,\" without fans in attendance. \"Travel for the teams and travel for everyone involved is going to be one of the big issues,\" said Brawn, speaking to Sky Sports. \"You could argue once we get there we could become fairly self-contained.READ: Formula One goes virtual as Bahrain Grand Prix kicks off the seasonRead MoreBrawn chats with Red Bull Racing Team Principal Christian Horner.\"Our view is probably a European start will be favorable and that could even be a closed event. We could have a very enclosed environment, where teams come in on charters, we channel them into the circuit, we make sure everyone is tested, cleared and that there is no risk to anyone.\"We have a race with no spectators. That's not great, but it's better than no racing at all. We have to remember there are millions of people who follow the sport sat at home. A lot of them are isolating and to be able to keep the sport alive and put on a sport and entertain people would be a huge bonus in this crisis we have.\"The news of the Canadian GP's postponement follows the announcement that F1 are working with promoters on a revised 2020 calendar.F1 CEO Chase Carey told fans that the updated calendar would look very different to the original, with the actual sequence and schedule dates for races likely to differ significantly.According to the sports' governing body -- F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile -- statutes, the driving series would need to complete eight races for the 2020 championship to be valid.READ: Lewis Hamilton is 'well' following isolation after he was pictured with Idris Elba, who tested positive for coronavirusFans queue up outside the gates prior to the first practice session for the Formula One Australian Grand Prix.Brawn believes that completing a \"18-19 race season\" is possible -- which would mean losing three races from the original 22-race schedule -- even if that means extending the season into 2021.  \"We could achieve eight races by starting in October,\" the former team principal said. \"But then there is always the possibility we could run into next year. \"That's being explored. Can we stray into January to finish the season? There are all sorts of complications, as you can imagine, with that. \"If we were able to start at the beginning of July we could do a 19-race season. (It would be) tough -- three races on, one weekend off, three races on, one weekend off.\"Brawn's comments come a day after Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto said F1 needs to be \"flexible\" to fit as many races into the 2020 calendar. Binotto looks on in the garage during final practice for the F1 Grand Prix of USA.More intense grand prix weekends have been mooted, with the possibility of having races on both the Saturday and Sunday suggested. \"I think what will be important for us is really to be flexible,\" Binotto told Sky Sports. \"I'm pretty sure Chase (Carey) and the teams will be capable of putting together the best championship we can have. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos\"From our side, we are ready for whatever is needed whether short race weekends, double races, whenever it will finish or packing the races together. It is important to be flexible and making sure we can have good races as well for the fans.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Australian police boarded the Ruby Princess cruise ship Wednesday night to gather evidence for an investigation into how thousands of passengers were allowed to disembark in Sydney last month resulting in a spike of coronavirus cases.Over 600 cases and 15 deaths have been linked to the ship, according to public broadcaster ABC. Last week, police launched a probe into just why the Ruby Princess was allowed to dock in Sydney, dropping off 2,600 passengers, despite widespread concerns over coronavirus and multiple previous outbreaks elsewhere in the world involving cruise ship.New South Wales police commissioner Mick Fuller said Wednesday that the ship's captain was \"extremely helpful,\" and that the black box, a recorder similar to that found on airplanes, was recovered along with other evidence. Officers went on the ship under the powers of the NSW coroner who has started a preliminary investigation. Read MoreIt is expected that the investigation will involve interviewing thousands of witnesses, including the ship's captain, doctors, crew members, and passengers, and officials from the federal and state government.\"After reviewing the information at hand, the only way I can determine whether our national biosecurity laws or our state laws were broken is through a criminal investigation,\" Fuller said last week. That investigation is running alongside the probe being conducted under the auspices of the coroner's office. Fuller said Wednesday police were waiting for a human health report before deciding next steps and that report would be central to the investigation. He could not give a time frame for the investigation.More than 1,000 crew members remain on the ship and Fuller says 75% have said they'd like to remain on the ship.Late last month, Australian authorities publicly requested that all passengers who disembarked the ship self-quarantine, as they may have been exposed to the virus while on board. The coronavirus pandemic has been devastating for the cruise industry, with outbreaks onboard vessels in the US, Japan and South America. While operators have halted most of the global fleet, more than a dozen cruise ships have been effectively trapped at sea, as countries refused to allow those carrying infected passengers to dock.Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said this month it was in direct contact with 10 cruise ships with around 600 Australian passengers on board.\"In most cases, disembarkation cannot occur unless passengers have onward flight arrangements and are able to travel directly to the airport via a so-called sanitary corridor, put in place by host countries,\" DFAT said in a statement.On Thursday, Australian and New Zealand passengers on board a cruise ship stuck off the coast of Uruguay began being evacuated back to Australia. European and US passengers on the vessel, where 60% of passengers have tested positive for coronavirus, are still awaiting arrangements to take them home.

He has not required invasive or non-invasive ventilation and does not have pneumonia.But the seriousness of the Prime Minister's condition at a time of national emergency, combined with the lack of a formal succession procedure for heads of government in the UK, has raised questions about who is leading the country. Johnson has nominated his Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, to deputize for him \"as necessary\" but there is no recent precedent for a sitting UK prime minister becoming incapacitated for a lengthy period.In its daily update to reporters, Downing Street moved to head off concerns, stressing that Raab was running the country from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office with the support of government officials.Read MoreRaab would chair meetings of the National Security Council if any were needed while he was deputizing for the Prime Minister, a spokesperson said. Raab, 46, and the UK's Cabinet have the authority and ability to respond in the PM's absence on military action, the spokesperson added.British police officers stand on duty outside St Thomas' Hospital in central London, where Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson is in intensive care on April 7, 2020. Decisions relating to Covid-19 would be taken in the usual way through the daily morning meeting, chaired by Raab, and other ministerial groupings. But Raab would not have the power to hire and fire ministers or officials, the spokesperson said.The UK lockdown will remain in place with the government \"focused on stopping the spread of the infection.\" The spokesperson said that if there were evidence that more needed to be done to slow the rate of transmission, \"we would be prepared to do that.\"Who is running the UK?Few formal powers are invested specifically in the UK prime minister and key decisions are taken collectively by the Cabinet or its sub-committees. Many statutory powers are held by individual secretaries of state. But in recent decades, holders of the UK's top political office have adopted a more presidential style, and the sweeping nature of the ruling Conservative Party's most recent election victory was attributed to Johnson's personal appeal with voters.

He sidestepped a question about who would take decisions in the event of a nuclear attack, saying he would not discuss national security issues.Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the House of Commons defense select committee, tweeted good wishes to Johnson but added: \"It is important to have 100% clarity as to where responsibility for UK national security decisions now lies. We must anticipate adversaries attempting to exploit any perceived weakness.\"Buckingham Palace and the Queen have been regularly updated on Johnson's condition, Downing Street said. The Prime Minister's two most senior officials, the cabinet secretary and his principal private secretary, will maintain contact with the palace on the Prime Minister's behalf, but the weekly audiences with the Queen will not continue for the time being.The Queen has sent a message to Johnson's pregnant fianc\u00e9e Carrie Symonds and the Johnson family. \"Her Majesty said they were in her thoughts and that she wished the Prime Minister a full and speedy recovery,\" Buckingham Palace said.The Duke of Cambridge also sent his best wishes. \"Our thoughts are with the Prime Minister and his family, who like so many in the UK and around the world are affected by coronavirus,\" said Prince William.A woman with a sign of support on her bicycle in London as leaders from across the world expressed their hope that Johnson would make a rapid recovery.Johnson's spokesperson said that despite the lack of a formal succession procedure in the UK, there was an established order of ministerial precedence, with the top finance minister, Rishi Sunak following Raab. The \"letters of last resort,\" sealed documents written by the Prime Minister to ballistic missile submarine commanders in case of a nuclear attack, still stand. \"The Prime Minister remains the Prime Minister,\" the spokesperson said. US President Donald Trump said at a Monday news conference that his administration had been in contact with Johnson's doctors. The Prime Minister's spokesperson said the government was \"grateful for all of the warm wishes the PM has received overnight\" and \"confident he is receiving the best care from the NHS. Any treatment he receives is a matter for his doctors.\"Related storiesWho is Raab, the man deputizing for Johnson?Dr. Gupta on what this means for PMTrack the spread of the coronavirusLive updates on the coronavirusGove told BBC Radio 4's Today program earlier that Johnson was \"receiving the very best care\" at St. Thomas' Hospital in London, after being taken into intensive care at 7 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET) on Monday. Gove later said that he was self-isolating at home because a member of his family was displaying coronavirus symptoms. Gove said on Twitter that he did not have any symptoms and was continuing to work. The coronavirus has hit the top of the British government hard. The Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, said on March 27 that he had the virus, on the same day that the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, announced that he would begin self-isolation after displaying Covid-19 symptoms. Neil Ferguson, a top UK government adviser on the virus, said on March 18 he believed he had been infected.  Various other senior government ministers and advisers have been forced to self-isolate. Dominic Cummings, the Prime Minister's senior adviser, who self-isolated soon after Johnson's diagnosis, has not yet returned to work, Downing Street said.Who is Dominic Raab? The Brexiteer ex-lawyer deputizing for Boris JohnsonJohnson was taken to hospital on Sunday evening. At the time, Downing Street said the decision was a precaution because he continued to suffer from a cough and a fever ten days after testing positive for the coronavirus. But his condition deteriorated on Monday, Downing Street said, and he was moved to the intensive care unit at St. Thomas' Hospital.Gove told Sky News on Tuesday morning that Cabinet ministers were not told about the Prime Minister's deteriorating condition until nearly an hour after Johnson was taken into intensive care.Asked whether the government had been up front with the public about Johnson's condition, and whether the Cabinet had been taken by surprise, he replied: \"Yes we were. The [daily coronavirus] briefing that was given at 5 o'clock was given at a time when we didn't know about the deterioration in the Prime Minister's condition.\"\"We were informed subsequently. The Prime Minister was admitted to intensive care at 7 o'clock, and that information wasn't given to us in government -- to those in the cabinet -- until just before 8 o'clock.\"Words of supportPoliticians around the world sent best wishes for the Prime Minister's recovery. Finance minister Sunak said on Twitter that his thoughts were with Johnson and his fianc\u00e9e, Symonds. \"I know he'll be getting the best care possible and will come out of this even stronger,\" he said. Symonds has also experienced Covid-19 symptoms but said over the weekend she was \"on the mend.\"The Speaker of the UK's House of Commons, Lindsay Hoyle, said: \"I know the thoughts and prayers of everyone across the House are with the Prime Minister and his family right now.

        "content": "(CNN)Former Brazilian soccer star Ronaldinho has been granted house arrest in Paraguay after allegedly entering the country with false documents.Along with his brother Robert, the former Barcelona forward was arrested by Paraguay's national police on March 4. The prosecutor's office said that officials found various documents, including ID cards and Paraguayan passports in the men's names.Both men, who were being held in a prison in Asunci\u00f3n, appeared in court via a video conference on Tuesday.

Both men will remain in a hotel in the Paraguayan capital while they continue to be investigated. The sentencing was broadcast live by Paraguayan news outlets. Authorities claimed that Ronaldo de Assis Moreira, also known as \"Ronaldinho,\" was using authentic passports containing false content. Documents were found during a search of the sports star's suite at the Yacht Resort Hotel and Golf Club in Lambar\u00e9, near the Paraguayan capital city of Asunci\u00f3n, prosecutors said in a statement published on Facebook.Authorities said that in order to have a Paraguayan passport, a person must live for a certain amount of time in the country.Ronaldinho and his brother Roberto (right) arrive at Asuncion's Justice Palace to appear before a public prosecutor.\"Ronaldinho and his brother entered the country at 9.05 a.m. on a commercial flight which landed at Silvio Petirossi International Airport. They entered using a Paraguayan passport which was authentic but contained false information,\" public prosecutor Federico Delfino said in a Facebook post at the time.\"We now know that the numbers of these passports belong to other people. They are real passports but with fake details. They were issued in January 2020, and the ID cards, which were given to them when they arrived, in December.\"Paraguayan authorities believed that their Brazilian counterparts had previously taken away the brother's Brazilian passports due to financial issues -- however, they were told that in fact the documents were returned to them in October 2019.Paraguayan Attorney General's Office told CNNE that Brazilian counterparts said both men departed their country with real Brazilian passports.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosRonaldinho made club 529 appearances over his 17-year playing career, turning out for a host of top European football clubs, including Barcelona, AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain.

While it does not mention migrants specifically, the order refers to search and rescue operations, which pluck thousands of migrants from the Mediterranean each year.It will remain in place for the duration of the health emergency triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, the decree added. The measure was condemned by several non-governmental organizations (NGOs), including Sea Watch, MSF and Open Arms, in a joint statement. Read MoreThe statement said Italy should \"show the same solidarity towards vulnerable people who risk their lives at sea because they have no alternative\" at a time when the country is seeking international help to deal with the pandemic.Abortion provision thrown into doubt by coronavirus pandemic\"With a decree whose obvious purpose is to stop rescue activities in the Mediterranean, without providing alternatives to save the lives of those fleeing Libya, Italy has deprived its ports of the connotation of 'safe places,'\" the joint statement read.None of the NGO signatories currently have rescue ships at sea, according to their statement. But the decree comes as the German-flagged vessel Alan Kurdi, operated by Sea-Eye, is currently in international waters off the coast of Libya with 150 shipwreck survivors on board, including a pregnant woman, according to their press release.The Italian Ministry of Transport has asked the German government to \"take responsibility\" for the landing port for the Alan Kurdi vessel, it said in a statement.Italy has been one of the worst-hit European countries in the pandemic. According to John Hopkins University, the country has 139,422 confirmed cases and 17,669 deaths as of Wednesday. In 2018, the far-right former Interior Minister Matteo Salvini closed Italy's ports to migrant rescue vessels. And in 2019, Italy adopted a decree that could see ships docking without authorization facing fines of up to $57,000.",

We will keep all of our focus and all of our resolve, with calm determination on delivering the government's plan to defeat the coronavirus.\"The Prime Minister was taken to hospital on Sunday evening. At the time, Downing Street said the decision was a precaution because he continued to suffer from a cough and a fever ten days after testing positive for the coronavirus. But his condition deteriorated on Monday, Downing Street said, and he was moved to the intensive care unit at St. Thomas' Hospital, close to the Houses of Parliament.Related storiesUK 'dashboard' may be underreporting deathsChaos rocks White House on most tragic dayTrack the spread of the coronavirusLive updates on the coronavirusThe seriousness of the Prime Minister's condition at a time of national emergency, combined with the lack of a formal succession procedure for heads of government in the UK, has raised questions about who is leading the country.Few formal powers are invested specifically in the PM, and key decisions are taken collectively by the cabinet or its sub-committees. Many statutory powers are held by individual secretaries of state. But in recent decades, holders of the UK's top political office have adopted a more presidential style, and the sweeping nature of the ruling Conservative Party's most recent election victory was attributed to Johnson's personal appeal with voters.There is no recent precedent for a sitting UK prime minister becoming incapacitated for a lengthy period. Decisions relating to Covid-19 will be taken in the usual way through the daily morning meeting, chaired by Raab, and other ministerial groupings. Raab will not have powers to hire and fire ministers and Johnson's weekly audiences with the Queen will not take place for the time being.Leaders from around the world, including President Donald Trump, have expressed their concern for the UK PM and hopes for his rapid recovery CNN's Luke McGee and Angela Dewan contributed to this report.",

After patient evaluations at UCL Hospital and other London area hospitals, the device received regulatory approval last week. An order for up to 10,000 devices has been placed by the British National Health Service (NHS). Mercedes' facility in Brixworth, England -- where the F1 engines are designed and developed -- has been repurposed to meet that demand and is expected to produce 1,000 units per day.The new device was reverse-engineered from a previous model in less than 100 hours and received regulatory approval last week, a UCL statetment said. The revised design consumes 70% less oxygen than the earlier model.Read MoreA volunteer 'patient' with the newly developed CPAP device\"These life-saving devices will provide vital support to the NHS in coming weeks, helping to keep patients off ventilators and reducing demand on intensive care beds and staff,\" said Professor David Lomas, UCL's vice-provost. \"It is a phenomenal achievement that they are arriving at hospitals only two weeks after the first prototype was built. It shows what can be done when universities, hospitals and industry work together for the national good.\"CPAP machines help to keep patients' airways open and increase the amount of oxygen entering the lungs by pushing air and oxygen into the mouth and nose at a continuous rate.
