        "content": "Martin County, Florida (CNN)Since many Florida public schools opened their doors about a month ago, the number of children under 18 who have contracted Covid-19 statewide has jumped 26%, state data show.Gov. Ron DeSantis continues to push for in-person instruction across the Sunshine State. Even though his administration has released county-level data that indicates the 26% jump, it has not released school-level Covid-19 data for all K-12 public schools, which CNN began asking the state Department of Health for on August 31. On September 2 -- nearly two weeks ago -- state officials said by email the data would be released in the coming days and weeks.But still, the state hasn't provided this key information. A classroom at Jensen Beach Elementary School. Administrators say parents were warned social distancing would not be possible at all times.To deal with this information gap, some school districts have created their own Covid-19 data dashboards or released coronavirus case numbers on social media pages or their websites. While useful in those jurisdictions, the overall result is a patchwork of data that varies in completeness and timeliness by district at a time when students, parents, teachers and administrators are making tough decisions about whether to opt for virtual or in-person learning. It's a problem that reverberates across the US as the White House and federal agencies come down hard in favor of reopening schools but often fail to give reliable information to those on the front lines.Read MoreOn campus, 'people were breaking the rules'Florida began reopening schools August 10. On that day, 42,761 children under 18 statewide were infected with the coronavirus, the state Department of Health reported.A 6-year-old girl is the youngest person to die of Covid-19 in Florida, state saysThat week, nine of 12 school districts opening their doors were in counties with positivity rates above 5%, the uppermost threshold recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for schools to offer in-person learning. CNN confirmed the list of districts that planned to open as provided by an attorney for the Florida Education Association and confirmed positivity rates with the Florida Department of Health. One month later, 53,717 Florida children have tested positive for Covid-19, with a positivity rate of 14.3%, statewide data show.In Martin County, the positivity rate among children tested is 20.5%, according to the latest state data.Reese Richardson started seventh grade in person on August 11 at a Martin County public school. But after about a week and a half, she decided to switch to virtual learning.\"Kids were taking off their masks,\" Reese said. \"They were touching. They were close in the halls. People were breaking the rules.\"Reese Richardson stopped going to in-person school and is now learning from home.The Martin County School District is one of those districts that releases its own Covid-19 data via the news media. One day after reopening, an entire classroom was placed under quarantine. A month later, it has reported 23 positive or presumed positive cases and has quarantined 510 students. The district has 16,500 K-12 students.Lindsey Tarpley appreciates the transparency from the district, she said. She works for the Martin County School District, and her children, ages 10 and 5, attend Jensen Beach Elementary School in the county. \"I use that information to make a decision for them to attend school,\" Tarpley said.But Jill Richardson, Reese's mom and a former teacher, wants more transparency from the district and the state.\"I don't feel like I'm getting up-to-date or accurate numbers,\" Richardson said.The Richardson family decided to allow their children to start school in person. They transitioned to remote learning about a week and a half into the school year.District-level data varies in detail At least 1.1 million students were participating on August 31 in in-person instruction, the state Department of Education tweeted that day. But the data available to students and parents about the Covid-19 situation in their schools still varies from district to district.   Two Florida teachers turned their students' desks into little Jeeps to make social distancing less scaryHillsborough County Public Schools launched a dashboard that shows 255 positive cases in students and employees since July 31. The Osceola School District posts on its website the number of students and personnel who are either quarantined or have tested positive for a given week. Orange County Public Schools releases its Covid-19 data on Facebook on Tuesdays and Fridays. The latest post cites 18 new positive cases in 17 schools since the last report and lists 61 schools that \"have had a positive case associated with an individual who has been on campus since the start of face-to-face classes on August 21.\"Depending on how data are tracked and displayed, this piecemeal approach can make it hard to keep tabs on new cases and may not specify the schools, grades or classrooms where infected students have been.Florida's largest teacher's union in a new TV commercial is pushing the state to release comprehensive data.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks during a July news briefing.\"As the virus spreads, those at the top aren't giving us the information we need,\" the narrator says in the ad. \"Instead, Gov. DeSantis plays politics with our kids' health.\"\"When we deny what's going on in the schools, ... when we deny that information, it just causes the spread to grow much faster,\" said Andrew Spar, Florida Education Association president.On why his administration has not released school-specific Covid-19 data, DeSantis had this to say during a September 11 news conference. \"It's not like if a test is reported to the state that the state necessarily knows which school that came from. That's not the way it's going,\" he said in response to a question from CNN.  DeSantis has asked his commissioner of education and state surgeon general to produce the information, he said. But a date for the release of the data has not been provided.Students' mental health is also a factorThe state does not require Martin County public schools to report the number of students and staff who are quarantined or have tested positive, Superintendent Laurie Gaylord told CNN.Students quarantined in Martin County stay home. In some cases, a teacher -- considered an essential worker -- with the same coronavirus exposure is required to report to work for in-person instruction the next day.Even with all these challenges, many parents and teachers in Florida are comfortable with brick-and-mortar schooling. In Martin County public schools, 64% of students are attending in-person classes, and 36% are learning remotely.Dining tables at Jensen Beach Elementary School in Martin County are labeled with numbers and Disney characters to encourage social distancing.At Jensen Beach Elementary School in Martin County, the halls are marked to facilitate social distancing. The dining hall is disinfected after every use. But desks in some classrooms are not 6 feet apart. Parents were warned social distancing would not be possible at all times, Gaylord said, so masks are required to be worn in schools.Tarpley, the Martin schools mom and employee, trusts the district is doing everything it can to keep her children safe, she said. And she believes there is no substitute for being in a classroom in terms of the mental health and well-being of her children.\"With everything in life,\" she said, \"there is a risk.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Six years after a Black teenager was shot and killed by Chicago police, one of the officers involved could lose his badge.Chicago's Civilian Office of Police Accountability (COPA) is recommending that Officer Saharat Sampim be \"separated\" from the Chicago Police Department for providing \"false statements\" in the officer-involved shooting death of Roshad McIntosh.\"COPA investigators concluded that Officer Sampim knowingly provided false statements that could not be reasonably attributed to a mistake of perception, timing, or memory and recommended separation from the Department,\" COPA said in a statement.Sampim's attorney Tim Grace told CNN by phone that he believes \"it is premature to take the position that Officer Sampim was not truthful,\" and he looks forward to litigating the case.Roshad McIntosh liked playing basketball and making people laugh, his mother Cynthia Lane said.McIntosh was 19 years old when he was shot and killed by another Chicago police officer in August 2014.Read MoreCNN followed McIntosh's mother, Cynthia Lane, as she sought answers about her son's death. The three-episode CNN digital documentary titled \"Beneath The Skin\" raised questions about the original police investigation into the shooting. The investigation by Chicago's Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA), which is now called COPA, found McIntosh's death was justified or \"within policy.\" An officer said McIntosh pointed a gun at him. He fired three shots, killing McIntosh. A gun was found at the scene near McIntosh's body. The case was closed by the agency in October 2015. It did not recommend any disciplinary action against any officer involved, and the Cook County State Attorney did not file criminal charges. CNN has not identified the shooting police officer because he has not been charged or publicly accused of misconduct. There were several other officers on the scene that day, including Officer Sampim. CNN's documentary showed how surveillance video apparently contradicted Sampim's version of the shooting. Sampim told investigators that he was in the middle of an empty lot by a pickup truck when he saw McIntosh point a silver pistol at the shooting officer. Sampim also claimed he saw McIntosh fall down. Surveillance video revealed Sampim was in front of the house, by the sidewalk. The shooting occurred behind the house.Grace tells CNN that he believes \"the evidence will show that with respect to Officer Sampim he was able to make the observations from the vantage point from where he was.\"Roshad McIntosh's son, known as Baby Roshad, stands with his grandmother at a memorial for McIntosh. Lane filed a wrongful death lawsuit in federal court against the City of Chicago and some of the officers involved in 2015. \"I always knew in my heart that the officers lied to cover up for the shooting officer,\" Lane told CNN in response to the news about Officer Sampim. \"There was something in my heart. I never let that go.\"COPA reopened its investigation into McIntosh's killing in August 2017. And now three years later, it is recommending that Sampim be terminated.COPA's recommendation now goes before the Chicago Police Board. The initial status hearing is scheduled for August 5. The local police union, Fraternal Order of Police Chicago Lodge 7, and the Chicago Police Department did not wish to comment on this story.\"I haven't gotten justice yet for my baby,\" Lane said. \"I pray to him just about every night, and I let him know that the fight ain't over.\"",

        "content": "Tavares, Florida (CNN)As Mae Hazelton walked along West Main Street in Tavares, Florida, in her Sunday best, painful childhood memories took over her. Now 65, she remembered seeing crosses burning in the distance and drinking from a water fountain with signs that read \"colored\" and \"white only.\" As she approached the Old Lake County Courthouse, the fear she felt as a girl walking those same streets rushed through her body.The Old Lake County Courthouse stands a the center of the Confederate statue controversy. \"I think about the Black men that were beaten there and tortured there,\" Hazelton said. But she also remembered her grandmother Nellie Virginia Burkes' wise words, \"Fight... for what is right.\"Read MoreHazelton has been in the fight of her life for the past two years.It started in June 2018, when she learned that the statue of Confederate General Edmund Kirby Smith was scheduled to move from the US Capitol to the Old Lake County Courthouse. That's the same courthouse where in 1949 four young African American men, Walter Irvin, Samuel Shepherd, Charles Greenlee and Ernest Thomas -- known as the Groveland Four -- were accused of a crime they didn't commit, tortured and subjected to racially motivated oppression. A tribute to  George Floyd rests on the memorial erected for the Groveland Four at the Old Lake County \nCourthouse. A memorial for the Groveland Four was erected outside the Old Lake County Courthouse last year, when the young men were posthumously pardoned. \"The brutality and injustice that these men endured resulted in the wrongful death of Mr. Thomas and Mr. Shepherd, and the unfair incarcerations of Mr. Irvin and Mr. Greenlee,\" the plaque on the memorial reads.Standing by the memorial, Hazelton said that moving a Confederate statue into a government-owned building known for its racism and oppression against African Americans was just wrong.\"It's evil and wrong and we shouldn't have it here in our community,\" Hazelton said. The statue was headed to the County Historical SocietyDetermined to figure out how a Confederate statue with no link to Lake County could be moved into the community without public input, Hazelton and a group of residents formed a nonprofit organization called Lake County Voices of Reason. And they set off on a mission to uncover the truth. Members of the Lake County Voices of Reason discuss their strategy against the plan to move a Confederate statue into their community. They found that in June 2018, Bob Grenier, the curator of the Lake County Historical Society, requested and applied for the Kirby Smith statue to a Florida Department of State committee in Tallahassee. In a video of the meeting available online through the Florida Channel, Grenier said he had been working to bring the statue to Lake County for two years. He said he had the support of all five Lake County Commissioners.\"I've got emails from them saying 'Go get it Bob. Get the statue, bring it back to Lake County,'\" Grenier said from a podium. A year ago, eight mayors, representing 146,165 residents -- or 40% of the population in Lake County -- wrote a letter to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis opposing the statue's arrival in their county.A Florida county declared itself a 'Second Amendment Sanctuary.' It's not the first to do so \"Confederate Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith had no connection to Lake County and his (statue's) presence would create a negative and hurtful message in our community,\" the letter read. Kirby Smith was born in St. Augustine, located in St. Johns County, on May 16, 1824. His statue was moved to National Statuary Hall at the US Capitol in 1922. In 2019 DeSantis officially requested the Kirby Smith statue be replaced by a statue of Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune, an African American civil rights activist and educator. During a 2019 Lake County Board of County Commissioners meeting, residents spoke for and against the statue.\"As a descendent of Confederate veterans and slave owners, the least I can do to atone for the pain my family has caused them is to oppose this statue,\" Grace Arnold said.\"These statues only exist in a sick attempt to preserve human slavery,\" Choice Edwards said.Commission Chair Leslie Campione defended the statue, saying the display would not glorify the man nor the Confederacy.\"It will describe Smith's military service and will tell about his career as a professor, as a botanist following the Civil War,\" Campione said. \"And his friendship with Dr. Alexander Darnes, who became the first Black doctor in Jacksonville.\"  \"Alexander Darnes was Kirby Smith's slave. Period,\" Hazelton said. She remembered her grandmother's wordsAs news spread of Confederate statues tumbling across the US in the wake of George Floyd's death, Hazelton broke down in tears. But she wasn't defeated. She was ready to keep fighting.\"I will lay my body across the front of that [courthouse] and they will have to arrest me before they put the statue there,\" Hazelton said.When asked what made her keep going, Hazelton said it was those wise words from her grandmother.\"My grandmother was illiterate, but my grandmother said, 'You fight,'\" Hazelton said. \"She said, 'You fight for what is right or you lay down for what's wrong.'\"Mae Hazelton gives a kiss to  her grandmother, Nellie Virginia Burkes. A few days after CNN interviewed Hazelton and requested interviews with Campione and Grenier, which were denied, Campione had a change of heart during a public county commissioner meeting.\"I believe that this entire situation has created really unnecessary strife and division in our community and I know that it's harmed my relationship with some of my friends in the Black community,\" Campione said last Tuesday.Hazelton was present at the meeting and says the tension in the room was palpable. Finally, Lake County Commissioners announced a plan to ask Florida to find the statue a new home. An American flag on West Main Street in Tavares, Florida.\nHazelton says her voice was \"sick with emotion\" because \"African Americans don't prevail a lot in Lake County\" and that day, they had won the fight. \"We are in an inflection point in this country and it is painful. Commissioner Campione, I heard the pain in your voice this morning. Thank you,\" Hazelton said from the podium during the public comment period. \"But nothing is as painful as staying at a point where you know that's not who we are.\"Correction: A previous version of this story misstated the first name of Mae Hazelton in a caption.",

        "content": "Hidalgo County, Texas (CNN)From the sedan's back seat, Melba Coody watched as the mesquite-lined flatland of South Texas rushed by. About a century ago, she explained, her family owned all this property, as far as the eye could see.Christine Molis, her hands on the wheel, knew that already, of course. It was a critical detail of the story her 76-year-old mother was about to retell, the story of what happened in this place -- the single event that, in their view, altered their family's destiny.The narrative had always been there, in relatives' musings about what might have become of the family's wealth and influence if not for the killings so long ago of hundreds of Mexican-Americans by members of the vaunted Texas Rangers who took justice into their own hands.The saga -- known as La Matanza, or The Massacre -- had recently crept onto the public stage with a push for historical markers acknowledging the slayings, along with the era's anti-Mexican rhetoric and unequal treatment of Americans of Mexican descent in the border region.A Texas Historical Commission plaque recalls The Massacre period.Its underlying elements also seemed to be there in the latest headlines about securing the US-Mexico border in the age of President Donald Trump: the militia group detaining migrants in New Mexico, the US citizens asked for ID when a border agent in Montana heard them speak Spanish, the humanitarian crisis faced by migrant children detained in Texas and Trump's own racist tweets insisting Democratic congresswomen of color leave the United States if they don't like his policies. Read MoreThe circumstances of the stories -- then and now -- are not the same. But all hinge on who's welcome in the United States and how to treat those who aren't. And for many descendants of those killed a century ago, the old stories -- often ignored in textbooks and unknown even by those with a firm grasp of US history -- may hold lessons for how to face today's challenges and ensure injustice doesn't again prevail.It's why so many who trace their lines back to the early 20th-century horrors want to share the details of what happened right here in the Rio Grande Valley. \"I tell my kids,\" Coody said as she guided her grown daughter on what would be a pivotal day in the younger woman's understanding of the family history. \"I don't want them to forget this.\"A cemetery that holds a dark secretDry leaves crackled underfoot and dogs barked in the distance as Coody lifted the gate's metal latch. Stepping inside, the elderly woman laid out the crux of the generations-old tale: Here -- on this very spot -- Coody's great-grandfather, Jesus Baz\u00e1n, and her great-uncle, Antonio Longoria, were shot in the back and left to die on September 27, 1915.Baz\u00e1n, 67, and Longoria, 49, were US citizens and prominent landowners of Mexican heritage: Longoria was a US postmaster, a certified school teacher and an elected Hidalgo County commissioner; Baz\u00e1n, even in old age, was known to help area farmers translate Spanish agricultural terms to English.Jesus Baz\u00e1nAntonio LongoriaThe men had traveled that day to the Texas Rangers camp at a nearby ranch to report some stolen horses, Coody said, repeating the story she learned as a girl and one now authorized by the Texas Historical Commission.The conversation at the Sam Lane ranch also included talk of so-called Mexican \"bandits\" -- a crude reference at the time to anyone whose roots traced south of the border, recalled  Roland Warnock, then a 19-year-old cowboy at the ranch, in the 2004 documentary, \"Border Bandits.\" CNN was unable to reach descendants of the ranch's owners. Baz\u00e1n and Longoria left the ranch on horseback, the state record shows. Texas Ranger Captain Henry Ransom and two civilians followed them in a Ford Model T. At some point along the road, a firearm barrel emerged from one of the car's windows. The gunman aimed at Baz\u00e1n and Longoria, still riding up ahead.He pulled the trigger. The men's bodies hit the ground. Their horses galloped away. The Model T drove off. \"Unfazed by the shooting,\" the official narrative goes, \"it was reported that Captain Ransom returned to the campsite to take a nap.\"Texas Rangers pose on October 8, 1915, while holding ropes tied to corpses. The killings came at a time of turmoil in Texas. As the Mexican Revolution seethed to the south and Europe crept toward World War I, Mexican-Americans in the US border state had staged a short-lived revolt against new, non-Hispanic settlers who saw prominent landowners of Mexican descent as inferior. Texas' governor in the early 1910s had sent the Rangers to the border region, ostensibly to broker peace. But it wasn't to be.\"(B)y 1916, hundreds of untrained Rangers patrolled the state, often reigning with terror and intimidation,\" according to the Bullock Texas State History Museum. \"They were assassins with a badge,\" said historian Trinidad Gonzales, who counts a relative among those murdered during the era.During this time in South Texas, anyone who looked \"Mexican\" was racially profiled as a crime suspect, said Monica Mu\u00f1oz Martinez, a Brown University assistant professor who wrote about the period in her book, \"The Injustice Never Leaves You.\" \"That meant that whether you were an American citizen or an ethnic Mexican ... you didn't have the protection or the presumption of innocence until proven guilty,\" she said. \"When ethnic Mexicans had encounters with police, it was very common that people disappeared.\"Those who vanished often turned up dead, their bodies left to rot. The custom was used to intimidate, to incite terror and to discourage families from seeking investigations or prosecution, Martinez said. It all fueled a culture of impunity.The era's racist rhetoric is captured in the handwritten caption of this historical photo.\"It is estimated that hundreds, possibly thousands, of Mexican Americans and Mexicans were killed\" during the years of La Matanza, reads a state marker now planted along Interstate 69 near San Benito, Texas.Some 300 deaths happened in the Rio Grande Valley during the late summer and early fall of 1915 alone, estimated Gonzales, a history instructor at South Texas College. Among the slain were Baz\u00e1n and Longoria.When their empty-saddled horses arrived to Coody's great-grandmother's ranch house, her family knew something had gone horribly wrong. But they were too afraid to push the issue, Coody said. Her great-grandmother, Epigmenia Trevi\u00f1o de Baz\u00e1n, never claimed the bodies.\"This was so painful for my family,\" Coody said. In the humid South Texas heat, the remains of Baz\u00e1n and Longoria festered. After two days, the stench of their decomposing corpses became unbearable, Warnock recalled.\n\n\n'They shot them off their horses'Roland Warnock recalls the deaths of two Mexican-Americans, Jesus Baz\u00e1n and Antonio Longoria, who were shot in the back and left to die on September 27, 1915.\n\nSource: Trans-Pecos Productions \u00a9 All rights reserved\n\n\nRoland Warnock\"We couldn't hardly sleep on the ranch because of the smell,\" he said in the documentary. \"Human scent is the worst scent in the world.\"Warnock buried the men's bodies on the morning of September 29, 1915, accounting for the date -- two days after their death -- etched into their headstones, one of which remains at the plot, while the other looks to have been replaced with a newer slab, Coody said.More than 100 years later, Molis stood over those graves in the cemetery along the country highway. These men had starred in her family tragedy for as long as she could remember. But until now, she'd been separated by place and time from their violent demise. Melba Coody stands at the graves of Baz\u00e1n and Longoria in Texas' Rio Grande Valley.\"It's overwhelming,\" she said. \"I didn't realize this is the spot they were killed.\"\"It happened so many years ago, but it still brings sadness and grief,\" her mother said. She walked toward the cemetery gate, lifted its metal latch and stepped toward the car.A church that never hosted their funeralsBack in the driver's seat, Molis continued down the lane toward the church her once-affluent family owned and shared with its ranching neighbors.Laying eyes on the one-room chapel, tears started to streak Coody's cheeks. The structure's roof had caved in. Its leaning steeple showed fissures. Molis put an arm around her mother, who suffers from diabetes. Did she need food or water, the daughter asked.\"I'm OK,\" Coody said, wiping her face.Baz\u00e1n and Longoria would have been honored with a Catholic funeral at this family church, Coody said.If her great-grandmother had claimed Baz\u00e1n's and Longoria's remains, Coody's family would have held a funeral at this church, she said. The entire community would have gathered to honor the dead in the Catholic tradition.\"They didn't even get to see the bodies,\" Coody said. \"(Someone) just told them, 'This is where they were buried,' maybe a week later.\"Baz\u00e1n and Longoria didn't get caskets, Coody said. They weren't issued death certificates. No wake. No last rites. No death investigations. There was no prosecution. No jury trial. No justice. Still, their loss doesn't live only in regional lore. Both men's names appear on a pair of key documents obtained by CNN: a record held in the US National Archives titled, \"partial list of Mexicans killed\" in the Rio Grande Valley in 1915; and one from Mexico's Genaro Estrada Historical Archives, \"Partial list of Mexicans murdered by the Rangers.\" Their description as Mexicans reflects the era's bigoted vernacular, not a declaration of citizenship. The names of Jesus Baz\u00e1n and Antonio Longoria are listed in a document at the National Archives at College Park, Maryland.Most people at the time were too afraid to speak out against the violence. But in 1919, Texas lawmaker J.T. Canales faced down death threats against himself and his family and led a joint state House and Senate investigation into the Texas Rangers. At the time, Canales, who represented the Brownsville area, was the only Texas state legislator of Mexican descent.More than 1,600 pages of testimony from dozens of people, including officers, landowners and attorneys, make up the most complete set of evidence historians cite when referencing the extrajudicial killings of Mexican-Americans at this time in South Texas.United States soldiers deployed to the US-Mexico border during The Massacre era pose for a photo.The findings revealed a bitter culture among some of the state's lawmen. \"Many of the men of the ranger force pride themselves in their reputation of being quick with their guns and desiring to have the reputation of bad men rather than faithful and efficient officers of the law,\" the legislature's joint investigative report found. Texas state Rep. J.T. CanalesThe probe also exposed crimes of the highest order. \"We find that some of the commanding officers ... are responsible for the gross violation of both civil and criminal laws of this State,\" the report stated. Lawmakers cited offenses including extrajudicial killings, murders, confiscation of firearms without warrants and incarceration without due process.One witness, E.A. Sterling, testified that then-Gov. James Ferguson had told him he'd \"given Ransom\" -- the Ranger captain linked to the killing of Baz\u00e1n and Longoria -- \"instructions to go down there and clean up that nest, that thing had been going on long enough, and to clean it up if he had to kill every damned man connected with it.\" Added Ferguson, according to Sterling, \"I have the pardoning power and we will stand by those men, and I want that bunch -- that gang cleaned up.\" Ferguson later was impeached on matters unrelated to the Rangers. Hundreds of pages detail the findings of a 1919 Texas state investigation into the Rangers' actions.Texas Rangers and their attorneys gave testimony justifying excessive force and denial of due process, Martinez said. They called people of Mexican descent -- including US citizens -- inherently violent and disloyal to the United States.\"Today, we talk about MS-13 and gangs, but 100 years ago, people were talking about (Mexican) bandits and the need to police them violently,\" she said, referring to the criminal enterprise Trump has called \"violent animals.\"Mexican officials recorded the deaths of Baz\u00e1n and Longoria.As a result of the investigation, the Texas Rangers force was downsized from more than 1,300 personnel to fewer than 100, Martinez said, though some former Rangers went on to become sheriffs, prison guards and border patrol agents. And salaries were hiked in an effort to recruit \"men of high moral character,\" according to experts and the report.So many years later, Rangers still operate as a division of the state's Public Safety Department, handling public corruption investigations, tactical incident response and border security operations. The organization's century-old history of violence has no connection to the modern-day force, a department spokesman told the San Antonio Express-News in 2004.\"There's zero correlation,\" Tom Vinger told the newspaper. The Ranger Division and representatives for Gov. Greg Abbott did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.Their silence came as no surprise to Texas state Rep. Terry Canales, the great-nephew of J.T. Canales and a lawmaker representing the Rio Grande Valley.\"It's not something they're either proud of or that they want to acknowledge,\" Terry Canales said of the bloody chapter. \"It's a way to try to either avoid it or pretend like it didn't happen.\"A powerful plaque that links past and futureDown the road east of the church stands a metal marker surrounded by a white wooden fence. \"Baz\u00e1n and Longoria murders,\" reads its title, offering a painful but powerful testament to Coody's family story.\"It makes you feel chills,\" she said as she walked toward the plaque. \"It feels like it just happened.\"Relatives and historians pushed for official acknowledgement of the killings.The official state marker went up in November thanks in large part to Refusing to Forget, a project spearheaded by academics and descendants that aims to commemorate and spark conversations around the centennial of \"the period of widespread, state sanctioned anti-Mexican violence on the Texas-Mexico border (1910-20).\"The sign stands in the heart of a place that remains a sort of ground zero of the modern immigration debate, where more than 1,000 migrants are apprehended daily by US Customs and Border Protection agents of the Rio Grande Valley Sector, the agency reported this month. \"The majority of these apprehensions are people turning themselves in to the first Border Patrol Agent they encounter,\" it noted.Nearly two dozen of Coody's relatives and friends gathered recently at the historical marker to share their grief over the deaths of Baz\u00e1n and Longoria. Many could not ignore the story lines unfolding in their own time around questions of national identity, race and ethnicity. Baz\u00e1n's great-great-granddaughter, Carla Villarreal, cited today's political rhetoric to argue that the history is repeating itself. She recalled the 2015 speech that launched Trump's campaign for president, in which he referred to Mexican migrants as \"rapists,\" as well as his use of the term \"invasion\" to describe the arrival of Central American migrants to the US' southern border.Trump joked during a recent rally in Panama City Beach, Florida, about the treatment of migrants crossing the border, chuckling when a rally-goer suggested shooting them. \"That's only in the Panhandle you can get away with that statement,\" the President said in early May.\"Everybody is a murderer, a thief, a rapist, a gang member,\" Villarreal told CNN of the modern perception some have of Hispanic immigrants. \"That is not true. The rhetoric is terrible.\"Trinidad GonzalesGonzales, the historian, argued that dehumanizing a population is a first step toward justifying its abuse. He doesn't believe today's immigration rhetoric will lead to the killings of Mexican-Americans, per se, he said, but warned that allowing dangerous commentary to continue unchecked will pave the way for their mistreatment.Another relative, Irma Baz\u00e1n Villarreal, said she doesn't think the massacre period is \"going to be repeated because no one comes out and shoots them because they are coming across (the border).\"\"Back then there was just no law and order,\" she told CNN.But another descendant, Roberto Rodriguez, advised: \"If you don't know history you're doomed to repeat it.\" He pointed to US troops getting dispatched to the Mexico border. \"I think this type of policy normalizes the notion that the group is a threat, which can have the consequence of violence directed at that group,\" he said. In Texas, officials haven't all learned from the dark history, state House member Canales said, noting the so-called \"show me your papers\" law that allows Texas law enforcement officers to ask about someone's immigration status during a lawful stop or arrest. The ACLU and others have criticized it, saying it corrodes trust in law enforcement.\"I tell people that history may not repeat itself,\" Canales said, \"but it sure rhymes.\"The gathered descendants agreed on one thing: the killings of Baz\u00e1n and Longoria changed a family forever.\"Who knows where we would be now if this hadn't happened, if my grandfather would have lived, if he would have raised the children,\" wondered Hector Garcia, a relative of Baz\u00e1n.Descendants of Baz\u00e1n and Longoria gather to reflect on how their relatives died and to discuss modern immigration. Coody's great-grandmother became a single mother of 10 children overnight when her husband, Baz\u00e1n, was killed. To make ends meet, she sold most of her property, though not before setting aside 107 acres for each of her children, Coody said. Christine MolisTogether, the family lived off the land, planting vegetables and corn for tortillas. They bottled their own tomatoes and even had a recipe to make candy from beans. The siblings stayed on the ranch until the 1950s, she said, then spread out to towns across the Rio Grande Valley.\"To me, what happened that day changed our destiny as a family,\" Elizabeth Baz\u00e1n Puente, 53, said of her great-grandfather's fate. \"All of us here would have grown up so much closer.\"\"It's an injustice that never leaves you,\" Coody said.Still, Coody wouldn't want to bury the past, both in case it could spur a more compassionate future and because it is part of her. \"I think that my daughter, who is very involved, will keep the story going,\" she said. \"It's our family history,\" Molis agreed, \"and it needs to be told and retold.\"CNN's Jeremy Moorhead contributed to this story.",

        "content": "(CNN)Melba Coody didn't think the old plotline could unfold again: a mass killing along the US-Mexico border at the hands of a white gunman apparently driven by bigotry and willing to take justice into his own hands.It's how her great-grandfather's and great-uncle's lives ended in 1915. The men, both American citizens of Mexican descent, were fatally shot along a Texas road during La Matanza, or The Massacre, a bloody period when members of the vaunted Texas Rangers slayed hundreds of Mexican-Americans amid a climate of racism and hate.  Their ancestors were slain a century ago along the US-Mexico border. They say now is the time to retell the horrorCoody had believed -- even in an era of racist presidential tweets, private border militias and a humanitarian crisis among migrant children -- that the kind of horror her ancestors experienced could be consigned to history. \"And look at what happened,\" the 76-year-old woman told CNN as she wept over the weekend massacre in El Paso, Texas, that left 22 people dead and 24 more injured. Their accused killer is a white supremacist who wanted to stop a \"Hispanic invasion of Texas,\" according to a manifesto police believe he wrote.\"I can't believe people are doing things like they used to do many, many years ago: the racism,\" Coody said. \"What the Texas Rangers did to my great-grandfather -- killed him just because they were riding around thinking that they were murderers of other people and robbers, most of all. And now this. I don't know what to think except it's very hurtful, and it's bad that things are happening again like they did many, many years ago.\"Read MorePhysical violence again \"has reared its ugly head, and it's as real now as it was then,\" said Texas state Rep. Terry Canales, a Rio Grande Valley Democrat whose great-uncle spearheaded an inquiry in 1919 into extrajudicial killings by the Rangers. \"What we are watching in El Paso is one of the most gut-wrenching, sad, horrible, cowardly acts, and it's not far from what was exactly happening 100 years ago.\"Rhetoric that harks back a centurySome descendants of those slain during the Matanza period had warned in the months before horror hit El Paso that mounting anti-immigrant sentiment could set the stage for the sort of targeted violence that played out in the crowded Walmart. They cited, in part, President Donald Trump's use of the term \"invasion\" to describe the arrival of Central American migrants to the southern US border and his chuckling response to a rally-goer who suggested simply shooting migrants. Those examples and more, they said, could tacitly give license to people inclined to mistreat those they deem unwelcome in the United States.Obama takes on hate and Trump takes on ObamaTo be sure, last week's atrocity was not authorized by any government, as the official investigation found the century-old Ranger killings had been. Texas prosecutors already have charged the alleged El Paso gunman with capital murder, while US Justice Department officials are treating the case as domestic terrorism and \"seriously considering\" lodging hate crime charges that could carry the death penalty. Trump, meanwhile, called on the nation following the El Paso attack and another mass shooting hours later in Dayton, Ohio, to condemn racism and white supremacy. He has slammed video games and the internet for stoking an atmosphere of violence, pointed to mental illness for motivating killers and signaled support for so-called \"red flag\" laws that would keep firearms away from \"those judged to pose a grave risk to public safety.\" But the President has stayed away from discussing the impact of his own divisive words on the political climate. Indeed, the accused shooter's online writings reflect ideas that have been shared by Trump, Fox News and the Republican Party, including the warning of \"a Hispanic invasion.\" The writer noted that he'd held these beliefs for years -- notably, before Trump became President. The themes hark back to what experts call \"the period of widespread, state sanctioned anti-Mexican violence on the Texas-Mexico border (1910-20),\" said Monica Mu\u00f1oz Martinez, a Brown University assistant professor who wrote about the era in her book, \"The Injustice Never Leaves You.\"A Texas Historical Commission plaque recalls The Massacre period.\"What's really troubling is that the rhetoric that is coming from this current administration is echoing the eugenic sentiment and language that was used by eugenicists and nativists from the early 20th century,\" she said. \"Like the word, 'infestation,' and the word, 'invasion,' it was something that was used to mobilize and not only to police the border but also to police anyone who looked Mexican in the region.\"\"I am also very concerned about the ongoing policies on the border, like family separation, which I think gives license to people being dehumanized,\" Martinez said. \"We need to study how that inspires racism and an extremist to also not value Mexican life and immigrant life and Latinos.\"  While Trump didn't coin the \"white nationalist rhetoric and racist ideologies against Latinos, ... it is very clear that he uses the same language as part of his politics,\" said South Texas College historian Trinidad Gonzales, who counts a relative among those murdered during La Matanza.\"You see it very clearly by the shooter having to clarify that the ideas did not come from Trump, because Trump has the same ideas,\" he said, \"and that is disturbing.\"'We've been tormented as a people'The violence in El Paso hit at a deep-rooted unity among residents of Hispanic descent who, for many decades, have lived in what's effectively a single community that spans the Texas border city and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. An economic and cultural hub, the metro area is a far cry from the dangerous and \"infested\" place that white nationalists and others describe, Martinez said. That bigoted rhetoric echoes the false claims made a century ago by Rangers who'd accuse law-abiding people of Mexican descent of being \"bandits\" as justification for murdering them.The Massacre era's racist rhetoric is captured in the handwritten caption of this historical photo.Abbott has called the El Paso shooting \"a heinous and senseless act of violence.\" The Texas Department of Public Safety is assisting El Paso police in the shooting investigation, he said in a statement, adding that the Texas Rangers and other state resources were deployed in a support role.But damage -- even beyond lives stolen and families shattered -- has been done. Their culture made them targets. Now, it's what is helping them heal \"You can grow up all your life on the border and not feel that someone is going to shoot you simply because you're brown,\" Gonzales said. \"That security is gone.\"\"I think this shooter has taken more than just lives,\" Canales said. \"He has taken a piece of who we are. He has taken a part of our sanity, a part of our hearts, a part of our souls and a part of our security.\"Perhaps a part, but not all.  Just two days after the Walmart carnage, Aztec dance groups performed prayers for the victims in a powerful and defiant display of the region's heritage.\"We've been tormented as a people,\" performer Gisela Sarellano said. \"I like the idea of using our culture -- that they're so threatened by -- to combat that, to fight their hatred with beauty.\"'I don't think it's going to stop'Beyond apparently being targeted because of their ethnicity, Coody sees another link between her forebears who were killed by a Ranger -- one a county commissioner and teacher, the other a Spanish-to-English translator for his neighbors -- and the shoppers gunned down while perusing backpacks and notebooks and graphing calculators at Walmart.How you can help victims of the shootings in El Paso and Dayton\"These people that were killed in El Paso, that horrible tragedy, were educated people and not just anybody,\" she said. \"They were people that were shopping and getting ready for school, and look at what happened. \"My great-grandfather and my great-uncle were also just, you know, they were educated, and this happened to them,\" she said. \"That's why I say that if it happens again, it could happen to anyone.\"Abbott's office and the state Department of Public Safety's Ranger Division did not respond to CNN's requests for comment about the Ranger's century-old history of violence. Those acts have no connection to the modern-day force, a department spokesman told the San Antonio Express-News in 2004.Christine Molis holds a photo of her slain relative.Coody's grown daughter, Christine Molis, did not think immediately of her family's Matanza link when she heard of the carnage in El Paso, she told CNN. But the questions that flooded her mind mirror those that have driven a recent push for official markers to acknowledge the early 20th-century slayings and -- the hope had been -- thwart similar injustices. \"It made me think about: Why would he target just them? What have we done? What did they do to him? They are just normal people going about their normal lives, like everybody else,\" Molis said. \"How do you know they are not American citizens? Just because they're of Mexican descent?\"Reflecting on the bloodshed in El Paso, the answers seemed no nearer than they were a hundred years ago. \"It's been going on for over a century,\" Molis said. \"And I don't think it's going to stop, not in the world we are living in today.\"",

The street looked like it always did at that time of night, a few vehicles parked on a well-lit street in the heart of Chicago's Puerto Rican community.Then her eyes locked on something.\"Una van blanca,\" she said.  A windowless white van with red flashers caught her attention. \"Could it be ICE?\" she feared.Read MoreFrancisca Lino looks out onto the street outside Adalberto United Methodist Church in Chicago on July 13.Lino is undocumented and the mother of four US citizens. And for nearly two years now, she has been living on the second floor of Adalberto United Methodist Church in Chicago's west side.  In 2017, she decided to take sanctuary after immigration officials told her to pack her bags and show up at a downtown federal building with a one-way ticket out of the country. Instead of following orders from immigration agents, she followed her heart and sought shelter at a church, a place ICE normally doesn't raid.But with immigration raids announced for this weekend in cities around the country, including Chicago, Lino was especially on edge.\"Me da panico,\" she said.Lino says she gets anxiety attacks at night sometimes from just thinking and thinking about how little control she has over her life. There is nothing normal about living locked inside a church, she says. To escape her reality she stands by her window for hours people watching. She reminisces walking down the sidewalk. She thinks about what it was like to work and shop on her own.Francisca Lino often thinks about being able to walk outside, on the sidewalks, again.\"I feel such deep nostalgia,\" she said. \"I even cry wondering if I will walk the streets again.\"Lino says she yearns for the moment when she can rush beyond the doors to help her daughters solve a problem when they call needing their mother. \"That's what hurts me the most,\" Lino said.Away from her husband and children Lino says she decided to take refuge in a church to maintain the tight-knit bonds with her family.  And early on, living in sanctuary felt like the optimal solution. Her daughters stayed the night and her husband and friends visited often. But the past two years have been tough.She missed seeing her daughter walk the stage after earning a Master's degree in social work. She missed her daughter's marriage and first birth. The visits from her family are shorter and materialize less often. Even the family text message group is not pinging her phone as much.\"It hurts,\" Lino said. \"It makes me sad.\"Francisca Lino, left, talks and laughs with her twin 17-year-old daughters Judith, center, and Juliana, right.It makes her husband Diego Lino sad too. When he visited Saturday his eyes were blood shot. He says he picked up a second job to help make ends meet since his wife can't work. He wakes up at 2:30 a.m. and works seven days a week. The drive to see his wife in the church is a two-hour round trip.\"It's tough,\" Diego Lino said. \"But I have to move my family forward.\"From her bedroom window overlooking a barbershop and a mural that says \"0 shots, 0 killed today in Chicago,\" Lino mulls over her life-altering decision which in many ways equates to self-incarceration. And while doubts cross her mind she says she feels she has made the right choice. \"I feel it has been worth it,\" Lino said. \"At least I see my daughters on the weekends.\"A life inside the church Inside Adalberto United Methodist Church Lino has found a new family. The pastor's daughter, Janette Alonso calls her \"sister\" and treats her like one, too. Even Alonso's three children call Lino \"sister.\" And this weekend her sanctuary family was there with Lino around the clock. \"It's kind of stressful,\" Alonso said. \"I have to be looking out the window. Hopefully nothing happens.\"Throughout the weekend, Lino and Alonso kept an eye out for strange cars. When the children shut a door loudly behind her, Lino jumped started. Even a call from her husband from an unknown number spiked her anxiety. She thought twice about answering.Francisca Lino, left, and Evelia Romero, center, listen as Pastor Emma Lozono speaks to the congregation about immigration during a service at Adalberto United Methodist Church in Chicago, on July 14.

A newspaper article with her photo is posted on a bulletin board that can be seen through the first floor glass window of the church.

        "content": "(CNN)Maximo, an asylum seeker, fled his native Honduras with his son to seek a new life in the United States.But while waiting for their cases to be heard he says they have practically become prisoners in a shelter for migrants in the Mexican border town of Nuevo Laredo, where cartels prey on migrants who venture out into the streets. He and his son were nearly kidnapped, he says.\"We are alone and only God's hand has kept us safe from the constant danger that surges in this country,\" he wrote in a letter. \"We don't intend to cause any harm to the United States. We would just like a safe place [to wait] for a response from the government.\"Maximo is among tens of thousands of asylum seekers who under Trump administration policy must wait in Mexico for their US immigration proceedings. He and nearly two dozen other migrants at the border responded to a request from Denise LaRock, an American nun who advocates for immigrants, to write letters explaining their hazardous situation. LaRock told the migrants she would share the letters with journalists to bring attention to the dangers they face. Read MoreCNN is only using the migrants' first names due to safety concerns and has translated the letters to English.Asylum seekers living in Nuevo Laredo wrote heartbreaking letters telling of kidnapping and death. The envelopes are handmade.LaRock has been serving some 200 asylum seekers, mostly from Central America, who live in shelters provided by Lorenzo Ortiz, a pastor from a ministry called El Buen Samaritano Migrante. Among the asylum seekers are a former police officer, a mechanical engineer, a mechanic and a university student. The shelters, including four churches and one home, are crowded and have little to no furniture. The migrants sleep on cots or on the floor. And the surrounding neighborhoods are so dangerous, they write, that walking outside the shelter could result in kidnapping or death. \"Kidnapping is the daily bread [here],\" wrote Maria, another migrant.\"Mexico is the same or worse than Honduras,\" wrote a third, Elsa. \"We are in prison here because of the danger, because the cartels are in every corner.\"Thousands of migrants are waiting in limbo Roughly 60,000 migrants have been returned to Mexico since the start last spring of the administration's \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, which requires asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for their cases to be resolved. The Trump administration has credited the program with helping decrease the number of migrants arriving at the US-Mexico border and easing the ongoing border crisis.But Ortiz says the migrants at the border face new dangers. He says the cartels case the bus stations and the streets near the immigration office looking for Central Americans. The asylum seekers, he says, are easy targets because they are usually released by US authorities wearing shoes without laces and carrying a manila folder with documents and a plastic bag with their belongings.A migrant mother and her child have claimed this corner at one of Ortiz's shelters along the border.One migrant, Tere, wrote that she and her 7-year-old son were kidnapped once they reached the US border and were held for nine days without food. They were only released after her family paid a ransom, she wrote.\"I thank God for freeing me from that terrible experience,\" wrote Tere, who says her asylum court date in the US is next February.In their letters many of the migrants thanked Ortiz, and God, for their survival.Ortiz told CNN some migrants have been kidnapped more than once and that others have been sexually assaulted or have lost fingers to the cartels. At least four families who were kidnapped have not returned, Ortiz said. \"The danger is real,\" he told CNN by phone.A cartel raided one of his shelters at gunpoint about two months ago, he said. But he said the cartel didn't hurt anyone after they learned the shelter was run by a pastor.Keeping the migrants fed, and safeLaRock is a US citizen and says she has been crossing the border from Laredo, Texas, in Ortiz's van every Wednesday for the past two months to bring supplies to the shelters. She packs the van with cooking oil, beans, diapers, blankets, clothes, puzzles and anything else her Interfaith Welcome Coalition can gather to help address the migrants' basic needs.She also started a GoFundMe page to help Ortiz pay rent, electricity, water and food for the shelters.The women at Ortiz's shelter do the cooking but not the grocery shopping because it's too dangerous for them to leave the building.LaRock says she hopes the migrants' desperate letters will help other Americans understand how US policies are exposing asylum seekers to some of the same dangers they fled in their native countries.\"My hope is that people... can have compassion,\" LaRock told CNN by phone.Meanwhile, the migrants in Nuevo Laredo hope their future will somehow be brighter.\"I regretted leaving my country,\" wrote Lilian, a Honduran waiting at a border shelter with her daughter, in her letter. But the poverty in Honduras was too severe and her daughter had no future there, she said. \"The goal of every mother is to look for something better for their children.\"",

About 11,900 children were detained in June, and that number rose to 12,800 in September and to 14,000 in November. By December, the number of children in Health and Human Services custody reached nearly 15,000, according to an HHS official. The number of detained children began to drop in January, when an HHS official told CNN that about 11,400 minors were in custody.Idis Nicol left her native Honduras last summer to meet up with her father, who has been in Florida for about 10 years. Her father said she was detained at the US-Mexico border by immigration officials in July.Armando Tabora and Idis Nicol.Because she's a minor, she was placed in HHS custody. That's when her 36-year-old father began the process to get her out of detention and obtain custody.\"I feel such sorrow,\" Armando Tabora told CNN last year by phone.At the time, Tabora said he had provided the US Government everything he was asked for: his personal contact information, his fingerprints and the fingerprints of an emergency contact. Protectively, he signed over legal guardianship of his daughter to a US citizen in case anything were to happen to him.But perhaps the most difficult request to fulfill was that he get an apartment on his own -- for him and his daughter. Tabora said he works odd jobs -- working construction, cleaning homes, cleaning cars and doing lawn work -- and he couldn't afford to pay rent on his own. But he saved up, and by the end of November he rented a place hoping that would be the last step in the process to reunite with his daughter.JUST WATCHEDHHS: 14K unaccompanied immigrant kids in US custodyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHHS: 14K unaccompanied immigrant kids in US custody 02:03It was, but then came months more of waiting. Since November 2018, Tabora said, he has been told the reunion would happen any day now. And that any day now has taken four more months.Meanwhile, Idis Nicol waited inside a child shelter in Brownsville, Texas, with other children. She said that, like her father, she, too, was told she would be out soon. She was treated well inside the facility, she said, but at times became anxious.\"Sometimes I felt desperate because I couldn't see my family,\" Idis Nicol said.HHS did not comment on Idis Nicol's case, but said in an email that its first mission is \"to create a safe and healthy environment in our shelters, one that ensures access to nutritious food, clean clothes, education and medical services.\"\"The second is to identify the most appropriate and least restrictive placement, usually with a sponsor, for each child while they await their US immigration proceedings,\" HHS said.Idis Nichol said counselors advised her during those tough moments, and she tried to distract herself by playing games. She wasn't the only child at the shelter who wanted out of detention. Idis Nicol said about a month ago a girl tried to escape the facility but failed.HHS docs show thousands of alleged incidents of sexual abuse against unaccompanied minors in custodyThinking back, she said the days went by fast.

He signed a few documents and was handed a manila folder with instructions on what to do next.\"I feel very excited.

The young girl's concrete tomb is on a hill surrounded by trees, with a turquoise cross that bears her name and the date she was laid to rest in silver letters.Her father was placing white and green paper flowers on the tomb the day CNN visited. He remembered the last time he saw his daughter alive: He was talking to her through video chat while she was in a hospital in Nebraska. Geovany ValleDarlyn was encountered by Border Patrol on March 1, 2018, a few miles west of Hidalgo, Texas. She complained of chest pain and  three days later, was transferred to HHS custody where she remained for about seven months. Darlyn was treated for a congenital heart defect at various hospitals -- including in San Antonio, Texas and Phoenix, Arizona. Read MoreHHS spokesperson Mark Weber told CNN Darlyn had surgery complications that left her in a comatose state. She was transported to a nursing facility in Phoenix and later to Children's Hospital in Omaha, Nebraska, where she died on September 29, due to fever and respiratory distress. Mother of 10-year-old who died in US custody says daughter was born with a heart murmur As Valle was on the phone with his daughter back then, he was desperate for a sign of life. \"Give me a signal, I want to know that you can hear me. I want to know that you are seeing me,\" he said he told Darlyn.\"She made an effort four times and she tried to speak,\" he said. \"And that was it.\"'I could have asked her to stay'The young girl was traveling to the US to find her mom, who had migrated from El Salvador to work and provide for her three daughters. A US Customs and Border Protection official identified the 10-year-old El Salvadorian girl that died in the custody of HHS in September 2018 as Darlyn Cristabel Cordova-Valle. Darlyn stayed back with her aunt, but nine years later, Darlyn -- like so many Central American children who are currently flocking to the US southern border -- made the journey to reunite with her mother in the US. The girl traveled with acquaintances by car for four days from El Salvador to the border, her mother said. Her mother, who now lives in Omaha, Nebraska, told CNN Darlyn was just a year old when she left her behind with her aunt, Jesus Valle. The two live in a humble home on a lush hill -- in a town not far from the cemetery where the child was laid to rest. \"She was like a daughter to me,\" Jesus Valle said. \"I loved her so much.\"Surrounded by Darlyn's clothing and toys, her aunt wonders what could have been if Darlyn had stayed in El Salvador.\"When she left I could have asked her to stay. But her mom was taking her back. And I didn't want to keep her from her right to be with her mom,\" Jesus Valle said.CNN en Espa\u00f1ol's Merlin Delcid reported from El Salvador, with CNN's Jamie Ehrlich, Kate Sullivan, Madeline Holcombe and Dianne Gallagher contributing to this report.",

As  they look back at their now ravaged island home, some have left  spouses, sons and parents in conditions that bring tears to their eyes.  The story on this flight is not just about evacuating from the most devastating storm to hit Puerto Rico in a century, it's also about the separation of families for the greater good. The people aboard the flight are the spouses and children of federal  agents who work for US Customs and Border Protection.  These CBP agents  are playing critical roles in the reopening of the airport and ports of  entry, which are the lifelines of food and supplies for so many who are  in desperate need of food, water, power and communication to the  outside world.Lydia Acevedo, her year-old grandson Mateo and her daughter\nNayelys aboard the evacuation flight. \"Having to separate is not easy, but we have to think positive.  We have to think that this will pass soon and we will be able to reunite,\" says Lydia Acevedo with tears in her eyes.  Her husband works at the airport.  Acevedo says she had to take the role of head of household when the hurricane hit.  Her husband was helping everyone else in Puerto Rico and she had to take the lead in looking for food and water for her family. Puerto Ricans still waiting for aid a week after Maria's devastationRead MoreThe DASH 8 plane evacuating Acevedo and 23 other family members of federal agents, and two pets, is normally used for intelligence missions.  It's a twin engine prop plane with giant computers in the back and a cargo area. But Wednesday, the aircraft was on a dual mission in Puerto Rico: 1. Deliver 3,500 pounds of water, MRE's and baby supplies.2. Evacuate the family members of CBP personnel from San Juan to Homestead, Florida.Olga Martinez is 65 and her daughter stayed in San Juan, working at the incident command center.  Martinez says she was without power, water and down to one can of corned beef, one can of sausages and some crackers.  She yearns for a warm cup of coffee, a staple she hasn't had in days.  She misses her daughter but plans to stay with a niece in Weston, Florida, for now.On the back cargo section of the plane were Pandylucas and Benjamin, two Yorkies in a kennel.  Vanessa Carbia wouldn't leave her home without  them. She's aboard with her three children, ages 11 to 19.  Carbia's husband is a CBP supervisor and was working around the clock to help reconnect Puerto Rico to the world.  Pitbull sends private plane to Puerto Rico to transport cancer patients Meanwhile, Carbia says she only had food for four days and was left rationing it, never thinking she would have to evacuate on a flight with other families. With a heart heavy from the devastation and the worry her children would be traumatized, she says she tried to manage her children's fears and worries while their father was working. Food and water shortages, she says, were difficult to reckon with. \"When you see children waiting in line for food and water,\" Carbia says and pauses. \"That was the most impactful.\"Carbia plans to stay in a hotel for now but says she has family in Arizona.Acevedo faced a mixture of traumas, including her fear for the well-being of the her 1-year-old grandson, Mateo, who suffers from asthma.  He was running out of formula, and then there was the heat and humidity and the insects that come with it. Mosquito bites still cover part of Mateo's cheeks and arms.  Acevedo was on the flight with her 14-year-old daughter, 22-year-old daughter, her son-in-law, 1-year-old grandson and her 72-year-old mother. She has family in Illinois and for now plans to stay in a hotel.But like everyone else aboard she vows to return to Puerto Rico to reunite with the piece of their hearts left behind.\"My whole life is there,\" says Carbia.",

Thousands arrived at the George R. Brown Convention Center after being plucked from rooftops by rescuers in helicopters or scooped up by volunteer emergency responders in boats. Many have lost everything to flooding from Tropical Storm Harvey's relentless rains.The center was initially set up with 5,000 cots. As of early Tuesday morning, 9,021 evacuees had checked into the sprawling convention center on the east side of Houston's downtown. Thousands rescued as Harvey's waters riseCrowd control is going smoothly and meals are being served on a regular basis, said Tom McCasland, director of the Housing and Community Development Department. Pets are welcome, too, and the Red Cross expects to have enough food to feed 20,000 people.\"Our doors remain open,\" he said, addressing concerns that the city was running out of space. But to relieve pressure on the facility as more evacuees come in, another shelter is opening nearby on Tuesday afternoon, he said.

Hanna said she and a friend were rescued from floodwaters by kayak, then transported to Sheldon Elementary School on an Army truck. Once conditions at the school deteriorated, Hanna said a convoy of 14 school buses brought people and their pets to the convention center.

And just by the grace of God we were able to come here and have somewhere to stay.\"Supplies keep coming inRed Cross Spokesperson Anthony Tornetta told CNN the agency readied supplies ahead of Harvey's arrival and is continuing to bring in more. \"We're going to ensure that people that have been affected have everything they need as they go forward,\" Tornetta said.

She was then taken to a boat, which dropped her, her husband, and her 17-year-old son off at a Walmart. From there a bus brought them to the convention center. Preston has high blood pressure and is recovering from knee surgery. Since the storm hit she said she's already waited in many long lines for help. When she arrived at the convention center and was given a blanket and pillow, it was enough to bring her to tears -- a sign of the mental and emotional stress many evacuees are experiencing.Harvey evacuee Karen Preston cries after being given a blanket and pillow at the Houston convention center.Evacuee Isaac Sandoval says the hardest part of his ordeal was being separated from his family when there wasn't enough room for him on their rescue boat.\"When what you love is far away from you, it's pretty hard,\" Sandoval said.Heartbreaking story of #houston father who says there was only room for his wife and children on the rescue boat,... https://t.co/yqoPxBLldV\u2014 Rosa Flores (@RosaFlores) August 29, 2017\nOnce his wife and four children were loaded onto the boat Sandoval had to watch as they were driven away, then wait another eight hours for his rescue. \"To think that you cannot do anything for them, it's hard,\" Sandoval said while fighting back tears. The family was reunited at the convention center, where husband and wife swapped stories about their ordeals, including how hard it was to see other families struggling to get through floodwaters.Donations still acceptedThe convention center also has an area where volunteers can drop off donations. Right now, they're in desperate need of wheelchairs, hospital socks and blankets, said Andrew Kincannon of Houston Fire EMS. The center's website says that clothing, baby formula, bottled water and non-perishable food also are needed.Tornetta, the Red Cross spokesman, said the agency has more than 30 shelters set up throughout the Gulf Coast region. Some evacuees may be transferred to other locations to make sure everyone has a roof over their head, he said.Dallas, hundreds of miles to the north, also is preparing to open a mega-shelter for Harvey evacuees at its downtown convention center.CNN's Kevin Conlon contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Story highlightsRosa Flores was a CPA before becoming a journalistShe credits Our Lady of Guadalupe with guiding her career change (CNN)I thought my career was set when I was 22.I was about to graduate from The University of Texas at Austin with a bachelor's degree in business administration and a master's in accounting, and I was recruited by the largest accounting firms in the world.  The only thing outstanding for me to do was to pass the certified public accountant exam.My confidence was sucker-punched when I learned that the CPA exam's national passing rate for first time takers was as low as 10%. I knew I was in trouble.  So, I did what my mother and my grandmother taught me to do as a child. I prayed to Our Lady of Guadalupe, or \"Virgencita,\" as I call her in Spanish.  I prayed for guidance, not realizing that putting my future in her hands would change my life's direction.I made a promise to Our Lady of Guadalupe that if I passed the CPA exam I'd deliver food and clothing to the indigent in Mexico. I studied day and night with a faith so strong it left no room for doubt about my success.Read MoreSitting for the CPA exam was a marathon.  At the time, it was nearly a 16-hour paper and pencil test divided into four parts and taken over two days. I remember walking out of the 16th hour of testing with bruised confidence and thinking, \"Virgencita, sorry, there's no way I passed that test.\"Several months later, I learned that I passed on the first try, and I landed a job with KPMG, one of the largest accounting firms in the world.\"Virgencita, this was all you,'\"I thought.   Fulfilling a promiseIn haste, I packed my stuff and drove from Austin, Texas, to the southernmost tip of Texas to the place where I grew up, the Rio Grande Valley.Delivering on my promise to Our Lady of Guadalupe became a family project, with my mom, grandmother, nieces and nephews hopping into a truck to shop for food and clothing and then driving into Nuevo Progreso, Mexico, to hand deliver the goods to people.I met hungry children and senior citizens who changed my life. I met people from Central America who had walked through much of Mexico to get to the border with the United States.  Most of them owned nothing else but the clothes on their backs and the little cardboard shacks they made on the levee of the Rio Grande for shelter.As I was delivering food to moms and toys to kids, one young boy said, \"Can I please have the food and not toys?  My mom is bedridden, and she can't come get the food.\"My heart stopped, and somehow a giant void was created in my chest, a heavy void that I couldn't explain.It sounds cliche, but that moment truly changed my life. I was no longer the 22 year old who thought she had everything figured out. I knew I had been touched by the power of prayer, but I didn't know where that epiphany would take me.\"Virgencita what does this mean? What should I do?\" I prayed.Rosa Flores discovered her calling after visiting with people in Mexico. Finding my callingFor the next two years, I was on a mission to find my new path. I volunteered for every imaginable nonprofit organization and even earned KPMG's national award for community service.  I thought, \"Maybe I'm supposed to teach children.\" So, I applied for teaching jobs and never got a call back. Then I thought, \"I need to run a charity.\" So, I applied for jobs in the nonprofit sector and never got a call back.  I returned to Nuevo Progreso to deliver food and clothing and to look for the little boy who changed the direction of my life, but I never found him or his mother.Then on a typical day at the office, my prayer was answered.  Something hit me.  I knew exactly what I needed to do.I realized it was the stories of the people I met in Mexico that changed my life: the little boy with a sick mom, the elderly who didn't have blankets, the families whose homes had three cardboard walls.I quit my job as a CPA shortly thereafter and went back to UT Austin for a bachelor's degree in broadcast journalism.  My friends and family thought I had gone crazy.  My only hope was to tell stories.  To tell stories like the ones that changed my life.Jobs in television followed quickly, starting in Oklahoma City then, Houston, New Orleans and Baton Rouge.  Less than a decade later, I joined CNN, where I currently have the privilege of covering stories nationally and internationally.Is it a coincidence?  I like to call it faith.  An answered prayer.  Or what happens when you surrender your life to something much bigger than yourself.All I know is that every story I cover that sheds light on a forgotten community or on the poor reminds me of that little boy who preferred the food over the toys and the giant void I felt in my chest after meeting him. Has it been easy?  Let me put it this way, I pray to Virgencita every day.If you don't believe, it might be difficult for you to understand.  But, I know she places opportunities in my path that will continue to fill in that void, that yearning to tell the stories of the poor, the less fortunate, the voiceless.Covering Pope Francis' visit to Ecuador, Bolivia and Paraguay is a perfect example.  I profiled stories of women such as \"Abuela Asuncion,\" who cooked for Francis out of her dirt floor home, and Mary Torres who raised cockfighting roosters to make ends meet.JUST WATCHEDPope brings hope to Ecuador's poorReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPope brings hope to Ecuador's poor 02:18 Flying with Pope Francis on the papal plane during his visit to Cuba and the United States is yet another example. On board the plane, I shared my devotion to Virgencita with the Pope and gave him a prayer card of Our Lady of Guadalupe.  Not only was I devout to Virgencita; all of my research on Pope Francis indicated he was, too.We were on the papal plane 10,000 feet up in the air somewhere between Rome and Cuba.  During our 45 second exchange, Pope Francis scorned a priest, popped a joke and gave me his blessing. When I showed him the prayer card, he grabbed it from my hand and started kissing it.One of the most memorable moments of my life! #popefrancis offers me his blessing on the #papalplane More on @CNN pic.twitter.com/COsnVLPxrV\u2014 Rosa Flores (@RosaFlores) September 19, 2015\nNow that I'm flying on the papal plane again with Pope Francis, the Pope of the poor, during his visit to Mexico I reflect on that promise I made to Our Lady of Guadalupe years ago. And how delivering on that promise in Mexico triggered a career change that has allowed me to tell the stories of the poor nationally and internationally.  How I'll never forget that little boy who preferred the food over the toys. He was probably grateful because I fed him that one day; I'm grateful because he will feed my soul for the rest of my life.",

Upon reviewing the emails, UCLA police tracked the author, identified as Matthew Christopher Harris, 31, to Colorado, Boulder Police Chief Maris Herold announced on Tuesday. \"Upon reviewing parts of the manifesto, we identified thousands of references to violence, stating things such as 'killing, death, murder, shootings, bombs, schoolyard massacre in Boulder,' and phrases like 'burn and attack Boulder' outside of the university,\" Herold said.\"The level of violence that we saw in the manifesto was obviously so alarming,\" said the chief. \"I can tell you it was very violent, very disturbing.\"The Boulder PD SWAT team was activated shortly before 8 a.m. local time and nearby schools, homes, and businesses were evacuated while the suspect's apartment was surrounded.Read MoreA crisis-intervention team and negotiators reached Harris by phone and after speaking to him several times very briefly, took him into custody without incident, Herold said.It is unclear whether Harris has an attorney.\"Today was a scary day for the people of Boulder,\" said Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty. Harris was being held on state charges, but Dougherty's office later said the suspect was being transferred to federal custody as of Tuesday evening and is expected to face federal charges because \"the alleged threats were made across state lines and victims are located in California.\"Harris attempted to buy a gun in early November, but was denied, Herold said.\"Based on a protection order that was issued in the state of California, there was a national database that included a provision that he was not allowed to purchase or possess a firearm. Based on that, we believe at this point -- and again, it's early in the investigation -- that was the basis for the denial when he attempted to purchase the firearm,\" said US Attorney Cole Finegan. Boulder Police previously made contact with the suspect last October and are still reviewing that incident. No charges were filed, the chief said.Threats allegedly made against UCLA staff and studentsUCLA moved classes on Tuesday as word of the threats emerged and will return to in-person classes Wednesday, according to a memo sent to students.\"We are greatly relieved to share that law enforcement officers in Colorado have taken into custody the individual who made threats against some members of our UCLA community yesterday,\" Assistant Vice Chancellor Suzanne L. Seplow wrote in a message to students.According to reporting from the Los Angeles Times, Harris sent email threats to students and faculty members. Leaders of the school's philosophy department, where the former lecturer had worked, warned students and faculty about the threats toward the department, according to emails from the department to students and faculty that the Times obtained.At least 9 HBCUs get bomb threats on the first day of Black History MonthThe messages included a link to his YouTube video and a manifesto outlining threats, reported UCLA's student newspaper, the Daily Bruin, citing communications from the philosophy department to students and faculty. It was not clear whether the Harris sent any direct threats of a mass shooting, the paper said.\"I want to inform you that the UCLA Police Department is aware of a concerning email and posting sent to some members of the UCLA community today and we are actively engaged with out-of-state law enforcement and federal agencies at this time. We will update our Bruin community later this evening as we learn more,\" UCLA Vice Chancellor Michael Beck said Monday night in an Instagram post.Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore said police had contact with the person last spring and it involved the mental evaluation unit.UCLA's shift to remote learning came on the same day several historically Black colleges and universities had to lock down or postpone classes because of bomb threats.

        "content": "(CNN)Ukrainians face an increasingly desperate situation on the ground as Russian forces hit the capital and fresh targets across the country, despite both nations acknowledging signs of progress in ongoing negotiations. A theater where hundreds of people had taken shelter in the besieged southern city of Mariupol was bombed on Wednesday, according to local authorities, as hundreds of thousands of people remain trapped in the coastal Ukrainian city that has been encircled for weeks by Russian forces.The word \"children\" was spelled out on two sides of the theater before it was struck, according to satellite images.Northern cities have come under increased attack, including the capital Kyiv, with two people injured in the shelling of a 12-story residential building early Wednesday.In the nearby Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, at least 10 people queueing for bread were killed when Russian forces shelled it on Wednesday, a local official, Vyacheslav Chaus, told Ukrainian television. He said the attack was indicative of Russia's use of indirect fire against civilians. Read MoreDespite this, Russian forces are still \"generally stalled\" near Kyiv, and have not \"made any significant advances\" towards the city from the north, northwest or east of the city, a senior US defense official told reporters Wednesday.War crimes expert: Russian invaders are crossing a lineAs the Russian assault intensifies, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday that Russia's negotiating position in talks between the two countries was becoming \"more realistic,\" a sentiment reiterated by Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who suggested there was \"a certain hope for reaching a compromise,\" in a televised interview to Russian media outlet RBK.But while the United States welcomes \"the sentiments expressed that there is hope, that there is optimism for diplomatic progress,\" it believes Russia must de-escalate for any such progress to actually be achieved, US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Wednesday. Deteriorating situation in 'hell' of MariupolRussian military strikes continue to bombard Mariupol, which has been besieged by Russian forces since the beginning of March. Petro Andruishchenko, an adviser to the mayor of Mariupol, described the bombed theater as the largest shelter \"in number and size\" in the city's center. \"According to preliminary data, more than a thousand people were hiding there,\" he said. \"The probability of getting there to dismantle the rubble is low due to constant shelling and bombing of the city.\"The bombing adds to the city's growing humanitarian crisis. About 350,000 people are trapped in the city and as many as 2,500 civilians have died, Ukrainian officials estimate. Those who remain are without electricity, water and heat. A woman walks past building damaged by shelling in Mariupol on Sunday.Satellite images from Maxar Technologies Monday showed the extent of the damage in Mariupol, including homes smoldering after apparently suffering Russian strikes, a destroyed apartment complex and rising plumes of thick smoke.After weeks of failed attempts to establish safe civilian evacuation corridors, about 20,000 people managed to leave the city on Tuesday, officials say. And on Wednesday, more than 3,000 cars transporting evacuees from Mariupol arrived in the central Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, the head of the regional administration, Oleksandr Starukh, said on his Telegram channel. However, Russian forces also attacked Zaporizhzhia for the first time on Wednesday, hitting a railway station and the area around the botanical garden, Starukh added. A man looks at a burned apartment building that was damaged by shelling in Mariupol on Sunday.In another southern coastal city, the Ukrainian government said it staged a rescue of the mayor of Russian-occupied Melitopol, who was detained by armed men in the city on March 11. Melitopol Mayor Ivan Fedorov was freed as part of a prisoner swap, Ukraine's Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security said in a statement on Wednesday.According to the statement, Fedorov was exchanged for nine Russian soldiers, which the Ukrainians say are \"conscripts,\" born between 2002-2003. Russia has denied sending conscripts to Ukraine.Since Fedorov's detention, newly installed mayor Galina Danilchenko ordered the broadcasting of Russian television channels and attempted to dissolve the city council and instead create a People's Committee.Later Wednesday, a senior advisor to Zelensky said the Ukrainian army is beginning to counterstrike Russian forces in a number of directions. \"This fact is drastically changing the dispositions of the sides,\" Mykhailo Podolyak said in a statement posted to Telegram, adding that the \"Russian administration is trying to find allies whose soldiers would be ready to die on the field.\"NATO 'not as essential'Amid signs of potential progress in Ukrainian-Russian talks, the Kremlin said Wednesday that President Vladimir Putin hadn't spoken to his US counterpart, Joe Biden, since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, but contact between the two leaders can resume if necessary.Vladimir Medinsky, the head of the Russian negotiating delegation, was quoted Wednesday as saying the talks were \"difficult\" and \"slow,\" and that Moscow's objectives in negotiations with Ukraine have not changed.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said there was hope of a compromise in negotiations with Ukraine.Medinsky was quoted by state media RIA Novosti on Wednesday as saying Moscow wants a \"peaceful, free, independent and neutral\" Ukraine. He added that the country should not be a member of NATO or any military bloc. Putin sees NATO's expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a \"hostile act. This week, Zelensky appeared to shift away from his previous demand for NATO membership for UkraineThe Ukrainian President delivered an impassioned speech to members of Congress on Wednesday via videolink, receiving a bipartisan standing ovation both before and after his statement.Showing a graphic video of Russia's attacks on Ukraine, Zelensky repeated his calls for a no-fly zone in Ukraine and made references to Mount Rushmore, the attacks on Pearl Harbor and the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky urged his US counterpart Joe Biden to be \"the leader of peace.\"\"In the darkest time for our country, for the whole Europe, I call on you to do more,\" Zelensky said. \"New packages of sanctions are needed, constantly, every week until the Russian military machine stops. Restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based.\" Olha Stefanishyna, deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration of Ukraine, told CNN the reason why Zelensky did not mention NATO is because it is \"not as essential\" as a no-fly zone and weapons -- and that political aspirations will have to go on hold for now.\"I think that NATO is something which is not as essential as a no-fly zone and more weapons and basically, capability to defend ourselves,\" she told CNN from a secure location in Kyiv. \"But now basically it's not about politics, it's about survival,\" she added. Stefanishyna said Putin is failing in the war because \"the chain of command which disinforms him, and the senior management around, shows that they know nothing about our nation.\"\"I'm absolutely sure that he's uncomfortable in every moment that he's sitting in his bomb shelter,\" she said, adding, \"he fails in each of his assessments.\"While US officials say the White House does not support instituting a no-fly zone over Ukraine or supplying the Ukrainian Air Force with new fighter aircraft, Biden appeared to shift his stance on Putin. \"I think he is a war criminal,\" Biden said to reporters after remarks at the White House on Wednesday. He and other government officials had previously stopped short of saying war crimes were being committed in Ukraine, citing ongoing investigations into whether that term could be used.CNN's Tim Lister, Oleksandra Ochman, Vasco Cotovio, Sam Kiley, Kostan Nechyporenko and Gianluca Mezzofiore contributed to this report.",

There is widespread bipartisan support among US lawmakers for aid to Ukraine, and just last week Congress approved an emergency aid package with $13.6 billion in humanitarian, defensive and economic assistance to the embattled country. In addition to that, Zelensky recently pressed President Joe Biden during their latest call for more sanctions to further squeeze Russia, CNN has learned.Read MoreAccording to multiple sources familiar with the call, Zelensky specifically asked Biden for further efforts to cut off Russia from international trade and to continue targeting the Russian elite, as the US has continued to add more oligarchs and their families to its sanctions list. Zelensky also mentioned closing off Russia's access to international waterways during the call.In their letter to lawmakers, Pelosi and Schumer reaffirmed US support for Ukraine amid the war. \"The Congress remains unwavering in our commitment to supporting Ukraine as they face (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's cruel and diabolical aggression, and to passing legislation to cripple and isolate the Russian economy as well as deliver humanitarian, security and economic assistance to Ukraine,\" they wrote.\"We look forward to the privilege of welcoming President Zelenskyy's address to the House and Senate and to convey our support to the people of Ukraine as they bravely defend democracy,\" the two top congressional Democrats said.

        "content": "(CNN)Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who held up popular bipartisan anti-lynching legislation in the Senate last Congress, announced Tuesday that he now supports and has signed on as a co-sponsor of a new version of the bill.The updated version of the legislation -- known as the Emmett Till Antilynching Act of 2022 -- was introduced in the Senate this week by Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey. The Senate bill is identical to companion legislation introduced by Democratic Rep. Bobby Rush of Illinois that the House passed on Monday. Since the House has already passed the measure, once the Senate takes up and passes the bill, it will be sent to President Joe Biden to be signed into law. Paul's support for the new version of the bill will likely pave the way for its passage in the Senate. Senate Democratic leadership hopes to pass the legislation soon by unanimous consent, but the timing is still uncertain.The Emmett Till Antilynching Act of 2022 would designate lynching as a federal hate crime under existing statues and is co-sponsored by Paul and the Senate's three Black senators Booker; Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina; and Raphael Warnock, Democrat of Georgia.The legislation is named in honor of 14-year-old Emmett Till, who was brutally murdered in a racist attack in Mississippi in 1955, an event that drew national attention to the atrocities and violence that African Americans faced in the United States and became a civil rights rallying cry.Read MorePaul previously held up an earlier version of the bill, arguing in 2020 that he wanted it \"to be stronger.\" In a statement on Tuesday in which he urged swift passage of the updated legislation, Paul said, \"Strengthening the language of this bill has been my goal all along, and I'm pleased to have worked with Senators Cory Booker and Tim Scott to get this right and ensure the language of this bill defines lynching as the absolutely heinous crime that it is.\"At the time Paul originally held up the anti-lynching bill in 2020, Senate supporters had hoped to pass the measure by unanimous consent in a show of widespread support. It only takes the objection of one senator out of 100, however, to stall a bill if it is brought up via unanimous consent.  Sen. Rand Paul speaks to members of the press in September 2017 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. Paul explained his position on the bill at the time by saying, in part, \"I don't think it's a good idea to conflate someone who has an altercation, where they had minor bruises, with lynching. We think that's a disservice to those who were lynched in our history, who continue to have, we continue to have these problems. And I think it's a disservice to have a new 10-year penalty for people who have minor bruising. We've tried to exclude that part from the bill, and we've been working with the authors to try to make the bill better.\"Passage of the bill is a long-sought goal of advocates, who have been working for years to secure its approval in Congress.Booker said in a statement on Tuesday, \"The effort to pass anti-lynching legislation has spanned more than a century. After 200 failed attempts, Congress is now finally prepared to reckon with America's history of racialized violence.\" Senate passes bill to posthumously award Emmett Till and his mother with Congressional Gold Medal\"I am proud to announce Senators Paul and Warnock as cosponsors of the Emmett Till Antilynching Act. Their support underscores the bipartisan backing that we have to finally meet this moment and help our nation move forward from some of its darkest chapters,\" he said.Rush said in a statement following House passage of the bill earlier this week, \"The failure of Congress to codify federal antilynching legislation \u2014 despite more than 200 attempts since 1900 \u2014 meant that 99 percent of lynching perpetrators walked free. Today, we take a meaningful step toward correcting this historical injustice.\"\"I am immensely proud of this legislation, which will ensure that the full force of the U.S. federal government will always be brought to bear against those who commit monstrous acts of hatred,\" Rush said.",

        "content": "(CNN)Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds went after President Joe Biden over rising inflation, foreign policy and the Democratic Party's handling of the pandemic in the Republican response to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address on Tuesday evening.Reynolds outlined a lengthy list of GOP criticisms, arguing that reckless government spending has triggered inflation, that Democrats have mishandled the pandemic by imposing overly restrictive mandates and that Biden has projected weakness on the world stage.\"Instead of moving America forward, it feels like President Biden and his party have sent us back in time,\" Reynolds said.On foreign policy, the Iowa Republican called the US withdrawal from Afghanistan under Biden's watch \"disastrous.\" Referencing the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Reynolds called for unity and solidarity with Ukraine, but argued, \"we shouldn't ignore what happened in the run-up to Putin's invasion.\" \"Weakness on the world stage has a cost, and the President's approach to foreign policy has consistently been too little too late,\" she said. Read More\"We can't project strength abroad if we're weak at home,\" she said, charging that Biden and his party \"have spent the last year either ignoring the issues facing Americans or making them worse.\" As she lamented high inflation and its impact on Americans, Reynolds said: \"The Biden administration believes inflation is a 'high class problem,' I can tell you it's an everybody problem.\" Reynolds said the American people share the view that \"enough is enough\" on ambitious Democratic spending plans. Reynolds also went after Democrats over their handling of the pandemic nationwide and cited her own record on the issue. The Iowa governor has made a name for herself as a proponent of limiting government mandates amid the pandemic and Republican congressional leaders praised her handling of Covid-19 when they announced she would deliver the GOP response.\"Republican governors faced the same Covid-19 virus head on, but we honored your freedoms and saw right away that lockdowns and school closures, they came with their own significant costs; that mandates weren't the answer,\" she said. \"What happened and is still happening to our children over the last two years is unconscionable: learning loss, isolation, anxiety, depression. In so many states, our kids have been left behind and many will never catch up,\" she added. Reynolds signed legislation into law last year that blocks mask mandates from being implemented in K-12 schools and prohibits cities and counties from requiring facial coverings in businesses. She also signed a bill into law last year that grants unemployment benefits to those who lose their jobs because they refuse to get vaccinated against Covid-19.The speech gave the Iowa governor a prominent national platform to speak to the country and offer up a critique of the Biden administration agenda. It comes as Republicans work to make their case to the American public ahead of pivotal midterm elections that will determine which party controls the House and Senate.Meet the newest Republican rising starIt's Washington tradition for the party locked out of power at the White House to pick a rising star within their ranks to give a rebuttal speech following the President's annual State of the Union. The nationally televised speech serves as a way to counter-program and draw a contrast. At the same time, the format -- the rebuttal is typically delivered straight to a camera -- can prove challenging and comes with a far less dynamic backdrop than the House chamber, where presidents deliver the State of the Union and are greeted by cheers and applause from members of their party.Biden is confronting challenges on a number of fronts, including facing some of the lowest approval ratings of his presidency just months before the critical upcoming midterm elections. The State of the Union also unfolded under the looming threat of the biggest military crisis in Europe since the Cold War as Russia continues its assault on Ukraine after launching an unprovoked attack on the nation.While Democrats hope the State of the Union address will give Biden, and by extension their party, a boost, Republicans are looking to use the opportunity to spotlight what they see as the major flaws and weaknesses in the President's agenda and his tenure to date.

Ted Cruz of Texas on Wednesday offered rare praise for President Joe Biden over sanctions targeting the company behind a controversial pipeline that has become a flashpoint in the intensifying Ukraine-Russia crisis.Biden said Wednesday that he was moving ahead with sanctions on the company in charge of building Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline after blocking such measures last year using a national security waiver.The move is part of a series of penalties the US and its allies have imposed on Russia this week in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's recognition of separatist territories in eastern Ukraine as independent.\"President Biden made the right decision today,\" Cruz said in a statement Wednesday. \"Allowing Putin's Nord Stream 2 to come online would have created multiple, cascading, and acute security crises for the United States and our European allies for generations to come. Today's announcement is critical to preventing such scenarios.\"A release from the senator's office also said Cruz will lift holds that were stalling confirmation of certain State Department nominees following the announcement and \"after engaging with the administration.\"Read MoreIn January, the Senate voted down legislation from Cruz to sanction entities associated with the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.Cruz has argued that the pipeline would empower Putin and allow him to hold dangerous leverage over Europe by controlling the flow of much-needed natural gas there. The Ukrainian government had come out in support of his plan. Cruz argued that if sanctions weren't enforced, it would be existential for Ukraine. The administration decided to move forward with rescinding the national security waiver on Nord Stream 2 after Germany on Tuesday announced that it was halting the certification of the pipeline, an official said. Sanctioning Nord Stream 2's parent company, Nord Stream 2 AG -- a registered Swiss firm whose parent company is the Russian gas giant Gazprom -- is effectively a death knell to the project, the official added.The move marks a significant shift in the administration's policy toward Nord Stream 2, which had previously been to sanction some of the smaller entities involved in the project, including some Russian companies and ships that have been helping in the construction, but to hold off on sanctioning Nord Stream 2 AG and its CEO, Matthias Warnig.Analysis: Trump sides with Putin as Biden tries to stop a war Cruz is now urging further action by the administration. \"Today's announcement should be followed by additional steps inside the Biden administration and in Congress to permanently lock in sanctions,\" he said in his statement on Wednesday. \"Our Ukrainian allies are on the front lines this very moment bravely facing down Russian forces. For months they have been pleading with us to help them by, first, locking in exactly these sanctions on Nord Stream 2 and, second, providing them with the lethal aid they need to defend themselves,\" Cruz said. \"President Biden has now taken positive steps in both areas, but much more still needs to be done to deter and counter the threat that Putin poses to our allies in Ukraine and across Europe.\"CNN's Ted Barrett and Natasha Bertrand contributed to this report.",

Kim Reynolds will deliver the Republican response to President Joe Biden's upcoming State of the Union address.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy announced on Tuesday that Reynolds will give the Republican address to the nation from Des Moines, Iowa, after the conclusion of Biden's speech. His remarks are scheduled to take place next week on Tuesday, March 1.  The speech will give Reynolds a prominent national platform to speak to the country and counter Biden's message. It comes as Republicans work to make their case to the American public ahead of pivotal midterm elections that will determine which party controls the House and Senate. In a preview of one of the themes the Iowa governor is likely to touch on in her rebuttal speech, McConnell and McCarthy both praised her handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has drawn national attention and sparked controversy and push back from Democrats.Reynolds signed legislation into law last year that blocks mask mandates from being implemented in K-12 schools and prohibits cities and counties from requiring facial coverings in businesses. She also signed a bill into law last year that grants unemployment benefits to those who lose their jobs because they refuse to get vaccinated against Covid-19.Read More\"She handled COVID by choosing freedom over lockdowns and personal responsibility over mandates -- leading to real economic recovery from the pandemic,\" McCarthy said in a statement. \"She fought COVID without forgetting common sense and protected Iowans' health and their rights at the same time,\" McConnell said. \"I am thrilled the American people will hear directly from Gov.

        "content": "(CNN)The Senate took a significant step in recent days to help former military service members suffering from toxic burn pit exposure by passing a bill to expand access to health care for post-9/11 combat veterans.It's not yet clear though when burn pit legislation might get to the President's desk to be signed into law, and advocates say more still needs to be done for veterans to address the issue of toxic exposure.Burn pits were used to incinerate and burn waste, hazardous material, and chemical compounds at military sites throughout Iraq and Afghanistan. A 2020 member survey by the advocacy organization Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America found that 86 percent of respondents were exposed to burn pits or other toxins. The bill passed by the Senate on Wednesday would expand the window of eligibility for health care for post-9/11 combat veterans from five to 10 years after discharge from military service, and provide a one-year open enrollment period for any post-9/11 combat veterans who are outside that ten-year window.Among other provisions, the bill would also require the Department of Veterans Affairs to implement clinical screenings for veterans to look for potential exposure to toxic substances and symptoms commonly associated with exposure. Read MoreThe Senate bill had bipartisan backing and was introduced by Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, and the top Republican on the panel, Jerry Moran of Kansas. The bill is the first part of a three-step, bipartisan approach the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee is undertaking in an effort to address the issue of toxic exposure for veterans. The committee is currently working on the second phase of the effort with a goal of having it ready for Senate floor action in the coming months. On the other side of the Capitol, Rep. Mark Takano, a California Democrat who chairs the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, has introduced a bill with bipartisan support called the Honoring our PACT Act that aims to improve health care and benefits for veterans exposed to toxic substances. Surviving combat only to die at home: Retired Staff Sgt. Wesley Black is picking out his coffin at 35 years old Among a range of provisions, the House bill would put in place \"a presumption of service connection for 23 respiratory illnesses and cancers related to burn pits and airborne hazards exposure,\" according to a fact sheet from the House Veterans' Affairs Committee.Since the House bill is not identical to the legislation passed by Senate, it is not yet clear what lawmakers will do to get a measure to the President's desk and the bills may need to be reconciled at some point in the future. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi highlighted the House bill as an \"important initiative\" in a letter to House Democrats in January detailing the upcoming legislative agenda for the chamber. After the Senate passed its bill this week, some advocates were quick to say more needs to be done. Jeremy Butler, CEO of the group Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, told CNN's Brianna Keilar this week, \"The bill that just passed through the Senate basically does about a third of what we were asking for and unfortunately, that's because health care is expensive, benefits are expensive. But when you are sick and dying from rare cancers, that's what you need.\" \"This is a small first step,\" he said. \"It moves the ball legislatively down the line, but it doesn't get to where we need as veteran's groups.\" Tester and Moran celebrated the Senate bill's passage this week as one step closer to ensuring veterans get the benefits they need and deserve.\"This is a big bill, an important bill and it does right by our veterans in this country,\" said Tester ahead of the bill's passage on the Senate floor.Jon Stewart says Congress is abandoning veterans who inhaled toxic burn pit fumesMoran added that he's heard from numerous veterans in his state and across the country who are sick or dying from the effects of toxic exposure caused by burn pits. \"Addressing the needs of veterans exposed to burn pits cannot wait. This legislation can be life-saving for those exposed or suffering,\" he said in a speech on the Senate floor.\"When our men and women in uniform go into harm's way on our behalf, we owe it to them to take care of them when they come home for whatever injuries are incurred during their service,\" he said.Comedian and political commentator Jon Stewart, who has been a longtime advocate for 9/11 first responders and victims, has been a high-profile figure in the effort to get help for veterans who have been exposed to burn pits.  \"The bottom line is our country exposed our own veterans to poison for years, and we knew about it, and we did not act with urgency and appropriateness,\" said Stewart last month at a virtual roundtable with the House Veterans' Affairs Committee. \"And therefore, we've lost men and women who served this country. They've died out of our inaction.\"CNN's Paul LeBlanc and Allen Kim contributed to this report.",

But \"in the meantime, both sides should come to an agreement to make sure ... the continuing resolution, the short-term funding of the government, is passed by this chamber and avoid any even hint of a government shutdown,\" he said.The House of Representatives voted last week on a bipartisan basis to pass a short-term funding bill, known as a continuing resolution, to extend funding through March 11. Now, the Senate must also pass the measure before it can be sent to President Joe Biden's desk to be signed into law. The expectation on Capitol Hill is that neither party wants a shutdown and the extension will pass the Senate before the deadline. But some Republicans are making demands tied to the vote. Read MoreA group of six conservative senators is warning they will oppose expedited passage of the stopgap bill to fund the government unless they get a vote to defund the remaining vaccine mandates the Biden administration imposed. GOP Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Roger Marshall of Kansas, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Mike Braun of Indiana, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas signed onto a letter suggesting they won't agree to a quick vote on the stopgap bill without an agreement for a vote on an amendment defunding enforcement of vaccine mandates. \"We will continue to stand against these mandates until they are discontinued in ambition, design, and practice,\" they wrote. \"For that reason, we are writing to let you know that we will not consent to a time agreement that eases passage of the Continuing Resolution ... now before the Senate absent an agreement to allow for a roll call vote on an amendment that defunds the enforcement of these vaccine mandates for the spending period covered by the CR.\"A similar scenario played out back in December, but the standoff ended with an agreement to hold votes on a stopgap bill as well as a GOP amendment to prohibit the use of federal funding for Covid-19 vaccine mandates, which ultimately failed.The vote, however, failed with two Republican absences. With Democrats down a member -- Sen. Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico is absent after a stroke -- another vote could be tight. Democrats have not announced if they would give Republicans a vote at all.At a news conference on Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell dismissed concerns about the likelihood of a government shutdown if the House-approved stopgap bill is not passed by the Senate this week. \"As is often the case, we'll process a few amendments before doing the short term CR,\" the Kentucky Republican said. \"I think it'll all be worked out. There's no danger of a government shutdown.\"This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.CNN's Morgan Rimmer and Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)A push for swift passage of a sweeping bill with bipartisan support to overhaul the US Postal Service's finances hit a snag Monday evening in the Senate. Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, objected to a unanimous consent request from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to make a technical fix to the bill. Scott argued that there are issues with the legislation and that the Senate should slow down and work to improve it. As a result, the Senate was not able to proceed to a planned vote to advance the bill Monday night. Schumer said that being unable to immediately make the technical fix will delay the bill, but vowed that the Senate will eventually pass it. Now, absent an agreement to speed up the process, the Senate will have to restart the procedure needed to set up a final vote on the legislation in the chamber. It's not yet clear when a final passage vote will take place. The USPS reform bill has bipartisan support and passed the House last week by a vote of 342 to 92. The bill seeks to overhaul the Postal Service's finances to help shore up its financial footing and allow it to modernize its service.   Read More\"I absolutely support getting something done to reform the Postal Service and ensure it's more accountable to taxpayers and consumers,\" Scott said. He added, \"The Senate should carefully and thoughtfully consider this bill. We should take all appropriate steps to make sure we get this right. The Senate has simply not been afforded the opportunity to do that.\"Schumer responded by saying that the USPS reform bill will pass the Senate, but the objection will \"delay the bill,\" forcing the chamber to go through an \"elaborate\" floor process. Schumer continued to say, \"It's regrettable and it's sad. There's good news though. Even though this will delay the bill, we will pass it. We will have to just go through this elaborate process, the old fashioned and often discredited rules of the Senate that the senator from Florida's employing. We'll have to use them. But we will pass this bill because America needs it.\"Democratic Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan said he expects that the bill will pass sometime after the Senate returns from its upcoming recess next week. \"It'll happen after the break,\" he said, noting they will \"take it up as quick as we can.\"\"There's strong support to take it up,\" he said. \"The momentum is there. The support is there. This was just a hiccup basically.\"Schumer has been calling for swift passage in the Senate, but the majority leader said earlier on Monday that he planned to try to make a technical fix to the postal service reform bill later in the day by unanimous consent and hoped that Republicans would not block the change. Schumer described the fix as needed to correct \"a small clerical error made by the House of Representatives when they sent their bill to the Senate\" and said that \"it has nothing to do with the substance of the bill.\"CNN's Ted Barrett and Paul LeBlanc contributed to this report.",

Now lawmakers will have to negotiate and agree on the specifics of the spending package and work to pass it ahead of a March 11 deadline.Government funding is currently set to expire on February 18, but the House voted on Tuesday to pass a stopgap bill to extend funding until March 11, giving negotiators more time to reach a broader deal. The Senate must next take up the short-term funding bill, known as a continuing resolution, before it can be sent to President Joe Biden's desk.  Senate Appropriations Chairman Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, said in a statement on Wednesday announcing the agreement that lawmakers have \"reached a strong, bipartisan agreement that will allow us to make significant investments in the American people and our communities,\" and added, \"I look forward to crafting a bill that will receive strong support in both Chambers in the coming weeks.\"House Appropriations Chair Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, said in a statement released along with Leahy's, \"I am pleased that we have reached agreement on a framework, which will allow our subcommittees to get to work finalizing an omnibus,\" a reference to a broader spending package.Read MoreSen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, the top Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee, told reporters later Wednesday afternoon that they had an \"understanding\" but they \"haven't worked out all the particulars.\"\"I believe we're going to have a good bill,\" he said. \"I will be happy for defense, and other people are going to be happy for other things, but that's the nature of a bipartisan agreement.\" \"We have made a big step,\" he added.Asked about the issue of parity between defense and nondefense funding, which has been a prominent issue in efforts to reach a deal, Shelby replied, \"We won't have a bill until we have parity.\"There is bipartisan agreement that a broader funding deal is necessary as well as bipartisan concern over the limitations imposed on federal entities if the government is forced to continue operating under stopgap measures, especially at a crucial time for both domestic and foreign policy amid the Covid-19 pandemic and growing fears over a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine.",

        "content": "(CNN)Pope Francis on Wednesday said bishops debating whether to deny communion to public figures who support abortion rights, such as President Joe Biden, should make their decisions from a \"pastoral\" viewpoint and not a political one.\"The problem is not theological, it's pastoral,\" Francis told reporters while traveling from Slovakia to Rome on Wednesday. \"How we bishops deal with this principle. We must be pastors, also with those who are excommunicated. Like God with passion and tenderness. The Bible says so.\"His comments come amid a simmering debate within the US Catholic Church over granting communion to Catholic politicians who support abortion rights, including the nation's second Catholic President. Biden had been denied the sacrament in the run-up to the election and the issue drew new attention in June when the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops proceeded with a plan that could deny communion to such public figures, setting up a potential public rebuke of the President.By a vote of 168 to 55, with six abstentions, the bishops had gone forward with plans for a report on the meaning of the Eucharist in the church. The vote is part of a longer process, and the Vatican would have to approve any action on behalf of the bishops.Catholics for Choice, a liberal Catholic group that advocates for abortion rights, said at the time that it was \"profoundly saddened\" by the vote and condemned using the Eucharist \"as a weapon of punishment.\"Read More\"In a country and church already riven with tension and division, today the bishops chose to be partisan instead of pastoral, cruel rather than Christ-like,\" the group said. \"They have chosen to disobey Jesus's command to 'feed one another,' but everyday U.S. Catholics -- 67 percent of whom oppose withholding Communion and other Sacraments from supporters of abortion rights -- will continue to know better and do better.\"An abortion rights advocate and the first Catholic US president in nearly 60 years, Biden displays a devotion to regular religious services not seen from recent presidents, who were professed Christians but intermittently attended church or worshipped privately while in office.He married his late first wife, Neilia, in a Catholic church, attends weekly Mass, and peppers his political speech with quotes from Scripture, Catholic hymns and references to the nuns and priests he learned from in school.Pew surveys show more than half of US Catholics favor abortion rights and most American Catholics do not believe Biden should be refused communion.\"The pastor knows what to do. In every moment that he leaves the church's pastoral path he immediately becomes a politician,\" Francis said Wednesday.",

        "content": "A version of this story appeared in the March 18 edition of CNN's Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on Britain's royal family. Sign up here.  London (CNN)If you can't answer the question in this week's headline straight away, it probably says more about her than you. She's done so much over such a long period of time, it can be hard to quantify and there simply is no one else comparable.Queen Margrethe of Denmark is also long-serving and widely admired by her subjects but Elizabeth's reign has been longer and she has significantly more subjects.Perhaps we should first ask what the primary role of a monarch is?It isn't to serve for as long as possible; it's to serve well and leave the throne in a stronger position than when you inherited it. In that regard, Elizabeth has outperformed against all odds. Read MoreShe has reigned during a period of change that threatened the monarchy on many fronts. The media revolution put a largely unaccountable institution under unprecedented scrutiny and took away some of the mystique that made it so intriguing. That came with a loss of deference in wider society, which made the monarchy appear even more aloof and unrelatable. But the Queen has a unique ability to turn threats into opportunities and she embraced the media and used it to connect with her subjects, most famously by inviting cameras to film her on walkabouts and among the people. She televised the Christmas message and in doing so inserted herself into the most intimate family moment of the British year. She had an official social media account before any of her grandchildren. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh drive past children in Sabina Park, Kingston, during their visit to Jamaica in 1953. But Elizabeth's greatest counterstrike has to be the Commonwealth. When she acceded to the throne, her empire -- once the largest on Earth -- was collapsing. Country after country voted for independence and many saw it as the beginning of the end of the entire institution of monarchy. Elizabeth, then still in her 20s, stopped the rot by throwing herself behind a fledgling group her father had overseen for post-colonial nations. The Queen made the Commonwealth a priority and, under her stewardship, it has grown from eight members to 54 today. Why does that matter? Because it changed the narrative. As quickly as she was losing authority with a collapsing power base, she was regaining it as the figurehead of an association of independent states. She kept her international footprint and modernized at the same time.The Queen opens the 2011 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth, Australia.When she passes the crown to Charles, it will be less vulnerable than it was when she received it and that has to be her greatest achievement. The Queen's long-held wish to ensure the Commonwealth goes from strength to strength with Charles at its helm was granted in 2018, when the body named him as its next head. His ascension into the role was not guaranteed, as the British King or Queen is not automatically Head of the Commonwealth -- member countries choose who takes on the position. Since then, Charles has increasingly placed the modern Commonwealth at the forefront of his work as he prepares for his own reign. He is progressively taking on more Commonwealth responsibilities on his mother's behalf, like when he led the family on Monday at this week's Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey. To coincide with the day, he also launched climate action scholarships for students from small island nations, many of which are part of the Commonwealth.  Prince Charles and Camilla arrive for the Commonwealth Day Service at Westminster Abbey.Charles is also set to represent the Queen at a rescheduled meeting of the Commonwealth Heads of Government in Kigali, Rwanda in late June. It was supposed to have been held in June 2020 and was postponed twice amid coronavirus. In a statement Monday, Charles said it was \"more important than ever\" for members to come together as the world continues to recover from the pandemic. \"As a family of some 2.6 billion people from fifty-four nations across six continents, the Commonwealth represents a rich diversity of traditions, experience and talents which can help to build a more equal, sustainable and prosperous future,\" he added.But don't expect any sort of handover soon. The Queen may not have been well enough to attend this week's event, but in a message from Windsor she dispelled any suggestion that she might step down: \"In this year of my Platinum Jubilee, it has given me pleasure to renew the promise I made in 1947, that my life will always be devoted in service.\"WHAT YOU SAIDThank you to those who sent in your thoughts on the future of Buckingham Palace. Many of the responses suggested the royals should lean in more on the tourism option, with a couple of folks even suggesting a hotel or bed and breakfast. Now, that would be an experience!Here are a few other answers:Michelle suggested transforming it fully into a \"museum displaying the history of England and the monarchy.\"Mary Beth recalled visiting the palace during the very first year it opened to the public. She suggested opening some of the areas that the Queen has used privately in recent decades, like various state rooms, ballrooms and perhaps her bedroom? \"Let 'common people' feel as if we had been let into the lives of the royals, especially the royal who has reigned the longest of any of them,\" she explained.Meanwhile, Carmine suggested a completely different approach -- turn it into affordable housing. \"It's had its day and is time to use it for something functional for the populace,\" Carmine said. (Editor's note: Submissions have been edited for brevity.)IN THE ROYAL DIARYWilliam and Kate attend a traditional dinner in Funafuti, Tuvalu during the couple's Diamond Jubilee tour of the Far East in September 2012.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will be making final preparations to depart on their first official joint overseas trip since the start of the pandemic. Their royal tour of the Caribbean to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee year will start in Belize on Saturday before continuing to Jamaica and the Bahamas over the course of the week.It may be a tricky tour for the couple, who are visiting the region amid growing republican debate over the royal family's relevance in several countries.Kensington Palace said William and Kate \"are keen to understand more about the impact that the pandemic has had across the Caribbean, and how communities have pulled together to respond.\" The visit will also celebrate the Queen's legacy in the countries, while touching on themes close to their hearts, including the environment, mental health and early childhood.WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING?Queen joins cultural boycott of Russia.The Royal Collection is reportedly withholding three swords bound for display in Moscow. The Queen's art collection had agreed to lend the 17th-century weapons to Moscow Kremlin Museums for an exhibition focused on dueling. However, permission was withdrawn in mid-February as Russia's troops gathered on Ukraine's borders prior to its unprovoked invasion of the country. \"A decision to postpone a loan of three swords from the Royal Collection to the Kremlin Museums in Moscow was made in mid-February,\" a Royal Collection Trust spokesperson told the Guardian. The museum announced the exhibition, which was due to open on March 4, had been postponed indefinitely. \"The core of the project consists of exhibits from European museums, which were forced to withdraw them before the time due to the geopolitical situation,\" it said in a statement on its website. BBC settles with Diana's former aide.The British Broadcasting Corporation has apologized \"unreservedly\" to Patrick Jephson, private secretary to the late Princess of Wales, over the methods journalist Martin Bashir used to secure his explosive Panorama interview more than 26 years ago. In the 1995 world exclusive, Diana confirmed Prince Charles' relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles and described how she believed royal life had made her bulimic. Retired judge John Dyson found Bashir forged documents falsely suggesting palace staff were being paid to spy on the princess in order to get Diana to speak to him, according to an independent investigation published last year. In a statement, the BBC said it \"accepts and acknowledges that serious harm was caused to Commander Jephson as a result of the circumstances in which the 1995 interview with Diana, Princess of Wales was obtained, which have become apparent as a result of the Dyson Report. The BBC apologises unreservedly to Commander Jephson for the harm caused to him and has paid his legal costs.\" The statement added that the corporation had paid \"a substantial sum in damages, which he intends to donate in full to British charities nominated by him.\" Jephson described the settlement as a \"relief\" and expressed his gratitude to Dyson and journalists for bringing \"the truth to light,\" according to Britain's PA Media news agency. Princess Diana with her private secretary, Patrick Jephson, in 1989Sussexes continue their support of Ukraine.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have made several donations to on-the-ground organizations to support the people of Ukraine, according to a statement on their non-profit Archewell Foundation website on Friday. Aid from the couple has gone to refugee agency HIAS, mine clearance organization the HALO Trust and a coalition of Ukrainian media supported by the Are We Europe organization. \"All of us at Archewell have been inspired by the work these organizations have taken on -- and also by the stories from those on the frontlines,\" the statement read. Separately, the HALO Trust revealed Prince Harry recently spoke to two staffers, Olesia and Maryna, based in Ukraine. During the call, Harry praised their work, saying they are \"saving lives every single day.\" He added: \"I know that you're going to continue doing the work that is so desperately needed for HALO, for your families and your country.\" Watch some of their conversation below:\"You are saving lives every single day.\" - Prince Harry, The Duke of SussexOlesia & Maryna are working on the ground in Ukraine with HALO to help keep families safe.

Well, the shots taken by fashion photographer Paolo Roversi back in November are heading on a little tour of Great Britain.They are now part of the permanent collection of the National Portrait Gallery, of which Kate is patron. But with the institution closed for redevelopment until next year, the portraits are being sent for display at venues close to Kate's heart. The tour is part of the gallery's \"Coming Home\" project, which sees pieces \"travel to towns and cities across the UK, providing communities with the opportunity to see iconic works locally,\" it said in a statement.Kate helped select the venues for her portrait tour, the gallery said. The black-and-white shot of the duchess looking to the left is to be displayed at St. James the Less Church in the village of Pangbourne, southeast England, from March 22 to April 5. It will then be shown at the nearby Reading Museum from April 7 to June 4. The church, the statement said, \"has welcomed the Middleton family as parishioners over several generations and the Reading Museum was chosen due to its proximity to the Royal Berkshire Hospital, where The Duchess was born.\"Three portraits released by Kensington Palace to celebrate the Duchess of Cambridge's 40th birthdayThe portrait of the duchess in a striking red gown is set for the Wardlaw Museum at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland, where the duchess famously met her future husband while they were studying.Meanwhile, the other black-and-white portrait of Kate smiling broadly at the camera is headed to Oriel M\u00f4n in Anglesey, Wales, where the Cambridges lived in the first years of their marriage, for display between July 16 and October 22.Nicholas Cullinan, director of the National Portrait Gallery, said the institution was \"delighted\" to be sending the portraits to locations of significance to the duchess. He described her as \"a very committed\" patron who has a \"great interest in photography and portraiture.\"ANNOUNCEMENTSPrince Harry to miss grandfather's service.The Duke of Sussex will not return to the UK at the end of this month. A spokesperson for Prince Harry confirmed the royal will miss the thanksgiving service for his late grandfather, Prince Philip, which is due to be held at Westminster Abbey on March 29. However, the duke hopes to visit his grandmother as soon as possible, the spokesperson added.Despite his absence, Harry will be crossing the Atlantic soon enough. The duke has been brushing up his Dutch skills, according to a tongue-in-cheek promo for his upcoming Invictus Games in The Hague from April 19.

        "content": "A version of this story appeared in the March 11 edition of CNN's Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on Britain's royal family. Sign up here. London (CNN)Think of the Queen and you think of Buckingham Palace. It's up there with the White House as one of the world's most celebrated addresses.Generally, tourists take a cab or a bus, hop off to take a picture of the famous railings, maybe sticking around for the changing of the guard just before lunchtime, and then head on to the next destination on their list. So, why the fascination, especially when most people don't even go inside?They come because it's home to the living, breathing British monarchy and they grew up seeing it in movies and history books.None of that has changed. This is still the Queen's head office but she doesn't stay overnight anymore. She has, to all intents and purposes, moved to what used to be her weekend home at Windsor Castle. Some reports this week have suggested the move is permanent.People on the Long Walk outside Windsor CastleThe Queen's office at Buckingham Palace declined to comment, but a royal source told us she continues to carry out a variety of engagements there and confirmed it remains the central base of the British monarchy.Read MoreThe source also pointed out that the ongoing Buckingham Palace refurb is expected to continue for another five years, and who wants to live in a building site? When we've been behind the scenes, the place is awash with builders, tools and pots of paint -- a world away from the peaceful medieval grandeur of Windsor. Where would you prefer to spend your latter years?The bigger question is what Charles plans to do with the palace. His office rarely comments on matters relating to his own monarchy as it would be insensitive to his mother who is still very much the sovereign. He also prefers life outside the capital. He's passionate about walking and the countryside and spends as much time as possible in the tranquility of his rural residence in the rolling hills of Gloucestershire in the English West Country. If he inherits Buckingham Palace as an office rather than a residence, he may choose to keep it that way.Buckingham Palace continues to attract tourists to its famous gates. Charles could demonstrate his desire for a leaner, more efficient monarchy by opening the building up for wider public use. He could rent it out for events and exhibitions. When you consider Buckingham Palace has 775 rooms, including 19 state rooms, 240 bedrooms and 92 offices, it probably could be used more effectively than it has in the past.But would you, as a tourist, visit an office? Isn't it the idea that the Queen actually lives there that is appealing about the place? She could tweak a curtain or drive out at any moment... that's what makes it so exciting to be there.What do you think Charles should do with the palace? Send us your ideas and we will publish the most interesting ones in next week's newsletter.DON'T MISSNormally the fact that the monarch completed her first in-person appearance after a bout of illness would be front page news over here. However, with the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Ukraine, attention was quite rightly diverted when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stopped by Windsor Castle on Monday.The Queen was all smiles when she caught up with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday.Photographs of the pair in the now-familiar Oak Room showed Trudeau clasping the Queen's hands as they appeared to chat and laugh together. But it was the background that garnered the most attention from the engagement. Eagle-eyed royal-watchers spotted a large bouquet of blue and yellow flowers -- the colors of the Ukrainian flag -- on a table behind the pair. It's been seen by many as a very deliberate choice of set dressing by the monarch to quietly convey her support to the people of Ukraine. It wouldn't be unheard of for the Queen to give subtle hints at her thinking -- she's certainly done it in the past. This latest possible example also follows her \"generous\" but private donation last week to an emergency humanitarian appeal currently operating in the UK.Trudeau journeyed to Europe on Sunday for a week of meetings designed to \"further strengthen Canada's solidarity with our European partners and allies in the face of Russia's unwarranted invasion of Ukraine.\" Following his stop in London, the Canadian Prime Minister -- who himself recently recovered from coronavirus -- traveled on to Latvia, Germany and Poland.

Organizations are on the ground in Ukraine and neighboring countries to help with shelter, food, water and additional aid. Head here to find out how to help. WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING?William caught up in social media storm. What exactly did he say about war in Europe?The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on Wednesday came laden with homemade brownies and granola bars from Kensington Palace for volunteers at a Ukrainian cultural center in London, which has been collecting donations for the war-torn nation. The couple learned about how the Ukrainian Social Club is coordinating relief packages, handling the generous outpouring of public offerings it has received and the distribution challenges in funneling aid back to Ukraine. The royal couple conveyed their shock at Russia's unfolding invasion and revealed their children have been asking them about the conflict. \"Everyone is horrified by what they are seeing. It's really horrifying. The news every day, it's just, it's almost unfathomable,\" William said. \"For our generation, it's very alien to see this happening in Europe. But we're all right behind you. We're thinking about you ... We feel so useless.\" In the hours after the engagement, \"Prince William\" was trending on social media after the royal's remarks were incorrectly paraphrased by the royal pool journalist, who had filed copy saying William had compared the war in Europe to conflicts in Asia and Africa. The pool system means British reporters take turns covering engagements and share information and photos among the group so that events can be widely reported by all outlets. Once the misheard remarks were distributed through the pool, they were widely used in various publications, before going viral on social platforms. By Thursday afternoon, video of the moment surfaced from broadcaster ITV clarifying William had never made such a reference. Media outlets issued corrections and online articles were removed or amended.William and Catherine chat with volunteers as they pack donations to be sent to Ukraine. Refugees could help Britain's skills shortage, Charles says.The Prince of Wales has spoken of \"enormous benefits\" possessed by many refugees escaping their war-ravaged homelands. Charles was visiting St. Luke's Church in west London on Wednesday to learn more about the Holy Trinity Brompton's Refugee Response program, launched in September to help support Afghan arrivals to the UK. During the visit, Charles told refugees from countries including Afghanistan, Ukraine, Iraq and Iran that he couldn't \"begin to imagine the dreadful conditions\" they had endured to reach the UK. The heir to the throne said he prayed they had been welcomed and that they bring much-needed skills to the country. \"I know so many of you already have qualifications, training in your own countries, and we have enormous skill shortages in this country, where so much of what you can do could be of enormous benefit to it. We are very lucky in many ways to have you and your skills and all you can bring,\" he said.Charles meets refugees during the visit on Wednesday. When Camilla met \"Camilla.\"The Duchess of Cornwall opened the doors of Clarence House Tuesday for a special celebration to mark International Women's Day, welcoming guests to her London residence as president of WOW -- Women of the World Festival. She was met by Jude Kelly, the founder and CEO of the WOW Foundation, before mingling with invitees and taking part in a group photo. Among the guests were Inna Prystaiko, wife of Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, former British Prime Minister Theresa May and Spice Girl Mel B. Camilla also had a bit of a royal run-in when the duchess met her television alter ego, Emerald Fennell, at the event. Fennell portrayed a fictionalized version of a young Camilla in Netflix's most recent season of \"The Crown.\" Rumors about the family's feelings on the hit series have swirled for years but Camilla was nothing but smiles during the encounter. While at the event, she also got the chance to catch up with three female Afghan judges, who were evacuated from the country along with 100 others by the International Bar Association's Human Rights Institute, as the Taliban returned to power last year. \"Their stories, of the humanity behind the headlines, are unbearably moving -- but they must, and they do, have the power to stir us to action, as do the heart-breaking stories from Ukraine of brutal attacks on democracy and freedom,\" the duchess said at the WOW reception.Camilla meets her \"The Crown\" counterpart, actor and award-winning writer-director Emerald Fennell.DID YOU KNOW?Prince Andrew civil sex abuse case is officially over.US District Judge Lewis Kaplan officially dismissed Virginia Giuffre's sexual abuse lawsuit against the Duke of York Tuesday after attorneys for both parties submitted a stipulation to the court asking for a dismissal. David Boies, an attorney for Giuffre, confirmed Prince Andrew had paid the agreed settlement. That dollar figure has not been disclosed. \"The payment was received, the settlement we announced last month has been completed. We are obviously very pleased with the outcome,\" Boies said. CNN has reached out to counsel for Prince Andrew for comment.The parties reached an out-of-court settlement agreement in February, which included Andrew's payment of an undisclosed amount to Giuffre and her charity supporting victims' rights, according to court documents.In the lawsuit, Giuffre alleged Epstein trafficked her and forced her to have sex with his friends, including Andrew, and that the prince was aware she was underage in the US at the time. Andrew has repeatedly denied the allegations against him.

London (CNN)A war in Europe was unimaginable two weeks ago. There's been widespread shock around the world over Russian President Vladimir Putin's merciless and unprovoked attack on Ukraine, and among many in his own homeland.It is at times like these that we look to our own leaders to express how we feel and to respond accordingly. Britain's Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, has risen to the occasion enough for many to forget -- for now at least -- about lockdown parties that led to calls for his resignation.The Queen has been lying low at Windsor Castle as she continues to recover from Covid. She has been well enough to do paperwork and host virtual audiences but little else (more on that later). We learned on Thursday, though, that she was so moved by events in Ukraine she had privately made a \"generous\" donation to the humanitarian appeal from the Disasters Emergency Committee -- a group of 15 leading UK aid charities. Buckingham Palace confirmed the Queen's donation but would not comment further, telling us it was a \"private matter.\"Other members of her family have stepped up in her absence, as is the form these days.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge said in a tweet over the weekend that they \"stand with the President and all of Ukraine's people as they bravely fight for that future.\"Read MoreIn October 2020 we had the privilege to meet President Zelenskyy and the First Lady to learn of their hope and optimism for Ukraine's future.

That's why, as a rule, royals don't cast judgment on foreign heads of state. They're in it for life, unlike transient politicians. Putin, however, has crossed the line on this one for Charles, as he has for most of the Western world.But it was perhaps his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, who best expressed the nation's shock without words, during the couple's visit to a Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral in London on Wednesday.Charles and Camilla wanted to show their support for the Ukrainian community here in London. The pair went to the Cathedral of the Holy Family -- which has become a rallying point for the British Ukrainian community -- where they met the Ukrainian Ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, and his wife, Inna Prystaiko, as well as Bishop Kenneth Nowakowski. On arrival, the royals met children from an associated Ukrainian school and received a traditional offering of bread and salt. The couple also lit a candle and laid sunflowers, Ukraine's national flower, at the altar.Addressing members of the Ukrainian community working to support relief efforts, Charles praised the group for their courage in the face of wanton aggression. He said: \"My wife and I have been deeply moved by everything we've heard today during our visit and, above all, by the extraordinary bravery, generosity and fortitude of the Ukrainian community in the face of such truly terrible aggression. So, if I may say so, our thoughts and prayers, however inadequate they may be, are with all of you at this most critical time.\"During the visit, a camera picked up tears in Camilla's eyes and a journalist from the Royal Rota covering the event reported the duchess \"wept frequently during the engagement and comforted the ambassador's wife, who was also crying.\" NEWS OF THE WEEKThe Queen appears on a screen via videolink from Windsor Castle, during a virtual audience to receive the High Commissioner of Malawi, Dr. Thomas Bisika (not pictured), at Buckingham Palace in London on Thursday.The Queen seems to be on the mend after contracting coronavirus nearly two weeks ago, undertaking a number of video calls this week.On Thursday, she held two virtual audiences from Windsor with the new ambassadors for Trinidad and Tobago and Malawi. Earlier this week, she also welcomed incoming envoys to the UK from Andorra and Chad in video meetings.The palace has been reluctant to give a daily health update but clearly the monarch is feeling well enough to return to virtual engagements. It is understood she will continue with other duties and has some private engagements in her diary.One event that was taken off the books was a diplomatic reception that was due to take place at Windsor Castle on Wednesday. Buckingham Palace said over the weekend the Queen had \"accepted the Foreign Secretary's advice\" to postpone the event. Rather than being related to her health, it's likely UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss made the suggestion in the light of the ongoing crisis facing Ukraine.The next major events the Queen is hoping to attend are the annual Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey on March 14 and a service of thanksgiving for her late husband, Prince Philip, at the same venue on March 29.WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING?Charles celebrates success of Black Britons.The Prince of Wales brought together some of the most influential Black Britons when he hosted a reception for supporters of the Powerlist at Clarence House on Tuesday. The Powerlist is an annual celebration of 100 of the most influential people of African, African-Caribbean and African-American heritage. \"These communities have made and continue to make an incredibly positive difference to society as a whole and, in doing so, have built a real community spirit and cohesion,\" Charles said. The heir to the throne added it was \"particularly pleasing to see the diversity of talent\" recognized by the initiative, from the arts to business, the environment and technology, among other sectors. Charles said the Powerlist -- now in its 16th year -- has helped identify \"expertise and leadership\" that will aid the UK in meeting the challenges it continues to face across society.The Prince of Wales speaks to Baroness Valerie Amos during the Powerlist reception. William and Kate mark St. David's Day in Wales.The Cambridges took a trip to Wales to celebrate St. David's Day, where they were greeted by throngs of well-wishers. The trip was focused on the importance of the agricultural industry, with their engagements centered around how community groups are supporting young people, while also celebrating the region's history. In Abergavenny, they stopped at a goat farm that has supplied milk to local cheesemakers for almost two decades. Meanwhile, in Blaenavon, the pair rolled up their sleeves in the kitchen of a local youth center, where they baked Welsh cakes before playing a game of pool.William and Kate chat with royal supporters at Abergavenny Market.DID YOU KNOW?Meghan praises historic Supreme Court nomination.The Duchess of Sussex weighed in on Ketanji Brown Jackson's historic Supreme Court nomination to become the first Black woman to sit on the highest court in the United States. Meghan spoke to Anita Hill, an American lawyer who became a household name in 1991 when she testified about sexual harassment she allegedly endured from then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, for URL Media. Reflecting on Jackson's nomination, Hill wrote in an op-ed that she wanted to seek the thoughts of others who had \"entered arenas once thought to be inaccessible,\" so she reached out to Meghan. The duchess praised President Joe Biden's pick, telling her \"the civil rights history of tomorrow is being written today.\" Meghan added that Jackson's nomination \"opened new ground for women's representation at the highest level of a judicial system that for too long has tilted against the very community she hails from.\" Read Hill's op-ed here.DON'T MISSConservators handle David Bailey's portrait of Diana.New Diana portrait goes on display.An exhibition opening Friday at London's Kensington Palace will debut a portrait of Princess Diana that's never been seen by the public. Taken by fashion photographer David Bailey in 1988, the image was originally commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery but has remained in Bailey's archive until now. The black-and-white image shows an elegant 27-year-old Diana gazing into the distance, wearing a satin off-the-shoulder gown and a pair of teardrop earrings.Bailey, who has photographed multiple cultural legends, including Andy Warhol, Twiggy and the Beatles, was selected by Diana for his high-contrast lighting and minimalist style. Her choice \"reflected her desire to establish a new photographic identity for herself,\" distinct from the more established forms of royal portraiture, according to a news release from Historic Royal Palaces, the British charity tasked with running six of the UK's palaces. Revealed now after 34 years, the image further solidifies her public reputation as one of the most fashion-forward members of the British royal family.

        "content": "A version of this story appeared in the February 25 edition of CNN's Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on Britain's royal family. Sign up here.  London (CNN)Elizabeth II's health is a big talking point right now, not just because she is elderly but also because Buckingham Palace is releasing so little information about it. So we thought we'd spend this week's edition answering your biggest questions and concerns. Yes, she is still recovering from Covid-19.Last Sunday, the palace announced the 95-year old monarch had tested positive for Covid that same day and was experiencing \"mild, cold-like symptoms.\" It confirmed she was receiving \"medical attention\" and a royal source added that there had been an outbreak of the virus among Her Majesty's team at Windsor.It was made clear though that she was not out of action, as the statement added that she \"expects to continue light duties at Windsor over the coming week.\"Read MoreWhat are \"light duties?\"This is a relatively new term that we are still getting used to, but our sense is that it means paperwork. Mentioning it reassures us that she is still well enough to work on the most important matters of state, such as signing off on new laws.She also found time to send a letter of congratulations to the British Olympic team in the week and offer  condolences to the people of Brazil following the devastating floods in Petr\u00f3polis.The Queen during her last in-person engagement, days before she tested positive for coronavirus But didn't she have to cancel her meetings?She canceled her weekly in-person audience with the Prime Minister on Wednesday but that's because it would have broken Covid regulations at the time, which still required her to isolate. The Queen had a call with Boris Johnson instead.On Tuesday, she postponed an unspecified number of video calls as she continued to experience symptoms and a source told CNN that they would decide on upcoming engagements nearer the time. She also canceled her video calls Thursday but we are told they are being rescheduled.Why can't she do video calls? It may simply be because she doesn't want to appear on camera when she feels unwell, but it also meant we weren't able to see her for ourselves for the whole week.Why is the palace being so secretive?It wouldn't accept that it is being secretive. Aides agree the public has a right to updates on their head of state but they also refuse to give a \"running commentary\" on her medical condition. That's because they believe the family has the same right to patient confidentiality that the rest of us have.The Queen at a reception in Windsor in 2021Would they tell us if it got serious?Well, the palace didn't tell us when she was admitted to hospital last year until it was leaked to the media and even then, it wouldn't specify what she was admitted for. Our reading of that incident was that if there had been a procedure of some sort then we would have been informed as that was the general rule courtiers had for updates on Prince Philip's hospital visits.If it got really serious and the Queen became incapacitated temporarily, we suspect we won't be told anything until the family and the Prime Minister were informed and a formal announcement is made about who will be acting on her behalf.Is Covid her only health issue?No. She also has some sort of mobility issue. At her last in-person audience with senior members of the military, she joked with them that she couldn't move. CNN was told that was probably more to do with feeling stiff rather than an injury or other ailment. It would be more surprising if she didn't feel creaky sometimes given that she's approaching her 96th birthday in April. This week can't have been comfortable for her when she couldn't move around properly and felt like she had a cold. At least she's out of isolation now, or we assume so as the isolation rules were scrapped in England on Thursday.All this is a reminder that Elizabeth isn't superhuman, and instances like this prompt the public to worry. The palace is constantly trying to balance the public's right to updates on a publicly-funded monarch with her desire for some privacy. In reality, the public will always want to know more but it's that mystique that keeps us captivated by royalty, and it's why we eagerly await pictures of her return to work and again keeping the country ticking over. History teaches us she won't be held back for long.DON'T MISSKate wows crowds in Denmark.Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, received the warmest of welcomes from the Danish Royal family in Copenhagen this week as she made her inaugural overseas trip with her organization, The Royal Foundation Center for Early Childhood. Kate was received to Denmark by Queen Margrethe II, who recently marked her 50th year on the throne.The duchess spent her two-day trip learning about the country's approach to childhood development, visiting the LEGO Foundation Playlab at the University College Copenhagen.

Prince Harry filed a complaint against Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) -- the publisher of titles including The Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, a spokesperson for the duke told us this week. Harry's spokesperson did not share any further details on which newspaper is facing litigation or why. CNN has reached out to DMG Media, ANL's parent company, for comment. Prince Harry labeled the British tabloid landscape as \"toxic\" last year in an interview with \"The Late Late Show\" host James Cordon. The fresh lawsuit comes months after Meghan, Duchess of Sussex won her own legal battle with ANL over the publication of a letter she wrote to her estranged father in 2018.

London (CNN)When British newspapers go in for the kill, they don't hold back.On Wednesday, the Sun newspaper splashed the headline: \"His Final Disgrace,\" the Daily Mail called it the \"Duke's Final '\u00a310 million' Humiliation\" and The Daily Star declared him a \"Royal wrong 'un.\" If Prince Andrew had hoped to end the stream of negative headlines coming out of his civil sexual assault case by settling out of court for an undisclosed sum, it didn't work.That's because the UK's media no longer had to wait for a verdict before passing their own judgment on the Duke of York's character. Throughout the case, Andrew has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing but the move has left some wondering why he would settle if he has no memory of ever meeting his accuser Virginia Giuffre -- as he claims. And he previously vowed to clear his name at trial. Neither Andrew nor Giuffre would comment beyond the settlement statement filed with the court, but royal commentators conclude that the prince had to stop the drip-drip of salacious revelations in the Queen's platinum jubilee year, which is meant to be about celebrating -- not berating -- the monarchy. Read MoreThe Queen and Prince Andrew in 2018. The other reason for the relentless headlines lies in the fact that Buckingham Palace isn't dousing the firestorm either, instead redirecting queries to the duke and his legal team. The Queen had already showed how far she was willing to go to distance the institution from her son by stripping him of his remaining military titles and roles last month.With the case over, the lingering queries surround how Andrew is funding the deal, which British media estimates is upwards of \u00a310 million ($13.6 million). More specifically, the bones of contention are over whether the Queen helped foot the bill, and if she did, was public money involved? A flurry of politicians, academics and commentators are demanding transparency over the financial sources behind the settlement.It's inconceivable that the Queen would use the Sovereign Grant -- which comes from the taxpayer -- to pay her son's legal fees. The palace would need to declare it and it would certainly be viewed as a misuse of public money. The institution would be well aware of this and, as such, would not entertain the idea. The problem is that we won't know conclusively until the official accounts are published next year. Andrew talks to his older siblings, Charles and Anne, at the funeral of Patricia Knatchbull, Countess Mountbatten of Burma on June 27, 2017 in London, England. Some have speculated that the Queen and Prince Charles could have contributed using their personal incomes from their private estates and investments. The handling of those finances doesn't need to be publicly revealed, though they do choose to declare some of it.Andrew may have his own money or may have gone to the private sector to secure the funds. At this point, it is just not clear and in the vacuum a narrative of possible wrongdoing is emerging. Until it's made clear where the money has come from, the whole family's finances will be under scrutiny.Labour member of parliament Andy McDonald told the BBC he would be raising the issue in the House of Commons, saying: \"We don't know the precise figure but there is a risk that this will be at the public's expense so we need to have that resolved. We need to know exactly where this money is coming from.\"Mother and son watch the Trooping The Colour parade in 2018.Separately, allegations of corruption at the top of Prince Charles' charitable network resurfaced this week after the Met Police announced it was launching an investigation into an alleged cash-for-honors scandal. A spokesperson for the Prince of Wales referred us to a previous statement, maintaining that he \"had no knowledge of the alleged offer of honors or British citizenship on the basis of donation to his charities.\" Regardless, the investigation couldn't have come at a worse time for the family.Royal finances are notoriously confusing because both public and private money play into them, but the palace does go to great lengths to clarify how taxpayer funds are used. Now it is under pressure to do so sooner rather than later as the questions over how Andrew covered his substantial legal costs will only get louder.WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING? Smiling Queen gets on with the job as sons' woes rumble on.Elizabeth II put on a brave face as scandals continue to roil her children this week. She completed her first in-person engagement since returning to Windsor on Wednesday. The occasion was also her first appearance since her family was caught up in a Covid scare.In a bright floral-patterned dress, the monarch held an audience with the outgoing Defence Services Secretary, Rear Admiral James Macleod, and his successor, Major General Eldon Millar.The Queen's health has been closely scrutinized since late last year when she retreated from public events on advice from doctors to rest after an overnight hospital stay for an undisclosed reason. Fresh concern was renewed in the past few days as multiple family members self-isolated after testing positive for the virus. However, Wednesday's event would suggest the Queen has avoided contracting the virus despite seeing her son Charles \"recently.\"The Queen, who this month marked the 70th anniversary of her accession to the throne, appeared in good spirits throughout the engagement. Standing in the Oak Room at Windsor Castle, she called out \"ha, I'm here!\" with a chuckle as the two secretaries entered the room. Asked how she was, the Queen quipped: \"Well, as you can see, I can't move,\" while gesturing to her leg, with her walking stick in hand. A royal source told CNN the Queen is believed to have been feeling slightly stiff rather than injured or unwell.Britain's Queen Elizabeth II during her first in-person audience since returning to Windsor. The secretaries joked about the palace's tight security presence, revealing they had struggled to get past her dog Candy outside.\"I noticed you've got Candy keeping guard because, as we came down the corridor, she was not going to let us get anywhere near you,\" Macleod said. \"She gave a little growl as we came in,\" Millar added.The Queen responded in surprise, \"Oh really?

        "content": "This is a special edition of CNN's Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on Britain's royal family. Sign up here to receive our newsletter every Friday.  London (CNN)And just like that it's all over. Britain's Prince Andrew, the Queen's second son, has reached a deal with Virginia Giuffre to settle her civil sex abuse lawsuit against him. Giuffre alleges she was trafficked by convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein and forced to perform sex acts with his friends, including the senior royal. She also said the Duke of York had been aware she was underage in the US at the time. Giuffre brought the case last August under the Child Victims Act, a state law enacted in New York in 2019 which temporarily extended the statute of limitations in child sex abuse cases, giving survivors more time to seek justice. Andrew, 61, repeatedly rejected the allegations against him. Just weeks ago, his lawyers had demanded a jury trial to clear their client's name. But now the looming courtroom showdown is off. On Tuesday, the two sides reached an out-of-court settlement for an undisclosed figure. Read MoreIn a letter to federal Judge Lewis Kaplan, the parties stated that while the full financial terms of the agreement would not be revealed, \"Prince Andrew intends to make a substantial donation to Ms. Giuffre's charity in support of victims' rights.\"According to the court document filed by Giuffre's attorneys, the parties plan to file a stipulation of dismissal of the case within 30 days. So, with news of the case's pending conclusion, let's unpack a few things. Andrew has claimed to have no recollection of ever meeting Giuffre or of posing for the infamous photo showing the royal with his arm around the teenager. A photograph appearing to show Prince Andrew with Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre and, in the background, Ghislaine Maxwell.His lawyers have spent months trying to undermine Giuffre, arguing her claims were motivated by money. They wrote in a blistering court filing in October that: \"Giuffre has initiated this baseless lawsuit against Prince Andrew to achieve another payday at his expense.\"And while Andrew neither confirmed nor denied Giuffre's claims in Tuesday's court filing, he has now agreed to a likely multi-million dollar settlement with a woman who leveled grave accusations of sexual abuse against the senior royal. UK newspapers twisted the knife on Wednesday with numerous headlines suggesting the deal amounted to anywhere between \u00a310 and 12 million ($13-$16 million). The Daily Mail splashed with \"Duke's final '\u00a310 million humiliation,\" The Sun newspaper ran with \"His final disgrace,\" while The Daily Telegraph reported \"Queen to help pay for \u00a312m settlement.\"Questions over how Andrew will foot the bill remain. There have been suggestions that the Queen may contribute -- but that could be damaging for the monarch, were it ever to be confirmed. To date, the Queen has largely avoided becoming the target of public anger over the saga that has engulfed her son. She remains revered, and 'the firm' has gone to great lengths to distance itself from the civil suit.The Queen and her son chat at the Windsor Horse Show in 2017.A closer look at the phrasing of the document is also revealing. It states that \"Prince Andrew has never intended to malign Ms. Giuffre's character, and he accepts that she has suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks.\"His team is now recognizing her trauma and praising her bravery at coming forward.\"Prince Andrew regrets his association with Epstein, and commends the bravery of Ms. Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others,\" the document continues.Royals hope for jubilee reset after tumultuous 12 months One of the big criticisms of Prince Andrew has been over his lack of empathy for Epstein's victims. Giuffre's lawyer, David Boies, had provided a view of the case from her perspective in January when he told the BBC it was important to his client that the matter \"be resolved in a way that vindicates her and vindicates the other victims.\" Sigrid McCawley, another attorney for Giuffre, said Tuesday that she was \"very pleased with the resolution\" of the lawsuit. Then there's the question of why this has happened now. The settlement comes at a crucial juncture in the case, as it moved into the discovery stage, during which both sides could demand disclosure of documents and the parties involved would have had to sit for depositions. Andrew was less than a month away from having to give a statement under oath to Giuffre's lawyers, who were reportedly planning to fly to London to question him in person. If ever there was a moment to strike a deal, this was it.Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein (far right) pictured together at the Ascot horse races.CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson says it was \"a significant development and off ramp\" for the duke as with litigation \"you always will have revelations that occur.\"\"In depositions, for example, where you raise your hand and you swear to tell the truth ... in the event that he perjures himself, he opens himself up to some other issues and then obviously it stays in the news,\" he continues.\"Not to mention a legal perspective, where after depositions, after discovery, and you go to court and you could lose, and that's when all types of details may come out that you may not want.\"Jackson thinks the duke was left without any option other than to settle, since letting the case drag on \"would do him no good nor anyone else related to him any good.\"\"I think this was the best option to explore and ultimately to take,\" he adds.However, the end of the lawsuit doesn't mean we'll see the ninth-in-line to the British throne returning to public duties anytime soon. For the former naval officer, that ship has well and truly sailed. His handling of the crisis since Giuffre's allegations first emerged years ago has left his reputation in tatters. The court of public opinion designated him persona non grata after that car-crash interview with the BBC in 2019, during which he was coy about his years-long friendship with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. He said he was at a pizza parlor on the night it is alleged that he had sex with Giuffre. He also said he was medically incapable of sweating, countering allegations from Giuffre that he had perspired profusely before they had sex in 2001, when she was 17. A settlement leaves many of the issues raised in that interview unresolved.And it's important to note that the recently convicted Maxwell is now facing life in prison for sex trafficking. Legal experts say prosecutors could consider continuing their work investigating the crimes of the British socialite and Epstein to determine whether others should be charged -- especially if she decides to cooperate.Prince Andrew has kept a low profile since stepping back from public duties as a senior royal.These days the prince spends much of his time on the Windsor estate and is often surrounded by photographers when he attempts to leave his home. Analysis: Queen left with no choice but to cast Prince Andrew adrift. But is it enough?A Buckingham Palace spokesperson told CNN the palace would not be commenting on the latest developments in the case on Tuesday, once again saying it was a matter for the Duke and his legal team. But the settlement will likely be welcomed within the palace since it means the court case will no longer cast a shadow over the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations this summer. The family has gone to great lengths to distance itself from the scandal surrounding Andrew, with the Queen stripping him of his HRH status as well as his royal patronages and affiliations last month, to make it clear his exile from the royal frontline was permanent.It's worth noting that Andrew still has a constitutional role. He remains a Counsellor of State -- and along with Charles, William and Harry -- could be called on to pick up some of the Queen's duties if she were temporarily incapacitated due to illness or if she was traveling. Street art featuring Prince Andrew is seen in the Shoreditch area of London on July 1, 2020.Andrew's relinquishment of his public-facing royal role doesn't change his counsellor status -- it would take an act of parliament to revoke that.How the prince will move on from this remains to be seen. The carefully-crafted settlement letter states that: \"He pledges to demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims.\" That suggests he might become some sort of campaigner for sex abuse survivors -- but reputation management experts have previously expressed doubt over Andrew's ability to repair his image. And it is unclear just how welcome any offer of help from him would be to charities or support groups.While the prospect of an embarrassing public trial is off the table, by settling he has failed to clear his name, and the damage to his reputation has been done.",

It ultimately concluded that Fawcett, who resigned amid the investigation, had coordinated with so-called fixers over honors for a donor, according to the PA Media news agency in December. Fawcett, who previously served as Charles' valet, had been chief executive since 2018, PA reported. Police officers reached out to the Prince's Foundation regarding its findings and after examining documents provided by the charity alongside existing information, the police's assessment \"determined an investigation will commence.\"A spokesperson for The Prince's Foundation said in a statement that \"it would be inappropriate to comment on an ongoing investigation.\" A source with knowledge of the situation close to the charity told CNN the charity will continue to offer its full cooperation.No arrests or interviews under caution have taken place, the press release said.",

Dubai and London (CNN)Being an heir to the throne isn't what it used to be; now you have to actually work. Once a license to while away the days in indulgent obscurity, it's now about developing your own brand so you're known and relevant when you accede.Prince William's approach was on full display during a busy day of engagements in Dubai this week. He was drafted in by the British government to help promote Brand UK. The royals have long been seen as a unique selling point for the country, and while the family has had its trials and tribulations over the past year, it still exudes stability and strength compared with the chaotic politics of home.What's unique to William is how he's handling his engagements around the core duties.Climate is the issue that resonates most with the young people who will be his subjects one day, and he's made it central to his agenda. Before arriving at Expo 2020 Dubai, he met Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed Al Nahyan, son of the UAE's de facto ruler, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi.They planted new mangrove trees in a park that the local government says will capture more than four times as much carbon as an equivalent-sized rainforest.

If we do nothing, by 2030 we will be speeding towards increasingly devastating planetary and humanitarian crises as a result of our changing climate,\" the prince said.It's the type of message you might expect from a modern royal, using their platform to bring attention to a major public-interest issue. Where William is marking himself out and potentially connecting with the young is that he doesn't stop there. He went on to say: \"If we act now, we will be on a path towards a repaired and regenerated planet that will flourish for generations to come.\"Stark #climate warning from Prince William: \"This is the decisive decade.

Traditionally, that means showing up at charities and events to get them in the newspaper. William's mother, Diana, famously took that a step further, choosing sensitive issues and putting herself on their frontlines -- for example, by walking through a field of landmines or shaking hands with someone with HIV/AIDS.The duke interacts with the crowd as he visits the UK pavilion at Expo 2020 in Dubai on February 10.William is next-level royalty, taking a solutions-focused approach where he acknowledges the problem but also offers a constructive response. It's hope over fear and evolves what was traditionally a purely ceremonial role.However, he risks backing a solution that turns out to be controversial or politically sensitive. That will be more of an issue once he is the actual monarch but before then, the prince appears willing to stick his neck out to deepen ties with his generation and the next.NEWS OF THE WEEKQueen's health being monitored after Charles tests positive for Covid-19 again. There are fresh concerns for Queen Elizabeth II's health after it was revealed Prince Charles has been reinfected with coronavirus. Clarence House revealed the 73-year-old had pulled out of an appearance in the English city of Winchester on Thursday and was isolating after testing positive for Covid-19 for a second time. A royal source told us that Charles had met with the Queen \"recently\" but did not elaborate on precisely when the meeting occurred. However, the source added that the 95-year-old monarch is not displaying symptoms and the situation will continue to be monitored. The Queen had appeared to be on great form over the weekend, laughing and cracking jokes with guests at a special reception to mark the start of her Platinum Jubilee year. The Queen leaves Sandringham House on February 5, after a reception to celebrate the start of the Platinum Jubilee.Another heartbreaking anniversary for the Queen. It's probably been a week of mixed emotions for the monarch. She headed back to Windsor on Monday after Sunday saw her reach the historic milestone of 70 years on the British throne but also marked seven decades since the death of her father, King George VI. Wednesday also marked 20 years since the death of her sister, Princess Margaret. Despite the painful anniversaries, a royal source told us that upon traveling back to Windsor, the Queen would be resuming her regular duties of audiences, credentials and privy council meetings. Her diary is expected to continue as a mix of both virtual and in-person events. And in yet another signal of the Queen's eagerness to return to normality after her spell of ill health late last year, she is hoping to attend three major engagements next month: a diplomatic reception at Windsor Castle on March 2, the annual Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey on March 14; and a service of thanksgiving for her late husband, Philip, at the same venue on March 29. A portrait of Princess Margaret in a gift shop outside Windsor Castle in 2002THE OTHER TAKEAWAYS FROM THE QUEEN'S PLATINUM JUBILEE MESSAGE A new photograph was released to mark Accession Day and the start of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee year. In the photograph, the monarch smiles broadly in the saloon at Sandringham House. One of her famous red despatch boxes sits on the table nearby.As expected, we didn't see the Queen on Sunday but we did get that extraordinary message in which she expressed her wish for Camilla to take the title of Queen Consort when Charles becomes King. The blessing from the monarch upon her daughter-in-law is being seen as a reward for Camilla's years of public service but also an endorsement of the kind of monarchy that Charles is trying to create. Camilla has been a divisive figure, with some continuing to blame her for the demise of Charles' marriage to the late Princess Diana. Sentiment toward the Duchess of Cornwall has softened since the '90s, and the Queen's moves to future-proof the monarchy suggest the family feel the British public is finally ready to accept her as future Queen. But the Queen's intervention on the subject of Camilla's future title was so unexpected that you may have missed a few other noteworthy moments in her Platinum Jubilee message. One thing the monarch made abundantly clear was that she has no intention of going anywhere soon. As she approaches her 96th year, some have speculated on whether the Queen might step back or even abdicate, but she firmly ruled that out by saying: \"My life will always be devoted to your service.\"The other moment royal-watchers might have missed was the touching acknowledgment of Prince Philip's life in service to her. She described feeling \"blessed\" at having \"a partner willing to carry out the role of consort and unselfishly make the sacrifices that go with it.\" You can read her full message here.FEATURED PHOTOSElizabeth was only 25 years old when she ascended the British throne upon the death of her father.

Prince Andrew to testify under oath next month. The Duke of York has agreed to give a statement under oath in the UK on March 10 as part of the civil sexual abuse case against him, a source close to the duke told CNN on Saturday. David Boies, the lawyer for Andrew's accuser, Virginia Giuffre, said in a statement last month that her legal team was looking \"forward to confronting Prince Andrew with his denials and attempts to blame Ms. Giuffre for her own abuse at his deposition and at trial.\" Boies and another lawyer representing Giuffre, Sigrid McCawley, will conduct the deposition, which is expected to last two days, according to the Daily Telegraph.

The heir to the British throne, who is 73 years old, had to cancel his attendance at an event in the English city of Winchester on Thursday, according to a statement from his official Twitter account. Charles met with the Queen \"recently,\" a royal source told CNN after the news emerged.

Charles first tested positive in late March 2020, as countries around the world were first feeling the effects of the pandemic. Back in 2020 Prince William also tested positive, soon after his father. Charles, who is fully vaccinated, said at the time he was first infected that he had been lucky to only experience mild symptoms, adding he'd \"got away with it quite lightly.\"The Queen marked her platinum jubilee on Sunday by expressing her \"sincere wish\" that her daughter-in-law, the Duchess of Cornwall, should become Queen Consort once Charles is king.Charles' positive test comes just hours after he spent the evening meeting dozens of people at the British Museum celebrating the work of the British Asian Trust, of which he is the founding patron. Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, attended a reception to celebrate the British Asian Trust at The British Museum in London on Wednesday.The trust reported that during his address at the event, the prince -- who was accompanied by his wife, Camilla -- said: \"I cannot quite believe it is almost two years to the day that my wife and myself were able to be with all of you to celebrate the work of the British Asian Trust. Since then, across the globe, there has been terrible loss of life from COVID-19 and we have especially seen the devastating impact throughout South Asia. In these most challenging times, the British Asian Trust has run four significant fundraising appeals which have so far raised almost \u00a320m ($27 million).\"Also in attendance at the event were the UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Home Secretary Priti Patel. Prince Charles' closest aide resigns over cash-for-honorary-titles scandalPA reported that the duchess continued with her engagements Thursday, visiting Paddington Haven, a sexual assault referral center in west London.Back in December Charles and Camilla released a statement commemorating the one-year anniversary of the administration of the world's first Covid-19 vaccine, urging more people to take up the shot.\"It is the most enormous tribute to the remarkable ingenuity and determination of everyone involved that, one year after the first Covid-19 vaccination, more than a hundred million doses have now been delivered,\" the statement said.The world's first Covid-19 vaccine dose was administered to 90-year-old Margaret Keenan in the United Kingdom on December 8, 2020, nine months after the World Health Organization declared the global pandemic.Prince Charles is the third royal this week to test positive for Covid-19. Spain's King Felipe VI tested positive Wednesday morning, after he began to show mild symptoms the previous night, Spain's Royal Household said in a statement.

It was seen as a recognition of the sensitivities around a title that was destined for Charles' first wife, Diana.It's the same reason Camilla doesn't use the title of Princess of Wales.The Queen would be expected to consult her direct heirs Charles and William before making such a significant announcement about titles, which suggests they both agreed and felt the British public is ready to accept Camilla as Queen.The 95-year-old monarch laid out her vision for institution's transition in an extraordinary message released as she reached the 70th anniversary of her accession to the throne.Read More\"I would like to express my thanks to you all for your support.

Elizabeth II is the first British monarch to reach the historic milestone of a Platinum Jubilee and is marking the day privately at her Sandringham estate in eastern England.

Queen hosts Sandringham reception ahead of Platinum JubileeCharles also expressed his gratitude for the Queen's words on Saturday when, as part of a message to mark her landmark milestone, she shared her hope that the heir to the throne's wife, Camilla, would become Queen Consort when he becomes King. \"We are deeply conscious of the honour represented by my mother's wish. As we have sought together to serve and support Her Majesty and the people of our communities, my darling wife has been my own steadfast support throughout,\" the royal added. The extraordinary message was a hugely significant intervention from the monarch, who is the only person who can define royal titles. When Charles married Camilla in 2005, the couple announced she intended to be known as \"Princess Consort\" despite having a right to the title of Queen. It was seen as a recognition of the sensitivities around a title that was destined for Charles' first wife, Diana.It's the same reason Camilla doesn't use the title of Princess of Wales.The Queen would be expected to consult her direct heirs Charles and William before making such a significant announcement about the institution's transition, which suggests they both agreed and felt the British public is ready to accept Camilla as Queen.

        "content": "London (CNN)Britain's Queen Elizabeth II marked the eve of her Platinum Jubilee with a special reception at Sandringham House on Saturday. On Sunday, the 95-year-old will become the first British monarch to celebrate 70 years on the throne. A day before reaching the landmark milestone, the Queen welcomed members of the local community and volunteer groups to her private residence in Norfolk, around 100 miles north of London. The event saw her chat with former cookery student Angela Wood, who helped develop a recipe intrinsically linked to the start of her reign -- Coronation Chicken. The dish of cold chicken in a curry cream sauce with a salad of rice, green peas and mixed herbs was invented to serve to foreign dignitaries at the Coronation banquet. Read MoreOther guests invited to the monarch's home included members of the local Women's Institute, which she has been President of since 2003, as well as Sandringham Estate pensioners and their families, and representatives from local charities, Little Discoverers and West Norfolk Befriending.The Queen spoke with representatives from Little Discoverers, a local group that provides early education for pre-school children with movement difficulties and delayed development.The Queen, wearing an Angela Kelly wedgewood blue crepe with white brocade dress, appeared to be in great spirits during the engagement, according to Britain's PA Media news agency. She held a wooden walking stick and carried her trademark black handbag as she happily made her way round the guests. Analysis: It's been 70 years since the Queen took the throne, but she's not celebrating yetAfter greeting guests, the Queen cut a cake featuring the Platinum Jubilee emblem, which had been prepared specially for the occasion. On her departure, the monarch was given a posy featuring flowers that formed part of her Coronation bouquet back in 1953, such as lily of the valley. It was the largest gathering the sovereign has attended since October when she hosted a reception to mark the Global Investment Summit at Windsor Castle. Guests gathered at the Queen's countryside residence to celebrate her historic milestone with cake. Days later, concerns for her health were raised after she abruptly canceled a trip to Northern Ireland and spent a night in hospital for what a spokesman described at the time as \"preliminary investigations.\" She has since been continuing to follow her doctor's guidance, carrying out light duties remotely by video link and phone and a few small in-person engagements. The Queen traditionally marks Accession Day on February 6 out of the public eye at Sandringham, remembering her father, King George VI, on the anniversary of his death.  She viewed a display of memorabilia from previous jubilees in the Oak Room at Windsor Castle last month. A series of celebrations will take place throughout the year, culminating in a blockbuster four-day public holiday in June when the nation can join in the jubilee-themed festivities.Over the long weekend, beacons will be lit across the United Kingdom, Buckingham Palace will host a music concert, street parties are being encouraged, and a pageant will bring together more than 5,000 personnel, performers, key workers and volunteers from the UK and the Commonwealth.Sign up for CNN's Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on the royal family, what they are up to in public and what's happening behind palace walls.",

It is her Platinum Jubilee -- marking 70 years since the Queen first took the throne in 1952 and making her both the longest-reigning British monarch and the longest-serving female head of state in history.To celebrate the unprecedented anniversary, a number of events will take place throughout the UK over the year -- culminating in a four-day national bank holiday weekend from Thursday June 2 until Sunday June 5, known as the Jubilee Weekend.The holiday itself will include a variety of public events and community activities, as well as \"national moments of reflection\" on the Queen's 70 years of service.The upcoming celebrations will be the Queen's first jubilee without her husband, Prince Philip, who died in 2021.Read MoreThe monarch's private estates -- including Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle -- will also join in with Jubilee themed events.One of the initiatives due to take place as part of the celebrations is known as the \"Platinum Pudding\" celebration -- a nationwide baking competition seeking out a new dessert dedicated to the Queen.

        "content": "A version of this story appeared in the February 4 edition of CNN's Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on Britain's royal family. Sign up here.  (CNN)Queen Elizabeth II is adding yet another achievement to her record-breaking reign, becoming the first British monarch to mark a platinum jubilee on Sunday.But despite an unprecedented seven decades of service, we won't see the usual fanfare just yet.Instead, we know the 95-year-old monarch will be at her home in Sandringham, remembering her father, King George VI, on the anniversary of his death. In keeping with previous years, no public engagements are expected on the day.The most we might anticipate is a new image or message to mark the significance of this particular milestone. Formal military salutes are slated for the following day -- Monday -- as is traditional.This weekend's landmark moment emphasizes a familiar dilemma for the monarchy: commemorating the unwavering commitment of the sovereign but recognizing the personal loss. It's something in which the institution is well practiced, but which remains as sensitive as ever.Read MoreUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson summed it up this week, saying in the House of Commons that \"while it is a moment for national celebration, it will be a day of mixed emotions for Her Majesty,\" before expressing his gratitude for her \"tireless service.\"The last time Elizabeth saw her father was as she and Philip set off for a Commonwealth tour in 1952.King George VI, Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret at London airport to say goodbye to Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh on January 31, 1952. The couple were heading off on a tour of the Commonwealth.Her family had turned up at the airport to see the couple off, with the King cheering her on from the tarmac. Days later, while the pair were in Kenya, she received devastating news -- her father, who was only 56, had died in his sleep from a coronary thrombosis.\"Significantly, we do have to remember that when she came to the throne in 1952, it was really not a very enlightened time in terms of working women,\" said CNN historian and royal expert Kate Williams. \"A lot of people thought that a woman wasn't up to the job despite the fact that Queen Victoria and all the queens before had been great queens on the throne.\"Williams added that she \"really has proved, over and over again, that a woman can do the job of a constitutional monarch, just as well as, if not better than, a man.\"This weekend, the Queen will probably be reflecting on her father's legacy and how his reign helped define her own.Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh pause on the rustic bridge in the grounds of the Royal Lodge, Sagana, their wedding present from the people of Kenya.Like her, Albert Frederick Arthur George -- or Bertie, as he was known to the family -- was not born to be monarch. That was the job of his older brother, who became King Edward VIII when their father died in 1936.But that all changed when Bertie stepped up to take his sibling's place, after Edward abdicated so that he could marry Wallis Simpson. It's a part of royal history we all know well, having been immortalized for the screen in movies like \"The King's Speech\" and shows like \"The Crown.\"Inheriting a monarchy in crisis, Bertie opted for the regal name George VI in a nod to his father and to establish continuity between their reigns. As historian Jane Ridley said in CNN original series \"The Windsors: Inside the Royal Dynasty,\" George's challenge was \"to restore the monarchy to something like the stability that it had before his brother sat on the throne.\"And despite reportedly never wanting the top job, George VI upheld the crown through scandal and war. Upon news of his death, US President Harry Truman said George VI had \"shared to the end of his reign all the hardships and austerities which evil days imposed on the brave British people. In return, he received from the people of the whole Commonwealth a love and devotion which went beyond the usual relationship of a King and his subjects.\"The Queen is known to have been particularly close to her father, and she may have inherited her indefatigable work ethic and practice of putting duty before self from him.During her historic reign, she has appointed 14 Prime Ministers and met with 12 US Presidents. She has been a beacon of continuity through an unprecedented period of change, adapting and modernizing the royal institution with the times. Her greatest achievement is perhaps her ability to remain relevant and popular, despite facing some of the most tumultuous years in modern royal history.With no plans to retire even as she approaches her 96th birthday, a series of celebrations will take place throughout the year, culminating in a blockbuster four-day public holiday in June when the nation can join in the jubilee-themed festivities.The royal family gather around Queen Elizabeth II to watch the fly-past from the balcony of Buckingham Palace following the Trooping the Colour ceremony on June 13, 2015.The unwavering and revered figurehead of the House of Windsor will want to put the family's recent rifts and scandals aside.\"There's going to be some surprises up their sleeve, really the palace are aware just as much as everybody, as this has been a long time coming, no one's really been able to party for quite a long time, so hopefully there's going to be a big party. Covid will be behind us and people can celebrate outdoors and indoors in the way they like,\" Williams said.Prince Charles will probably play a major role during the nationwide festivities, as will Camilla, William and Kate. As the future of the monarchy, they will be front and center alongside the Queen -- a show of renewed strength from the institution.And if all goes well, perhaps we'll soon be looking to her next milestone, when the Queen would surpass France's Louis XIV to become the longest-reigning monarch in world history.

On Wednesday, she became the figurehead for the Rugby Football League and the Rugby Football Union -- patronages bestowed upon her by the Queen. The honorary titles were returned by Harry after he stepped down as a working member of the royal family in early 2020.

It will be installed on Jewry Street, where Licoricia is believed to have lived. The project hopes to educate people about Winchester's royal medieval past and its little-known but important Jewish community, as well as to promote tolerance and diversity, which Licoricia is seen to symbolize.FROM THE ROYAL VAULTThis week we're dipping into the CNN archive to bring you this video segment from CNN's David McKenzie. He spoke to Nahashon Muriithi, a retired porter from Kenya, who recalled his encounter with then-Princess Elizabeth shortly before she found out she would be queen. Have a watch...JUST WATCHEDRemembering Elizabeth becoming a queenReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRemembering Elizabeth becoming a queen 02:45DON'T MISSAs Britain's longest-reigning monarch, the Queen is both a cherished and consistent part of public life -- and her image is synonymous with stability and tradition to the British people. While her love of color and pops of pattern in her outfits is well known, there are much deeper reasons for why she dons such fabulously vibrant hues.Decoding the Queen's colorful styleFor example, did you know that the vivid color blocks for which she is famous are a deliberate choice, to help those of us who line the streets to see her? \"She needs to stand out for people to be able to say 'I saw the Queen,'\" according to the Countess of Wessex in the 2016 documentary \"The Queen at 90.\" But don't just take Sophie's word -- even the Queen once reportedly said: \"I can never wear beige because nobody will know who I am.\" There is an art to dressing one of the most photographed women in history. Over her 70-year reign the Queen has amassed an army of staffers, but few have been trusted with the task of royal dressmaker.Angela Kelly, who has been dressing the Queen since 1994, has helped craft an airtight strategy for ensuring the sovereign looks effortless at every engagement she attends. That approach includes weighted hem-lines and a signature hat, in addition to researching weather forecasts and local customs. Read the story here.POSTCARDS FROM ROYALS AROUND THE GLOBEKing Umberto II of Italy (1904-1983), pictured in around 1940 Italy's former royal family want the crown jewels back.On June 5, 1946, a representative of Italy's royal family deposited the crown jewels in the Bank of Italy. The move came three days after Italians voted in a referendum to abolish the monarchy. And that is where the pieces have remained to this day. Now, the family wants the gems returned. The grandson of former King Umberto II, Emanuele Filiberto of the House of Savoy, represented the family at a mediation session last week, according to the family's lawyer, Sergio Orlandi. But while bank representatives were present, the Prime Minister's office and the Ministry of Economy and Finances were not. In a statement sent to CNN last week, the Prime Minister's press office said the family's request was \"unfounded, given that it concerns assets constituting the 'endowment of the Crown of the Kingdom of Italy' and not personal assets of the House of Savoy.\" Find out more on this story.\n\n\"Throughout the pandemic, the response of the engineering community has been extraordinary.

Matter of fact, all Americans deserve to know the truth behind what the Saudi Arabanian government's role was in 9/11. And there's significant evidence. The FBI has it. The DOJ doesn't deny that it exists,\" Eagleson told CNN's Michael Smerconish on \"Cuomo Prime Time\" Friday. Read More\"We need the President to be our hero. Be our champion, Mr. President. This is a direct appeal to you. Help us in this fight. Stand by our side. Allow us to have the justice and closure that we deserve,\" he said.Signatories of the letter claim that they have been used as a political bargaining chip for two decades. \"We had great hope that President Biden, who campaigned on bringing truth and trust back to the Oval Office, would value the lives and sacrifices of America's citizens over diplomatic relations with a country accused of mass murder,\" the letter reads.Alluding to a Biden campaign promise, the group sent CNN a copy of the letter they received from then-candidate Biden's campaign where he said he would have the Department of Justice work to release 9/11 records. \"I will direct my Attorney General to personally examine the merits of all cases where the invocation of privilege is recommended,\" Biden's letter to the group reads, \"and to err on the side of disclosure in cases where, as here, the events in question occurred two decades or longer ago.\"White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday that the President remains committed to a pledge he made during his presidential campaign to work to release 9/11 records.\"The White House Office of Public Engagement, and the National Security Council staff have had several meetings with groups representing the families of those who perished on 9/11 regarding their document requests and to hear their thoughts on policy priorities that will continue to be a priority,\" Psaki said.The group is also asking the Biden administration to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for its actions. \"Prior administrations have promised 'reviews' only to use them as delay tactics to protect the Saudi government and keep the American people in the dark,\" Eagleson said. \"We hope the Biden administration finally provides the information our families have waited to receive for 20 years, so we can stand together with the President at Ground Zero on 9/11.\"In the letter, the group calls on Biden to implement a policy toward the Kingdom that not only holds them accountable for their role in 9/11, but also the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi and the December 2019 deaths of US service members in Pensacola, Florida. The letter also demands that within that policy, the Biden administration \"immediately cease the Kingdom's support for acts of terrorism.\"CNN's Rachel Janfaza contributed to this report.",

Somewhat like how the Cheesecake Factory menu with its many pages can feel like way too much.Not that I'm complaining. Streaming content is also my peaceful place, and this week my two passions collide in one project.\nThree things to watch'The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey'Read More(From left) Dominique Fishback and Samuel L. Jackson are shown in \"The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey.\"I am a huge fan of the writer Walter Mosley and have read just about all of his novels.Which is why I was super excited to learn that a limited series based on one of my favorites, \"The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,\" was coming to Apple TV+.Samuel L. Jackson plays the title character, a man with dementia who has his memory restored long enough to try and solve the mysterious death of a loved one. Dominique Fishback (who was tremendous in \"Judas and the Black Messiah\") plays his caregiver.It's currently streaming.'The Adam Project' (From left) Ryan Reynolds as Big Adam and Walker Scobell as Young Adam star in \"The Adam Project.\"Ordinarily sci-fi is not my jam, but sign me up for any and everything involving Ryan Reynolds.I am such a huge admirer of his ... acting. In \"The Adam Project,\" Reynolds teams up again with \"Free Guy\" director Shawn Levy for a story about a boy grappling with loss who meets his future self, a time-traveling pilot searching for his wife (played by Zoe Saldana).The movie is now streaming on Netflix.'The Thing About Pam' (From left) Mac Brandt as Detective McCarrick and Glenn Fleshler as Russ Faria star in \"The Thing About Pam.\" Ren\u00e9e Zellweger is getting a lot of attention for donning prosthetics to play Pam Hupp in this limited series, based on a \"Dateline NBC\" story about a woman accused of allegedly killing her best friend, Betsy Faria. But pay attention to the whole cast in this one.For starters, there's Glenn Fleshler as Betsy's husband, Russ Faria, who is, of course, the initial prime suspect and Josh Duhamel as his attorney, Joel Schwartz. And the whole thing feels a bit over the top.The best true crime stories usually are, and this one was not only a \"Dateline\" episode but also a podcast. \"The Thing About Pam\" is airing on NBC.Two things to listen to (From left) Luke Smallbone and Joel Smallbone of For King & Country attend the 52nd GMA Dove Awards at Lipscomb Allen Arena on October 19, 2021, in Nashville, Tennessee. Hey, fans of For King & Country, \"What Are You Waiting For?\"That's the title of the duo's first new album in three years. Grammy-winning brothers Joel and Luke Smallbone fought hard to get here.\"Those first years when we started working together in the late 2000s, those first years we just got turned down,\" Joel Smallborne told American Songwriter. \"By every major label in America.\"They kept the faith (literally, as they credit their success to it) and now the Christian pop artists are enjoying the fruits of their labor.The album dropped Friday. Lil Durk performs at the runway show for PrettyLittleThing x Teyana Taylor at New York Fashion Week on September 9, 2021. Lil Durk's \"7220\" was originally scheduled to drop the same day as Ye's \"Donda 2\" before Lil Durk pushed back the release. To make it even more interesting, the rapper took to his verified Instagram account to dare any other artist to drop their album on the same day.He didn't name anyone in particular, but Lil Durk and NBA YoungBoy have been beefing recently, in case you didn't know.\"7220\" dropped Friday. \nOne thing to talk about(From left) Russell Wilson and Ciara, cofounders of The House of LR&C, celebrate the brand's first retail launch on February 22 in Seattle's University Village. There may have been lots of talk this week about professional quarterback Russell Wilson getting traded, but that's not all that's going on in his world.Wilson and his wife, singer and actor Ciara, also have a new children's book out.The parents of three young children have cowritten a picture book, titled \"Why Not You?\"They recently shared with Jimmy Kimmel on his late night show that Wilson's dad used to often say that phrase and that Ciara's parents also instilled in her that \"no dream is too big.\"\"We share that same passion and connection,\" she told Kimmel.Love that kind of love.Something to sip on A woman passes by Brazilian artist Sipros' mural of the rapper Biggie Smalls, featured on a wall in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, New York, on June 6, 2019.For those of us who remember, it hardly seems possible that it's been 25 years since Biggie Smalls, aka Notorious B.I.G., was gunned down in Los Angeles. The rapper, born Christopher Wallace, was killed when his vehicle came under fire as he and his entourage left an industry party.It feels like only yesterday that I was writing about the 20th anniversary of his death on March 9, 1997.Wallace's murder has never been solved, but his musical influence remains. As is often the case with those who die young, his mythology has grown over the years even as many wonder where both he and his career would be now had he lived.Hip-hop has aged well \u2014 as was displayed at this year's Super Bowl \u2014 but count me as one who wishes that both Wallace and Tupac Shakur, who was gunned down six months before Biggie, had lived to see it. \nWhat did you like about today's newsletter?

        "content": "New York (CNN Business)When Russia moved to \"partially restrict\" Facebook access in the country last week, drawing the social network deeper into an international conflict, it prompted a defiant response from the company's most visible representative on the world stage.Not Mark Zuckerberg, but Nick Clegg.\"Yesterday, Russian authorities ordered us to stop independent fact-checking and labeling of content posted on Facebook by four Russian state-owned media organizations. We refused,\" Clegg, the newly-appointed president of global affairs at Facebook-parent Meta, said in the statement. \"Ordinary Russians are using our apps to express themselves and organize for action. We want them to continue to make their voices heard.\"  In the days following that statement, Clegg has announced new safety features for users in Russia and Ukraine, crackdowns on Russian state-media on its platforms, and other steps Meta is taking to address the conflict, including communicating with foreign governments about the issue. Zuckerberg, meanwhile, has not yet publicly commented on the conflict.  The statements underscore Clegg's ascent to being the policy face of Meta (FB), following his promotion last month. But they also hint at how Zuckerberg may be trying to pull off a disappearing act of sorts. The CEO and founder, according to former insiders and industry watchers, appears to be attempting to reduce his visibility \u2014 and potentially the scrutiny he faces \u2014 on the world stage even as he runs a suite of platforms with a collective user base far larger than any country.Read MoreClegg, the former UK deputy prime minister who has worked as Meta's vice president of global affairs and communications since 2018, was already involved in policy matters and routinely served as an aggressive public voice for the company. But with his promotion last month, Zuckeberg said Clegg will now \"lead and represent us for all of our policy issues globally.\" Zuckerberg also said the change would free up his own time to work on product and technology as the company invests in its vision for a virtual and augmented reality-enabled future, and would let COO Sheryl Sandberg focus more on its business, which currently faces a host of challenges. Big Tech cracks down on Russian state media content amid mounting pressureAs Meta pushes forward with its multibillion-dollar bet to reshape the company, Zuckerberg will get to focus on his vision for building a (currently still conceptual) \"metaverse,\" while Clegg will be tasked with explaining and justifying it and the company's other actions to lawmakers, regulators and the public.  \"When I look at this, the promotion of Nick Clegg in a sense doesn't change anything for his role, but I think the idea is to give him a title so big that Zuckerberg doesn't have to testify [at government hearings] anymore,\" said Roger McNamee, a former Facebook investor and advisor to Zuckerberg who in 2019 published the book \"Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe.\"  But, he added, \"it's very clear to me that Mark's vision is driving the company right now.\" Meta declined to comment on this story.Some Meta followers say the leadership shuffle seems to mirror similar moves made by other tech founders, including Microsoft (MSFT)'s Bill Gates, Amazon (AMZN)'s Jeff Bezos and Larry Page and Sergey Brin of Google (GOOG), all of whom stepped away from public-facing roles as their businesses faced growing scrutiny -\u2014 while retaining immense control and influence over the companies. Like those founders, Zuckerberg remains the largest shareholder with tremendous influence over Meta's business. Unlike those founders, he also remains CEO.But in some ways, it also represents an attempt to return to a time when Facebook was less under fire.A return to simpler times Before 2016, the division of labor among Facebook's top brass looked different: Zuckerberg handled the engineering and product side of the business, and Sandberg handled \"everything else,\" according to Nu Wexler, who worked as a spokesperson for the company from 2017 to 2018.  But that changed, Wexler said, following the US Presidential election in 2016. Facebook started facing more questions about its role in democratic processes and society at large, with Zuckerberg called to testify several times before Congress and the European Parliament in the years that followed.Clegg was hired by the company in 2018 against that backdrop. Although his own political career was somewhat ill-fated, Clegg's political experience and connections were seen as assets to the company, amid growing questions from lawmakers and regulators around the world. Both Zuckerberg and Sandberg were said to have been closely involved in recruiting him to the company. Since then, Facebook-turned-Meta has faced a slew of new PR and policy crises. A short list includes: its 2018 admission that it didn't do enough to prevent its role in a genocide in Myanmar, European regulators passing data privacy regulations; US antitrust regulators seeking to break up the company; the January 6 Capitol riot that was organized in part on Facebook; and, most recently, the release of the Facebook Papers, which Clegg was involved in addressing last year.  With his promotion, Meta President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg has effectively become the company's most public face on policy issues.Clegg's elevated profile, Wexler said, shows how the challenges Meta faces on public policy have grown too large to be housed solely within Sandberg's department. It also underscores how Sandberg's own responsibilities \u2014 particularly wrestling with the future of Meta's ad business, which is now under threat due to Apple's ad tracking changes and competition from rivals like TikTok \u2014 have given her less time to devote to policy matters. Clegg's new role means that in addition to handling Meta's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, he'll also likely take a leading role in some of the company's most pressing upcoming decisions. Those include how to ensure the platform isn't compromised by misinformation or foreign actors during the upcoming US midterm elections later this year and how to respond to calls to protect children on its platforms.  An especially important test will come when Meta must decide in January 2023 whether to permit former President Donald Trump back on its platforms ahead of the next presidential election, said Katie Harbarth, a Facebook alum who helped lead the company's global election efforts until her departure last year. Whether Zuckerberg plays a role in that decision will send an important signal about who is truly in charge, she said. 'Mark can run, but he can't hide'Clegg's promotion undeniably makes him more visible, particularly in international business forums like Davos where being an official member of the C-suite opens many doors, said Harbath. The change may also mean that Clegg will be the executive Meta tries to put forward for future hearings on Capitol Hill and with other government leaders abroad.  Facebook is rebranding everything but faces the same old problems\"I think that the company got to the realization that Mr. Zuckerberg does not represent the company well externally, especially not in the political context,\" Luria said. \"That his appearances before Congress probably did the company more damage than they did good and putting somebody like Mr. Clegg in that position seems like a far better choice whenever they can.\" The question is whether hostile governments around the world will accept Clegg as a spokesman of authority or whether policymakers will continue to demand Zuckerberg. Watch any high-profile Big Tech hearing where a company is represented by anyone other than the CEO and the annoyance among government representatives is palpable.\"At the end of the day, Mark can run, but he can't hide from the regulatory pressure,\" Harbath said. \"I really like Nick. I think he is going to be a really great person to talk to policymakers and relate to them. But I don't think it's going to stop people from wanting to talk to Mark.\"",

        "content": "(CNN Business)The Federal Communications Commission is on the hunt for companies it oversees that may have ownership ties to Russia, in a prelude to possible clampdowns following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.The internal assessment, which has not been previously reported or publicly announced, was launched this week by FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, according to a person familiar with the matter. It follows mounting scrutiny of Russian-backed programming on US airwaves, social media and other channels as the war in Ukraine unfolds. It also comes as President Joe Biden on Thursday announced a range of new sanctions against Russia. Jessica Rosenworcel, now chairwoman of the Federal Communications Commission, speaks at a Senate hearing in November 2021.Conducted jointly with the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security, the FCC review covers more than just media entities regulated by the FCC's broadcast licensing program, the person said. It also covers a vast array of telecommunications and infrastructure companies, including wireless providers, submarine cable operators and foreign telecom services that connect US-international phone calls, the person said. DHS declined to comment. DOJ didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Read MoreIt is not yet clear how many companies with ties to Russia the review may uncover, the person said, describing the initiative as a \"top-to-bottom\" effort to \"identify the universe of licensees that have Russian ownership that should be on our radar.\"Any Russian-owned companies the FCC identifies as potential security risks to the United States could face tougher scrutiny from regulators, including the potential risk of being ejected from the US market. Russia moves to 'partially restrict' Facebook access over censorship allegationsThe FCC has previously made similar moves with a series of Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE, whose networking equipment US national security officials have said could permit Chinese surveillance of sensitive US communications. The companies have repeatedly denied that they facilitate Chinese spying, and attempted to persuade the FCC to reverse its decisions, albeit unsuccessfully. Amid those same concerns, the FCC has also implemented a program to \"rip and replace\" equipment from US telecommunications networks that it has deemed a potential security risk.Last year, the FCC adopted rules requiring state-funded media to disclose their foreign ties when broadcasting on US airwaves, a transparency measure implemented after US lawmakers raised concerns about a Washington, D.C.-area radio station airing \"Russian propaganda in our nation's Capital ... without informing its listeners that that the broadcast is truly sponsored by the Russian government.\" However, the rules are in legal limbo amid a court challenge by US broadcaster groups.The FCC is also expected to announce, as early as Friday, a new inquiry into internet security that is motivated in part by past incidents with suspicious links to Russia-based actors, the person added. The probe is expected to gather information from internet service providers and other industry players about the current security of internet traffic routing, with a possible eye toward future federal regulations.Under normal circumstances, when an internet user seeks to access a website, the requested content gets split up and routed through multiple efficient paths before reaching the recipient. But in recent years, security experts have increasingly warned of attacks that \"hijack\" one or more of those routes for hackers' own purposes, enabling them to route internet users to malicious, fraudulent sites instead of their intended destination.The expected FCC inquiry follows a flurry of recent actions to increase the agency's profile on cybersecurity issues. Those efforts include partnering with DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on a campaign known as Shields Up, which specifically advises the private sector on how to deal with hacking threats originating from Russia and other adversaries.",

Hours later, a second rally planned in nearby Murfreesboro was canceled.The demonstrations, which organizers called the \"White Lives Matter\" rally, were planned by The League of the South, a Southern nationalist group, according to Brad Griffin, the organization's public relations chief. Other extreme-right and neo-Nazi groups joined them in the protests wearing black and bearing helmets and shields.The groups had planned to start at Shelbyville and then head to Murfreesboro about 20 miles to the north, but the Murfreesboro rally was canceled, Griffin said. About 800 to 1,000 counterprotesters had gathered in Murfreesboro to oppose the demonstrations, Rutherford County Sheriff Mike Fitzhugh and Murfreesboro Interim Police Chief Michael Bowen said in a joint statement.Griffin announced the rally was canceled on Twitter saying that Murfreesboro was a \"lawsuit trap\" and that holding an event there was not worth the risk. White nationalist groups (bottom) and counter-protesters (top) gather in Shelbyville, Tennessee, on Saturday.Read MoreIn both cities, police set up barricades to separate the two factions on opposite sides of the road. City leaders in Shelbyville and Murfreesboro had advised people to avoid the rally areas, and the area surrounding the Shelbyville event was nearly deserted.The rallies were expected to be the largest of their kind since the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August, Griffin said. That demonstration became a scene of chaos and violence as the white nationalist groups fought with counterprotesters.One woman was killed when a Nazi sympathizer drove into a crowd of counterprotesters.Why these cities?The decision to hold the rallies in Shelbyville and Murfreesboro, two mid-sized cities in central Tennessee, came down to familiarity, city demographics and several prominent local news stories, Griffin said.The League of the South held a rally in Shelbyville in 2013 in an attempt to bring attention to refugee resettlement in that area. The event went fairly smoothly, Griffin said, so the organization trusted local law enforcement to protect them.\"We decided after that we didn't want to do anything like (Charlottesville) again. We wanted to go to a place where we can expect the police to uphold the law,\" he said. \"Every event we've ever had in Tennessee has been peaceful. We have greater confidence in local law enforcement.\"Vandals strike Tennessee mosqueThe demographics of the cities also played a role in the decision. Both Shelbyville, with about 20,000 people, and Murfreesboro, with about 130,000 people, are in more rural counties that heavily favored President Donald Trump in the 2016 election.Charlottesville, which is home to the University of Virginia, has become a hotbed of white nationalist activists partly because of the city's decision to remove several Confederate monuments. Still, the city is a liberal stronghold.Griffin said the rural Tennessee cities were the \"exact opposite\" of Charlottesville in terms of demographics.\"We do not think Shelbyville, Tennessee, will be anything Charlottesville, Virginia, just because it is a very different city,\" Griffin said.Murfreesboro has a recent history of racial controversy. In 2010, local Muslims proposed to build a new mosque in the city, and it led to harsh anti-Muslim sentiment and several years of legal wrangling.The Islamic Center of Murfreesboro opened in 2012 after facing significant local opposition.A sign announcing the mosque was vandalized with the words, \"not welcome,\" and the building was targeted by bomb threats and arson. Still, the Islamic Center in Murfreesboro officially opened in 2012.In addition, the far-right groups wanted to bring more attention to the shooting at Burnette Chapel Church of Christ in nearby Antioch that left one dead and seven others wounded last month. The suspect in the shooting, Emanuel Kidega Samson, was from Sudan and had legal US residency, police said.#MurfreesboroLovesShelbyville residents asked passersby to say \"Boo to Hate\" on October 27.League of the South reached out to Shelbyville about three weeks ago to set up the protest, according to Shanna Boyette, the city manager. The city does not require permits to protest on public ground.Murfreesboro does require approval to hold a protest, and the League of the South filed an application, according to city spokesman Mike Browning. The office of Mayor Shane McFarland issued the permit Wednesday, saying the city has limited legal authority to deny permission for the event, \"regardless of how reprehensible the intended speech is.\"Jessica Ortega, 28, said she drove from Clarksville, Tennessee, to protest the white nationalist rally.\"I had to drive down. You can't live a couple hours away from something like this and not get up off your a to protest,\" she said.\"What will I tell my daughters? 'Mommy was too busy watching football to protest a Nazi takeover?' Not me. Not in my state,\" Ortega said.Mayor McFarland posted a video on Facebook with several religious and community leaders supporting diversity and denouncing prejudice and injustice. \"We are Murfreesboro and we stand together,\" McFarland said.In Murfreesboro, some businesses and restaurants boarded up their windows near the rally sites and posted signs saying \"Murfreesboro Loves.\" That phrase, one of the main hashtags for those opposed to the rally's message, was also written into the fence outside the Murfreesboro Boys and Girls Club.    There is a lot of hate pouring into our town, all of which is unwelcome, and some of which will come to a climax on Saturday. I can not stress the importance of making sure you all stay safe this weekend. These unfortunate guests are not worth you not being able to fight another day. #MurfreesboroLoves A post shared by Sage Alexandra Kafsky (@sagertooth.tiger) on Oct 26, 2017 at 2:14pm PDT\nBecause of the rally, Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro canceled plans for a band competition and postponed a science event scheduled for this weekend, according to the university's president, Sidney McPhee.By the numbers: 7 charts that explain hate groups in the United States\"The groups initiating Saturday's rally do not reflect the values of our university and we are heartsick that so many of our plans and activities set on campus have been disrupted out of an abundance of caution,\" McPhee wrote in a letter to the community.Some residents planned to stand up to the rally with competing protests and community action. Keith Caldwell, a pastor at a Murfreesboro church, told CNN affiliate WSMV he was planning to gather to counteract their message.\"We are effectively praying with our legs in order to show up and look evil in the face and to say, 'We withdraw consent from your power,'\" Caldwell said.A Facebook group called Murfreesboro Loves held marches, prayers and rallies in different areas of the city Saturday, followed by an event with live music and pizza.\"We will drive home the message that white supremacy is not welcome in Murfreesboro,\" the group posted on Facebook Saturday night.CNN's Nicole Chavez, Sara Ganim, Ella Wilkie, Dianne Gallagher, Jaide Timm-Garcia and Intisar Seraaj contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Alex Murdaugh, the suspended South Carolina attorney accused of financial wrongdoing and setting up a suicidal insurance fraud scheme, was charged with 23 more crimes in four new indictments returned by a grand jury, the state attorney general said Friday.The fresh indictments allege Murdaugh stole more than $2.2 million meant for four clients: Natarsha Thomas, Hakeem Pinckney, Arthur Badger and Deon Martin. The new charges include 19 counts of breach of trust with fraudulent intent and four counts of computer crimes.Alex Murdaugh agrees to a $4.3 million settlement in housekeeper caseThe new indictments bring to 71 the number of charges Murdaugh faces stemming from accusations he defrauded victims of nearly $8.5 million in various schemes.CNN has reached out to Murdaugh's attorney for comment. Murdaugh has been facing other charges, including those stemming from being shot in the head on a roadway in September and surviving. Authorities said he admitted the shooting was a conspiracy with a former client to kill him as part of a fraud scheme so his only surviving son could collect an insurance payout.Read MoreIn that case, Murdaugh was charged with insurance fraud, conspiracy to commit insurance fraud and with filing a false police report. The September 4 shooting happened a day after he resigned from his law firm amid allegations he had misappropriated funds. The law firm filed a lawsuit against him in October alleging he converted firm and client money to his own personal use.Authorities have said other investigations related to the Murdaugh family are underway, including into the June deaths of Murdaugh's wife and other son, who were gunned down at their family estate in Islandton. That case is unsolved. Murdaugh has denied responsibility in those deaths.The investigations have gripped South Carolina's Lowcountry, where the Murdaughs have been a prominent family for decades. Three members held the office of 14th Circuit solicitor for 87 years, ending with Murdaugh's father, who left office in 2005.The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, the office of South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson, the FBI, and a US attorney's office conducted the latest state grand jury investigation that led to Fridays charges, a news release from Wilson's office said. Wilson's office will prosecute the case, according to the news release.  Murdaugh remains jailed in Columbia, South Carolina, with bond set at $7 million. A judge earlier this week denied Murdaugh's motion to reconsider his bond.Accused of stealing settlement money from disabled manMurdaugh is accused of allegedly stealing a settlement totaling at least $1 million from Pinckney's family. Pinckney family attorney and state representative Justin Bamberg called Murdaugh a \"predator,\" telling CNN he believes \"$1 million is gone, and nobody knows where it's at.\"  Back in 2009, Pinckney -- deaf since he was a young child -- was severely injured when a tire tread on the car he was riding in came off, causing the car to overturn as it was going northbound on I-95 in Hampton County, South Carolina, according to the complaint filed against the manufacturer. The accident rendered Pinckney, who was 19 at the time, a quadriplegic. Pinckney's family hired Murdaugh, who sued the tire company on his behalf. According to Bamberg, Murdaugh arranged for Russell Laffitte, then-president of Palmetto State Bank, to serve as Pinckney's conservator since he could not represent himself.After Murdaugh settled with the tire company, checks were written from Murdaugh's law firm to be made payable to Palmetto State Bank where Laffitte worked, according to an indictment.Instead of the money going to the family, Bamberg said Murdaugh withdrew the money -- in some cases, in the form of money orders -- and claimed it as his own. According to the indictment, Murdaugh is accused of using a $309,581 check, which was supposed to be part of Pinckney's settlement funds. He allegedly purchased a money order payable to a family member, the indictment said. That family member was not specified in the indictment.  The money in the Pinckney case was never seen again, leaving Murdaugh and Laffitte responsible for the whereabouts of the funds, according to Bamberg. \"Palmetto State Bank is deeply concerned about the troubling allegations that have been made about Mr. Pinckney's settlement funds,\" the bank's counsel said in a statement to CNN. \"The bank has taken immediate action under the leadership of its Board of Directors to obtain all of the pertinent facts and information. Palmetto State Bank intends to do what it can to right any wrongs that may have been committed.\"CNN has reached out to both Murdaugh's lawyers and to Russell Laffitte but has not received a response from either. Laffitte was terminated from Palmetto State Bank earlier this month.  Pinckney died in a nursing home, two years after the accident. His mother, sister and niece survived the crash but were all severely injured and in need of the settlement money, according to the family's attorney.\"Every penny of this money was intended for these people to be able to take care of themselves and to live as comfortably as they can, even though their life physically changed forever and that is what he took from them,\" said Bamberg. \"He didn't care that your son died. He wanted to win a lot of money and then take a lot of money at the same time.\"CNN's Maria Cartaya, Alta Spells, Jason Hanna and Alaa Elassar contributed to this report.",

According to the State Board of Elections, more than 1,400 candidates had already filed for various offices.The court order will move all of the state's primary elections, not just the ones affected by the maps at the center of the lawsuit, from March 8 to May 17. North Carolina's primaries had been among the earliest, but as legal challenges continue against maps around the country, it's possible North Carolina's won't be the only ones delayed. 'No one with power is listening:' Activists warn redistricting moves in the South threaten Black political powerThe court ordered the trial court to rule on the case by January 11, after which there'd be an expedited appeals process. Opponents of the maps claim they're gerrymanders that violate the state constitution.Read MoreNorth Carolina's Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who didn't play a role in the redistricting process, celebrated the ruling.\"Today's order by the state Supreme Court restores faith in the rule of law and it is necessary for the Court to rule on the constitutionality of these unfair districts before the next election,\" Cooper said in a statement. The state Republican Party defended the GOP-passed maps and attacked the court. \"The Democrat majority on the N.C. Supreme Court, cloaked in secrecy, just blocked primary elections for hundreds of candidates who already filed to run for office,\" the party said in a statement. \"This just injected more chaos and confusion into elections at the direct expense of the people of North Carolina.\" Gerrymandering: How it's being exposed and how it affects your stateWednesday's ruling is just the latest act in the Tar Heel State's fraught recent redistricting history. Courts ordered new maps in both 2016 and 2019. In 2016, the proceedings resulted in the some primaries being delayed from March to June. Other early primary states are facing litigation over their maps. Earlier this week, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit alleging that Texas' new congressional map illegally discriminates against Latinos and Blacks. Texas' March 1 primary is the only one scheduled to take pace earlier than North Carolina's had been. The primary process could also be delayed in some states with divided government, like Pennsylvania, where it's expected that legislatures and governors will be unable to agree on maps and courts will need to take over.",

        "content": "(CNN)Suspended South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh has been indicted on more than two dozen new financial crimes by a state grand jury, which alleged schemes to \"defraud victims of and thereafter launder\" nearly $5 million in five different counties.South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson's office announced Friday a state grand jury issued five indictments with a total of 27 charges against Murdaugh.The indictments include four counts of Breach of Trust with Fraudulent Intent; seven counts of Obtaining Signature or Property by False Pretenses; seven counts of Money Laundering; eight counts of Computer Crimes; and one count of Forgery.The majority of the indictments center on cases and victims not previously known to the public, like a highway patrolman injured in the line of duty, from whom prosecutors allege Murdaugh stole settlement money for \"his own personal use, for expenses including but not limited to overdraft fees, cash, and checks written to associates.\"\"Altogether, Murdaugh is charged with respect to alleged schemes to defraud victims and thereafter launder $4,853,488.09,\" said the Attorney General's office in a release Friday.Read MoreAccording to the indictments, state attorneys alleged Murdaugh defrauded and laundered $792,000 in Bamberg County, $125,000 in Orangeburg County, $70,000 in Colleton County, $383,056.14 in Allendale County and $3,483,431.95 in Beaufort County. The multi-million-dollar sum in Beaufort County is related to the previously reported wrongful death settlement with the family of the Murdaugh family's housekeeper, Gloria Satterfield. Murdaugh is currently being held without bond in a Columbia, S.C. jail on two earlier charges of obtaining property by false pretenses related to the Satterfield family wrongful death settlement. In a statement sent to CNN, the attorneys for the Satterfield family addressed the new indictments, saying, in part, \"The Satterfield family is grateful to law enforcement for their continued efforts in the investigation of the facts and circumstances surrounding the death of Gloria Satterfield and the egregious breaches of trust and theft committed upon her sons. The additional indictments brought today in connection with the crimes committed against Gloria and her sons as well as apparently others are welcome, long overdue and were appropriately brought.\"Attorneys Eric Bland and Ronnie Ritcher continued in the statement, \"Of course, Mr. Murdaugh is entitled to his presumption of innocence and to his rights under the criminal process.  For now, however, it seems the statewide grand jury was as unimpressed with his opioid defense and other explanations given as we have been.  As always, we are steadfastly in the Satterfield corner and committed to seeing these matters to the end.  Ultimately, we will entrust a judge or jury to let us know when the Satterfields have received their full cup of justice -- not Alex Murdaugh or his attorneys.\"CNN has reached out to Murdaugh's attorneys, Dick Harpootlian and Jim Griffin, for comment but has not received a response.He is also facing several lawsuits in civil court, including one from his former firm.Murdaugh, a once prominent South Carolina attorney, was shot in the head on a roadway September 4, but survived. He later admitted to authorities he conspired with former client Curtis Smith to kill him as part of a fraud scheme so his only surviving son could collect a $10 million life insurance payout.Murdaugh has since been charged with insurance fraud, conspiracy to commit insurance fraud, and filing a false police report.The shooting followed the June deaths of Murdaugh's wife, Margaret, and son, Paul, who were fatally shot outside their home in Islandton, South Carolina. The case remains unsolved. Murdaugh has denied responsibility in the killings.",

        "content": "(CNN)John Scott, the newly appointed top election official in Texas, briefly represented President Donald Trump in his legal challenge of the 2020 election results in Pennsylvania.  Gov. Greg Abbott announced Thursday his appointment of Scott, a Fort Worth attorney, to be the next Texas secretary of state. The position has been vacant since Ruth Hughes resigned from the office in May.\"John Scott is a proven leader with a passion for public service, and his decades of experience in election law and litigation make him the ideal choice for the Texas Secretary of State,\" Abbott said in a statement. \"John understands the importance of protecting the integrity of our elections and building the Texas brand on an international stage. I am confident that John's experience and expertise will enhance his oversight and leadership over the biggest and most thorough election audit in the country.\"Scott will serve as the interim secretary of state until he is confirmed by the legislature, which is not scheduled to meet again until 2023. The announcement did not mention Scott's previous work representing the former President. Read MoreCNN has reached out to Scott for comment. On November 13, 2020, Scott was announced as an attorney to represent Trump in his attempt to stop the Pennsylvania election certification. Three days later, on November 16, he filed a motion to withdraw as counsel. Bryan Hughes, a Texas state senator who wrote the restrictive election overhaul bill signed into law this summer, was also an attorney on that case. He works for Scott's law firm and also withdrew from representing Trump. State Democrats have already criticized the appointment.\"The governor's choice for Secretary of State is unfortunately consistent with his anti-democracy agenda. Abbott is appointing one of the architects of Republicans' big lie that Donald Trump actually won the 2020 election to oversee all electoral activity in our state,\" Texas House Democratic Caucus Chair Chris Turner said in a statement. \"The governor had every opportunity to appoint a new Secretary of State during one of his many special sessions to allow the Texas Senate to hold a confirmation hearing. Instead, he waited until the Legislature adjourned, denying Texans the fair and transparent process they deserve.Scott previously served as a deputy attorney general when Abbott was the Texas attorney general. In 2014, he defended the state's voter ID law against lawsuits from civil and voting rights organizations. He also worked as the Texas Health and Human Services Commission's chief operating officer. According to Abbott's announcement, Scott also serves as senior adviser and liaison to the governor for Texas border and Mexican Aafairs and serves as chief international protocol officer for Texas.",

        "content": "(CNN)When activist Tammye Pettyjohn Jones knocks on voters' doors in her rural corner of Georgia this month, she'll have a new tool in hand: a portable printer.A sweeping voting law Georgia enacted this year now requires voters who do not have a driver's license or state ID to provide a copy of another form of identification with their absentee ballot application.So Pettyjohn Jones and other volunteers with Sisters in Service of Southwest Georgia plan to take photos of that identification and print them out on the spot for voters to submit along with their absentee ballot applications. \"You don't have time to hem and haw about how hard it is\" to vote, said PettyJohn Jones, who is working to turn out voters ahead of November's municipal elections in places like Americus, Georgia. \"You've got to go into a problem-solving mode.\"In states from Georgia to Montana, activists are scrambling to help voters navigate the new restrictions passed largely in Republican-controlled states after record turnout in 2020 helped elect President Joe Biden and flipped control of the US Senate to Democrats. In Florida, for example, some organizations have taken iPads into the field so voters could use the devices to register to vote on their own, said Brad Ashwell of All Voting is Local Florida. Read MoreThat helps the organizations bypass a little-noticed provision of Florida's new law -- one that requires third-party groups registering voters to deliver a mandatory disclaimer that they \"might not\" deliver registration materials to election offices in time. Activists say that's a misleading statement aimed at curbing voter registration drives.In neighboring Georgia, meanwhile, the New Georgia Project plans to train a cadre of criminal and civil rights lawyers on the nuances of the state's 98-page voting law so they can assist voters who encounter problems on Election Day.  The lawyers will be deployed to help next month in Atlanta, during the city's high-profile mayoral election, and their work will serve as a pilot project for the 2022 midterms, said Aklima Khondoker, the group's chief legal officer.Georgia is one of 19 states that have passed 33 new laws this year to restrict voting, according to an updated tally by the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's law school. But some of the most extensive changes are clustered in just a handful. Four states -- Iowa, Georgia, Florida and Texas -- enacted sweeping revisions of their existing laws, bundled together in single omnibus bills.In addition, Texas and three others -- Montana, Arizona and Arkansas -- have passed multiple laws with new restrictions, according to the Brennan Center.Efforts to pass federal legislation to overcome the raft of new state voting restrictions remain at a standstill in Congress, despite intense lobbying by voting rights groups. So, organizations say they are plunging ahead with voter-education efforts and using next month's off-year contests to test tactics for future elections. Next year, the governor's mansion and a key US Senate seat are in the ballot in this key swing state. \"We cannot wait for Washington,\" Khondoker told CNN. \"Nobody is here to save us. We have to save ourselves and democracy here in Georgia.\"'Voices are being silenced'In Montana, new laws outlaw paying anyone to collect ballots and bar the use of some tribal IDs in voter registration.\"We are seeing Native voters question whether or not voting is really worth it,\" said Keaton Sunchild, political director of the nonprofit Western Native Voice, based in Billings, Montana.His group collected ballots on behalf of 555 Montanans from seven reservations in last year's general election, he said.\"The excitement we saw in 2020 to vote is simply not there anymore because, despite a record number of Native voters, their voices still weren't heard,\" he said. \"With these new laws, their voices are being silenced before the election even takes place.\"Activists also worry about overloading voters with too much information about the new requirements.In Texas, the state's new voting law doesn't take effect until early December.Sarah Labowitz of the ACLU of Texas said her group is working behind the scenes on its voter-education materials but wants to avoid sowing confusion because Texans won't confront real change until the March 2022 primaries.\"We're not doing a ton now of 'Watch out! Things are coming in March!' she said, \"You want to be careful with voter education because people can get confused really easily and discouraged.\"And Texas still could make further changes to its election statutes. Lawmakers, meeting in a special session this month, are weighing reinstituting stiffer penalties for illegal voting.Leaning inBack in Georgia, officials with the voting rights group, Black Voters Matter, are urging voters to cast their ballots early in municipal elections to avoid confusion on Election Day.  The group and its partners, such as Sisters in Service, played a key role in driving Black turnout during last year's general election and in runoffs this year that saw two Democrats elected to the US Senate.The new Georgia law changes an array of practices. Among other provisions: It bars election officials from sending out absentee voting applications to all voters, and it requires voters to submit identification to request an absentee ballot. Previously, Georgia law only required voters to sign the application.\"It's definitely frustrating,\" Fenika Miller, the senior state coordinator in Georgia for Black Voters Matter, said of the new rules. \"But we're encouraging our partners to lean into their power,\" she said. \"We can look at what we delivered in the last Senate race and the runoff and know that we can transform the landscape of our country and our communities.\"",

        "content": "Washington, DC (CNN)A North Carolina state court panel on Friday blocked a voter identification law, citing discrimination against Black voters.The law, known as SB 824, was passed in 2018 after Republicans lost their supermajority in the legislature but before the new legislature took over. It was already on hold under a preliminary injunction, after North Carolina's Court of Appeals said voter ID provisions could negatively impact Black voters. But now the state court has permanently blocked the law, which required photo identification to vote. The majority of the three-judge panel said Friday that the law \"was motivated at least in part by an unconstitutional intent to target African American voters.\"\"Other, less restrictive voter ID laws would have sufficed to achieve the legitimate nonracial purposes of implementing the constitutional amendment requiring voter ID, deterring fraud, or enhancing voter confidence,\" Superior Court Judges Michael O'Foghludha and Vince Rozier wrote in their ruling Friday.The ruling, which comes as voting rights are under attack across the country, could still be appealed.Read MoreIn a statement, Southern Coalition for Social Justice co-executive director and chief counsel for voting rights Allison Riggs and pro bono counsel Andrew Ehrlich -- attorneys who served on behalf of a group of North Carolina voters -- said they \"hope\" the ruling sent \"a strong message that racial discrimination will not be tolerated.\"The statement continued: \"Today's ruling striking down North Carolina's latest unconstitutional photo voter ID law is a testament to the overwhelming evidence, including compelling stories of disenfranchisement from voters themselves, which highlighted how the state's Republican-controlled legislature undeniably implemented this legislation to maintain its power by targeting voters of color.\"\"However, GOP leaders in North Carolina on Friday called the ruling \"partisan,\" doubling down on the claim that voter IDs promote election security.\"For all their talk about a secure democracy, the left, with an able assist from the judiciary, is doing their best to undermine it. Today, a partisan court blocked the will of a majority of North Carolinians who amended their Constitution to require photo voter ID,\" North Carolina state Sen. Paul Newton, a Republican, said in a statement.\"The Republican-led legislature has made incredible strides to increase confidence in elections, and Democrats continue to use the judicial branch to thwart the will of the majority of North Carolinians. We will appeal this case,\" he said.After the ruling, Sam Hayes, general counsel for North Carolina House Speaker Tim Moore, also a Republican, said, \"This fight is far from over.\"\"Once again, liberal judges have defied the will of North Carolinians on election integrity. Voters of this state have repeatedly supported a voter ID requirement -- going so far as to enshrine it in our state constitution. Senate Bill 824 is one of the most generous in the country, and it was modeled on those of other states. At trial, Plaintiffs could not produce a single witness who would be unable to vote because of the law,\" Hayes said in a statement.\"We look forward to appealing this partisan ruling on behalf of the people of North Carolina,\" he added.In a statement, the plaintiffs' attorneys brushed off any potential appeal.\"Should legislative defendants appeal today's ruling, we'll be prepared to remind them of what this court and the state's constitution mandate: every vote matters,\" they said.",

        "content": "San Antonio, Texas (CNN)Some clinics and groups helping fund abortion care in Texas are seeing an uptick in calls from people trying to \"catch\" them running afoul of the state's restrictive new ban.\"We have those people calling saying things like, 'oh but can't you slip me in' because they're wanting to find the provider who actually isn't following the law,\" said Jeffrey Hons, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood South Texas in San Antonio, Texas.The new abortion law in Texas bans the procedure as early as six weeks into pregnancy and creates criminal penalties for anyone who assists people in obtaining one. In the week since the ban went into effect, clinics and abortion funds have been fighting back in court while fielding an increased number of calls. They said some callers are people scared and confused about their options and others are from people looking for grounds for civil litigation.Texans fear the dire consequences of new laws targeting people of color\"I've had people come to me and ask me if they can still get abortions or they're going to go to jail,\" said Makayla Montoya, an abortion rights activist and founder of the Buckle Bunnies Fund. \"That's a horrible thing for somebody to think in a time of crisis.\" For the past week, Montoya has been dropping off packages with pregnancy tests and emergency contraceptive pills at homes around San Antonio and helping connect people with abortion funds in other states. Read MoreShe says she's heard desperation and confusion in people's voices, especially from those who can't afford the 10-hour drive to New Mexico or another state to get an abortion. \"It's desperation because they're pregnant, they can't access abortion... because now they're financially screwed and they don't know what their next step is,\" Montoya says. Supporters of abortion rights are pushing back against the ban on multiple fronts, including the courts and asking the Biden administration to use the muscle of the federal government.The Supreme Court refused to block the legislation last week. But the Justice Department sued the state of Texas on Thursday, saying the ban is unconstitutional because it conflicts with \"the statutory and constitutional responsibilities of the federal government.\"The Justice Department's uphill battle against Texas' abortion ban The lawsuit, filed in a federal court in Austin, alleges that the abortion law violates the Constitution's supremacy clause, which establishes that the US Constitution and federal law generally take precedence over state laws.Renae Eze, press secretary for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, said the state passed a law \"that ensures that the life of every child with a heartbeat will be spared from the ravages of abortion,\" and the governor's office is confident the courts will uphold it. \"Unfortunately, President Biden and his Administration are more interested in changing the national narrative from their disastrous Afghanistan evacuation and reckless open border policies instead of protecting the innocent unborn,\" Eze said in a statement.Attorney General Merrick Garland told reporters on Thursday that he would sue any other state that enacts similar laws. Earlier this week, Garland had pledged to protect abortion clinics in the state by enforcing a federal law that prohibits making threats against patients seeking reproductive health services and obstructing clinic entrances.Abortion rights advocates marched outside the Texas State Capitol last week after a new strict abortion ban went into effect.They are answering 'vigilante justice' callsPlanned Parenthood South Texas, which operates three out of the four facilities providing abortion care in San Antonio, has stopped offering the procedure due to the ban. Hons, the clinics' president and CEO, said the decision was not easy and it was painful because most of the people who sought an abortion last year at those facilities were over six weeks pregnant. Keeping abortion care going for a very small number of people who would still be eligible under the ban, he says, would put them at a high risk of lawsuits that could draw them out of business. The Texas ban deputizes any private citizen in the country with the power to bring civil litigation, in Texas state courts, against abortion providers accused of violating the ban. It opens up clinics -- and anyone else accused of \"aiding and abetting\" -- to the threat of unending litigation.Montoya says the Buckle Bunnies Fund has been receiving more fake calls and request in the past week from people \"trying to catch us\" breaking the law. While they have taken safety measures, Montoya thinks those calls won't be stopping anytime soon.\"I think we're going to be seeing a lot more of that because they're empowered now by the state to kind of like enact vigilante justice,\" Montoya said.  Makayla Montoya, an abortion rights activist and founder of the Buckle Bunnies Fund in San Antonio, Texas.The ban has taken an emotional toll for the clinics' call takers, Hons said. They had to be \"bearers of bad news,\" and act as if they were \"under microscopic evaluation\" when answering calls from people pretending to be patients and \"trying to trick us up in a lie.\"\"Our contact center staff have to be so careful to find out who we're talking to, what they're asking about and provide only the information that is allowed (under the law),\" Hons said. At least two abortion funds in the state, Frontera Fund and West Fund, have temporarily stopped taking calls and text through their hotlines to restructure their operations and for the safety of callers and volunteers, they said. Several companies have pushed back against the ban in the past week. Ridehail companies Lyft and Uber said they would cover legal fees for their drivers who are sued as a result of the new legislation. Meanwhile, GoDaddy took down a website that allowed people to post tips about possible Texas abortions.For now, Hons said he's trying to stay positive because he hopes the ban will be overthrown in court.\"We're not about to fold our tent now so right now we stay strong. We've provided the care that we have for 83 years here, and we will keep fighting this legal fight,\" he said.",

        "content": "(CNN)Texas lawmakers gave final approval Tuesday to a bill that would impose new restrictions on voting, sending it to the desk of Republican Gov. Greg Abbott -- who said in a statement he will sign it into law.Abbott's signature would add Texas -- where Republicans are seeking to hold onto power in one of the nation's fastest-growing and diversifying places -- to a list of states that includes Florida and Georgia attempting to seize on former President Donald Trump's lies about election fraud and enact restrictive laws this year.Democrats had fled from the state for weeks to prevent the House from having the quorum necessary to vote on the bill -- forcing Abbott to call the Legislature into two special sessions to address what the second-term Republican misleadingly characterized as \"election integrity,\" even though there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud in Texas.The latestTexas House approves GOP voting restrictions bill after months of Democratic delays What's in the restrictive voting bills being pushed by Texas GOP lawmakers?Fact check: Here are 20 things Texas Republicans' elections bill would do Eighteen states have enacted new laws that make it harder to vote. Texas is one of them.The bill \"will solidify trust and confidence in the outcome of our elections by making it easier to vote and harder to cheat,\" Abbott said in a statement Tuesday after the bill's final passage in the state House and Senate. \"I look forward to signing Senate Bill 1 into law, ensuring election integrity in Texas.\"Once several Democrats returned to the Capitol in Austin last week, the party was powerless to stop election law changes that its leaders say will impose burdens that fall disproportionately on minorities and people with disabilities.Read More\"I was born in segregation,\" Democratic state Rep. Garnet Coleman said before Tuesday's House before the vote. \"We think we've made progress, and then all of a sudden there's a new law that moves us back in time.\" RELATED: America's long history of Black voter suppressionSenate Bill 1 takes aim at Harris County, the home of Houston, which last year offered drive-thru voting and 24-hour early voting. The bill restricts the hours counties can offer early voting to between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. And it prohibits tactics like the ones Harris County used in 2020, when a garage at the Toyota Center -- the home of the Houston Rockets -- was used as a place residents could vote from their vehicles. The bill also blocks counties from sending unsolicited mail-in voting applications -- even to those who are over age 65 and therefore qualify automatically to vote by mail. It also places new rules around mail-in voting, increases protections for partisan poll watchers and sets new limits on those who help voters, including those with disabilities, to cast their ballots.The House's passage of SB 1 last week was the final major hurdle Republicans needed to clear. Then, the House and Senate hashed out the differences between the versions of the bill they'd approved in a conference committee, requiring both chambers to sign off on the final language. Eighteen states have enacted new laws that make it harder to voteRepublicans on the conference committee chose to remove a bipartisan amendment that would have prevented voter fraud charges against people who did not know their \"particular circumstances\" made them ineligible to vote.The amendment, which was adopted in the House without any debate, was created in response to the case of Crystal Mason, a Texas woman sentenced to five years in prison for voting while on supervised release from prison, even though she said she did not know she was ineligible to vote and the provisional ballot she cast never counted. The House passed the final bill Tuesday on an 80-41 vote, and hours later the Senate approved the bill with an 18-13 vote.RELATED: 56 years after the Voting Rights Act of 1965, lawmakers struggle to find common ground\"The right to vote is too precious, it costs too much, for us to leave it unprotected, unsecured,\" said state Sen. Bryan Hughes, the Republican author of the measure. \"This is a bill we can be proud of. It's going to help every voter.\"Democrats in Texas -- as the party's members have in other states -- said the only way to halt Republican laws that restrict voting access is for Congress to pass federal voting rights protections, which remain stalled on Capitol Hill. \"We knew we wouldn't be able to hold off this day forever. Now that it has come, we need the U.S. Senate to act immediately to pass federal legislation to protect Texas voters from Republicans' assault on our democracy,\" Texas House Democratic caucus chair Chris Turner said in a statement.",

It now moves back to the state Senate to iron out minor differences with the House's version of the bill before heading to the desk of Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, whose strong-arm tactics -- including calling lawmakers into two special sessions this summer with instructions to approve \"election integrity\" measures after the Democratic boycott had stymied earlier versions -- paved the way for the bill's passage.Opponents warned that the bill would make voting harder for people of color, who often back Democrats, as well as people with disabilities -- in part by outlawing the all-night and drive-thru voting that Houston conducted during the 2020 election. \"Make no mistake: This is your bill. Your idea. And you would be responsible for the consequences,\" Democratic state Rep. Senfronia Thompson, who recalled having to pay a poll tax to vote in Texas prior to 1966, said to her Republican colleagues. \"If you think that you're winning today by the things that you are putting in this bill, let me give you a prophetic statement: You will reap what you sow. And you know what? It won't be years or decades from now. It'll be sooner than you think.\" Friday's vote caps off this summer's showdown over voting rights, with Republicans in legislatures across the nation seeking to implement new restrictions in the wake of former President Donald Trump's lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election. Read MoreEighteen states have enacted new laws that make it harder to voteTexas Democrats are now in the same position as the party's lawmakers in Georgia, Florida and other states that have similarly approved restrictive voting laws this year: dependent on the party's national leaders to find a way past a Senate filibuster and enact nationwide voter protections.Texas House Democrats had tried for months to halt the GOP's bill. In the waning hours of Texas' legislative session in May, House Democrats bolted from the Capitol in Austin to block the chamber from having the quorum necessary to do business -- effectively running out the clock and blocking the bill's passage.Then, when Abbott called a 30-day special session to try again, those House Democrats fled to Washington, DC -- outside the reach of Republican Speaker Dade Phelan's order to have them arrested and compelled back into the House chamber to vote. The Democrats spent weeks in Washington organizing a pressure campaign to convince members of Congress to pass federal voting rights protections, which remain stalled on Capitol Hill.The six-week exodus ended after Abbott called a second special session and some Democrats broke ranks and returned to Austin, clearing the path for Republicans to move the measure in the House. Much of SB 1 targets the efforts of Harris County, the home of Houston, to make voting more accessible during the pandemic last year. The county opened drive-thru voting centers and allowed 24-hour early voting -- both of which the bill would prohibit, because it creates a window of 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. in which counties are allowed to conduct early voting.It prohibits local elections officials from sending unsolicited applications to vote by mail, including to voters over the age of 65 who are automatically eligible to cast mail-in ballots. It also places new rules around mail-in voting, increases protections for partisan poll watchers and sets new limits on those who help voters, including those with disabilities, to cast their ballots. The Republican bill authors have repeatedly said the legislation is designed to make it \"easier to vote, harder to cheat.\" There is no evidence of widespread voting fraud in Texas.\"We want Texans to be confident in the system,\" said Republican Rep. Andrew Murr, the bill's House sponsor.Opponents, including advocates for voting rights and for people with disabilities told a House committee this month that the bill would disproportionately place new burdens on marginalized groups -- and that the options the measure limits or prohibits were popular with Black and brown voters, including shift workers who cast votes after hours, last year. Democrats could not stop the bill in the Senate earlier this month, though state Sen. Carol Alvarado of Houston filibustered for 15 hours, without being able to take bathroom breaks or drink water.\"Do we want access to our electoral process to be more difficult for people with disabilities, or do we want to remove barriers for them?\" Alvarado said on the Senate floor. \"For communities of color, do we want to defend the tremendous progress that we've made in civil rights and equality or chip away at their voting rights one Senate bill at a time?\"In the House on Thursday, as lawmakers began 12 hours of debate on amendments, Phelan, the speaker, began the day by saying he \"would appreciate members not using the term 'racism' this afternoon.\" That admonishment incensed some Democrats, who have argued that a measure that disproportionately affects people of color is inherently racist. \"Intentional discrimination against people of a certain race -- is that racism?\" said Democratic state Rep. Gina Hinojosa. Republicans voted down dozens of Democratic amendments in the House throughout Thursday night, including proposals to allow same-day and automatic voter registration, allow students to use their college IDs to vote, create special voting conditions for people with Covid-19 and require racial impact studies on the changes to voting laws.The January 6 insurrection, in which Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol in an effort to overturn the 2020 election results, also came up during the Texas House's debate Thursday night. Democratic Rep. Erin Zwiener proposed an amendment that would have added to poll watchers' oath a pledge that they \"have never participated in or encouraged an act of insurrection against this state or the federal government.\" Republican Rep. Kyle Biedermann, who was pictured in Washington on that day, accused Zwiener of overstating what had happened on January 6.\"You were not there. You don't know what happened. All you do is listen to the liberal media,\" Biedermann said. Zwiener asked whether Biedermann believed what had happened on January 6 was an insurrection.\"Of course not,\" he said.",

        "content": "(CNN)Texas House Democrats' historic quorum break unexpectedly ended Thursday evening when at least three new Democrats returned to the floor, paving the way for state Republicans to pass restrictive voting legislation.The surprise turn of events quickly led to public accusations of betrayal among Democrats, as the House now has the required two-thirds of members necessary for a quorum. The voting legislation, which had been recently passed in the state's Republican-controlled Senate, was among the bills quickly referred to committees for action. The current special session ends early next month, and a public House committee hearing on the voting bill was originally scheduled for Saturday, but has since been rescheduled for Monday.It's the first time the Texas House has reached quorum since Democrats fled the state 38 days ago, which held up legislative business in the chamber and prompted Republican House Speaker Dade Phelan to sign civil arrest warrants for the 52 House Democrats who had fled the state in an effort to compel their return.Democratic Reps. Garnet Coleman, Ana Hernandez and Armando Walle released a joint statement explaining their return to the floor on Thursday, saying they were \"proud of the heroic work\" accomplished by breaking quorum but \"Now, we continue the fight on the House floor.\" The statement noted the need to manage the Covid-19 surge in the state as behind the decision. Coleman, who previously broke quorum but did not join others in DC due to a recent leg amputation, gave the invocation Thursday, saying in part, \"I pray that we, all of us look inside about where we want this world to go, this state, this House, and look at it from the perspective of trying to find as much common ground as can be found.\"Read MoreAt least two members publicly accused their three colleagues of blindsiding them with the decision to return, with Rep. Donna Howard replying to the statement on Twitter, \"This could have been shared with Caucus members beforehand.\"House Speaker Dade Phelan gavels in with a quorum present at the Capitol in Austin, Texas, on Thursday August 19, 2021.Rep. Ana-Maria Ramos went further, tweeting that, \"we were literally on caucus calls for 2 hours this morning and none of the defecting Democrats mentioned they were planning on helping the Republicans pass voter suppression bills. Guess what the other defecting Democrats have accomplished by going back\u2014NOTHING!\"Texas House Democratic Caucus Chair Chris Turner said Democrats' efforts had helped bring voting rights additional national awareness and vowed to continue to fight the GOP-led bill.\"By taking bold action and breaking quorum, House Democrats secured major victories for Texans and for voters across the country. Through our determination and unity, we derailed Gov. Abbott's entire first special session, preventing passage of anti-voter bills and other pointless, partisan legislation,\" Turner said in a statement. \"Through our continued efforts, we have already burned up a third of Abbott's second special session, which is nothing more than a prop for his re-election campaign.\"The speaker of the House signed 52 civil arrest warrants last week for Democrats absent without excuse. The House sergeant-at-arms deputized law enforcement to find the members and compel their attendance on the floor. While warrants have been delivered to the members, no arrests have been made. Several lawsuits and temporary orders preventing their arrests have been filed over the past week and a half, but Democrats' efforts have been repeatedly dashed by the all-Republican Texas Supreme Court. The Texas House Democrats successfully killed election overhaul bills during the regular session when they walked out in the final hours and in the first special session when they left the state last month. The members fled to Washington, DC, then, in part to avoid arrest since Texas law enforcement does not have jurisdiction outside of the state to execute a civil warrant. They spent weeks trying to put pressure on congressional lawmakers to pass federal voting rights protections. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott had vowed to call \"special session after special session\" until Democrats return and complete the agenda.The Texas Senate passed its version of the election overhaul bill, SB1, last week after a mostly symbolic 15-hour filibuster from Democratic state Sen. Carol Alvarado. It has since been effectively paralyzed, like all legislation coming out of the Senate, due to the lack of quorum in the House. SB1 includes broad new protection and access for partisan poll watchers, mail-in ballot restrictions, a drive-thru voting ban, restrictions to the early voting time frame, video surveillance and assistance restrictions. While the bill does add one extra required hour per day of early voting, it sets a specific time frame in which voting must be done -- banning extended hours and 24-hour voting, a measure used during the pandemic in Harris County that local officials testified was especially popular with voters of color. SB1 also further restricts local election officials, for example, adding criminal penalties for sending unsolicited ballot request forms. Some Democratic amendments, like a cure process for mail-in ballot mistakes, were accepted in the final version of the bill.This story has been updated to reflect the rescheduled public hearing on the voting bill.",

        "content": "Canton, North Carolina (CNN)Two people have died and searches for others are underway amid severe flooding in western North Carolina, where the remnants of Tropical Storm Fred swamped or washed away homes and roads, authorities said Thursday.About 20 people are unaccounted for in Haywood County west of Asheville after Fred slammed the area as a tropical depression on Tuesday, county authorities said.Gov. Roy Cooper, who toured the area Thursday, said two deceased victims had drowned. Officials have not released their names.About 250 rescuers, some using boats and drones, are searching for the missing in that county, state emergency management officials said. Stunned residents there -- as well as badly flooded Transylvania County nearby -- are taking stock of a changed landscape.Rushing floodwater swept away Cheri Mincey's Haywood County mobile home while she was still in it Tuesday, until it came to rest against a tree, she told CNN affiliate WLOS.Read More\"I lost everything. My clothes, my jewelry, everything,\" she told WLOS.Cooper said about 200 water rescues had been done.Around 35 people are unaccounted for after Fred floods western North Carolina\"The search and rescue efforts are not stopping until we know where people are or we've been able to find somebody,\" he said, adding that officials are utilizing cell phone tracking along with other ways of trying to find those unaccounted for or thought to be missing based on 911 calls.The flooding stemmed from heavy rain -- parts of western North Carolina received more than 10 inches from Sunday through Wednesday, the National Weather Service said.Rain exceeded 5 inches from Monday evening to Tuesday evening alone in the Haywood County community of Canton, the weather service said, swelling the Pigeon River to more than 9 feet above flood stage and the highest level since 2004.Flooding and washouts have done \"significant damage\" to county roads -- especially around the community of Cruso -- with 10 to 15 bridges damaged or destroyed, the county emergency services department said.Floodwater laps up against a damaged home in Canton, North Carolina, on Wednesday.  Cruso, about a 30-minute drive southwest of Asheville, \"saw some of the worst destruction in Haywood County that I've seen in my life,\" county Emergency Services Director Travis Donaldson told reporters Thursday in Canton.State transportation personnel are working to rebuild bridges and roads \"so we can get more help to people who truly need it,\" Haywood County Sheriff Greg Christopher said Thursday.The governor declared an emergency Wednesday for the state.The cleanup has begun and everyone is pitching inCasey Kruk, principal at Canton Middle School, told CNN a lot of damage was done to parts of the campus.  \"It looks like you've taken a snow globe and shaken it up and turned everything upside down,\" he told CNN while standing on the heavily damaged football field about 75 yards from the river.Volunteers on Thursday clear debris and try to salvage athletic equipment at the football field shared by Pisgah High School and Canton Middle School.He estimated 7 to 8 feet of water came through the area and classrooms in some schools were muddy messes. Hundreds of students, townspeople and folks from nearby counties came out to help clean up.\"People to come in here with a pair of work boots and start shoveling, that's what we need right now. Once we get that done we'll figure out what else we need,\" Krushsaid.Casey Conard, an assistant principal at Pisgah High School, which shares the football field with the middle school, said some of their classrooms had water damage. \"This is bad but the homes that are lost and the people, that's the big thing,\" he said. \"The people in our communities, they're just hurting right now.\"Thursday was a day for tearing down damaged fences and moving trash into big piles. Then the repairs would start.\"We'll get back. It'll take us a little while but we'll build it back,\" Kruk said.Art O'Neil, co-owner of BearWaters Brewing Company on the river, said the small brewery's packaging operations were submerged by the waters.\"We're still digging mud out of the basement,\" he said. All of the equipment down there will have to be taken out and assessed, and they'll see what they can save, he said. The beer lab, with its research and quality control equipment, was in the basement, too, he added.O'Neil said he feels violated. \"It'll bring you to tears,\" he said. \"It's what we put our life into.\"Inside the basement Thursday, some of the dozens of volunteers filled wheelbarrows with soupy mud, rolled it out and dumped it by the river. Donella Pressley's home in Bethel, 5 miles from Canton, was heavily damaged by the flood.'Like a nightmare; like we needed to build an ark'Haywood County authorities started responding to calls about high water Tuesday afternoon -- and soon had to help people from their homes, the sheriff said Wednesday. Several people were located safe and reunited with their families Wednesday, but several others were added to the list of unaccounted for throughout the day following the heavy flooding, officials said.2021 Atlantic Hurricane Season Fast Facts\"As the water level began to rise, a whole lot faster than I have ever saw it rise here in our county, we soon started to have to rescue people from their homes and provide additional assistance to our residents, and to our fire departments,\" Christopher said.In rural Transylvania County, water poured onto Susan Arnold's front yard \"like a rushing river,\" and ended up deluging most of her property, she told WLOS. \"Like a nightmare; like we needed to build an ark,\" Arnold told WLOS after water receded and her family set about cleaning the property.In Canton, a community of about 4,000, floodwater overturned machinery at American Cleaners and left thick mud on the floor, WLOS reported.\"It's going to take some money from somewhere to help bail us out, because nobody around here can absorb this kind of a loss out of their pocket,\" owner Tom Wilson told WLOS.Mincey, the Haywood County mobile home resident, recalled the moment floodwater carried the home away.\"All of a sudden, I'm floating! I don't have a steering wheel, I don't have a brake, I don't have anything to control it,\" Mincey told WLOS,She called 911, and she was told to stay on the highest piece of furniture. Rescuers retrieved her three hours later, and she stayed Wednesday at a high school gym being used as a shelter, WLOS reported.Crews rescue stranded drivers in Haywood County on Tuesday.A once-in-50-year rainfall rate in CantonThe rainfall rate in Canton exceeded 2.3 inches per hour on Tuesday afternoon, the National Weather Service said.Key takeaways from the UN report on the climate crisisThe 5-plus inches of rain that fell in 24 hours there would, in the past, occur only once every 50 years on average, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data.Rainfall rates, especially in landfalling tropical systems, are increasing due to human-caused climate change, scientists say, as warmer air is capable of holding more water vapor in the atmosphere. The most recent major report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change states that \"the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased since the 1950's over most land area ... and human-induced climate change is likely the main driver.\"Fred made landfall as a tropical storm in the Florida Panhandle at Cape San Blas on Monday afternoon with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph.

        "content": "Washington (CNN)The House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol Hill insurrection has information from multiple sources with firsthand knowledge that describe what then-President Donald Trump was doing during the riot, according to a person familiar with the investigation.\"There's a collection of people with relevant information,\" the source said.One key witness who has given a deposition is Keith Kellogg, then-Vice President Mike Pence's national security adviser, who was with Trump in the White House when the riot was happening. Kellogg, who was seen by reporters entering his December interview, told CNN on Sunday that he testified under oath to the committee but declined to comment about the substance of his deposition.The committee also has texts and other documents that shed light on what Trump was doing, according to the source. Some of those messages came from Mark Meadows, Trump's former chief of staff, who provided them to the panel. The House voted last month to refer Meadows to the Justice Department for criminal contempt of Congress after he failed to appear for a deposition. Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson and Vice Chairwoman Liz Cheney revealed the existence of some of those details on Sunday, making the case that the information underscores how Trump did nothing to stop the violence, which they see as a dereliction of duty.Read More\"We have significant testimony that leads us to believe that the White House had been told to do something,\" Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, told CNN's Dana Bash on \"State of the Union.\"\"We want to verify all of it so that when we produce our report and when we have the hearings, the public will have an opportunity to see for themselves,\" he said. \"The only thing I can say, it's highly unusual for anyone in charge of anything to watch what's going on and do nothing.\"Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, said the panel has \"firsthand testimony\" that during the attack Trump's daughter and then-senior adviser Ivanka Trump asked him to intervene. \"We know his daughter -- we have firsthand testimony that his daughter Ivanka went in at least twice to ask him to 'please stop this violence,'\" Cheney told ABC News' \"This Week.\" CNN previously reported on some of these interactions, described in the books \"I Alone Can Fix It,\" by Washington Post reporters Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker, and \"Peril,\" by Post journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa. Ivanka Trump repeatedly tried to intervene, talking to her father three times. \"Let this thing go,\" she told him. \"Let it go,\" she said, according to \"Peril.\"\"Any man who would not do so, any man who would provoke a violent assault on the Capitol to stop the counting of electoral votes, any man who would watch television as police officers were being beaten, as his supporters were invading the Capitol of the United States, is clearly unfit for future office, clearly can never be anywhere near the Oval Office ever again,\" Cheney added on ABC. The House select committee also previously revealed text messages from the former President's son, Donald Trump Jr., to Meadows stating that his father needed to \"condemn\" the insurrection as it unfolded.\"'He's got to condemn this sh*t ASAP. The Capitol Police tweet is not enough,'\" Trump Jr. wrote in one message to Meadows that Cheney read aloud last month as the committee was meeting to advance the criminal contempt report against Meadows for a full House floor vote. When Meadows had texted back that he agreed, Trump Jr. said, according to Cheney: \"We need an Oval office address. He has to lead now. It has gone too far and gotten out of hand.\"Only after pleading from aides and congressional allies inside the besieged Capitol on January 6 did the then-President release a taped video urging the mass of his supporters to \"go home,\" while still fanning their misplaced grievances about a stolen election.\"He could have simply walked a few feet to the White House briefing room. He could have gone immediately on live television and asked his supporters to stop what was happening, asked them to go home. He failed to do that,\" Cheney told CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday. \"At the same time the violent assault was happening, he is watching television, and he is also calling one senator urging delay of the electoral vote.\"CNN has previously reported that Trump spoke with Alabama Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville as the deadly riot was unfolding, trying to convince him to make additional objections to the Electoral College vote in a futile effort to block Congress' certification of President Joe Biden's win, according to a source familiar with the call. The select committee has interviewed scores of Trump allies and former officials as it works toward releasing an interim report with initial findings by the summer, a committee aide previously told CNN.Committee members have said that they hope to present more of their work in a public setting later this year, which would include public hearings that outline the story of what occurred on January 6. The specific timing of these hearings has not yet been set.CNN's Alex Marquardt and Paul LeBlanc contributed to this report.",

He did not respond to several questions during a break in his meeting, including if he plans to plead the Fifth.Along with Patel, members of the committee also met Thursday with \"Stop the Steal\" rally organizer Ali Alexander, conservative lawyer John Eastman and Chris Krebs, the former Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in the Department of Homeland Security.January 6 committee gets Meadows texts, emails with 'wide range' of people while attack was underwayThe depositions come as the committee is facing delay and stonewalling tactics from top Trump allies on multiple fronts, and though the committee has conducted nearly 300 interviews, many of their top profile targets have been granted postponements for their depositions as the parties involved work out the arrangements for their depositions.Patel was was first subpoenaed by the committee in September and has been going back-and-forth with the panel over what day he would be coming in. Patel previously served as an aide to Republican Rep. Devin Nunes of California.Read MoreAt the time of the subpoena, Patel said he was \"disappointed, but not surprised\" that the committee had subpoenaed him \"before seeking (his) voluntary cooperation.\"\"I will continue to tell the truth to the American people about the events of January 6th,\" he wrote at the time.He said in a Thursday night statement that he had appeared before the panel \"to answer questions to the best of my ability.\"Here's what pleading the Fifth is and what it means for the January 6 committee \"The DOD Inspector General, under the Biden Administration, found no wrongdoing in its report on Jan. 6, as I shared with the Committee,\" he added.CNN previously reported that the committee told Patel \"there is substantial reason to believe\" that he has important insight and information into how the Department of Defense and White House prepared for and responded to the attack at the US Capitol. The committee also said it wants to learn more about the direct communication Patel had with former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows on the day of the insurrection.The panel will begin the process of holding Meadows in criminal contempt next week after he reversed course and stopped cooperating with the committee, on top of Meadows filing a new lawsuit against the committee on Wednesday to block the subpoena against him.Alexander, Eastman and Krebs appearAlexander faced questions for most of the day after arriving for his meeting before 10 a.m. ET. He told reporters before entering that he planned to cooperate with the committee.Alexander's group had a permit on January 6 to hold a rally on the North East side of the Capitol grounds, but contends he played no part in the violence that took place on January 6.'Stop the Steal' rally organizer appears for deposition with January 6 committee and pledges to cooperateHe previously claimed that he worked closely with Republican congressmen in planning the rally at the Capitol on January 6. Alexander said on Periscope in December 2020 that he was in contact with Republican Reps. Paul Gosar of Arizona, Mo Brooks of Alabama and Andy Biggs of Arizona about the rally that preceded the riot.On Thursday, Alexander denied that he worked with lawmakers to attack the Capitol.Eastman, who helped craft a questionable legal theory that former Vice President Mike Pence had the constitutional authority to interrupt the certification of the 2020 presidential election results, appeared in person for a scheduled deposition with the panel, a source familiar with the meeting told CNN.Eastman's deposition was originally scheduled for Wednesday but postponed a day.He previously told the committee that he planned to plead the Fifth in response to their questions, and the committee did not give any indication that Eastman had changed his position.Krebs, the former top administration official for cybersecurity, whom Trump fired after the election, also appeared, a source familiar with the meeting told CNN. He has not been publicly subpoenaed by the committee.This story has been updated with additional reporting Thursday.CNN's Zachary Cohen, Ryan Nobles and Chandelis Duster contributed to this report.",

I place my arms under his, bend my knees and let him lean into me for balance as he straightens his legs and he's able to stand upright. He showers. But when he gets out of the shower, he slips and falls in his bedroom. He's seated on the ground in his bathrobe, helpless. I help him stand up.That was just one morning in my life 60 days ago. It's part of a series of scenes now stuck in my head over the past 100-plus days.The time he lost his balance, fell and cut his head when we were on a walk together.   The last time he climbed the stairs on his own, and the first night he had to sleep in a hospital bed in the living room. The night the health aide woke me up at three in the morning because he was coughing up blood. The last time he could stand on his own legs. The first time I had to give him morphine. The one ritual keeping me sane during Covid-19I became the primary caretaker for my father, terminally ill with brain cancer, when my mother died suddenly of a brain aneurysm in March. In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, I learned what it means to care for a dying parent in isolation, while still grieving for another parent.   It hasn't exactly been \"Tuesdays with Morrie.\" My dad didn't sit around telling me stories with beautiful life lessons. The brain tumor had already damaged his short-term memory and his emotional responses. He would often ask me where my mother was, and I would have to remind him that she died. He spent most days looking at his watch. I don't know if it's because he couldn't remember what time of day it was. Did he know it was 9 a.m.? Did it matter? It did remind me at least that time was running out.He couldn't hold a conversation. I could ask him questions and he might respond.  \"What year is it?\"\"2020,\" he told me. \"Who is the President?\"\"Ronald Reagan,\" he said. I told him I loved him. I rubbed his back. I kissed his forehead. Most of the time I had to just show my love by being there. I tried to cook his favorite foods -- or sometimes just order them. On more than one occasion I let him eat cupcakes for breakfast and ice cream for dinner. It's been over 100 days now.  Over 100 days without any visitors, just the two of us. Grieving for my mother in the age of Covid-19He's now in bed and unable to do anything. He's been like this for over a week. He's not eating or drinking. The last food he ate was some chocolate Jell-O pudding. At least it was chocolate. He loved chocolate. He looks so close to death.  His legs are shriveled up. There's no more muscle. His arms are just loose skin draped over a bone.     This isn't how I want to remember my dad. I want to remember him as the dad who would put on his Walkman and mow the lawn while screaming out Chuck Berry songs.   I want to remember him as the dad who took me to my first R-rated movie when I was five years old.   I want to remember him taking me on a business trip with him, staying up late, watching \"Hill Street Blues\" and ordering strawberry cheesecake from room service. I want to remember him picking me up from overnight camp because I was homesick by day three. I want to remember him as sarcastic and clever. I want to remember him telling my mother he didn't need to ask for directions.I want to remember him eating Oreos by the sleeve. I want to remember him getting angry when the ball went through Bill Buckner's legs in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series. I want to remember him spending endless hours on eBay trying to rebuild his entire childhood baseball card collection.I want to remember him taking my kids to Chuck E. Cheese while I was away on a Bahamas vacation, only to come home and find out that both kids had the flu because my dad definitely didn't make them wash their hands before they ate pizza.Get our free weekly newsletterSign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and FacebookTwo days before my dad took his last breath my wife and kids came to visit to say a final goodbye.

(CNN)\"This is so hard,\" my 4-year old daughter said to me in tears.It was her third straight day of crying like this. \"I want my friends and my toys,\" she said. Just weeks after my mother died suddenly of a ruptured brain aneurysm, we were still quarantined inside my parents' house, taking care of my father who is dying of brain cancer. Trapped inside the house my two kids once associated with being spoiled by their grandparents, the physical space was now haunting us -- my father's illness a constant reminder that another death was looming. Grieving for my mother in the age of Covid-19 Read MoreWhen my mother was alive, she used to entertain the kids from the moment they walked into the house until the moment they left. She always had new toys, puzzles and stuffed animals waiting for them. And she would go shopping for all their favorite foods -- mac and cheese, mangoes and ice cream -- before each visit.In her absence, that joy my kids once felt has disappeared.And while I've struggled to create new positive memories of my parents' house, I've found that having a few daily rituals helps to make the pain a bit more manageable. In my family, one ritual involves two scoops of ice cream each night. The five of us -- my dad, my wife, my kids and I -- all gather at the kitchen table, while I take orders scooping out bowls to them. Though the flavors vary, our current favorites are mint chocolate, butter pecan, peanut butter cup and caramel crunch. Of course, even a generous portion of ice cream can't heal a broken heart -- and my heart was already broken over losing my mother. Now my heart is breaking, preparing to lose my dad. But watching my kids grieving and suffering in isolation without many comforts of home, except for ice cream, has been my real breaking point.At the height of the coronavirus pandemic, it's been impossible to escape thinking about the thousands of loved ones who have been lost and not worry about the loved ones we could soon lose. Death is on everyone's minds these days. Mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, grandmothers and grandfathers are all dying from this invisible killer.In my case, my mom didn't die of coronavirus, and my father most likely will die from his brain cancer. But as the numbers of Covid-19 deaths in the United States continue to climb past 50,000, I can't help but be overwhelmed by the pain everyone feels from losing a loved one.\"It's OK to not be OK right now.\" A month of grief, worry and frustration\n Five weeks ago, the same day we buried my mother, I signed my father up for hospice care at home. The tumor in his brain was spreading fast, and there was no way to stop it. Discontinuing medical treatment for his aggressive brain tumor made even more sense with the coronavirus lockdown underway. It just wasn't worth it to him -- the risk of catching Covid-19 while trying one more experimental treatment.  I knew that my father was going to die -- at least since his diagnosis last June. It was a shock when we were told then and I think the grieving process began immediately. Even after surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, the tumor just kept growing. In the first few days after his brain surgery in 2019, I remember thinking that maybe I could sign him up for a clinical trial that would save him. But when I finally reached the head of cancer research at National Institutes of Health, he told me over the phone that so far nothing had worked. The cancer would eventually kill him.On March 16, the day of my mother's funeral, while hanging up my suit in the closet, I suddenly realized that I would probably need it again. Another funeral was soon approaching, and I would be living in this house and taking care of my dad until he was buried next to my mother.   You'd think that after 20 years as a journalist covering 9/11, the Iraq war, mass shootings and natural disasters, I wouldn't fear death -- but you'd be wrong. Even though I have produced hundreds of interviews with victims' families across the globe, death has always haunted me.It turns out that when it's finally your turn to lose a loved one, it hurts like you expected it would. But there's something more about the unexpected death -- the sudden loss that is much harder to believe. My mother was already brain dead by the time I made it to her ICU room. Her heart was still beating, but nothing in her body would ever work again. It was an \"unrecoverable event,\" the doctor told me. When they removed her breathing tube, I held my mother's hand as a wave of sadness enveloped me. There would be no more hugs, no more words of encouragement, no more advice, the kind I would need for a moment just like this. And that unconditional love, that only a mother can give, was gone in an instant. Now, each day I see my father growing weaker, his body shutting down. And yet at least I feel a bit more prepared. I know it's coming.I asked my father the other day what he'd rather be doing right now. \"Anything but this,\" he told me. So, to distract him -- and myself -- I turned to my new favorite activity, eating ice cream. My father, a notorious lover of sweets, perked up from the sugar rush. And, for a brief moment, I think he smiled once or twice. It turns out that ice cream could numb the pain.Get our free weekly newsletterSign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook No matter what, losing a loved one is hard.  It takes time to know how to deal with the loss. It takes time to know where to turn for the love and support that was always there for you.When you are in mourning, you crave the comforts of home. The trouble in my parents' home right now is that it's sending all the wrong messages. Some days I'm not even sure who I should be mourning -- my mom or my dad. Last week, I sent my wife and kids home so they could escape this haunted house.  I am still here with my dad.  All I know is my father was right when he told me he'd rather be doing \"anything but this\" right now. That's how we all feel, so excuse me while I get us both another scoop of ice cream.",

(CNN)For the past 10 months I had been planning my father's eulogy. I was rehearsing lines in my head, jotting down ideas when they came to me, trying to perfect it, so it would be just right for when the moment came. But in a cruel twist of events I was forced to write a eulogy for my mother with less than 24 hours' notice.It was my dad who was dying of brain cancer, but it was my mom who was now dead. And as the country was shutting down and canceling events because of coronavirus, I was now planning a funeral.David Gelles I always imagined my mom's funeral would be when she was in her late 90s. After all, my grandmother lived until she was 97 -- and pretty much outlived every one of her friends. She had good genes, everyone in the family had said. My mother was just 75, younger than some presidential candidates, and still had dozens of friends who wanted to attend her funeral. But Saturday, in the hours after she died, hours after I watched her take her last breath, I was furiously texting her friends and saying, please don't come to her funeral.The synagogue was closed. The funeral home was closed, and we could do only a graveside service. On top of everything, my father was in failing health and social distancing was an imperative.Read MoreI promised everyone we would hold a fitting memorial service when we made it out of Covid-19's wake. But it wasn't any comfort to me or them. Social distancing, while an important step to slowing the spread of the virus, has deepened the pain of what my family and I have lost. Instead, we gathered in the 48-degree windy March weather with a dozen family members and a rabbi as we said goodbye. We had a minyan (a gathering of 10 required for Jewish prayer), but barely. There were no hugs. No kisses. Social distancing is hard -- but patient distancing is heartbreakingAs we partook in the Jewish ritual of shoveling dirt on the grave, the rabbi noted that not everyone may want to touch the handle of the shovel. Some just used their bare hands to help spread dirt on the casket. After the funeral, I awkwardly elbow bumped the rabbi and we returned home to our quarantined quarters. Traditionally, Jews gather together in the home of the bereaved family and sit shiva. My earliest memory of a sitting shiva was after my grandfather died. I was 8. For seven days I hung out in my grandfather's living room eating cookies as the smell of smoked fish hung in the air. Now, in 2020, with coronavirus panic setting in, I consulted with my parents' rabbi, who agreed we couldn't have anyone come back to the house. The principle in Jewish law of pikuach nefesh, or the idea that preserving a human life overrides any strict religious rules, applied here --  and so we could not gather a large crowd to grieve together.There were just nine of us in the house after the funeral that day -- my mother's sister, her husband, and their daughter joined my father, my older brother, my wife and I, and our two kids.  Just like so many of the events playing out on cable news in 2020, it felt surreal. And, as I sat there, I could not help but replay the horrible chain of events that had transpired in the previous 24 hours.Why it's taking nearly three weeks for me to find out if I have the coronavirusI had gone to bed Friday night worried that if my mother died of coronavirus, I would become the sole caretaker for my father, who has terminal brain cancer.The call came Saturday morning from the hospital. My mother was in the ICU and had been declared brain dead. The doctor told me she had suffered a ruptured brain aneurysm, and it was a non-recoverable event.Early Friday, my mother had taken my father to the same hospital for a radiation treatment. When the procedure was over, my mother texted me. I texted back, \"Great. Wash your hands.\" I was freaked out over the thought of my mother being in a hospital and somehow catching Covid-19. Friday night, my father's doctor called to tell me they discovered more tumor growth in the most recent scan, and he had only one to six months to live. I called my mother, and she was distraught. She cried.At midnight, my mom said she had a headache and asked my father to call an ambulance. By the time she got to the ER, she could no longer talk or breathe on her own. The same neurosurgeon who had treated my father hours earlier was called in to evaluate my mother.Get our free weekly newsletterSign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and FacebookMy mom had been caring for my father around the clock since his diagnosis last June. I did everything I could to help her, but she took on the challenges of around-the-clock care. She told me there were many times when it was just too much to handle.  The doctors wouldn't confirm it, but I'm convinced my mother died because she couldn't bear to live without my father.  Everything has changed, people keep saying about living life with Covid-19 under lockdown and quarantine. But, in my particular case, it has made the sudden loss of my mother much more painful.",

        "content": "London (CNN)A London-based independent tribunal has ruled that China committed genocide against Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in its western Xinjiang region, accusing China's senior leadership including President Xi Jinping of \"primary responsibility\" for acts perpetrated against Muslim minority groups.\"The tribunal is satisfied that the PRC [People's Republic of China] has affected a deliberate, systematic and concerted policy with the object of so-called 'optimizing' the population in Xinjiang by the means of a long-term reduction of Uyghur and other ethnic minority populations to be achieved through limiting and reducing Uyghur births,\" Geoffrey Nice, who chaired the tribunal, said on Thursday as he read out the verdict. He added that the tribunal was \"satisfied that President Xi Jinping, Chen Quanguo and other very senior officials in the PRC and CCP [Chinese Communist Party] bear primary responsibility for acts in Xinjiang.\"While the \"perpetration of individual criminal acts that may have occurred, rape or torture, may not have been carried out with the detailed knowledge of the President and others, but the tribunal is satisfied that they have occurred as a direct result of politics, language and speeches promoted by President Xi and others and furthermore these policies could not have happened in a country with such rigid hierarchies as the PRC without implicit and explicit authority from the very top,\" he said. The judgment follows a series of tribunal hearings in London this year, during which a panel of jurors comprising of lawyers and academics among others reviewed evidence and testimony. Read MoreThe non-governmental Uyghur Tribunal was founded in 2020 by Nice, a British barrister and international human rights lawyer, at the urging of Uyghur activists.Nice was among several British individuals and entities sanctioned by the Chinese government in March this year in retaliation for British sanctions on Chinese officials over human rights violations in Xinjiang.The tribunal has no powers of sanction or enforcement, but vowed to \"act wholly independently\" and \"confine itself to reviewing evidence in order to reach an impartial and considered judgment on whether international crimes are proved to have been committed\" by China, according to its website.Members of the panel take their seats for the first day of hearings at the Uyghur Tribunal on June 4, 2021.China's ambassador to the United Kingdom, Zheng Zeguang, has called the Uyghur Tribunal a \"political manipulation aimed at discrediting China.\" \"The organization has been designed to tarnish the image of China, mislead the public here, spoil the goodwill between the Chinese people and the British people and disrupt the smooth development of the China-UK relationship,\" Zheng said at a news conference in September. Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, has called the tribunal a \"pure anti-China farce.\" On Thursday, the Chinese Embassy in London called the tribunal \"a political tool used by a few anti-China elements to deceive and mislead the public. It is not a legal institution. Nor does it have any legal authority.\"It added that the Xinjiang region \"now enjoys economic progress, social stability and ethnic solidarity. China will remain focused on doing the right thing and following the path that suits its national reality.\"The United States State Department estimates up to 2 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities have passed through a sprawling network of detention centers across Xinjiang, where former detainees allege they were subjected to intense political indoctrination, forced labor, torture, and even sexual abuse. Human rights groups and overseas Uyghur activists have also accused the Chinese government of forced cultural assimilation and coerced birth control and sterilization against Uyghurs.The US government has accused China of committing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, as have lawmakers and rights groups in the UK and Canada.Beijing vehemently denies allegations of human rights abuses, insisting the camps are voluntary \"vocational training centers\" designed to stamp out religious extremism and terrorism.In March, the US along with the European Union, Canada and the UK announced sanctions on Chinese officials over human rights violations in Xinjiang. China responded almost immediately by imposing a raft of tit-for-tat sanctions, as well as travel and business bans. As the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics approaches, international pressure over China's treatment of Uyghurs has been building, with activists calling for a boycott of the Games.On Monday, the Biden administration said it would not send an official US delegation to the Games as a statement against China's \"ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang\" -- though American athletes will still be allowed to compete in Beijing.Since then, Australia, the UK and Canada have joined the US in the diplomatic boycott. At a news conference Wednesday, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said \"human rights abuses and issues in Xinjiang\" were some of the concerns raised by the Australian government with Beijing.Also on Wednesday, the US House of Representatives passed a bill that would ban the importation of goods from Xinjiang over concerns about forced labor. The \"Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act\" was passed by an overwhelming 428-1. It must also pass the Senate and be signed by US President Joe Biden to become law.CNN's Ben Westcott contributed to this story",

Heart-shaped pink and white balloons floated around her 25th-floor apartment on February 23, the night of the party.  At nearly nine months pregnant with her first child -- a baby girl she's already calling Kyra -- Ostafieva said tiny kicks jolted her awake every few hours.Then around 5 a.m. on February 24, she heard a loud boom. Her sister was visiting, and Ostafieva rushed to her room to ask about the noise.\"She said, 'It's bombs,'\" Ostafieva said. \"It was a shock for me. We didn't know ... what we must do.\"And so began a terrifying ordeal that took Ostafieva, her dog, Casper, and her sister, Iryna Ostafieva, to a bomb shelter for four days, followed by a week-long journey to Poland, and eventually the United States. Olesya Ostafieva had prepared a nursery for her baby, Kyra, in Kyiv, Ukraine. Read MoreNearly three weeks after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an invasion that stunned the world, Olesya Ostafieva is 5,000 miles away in New York City.She thought the attack would last a few daysWhen Russian forces invaded Ukraine, she initially assumed it would be over quickly. She planned to stay in her apartment in Kyiv, where a pink and white baby room was ready for Kyra's arrival. Newborn outfits -- mostly in pale pinks -- laid neatly stacked in a white drawer.\"I had a contract with the best maternity hospital in Kiev,\"  she told CNN from a friend's New York City home. But the shelling raged. The maternity hospital where she planned to deliver Kyra was bombed. Terrified, the two sisters and Casper hid in a bomb shelter in the basement of Ostafieva's apartment. After a few days of relentless attacks, they decided to escape to Poland. Ostafieva drove in bumper-to-bumper traffic for about 10 hours a day. \"I forgot about all pain.

She was left bleeding from the brain and with a fractured skull in what they described as a brutal and unprovoked attack.An NYPD spokesperson told CNN Sunday William Blount, 57, had been arrested over the attack after police conducted extensive video canvassing across the city.Blount was arrested at his registered place of residence, which police described as a \"shelter.\"The NYPD spokesperson said police are recommending charges of attempted murder, robbery and assault for Blount.Read MoreBlount has not yet been arraigned, Kim Livingston, a spokeswoman for the Queens District Attorney's Office, said, adding a complaint for his case has yet to be written. As such, Blount does not yet retain legal representation, Livingston said. Blount is scheduled to appear in court Monday, at which time his counsel will then be identified, according to Livingston.NYPD Chief of Detectives James Essig said at a news conference Friday afternoon the suspect had kicked the woman and struck her \"numerous times\" before fleeing on foot with her purse.The woman's family identified her as Nina Rothschild, a scientist for the New York City Department of Health. She was attacked just 15 minutes after leaving work, police said.At least 6 NYC subway stabbings reported since the mayor unveiled new safety plan Friday\"This is an unprovoked, brutal and appalling crime on a woman who was just trying to get home after a day's work,\" Essig said.Rothschild, who was bleeding from her brain, was taken to Cornell Medical Center with a fractured skull and lacerations to her face, Essig said.

It is unclear whether it was nerve damage or a mental block, he said.\"Of course, I can't wish this on someone else, it shouldn't happen to anyone,\" Gerson Rothschild told CNN on Saturday. \"I wish it wasn't my sister, but we have to deal with what we have.\" The sibling pair lost their parents within 29 days of each other in 2000. \"It's just Nina and me, basically it's just the two of us,\" Gerson Rothschild said. \"Little brother will do whatever he can to protect big sister.\"54% increase in transit system arrests compared to the same time last year, NYPD saysChief of the NYPD Transit Bureau Jason Wilcox said additional patrols will be added in all boroughs but noted the Queens Plaza station where the incident took place is \"a priority station\" given it is heavily trafficked.\"We are definitely working very hard to increase uniform presence throughout the system, on the trains, on the platforms, along the mezzanines, in the stairs, so it is an absolute priority,\" Wilcox said. The presence of more officers will make people feel safer, Wilcox added. \"My directive and our mission is to be highly visible, on the trains, on the platforms moving around, taking train runs from other stations, so that's what we're very dedicated towards,\" he said.  There have been more than 1,000 arrests in the transit system so far this year, Wilcox said, a 54% increase compared to data from the same time last year.Attack happened one week after new transit safety plan announcedThe attack happened a week after officials unveiled a new transit safety plan to combat crime and address homelessness in the city's transit system as part of a new public safety initiative.Mayor Eric Adams said Friday the objective is to go after people who violate basic rules, who don't allow \"the system to function in a clean, safe manner.\"Adams said safety crews are operating overnight and will target all crimes from fare evasion to smoking on the subway. Gerson Rothschild said he is \"all for\" the safety plan.\"The thing is, I just think it's a little early to see results, we just need to give him a little more time. ... Hopefully, my sister will be the last to be attacked.\" \"It's a big city, you're going to have something happen whether it's under [Rudy] Giuliani, [Bill] de Blasio or [Eric] Adams, bad things happen,\" Gerson Rothschild said. \"I just hope that the perpetrator is caught and punished.\" Mayor Adams said he was \"really angry\" about the attack on Rothschild, and tweeted that the incident was \"particularly horrific.\" \"Violence against any New Yorker is unacceptable but an attack of a city worker who has dedicated her work to keeping people safe is particularly horrific,\" the mayor tweeted.CNN's Susannah Cullinane contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)The second New York Police Department officer who was shot while responding to a domestic incident in Harlem last week has died, the NYPD commissioner said.\"It's with great sadness I announce the passing of Police Officer Wilbert Mora,\" NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell said on Twitter. \"Wilbert is 3 times a hero. For choosing a life of service. For sacrificing his life to protect others. For giving life even in death through organ donation. Our heads are bowed & our hearts are heavy.\"Mora, 27, and Officer Jason Rivera, 22, were fatally shot Friday when a suspected gunman opened fire in a Harlem apartment, authorities said. The suspect, Lashawn McNeil, tried to run but was confronted and shot by a third officer on the scene, police said. McNeil died on Monday.Mora and Rivera are just two of five NYPD officers who have been shot in the nation's largest city in the first month of 2022. In addition, a woman was pushed onto the subway tracks in Times Square and a baby was hit in the face by crossfire in the Bronx.NYPD officers Jason Rivera (left) and Wilbert Mora were killed in a shooting in Harlem on Friday.These acts of violence under a new city administration -- coming off a year that saw an increase in homicides -- have dramatically changed the tenor of policing in New York City over the course of just a few days. Read MoreNow, as officials enact plans to stem violent crime and illegal gun ownership, the city is preparing for the return of plainclothes units that had been disbanded nearly two years earlier. Mayor Eric Adams, a former New York Police Department captain who began his term less than four weeks ago, touted his law and order experience during the election campaign. Now, lawlessness has become his biggest immediate challenge following a spate of high-profile attacks on residents and police alike. Attacks at subway stations -- with people being pushed onto the tracks -- has transportation officials warning riders to stay away from the edge of platforms.  Eric Adams has been mayor of NYC for 24 days. He's already at a crossroads\"I don't want to tell people that they should stand on subway platforms and feel like they're, you know, they're in threat of their lives,\" Metropolitan Transit Authority chair and CEO Janno Lieber told CNN affiliate WABC on Sunday. \"But everybody should stand away from the edge of the platform.\"To try to provide greater security on city streets, Adams said a plainclothes unit will be reinstituted within the next three weeks to curb rising crime and gun violence. \"We have to make sure we don't continue to put dangerous people back on the street and continue the flow of guns in our cities,\" Adams told CNN's John Berman on Tuesday on \"New Day.\"The unit will patrol in unmarked vehicles while wearing clothing identifying officers as law enforcement, Adams announced Monday, adding that the new unit will be in addition to those already on the streets since August who patrol in unmarked vehicles while wearing police uniforms.The mayor also laid out in a \"Blueprint to End Gun Violence\" goals to improve mental health care, launch a new youth engagement program to intercept those at risk from potential criminal behavior, improve communication between legal jurisdictions and increase the number of judges available.\"New Yorkers will see and feel these changes quickly,\" Adams said. \"We will ramp up enforcement, deploy more officers on the streets and in the subways, and get our courts at full capacity.\"Shooting of two officers spurred city actionMayor Eric Adams speaks to hundreds of police and fire officers at a vigil on January 22, 2022, for two officers shot in Harlem While Adams made no secret during his campaign that he wanted a more active police force, the speed in which events were put in motion was hastened by the shooting death of Officer Rivera on Friday.The gun used in Friday's shooting, a Glock 45, was stolen from Baltimore in 2017 and had a magazine that can hold up to 40 additional rounds, according to NYPD Chief of Detectives James Essig. The suspect had another gun under his mattress, Adams said Monday.\"He could have emptied out his 40 (bullets) and still had another automatic assault weapon for every responding officer who responded,\" he said.The availability of illegal firearms has been paid particular attention, with Gov. Kathy Hochul announcing a multistate effort with federal authorities to get more weapons off the street. Jason Rivera, the 22-year-old NYPD officer killed in the line of duty, devoted his life to helping othersServices for Rivera will take place Thursday and Friday at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York, the Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York said.Sewell, the NYPD Commissioner, announced Mora's death in an internal memo provided to CNN by a law enforcement official.\"The grief in this Department is incalculable. We will stand, salute and shed tears, yet manage to smile as we remember him during the extremely difficult days ahead,\" she said.\"Police officers Wilbert Mora and Jason Rivera were dedicated, courageous and compassionate officers, loved by many. The pain their families feel is immeasurable. We pray for them; we will be strong for them.\"\"You put yourselves in harm's way every day to make this city safer. You are honoring the legacy and sacrifice of Jason and Wilbert, all while keeping our solemn vow to never forget our two fallen heroes.\"New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement that Mora was \"a hero until the end.\"\"Officer Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera, showed courage in the face of imminent danger to protect New Yorkers,\" James said. \"Their bravery exemplified their commitment to protecting the city they loved. Both will forever be remembered as heroes who dedicated their lives to making New York safer and stronger,\" James said.Patrick Lynch, the president of the Police Benevolent Association police union, said Mora \"will live on in the heart of every New York City police officer from this day forward\" and that he \"showed us what it means to carry out our mission with courage, skill and humanity.\"Critics worry new units will be a return to old waysJUST WATCHEDSee NYC mayor's remarks after NYPD officer was killedReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSee NYC mayor's remarks after NYPD officer was killed 01:56As the city moves forward with the return of plainclothes units, some community leaders and advocates are questioning whether the mayor's plan is an appropriate course of action. Some critics derided plainclothes units for years as counterproductive and argued they were a relic from the stop-and-frisk era of policing, used instead as a bludgeoning tool that more negatively affected Black and brown communities. Rivera had prior experience with the stop-and-frisk policy before joining the force. Writing to a commanding officer while in police academy less than two years ago, he detailed a negative experience with his brother who was frisked, and said he was moved by later NYPD efforts to get away from such tactics. Domestic incidents are highly dangerous for police officers, experts say He wanted to be the first person in his family to become a police officer in what he called \"the greatest police force in the world,\" he wrote, intent on pursuing a career.The NYPD reassigned plainclothes officers off such assignments in 2020, closing a controversial chapter of the city's anti-crime units. And a group of public defender groups -- while lauding other aspects of the mayor's initiative on mental health and youth services -- expressed reservations about bringing back such units. \"Reinstating the NYPD's Anti-Crime Unit without also addressing the culture and policies that drove that unit's decades-long pattern of harassment and violence targeting Black and brown New Yorkers is a mistake,\" The Legal Aid Society, Brooklyn Defender Services, The Bronx Defenders and The Neighborhood Defender Service of Harlem and Queens Defenders said in a joint statement Monday.\"Today's announcement gives the community members who live with the legacy of hyper-aggressive policing no comfort that Mayor Adams's Anti-Crime Unit will be different from its predecessors,\" the statement said. \"The Mayor must focus on addressing long standing problems with NYPD's culture of impunity before he doubles down on strategies that will only perpetuate the harms of that culture.\"Mayor has 'unique ability and credibility'The rise in violent crime and the recent shootings of police officers are not unprecedented circumstances for a New York City mayor who is just taking office, according to Susan Kang, associate professor of political science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.  What is unique, Kang said, is how quickly the five shootings occurred within just a short period of time after Adams was inaugurated.  \"In terms of a political narrative and the way it dominates the news cycle, it's certainly making a strong impression on people's assessment of Mayor Adams,\" Kang said.  Mayor Eric Adams acknowledges New Yorkers don't feel safe in the subways\"The increased perceptions of violence matter and they put Adams in a tough spot because he really sold himself as the guy who would make public safety a backbone of his campaign,\" she added. \"I think it was a mistake because a lot of aspects of public safety are not related to things that a mayor can necessarily do. A lot of it has to do with larger socioeconomic issues.\"  Kang said Adams is tasked with figuring out a way to \"placate his critics\" as there are concerns police reform efforts will be scaled backward in an \"attempt to weed out the gun violence.\"  Stu Loeser, former press secretary for Mayor Michael Bloomberg, told CNN that the recent shootings of NYPD officers have presented Adams with the right time and public attention to roll out his policing agenda.  \"I don't think any mayor other than Eric Adams, in his third week in office, could propose a massive reshaping of criminal justice reform in New York,\" Loeser said.  Adams' mayoral campaign focused on the message that he has the \"unique ability and credibility\" to spur changes in policing while improving public safety, Loeser said.  \"He knows more about policing than anyone else in politics,\" he said. \"He ran on the premise that he was able to fix this as a career police officer, as someone who performed within the police department throughout his career.\"  America's crime wave tests both partiesIn an interview before Mora's death was announced, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards told CNN the fatal shooting of Rivera, who wanted to improve the relationship between officers and the public, \"struck a different chord\" across the city in many Black and Brown communities that continue to call for better policing.   \"As we talk about crime perception versus reality, when we see officers being shot -- whether it's a perception problem, whether murders are down, whether shootings are down, is beside the question,\" Richards said. \"If the people who we trust to protect us and serve us are not safe in the streets, how can the everyday New Yorker walk down the block and feel safe?\" Adams, who is only the second Black mayor in the city's history, has said he is keenly aware of overcoming the gaps between communities and a police agency historically at odds.  \"There's a subtext to this story that I don't want to be missed,\" he said at a vigil for the officers Saturday. \"The three officers that were involved, two of them were born outside this country, one in India and one in the Dominican Republic, the third is a first generation.\"\"And so when you start talking about the contribution of the immigrant community to this city, you better understand the reality that they are putting their lives on the line for the city and country that they love,\" he said.

Speaking Saturday, Adams reinforced the point that he's dedicated to unite everyone around the issue of gun violence. \"We can have philosophical disagreements about things, but you can't have a disagreement about a gun,\" Adams said. \"An illegal gun is a line in the sand and we need to send a clear and loud message. ...

        "content": "(CNN)A malfunctioning electric space heater in a bedroom was the source of an apartment building fire Sunday in the Bronx that killed 17 people, including 8 children, making it one of the worst fires in the city's history, New York Mayor Eric Adams said Monday.Adams revised the death toll Monday down from 19, saying it was an evolving situation. A CNN review of local hospitals shows that at least eight patients are still hospitalized in relation to the fire, while at least 25 people have been treated and released.Now, the building's fire alarms and a series of open doors are on the radar of investigators and officials probing the second major deadly fire in a week in the Northeast.The Bronx blaze was deemed the second most deadly US home fire in nearly 40 years by the National Fire Protection Association. The NFPA also reported that heating equipment is the second-leading cause of US home fires and the third-leading cause of home fire deaths and injuries.Desperate families are searching for answers after deadly Bronx apartment blaze\"This is a horrific, horrific, painful moment for the city of New York, and the impact of this fire is going to really bring a level of just pain and despair in our city,\" Adams said Sunday.Read MoreMany of those in the building were Muslim immigrants from the West African nation of The Gambia. The country's ambassador told CNN the building had been a beloved home for many such immigrants over the years.\"I think a lot of Gambians who came here, they stayed there before they moved anywhere else. This was kind of a first port of call, this building. It's a building Gambians have a lot of attachment to,\" said Ambassador Dawda Docka Fadera, who traveled from Washington to New York after learning of the fire.The families in the apartment complex and neighborhood told CNN they were devastated. Some are still searching for loved ones, and all are desperate for answers. \"I'm totally worried and devastated \u2014 not me alone, but the whole community and the family at large. Everybody's worried. We don't know what happened. ... That's the toughest thing -- not knowing,\" says Yusupha Jawara, who spoke with CNN at a mosque where many were praying for the victims.Live updates: The latest on the Bronx apartment fireThe Red Cross has provided emergency housing to 22 families, representing 56 adults and 25 children, the group said in a statement.

This (the space heater) was being used to supplement the building heat. There were smoke alarms throughout the building. The first call that came in was due to a neighbor hearing the smoke alarm and looking and seeing the smoke and calling,\" he said.When residents left the fiery unit, the apartment door was left open, allowing the blaze to spread, Nigro said. The fire was contained to that hallway, but the smoke traveled upwards and took over much of the building. The doors were supposed to close automatically, but the apartment door as well as the door from the stairwell to the 15th floor were not functioning properly, Nigro said Monday.Bronx fire leaves 19 people dead\"The smoke spread throughout the building, thus, the tremendous loss of life and other people fighting for their lives right now in hospitals all over the Bronx,\" he said. \"So, we are investigating where everyone was found, how the smoke traveled, but certainly the marshals have determined through physical evidence and through firsthand accounts by the residents that this fire started in the bedroom, in a portable electric heater.\"About 200 members of the FDNY responded to the fire at 333 East 181st Street, the agency said. Units arrived at the scene within three minutes of getting an emergency call, Nigro said. They \"found victims on every floor in stairways,\" he said, many of them in cardiac and respiratory arrest.\"It was a very difficult job for our members. Their air tanks contained a certain amount of air -- they ran out of air, many of our members -- and they continued working to try to get as many people out as they could,\" he said.Residents say they narrowly escaped smoke and flamesEmergency personnel work Sunday at the scene of the fatal Bronx fire.Daisy Mitchell, a 10th-floor resident who had just moved in to the building, was one of those who fled to safety. She told CNN's Brianna Keilar her husband first smelled smoke and noticed the fire.\"The alarm was going off for a while so I didn't pay it no mind,\" she said. \"Then, when he opened the door and I went out there, I passed out \u2014 it was devastating, it was like really scary.\"\"I went to the stairs, I opened the door, it just blew me back [to] the house,\" she added. \"If I'd stayed out there for another three seconds, I would have been gone too.\"It was common for fire alarms to go off in the building, 10th-floor resident Chanasia Hunter told CNN affiliate WABC. \"So, when you don't know that it's a fire, like, you know, how would you supposed to know if it's a fire or if it's always going off?\" said Hunter, adding she got a call from a resident on the third floor warning her of the fire, then a knock on her door telling her and her family to get out.Karen Dejesus lives on the same floor as the apartment that caught fire and said the flames encroached on her residence. Two US Northeast cities are reeling from fires that killed dozens\"I can see the flames, I can see the smoke and everything, you know, coming into my apartment,\" Dejesus said. \"You're being trapped somewhere. As you see, we have no fire escapes, obviously the building was not fireproof like we thought it was.\"Dejesus said firefighters broke down her door to rescue her, her granddaughter and her son. They had to climb out of a window to escape the flames.She, too, noted fire alarms in the building often went off.\"So many of us were used to hearing that fire alarm go off so it was like second nature to us,\" she said. \"Not until I actually seen the smoke coming in the door, I realized it was a real fire and I heard people yelling help, help, help.\"\"I thank God that me and my family are safe,\" said Dejesus. \"I'm sorry for all of my neighbors that didn't make it, I'm sorry for my neighbors that are still in the hospital fighting for their life. This was crazy, this was so scary.\"Fire alarms and self-closing doors are focus of investigationInvestigators are examining potential issues with the fire alarms and with self-closing doors designed to contain fire and smoke.Reports of smoke alarms frequently malfunctioning will be looked into, Nigro said, adding he couldn't confirm them.The building had no fire escapes, but \"there are interior stairways,\" he said. \"So, the residents should know where the stairwells are, and I think some of them could not escape because of the volume of smoke.\"Mayor Adams, speaking to CNN's Brianna Keilar, said fire marshals will investigate the self-closing doors in the building to see if there was a malfunction. New York passed a law in 2018 making self-closing doors a requirement in buildings with three or more apartments.Here are ways you can help the victims of the Bronx Fire\"We have a law here in NYC that requires doors to close automatically,\" he said. \"We also want to double down on that PSA that I recall as a child... close the doors,\" he said.There have been no major building violations or complaints listed against the building, which contains 120 units, according to city building records. Past minor violations were rectified by the property, and no structural violations were listed.Built in 1972, the building was federally funded, so may have been built outside the New York City fire code, Nigro said, adding it was unlikely to have been a factor in Sunday's blaze. \"Certain federal buildings can be built under different standards. But to be perfectly clear, the fire itself -- other than getting in the hall because the door was open -- never extended anywhere else in the building, so that was not a factor.\"At a news conference Monday, New York firefighter union representatives confirmed the building was not required to adhere to city fire codes. \"There was different fire protection in this building than we have in tenements and other high rises under the New York City code,\" said Jim McCarthy, president of the FDNY Fire Officers Association. \"So it exposed members to a more dangerous atmosphere.\"Life-saving fire protection devises like sprinkler systems were oftentimes not a requirement in older buildings, McCarthy said.Many older buildings in the city have been retrofitted with sprinklers, McCarthy said. It doesn't appear this building had a sprinkler system installed, according to Andrew Ansbro, president of the Uniformed Firefighters Association.For the victims, the city will work to ensure Islamic funeral and burial rites are respected and will seek Muslim leaders to connect with residents, said Adams, who took office only this month. The names of those who request government assistance will not be turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, he added.Residents of the apartment building were initially housed at a middle school next door, and longer-term shelter for them would be found, said Christina Farrell, first deputy commissioner of NYC emergency management.Low-income areas face higher fire risk, official saysThe \"tragic and terrifying\" fire underscores the need for federal investment in affordable housing, said Congressman Ritchie Torres, who represents residents of the apartment building.\"Many of these buildings are old. Not every apartment has a fire alarm. Most of these buildings have no sprinkler system. And so the risk of a fire is much higher in lower-income neighborhoods in the Bronx than it might be elsewhere in the city or in the country,\" Torres told MSNBC. \"When we allow our affordable housing developments to be plagued by decades of disinvestment, we are putting lives at risk. These buildings are wide open to catastrophic fires that can cost people their lives, including the lives of children.\" The Bronx has been the scene of other grave fires in recent decades -- the most deadly in 1990, when 87 people died at the Happy Land social club. In 2007, 10 people -- nine of them children -- were killed in a fire at a residence after a space heater cord overheated.In December 2017, 13 people died when a fire broke out at an apartment block. The fatal fire began when a 3-year-old played with burners on the stove and started a kitchen fire, officials said. When the boy's mother fled the apartment with him and his 2-year-old sister, she left the door open.The apartment's stairway acted \"like a chimney,\" and the fire rapidly spread through the apartment building, Nigro said at the time. After that fire, the city passed the self-closing door law.CNN's Alaa Elassar, Sarah Fortinsky, Elizabeth Joseph, Eric Levenson, Artemis Moshtaghian, Liam Reilly, Taylor Romine, Catherine Shoichet and Laura Studley contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Omar Soriano has waited 22 years for good news from police about his younger cousin Minerliz, ever since that winter day in 1999 when the 13-year-old never returned home from school. Her body was found in a Bronx, New York, dumpster days after she went missing, prompting an exhaustive investigation that went cold but was reignited nearly four years ago. \"It's been an open festering wound,\" Soriano said, as he recalled the years he spent with his younger cousin, braiding her hair and playing together, and the times he walked her to elementary school. \"Minnie,\" as she was known, was like a sister to him. Soriano got emotional at times Tuesday as city officials announced they had finally found Minerliz Soriano's killer, identifying him as a former resident of the building where she lived. Officials with the NYPD and Bronx District Attorney's office said they solved the crime by using familial DNA, hitting a historical milestone for the city, which had never closed a case by using the investigative technique.  Read MoreMinerliz Soriano, a seventh-grader in the Bronx, never made it home from school on February 24, 1999.\"This case brings together modern science and traditional investigative work along with the determination to never give up on justice for an innocent little girl,\" Inspector Neteis Gilbert said at a news conference. Joseph Martinez, now 49, was arraigned Tuesday on two charges of second-degree murder after a grand jury returned an indictment in the case. Martinez pleaded not guilty and is being held without bail until his next court date in March.  \"He has no criminal history in his entire 49 years,\" his court-appointed attorney Troy Smith told CNN. \"This is shocking to say the least and he maintains his innocence.\" For investigators, cracking open the case took years of work. The NYPD's Bronx Homicide Squad began to reexamine Minerliz's case in February 2018 and granted CNN rare access to their efforts, including exclusive interviews with detectives and witnesses, a review of parts of the case file and access to pieces of evidence. What emerged was a case that showed how science and old-fashioned detective work could provide justice for the \"sweet\" 13-year-old girl who wrote poems in her journals about love, rainbows and the stars. Familial DNA match comes back to suspect's father What happened to Minerliz eluded detectives both current and retired. Over the years, NYPD investigators interviewed numerous witnesses, chased hundreds of leads, even collected DNA samples from more than a dozen potential suspects before the familial DNA match ultimately led them to Martinez, said NYPD Lt. Sean O'Toole, commanding officer of the Bronx Homicide Squad. New York state approved the use of familial DNA in 2017. The investigative tool allows law enforcement to run DNA through an advanced software program to see if the DNA matches any male relatives in New York's database who have been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor crime. Joseph Martinez calls himself \"Jupiter Joe\" online. He advertises a sidewalk astronomy business.By comparing the DNA from a sample of semen taken from Minerliz's sweatshirt that she was wearing at the crime scene, the state was able to provide police with a familial DNA result, officials say.  It came back as a match to Martinez's father, who was in the state's DNA database for a previous conviction, according to Deputy Chief Emanuel Katranakis, who leads the Forensic Investigation Division at the NYPD. Authorities were then able to home in on Martinez after detectives legally collected an abandoned DNA sample, resulting in a direct match to the sample taken from Minerliz's clothing, Katranakis said. Independent group claims it solved the mystery behind the identity of the Zodiac Killer as law enforcement investigates\"It is unequivocal that this individual deposited his DNA in the form of semen on the front of the victim's sweatshirt,\" he said.    Earlier this week, Martinez, of New Rochelle, New York, a New York City suburb, voluntarily met with homicide detectives to discuss the case, sources said, and he denied having any physical contact with Minerliz. Martinez, or \"Jupiter Joe\" as he calls himself online, advertises a sidewalk astronomy business. He offers private and public astronomy observing sessions and party planning services.  Numerous local media outlets have featured Martinez setting up his telescope on subway platforms and trains, providing free lessons to New Yorkers -- something his social media accounts show he was doing as recently as mid-November. 'She was so bubbly, just a sweet person'  Minerliz, a seventh-grader living in the Bronx, was described by one friend as mature for her age, someone who took on many family responsibilities, like running late night errands, doing laundry and caring for her younger sister, Nadia.  \"She was so bubbly, just a sweet person in general. She always wanted to help, especially with poetry. She was so natural at it,\" her classmate Kimberly Ortiz said.  Ortiz said the two of them bonded in an after-school program. She remembers when she last saw Minerliz. It was February 24, 1999.  Bronx homicide detectives dug back into the case file for Minerliz in 2018.They were leaving school and Minerliz wanted to go to the library while Ortiz needed to get home. She said Minerliz commented that she was upset about something but didn't divulge more and Ortiz said she didn't press the issue.   \"I replay (that moment) over and over. I blamed myself for years because I said to myself, maybe if I asked I would have known what she was doing... I was the last person who probably saw her alive other than her killer,\" Ortiz told CNN in 2018.  Ortiz said Minerliz left that afternoon and boarded a city bus wearing a red jacket and carrying her backpack. Minerliz was supposed to meet her younger sister after school, but never did.    Her mother called 911 that evening to report that her daughter never came home from school, according to a missing person's report filed with the NYPD.   A task force was formed to find the killer   Four days later, Minerliz's body was found behind a video store two miles from her home.    \"It was a Sunday morning and I was at church,\" recalls retired Det. Barney Ryan. \"I got a beep because we still had beepers then. There was a guy who dug through the dumpsters. He found a heavy bag and ripped it open.\" Officers from New York City's 45th Precinct were called to the scene. A quick comparison to missing persons records determined it was Minerliz.  According to details of the case file made available to CNN, her body was found tied up with green gaffer's tape and placed in the fetal position inside the black garbage bag.   She was fully clothed; her bookbag and the red parka she was last seen wearing, weren't with her body. The medical examiner determined there were no signs of sexual assault, but there were traces of semen found on her sweatshirt.  Minerliz's slaying in 1999 was the subject of newspaper stories at the time, including this one in the Daily News.She had been strangled, according to detectives and the indictment.  \"She was all wrapped up in a bundle like somebody cared that she was dead,\" said retired Det. Michael Lagiovane, who checked on the status of Minerliz's case each year, even after he handed in his badge in 2001. Lagiovane was part of a task force formed by the NYPD in 1999, comprised of dozens of detectives in the Bronx and from across the department. The hope was the sheer manpower would help quickly solve the case.  Authorities questioned family members, neighbors, classmates and teachers; wanted posters showing a smiling Minerliz and highlighting a hefty reward were plastered across the city.  Nevada police identify victim of 41-year-old cold case homicide using genealogy and DNA testing Ortiz said her school and classmates were \"on edge\" during the search for the killer.  \"We were all worried. They didn't know who it was, and we were like the killer's still out there and this person's probably preying on kids our age,\" recalled Ortiz.  Detectives submitted DNA samples from underneath Minerliz's fingernails, hair fibers, her clothing. Some evidence items were even sent to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, but nothing came back with a conclusive match, according to details in the case file, law enforcement officials said.   After an exhaustive investigation for nearly a year and no strong leads, the case went cold.   \"The hardest cases that we deal with as medical examiners are those involving children,\" said former New York City Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Barbara Sampson, who had only been with the agency for a few months when she handled Minerliz's case.  \"What was done with her is something that has been haunting me for the nearly 20 years since,\" Sampson told CNN in 2018.  \"When it's a homicide, like this, and where there were no really good leads as to who did it. That's the most troubling kind of case for us.\"  Nearly two decades later, a renewed focus O'Toole instructed Det. Malcolm Reiman to take another look at the case in early 2018. The department hoped fresh eyes would help bring resolution.  \"Through the years, we're always working on it even before Malcolm got to work on it, we had other detectives who were here, people retire, they give it to the next person,\" said O'Toole, who became commander of the Bronx Homicide Squad just three months after Minerliz's killing and still oversees the unit. Reiman is part of the NYPD's prestigious rank of first grade detectives. Behind his glasses, he has a determined look in his eye, he's meticulous, and he takes his cases personally. Det. Malcolm Reiman, left, with retired Det. Michael Lagiovane, combed through boxes of evidence in Minerliz's case.When CNN first caught up with him, he was rounding the corner on 31 years with the department. Reiman was enthusiastic to now tackle the Soriano case and hopefully bring closure.    In February 2018, he descended the winding staircase of the historic city building that houses the homicide unit known as \"Fort Apache.\"  On the top shelf in a basement storage closet were seven cardboard boxes: a time capsule of the thorough investigation done two decades before, and in the years following.  \"They really pulled out all the stops on this,\" Reiman commented as he coughed from the dust collected on the cardboard top. \"We've got things I've never seen in a homicide case file.\"  Nearly 45 years later, a man is charged in the killing of a WW I veteran in New York CityThe boxes were filled with negatives of the crime scene photos; Minerliz's poetry book; hundreds of detective notes and interviews with persons of interest; tenant lists from the building where she lived; the posters over the years offering rewards for information.  Reiman pinned one of the posters above his desk.  \"We want to look at her. We want to humanize her,\" he said. \"Remember who we're working for.\"  There was a lot of work to do. Reiman began by searching for old detective notes on microfiche in the department records unit at headquarters.  He sifted through her journals -- a mixture of homework assignments, poetry, love notes, and aspirations.  Reiman and his partner on the case, Det. Matt McCrosson, made calls to former NYPD members who worked the crime scene and on the ensuing search for the killer in the late 90s.   Reiman points to a map which shows where Minerliz lived and attended school and where her body was found.\"Cases like this stick to guys,\" Reiman noted.  The pair also walked the areas around where Minerliz went to middle school, the alley where the dumpster used to be, and the apartment complex where she lived -- renovated many times over since the time of the killing.    They compared old crime scene photos to what the areas looked like present day, scratching notes on their pocket notepads.  \"I think it's important to put yourself in the killer's mind. Whether you'll be able to identify him and whether we get a chance to speak to him, maybe we'll out think him because we were here,\" McCrosson said.  They reinterviewed Minerliz's family members, former classmates, residents of the apartment complex and friends.  \"We can't bring her back, but I know her family and me, we all want closure. We all want to know what happened to her,\" said Ortiz, Minerliz's classmate.  'The case is solvable'  After reviewing all the files, the detectives revisited a working theory that Minerliz was likely killed by someone she knew or was familiar to her.  \"Apparently the victim used to go around to all the apartments in her building, making door-to-door candy sales,\" Reiman said several detectives noted in 1999. \"She was knocking on people's doors and these people are getting a look at her. And perhaps someone took an unhealthy interest in her.\"  They also resubmitted pieces of evidence for DNA testing. Over time, the technology had become more advanced and the database more expansive which could lead to possible matches.  A sample taken from Minerliz's sweatshirt and the garbage bags she was found in came back with no direct matches to the local DNA database, according to Reiman.  The unit's next hope for a break in the case rested on a newly approved technology in New York state -- familial DNA testing.   A detective note from 1999 states that Joseph Martinez told police, \"He has seen the victim in the lobby getting mail and remembers her selling candy in November door to door ...\"The technique, while sometimes controversial over privacy and potential racial disparity concerns, was gaining traction for solving crimes across the United States.  One notable arrest came in 2010 of the serial killer nicknamed the \"Grim Sleeper,\" who killed several women in Los Angeles beginning in the mid-80s.  Despite New York policymakers giving law enforcement a green light to use the tool, detectives would still need to convince top-level officials in the police department and district attorney's office before submitting an application to the state for familial DNA processing.  \"In order to use familial DNA, it's not something that we could just easily use every case,\" Bronx District Attorney Darcel Clark said at the news conference. \"There's a lot of restrictions. And it's very protected, and rightfully so because of the rights of individuals that may be involved.\" Las Vegas police use DNA testing and genealogical research to solve 42-year-old homicide of teen girlThe application goes to the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services and the State Police Crime lab which ensure the application meets the state's strict requirements to apply it to a case.  The process takes time and doesn't always generate a lead in the case.   Since 2017, the state has approved 35 applications for familial DNA testing. Out of the 25 cases tested so far, only 10 have netted matches, according to the latest numbers.  Reiman, under the guidance of O'Toole, made the proper requests with department superiors in the hopes it could be a breakthrough in the case, but he was at a point in his career where he didn't have years to spare. He was ready to retire.  \"I think this is the greatest job in the world,\" said Reiman on October 30, 2018, the day of his celebratory walk-out where a bagpipe played outside Bronx detective headquarters and members of the NYPD, including top brass, saluted the veteran detective.   \"It's very difficult to leave that case unfinished and numerous other cases as well,\" said Reiman, whose partner McCrosson has also since retired. \"The case is solvable.\"   Finally, a breakthrough  When the forensics division heard from the state about the familial DNA test result, it was the breakthrough investigators had been waiting for.In June 2020, state officials called the NYPD forensics division with a name linked to the familial DNA test, according to Chief Katranakis.  \"I felt like I could levitate,\" Katranakis said about receiving the call. \"The number of months, the hundreds and thousands of hours that were put into getting us where we were, that was the moment that made the difference, like the case is going to be solved.\"  But, getting a name was just the beginning of the work he would have to do.  He assembled a team of investigators who created a family tree based off the familial DNA result -- Martinez's father. Katranakis said they then narrowed it down to five relatives of his as people who could be connected to Minerliz's case.  Next, detectives worked to determine who of those men could have possibly committed the crime by working through a \"plot process of exclusion.\"  \"We look at the location of where they resided. We look to see if they were in the United States at the time the crime was committed. We look at their physical capabilities,\" said Katranakis.  In Minerliz's journals, she listed astronomy websites she liked to visit. The team ultimately narrowed down their search to three people -- one of them being Martinez,  Katranakis said.  When they took another look at the evidence, detectives said they spotted Martinez's name in the 1999 tenant listing of the building where Minerliz lived with her family.  Katranakis said they lawfully collected the abandonment DNA sample from Martinez and compared it to the semen left on Minerliz's sweatshirt and that comparison came back as a direct match to Martinez. O'Toole said even more evidence led detectives to believe Minerliz may have known Martinez. In Minerliz's journals, there is a long list of astronomy websites she liked to visit, and O'Toole said she told her friends she wanted to be an astronaut.  \"The stars and everything she was interested in is something that our suspect is interested in and he's on the internet going around talking about it,\" O'Toole said. Reiman said Martinez was on a short list of former tenants he wanted to speak to when he was working on the case, particularly after detectives had interviewed Martinez during a routine canvas of the apartment building in March 1999.  Old case notes showed Martinez had seen Minerliz \"in the lobby getting mail and remembers her selling candy....\" Reiman, left, and Lagiovane look on as Det. Dominic Robinson and Sgt. Tom McLaughlin (back right) escort Martinez.Monday's indictment was reassurance for Reiman that he was \"going in the right direction.\" The court document spells out the two murder charges against Martinez, also known as \"Jupiter Joe,\" alleging he caused the death of Minerliz intentionally by \"compressing her neck\" and that he committed or attempted to commit sexual abuse -- and in the course of that crime -- killed her. O'Toole said one of the most important aspects of Martinez's arrest is it shows that the technology works. He said he has three cases where he'd like to use familial DNA testing to hopefully get \"resolution\" for the victims' families.  Omar Soriano said it was the first step toward getting justice for his cousin but emphasized, \"We're not done yet.\" Reiman called the arrest \"a tremendous relief.\" \"I hope she's smiling at us. I hope that she sees all the people that cared ... and that she knew she wasn't forgotten.\" Ultimately, Minnie left a lasting legacy to loved ones in her journals, where her poems like the one entitled \"Rainbow\" are a poignant reminder of a bright future never fulfilled.

        "content": "(CNN)The office of the New York Attorney General Letitia James on Wednesday released a transcript of its investigators' interview with former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, along with other documents and exhibits, from its investigation into the sexual harassment allegations that ultimately led to his resignation.The documents included in the release were the basis for the August report that found Cuomo had sexually harassed 11 women. A week after James submitted her findings, Cuomo -- though denying any wrongdoing -- announced he would step down after a decade in office.Cuomo's lawyer, Rita Glavin, has repeatedly called for the transcripts and other evidence collected by the attorney general's investigators to be made public. The trove of newly released documents include many details featured in James' report, but add new insight into Cuomo's often combative demeanor as he came under questioning by the attorney general's investigators. The former governor has, before and after announcing he would resign, described the probe -- which he referred to James' office -- as politically motivated, a charge he has ramped up after James entered next year's Democratic gubernatorial primary.    In his exchanges with investigators, Cuomo repeatedly rejected allegations against him or said, in more specific cases, that he did not remember potentially damaging claims. He argued in at least one case about the framing of a question, leading to a tense exchange over the definition of \"girlfriend.\" In all, the transcript of his 11-hour testimony from earlier this year goes on for 515 pages.After being sworn in by Joon Kim, one of the independent investigators hired by James to conduct the probe, Cuomo was asked if he understood his rights -- specifically, that he was not required to respond to questions if he believed they might be incriminating in a future criminal case. (The attorney general's investigation was a civil matter.)Read More\"I'm a former attorney general. I'm aware of the attorney general's power,\" Cuomo replied. \"I'm aware of the special prosecutor power, independent investigator power, and I understand there may be subsequent investigations to this investigation, yes.\"Later on, Cuomo was asked whether he had compared the appearance of one of his accusers, Lindsey Boylan, to that of an ex-girlfriend. Cuomo recalled stating that Boylan looked like a \"clone\" of another woman he knew, but -- in his denial -- began a lengthy and, at times, absurd back-and-forth over the definition of \"girlfriend.\"  One of the investigators who carried out the questioning, Anne Clark, pressed Cuomo on whether the woman he said looked like Boylan, Lisa Shields, was ever his girlfriend.\"Was she my girlfriend,\" Cuomo said, \"meaning?\"When Clark asked Cuomo if he understood \"what a girlfriend is,\" the former governor replied, \"Well, girlfriend means different things to difference people.\"Pressed twice on what it meant to him, Cuomo demurred again.\"It doesn't matter what it means to me,\" he said. \"It matters what you want to know.\"When Boylan began tweeting about a \"toxic work environment\" in December 2020, Cuomo said he and his team consulted with \"everyone and their mother,\" including staffers, advisors, attorneys and advocacy groups. \"Because you need to say something. This is not an option, go say nothing. But obviously a high level of sensitivity has to be taken in what you say so that you don't -- you're not perceived as attacking her for saying it,\" Cuomo said.Cuomo also invoked President Joe Biden during the discussion about his team's response to Boylan's claims. During the 2020 campaign, Biden had been accused of sexual misconduct by a former staffer in his Senate office. Biden repeatedly denied the allegation and, unlike Cuomo, was not the subject of multiple credible accusations. Asked if it was his idea to try to attempt to \"get women to sign on\" to a statement of support, Cuomo did not directly answer but again pointed to Biden's defense as a guide.\"I thought it was more effective than just me going out there saying, 'No, none of this happened.' I thought it was more effective to have female staff people say -- make a statement,\" Cuomo said. \"That's what Biden did. That's what other politicians have done in this circumstance. I thought that was an effective vehicle.\"Biden called for Cuomo to resign after James put out her report.In his interview, Cuomo also expressed contempt for Kim, a former federal prosecutor who during his time as the acting US attorney supervised several public corruption cases that put some of the most senior officials in Albany behind bars. Though Kim's colleagues have frequently attested to his professionalism, Cuomo questioned Kim's selection to help run the investigation. \"I mean, the concept of you as the resolution to the conflict as an independent reviewer is bizarre to me and raises ethical and legal questions,\" Cuomo said. \"The way you, then, have conducted the review itself I believe raises ethical and legal questions.\"Cuomo also took a shot at Preet Bharara, the former US attorney in Manhattan and a close friend of Kim, and made a curious reference to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York.\"Preet Bharara has political aspirations, may have political aspirations against me,\" Cuomo said. \"His rabbi, your rabbi, Senator Schumer called for my resignation.\" CNN has reached out to Schumer's office for comment.The former governor ended his marathon testimony with one last jab at Kim.\"I would like to say it was a pleasure, Mr. Kim,\" Cuomo deadpanned. \"But I'm under oath.\"On Wednesday evening, Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi responded to the release of the transcripts by again claiming that James was pursuing a political vendetta against the former governor and accusing her of overseeing a \"slanted process.\" Glavin, Cuomo's attorney, later also questioned James' motives, criticizing the attorney general in a statement for what she called a \"slow-rolling and selective disclosure.\" Cuomo, for his part, has tweeted a barrage of criticism and attacks on James and her investigation following release of the documents.No legitimate law enforcement officer acts like this in a pending case,\" Glavin said of James. \"Disturbingly, this has never been about fairness or due process.\"James' office, in an earlier statement accompanying the release, said that \"multiple district attorneys\" had previously requested the attorney general \"refrain from publicly releasing transcripts and other evidence so that their offices could first investigate and determine whether to file criminal charges against Cuomo.\"But that changed, the attorney general's office said, following the filing of a criminal complaint against Cuomo on October 28 by the Albany County sheriff. The fate of that case, in which Cuomo has been charged with forcible touching, is currently in flux after the district attorney described the complaint as \"potentially defective\" and asked the court in Albany to delay the process by 60 days while prosecutors continue their investigation.The case in Albany County centers on allegations former executive assistant Brittany Commisso, who has accused Cuomo of groping her when they were alone in one of his offices inside the executive mansion. In her testimony for the James report, Commisso made previously unreported claims that she believes Cuomo's team had considered weaponizing her ongoing divorce in an effort to undermine her accusations against the governor. \"I definitely feel like in the beginning I was hearing rumors that he was saying we were having an affair and that was going to be his defense,\" Commisso told investigators. \"Obviously that is not true and I feel as though that (Cuomo counsel) Beth Garvey was asking about my relationship status to see if that was a route they could take to try to meddle in my divorce to try to get to, quote unquote, do his dirty work.\"CNN has reached out to Cuomo's attorney for comment on Commisso's allegation.Last week, the district attorney questioned the validity of the criminal complaint filed by the sheriff's office because it attached only a short excerpt of the transcript of Commisso's testimony for the James report.  He said the excerpt failed to include pieces of testimony from Commisso that could potentially be viewed as \"exculpatory\" in court, though he did not offer details about the extent or value of what had been left out.  \"As these materials are now being released by the Albany County District Attorney's office -- and in an effort to provide full transparency to the people of New York -- the OAG has informed local district attorneys that it will immediately begin releasing, on a rolling basis, all transcripts and corresponding exhibits compiled during the investigation, pending redactions to protect the privacy of individuals, as appropriate,\" James's office said.This story has been updated with additional details Wednesday.",

        "content": "(CNN)With New York City's vaccine mandate for employees set to go into effect this week, officials at the fire and police departments are scrambling to deal with potential staff shortages.As of Wednesday, about 65% of city firefighters and 75% of police officers had received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, officials said.Unions for the two departments have come out against the mandate, which requires city workers to be vaccinated against the novel coronavirus by Friday evening.City education staff and healthcare workers have been required to be vaccinated for several weeks but other employees had been able to eschew vaccines in favor of frequent coronavirus testing.As of Wednesday, the Fire Department of New York was preparing for a 20% reduction in service Monday, a source familiar with the ongoing situation told CNN. Read MoreSeparately, Commissioner Dermot Shea said the New York Police Department is also making plans for shortages.  Why are cops fighting vaccine mandates?The mandate will take effect Friday at 5 p.m. ET after a judge on Staten Island on Wednesday denied a request by the city's largest police union to block the city's requirements.Patrick Lynch, head of the New York City Police Benevolent Association and a named party to the suit, said in a statement that the decision was a \"violation of police officers' rights,\" and said it would lead to fewer officers on the city's streets.\"City Hall has given no reason that a vaccine mandate with a weekly testing option is no longer enough to protect police officers and the public,\" Lynch said, \"especially while the number of Covid-19 cases continues to fall.\"Mayor Bill de Blasio said he wants the employees to get vaccinated by Friday. \"If they don't, they're going off payroll,\" he said.\"Every one of the commissioners has been absolutely confident that they can make the adjustments and every one of the commissioners has adamantly wanted us to move forward with a vaccine mandate. So, I feel ready,\" he said.FDNY may cancel vacationsAs many as one-fifth of the city's fire companies could be closed as a result of unvaccinated staff, the source told CNN, adding that one-fifth of the department's ambulances may go out of service for the same reason.The FDNY is planning to cancel vacations and enact mandatory overtime to try to mitigate the expected staffing problems, according to the source, and leadership will be holding virtual meetings with staff throughout the week imploring them to get vaccinated. The city's emergency medical services will also seek support by enacting mutual aid with private hospitals and volunteer ambulance services, according to the source.In a statement shared with CNN, Fire Commissioner Daniel A. Nigro said the department will continue to provide necessary services to the city.New York City vaccine mandate extends to all city workers and includes a new $500 bonus, mayor says\"The Department must manage the unfortunate fact that a portion of our workforce has refused to comply with a vaccine mandate for all city employees,\" he said. \"We will use all means at our disposal, including mandatory overtime, mutual aid from other EMS providers, and significant changes to the schedules of our members. We will ensure the continuity of operations and safety of all those we have sworn oaths to serve.\"Nigro told reporters Wednesday he believes that FDNY members will get vaccinated. \"We certainly expect pushback. The unions have stated there would be some pushback. I think our members have taken an oath of office to serve the public. They've bravely done that for 156 years, they've done it through the pandemic, and I think they'll step up and do it now,\" Nigro said. Two unions that represent firefighters said they will hold a protest Thursday outside Gracie Mansion, the mayor's home.Firefighters were told October 20 that they would need to make a decision about the vaccine by this Friday and the unions blasted the city for that timing.\"It's unconscionable that they're going to treat these people like that,\" Uniformed Fire Officers Association President Jim McCarthy said. \"Nine days to make a decision on what's going to affect the rest of their life with their spouse and their family not being able to weigh in.\"McCarthy also said those who may choose to retire from the department haven't been given enough time to make that decision.\"That is not enough time to make a retirement decision, if you're going to retire from this job,\" McCarthy said. \"We've had many of our members that have compensatory time that they're not going to be able to take off because they have to make a decision. They can't consult with their spouses, they can't consult with their families.\"Andrew Ansbro, president of the Uniformed Firefighters Association, said firefighters who don't get vaccinated will be placed on leave for 30 days but won't have their medical benefits or union benefits taken away at that time.He also highlighted again the dedication firefighters have shown during the pandemic.\"For the last 20 months no one can deny that New York City firefighters and New York City first responders and the essential workers have been front and center in this pandemic,\" Ansbro said.  \"Three ways have we've been through it and now we're given a nine day deadline decision on whether or not we're going to accept the vaccine. We are not anti-vaccine, we are anti-mandate.\"As for the police, Commissioner Shea told New York City TV station WPIX that he planned to tape a final video PSA later on Wednesday encouraging officers to get vaccinated.The commissioner said that the department was working on contingency plans, which include asking vaccinated NYPD officers to work overtime or double shifts.There are no plans to bring in additional officers from outside of New York City to deal with potential shortages, he said, adding, \"New Yorkers will be safe.\" CNN's Evan Simko-Bednarski, Lauren del Valle, Taylor Romine, Rob Frehse and Kelly Christ contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Evia, Greece (CNN)At times it feels like the air itself is burning here on Evia.  The smell and taste of smoke is ever-present; ash falls from the sky like sinister confetti.At the edge of the forests, being devoured by flames as tall as the trees themselves, exhausted firefighters mingle with desperate villagers. United in their struggle against this relentless, ravenous enemy, they fight to defend their land, their homes, and their livelihoods. For many, the battle has already been lost.Local youths and volunteers have been supporting firefighters in their efforts to battle the fires.As the forests continue to burn, anger is simmering too.  Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis' contrite admission that Greece's response to these blazes had \"weaknesses\" has done little to douse the fury of those who have watched their homes burn. It has simply come too late. \"Now the game is lost, now that everyone is coming, what is there to save?\" asks one young man. Eight days of flames ripping through these virgin forests have left behind nothing but blackened branches and ashen ground.  Twenty-two countries have sent personnel and equipment to help Greece.  On Evia, the front line of this growing disaster, we found Slovakian firefighters standing shoulder to shoulder with their Greek counterparts, while helicopters and planes buzzed overhead dropping water on the smoldering ground.Thousands have been forced to flee by sea from the island, which lies around 100 miles north of Athens.Among these professionals was perhaps the most confronting sight of this story: volunteers, mostly young men, armed with fire extinguishers or whatever water they could carry.  Blackened with soot, their breath rasping from days of exposure to smoke and flames, they looked forlorn.Read MoreThe fighting goes back and forth.  There are moments when the firefighters seem to have repelled their foe, the flames dying down into the soaking earth, but these apparent victories can be fleeting.  A single blazing pine kernel, rolling across a road, can spark a fresh fire on the other side.  Often fires just reignite in the fierce, exhausting heat of the day.  The hilly terrain and thick forest mean that many blazes are simply inaccessible, so are left to rage along their paths unhindered.Evia is on the front line of the devastating wildfires raging across Greece.To stand amidst all of this is disorienting.  The searing heat, the choking smoke, the sheer ferocity of the fires and the intense activity all around is hard to process at times. The sight of so many people watching their lives literally going up in smoke is heartbreaking.\"Right now, everyone is here, you are all here getting these dramatic pictures,\" one of the volunteers said to me.  \"But in a year's time where will you be?\"  Many residents make their livings from tree resin used in industrial and agricultural products.Without the forests, many in these communities will have nothing, he explained to me.Greece faces 'disaster of unprecedented proportions' as wildfires ravage the countryThe trees are the source of the resin that sustains many livelihoods here. But these forests are not plantations; the trees have grown naturally on these hills, and communities have grown around them.  Simply replanting will not work either, because only mature trees produce resin, and reaching that maturity can take three decades.Over 500 fires still rage across Greece.  They may continue to burn for many more days, perhaps even weeks -- but their deep, scarring impact will be felt long into the future.",

        "content": "This story originally ran on January 18, 2017. (CNN)Sometimes presidential inaugurations are full of pomp and circumstance. Sometimes they end with the newly sworn-in president jumping out of a White House window. Intrigued yet?Whether you're stoked or bummed about the way the election turned out, here are some fun facts to make you look like a history buff to your friends as the inauguration festivities near. Yes, (most of) this stuff really happened.     When William Henry Harrison was too proud to wear a coat. What, you don't remember who William Henry Harrison is? Probably because while he holds the record for giving the longest inaugural address, he didn't hang around the White House too long. His 8,500-word address took about an hour and 45 minutes to read. But it was a super cold and rainy day in 1841, and Harrison refused to wear a hat or coat. He caught a cold that developed into pneumonia and died a month later. Read MoreThat's what his official cause of death was, but that's been called into question, with contaminated water being a possible culprit. Harrison became the first president to die in office and served the shortest tenure in US history.William Henry Harrison apparently didn't even use an umbrella.Abraham Lincoln's soon-to-be assassin took part in the festivities. It was Lincoln's second inauguration in 1865, the first time African-Americans participated in the inaugural parade. Concerns about Lincoln's safety lingered. His inauguration four years earlier was the first to incorporate major security measures. There was a guest in the crowd that day in 1865 who would become Lincoln's biggest threat. John Wilkes Booth, the man who would shoot Lincoln a month later, can be seen in photos near the President as he delivers his address. Assassin John Wilkes Booth got close to President Lincoln more than once.Teddy Roosevelt's unique inauguration jewelry.For his second inauguration in 1905, Roosevelt wore a ring containing a lock of Abraham Lincoln's hair. Wait, what? Roosevelt was inspired by Lincoln. His admiration started early. There's an image of Roosevelt as a boy looking out of a second-story window onto Lincoln's funeral procession. Roosevelt called himself an heir to Lincoln's policies during his presidency, referring to his relationship with the African-American community.Roosevelt eventually became friendly with Secretary of State John Hay, who also happened to be Lincoln's former personal secretary. Hay gave Roosevelt the ring containing the lock of Lincoln's hair to treasure. President Theodore Roosevelt was an admirer of Lincoln.That time Andrew Jackson jumped out of a White House window. Maybe. It was 1829. One of the nastiest campaigns in US history had just ended with Andrew Jackson winning the presidency over John Quincy Adams. The White House held an open house after Jackson's inauguration inviting anyone to come hang out. Problem was, the White House wasn't prepared for the crowd. Accounts vary. Some say it was a wild party where furniture was destroyed and the mob of people had to be lured outside with punch. Others say the riotous atmosphere was fabricated into lore by Jackson's enemies. No one disputes that the number of people at the party was insane. Jackson had to get out. So did he really escape through a White House window or did his staff quietly escort him from the property? Depends on which account you believe.Andrew Jackson's inaugural party was a wild time.The 'So help me God' line was ad-libbed.The actual oath, laid out in Article II Section I of the Constitution, is just 35 words: \"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\"During his first inauguration in 1789 in New York, it is said that George Washington added the phrase, \"So help me God,\" and so the precedent was set that presidents follow to this day. There isn't any hard evidence of this, however.  Why did Washington take the oath in New York? That was the seat of the government at the time. Thomas Jefferson was the first president to be inaugurated in Washington, in 1801 after it became the capital city.President George Washington set the tone for future inaugural oaths.Inauguration festivities weren't always so chilly to attend. Washington winters aren't exactly ideal for outdoor gatherings, so why hold inaugurations in January?James Buchanan didn't have to worry about a chance of snow when he was inaugurated in 1857. It was a beautiful spring day, which helped make the first known photograph of a presidential inauguration that much more perfect. It wasn't until the 20th Amendment was ratified in 1933 that the date of January 20 was set as the end of the term of office for the president and vice president. President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama walk in the 2009 inaugural parade.Whose line is it?You've heard these famous lines, and now you'll know where they come from!~ \"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\" -- Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1933 inauguration~ \"Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.\" -- John F. Kennedy, 1961 inauguration~ \"Our long national nightmare is over.\" -- Gerald R. Ford, 1974 inauguration, referring to Watergate~ \"Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.\" -- Ronald Reagan, 1981 inaugurationQuiz time!\n\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly cited the National Archives with regard to George Washington's inaugural address.",

Three months ago, a pair of sheriff's deputies were shot while sitting in their patrol car. And just last month, a 29-year-old man was fatally shot outside his home, allegedly by members of a street gang.Los Angeles deputy who was critically injured in Compton shooting was released from hospital, sheriff saysThe three seemingly unconnected attacks in Southern California have one thing in common, according to federal authorities: So-called ghost guns recovered by police during their investigations all trace back to the same company in Nevada.On Thursday, federal agents armed with a search warrant raided the company \u2014 Polymer80 \u2014 based on suspicion that it was illegally manufacturing and distributing firearms. Read MoreThe ATF's investigation is centered on the company's \"Buy Build Shoot\" kit which consumers can purchase online, then assemble at home to create a fully functioning weapon, according to a 119-page search warrant affidavit unsealed Thursday in Nevada. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\n\n\n\nGuns produced from such kits are known as \"ghost guns\" because they do not contain serial numbers and are considered untraceable. Such guns have drawn the ire of law enforcement officials in recent years as they have been recovered at crime scenes and in police investigations with increasing frequency. David Borges, the CEO and co-founder of Polymer80, said it was \"a big surprise\" when agents raided the company's facility in Dayton, Nevada, Thursday morning. He declined further comment in a brief telephone interview with CNN, noting that agents remained on the property carrying out their search.Jason Davis, an attorney for Polymer80, said in an emailed statement that the company has a history of cooperating with the ATF and \"will continue to do so.\" The statement added, in part, that \"the company takes its legal obligations seriously\" and is also committed to \"vigorously protecting its rights under the law.\"No arrests have been made in connection with the search.The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives recently determined that Polymer80's kits meet the definition of a firearm under the law, even if they are not yet assembled. Based on that determination, the kits are subject to federal gun laws, such as background checks on buyers, which \"it appears that Polymer80 does not conduct,\" the affidavit states. In addition, the document states, \"it appears that Polymer80 shipped items to individuals determined to be felons and otherwise prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms.\"ATF officials, based on data from the agency's National Tracing Center, estimate that approximately 10,000 ghost guns were recovered in the US last year, including about 2,700 in California. Polymer80 guns were used in \"hundreds of crimes throughout the United States,\" and about 15 of the company's weapons were recovered during homicide investigations in California, the document states.Polymer80, which derives its name from the polymer plastic its products are made from, sells various firearms, firearm parts and accessories on its website. President Trump calls injured Compton deputies, one of whom can't speak and wrote out her responsesThe \"Buy Build Shoot,\" kit is advertised as containing all the necessary parts to build a complete firearm, as well as a 10-round magazine and pistol case, according to the affidavit.The ATF purchased multiple kits from the company's website, and an agent used one to build a functioning firearm in about three hours, according to the affidavit. A confidential informant working with the agency \u2014 a convicted felon with past experience with guns \u2014 was able to so in 21 minutes, the document states.Following that scenario, a senior ATF agent determined that the kits fit the definition of a firearm which is described, in part, as a weapon \"which will or is designed or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive.\" JUST WATCHEDNew Jersey cracks down on 'ghost gun' assault riflesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNew Jersey cracks down on 'ghost gun' assault rifles 02:09Thursday's raid was not the first sign of trouble for Polymer80.

        "content": "(CNN)In a stunning reprieve for a man sentenced to more than five centuries behind bars for a nonviolent offense, a judge in Los Angeles on Thursday summarily slashed his sentence to time served and ordered his immediate release. Juan Carlos Seresi, a convicted money launderer whose projected release date from the federal Bureau of Prisons had been July 8, 2419, was suddenly ordered to be freed \"without delay\" by U.S. District Court Judge Stephen V. Wilson. Once out, Seresi will be subject to a three-year term of supervised release, according to Wilson's order. \"It's a miracle,\" Seresi said after hearing the news from his daughter, Patti Mawer, she told CNN. Mawer, 46, said her father has been behind bars since she was a teenager, but has remained an integral part of her family's life. \"After all this praying and all this hoping, he can't believe it,\" Mawer added. Seresi, 73, was one of four defendants sentenced to 505 years behind bars in 1991 for laundering cocaine cartel cash who were featured in a CNN report published in August. The article noted how the sentences were considered harsh even back then and represent the sort of draconian punishment that has since been widely condemned amid a national conversation around justice reform. Read MoreThese men received 505-year prison sentences each. Now their cases are under new scrutinyWhen the case was before Wilson in August, he denied a request by prosecutors to overturn the men's convictions \"in the interests of justice\" due to special treatment given to a government witness by FBI agents that was not disclosed to the defense. Wilson conducted a months-long review into the matter and concluded that the men's convictions were sufficiently supported by evidence and testimony unrelated to that particular witness. All four defendants filed an appeal with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which is pending. But Seresi's attorneys also filed a motion seeking his release on compassionate grounds, due in part to his advanced age and a diagnosis of high blood pressure making him susceptible to serious complications from Covid-19. Prosecutors in the US Attorney's Office in Los Angeles did not oppose the motion. While Wilson found that those factors alone did not entitle Seresi to early release, he noted other factors that \u2014 taken together \u2014 amounted to \"extraordinary and compelling reasons\" for granting his freedom. Seresi was convicted of a nonviolent offense, had already served more than 30 years behind bars, earned three associate degrees while incarcerated and had a near spotless disciplinary record, the judge noted. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\n\n\n\n\"The Court's findings should not be construed to minimize the severity of the Defendant's conduct,\" Wilson wrote, noting that Seresi was \"a key employee of the ringleaders of a substantial money laundering conspiracy.\" Wilson wrote that he was ordering the release under a \"catch all\" provision of federal law that, in his view, allowed him to consider a wide variety of factors concerning Seresi's continued imprisonment. \"Very few cases will fall within that provision,\" Wilson wrote. \"Most will not.\" \"We are so happy for Juan Carlos and his beautiful family,\" said Reuven Cohen, one of Seresi's lawyers, whose firm took the case on a pro bono basis.Seresi, along with brothers Vahe and Nazareth Andonian and Raul Vivas, were convicted of helping to launder more than $300 million in drug cartel money through their precious metal and money exchange companies. Seresi, considered the least culpable of the defendants by the sentencing judge, worked as an employee of Vivas. Arizona county dismisses marijuana charges after state vote to legalize itNone of the men was convicted of direct involvement in the massive cocaine distribution ring at the center of the case. Following their sentences, the men languished in prison for decades as one appeal after another was denied. But last year they got what seemed like an extraordinary break when federal prosecutors sided with the defense in seeking to have their convictions overturned based on special treatment given to a key government witness by the name of Sergio Hochman. Hochman, a co-conspirator in the drug and money laundering case who cut an early deal with the government, disclosed decades later that agents treated him to a handcuff-free seaside lunch in Malibu and allowed him visits with his wife in the backseat of a car and in her apartment in Tucson, AZ. The benefits were not disclosed to the defense. Prosecutors confirmed the information with Seresi's FBI handlers and ultimately concluded the information was sufficiently damaging to warrant throwing out the case. Wilson, however, launched his own inquiry, which included a review of thousands of pages of documents from the trial. He issued a 32-page ruling in August denying the prosecution's request to overturn the convictions. Wilson said he found that Hochman's testimony had been \"helpful\" to the government, but \"not critical.\" \"It's not enough that the government's case would be slightly weaker without Hochman,\" he wrote. Attorney Jerry Newton, who represents Vahe Andonian, praised Wilson's decision to grant Seresi early release and said he believed the Andonian brothers were similarly strong candidates for such mercy. He said he intends to file a similar motion in front of Wilson while their appeal is pending in the 9th Circuit. \"They're essentially around the same age. They've spent 31 years in prison without one incident. They've taken every educational course they could get their hands on,\" Newton said. \"It's a fair and just result to let them enjoy the remainder of their lives outside of prison.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)For years, Marcus Braziel took his customers at their word when they showed up with wads of cash to buy one of the customized AR-15-style rifles he advertised for sale on the internet.If they said there was no legal reason to prevent them from owning a gun, Braziel said, that was good enough for him. He saw no need for obtaining a license and conducting formal criminal background checks.But that was before federal agents showed up at his door in Lubbock, Texas, and told him they'd traced one of his weapons to a mass shooter.\"I wanted to vomit,\" Braziel recalled in an exclusive interview with CNN. \"My life has not been the same since. I will be forever sorry.\"Braziel, 45, pleaded guilty Wednesday in US District Court in Lubbock to felony charges of dealing and manufacturing firearms without a license and filing a false tax return that failed to report income from his gun sales. He faces up to five years in federal prison under a plea deal with prosecutors.Read MoreMarcus Braziel illegally sold an AR-15-style weapon used in a mass shooting.Among the firearms he illegally sold was an AR-15-style weapon that Seth Ator used to kill seven people and wound 25 others in a shooting spree in the Midland-Odessa area of Texas last year.Braziel said his brief encounter with Ator and its horrific and lingering consequences have made him a fervent believer in universal background checks on would-be gun buyers.\"I feel responsible for the role I played in selling him a firearm,\" he told CNN. \"My primary objective is that this never happen to anyone else.\"Erin Nealy Cox, the US Attorney for the Northern District of Texas, said the case against Braziel underscores that dealing firearms without a license \"isn't some obscure, meaningless, technical violation.\" \"It is unlawful conduct that has real world impact and the potential for devastating results,\" she said in a prepared statement. \"The Justice Department is committed to enforcing our nation's long-held gun laws, designed to prevent firearms from falling into the wrong hands.\" 'No reason not to believe him'Seth Ator killed seven people in shooting spree.A 2019 CNN investigation found that unlicensed gun dealers like Braziel provided a steady flow of weapons to people who are either barred from owning guns or want guns that can't be traced back to them. Such weapons have often turned up in the hands of convicted felons, at crime scenes, and in police investigations, including cases of armed robbery and murder.At the heart of the problem is a vaguely worded federal statute that has frustrated efforts by law enforcement to combat the problem of illegal gun dealing, and effectively helps sustain a marketplace for black market gun sales. The law is fuzzy on the distinction between a casual seller of firearms who is not required to conduct background checks on prospective buyers and a licensed gun dealer, who is.Braziel told CNN that he saw himself as a firearms hobbyist in 2016 when Ator showed up at his home with $750 to buy the rifle he would later use in the attack. He said he had no inkling that Ator was prohibited from possessing a weapon due to a past involuntary stay in a mental institution. \"There was nothing about him that made me believe he was unstable,\" Braziel said. \"He was very calm, collected. He looked completely ordinary to me.\"Marcu Braziel required Seth Ator to fill out a bill of sale, but did not conduct a background check.He said that Ator either did not yet have \u2014 or that he did not notice \u2014 a tear drop tattoo on his left cheek that is visible in an undated photo released by authorities after the attack. A plaintiff's attorney who earlier this year filed a civil lawsuit against Braziel on behalf of some of the victims' families told reporters the markings should have been a red flag prompting closer scrutiny.As with all of his customers, Braziel said, he had Ator sign a bill of sale that contains language stating that the buyer is not banned from owning a weapon. Ator used his middle name as his last and listed a P.O. box for an address. \"I had no reason to not believe him,\" Braziel recalled.Because he was not a licensed dealer, Braziel said, he had no means \u2014 and in his mind at the time, no responsibility \u2014 to conduct a background check, and did not do so.  A visit from the ATFIt would be three years before the sale came back to haunt him in the aftermath of last year's attack.The incident began when Ator, 36, opened fire on Texas troopers who pulled him over for failing to signal. Unlicensed dealers provide a flow of weapons to those who shouldn't have them, CNN investigation findsHe then led police on a chase, firing shots at random people and at one point carjacking a US postal truck. Those fatally shot were between 15 and 57 years old, authorities said. Among the wounded were a 17-month-old girl and three law enforcement officers. Ator was killed in a shootout with police in a movie theater parking lot.Shortly after the attack, agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives arrived at Braziel's home, asking questions about guns he'd sold.He said they'd been there about 15 minutes when they revealed that one of the guns had been used by Ator.He said both he and his wife were devastated when they heard that, and that the victims and their families have remained in their thoughts ever since.\"I cannot begin to understand how they feel,\" Braziel said, his voice filled with emotion.'Engaged in the business'In the year since, agents and prosecutors have been slowly building a case against Braziel, who works as a respiratory therapist, for being an unlicensed gun dealer.The federal statute governing gun dealers says anyone \"engaged in the business\" of selling firearms requires a license. \"Engaged in the business\" means devoting \"time, attention and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms.\"He sold illegal AR-15s. Feds agreed to let him go free to avoid hurting gun control effortsThe law states that it does not apply to someone engaged in only occasional gun sales or collectors or hobbyists adding to, or selling from, their personal collection.To the frustration of gun and gun control advocates alike, the law places no set number of transactions that differentiates between a person engaged in the business and one who makes \"occasional sales.\" In court documents filed Wednesday, Braziel admitted to dealing and manufacturing firearms without a license from 2014 to 2018. He advertised gun sales on the internet and conducted transactions \u2014 almost always for cash \u2014 in his garage or in the parking lot of a local sporting goods store, according to a plea agreement and related documents filed by Assistant US Attorney Jeffrey R. Haag.Braziel custom built many of the weapons he sold, beginning with a key gun component known as a lower receiver, which ATF considers a firearm in and of itself. Braziel would buy the lower receiver, a hollow mass of metal or plastic surrounding the trigger area of a gun, and attach other parts to make it a fully functioning weapon. He would also employ a technique called \"hydro-dipping\" to give the body of a weapon a unique artistic appearance.Braziel used a process known as \"hydro-dipping\" to make distinctive designs on firearms.Braziel told ATF agents that he and a family member would \"buy them, build them, play with them, and then sell them when they were finished,\" court records state. Though Braziel said he considered this a hobby at the time, agents later discovered items about gunsmithing and starting a business on his laptop computer in January 2015.According to prosecutors, Braziel sold firearms to three other people barred from possessing weapons, in addition to Ator. Braziel also failed to declare $3,800 from the sale of firearms on his 2016 tax return, according to court filings. Agents seized 29 firearms from Braziel's house when they executed a search warrant in the days after the shooting.Texas shooting highlights dangers of guns sold without background checksHis lawyer, Daniel W. Hurley, said Braziel read an ATF pamphlet called \"Do I Need A License to Buy and Sell Firearms?\" several years ago and concluded at the time that he did not. He has since acknowledged having willfully violated the law, Hurley said.But the lawyer said agreeing to plead guilty was not an easy decision.Hurley said he presented the case to a mock jury earlier this year and that \"a clear majority thought Marcus was not guilty.\"  Braziel was motivated to take the plea nonetheless, Hurley said, because of the threat of a lengthy prison sentence if he lost at trial and because he wanted to speak out about the dangers of dealing guns without a license.\"It's too risky. People can die because of it,\" Hurley said. \"Marcus wants the whole world to know that.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Police Officer Rusten Sheskey has told investigators that it wasn't just his life he was defending when he fired his weapon seven times at Jacob Blake last month in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He said he used deadly force during the chaotic encounter because he was afraid Blake, while attempting to flee the scene, was trying to kidnap a child in the backseat of the vehicle. \"He's got my kid. He's got my keys,\" Sheskey heard a woman say, according to attorney Brendan Matthews, who is representing the officer. If Sheskey had allowed Blake to drive away and something happened to the child \"the question would have been 'why didn't you do something?'\" Matthews said. That explanation, provided in an exclusive interview with CNN, offers the most detailed rationale to date for Sheskey's highly scrutinized decision to shoot Blake, who is Black, as he leaned into an SUV with his children inside it on August 23. Cellphone video of the shooting went viral on the internet, sparking days of protests and rioting in the lakeside city of Kenosha. The shooting, which Blake's family has said resulted in paralysis from his waist down, was widely condemned as yet another unjustified shooting of a Black person by police. Former Madison police chief to consult on Jacob Blake shootingThe attorney's comments to CNN come as authorities in Wisconsin announced this week that the results of an investigation by the state Department of Justice would soon be turned over to a retired police chief serving as an independent consultant for his review. The consultant is in turn expected to forward the case to local prosecutors along with an analysis intended to help determine whether criminal charges against Sheskey are warranted. The officer remains on paid administrative leave.Matthews told CNN he typically does not talk about pending cases but said he felt compelled to provide some additional detail to counter what he described as an \"incomplete, inaccurate\" narrative that has emerged to date. Matthews directly disputed assertions by Blake's family and lawyers that he was unarmed and posed no threat to the officers.Read MoreAt the time Sheskey opened fire, the lawyer said, Blake held a knife in his hand and twisted his body toward the officer. That action is not visible in the video widely circulating on the internet, in which the view of Blake's body is partially obscured by the driver's side door of the SUV. Matthews said a second officer at the scene, whom he also represents, provided investigators with a similar account of Blake turning toward Sheskey with a knife in his hand immediately prior to the shooting. That officer said he too would have opened fire but did not have a clear angle, according to the lawyer. Authorities have said Blake had a knife in his possession and the weapon was found on the floorboard of the vehicle. But they have released few other details of the incident, citing the ongoing investigation. Jacob Blake, Sr., father of Jacob Blake, Jr., speaks during a news conference outside of the County Courthouse in Kenosha, Wisconsin on August 25.CNN reached out to Blake's attorney, Benjamin Crump, for comment on Matthews' assertions, but did not receive a response prior to publication. However, Blake's lawyers have insisted he never posed a threat to the officers at any time during the encounter, and his father has denied his son was armed. \"They shot my son seven times. Seven times. Like he didn't matter,\" Jacob Blake Sr., Blake's father, told reporters. \"But my son matters. He's a human being, and he matters.\"Blake was the aggressor at the scene, attorney saysBut Matthews, who represents the Kenosha Professional Police Association, said Blake was the aggressor in the encounter, based on the statements Sheskey and Officer Vincent Arenas gave to state investigators earlier this month. The officers, he said, were simply doing their jobs. Blake has not been charged with any crimes stemming from the events of the day he was shot.The shooting occurred minutes after Sheskey and fellow officers responded to a call of \"family trouble\" in a neighborhood a couple of miles northwest of downtown Kenosha. According to a dispatch log, a woman reported to police that Blake had taken her keys and would not give them back. Blake's family members later said he'd been attending a birthday party for one of his kids. A Black man shot in the back, a teenage shooting suspect, a city in flames: The week that shook Kenosha and the country Once at the scene, Sheskey watched Blake put one child in the car as he arrived but was unaware that two more children were already in the vehicle, Matthews said. Another officer heard a woman yelling that Blake had her children, he said, but did not see the kids in the car.Some of what officers say happened next was described in a press release issued by the police association last month.According to the release, Blake was non-cooperative from the outset and quickly became combative. When the officers attempted to physically take control of him, Blake \"actively resisted.\" An officer fired a Taser at him, but it did not stop him, the release states. When officers tried to take Blake into custody a second time, he forcefully fought with them and was able to momentarily place an officer in a headlock, the release said. Matthews said that officer was Sheskey.Police then Tased Blake a second time and he again appeared unfazed, according to the police association statement.At that point, Matthews said, officers noticed that Blake was holding a knife. Guns drawn, they demanded that he drop the weapon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\n\n\n\nBlake, according to the police association statement, did not drop the weapon and began making his way around the front of the vehicle toward the driver's side door. Video of the incident shows Blake holding the knife in his left hand as he rounds the front of the car, the statement says. While it appears that Blake is holding an object in his hand, it is unclear what that object is, according to a CNN review of the video.Shortly after the release of the statement, Blake's lawyer disputed the police account as \"overblown\" and characterized the officers as the aggressors.Raysean White, who shot video of the encounter, told CNN's Erin Burnett he twice heard police tell Blake to \"drop the knife,\" but that he did not see a knife in Blake's hand. White disputed other aspects of the police account, but said it was possible some things occurred before he began witnessing the incident unfold.The police version of events leading up to the shooting bore some similarity to an encounter allegedly involving Blake at the same address three months earlier.In that case, a woman who described Blake as her ex-boyfriend said he took her car and debit card without her permission and made $1,000 in fraudulent withdrawals, according to court records. She told police at the time that Blake did not have a car and that he would not tell her where he was living, the court records state.Jacob Blake attorneys deny police union allegations of fight with officers before shootingBlake was not charged with taking the car or money, but was charged with sexual assault and other offenses in connection with the incident. He was wanted in connection with those charges at the time of the shooting. Sheskey was aware that Blake was wanted, Matthews said, but did not know the details of the past incident prior to the shooting. Blake entered a not guilty plea to those charges earlier this month.Matthews said while seven shots may seem excessive to some people, that number of shots is not out of line with other police shootings in Wisconsin and elsewhere that were later deemed justified. He also pointed to studies showing a lag time between an officer's decision to stop firing and actually doing so. The lawyer said Sheskey ceased firing when he determined Blake \"no longer posed an imminent threat.\"Matthews questioned early reports that Blake was shot seven times in the back. He said Sheskey and fellow officers administered first aid at the scene and did not see any gunshot wounds to Blake's back. Rather, he said, the officers reported seeing injuries to Blake's arms, side and abdomen.The precise location of the gunshot wounds Blake sustained have not been made public. A news release from The Wisconsin Division of Criminal Investigation initially said Sheskey fired his weapon seven times \"into Mr. Blake's back.\" The agency later changed the language to say Sheskey fired \"towards Mr. Blake's back.\"Sheskey 'absolutely did not want this to happen'For Sheskey, the fallout from the highly publicized shooting has been devastating, his lawyer said.He had to move out of his house and get rid of his phone because he's been hounded by reporters and depicted as a racist and brutal cop on the internet, Matthews said.Matthews said his client has never pulled the trigger in the line of duty before now, and has no history of abusing suspects in his 10 years as a police officer, the last seven with Kenosha PD.Rather, the lawyer described his client as a lifelong do-gooder, who as a young man served as a mentor on a cycling team for at-risk youth and worked as a lifeguard. He wanted to become a cop to continue helping people.Matthews said Sheskey immediately dropped to the ground in the moments after the shooting and began rendering first aid to Blake and comforted him when he expressed fear that he was going to die.\"He didn't go to work wanting to shoot anybody. He went to work trying to help people. That's what he does every day,\" Matthews said of Sheskey. \"He absolutely did not want this to happen.\"CNN's Sara Sidner contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Before he was identified as the police officer captured in a viral video in which he shoots a Black man multiple times in the back, Rusten Sheskey pedaled around the lakeside city of Kenosha, Wisconsin, as part of the bike patrol and walked the shopping mall beat during the holidays. He'd occasionally bring a squad car home from work and turn on the siren for neighborhood kids, one neighbor recalled. An American flag flies outside his home in a middle-class neighborhood.But four days after Sheskey's shooting of 29-year-old Jacob Blake prompted protests and rioting in the typically quiet streets of Kenosha, much remains unknown about the seven-year veteran officer and what prompted him to open fire.  Authorities have declined to provide information on a number of critical questions in the turbulent days since Blake was shot. Most importantly, they have not offered any detailed explanation for why Sheskey used deadly force on Blake as he leaned into a parked car.Police and city officials also have not responded to public records requests for Sheskey's history with the department, including any previous uses of force or disciplinary issues. According to a memo from the police chief published on the city's website, Sheskey received a one-day suspension in 2017 for a violation regarding \"safe operation of department vehicles.\"Read MoreJacob Blake is handcuffed to his hospital bed, family saysMeanwhile, Blake remains handcuffed to a hospital bed. He was left paralyzed from the waist down in the aftermath of the shooting, which took place in front of three of his young children who were in the car.Dispatch records indicate that Sheskey and other officers responded to a complaint from a woman saying that Blake was not supposed to be at her residence and would not leave. She also said he had taken her keys and would not give them back.At a press conference Wednesday, Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul said officers fired a Taser at Blake before the shooting, but that it was \"not successful.\" Kaul said Blake admitted possessing a knife and officers recovered one from the floor of the car he was leaning into when Sheskey opened fire. Kaul did not say if Blake had brandished the weapon or what precise reason Sheskey gave for firing multiple shots.Blake's family has demanded answers, too, wondering why Sheskey decided to use a gun to resolve the situation. At a news conference on Tuesday, Blake's family attorney Ben Crump called for the officer's arrest.  \"We are demanding that the prosecutor arrest the officer who shot Jacob Blake. And we are also asking that these officers who violated the policies and their training be terminated immediately,\" he said. Sheskey was sworn in as a Kenosha officer in 2013, according to photos of the swearing-in ceremony posted on the department's Facebook page. He was following in the footsteps of his grandfather, who served in the department for many years, according to a post on the Kenosha Police Department's Facebook page.A search of news sites sheds little light on Sheskey. He was profiled last year by a local outlet, the Kenosha News, saying that public service was what he liked most about police work. \"You're dealing with people on perhaps the worst day of their lives and you can try and help them as much as you can and make that day a little better,\" he told the paper, according to an article published in August 2019. For the most part, Sheskey said, \"people trust us to do that for them.\"Professional athletes protest police shooting of Jacob BlakePrior to joining the Kenosha Police Department, Sheskey was employed at the University of Wisconsin-Parkside, where he worked his way up from dispatcher to police officer.A university spokeswoman declined to provide details about Sheskey's tenure other than to say he worked there from 2009 to 2013 as a dispatcher, police service associate and, finally, officer.Attempts to reach Sheskey and his family were unsuccessful. Several officers either declined comment or did not respond to inquiries from CNN.One officer said Sheskey has been unfairly dubbed a racist on the internet. The officer said there's a sense of futility when it comes to defending Sheskey. \"For somebody that knows him to come out and say he's a really solid cop and really good dude, it's gonna fall of deaf ears because he shot a Black guy,\" said the officer, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak about the incident, which remains under investigation. \"I don't think there's anything that I'm gonna tell you that's gonna make a difference because people believe what they want to believe.\"In Sheskey's neighborhood, people were reluctant to talk and most declined to provide their names when they did.One woman called Sheskey an \"outstanding citizen,\" adding, \"I think the young man went to work one day and was put in a bad situation.\"She declined to elaborate before quickly shutting her door.Cathy Broadway, an educational sign language interpreter who's lived on Sheskey's block for about 20 years, said she didn't know the officer or his family and had no idea he lived on their street until a few days ago.\"I know a lot of people packed up and they left,\" Broadway said. \"Our neighborhood could be a target.\" She said she stayed up late Wednesday night listening to a police scanner and sent her son to stay with family during the unrest. Broadway, 46, who called the video of Blake's shooting \"horrific,\" said she never imagined her city would find itself in the national spotlight.\"People call it Keno-where,\" she said. \"Now we can't call it that because everyone knows where it is.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)On an August afternoon in 1991, a federal judge in California sent an unmistakable message in the \"war on drugs\" when he sentenced four men convicted of laundering cocaine cartel cash to more than 500 years each in prison.None of the men had previous criminal records. Nor were they convicted of direct involvement in the massive cocaine distribution ring at the center of the case. The sentences by US District Court Judge William D. Keller were considered harsh even back then and represent the sort of draconian punishment that has since been widely condemned amid a national conversation around justice reform.For decades, the men sentenced by Keller that afternoon seemed destined to die in prison, just as the judge predicted they would.Then last year, they got what appeared to be an extraordinary reprieve:Read MoreFederal prosecutors, who had been investigating defense claims of undisclosed special treatment given to a key government witness by FBI agents, recommended that the men's convictions be overturned \"in the interests of justice\" and that they be released from prison right away.All that stood between the four men and their freedom was the blessing of another federal judge. That seemed likely given that prosecutors had taken the highly unusual step of siding with the defense in seeking to have the convictions thrown out.But US District Court Judge Stephen V. Wilson, a former prosecutor himself who once worked under Keller in the US Attorney's Office in Los Angeles, was not inclined to simply \"rubber stamp\" the request. Wilson had questions, and his search for answers was going to take time. 'Forevermore'In the eyes of prosecutors in the early 1990s, brothers Nazareth and Vahe Andonian, Raul Vivas, and Juan Carlos Seresi may not have personally committed any acts of violence or handled any kilos of cocaine, but their activities enabled those who did. The more than $300 million the men helped launder, the logic went, kept the cartels in business.Even before trial, Judge Keller, who was appointed to the federal bench by President Ronald Reagan in 1984, made his disdain for such crimes known. \"I intend to deter forevermore anybody doing anything like this,\" he said at a pretrial hearing. At trial, defense attorneys depicted their clients as legitimate businessmen whose participation in any sort of money laundering scheme was unwitting. They acknowledged the men had been involved in massive financial transactions through their precious metal and money exchange companies, but denied they had any knowledge that their activities involved money derived from illicit sources. The Andonian brothers and Vivas were already successful business owners before the alleged crimes began, according to court records. Seresi worked for Vivas.A family portrait of Vahe Andonian prior to his imprisonment.The trial lasted eight months, and the jury was out for another 28 days. The panel could not reach a verdict on drug conspiracy charges against the men, resulting in a hung jury on those charges. But they were each convicted of multiple counts of money laundering and conspiracy.At sentencing, Keller made good on his earlier comment about deterrence. He detailed how he put together a string of consecutive terms intended to put the men away not just for one lifetime, but many. The judge alluded to the apparent finality of the sentences when he temporarily balked at ordering any sort of customary post-release supervision.\"It just flies in the face of common sense,\" Keller said. \"I don't anticipate there is going to be any release.\" On top of the prison terms, Vivas was fined $7.6 million and the Andonians $1.7 million each. Seresi, in a nod to what Keller acknowledged was his \"rather modest means,\" was spared a fine. Nazareth Andonian prior to his arrest in 1989.A key witness breaks his silenceFor two decades, the Andonian brothers, Vivas and Seresi, tried to make the most of life behind bars. They stayed connected with their expanding families, memorized grandkids' birthdays, earned college degrees, worked with their attorneys filing appeals.Juan Carlos Seresi with his grandkids.Their legal efforts, however, always ended in disappointment.But in 2012, a man who played a key role in putting them in prison would set in motion their best chance of getting out.That man is Sergio Hochman, a co-conspirator who once worked at a Los Angeles gold brokerage used in the money laundering scheme, according to court filings.Sergio Hochman.Hochman, who was facing a potential life sentence in a related case, cut an early deal with prosecutors. He spent seven days on the witness stand testifying for the government. He described how \"bulk cash\" from narcotics sales were used to buy gold. The gold was then sold, and the proceeds were wired to Central and South America.Hochman explained a code used to discuss financial transactions at issue in the case and his testimony helped bolster the prosecution's contention that the defendants knew the money was dirty. What jurors didn't know was that Hochman had been receiving special treatment from his FBI handlers, including a handcuff-free seaside lunch in Malibu and visits with his wife in the backseat of a car and in her apartment in Tucson, Arizona.In exchange for his cooperation, Hochman received a sentence of five years and eight months and was released in 1994. In fact, all of the defendants convicted along with Hochman in his case and sentenced by Judge Consuelo B. Marshall have since been released from prison. Hochman first disclosed some \"benefits that he received\" to his own attorney in a conversation 18 years after his release, according to a declaration by the lawyer, Errol Stambler. Stambler said he realized what Hochman was alluding to was new information and pressed him for more detail. He said Hochman was initially \"very reluctant to share more,\" but a few months later signed a sworn declaration detailing the special treatment. In it, he said he had been warned by his FBI agent handlers \"not to disclose those benefits to anyone.\"As a result of the warning, Hochman wrote, \"I remained silent and did not volunteer that information to anyone, not even to my attorney.\"   An unexpected turnFor prosecutors -- and by extension their investigators -- failing to turn over evidence that might point toward a defendant's innocence or raise serious questions about his guilt is considered a cardinal sin and can lead to convictions being overturned. Special treatment given to a key witness by FBI agents and withheld from defense attorneys could fall into that category. Recognizing the potential importance of Hochman's declaration to the imprisoned defendants, Stambler turned the document over to Vivas's attorney, Alan Eisner. Raul Vivas.In 2013, Eisner filed a motion seeking to have his client's conviction overturned based on the newly disclosed information from Hochman. Prosecutors, not surprisingly, were skeptical of Hochman who, as Assistant US Attorney Daffodil Tyminski wrote in 2014, \"has supposedly come forward almost 25 years after the trial.\"Tyminski asked Keller to throw out his declaration, which she argued was \"untimely\" and \"without merit.\" Even if his claims were true, Tyminski wrote, \"there is no reasonable probability that... the result of the proceeding would be different.\"By this time, Keller had gone into \"senior status,\" meaning he had a reduced caseload. The case was ultimately transferred to Wilson, who had once served as one of Keller's top prosecutors in the Los Angeles US Attorney's Office. Seresi and the Andonian brothers later joined Vivas's efforts to have their convictions overturned, since Hochman testified against them as well.The case dragged on for years until last summer, when it took an unexpected turn.Prosecutors were no longer taking the position that Hochman's declaration was \"without merit.\"Just the opposite.  Newly assigned Asst. US Attys. Diana L. Pauli and Michael G. Freedman were siding with the defense. They asked Wilson to throw out each of the men's convictions and order their immediate release.Wilson called a hearing in July to learn more about their rationale. Following some back and forth with one of the prosecutors, the judge said there was no doubt an FBI agent allowing a conjugal visit for a witness who was in federal custody was problematic.\"This is the kind of stuff you see in bad movies, not by FBI agents,\" the judge said. \"It was highly inappropriate and wrongful conduct, but the question is, is this the kind of stuff that would persuade a jury that he was lying?\"Several weeks later, Pauli and Freedman filed a brief at Wilson's request expanding on Hochman's role in the case. They noted that prosecutors \"relied repeatedly on Hochman's testimony to explain certain events\" during the trial and that \"the jury focused on his testimony and appears to have found him credible.\"His special treatment by the FBI, if known to defense attorneys, could have been used to attack his credibility and may have \"altered at least one juror's assessment,\" the prosecutors wrote.Wilson remained unconvinced. At a hearing in November, he asked if the FBI agents had been interviewed about Hochman's allegations.\"Yes, your honor,\" Freedman replied. \"The Government's position is based on what the FBI agents have told us.\"\"I see,\" Wilson said.Most concerning to the judge and prosecutors was the conjugal visit allowed by one of the agents.That agent, now retired, also admitted that he did not divulge the liaison to prosecutors at the time, Freedman said.Wilson said he agreed it was \"a significant nondisclosure,\" and that the agent allowing Hochman to be alone with his wife demonstrated a \"special relationship or special interest.\" Freedman added later that the agent's improper dealings with Hochman could also be used by the defense to attack the agent's overall role in the case, which included collecting evidence and testifying as a witness for the prosecution. Laura Eimiller, a spokeswoman for the FBI in Los Angeles, declined to comment.As the judge continued to pepper Freedman and defense attorneys with questions about the details of the case, Jerry Newton, one of the defense attorneys, reminded Wilson that the defendants had been in prison for three decades and were eager for the judge to render a decision that could potentially result in their freedom.Vahe Andonian in custody. Taken with family members.\"I realize that time is important,\" Wilson said, adding that he wouldn't allow the matter to linger. \"We'll get to it.\" 'A thorough review'More than eight months later, and following inquiries about the case by CNN, Wilson issued a 32-page order earlier this month detailing his findings.In addition to the transcripts of key witness testimony and closing arguments he'd requested and received from prosecutors, the judge explained how he had ordered \"a complete record of the trial\" from the court archives.The thousands of pages of documents filled 18 boxes.\"As is its duty, the Court has undertaken a thorough review,\" Wilson wrote before launching into a detailed analysis of the case and Hochman's role in it.The upshot was that, in Wilson's analysis, Hochman's testimony had been \"helpful\" to the government, but \"not critical.\"\"It is not enough that the government's case would be slightly weaker without Hochman,\" he wrote.He also took aim at the US Attorney's Office where he once worked, blaming prosecutors for being disinterested in the official record of the case and for effectively abandoning their role in the adversarial process.  He said the government \"demonstrated no familiarity\" with the case, \"initially misrepresented to the Court that no trial transcript was available\" and \"did nothing to demonstrate to the Court that it has diligently reviewed the record.\"For those reasons, Wilson explained, he could not simply defer to the US Attorney's Office about whether the failure to disclose the special treatment by the agents was likely to have made a difference in the outcome of the case.The defendants' motions, he wrote, \"are DENIED.\" 'A lot at stake'Within 24 hours of Wilson's order, defense attorneys representing the Andonian brothers filed papers challenging the judge's authority and signaling their intent to appeal.\"The decision to either institute or terminate a prosecution lies with the executive branch of government,\" they wrote. Robert Weisberg, a Stanford University law professor specializing in criminal law and sentencing policy, said it's rare to see prosecutors join defense attorneys in seeking to have a conviction thrown out, and rarer still to see a judge block that from happening.He said it's a gray area under the law and that there's no guarantee Wilson's order will be upheld if appealed.Weisberg said he agreed with the judge's assessment that the special treatment given by the FBI agents was not sufficiently troubling to overturn the convictions. But he wondered if prosecutors would have fared better had they leaned harder on the \"judicial harshness\" of the sentences as background for their primary argument about an alleged constitutional violation.\"This looks like a brutal sentence that would suggest these guys merit a little mercy,\" he said. \"There's a lot at stake here.\"That sentiment was echoed by Tess Lopez, who helped craft hundreds of sentence recommendations during her 13-year tenure as a federal probation officer.Lopez said she watched judges agonize over imposing 20- or 30-year sentences as a result of mandatory minimums. Stacking such already lengthy terms to be served consecutively, as Keller did, is \"really unheard of,\" said Lopez, now a private defense consultant. \"It goes well beyond making an example,\" she said. \"It's very, very, very excessive.\"'A punch in the gut'Lawyers representing the four inmates, now in their 60s and 70s, said their clients, while disappointed, would press forward with an appeal and remained hopeful.\"These guys got a raw deal,\" said Stanley Greenberg, who represents Nazareth Andonian. The sentences they are continuing to serve, he said, \"are grotesquely unfair and cruel.\"Nazareth Andonian.For Seresi, who Judge Keller deemed the least culpable of the 505-year defendants, the cold reality of his current status appears in black and white in his projected release date: July 8, 2419.\"The day that he was sentenced his entire family was sentenced along with him,\" his wife, Maria, wrote in an appeal for clemency to President Barack Obama in 2016. The packet was filled with letters from family and friends attesting to the hardworking, warm-hearted family man Seresi was before his offense, and the studious, model prisoner he has been since.He's earned three associate's degrees while behind bars, speaks with family members over the phone daily and gets weekly visits at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles where he is currently being housed.His oldest daughter, Patti Mawer, was a teenager when he was sentenced and has spent most of her life waiting and hoping for her father's release.Juan Carlos Seresi.Mawer, now 46, said Wilson's order was particularly devastating because his freedom had never seemed so close as when prosecutors sided with the defense in seeking his release.Wilson's decision felt like \"a punch in the gut,\" Mawer said, but added that her father is a fighter who quickly recovered and set the tone for the rest of the family.\"We're very positive. We're moving forward,\" she said. \"This is not the end of the road.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)In the early morning hours of March 13, police in Louisville, Kentucky, arrested a suspected crack cocaine dealer by the name of Jamarcus Glover.Glover was no kingpin. His arrest would not have made national headlines. But having him in handcuffs represented a key moment in a monthslong narcotics probe. Had it ended there it would have been a good night for the police.But in a related, near-simultaneous operation across town, officers wearing tactical vests set up outside an apartment on Louisville's South End with a green door bearing a gold No. 4. It was the home of a young woman detectives suspected was tied to Glover's alleged ring.Her name: Breonna Taylor.Officers used a battering ram to break down Taylor's door, triggering a chain of events that would leave the unarmed 26-year-old woman fatally shot in a barrage of seemingly out-of-control police gunfire. Read MoreLawsuit claims Breonna Taylor lived for '5 to 6 minutes' after being shotUnlike the recent controversial killings of George Floyd and Rayshard Brooks, there is no police body camera video of what transpired in the moments after officers bashed through Taylor's door. And in an era of widespread demand for greater police accountability, it's a case in which achieving a widely agreed upon sense of justice could prove elusive. In the absence of videotape evidence, the circumstances surrounding Taylor's slaying have been widely discussed \u2014 and sometimes distorted \u2014 on social media and by pundits. Among the false claims is that police were conducting a raid at the wrong address, and that an officer injured in the shooting was a victim of \"friendly fire\" by fellow cops. Misconceptions aside, the police operation that night was tragically flawed. A CNN review of the incident found that a key miscalculation by police who assumed Taylor was home alone when she was in fact accompanied by a boyfriend who was legally armed, coupled with the decision to press forward with a high-risk, forced entry under questionable circumstances, contributed to the deadly outcome. This story is based on a review of search warrant affidavits, audio recordings of the official statements of key participants, 911 recordings and interviews with more than a dozen people.The chaotic scene that night was exacerbated by an officer accused by his own department of \"blindly\" firing 10 rounds into Taylor's apartment from an outdoor patio. He's since been fired and is appealing his termination. A photo from the scene of Breonna Taylor's death provided by Sam Aguiar, the attorney of Breonna Taylor's familyPolice officials and prosecutors declined comment for this report, citing an ongoing investigation. Attempts to reach Glover, who faces drug trafficking charges stemming from the incident, were unsuccessful. His attorney said his client intends to plead not guilty but declined further comment. Walter Katz, a veteran police oversight expert who has monitored departments in Los Angeles, San Jose and Chicago, called the known circumstances surrounding Taylor's death \"very problematic,\" and indicative of systemic flaws in training and tactics.The investigation, which now includes the state attorney general's office and the FBI, is being closely watched not just in Kentucky, but across the US.Five warrants approved Around noon on March 12, a Louisville police detective presented Jefferson County Circuit Court Judge Mary Shaw with a stack of five search warrant applications for her approval, according to court records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you have a tip or sensitive material to share with CNN?\n\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\n\n\n\n\nThey were for locations linked to Glover, a convicted felon suspected of supplying a local drug house. One of the places to be searched was Taylor's apartment.Police said Glover used Taylor's residence as his \"current home address\" as of a February 20 check of various online computer databases and had been receiving mail there, a three-page affidavit for a search warrant written by Detective Joshua C. Jaynes states. The detective said he saw Glover \"walk directly\" into Taylor's apartment in mid-January and leave a short time later with a package. He then drove straight to a \"known drug house,\" Jaynes stated. Taylor's car, the detective noted, had been seen parked outside another alleged drug house linked to Glover \"on different occasions.\" The affidavit did not document any activity regarding Taylor or her residence in March. Breonna Taylor death: Detective who applied for warrant put on administrative reassignmentBesides seeking approval for the searches, police wanted the judge to give them permission to execute the warrants without having to knock on the door, meaning officers could force entry if they saw fit. Such extreme tactics are supposed to be reserved for cases in which police fear suspects may try to arm themselves or are considered likely to destroy evidence if given the opportunity in the moments before a raid. Serving so-called \"no-knock\" warrants is considered among the most dangerous work in law enforcement. Police are supposed to precisely articulate for judges why such actions are needed in a given case. For each of his five warrants, Jaynes used identical language seeking to justify the no-knock entry: \"These drug traffickers have a history of attempting to destroy evidence, have cameras on the location that compromise Detectives once an approach to the dwelling is made, and have a history of fleeing from law enforcement.\"  The judge approved all the searches and gave the police permission to force entry into the locations if needed.In a written statement provided to CNN, Judge Shaw declined to discuss the details of the warrant, saying she was \"restrained in my ability to comment on ongoing legal matters.\" But, she said, she took more than 30 minutes to review and consider the warrant applications and \"made the probable cause determination required of me by law.\"Shaw added that Taylor's death was a tragedy that \"will stay with me forever.\"Lawyers for Taylor's family would later attack Jaynes' affidavit for Taylor's residence as weak and misleading. For example, any mail Glover may have received at her apartment would have been innocuous items such as clothes or shoes, one of the attorneys told CNN.\"It definitely wasn't drugs.\"'We kept banging'Hours after Shaw signed the warrants, police began the operation, conducting near-simultaneous raids at the various locations.Taylor's apartment, according to police, was considered a less volatile, \"soft target.\" As such, police commanders decided in advance to have officers knock and announce their presence before entry. That decision was communicated in a pre-operational briefing, according to a source familiar with the details of the operation who requested anonymity due to the ongoing investigation.There's a renewed call for police body cameras. Here's why that may not be the right solutionSometime after 12:30 a.m., Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly began pounding on the door. He later told investigators he believed Taylor was alone and he wanted to give her sufficient time to answer.As officers waited for a response, a neighbor poked his head out to ask what was going on. One of the officers, Brett Hankison, extended his gun and told the neighbor to get back inside his apartment, Mattingly would later tell investigators.\"Brett was a little bit worked up,\" Mattingly said. \"I remember looking at Brett, saying, 'Brett, relax. Brett, just relax. Relax.\" When there was no answer after repeated knocks, Mattingly said, he announced he was a police officer there to serve a search warrant.\"Police. Come to the door,\" he said.Another officer on the search team said he heard movement inside and thought someone was about to answer the door.\"We kept banging and announcing,\" Mattingly said, but still no one answered. Eventually, a lieutenant at the scene gave the order to \"go ahead and hit\" the door with the battering ram, Mattingly said. 'Who is it?'Taylor had been watching a movie in bed together with her boyfriend Kenneth Walker when she drifted off to sleep beside him. Walker told investigators he heard banging at the door after midnight and his first thought was that it was Glover. He said he knew Taylor had dated the accused drug dealer during their on-and-off seven-year relationship. He was concerned there might be trouble. Taylor, who had awoken, shouted, \"Who is it\"?Walker said there was no response. He said he and Taylor scrambled to get dressed and that he grabbed his gun, which his attorney said he legally owns.The pounding at the door continued, he said. \"She's yelling at the top of her lungs \u2014 and I am too at this point \u2014 who is it?\" he recalled. \"No answer. No response. No anything.\"As they made their way down a hallway toward the front door, Walker said, the door flew off its hinges.\"So I just let off one shot,\" he said. \"I still can't see who it is or anything.\"Following orders and police procedureMattingly was first through the door. He could make out a man and a woman in the darkened hallway, he said, and the man had a gun in his hand.\"I remember seeing the barrel,\" Mattingly said.Then, in an instant, he saw the flash of the muzzle and felt the heat of a bullet in his leg. The round had severed his femoral artery. Mattingly returned fire, squeezing off multiple shots in rapid succession.\"Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom,\" he recalled. In all, he said he fired six times. He remembered falling to the ground and being helped to safety outside the apartment before hearing fellow officers return fire.Hankison and Officer Myles Cosgrove were later identified as the other officers who discharged their weapons that evening.An attorney for Cosgrove declined comment. Hankison's attorney did not respond to calls and emails from CNN. Mattingly's attorney, Todd McMurtry, defended his client's conduct. \"Sgt. Mattingly was following orders of superior officers, was not involved in the planning process of the arrest, and at all times followed established police procedures,\" he said.None of the officers has been charged with a crime.Louisville police officers Myles Cosgrove, Brett Hankison and Jonathan Mattingly. Hankison was fired by Louisville's police chief for his role in the shooting.'Help'Inside the apartment, Walker was unharmed. But Taylor lay on the ground beside him, bleeding profusely. There were bullet holes everywhere, including in a neighboring apartment where a young child lived.Walker punched 911 into his cell phone.His voice sounds distraught as he tells the dispatcher someone had kicked in the door and shot his girlfriend. As the operator peppered him with questions, Walker repeatedly moaned his girlfriend's nickname \u2014 \"Bre\" \u2014 and the word \"help.\"In the minutes after the shooting, Louisville police swarmed the parking lot of Taylor's apartment complex.Cell phone video shot by a neighbor and posted on social media by Taylor's sister captured the scene:Officers with guns drawn shout commands from behind squad cars, as Walker walks backwards out of the complex with his hands in the air.A photo from the scene of Breonna Taylor's death provided by Sam Aguiar, the attorney of Breonna Taylor's familyHe was taken away in handcuffs. Six days later, a grand jury indicted him of attempted murder of a police officer.The indictment was returned following a brief presentation in which members of the panel were essentially told only that Walker had opened fire on the police during a raid and that one of the officers had been hit. Grand jurors were not told that Walker said he was unaware the people who broke through Taylor's door were police and that he believed he was acting in self-defense. Nor was the panel told of Taylor's death.No drugs were found in the apartmentIn May, Walker's defense attorney, Rob Eggert, filed a motion to have the indictment dismissed. He said the prosecution's presentation to the panel \"completely mischaracterizes\" what took place on the night Taylor was killed and that the grand jury was \"woefully misled.\"\"Their way out of this was to bury my guy,\" Eggert told CNN in a recent interview. \"And that's not right.\"A day later, in a surprise move, the Louisville area's top local prosecutor agreed to have the indictment against Walker dismissed. Thomas Wine, the Commonwealth's Attorney for Jefferson County, said he disagreed that grand jurors had been misled, but agreed that it was important for them to hear from Walker directly before deciding whether to indict. If, after further investigation, the case was brought back to the grand jury, Wine said, Walker would be given that opportunity.'A shock to the conscience'Taylor's shooting was well covered by the Louisville Courier Journal in the days and weeks after it occurred. But the case received comparatively little national exposure.That changed following the May 25 police slaying of Floyd in Minneapolis, Minneapolis, that sparked weeks of protests in cities around the country. Taylor's case exploded into the national consciousness alongside Floyd's.Last month, the Louisville city council passed Breonna's Law, which banned no-knock warrants and requires officers serving search warrants to wear body cameras.Eight days later, Louisville's newly appointed police chief gave Hankison a termination letter. The FBI has opened an investigation into the shooting death of Kentucky EMT Breonna TaylorThe chief accused Hankison of blindly firing 10 rounds into Taylor's apartment through a covered patio door and window that prevented him from assessing any threat posed by the occupants before opening fire. Some of his rounds penetrated a neighboring apartment and endangered the lives of three of its occupants, the letter stated.\"I find your conduct a shock to the conscience,\" the chief wrote. \"Your actions have brought discredit upon yourself and the Department ... and demands your termination.\"The department's Public Integrity Unit has completed a formal investigation into the shooting, but the results of the probe have not been publicly released. Meanwhile, FBI agents have taken documents from Louisville police investigators, according to a source familiar with the matter. At Taylor's apartment complex, agents have been interviewing her former neighbors, one resident told CNN.Katz, the police oversight expert, said he believes there has been mounting pressure on prosecutors across the country to stop giving undue deference to the police version of events in controversial uses of force.But a case like Taylor's, which has no video, demands a methodical, painstaking investigation that could take significant time to complete, he said.One key area of dispute in the case is whether police announced their presence before breaking down the door.Mattingly told investigators he and others did so repeatedly. Walker said he never heard anyone say \"police\" and that his and Taylor's shouts of \"who is it?\" were met with silence.CNN interviewed several of Taylor's neighbors, either directly or through their attorney. Most said they were awakened by the gunfire and therefore did not hear what preceded it.'Truly, definitely missed'Taylor's aunt, Bianca Austin, and Taylor's sister, Ju'Niyah Palmer, say they want the police officers involved in her death to be charged with murder.  In a recent interview in a park overlooking downtown Louisville, Taylor's sister and aunt spoke about the circumstances surrounding her slaying, and what they hope will come of her death.Her aunt, Bianca Austin, described Taylor as a \"spunky, goofy little kid\" who blossomed into a hard-working, goal-oriented young woman who placed an emphasis on family. At the time of her death, she had been working as a certified emergency medical technician. \"She just was a fun person to be around,\" Austin said. \"She's going to be truly, definitely be missed.\"The loss has been so devastating on Taylor's mother that she spent this past Mother's Day in her room, refusing to get out of bed.Taylor's sister, Ju'Niyah Palmer, who was also her roommate and best friend, acknowledged that Taylor had a past relationship with Glover. But she said her sister wasn't involved in Glover's alleged drug operation and had forbade him from bringing that aspect of his life into her personal life.\"You cannot come up in my house with any drugs,\" she quoted her sister as telling Glover. \"My sister live(s) here and I can't jeopardize her getting hurt because of what you do.\"She said Taylor had nothing to hide in her apartment and would have been happy to prove that to the police if she'd known it was them at the door.\"If they were to come in and say, 'Hey, you sell drugs', she'd be like ... that's not who I am,\" Palmer said.Both women faulted the police for Taylor's killing and said the officers involved should be charged with murder.\"We're going to fight this to the end,\" her aunt said. \"This is our baby and she's going to get the justice she deserves.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)As complaints about dire shortages of protective gear for medical workers on the frontlines of the Covid-19 crisis began to stream in, President Donald Trump was quick to point the finger of blame at his predecessor, Barack Obama.It was Obama and other administrations, he said, who left the shelves of the nation's Strategic National Stockpile bare of the items needed to combat the coronavirus. To an extent, the President was right. The Obama administration did use and then failed to replace items from the stockpile to fight the 2009 H1N1 \"swine flu\" pandemic. But Trump hadn't replaced those items either, despite repeated warnings that the country was ill-prepared for a pandemic, stockpile experts said.The President's criticism also ignored a key point: The stockpile was never intended -- or funded -- to be a panacea for a pandemic. Rather, it serves as one piece of the overall supply chain puzzle during a disaster.Read More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\n\n\n\nThe stockpile's inadequacies quickly came to light in the coronavirus pandemic -- a devastating health crisis that experts have long predicted. Trump delayed striking deals with the private sector and invoking the Defense Production Act (DPA) to produce more medical supplies, making a bad situation worse. And states -- bidding against one another and other countries for supplies at sharp markups -- turned to the quick relief of the stockpile, only to find it understocked and the federal stewards overseeing it in disarray.The picture was complicated even further when a whistleblower alleged this week that the system of deciding what to put in the stockpile had been corrupted by outside lobbyists and politically driven decision-making, rather than science. \"People who somehow believed it was a bottomless pit filled with everything they can imagine were not paying attention,\" said Tara O'Toole, a physician and former Department of Homeland Security official who once chaired an advisory committee on the stockpile.If politicians were surprised to discover that, \"then shame on them,\" she said.Asked about why his administration hadn't replenished the bare cupboards he complained about, Trump suggested in an interview aired Tuesday that he was too busy dealing with scandals\u2014the President called them \"hoaxes\"\u2014that have marred the first three years of his administration.\"Well, I'll be honest with you,\" Trump told ABC News Anchor David Muir. \"I (had) a lot of things going on.\"President Donald Trump speaks during the daily coronavirus task force briefing at the White House on April 24, 2020. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)'The difference between life and death'States quickly realized the stockpile wasn't going to be their savior.The federal government assured Illinois hundreds of thousands of N95 respirator masks were on the way, Illinois Deputy Gov. Christian Mitchell said. But when the trucks arrived, the masks turned out to be surgical masks -- insufficient protection for the health care workers treating patients with the devastating virus.The difference in the masks is \"the difference between life and death,\" for frontline health care workers, Mitchell said. \"What we have gotten out of the Strategic National Stockpile has not been what we were promised or what we were owed.\"Similar complaints popped up across the country. Some states questioned whether supplies were being distributed equitably. Others reported receiving supplies that had passed their expiration date, had deteriorated or were not properly maintained.  When California received 170 ventilators from the federal stockpile that were not in working condition, it enlisted Bloom Energy, which normally produces clean energy fuel cells, to help refurbish the machines.How coronavirus testing fumbles squandered valuable time\"The only feedback we had was, 'These ventilators are not working,'\" Bloom's chief operations officer Susan Brennan said.The ventilators had never been used but they also hadn't been prepped and preventative maintenance had not been performed, Brennan said. Bloom's team replaced batteries, calibrated oxygen settings, tested air flows and turned the rehabbed ventilators around in about 24 hours.There were also maintenance issues with the remaining supplies in the stockpile. The government held 10,000 ventilators in reserve in anticipation of a surge in the coronavirus, Trump said in April. But about 20% of those ventilators were not in shape to be deployed because of a lapse in the government contract to keep the machines maintained, a source familiar with the matter said.  A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said, \"All ventilators deployed from the SNS are in operating condition and maintained based on the original manufacturer's specifications outlined in the service manual.\"The HHS inspector general announced last month it would conduct an audit of whether the stockpile was effectively managed during the coronavirus crisis.\"We've always reviewed aspects of the Department's planning and response to emergencies,\" a spokesperson for the inspector general said. \"In this case, however, the ongoing public health crisis prompted this review.\"  'Under wraps'Greg Burel likened his job as director of the Strategic National Stockpile to managing a Home Depot for disasters. He kept track of some $8 billion worth of supplies and oversaw an annual budget in the hundreds of millions.Despite his national security clearance ending with his retirement in January, a related non-disclosure agreement prevents him from saying much more about the secretive national stash he supervised for nearly 13-years. He won't say precisely how many facilities there are -- that's classified -- or what exactly is in them -- also classified.Trucks stand ready to deploy caches of medical supplies from the Strategic National Stockpile, \nMarch 10, 2020. \"We keep it pretty much under wraps. The reason we do that is so a determined enemy can't figure out how to do something bad to us,\" Burel explained. \"If somebody knows what's in it, they can say, 'Well, if they can take care of the zombie apocalypse, but they can't take care of something else, well, we'll do the something else.'\"Still, bits and pieces of the stockpile's history can be gleaned from congressional testimony, government websites and obscure publications such as the Domestic Preparedness Journal, in which Burel wrote a three-part series on the SNS shortly before his retirement.The stockpile was created in 1999 amid fears of a bioterrorism attack coinciding with the Y2K computer switch over. Dubbed the National Pharmaceutical Stockpile at the time, the idea was to establish and maintain a sufficient supply of medicine and medical equipment in strategic locations around the US to be able to quickly help state and local communities in the wake of an attack with agents such as anthrax, smallpox, plague or other pathogens.That Y2K attack never came. But the stockpile was tapped following another disaster soon thereafter: On September 11, 2001, planes delivering stockpile supplies to New York City were the only flights allowed in American skies other than military aircraft and Air Force One.In the wake of 9/11, the stockpile was given its current name: Strategic National Stockpile. It was used again in the early 2000s in response to a series of anthrax attacks around the US and ultimately supplied with enough medication to treat up to 12 million people.'Mind-boggling': How pandemic planning never accounted for a President like TrumpIn the years since the SNS has been used in response to a variety of disasters, from outbreaks of Zika, Ebola and botulism to flooding and 10 major hurricanes, including Katrina, Sandy and Maria.The event most comparable to the Covid-19 crisis was in 2009, when the SNS was used to fortify the response to the H1N1 \"swine flu\" pandemic. In 2003, under the George W. Bush administration, Burel said it had begun stockpiling massive quantities of antiviral medication and supplies in anticipation of pandemic influenza. It marked the first departure from its original mission of preparing for a terrorist attack.When H1N1 hit, the stockpile unleashed its largest deployment ever -- millions of drugs, masks and other protective gear for health workers across all 50 states.Those supplies were never replenished, partly because Congress declined the Obama administration's repeated requests to increase funding.Burel said the normally low-profile SNS has received more attention in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis than at any point in its history.One problem with all that attention, he said, is that \"everybody then infers that it was supposed to be the place to get anything and everything you need for any kind of health care event. But the reality is it was never designed for that. And it was never funded for that.\"Enough supplies? 'Well, of course not' It wasn't a secret that the US didn't have adequate supplies on hand to fight a pandemic. Experts had been telling politicians as much for years. The warnings continued into the Trump administration before the pandemic, which transferred management of the SNS away from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to another arm of HHS.Robert Kadlec, the assistant secretary for preparedness and response who is now in charge of the stockpile, prioritized preparing for a bioterrorism attack over a naturally occurring pandemic, he said in a recent interview with the Washington Post.Still, he warned a congressional panel in December that \"supply chain issues are among the most significant challenges to preparing for an influenza pandemic as well as other infectious diseases.\" Kadlec testified America depended on overseas production for everything from gloves to pharmaceuticals.\"In a pandemic environment, this dependence could become a matter of national security, as we witnessed during the H1N1 pandemic of 2009,\" Kadlec said.When HHS Secretary Alex Azar appeared before lawmakers in February seeking additional funding to combat the coronavirus, senators asked what was already available in the stockpile.Azar told them there were masks and ventilators on hand.Asked whether there were enough, he responded, \"Well, of course not. ...This is an unprecedented potential severe health challenge globally, and will require additional measures.\"  'It's supposed to be our stockpile'President Donald Trump, flanked by senior advisor Jared Kushner, speaks during the coronavirus task force briefing at the White House on April 2, 2020.Disappointing returns from the stockpile and an overall erratic federal response had already shaken states' confidence in the administration.Then came Jared Kushner.More of CNN's coronavirus coverageMap: Covid-19's spread across the USReopening: Where your state standsPhotos: With cities on lockdown, animals find room to roamVideo: Economic recovery hinges on human behaviorGuide: How to help and get helpQ&A: What is contact tracing?When Kushner, the President's senior adviser and son-in-law, was charged with working on the supply chain, it initially inspired a sigh of relief, according to several government agency sources.   The idea of a point person seemed a step in the right direction after officials with HHS and the Federal Emergency Management Agency spent a month sorting out their respective roles in ramping production of personal protective equipment and tests needed for the Covid-19 response.But enthusiasm quickly faded as it became clear that Kushner's involvement was adding more confusion to the already chaotic response, one source said.Appearing in the briefing room in early April, Kushner claimed, \"The notion of the federal stockpile was it's supposed to be our stockpile; it's not supposed to be state stockpiles that they then use.\"Kushner's assessment flew in the face of the official definition of the stockpile from its website. The language was quickly changed a day after Kushner's statement to skew closer to his interpretation.  Officials across the country were gobsmacked.For Illinois, it was another sign they were on their own to replenish critical medical supplies. It left the state in a \"Lord of the Flies\" battle for supplies against other states and countries, Mitchell said.In quest for vaccine, US makes 'big bet' on company with unproven technology \"If I am successful in procuring a mask, an N95 mask for a health care worker in the state of Illinois, that very often may mean that there's a health care worker in Wisconsin or Michigan or Georgia or California who now does not have an N95 mask,\" Mitchell said. \"We have been pitted against each other in a way that's literally going to cost us lives that could have been saved and that is on the White House.\"Mitchell said he's also concerned states could be left on their own -- fighting in an international bidding war -- to acquire a life-saving vaccine, once one becomes available.\"Based on what we've seen, it's not a crazy scenario,\" he said.The HHS spokesperson said the stockpile is not responsible for distributing the vaccine but the \"SNS is working now with federal and commercial supply chain partners to ensure ancillary supplies such as needles and syringes are produced and available in adequate quantities for a nationwide vaccination campaign once a vaccine is made available.\"Blame game \"When I took this over, it was an empty box,\" the President said in a March briefing. \"And I'm not just blaming President Obama. You go long before that.\"During the H1N1 influenza pandemic, the stockpile distributed 12.5 million antiviral regiments, 19.6 million pieces of PPE and 85.1 million N95 masks, according to a 2016 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.

Smith/AFP/Getty Images)The Obama administration didn't replace those supplies, nor did the Trump administration take the initiative to do so until it found itself in the midst of a global pandemic.The US needed 3.5 billion N95 respirator masks for a \"severe event,\" HHS' Kadlec told the Senate in March. There were only 12 million in the stockpile, Azar said in February, along with another 5 million N95s he believed were past their expiration date.It took weeks of politicians and health care workers openly begging for supplies before Trump flipped the switch on the DPA and launched public-private partnerships aimed at easing the shortages.Months before the administration ramped up production, at least one major mask-maker was reaching out to the federal government warning that shortages were imminent. But Kadlec and others ignored the mask-maker's repeated offers to ramp up production, according to the whistleblower complaint filed by Dr. Rick Bright, a top HHS official and one of Kadlec's deputies.More of CNN's coronavirus coverageMap: Covid-19's spread across the USReopening: Where your state standsPhotos: With cities on lockdown, animals find room to roamVideo: Economic recovery hinges on human behaviorGuide: How to help and get helpQ&A: What is contact tracing?When the administration finally struck production deals, it would take even longer for American manufacturers, who have shifted so much production overseas, to build out production capacity in the US.When Moldex-Metric, the second-largest disposable respiratory mask-maker in the US, secured a major mask-making contract with HHS, it also began pursuing ways to add equipment and production lines.\"There's only so much capacity to make these in the United States. Most of the manufacturers here have their plants, and we can run them 24/7 and hit capacity,\"  James Hornstein, general counsel for Moldex-Metric, said last month. After H1N1, \"no one came to us and said we want you to ramp up your automated manufacturing lines, so you can make more when you turn on the switch.\" The failure to keep American cupboards stocked with crucial medical supplies stretches back across administration and across party lines.Public health and national security experts say politicians have consistently failed to treat public health issues, such as emerging infectious diseases, and the fragile supply chain surrounding them as a serious national security threat.Pointing fingers over the stockpile \"is the politicians diverting from the fact that they were basically negligent,\" O'Toole said. Lucrative contracts based on political connections'In the whistleblower complaint filed Tuesday, Bright said the stockpile's mission had been compromised by politics well before it began making headlines in connection with the coronavirus.Bright was involved in procuring medicines and other material for the SNS and said he was pressured \"to award lucrative contracts based on political connections and cronyism.\"Ousted vaccine director files whistleblower complaint alleging coronavirus warnings were ignoredBright, who was reassigned from his role as the director of the Biomedical and Advanced Research Development Authority, said that pressure included an \"outsized role\" played by a pharmaceutical industry consultant who represented a company whose CEO purportedly had ties to Kushner.Bright's complaint details Kadlec's alleged efforts to steer contracts to companies represented by the industry consultant with whom he had \"a long standing connection.\" In one case, Kadlec directed $40 million to SNS to fund a drug that expert advisers deemed \"inferior\" to alternatives, according to the complaint. In another case that was the subject of an inspector generation investigation, a $55 million contract was awarded -- over the objection of expert advisers -- to a company the consultant represented, Bright's complaint alleges.Bright's allegations mirror concerns raised by Tom Frieden, who served as director of the CDC under Obama.In interview with CNN last month, Frieden lamented what he called the \"misguided, politicized and corrupt\" transfer of the SNS away from the CDC to Kadlec's office in late 2018.Other experts on the stockpile supported the change, but Frieden said the change ushered in a new standard for how the SNS did business.\"The basis for decisions used to be how to save the most lives\" he said. \"Now, it's how to satisfy the most lobbyists.\"Kadlec could not be reached for comment about Bright's complaint. A statement released by HHS after it was filed on Tuesday did not offer a detailed response to the document.A stockpile '10 times' biggerVice President Mike Pence gestures while visiting the General Motors/Ventec ventilator production facility in Kokomo, Ind., April 30, 2020.There are signs the administration is already rethinking how to prepare the stockpile for the next disaster. Congress allocated $16 billion in one of the coronavirus relief packages to bolster the stockpile with supplies like masks, respirators and pharmaceuticals. Trump has vowed: \"We're building up our stockpile again like crazy.\" And White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said the US needs \"bigger and better insurance policies.\"\"So we are going to look at stockpiles that are probably 10 times as big,\" Navarro said last week on a visit to a General Motors plant making ventilators. Despite the assurances, a FEMA spokesperson said, \"As of right now, there is no effort being made to replenish the stockpile. Inventory that is available is being used to fill urgent needs of the states to help mitigate PPE burn rates.\"Experts are skeptical that a stockpile of any size can adequately prepare the US unless there are other changes, including more domestic manufacturing of medical supplies and a commitment from hospitals to keep more protective equipment on hand.\"We cannot stockpile our way out of these situations no matter how big the stockpile,\" O'Toole said. \"We took our eye off the ball in allowing our entire supply chain to move to other countries.\"  Navarro said the administration was also \"going to think differently about how the stockpiles actually exist,\" which might include ensuring American manufacturers have reserve capacity they can quickly bring online in a crisis. As for Burel, he's watching the crisis unfold from his new perch as the president of a consulting firm. He left his post as stockpile director on January 3, 2020, a retirement date he says he had planned since shortly after he began working for the government as an intern.Had he known further in advance that Covid-19 was coming, he said, \"I would have delayed everything.\"From the sidelines, he said he hopes that this crisis leads to a permanent increase in its funding rather than a one-time infusion.  \"If the country wants the SNS to be the savior for these kinds of things,\" Burel told CNN, \"it's gonna have to tell Congress to fund it.\" The price tag for that, he said, would be in the billions annually.

        "content": "(CNN)As coronavirus test kits were malfunctioning in public health labs across the country, Dr. Robert Redfield repeatedly assured his fellow task force officials in February that the problem would be quickly solved. The White House had little reason to doubt Redfield. His agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had a storied history as the preeminent testing authority.Even as the problem persisted and days stretched into weeks, Redfield and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar -- then the lead of the coronavirus task force -- provided \"assurances it was being dealt with,\" a senior administration official said. Most other members of the recently created White House task force -- officials from the chief of staff's office and the National Security Council -- weren't public health experts. They placed their faith in the nation's top health officials. \"When the CDC, who was has always been able to handle these things -- when they tell us they have this thing under control, who are we to say, 'You double PhDs, MDs who have been doing this for years, no you're wrong,'\" said the administration official.Read MoreIt took roughly three weeks to sort out the failed test kits, far longer than the CDC had anticipated. Along the way, regulators would discover the lab producing the test kits was contaminated, likely causing the tests to malfunction, according to a senior administration official.  CDC Director Robert Redfield leaves the Capitol after he and others from the coronavirus task force briefed Congress in February (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)Officials would scramble to cobble together a solution to get diagnostic tests to the states. And throughout it all, the deadly virus ---- far more contagious than health experts initially thought -- was spreading across the country, largely undetected.In addition to squandering time on the flawed test, federal officials failed to ensure there would be ample testing supplies to support the effort, established such restrictive testing guidelines that sick people were being denied tests, and did not  fully enact a 2018 agreement with public and private labs aimed at quickly enlisting their help in such a health crisis. By the time commercial labs were brought into the effort, the demand for tests was so high that backlogs further delayed results, CNN found. The Trump administration's failure to quickly scale up testing would continue to cripple the US response to the pandemic for months. Even now -- three months after the first detected case of the coronavirus in the US -- testing remains a key challenge to President Donald Trump's push to reopen the economy. \"There's very little that has gone well. Actually, I'm not sure what has gone well,\" said Scott Becker, who heads a national association of health labs and has been deeply immersed in the response to the crisis. \"It's just been a continuing cascade of challenges.\"Caitlin Oakley, an HHS spokeswoman, defended testing efforts under Azar.\"Secretary Azar responded with urgency at every step of the response and continues to do so,\" she said in a statement to CNN. Any insinuation that he didn't is \"just plain wrong and disproven by the facts.\"A CDC spokesman said Redfield did not offer any assurances about how long it would take to fix the testing problem because the CDC didn't know what was causing it at the time.This account of the administration's struggle to build a widespread testing infrastructure is based on documents from public records requests, internal records from a private testing facility obtained by CNN, and interviews with current and former government officials, public health experts, doctors and scientists.The test fails Medical personnel in San Francisco secure a sample from a person at a drive-thru coronavirus testing station in March.  (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Public health officials were eagerly awaiting the CDC test kits when they were shipped out Feb. 6.In Orange County, Calif., staffers in the public health lab worked over the weekend to get the test up and running. They quickly grew frustrated, realizing they couldn't validate the test.\"Lab networks talk,\" said Dr. Matt Zahn, medical director for the communicable disease control division of the Orange County Health Care Agency. \"We were all talking to each other around the country saying there is a problem here. What wasn't clear is what the solution to that would be.\"Zahn knew the virus was likely circulating in the community because California has a lot of travelers to and from Asia. His mind drifted to worst-case scenarios.\"If a virus gets into healthcare facilities, gets into hospitals, gets into nursing homes -- that was our major concern,\" he said. \"It was just really tough.\"Within days of shipping out the tests, the CDC began getting reports that they weren't functioning properly. By Feb. 10, more than half the states were reporting problems with the test kits, a federal official said.The CDC notified the Food and Drug Administration about the problem and began consulting with the FDA on ways to fix it.In the meantime, the only way to test a coronavirus patient in the US was to collect a sample and send it to the CDC for testing. On average, the official said in those initial testing days it took \"three to four days\" to get a result back to the person who took the specimen.Leadership vacuumPresident Donald Trump speaks about the coronavirus at the White House on April 13, 2020, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)It was the sort of problem that Trump boasts he's well-suited to solve: Test kits desperately needed to track and help control the rapidly spreading coronavirus were partly tangled in government red tape that needed to be cut. The clock was ticking.Lives were on the line.But for weeks, the President, who casts himself as a take-charge, hands-on, problem-solver-in-chief continued to publicly downplay the entire coronavirus threat even as the debacle over a botched government test played out.There was a leadership vacuum in the West Wing as acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney had fallen out of favor with Trump, but his replacement, Mark Meadows, had not yet been named.The result was no early, coordinated push from the White House to scale up testing, perhaps by pursuing alternatives, like authorizing the test the World Health Organization had distributed to other countries or soliciting help from labs in commercial, hospital or university settings.  In fact, the government had a signed agreement to deal with just such a crisis. In 2018, on the heels of the Zika virus scare, officials realized the need to engage commercial labs in testing at the outset of an outbreak. But the pact was not enacted to speed up testing in the early stages of the Covid-19 response. As for the President, he was still in denial and publicly predicting the virus would \"miraculously\" go away. Sleepless nightsBecker, CEO of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, was having trouble sleeping.He had been \"peppering CDC constantly\" for an update on when new tests for the virus would be distributed.He's been on calls with the CDC since before the initial roll out.\"We all knew there was a problem,\" Becker recalled in an interview with CNN.\"It was desperation. We have to break through this,\" he recalled thinking as the delay continued. \"I was panicking. I was just trying to rack my brain, thinking about 'what can we do?'Send us your stories about coronavirus testingHe woke up on Sunday, Feb. 23 with \"a crazy idea\": To write the FDA and seek permission for the labs he represents to \"create and implement\" their own tests.\"We recognize the gravity of the current Covid-19 situation across the globe,\" Becker and a colleague wrote to FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn the following day. \"Hence this extraordinary and rare request.\" Two days later, Hahn effectively greenlit Becker's proposal, allowing his group's labs to apply to design a test under one blanket application as opposed to having to file them separately.FDA officials insist that the labs had always had the ability to create their own tests. But FDA regulations, specially imposed once a state of emergency had been declared, proved daunting to commercial and clinical labs. Around this same time, Redfield, the CDC director, appeared before a Congressional subcommittee. In prepared remarks, he talked about the CDC's testing rollout earlier that month and acknowledged \"an issue with one of the testing components was discovered.\"He did not detail the problem or say what caused it, according to the statement, but told committee members his agency was \"working on remanufacturing the test kit.\" President Donald Trump speaks at a news conference on the Covid-19 outbreak. (Photo by Andrew Caballero-Reynolds-via Getty Images)ContaminatedBehind the scenes a more troublesome issue was emerging: In its rush to create tests, the CDC had done so in one of its laboratories rather than one of its manufacturing facilities, compromising the manufacturing process, according to administration officials. \"CDC did not manufacture its test consistent with its own protocol,\" an FDA  spokesperson said.FDA officials were getting mixed messages in mid-February about why the CDC test kits were malfunctioning. At first it appeared to be a manufacturing issue, but then the CDC suggested it could be a problem related to the test design, according to two FDA officials.That was worrisome to the FDA. On Feb. 22, a diagnostics expert at the agency, traveled to Atlanta and spent a couple of days at the CDC labs trying to figure out what was going on.According to an administration official, the FDA determined contamination was most likely occurring during the manufacturing process and that was causing the tests to malfunction. CDC spokesman Benjamin Haynes said the matter is being investigated. \"Routine quality control measures aim to identify these types of issues. Those measures were not sufficient in this circumstance, and CDC implemented enhanced quality control to address the issue and will be assessing this issue moving forward,\" Haynes said. Another federal official conceded: \"There was a rush to get kits out to the states, that might have led to some of the mistakes that were made in our lab, that's fair.\"In the final days of February, the FDA and the CDC worked out two solutions.The test kits the CDC already manufactured had three components, the third of which was malfunctioning. But the tests worked using two of the three components. So, the CDC and the FDA instructed states to use the original CDC test, but eliminate the test's third component.The CDC would also work with an outside manufacturer, IDT, to remanufacture test kits to be shipped to public health labs across the country.\"There's no question mistakes were made in the labs. And then you couple that with the regulatory process. It explains the weeks delay,\" the federal official said.\"That's the way it is.\"Everyone stays on this callCDC Director Robert Redfield and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, attend a briefing on the administration's coronavirus response.  (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Alarmed by the delay in getting tests up and running, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, asked for administration officials to convene by phone on Feb. 27, according to a senior administration official.Azar's chief of staff made clear to the call's participants -- which included FDA Commissioner Hahn, CDC Director Redfield, and other senior FDA and HHS aides -- that everyone was staying on the call until they could figure out a way to solve the testing shortage, the official said. A solution emerged: Loosen the FDA regulations to pave an easier path for outside labs to jump in on coronavirus testing.The FDA announced the change Feb. 29, effectively opening the floodgates for clinical labs to ramp up their coronavirus testing efforts.\"The FDA's regulations have not hindered or been a roadblock to the rollout of tests during this pandemic,\" Hahn said in a March 30 statement.Invisible enemyThe delays in coronavirus testing would prove costly.Many officials initially underestimated how contagious the coronavirus would be. Initial guidelines from the CDC called for screening patients for travel only from Wuhan, China, which immediately raised red flags with other public health officials.\"We will be instructing our healthcare providers to ask about any travel from China as we expect this to broaden in the very near future,\" Arkansas Secretary of Health Nathaniel Smith wrote to other state health officials across the country on Jan. 21 -- the day the first US case of the coronavirus was reported. It was one of the thousands of emails obtained by CNN in public records requests.The CDC was slow to broaden its geographical screening guidelines to include the rest of Asia as well as Europe. And its list of symptoms didn't account for gastrointestinal distress, loss of taste and smell or eye infections that some coronavirus victims would wind up presenting with. Experts were learning new information about the virus in real time, but some say the CDC was slow to adjust.\"The definition of who could be tested was pretty tightly drawn,\" said William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of medicine and longtime CDC adviser. \"The CDC really persisted, from my point of view, considerably too long with that very narrow focus.\" A federal official defended CDC, saying agency officials based their decisions on data they had at the time.Even as it became clear the virus was spreading person-to-person in the US, Redfield said January 30, \"the immediate risk to the American public is low.\"Meantime, flights began arriving in the US, evacuating Americans from China. An outbreak emerged at a nursing home near Seattle, killing dozens of people associated with the facility. And the US began bringing home Americans stranded on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which had been ravaged by the coronavirus.\"It was just sad,\" Jeffrey Engel, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists said, reflecting back on the initial testing failures in February. \"I'm thinking if we had had that testing capacity that we had all hoped for two weeks earlier and shown community transmission, say in Seattle, we would have saved lives in that nursing home. I mean that's possible.\"So far, more than 40,000 have died from the coronavirus in the US, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\"This invisible enemy is tough and it's smart and it's vicious,\" Trump said Friday. Drone pictures show bodies being buried on New York's Hart Island.  REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo'We did a lot'Some health officials said there was almost certainly going to be a shortage of testing, even if the CDC hadn't stumbled so severely at the outset.\"There's quite a bit of discussion of, 'oh we missed the boat on being able to do any kind of containment,\" said Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. \"I'm afraid we would have been behind on the containment one way or another.\"The US needed to dramatically scale up the workforce surrounding its testing infrastructure, Plescia said, to contact those who are infected and the people they came into contact with. That capacity wasn't available in state and local health departments in February and March, he said.As Trump agitates to reopen the economy, the White House is pushing a variety of strategies to help track the virus. It is setting up surveillance systems -- similar to those used to track flu outbreaks -- to monitor vulnerable communities for coronavirus. And it is aiming to ramp up antibody testing to determine who has already been exposed to the virus.But the White House is buckling under pressure from expectations the President set -- publicly.\"Anybody that wants a test can get a test,\" Trump said in a March visit to the CDC, surprising even some CDC officials.Now Trump is looking to shift the testing burden -- and blame -- to the states, insisting they have enough testing capacity to reopen, even as governors say they're still facing shortages of testing ingredients like swabs and reagents.Republican Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said it's \"absolutely false\" that governors have plenty of tests and aren't doing their jobs. Democratic Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam called Trump's testing capacity claims \"delusional.\"Becker, the health labs CEO, said Saturday that he sees things \"easing up a bit,\" but that daunting challenges remain.For example, he said, his group recently received some 200,000 swabs for testing. The problem, he said, was that they'd requested 2.5 million.\"It's getting brighter,\" Becker said, referring to a light at the end of the tunnel. But, \"I still think we're at least a month away.\"Confronted during a recent White House briefing with the administration's failure to quickly ramp up testing, Trump insisted he and his team had not squandered key weeks in the month of February.When a reporter pressed for details of what had been done, Trump provided none.\"A lot. A lot,\" he said April 13. \"We did a lot.\"On Sunday, Trump turned to Twitter defend his efforts yet again.\"I am right on testing,\" he wrote.CNN's Kaitlan Collins, Bob Ortega, Curt Devine, Drew Griffin, and Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Donald Trump was in his element.      Playing to a cheering crowd at a Detroit-area auto parts plant in January, the president railed against disgraceful Democrats, bad trade deals and the dishonest media as he touted his record of creating jobs \"like you have never seen before.\"The brewing coronavirus crisis merited only a brief mention at the end of his speech. He wanted to assure his audience that his administration had it \"very well under control.\"\"We think it's going to have a very good ending,\" Trump said.Since then, an employee at the plant tested positive for coronavirus. Afterward, the plant ceased production, leaving its hourly workforce to collect unemployment. The company, Dana Inc., which has locations around the globe, has seen its stock price plummet by more than 40% amid fears of the virus' uncontrolled spread.Read MoreAs opposed to a good ending, there is currently no end in sight. Southeastern Michigan, where the plant is located, emerged as a coronavirus hot spot, at one point pushing the state's caseload to among the top in the nation.Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer drew the ire of President Trump, who ridiculed her on Twitter amid the coronavirus crisis.When Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, recently appealed to the federal government for help, Trump took offense at her criticism of the federal response and what he saw as her ingratitude. He lobbed insults, calling her \"Gretchen 'Half' Whitmer\" on Twitter and telling Vice President Mike Pence, the head of the coronavirus task force, \"don't call the woman in Michigan.\" While government officials and public health experts have devoted years to efforts to enhance US preparedness for a pandemic, a key factor went overlooked: a president like Trump.His response to the Covid-19 crisis has been marred by many of the same traits that have characterized his presidency, including a penchant for false statements, deflection of blame, self-aggrandizement and bullying. The president's approach made it more difficult for those around him who scrambled to mount a cohesive response to the pandemic, according to public health experts and other officials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\n\n\n\nThere was no contingency plan for a commander in chief who would deem the threat from Covid-19 \"under control\" when it was anything but. There was no tabletop exercise that simulated a President telling Americans the virus would \"miraculously\" disappear. Nor did anyone anticipate that the millions of Americans who watch Fox News would see the mysterious, rapidly spreading novel coronavirus minimized and politicized for weeks.There was no playbook for dealing with a public health disaster of this magnitude in Trump's America.\"We have chaotic things happening out of the White House without any clear plan, without a comprehensive approach, without clear messaging, and the result is a lot of people are dying...who didn't have to die,\" said Tom Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under President Barack Obama.\"I can't think of any precedent for what's going on,\" Frieden told CNN. \"It's mind-boggling.\"Trump inherited some of the difficulties that plagued the country's early response to the crisis, to be sure. And even his critics acknowledge that no administration is fully prepared for a global pandemic with new challenges arising minute by minute. \"It is hard,\" said Lisa Monaco, who served as Obama's homeland security adviser and is a CNN national security analyst. She led incoming Trump administration officials through a pandemic tabletop exercise during the presidential transition. Though Monaco has also been critical of the Trump administration's response during the pandemic, she added, \"I have sympathy for the ability to answer questions and provide information in real time when the ground is shifting beneath your feet.\"As for Trump, asked to rate his own performance at a press conference last month, he awarded himself a perfect 10.The president doubled down on that assessment during an unorthodox appearance in the White House briefing room Monday evening. Angered by growing criticism of his administration's response, including a New York Times report published over the weekend, Trump used what was supposed to be a coronavirus briefing to play a White House-produced propaganda-like video promoting his efforts.What you need to know about stay-at-home ordersWhat it means: These states have issued stay at home ordersWhat is 'essential'? States have varying standardsTracking the virus: Cases by state in the US\"Everything we did was right,\" he told reporters at one point.\"The truth is President Trump took bold action to protect Americans and unleash the full power of the federal government to curb the spread of the virus, expand testing capacities, and expedite vaccine development when we had no true idea the level of transmission or asymptomatic spread,\" Judd Deere, a White House spokesman said in a statement to CNN. \"The President remains completely focused on the health and safety of the American people and it is because of his bold leadership that we will emerge from this challenge healthy, stronger, and with a prosperous and growing economy.\"This account of how the US struggled to combat the novel coronavirus as it spread across the globe and onto American soil is based on dozens of interviews with doctors, scientists, front-line health care providers and current and former government officials.The biggest threatThere had been warnings and hand-wringing at the highest levels for years.Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates told a TED Talk audience in 2015 that in his mind, a pandemic virus had replaced nuclear war as the biggest threat to the US. In 2018, Emory University commemorated the 100-year anniversary of the 1918 flu pandemic, estimated to have killed at least 50 million people worldwide, and explored whether and how it could happen again. Johns Hopkins University conducted a live-action simulation dealing with a similar threat designed to show that preparing ahead of time was the only answer -- that responding as it unfolded was untenable.Microsoft founder Bill Gates warned in 2015 that the US was not prepared for a pandemic.And just last year, the Trump administration ran its own exercise dubbed Crimson Contagion. Among the lessons learned: \"The US lacks sufficient domestic manufacturing capacity and/or raw materials for almost all pandemic influenza medical countermeasures,\" Dr. Robert Kadlec, the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services, told a House panel in December 2019. Months before that, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar told a biodefense conference: \"The thing that people ask: 'What keeps you most up at night in the biodefense world?' Pandemic flu, of course.\"The threat becomes realIn late December, the feared threat of the kind that had been so analyzed and so trained for suddenly became real. News began to trickle out of China about a cluster of acute respiratory illness cases seemingly linked to a seafood and animal market in the city of Wuhan.\"Everyone in this area of public health knew it was coming,\" said Rebecca Katz, the director for the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University Medical Center. \"It was sobering, and we were scared.\"Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar\u00a0(L) and Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health Anthony Fauci\u00a0speak before President Donald Trump arrives for a press conference on the coronavirus.Azar, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, and other top health officials quickly began convening daily meetings in January on the coronavirus threat, sources told CNN. By late January, the National Security Council also began holding daily coronavirus meetings at the White House, said one person familiar with their discussions. For weeks, they were primarily focused on ways to prevent anyone infected or exposed to the disease -- including American citizens -- from traveling to the US.At the same time, intelligence reports shared with the White House and Capitol Hill noted the threat of the coronavirus and warned that China was minimizing its impact.Still, aides struggled to convey how serious the threat was in a way that would break through with the president, who was freshly impeached and on trial in the Senate.When Azar was finally able to press the issue with Trump in January, the President appeared preoccupied, sources said. Rather than engage on the coronavirus, Trump lobbed questions at his HHS secretary about the sale of flavored vaping products. As January drew to a close, the CDC's top respiratory disease doctor said the agency was actively investigating the disconcerting possibility the virus could be spread by people not yet showing any symptoms.As Americans, Dr. Nancy Messonnier cautioned, \"we need to be preparing as if this is a pandemic.\"An administration official insisted Trump took the virus seriously from the start, noting that Trump created a task force in late January and was in touch with governors across the country.But that wasn't evident from the President's public remarks. Just four days after Messonnier warned of a possible pandemic, Trump told the Michigan autoworkers he believed everything was under control.It would not be the last time his assessment would strike a different tone than the experts whose duty it was to inform him.Viruses don't respect bordersIf there's one staple of modern pandemic preparedness plans, perhaps it is this: Viruses don't respect borders. That same warning was included in the Trump administration's own national biodefense strategy.\"Infectious diseases travel without visas and cross borders indiscriminately; infected travelers may not manifest any symptoms,\" it states.But the Trump administration's first response, in late January, was to bar foreigners who visited China from entering the US. It bought the Trump administration time, but it was the only significant step the administration would take to try to contain the virus for at least a month. One former administration official said there was no one left at the National Security Council who could \"viscerally understand\" the public health threat the virus posed.A plane carrying American passengers released from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan arrives at Travis Air Force Base in California on Feb. 16, 2020. Within days, Americans evacuated from China would arrive at Travis Air Force Base in California.Even then there were signs of trouble with the federal response.Quarantined victims were welcomed by emergency response teams that had been equipped with baby wipes and construction worker-style paper dust masks. Those emergency workers then carried on with their normal lives, visiting restaurants, coffee shops and tourist attractions.\"They're spraying down streets with bleach in China,\" one first responder told CNN. \"We would go straight from quarantine to Starbucks.\"As the CDC began distributing test kits to track the virus's potential spread, Trump continued with his optimistic outlook.It \"looks like, by April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away,\" he proclaimed at a political rally in New Hampshire on Feb. 10.Days later, the CDC acknowledged some problems with the tests it had distributed that would effectively leave health officials blind to the extent of Covid-19's spread across the US. The administration would continue to struggle for months to scale up testing. Trump saw no need to wait for widespread testing to issue his own assessment.\"The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA,\" he tweeted Feb. 24. \"Stock Market starting to look very good to me!\" he added.That same day, the Dow Jones plunged more than 1,000 points amid news about coronavirus cases surging in Italy and South Korea.\n\n'Supply chain concerns'For most of February, the Trump administration publicly downplayed the threat of the virus to American citizens, treating it mainly as a problem to wall off from the US. By then cases of the coronavirus had been circulating in the country for at least a month.In a Feb. 7 statement, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo touted the State Department's efforts to aid China's battle with the coronavirus, noting the department helped deliver \"nearly 17.8 tons of donated medical supplies to the Chinese people, including masks, gowns, gauze, respirators, and other vital materials.\"At that point, there were already scattered news reports about potential strains to the global supply chain and concerns that people were beginning to hoard medical-grade masks, potentially making it more difficult for health care workers to obtain them. Over at HHS, Kadlec -- the same official who had previously warned Congress about shortages during a pandemic -- had already begun discussing when and how to begin using the Defense Production Act, a source said.Within weeks, it was clear the US would face dire shortages of its own.Bodies are moved to a refrigeration truck serving as a temporary morgue at Wyckoff Hospital in Brooklyn on April 6, 2020 in New York. On Feb. 20, emails from officials with the CDC were landing in inboxes of public health departments across the country with an ominous instruction suggesting a growing sense of urgency.The agency acknowledged \"supply chain concerns\" related to the Covid-19 response and urged recipients to hang onto any personal protective gear they may have, even if it is \"past its intended shelf life,\" according to one of the thousands of emails obtained by CNN under public records act requests.It was around this same time that Carter Mecher, a senior medical adviser to the Department of Veterans Affairs, offered a bleak assessment about the path ahead.\"We should plan assuming we won't have enough PPE (personal protective equipment) \u2014 so need to change the battlefield and how we envision or even define the front lines,\" he wrote in an email obtained by CNN to a group of public health experts who had worked on pandemic issues going back to the George W. Bush administration.One public health expert on the email chain described it as something of a shadow campaign to convince administration officials to respond more urgently.The discussion included the need to quickly implement school and business closures, based on data on the outbreak coming from China and the Diamond Princess cruise ship.Included in the string of messages were officials from Health and Human Services, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Army and the Department of Agriculture.\"One of the things that we were hoping is people were watching our conversations,\" the participant said.  \"We weren't trying to change things from the top down. All we could do is we were influencing friends and colleagues we have known a long time.\"By late March, the State Department was fielding questions about whether it had been a mistake to ship critical medical supplies to China.Those medical supplies were \"from private donors, so it wasn't from the US Government per se,\" said Jim Richardson, the director of US Foreign Assistance Resources at the State Department.The decision to keep critical medical supplies on US soil didn't come from the coronavirus task force until late March, when severe shortages were already apparent in the US, administration officials said. By early April, the US was buying personal protective equipment and ventilators from Russia, facilitated by the State Department.'This could be bad'Over at the CDC, Messonnier had been delivering stark warnings about the virus.In a briefing on Feb. 25, she told reporters, \"We are asking the American public to work with us to prepare in the expectation that this could be bad.\"She added that \"disruption to everyday life may be severe.\"That was the day Messonnier got the President's attention -- and not in a good way, sources said. National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases Director Nancy Messonnier struck a cautionary tone about the coronavirus beginning in January 2020. The president was wrapping up a swing through India, and he and some of his aides were furious when they saw those comments, sources said, believing Messonnier was overinflating the threat of Covid-19.In a separate briefing on Feb. 25, Azar attempted what some within the CDC saw as an effort to clean up Messonnier's comments. He said she was simply trying to be transparent about potential steps that might be necessary. \"Might,\" Azar said. \"Not will. We cannot make predictions with any degree of certainty about how a virus will spread or what will happen.\" HHS did not respond to requests for comment.When Trump returned from India the next day, he appeared in the briefing room to offer reassurances rather than warnings. \"It's a little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for. And we'll essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner,\" Trump said of the coronavirus that was already spreading like wildfire across the globe. \"We're ready for it. We're really prepared.\"Messonnier would soon disappear from public coronavirus briefings, though a CDC spokesman insisted, \"Dr. Messonnier continues to contribute to the response and is a vital asset to the agency.\" A senior CDC official directly involved in the agency's coronavirus response said, \"giving the science behind something shouldn't make you a political target, but she was.\" The same official was similarly dismayed when the president toured the CDC in early March and proclaimed, apparently without warning, \"anybody that wants a test can get a test. That's what the bottom line is.\"That came as news to those directly involved in the process at the CDC, the source said.'They're scaring the living hell out of people'As is often the case, Fox News and Trump were in lockstep.The visual graphic behind Fox News host Sean Hannity on Feb. 27 must have been reassuring to his millions of viewers, many of them elderly and particularly susceptible to the virus. Under the headline, \"Coronavirus Deaths in the U.S.,\" was a number Hannity wanted his audience to know for context.Fox News host Sean Hannity told viewers in a Feb. 27 broadcast that the coronavirus had yet to kill a single American.A lone zero filled the otherwise blank screen.It was typical of the network's coverage in February and early March. As the pandemic loomed, some network hosts and pundits routinely downplayed the medical nature of the threat and said it was being weaponized by the media and Democrats to attack the President.\"They're scaring the living hell out of people,\" Hannity said during a March 9 broadcast. \"And I see it, again, as like, oh, let's bludgeon Trump with this new hoax.\"Moments later he defended Trump's response.\"No president ever acted faster,\" he said.Tucker Carlson, who hosts a Fox News show that Trump watches regularly, held another view. He was concerned that Trump was not giving Covid-19 the attention it deserved. He traveled to Mar-a-Lago where he personally delivered a message to the president: The virus posed a real threat and it could overwhelm the health care system, sources said.Carlson's warnings continued on air, too. \"The Chinese coronavirus is a major event, it will affect your life and by the way, it is definitely not just the flu,\" Carlson said in a broadcast in early March.In response to questions, a Fox News spokesperson defended the network's coverage.10 out of 10Before Trump fully grasped the threat posed by the novel coronavirus, he understood the danger of bad press, and the Trump administration was getting pummeled.Trump had sidelined Azar from his role leading the coronavirus task force, replacing him with Vice President Mike Pence on Feb. 26. The Federal Reserve had announced an emergency rate cut but investors were still panicked.  And the Trump administration had blindsided European allies with a sudden decision to evacuate American citizens from the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan.So, Trump and his advisers decided on an Oval Office address on March 11 announcing new travel restrictions from Europe. But he botched the details and instead created widespread confusion and sparked panic among Americans abroad.Within a week, the Dow would erase all of its gains since Trump had taken office. \"I think he was pissed that his economy got f----- with,\" one of the President's allies said. \"It took a while to get over that.\"In the days after his Oval Office address, advisers privately pressed Trump to put more faith in his health care officials, like Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, rather than his economic advisers, one adviser said.The message to Trump was: \"This is a war and these are your generals,\" the adviser said.\n\nThey encouraged Trump to view himself as a wartime president, and the framing seemed to appeal to him.Members of the task force also confronted Trump with a disturbing study coming out of Britain. If the US opted to just \"ride it out,\" as some of Trump's economic advisers were recommending, 2.2 million Americans could die during the pandemic. The number was stunning. And it stuck with Trump, the adviser said.By then, Trump had decided he should play a more visible role in the response. Sources said he had noticed New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo getting public praise for his daily televised briefings, which included a slideshow presentation of the horrific data of the day, a projection of what was to come and a stern talking to for New Yorkers.Not one to cede the spotlight, the reality-star-turned-commander-in-chief began appearing at the podium in the White House briefing room, eventually pushing the briefings later in the day so they would get higher viewership on television.When he took the podium on March 16, Trump announced new social distancing guidelines for the nation.It appeared Trump was finally taking the coronavirus seriously. He told the public that \"each and every one of us has a critical role to play in stopping the spread and transmission of the virus.\"Then he rated his response so far as a 10 out of 10. \"I think we've done a great job.\"On Sunday, Fauci, one of Trump's top medical advisers, acknowledged on CNN's \"State of the Union\" that putting social distancing measures in place sooner would have saved some of the more than 20,000 who have died from the virus in the US.\"I mean, obviously, you could logically say that if you had a process that was ongoing and you started mitigation earlier, you could have saved lives,\" Fauci told host Jake Tapper. \"Obviously, no one is going to deny that. But what goes into those decisions is complicated.\"Fauci sought to clarify his remarks shortly before Trump spoke on Monday evening. He explained that he was responding to a \"hypothetical question\" when he said more could have been done to save American lives. Fauci said his response \"was taken as a way that maybe somehow something was at fault here\" and said a remark he made about \"pushback\" to some of his recommendations from within the administration was a poor choice of words.He told reporters Trump accepted a formal recommendation by himself and Dr. Birx to enact a nationwide 15-day mitigation period beginning last month, and to extend it another 30 days when they concluded more time was needed to slow the spread of the virus.Others were bluntly critical of the President.\"Sadly, President Trump has made pretty much all the mistakes you can make,\" said Laura Kahn, a public health expert who has studied leadership challenges during epidemics. \"China had given the Trump administration about two months to prepare for this. They just squandered it by minimizing the severity, downplaying it, making false reassurances.\"Ali Nouri, president of the Federation of American Scientists, called the federal response to date \"grossly inadequate.\"\"We're not letting the science drive the conversation,\" Nouri said. \"We're letting the Dow Jones Industrial Average drive the conversation and that has been a problem and that's why we're playing catch up.\"Frieden, the former CDC director, faulted the administration for \"sidelining\" his former agency.\"What a different world we would live in today if Dr. Messonnier, who is our country's top expert in how to fight this kind of condition of viral pneumonia, had been speaking to us every day, just as frankly, just as accurately, just as honestly, as she did in January and February,\" Frieden said. \"We would have gotten used to the idea, perhaps, that we were going to have to do some drastic things.\"The need to react quickly to an emerging threat, he predicted, will be among the most painful lessons of the Covid-19 crisis.\"If New York City had locked down two days before it did, half the people who died would not have died. Because it was doubling every two days,\" said Frieden, who lives in Brooklyn. \"Speed is incredibly important.\"'A lot of life lost'President Donald Trump speaks during a visit to Dana Incorporated, an auto-manufacturing supplier, on Jan. 30, 2020 in Warren, Michigan. During his speech, Trump touted good job numbers and the strong performance of car companies in the state.Don McMurray has worked for nearly 17 years at that auto parts plant Trump spoke at in Michigan. He said he felt the company didn't do enough to protect its workforce early in the coronavirus outbreak.\"People were getting nervous and so was I,\" McMurray said. A spokesman for Dana, Inc., insisted \"our top priority remains the health and safety of our people.\"Since the plant has closed, management has continued to notify workers of additional coronavirus cases that have popped up among the workforce, McMurray said.The 57-year-old manufacturing technician doesn't know when the plant will reopen and has applied for unemployment benefits. Despite his application going through, he said he still hasn't received a payment. When he calls to check on the status of his claim, he gets messages that the system is overloaded.He remembers the day Trump spoke at the plant, but he doesn't want to get into all of that. He is, however, perplexed about why America's response has been so flat-footed.\"It's been a lot of life lost behind all of this,\" McMurray said. \"I'm just surprised that our country was kind of slow to react to this.\"Kylie Atwood, Nick Valencia, Kaitlan Collins, Jeremy Diamond, Kevin Liptak, Bob Ortega, Vivian Salama, Blake Ellis, Melanie Hicken",

        "content": "Jerusalem (CNN)In Israel, when someone is trying to tread carefully, it is said that they are \"walking between the raindrops\" -- trying not to get wet.  For several weeks now, Israel has been walking between the raindrops as Russia wages war on Ukraine.  On the one hand is Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, who regularly condemns Russia's invasion. Shortly after meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday, Lapid said: \"There is no justification for violating Ukrainian sovereignty and killing innocent civilians.\"  On the other hand is Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. Although he has called for a ceasefire, is sending humanitarian aid and has personally welcomed Ukrainian refugees landing in Israel, he has barely mentioned Russia or its President Vladimir Putin in public speeches.  The reason is complicated and down to a combination of economic, cultural, political and, most importantly, security considerations.  Read MoreIsrael prepares for a wave of immigration that could potentially be the largest it has experienced since the fall of the Soviet Union. @hadas_gold has the story: pic.twitter.com/3k2nvTJ09l\u2014 Connect the World (@CNNConnect) March 7, 2022\n\nAnd while the pressure has been building on Israel internationally and domestically to do more to help Ukraine and push back against Russia, Israel is arguing it should use its unique position as one of the few Western-allied countries that has an open channel of communication with both Ukraine and Russia.   Bennett is in regular contact with both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Putin, attempting to broker negotiations. An observant Jew, he broke Shabbat on Saturday to fly to Moscow for an unannounced meeting with Putin. On Shabbat, the Jewish sabbath, work and the use of electrical objects is forbidden from sunset on Friday to sunset on Saturday for those who observe it. But there's a caveat in Jewish law that a rule can be broken if it saves a life.  How is Israel's relationship with Russia?  Israel and Russia have had a relationship of convenience after re-establishing ties following the end of the Cold War.  Israel has a large Russian-speaking population. From the fall of the Soviet Union until the mid 2000s, more than one million immigrants arrived from the former Soviet Union under Israel's \"Law of Return,\" which allows any Jew, or anyone with at least a Jewish grandparent, to obtain citizenship along with their families.  But beyond cultural connections, what Israel cares most about with Russia is its influence on Iran and its presence in Syria.  Russia is a party to negotiations to revive the 2015 Iranian nuclear agreement, which Israel opposes. Although his trip to Moscow on Saturday was focused on the Ukraine invasion, Bennett brought up Israel's position on the deal as nuclear talks continued in Vienna, according to an Israeli official who spoke with CNN.   But in the more immediate view, Israel considers that its northern border with Syria,  \"for all intents and purposes is a border with Russia,\" in the words of Lapid. \"Because the Russians are there and there is security coordination with the Russians.\"   Israel regularly carries out airstrikes on Iranian targets in Syria, which it regards as critical to prevent the transfer of precision-guided missile technology to Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.   Israel coordinates with the Russians ahead of strikes in Syria and there are concerns that if the relationship with Moscow goes sour, so does Israel's freedom of action in Syria -- something Israel sees as vital for its security.   How is Israel's relationship with Ukraine?  Israel's relationship with Ukraine is personal. As a European democracy with one of the few Jewish heads of state in the world, Israel sees itself as a natural ally.   Ukraine has a large Jewish population and Israel also hosts a large Ukrainian-born population. Economically, Ukraine provides at least 40% of Israel's grain imports and is an important hub of outsourced engineering work for Israel's high-tech industry.   Although some officials have condemned the invasion and Israel is providing humanitarian assistance, like a field hospital, and sending airplanes full of aid, it has stopped short of committing to providing military equipment.   Yevgen Korniychuk, Ukraine's ambassador to Israel, puts on a protective helmet at a press conference on March 7. Ukrainian ambassador to Israel Yevgen Korniychuk has decried Israel's reluctance to provide even defensive equipment. At a press conference in Tel Aviv on Monday, he donned a protective helmet and asked the assembled journalists: \"Please tell me, how [can one] kill with this thing? This is simply not possible. So, I don't know what these people are afraid of.\"  Where do things stand on Israel's mediation attempts?  Even before hostilities began, Ukraine's Zelensky had been asking Israel to host talks in Jerusalem. Bennett brought up the possibility when he met Putin in the western Russian city of Sochi in October, but the Russian president dismissed the discussion, according to an Israeli official.  After the invasion began, Zelensky again requested Israel mediate. The Israelis say they're in regular contact with both the Ukrainians and Russians -- Bennett spoke with Zelensky again on Tuesday afternoon. But speaking on Sunday after his surprise trip to Moscow, Bennett did not sound optimistic.  \"We will continue to assist as needed,\" he said. \"Even if the chance is not great \u2014 as soon as there is even a small opening, and we have access to all sides and the capability \u2014 I see this as our moral obligation to make every effort.\"  Other top Middle East news Iran puts second military satellite into orbit Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) successfully put a second military satellite, the Noor 2, into orbit, the semi-official news agency Tasnim said on Tuesday. Background: The announcement came as talks held in Vienna to revive an agreement restraining Iran's nuclear program have reached a critical stage. Why it matters: Putting a second satellite in space would be a major advance for Iran's military, raising concerns for its rivals about the country's nuclear and missile programs.  UAE envoy says trade deal with Israel will be signed this month The United Arab Emirates and Israel will sign a broad trade and investment pact by the end of the month, the Gulf state's ambassador to Israel tweeted on Wednesday. Background: The UAE and Israel formally established ties in 2020 and the UAE has identified Israel as a future investment partner. Last year, it started a $10 billion fund aimed at strategic sectors in Israel. Why it matters: The deal is the latest in a series of agreements between the two countries following the establishment of diplomatic relations and demonstrates Israel's emergence as an important ally and partner of several Gulf Arab states.  Saudi Arabia to manufacture US patriot missile parts locally  Saudi Arabia signed a memorandum of understanding with defense giant Raytheon Technologies to locally manufacture key parts of the US Patriot missile defense systems, Saudi's state news agency said. Background: Saudi Arabia depends on surface-to-air systems to intercept drones and missiles fired by Iran-allied Houthi rebels from neighboring Yemen. It has also promoted itself as a strategic location to attract military manufacturing. Why it matters: The Saudi military relies heavily on US weaponry, but it is hoping to localize 50% of its military spending by 2030 as its relationship with Washington continues on its unsteady path.  Around the region St. Catherine's Monastery, located in the Sinai in Egypt at the foot of Mount Moses.At the foot of Egypt's historic Mount Sinai, a construction boom near the ancient city of St. Catherine is angering residents and visitors, who for years have been drawn to the site's quiet, nomadic lifestyle. Now, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is completing his \"Great Transfiguration Project\" -- a construction plan launched in 2021 that is aimed at developing the South Sinai governorate to boost its tourism profile. The project is comprised of 14 plans that state-owned media says have been a longstanding demand by investors and residents. Images on social media have for the past year shown bulldozers and cranes digging through the city's rocky mountains -- natural sites that for centuries have been left untouched. Activists have expressed worry over the work, saying it risks endangering local communities.  According to the Bible and the Quran, Mount Sinai is the site where Moses received his Ten Commandments from God, making the area of religious importance to Christianity, Islam and Judaism. Dating as far back as the 6th century, the Monastery of St Catherine and its surroundings are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Residents say they are seeing multi-story buildings coming up, an alien scene in a city where scattered single-level homes define the Bedouin character. \"I feel upset, of course,\" Yasmine Elkashef, a 51-year-old artist who moved to St. Catherine to escape the bustling capital Cairo, told CNN. \"We come to St. Catherine for the authenticity.\" \"We come here for tranquility because there is no pollution and very few residents,\" she added. Sinai Trail: Bedouin bet on Egypt's first long-distance hike\"Egypt is destroying the town of Saint Catherine's in Sinai,\" Mohannad Sabry, a journalist and Sinai researcher, said on Twitter, \"And it calls it development.\" Sabry called on UNSESCO to intervene, saying that while the work will \"take decades to reverse,\" it is not too late. Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said in September that the government has \"taken into consideration the holiness of the site,\" and has been in touch with environmental and antiquity experts throughout the renovation period. The North African country's tourism sector took a painful blow during the Covid-19 pandemic but it has seen some improvement after global restrictions were eased. South Sinai's development is one of many projects aimed at reviving the tourism industry. - By Nadeen Ebrahim, CNN Photo of the day Protesters shout slogans as they march to mark International Women's Day in Istanbul, Turkey, on Tuesday.",

        "content": "Jerusalem (CNN)Israeli officials are denying parts of a report that says they used NSO hacking software Pegasus to spy on civilians -- including leaders of protest movements -- without the required legal permissions.In an article published on Tuesday, business website Calcalist alleged that the NSO Group's Pegasus spyware was used by Israeli police to spy on civilians -- including politicians and leaders of protest movements -- without the required legal permissions.The website did not cite any sources or documents, though the report elicited wide reaction from the government and lawmakers.  Israel's Minister of Public Security Omer Bar-Lev denied that surveillance was done without permission on Tuesday, writing in a tweet, \"Once investigated, there is no practice of wiretapping, or intrusion into devices, by the Israel Police without the approval of a judge.\" Bar-Lev added that he will further investigate and make sure no one is \"cutting corners\" with regard to the use of NSO Group's software.Read MoreCalcalist, which is part of the same media organization as Israel's leading Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, reported on Tuesday Israeli police have used the Pegasus technology in the past to remotely hack into the phones of \"mayors, leaders of political protests against former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former governmental employees, and a person close to a senior politician,\" without the proper court approval. The report did not specifically name any of the alleged targets of the hacking.According to security researchers, Pegasus is capable of remotely infecting mobile phones and eavesdropping on calls or text messages.Such use of technology on Israeli citizens can only be done under court supervision. The Calcalist report says that in the instances it chronicled the surveillance was ordered by \"high-ranking police officers without a court warrant or the supervision of a judge.\"In a lengthy statement on Thursday, Israeli Police Commissioner Yaakov Shabtai said that after they first became aware of the Calcalist report, the police began \"a thorough internal investigation\" that \"did not yield any findings that indicate an alleged deviation from the provisions of the law.\"Shabtai said authorities would ask the newspaper to provide them with more concrete details on the alleged incidents. He added that police would step up review of the allegations, saying he has \"instructed all relevant parties to continue to deepen the examinations, beyond the examinations that have already been done, of all the actions, also with regard to past years.\"\"I assure all citizens of Israel that the police will continue to fulfill its complex and important tasks, and that it will not spare any legal, and only legal, means to thwart a serious crime in the State of Israel,\" Shabtai said.An NSO spokesperson said in a statement that \"we cannot confirm or deny any existing or potential customers. We wish to clarify that the company does not operate the system once (it has been) sold to its governmental customers and it is not involved in any way in the system's operation.\"The spokesperson added that NSO licenses its technology to \"prevent terror and crime\" and that its employees are \"not exposed to customers' targets nor are they privy to the collected data, the ongoing operations or any other investigations by its customers.\"Israeli lawmakers from across the political spectrum condemned the report and called for investigations.Minister of Energy Karine Elharrar, a member of the center-left Yesh Atid party, told Israeli Army Radio that the allegations in the report are \"something that a democratic country cannot allow.\" Member of Parliament Moshe Arbel from the Ultra-Orthodox Shas party told Army Radio \"there is no coalition and opposition. If even half of this report is true, it's a national tragedy.\"On Thursday morning, Minister of the Environmental Protection Tamar Zandberg of the left wing Meretz party, told the 103FM radio station she wants a state-level commission into the allegations.Cybersecurity researchers have documented years of alleged abuse of NSO Group's spyware by governments. The spyware has allegedly been found on the phones of journalists and human rights workers from Mexico to Morocco.The sale of such technology to foreign countries must be approved by Israel's Ministry of Defense. In July, after more reports of the Pegasus software being used by governments to spy on journalist, business executives and human rights activists, Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz said they took the claims seriously and appointed an interministerial team to look into the current process and whether Israeli-made technology was being misused abroad.Apple and Facebook have sued NSO Group for allegedly violating a US anti-hacking law, allegations that the NSO Group denies.In November, the US Commerce Department blacklisted the NSO Group and another spyware firm, Candiru, accusing the companies of providing spyware to foreign governments that \"used these tools to maliciously target\" journalists, embassy workers and activists.",

        "content": "Jerusalem   (CNN)For years, former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called his ongoing corruption trial a \"witch hunt\" and an \"attempted coup.\" Although his denunciations of the case echoed words often heard from his once-close ally Donald Trump, Netanyahu is now deviating from the former US president's methods.   Netanyahu and his team have been discussing a possible plea deal with prosecutors in his corruption case, two sources close to the matter tell CNN.  The negotiations, if fruitful, could be finalized in the next few weeks, according to the sources, and would bring a surprising end to a years-long drama. Depending on the details of any eventual plea deal sentence, Netanyahu could be giving up politics for the next seven years.   Here's what you need to know.Read MoreThe charges  Netanyahu faces charges in three separate cases.  In Case 1000, he is charged with fraud and breach of trust in connection with allegations that he received gifts like cigars and champagne from overseas businessmen.  In Case 2000, he is also charged with fraud and breach of trust and is accused of seeking favorable coverage in one of Israel's top newspapers in exchange for limiting the circulation of one of the paper's main rivals.   In the most serious case, Case 4000, he is charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust for allegedly advancing regulatory benefits worth the equivalent of more than $250 million at the time to his friend Shaul Elovitch, who was the controlling shareholder for the telecommunications company Bezeq. In return, the prosecution says, Elovitch ensured positive coverage of the Prime Minister in an online news site he owned called Walla! News. Elovitch has denied the charges.  The trial began in May of 2020 at the Jerusalem District Court and is in the midst of hearing from witnesses for the prosecution. Moral turpitude  The possible plea deal would likely see the most serious charge of bribery dropped altogether, another charge of fraud and breach of trust watered down (in Case 1000), and one of the three cases completely shelved (Case 2000), according to information provided by the sources who are close to the negotiations.  But the sources say that a key point of disagreement is over the length of community service Netanyahu would receive for pleading guilty to the remaining charges, and whether that sentence carries with it the stain of moral turpitude.   Netanyahu's reign is over for now. He leaves behind a wealthier, more divided Israel and a stalled peace process  If the sentence is longer than three months, then prosecutors can insist on the inclusion of moral turpitude, which would bar the 72-year-old Netanyahu from politics for seven years according to Israeli law. Even if prosecutors choose not to include the moral turpitude label, a future election commission judge could still decide Netanyahu's convictions and sentence barred him from politics for the same seven-year period.  It is different if the sentence is shorter than three months. In this situation there is a loophole according to Israeli law. If Netanyahu faces his sentence as a private citizen, which he could ensure by resigning his seat in parliament, the issue of moral turpitude would not be considered.  Why now?Word of the possible plea deal comes just weeks before Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit is set to end his term on January 31.  Mandelblit was responsible for issuing the indictments against Netanyahu, following lengthy police investigations, and is largely seen as wanting to end his time in office with a successful conviction. The next attorney general will be appointed by the new government, led by Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, and may be much less likely to offer such a plea deal to Netanyahu. But critics -- including hundreds of protesters who gathered outside of Mandelblit's home on Saturday night -- are pushing back against the deal. For them, anything less than a full a trial and sentence carrying with it the label of moral turpitude would be regarded as a failure, given the seriousness of pursuing cases against a serving prime minister.  Political reverberationsWhile at first glance it may seem like Netanyahu's political opponents would be happy to see him take a plea deal in disgrace and leave the political arena, some Israeli analysts say such a move could shake the stability of the current government.  The new government, lead by former Netanyahu chief of staff Bennett, is a hodgepodge of political parties ranging from far-right parties like Bennett's, to the left. It also includes the first Arab party to sit in government in Israel.  The glue that has bound those parties reflects a shared wish to end Netanyahu's time as Israel's longest serving prime minister. And for as long as he has remained in front line politics -- as the leader of the opposition -- it has held together well.   But if he were to exit the stage, it could provide an opening for a new coalition, made-up entirely of right-wing and religious parties, that could topple the current unity government.",

        "content": "Jerusalem (CNN)For the first time in history an Israeli Prime Minister has made an official visit to the United Arab Emirates.Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett met with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed at his private palace in Abu Dhabi on Monday, according to Bennett's office. Their meeting, and a shared lunch, went on two hours longer than the original time allotted. Bennett said afterwards he enjoyed \"meaningful, in-depth and straightforward talks\" about \"the region, our economy and technology.\"The event marks a symbolic historic change in the relations between the two countries, 15 months after they signed a normalization agreement at the White House. In this photo provided by the Israel Government Press Office, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, left, meet Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed at his private palace in Abu Dhabi.Just a few years ago, Israelis were not even allowed to enter the UAE. Now the Prime Minister was welcomed with an official honor guard at the airport.Read MoreAccording to WAM, the Emirates' state-run news agency, the two leaders discussed areas of \"bilateral cooperation,\" such as \"agriculture, food security, renewable energy, advanced technology, health and other vital sectors.\"Bennett had earlier highlighted growing trade ties between his country and the UAE in an interview with WAM. But there was no mention in the agency's write-up of the interview of tensions with Iran.The Israeli leader mentioned cyber security, health, education and aviation as four areas where the two countries were enjoying fruitful trade and investment, WAM wrote.Biden administration has reviewed military options as part of effort to keep Iran from obtaining a nuclear weaponIn a video statement from Abu Dhabi airport as he prepared to leave the Emirates after less than 24 hours on the ground, Bennett said he believed the relationship between the two countries could \"set an example of how we can make peace in the Middle East.\"And in an accompanying statement released by the Prime Minister's Office, it was announced that Crown Prince Bin Zayed had accepted an invitation to visit Israel, though no date for any trip was mentioned.The two leaders spent about two and a half hours in a face-to-face meeting, the statement said, adding that, \"most of the visit dealt with building the connection and personal acquaintance between the leaders, who spoke openly and emphasized their desire to strengthen peace between the two countries and build economic relations.\"Although neither leader mentioned it by name, Iran is top of mind for both countries, a shared security concern. Israel's government sees Iran and its nuclear ambitions as an existential threat, and continues to declare that they are ready to take matters into their own hands to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. They see the Emiratis as an important strategic partner in the face of Iranian aggression.For the Emiratis, the relationship with their neighbor is more nuanced. Last week, a UAE top security official paid a visit to Tehran, meeting with new Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, the first such visit by an Emirati official in five years.A spokesperson for Bennett declined to comment on Israeli media reports that the Prime Minister presented the crown prince with evidence of Iran deploying militias and UAV units, only saying \"they discussed a wide variety of issues.\"Iran condemned Bennett's visit, with the spokesman for the country's Foreign Ministry calling the trip \"detrimental\" during a press conference, according to IRNA, a state-run news outlet.\"These measures are detrimental to security of the region and its prudence's and interests,\" Saeed Khatibzadeh said.\"Welcoming the prime minister of an illegitimate regime which has been the cause, the origin and the agent of insecurity, tension and waging war for over 70 years in the Arab and Islamic countries, will remain, recorded and registered in the memory of Palestinian nation, people of the region and all freedom-lovers in the world,\" he added.CNN's Ramin Mostaghim in Tehran and Valentina DiDonato contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Be'er Sheva, Israel (CNN)In a nondescript office park in the desert town of Be'er Sheva, a \"war room\" filled with screens showing various maps, rolling information, and graphics inform around a dozen or so staffers, manning computers at the central heart of Israel's civilian cyber defense system.So important is their mission that the room where they track cyberattacks 24 hours a day, seven days a week, is itself a bomb shelter -- meaning even if rockets are raining down, their work does not stop.On some of the screens, maps of the world show what look like missiles originating in the United States and Europe heading toward Israel. They're not actual bombs, but instead, indications that a cyberattack, either originating -- or more likely -- being spoofed to look like it's coming from those locations, is targeting Israel's civilian infrastructure.While Israel's military and intelligence services secure its government and military in the cyberworld, Israel's National Cyber Directorate is responsible for coordinating the monitoring and defense of Israel's civilian life.The directorate is lead by Yigal Unna, a veteran of the Israeli Defense Forces' elite 8200 cyber unit and of the Israeli Security Agency. He told CNN in an extensive interview that during the coronavirus pandemic in which many people worked from home, he and his team have seen a sharp increase in attempted cyberattacks.Read MoreWe must defend against the cyber threats facing our global financial systems\"It's not just a day-to-day basis, it's an hourly or minute basis,\" Unna said. \"We witness attacks everywhere. The last year and a half and even before that it's like the world went crazy.\"In October, a ransomware attack hit the Hillel Yaffe hospital in Hadera in Northern Israel, paralyzing its internal IT system. The attack caused staff at times to resort to using pen and paper for patient records, and caused the delay of non-urgent operations for at least two weeks.\u200b \"Most (attacks) comes from criminal elements and individuals trying to find if there's a criminal prospect,\" Unna said. \"The vast majority comes from there because there's good money [to be made] unfortunately.\"Other assaults on Israeli civilian life may originate from state-backed entities with a political motivation. In April 2020, a cyberattack on Israel's water system could have led to incorrect levels of chemicals like chlorine being added to drinking water. Israeli officials publicly attributed to the attack to Iran.\u200bHad it been successful, the attack could have caused widespread fatalities, Unna said, illustrating how cyberwarfare can be just as devastating as bombs and missiles.\"You just need a couple of smart kids with an understanding, [and they can] cause damage worse than Hiroshima ... you can melt down nuclear power plants,\" Unna said.Yigal Unna, Director General of the Israel National Cyber Directorate, speaks to CNN.In late October a hack of an LGBTQ dating site in Israel led to personal details of thousands of users being posted online. That attack is largely being attributed by Israeli media to Iranian-linked criminal hacking group Black Shadow.\u200b \"We see a growing tendency unfortunately... to have a combination of this sort of attack not just for financial purposes but also to embarrass. It's a simple evil or malicious tendency,\" Unna said.The New York Times recently reported that such Iranian-linked attacks on Israeli civilian life are part of a growing shadow cyber war between the two adversaries. The Times, citing unnamed US defense officials, said Israel, in retaliation, was behind a recent retaliatory cyberattack on Iran's fuel distribution system, crippling gas stations in the country for days.\u200b Unna though, was coy when asked about such actions. \"Of course we know who is behind it and we remember ... and we can get even with those who are behind any of these attacks,\" he warned.When asked exactly how Israel \"gets even,\" Unna responded \"in our special measures and means.\"Cyber defense system agents monitor for incoming cyber attacks in Be'er Sheva, Israel. \"Israel has all the tools and all the advantages not just in cyber but in all other aspects that we can use when it is needed,\" he added.Attackers can be anywhere in the world, often masking their true locations and trying to target multiple countries at once. That's why international cooperation is key, Unna says.Global phone hacks expose darker side of Israel's 'startup nation' imageLast month the US and Israel launched a joint task force to combat ransomware, and Unna said that while Israel was already working closely with dozens of countries, it's inevitable there will be even greater international cooperation mirroring intergovernmental military defense alliances like NATO. Even countries like China and Russia will eventually sign on, Unna predicted.\"I think it's inevitable,\" Unna said. \"Eventually all countries, all of these societies will witness the same problems and need to take part in the same solutions.\"Unna has said \"rapid\" is not a strong enough word to describe just how fast, crazy and hectic things are moving in cyberspace. And while he's confident he and his colleagues have the upper hand, it's getting harder to keep up.\"You need to run much faster just to stand where you stood yesterday and if you want to get a little advanced to progress, you have to run even faster,\" he said.",

        "content": "Jerusalem (CNN)Sitting next to the Israeli Foreign Minister in Washington this October, Secretary of State Antony Blinken was clear: The Americans want to re-open their consulate in Jerusalem to serve Palestinians. \"We'll be moving forward with the process of opening a consulate as part of deepening of those ties with the Palestinians,\" Blinken said at the State Department. Less than a month later, Israel's political leadership was also clear: it has no plans to approve such a consulate (the host country must approve any new foreign consulate). Asked by CNN at a press conference Saturday evening about US intentions, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said his government had presented its opinion to the Americans \"clearly and openly.\"  \"There is no room for another American consulate in Jerusalem. We always present our position quietly without drama and we expect it to be understood. Jerusalem is the capital of one state and that's the state of Israel,\" Bennett said, standing alongside Foreign Minister Yair Lapid and Finance Minister Avigdor Liberman. \"I'm sure our American friends and us will continue to collaborate on a long list of big things.\"  Read MoreLapid, who sat next to Blinken as he made those comments in Washington last month, echoed Bennett's sentiments, adding that if the Americans want to open a consulate for Palestinians in Ramallah, they would be welcome to do so.    \"As for the (US) consulate, as we both said it is not about politics and political stability. It is the State of Israel refusing in principle that a consulate be opened in Jerusalem,\" Lapid said. Former President Donald Trump folded the consulate in 2019, merging it into the new American embassy in Jerusalem after moving it from Tel Aviv when the United States recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital. For many Palestinians, an American consulate in Jerusalem is a precursor to what they hope will one day be an American Embassy in East Jerusalem, capital of a potential future state of Palestine. Sheikh Jarrah families facing threat of forced eviction reject Israeli high court proposal The Americans have been seen as largely holding off from major confrontations with Israel over issues like the consulate or the expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank, as a way to help shore up the stability of the coalition government. Stitched together from a diverse group of eight parties representing a broad spectrum of ideologies, the government came to power in June agreeing on few subjects except a desire to oust former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after 12 years in power. Passing a new state budget at the end of last week -- which had not been accomplished since 2018 leading to Israel's record four elections in two years -- puts the government on much more stable ground (because failure to do so by November 14 would have triggered new elections). Now some world partners, including European diplomats like Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney, have made it clear that with the new government now looking more secure, it is time to start pushing Israel harder on issues related to the Palestinians.  \"I think that both the EU and the US quite frankly have been cautious in terms of any criticism of this new Israeli government because it is a fragile government,\" Coveney told CNN's Becky Anderson on Thursday. But with the budget passed, and Israel's government looking set, \"both Washington as well as the European Union needs to now focus on their relationship with this new Israeli government, and make it very clear to them that if we are serious about delivering a peace process together, well, then expanding settlements not only is illegal, but it is also unacceptable to the international community,\" he added. Hussein Al Sheikh, the Palestinian Authority's head of Civil Affairs, said in a tweet on Sunday that Bennett's statements about the consulate in Jerusalem represent a \"challenge from the Israeli government to the #Biden administration,\" seeing as it had \"already announced repeatedly its decision to open the US Consulate in East Jerusalem!!!\"  While the new Israeli government's mantra in its relations with the United States has been \"no drama,\" especially when it comes to a possible return to the Iran nuclear deal, the Biden administration has openly criticized the Israeli government recently over issues related to the Palestinians. A recent announcement by Israel to green light thousands of new Israeli housing units in the West Bank, was criticized by the State Department, whose spokesperson Ned Price called it \"completely inconsistent with efforts to lower tensions and to ensure calm.\" Israeli minister who couldn't attend COP26 due to wheelchair access issue accepts UK leader's apologyIsrael's move to label six Palestinian NGOs as terrorist organizations, accusing them of working with the designated terrorist group Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, also drew some sharp words from the Europeans and Americans. \"We believe respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, and a strong civil society are critically important for responsible and responsive governance,\" State Department spokesperson Ned Price said at the time. But when asked on Saturday if his government was headed toward a confrontation and increased tensions with the Americans, now that the budget had passed, Bennett simply said, \"No.\" \"There is so much more we agree upon with American friends that we disagree upon,\" the Prime Minister said, adding \" I am sure our American friends and us will continue to collaborate on a long list of big things.\"",

Huge, black-fringed table lamps towered over the curious selection of guests -- including NFL star Peyton Manning and FIFA President Gianni Infantino -- at one of several open bars.  Former Israeli Prime minister  Benjamin Netanyahu speaking in Jerusalem on Monday.The whole event had an \"Alice in Wonderland\" feel, as if those present had tumbled through the looking glass and into an alternate reality where Donald Trump was still President of the United States and Benjamin Netanyahu was still Prime Minister of Israel. Read MoreIn theory, this was a launch party for the Friedman Center for Peace Through Strength, an organization founded by the former US Ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, which seeks to advance the Abraham Accords -- the September 2020 deal, brokered by the US, to normalize relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco.In practice, it felt like a Trump reunion, and a campaign event for Pompeo, who received an award recognizing his work on the Abraham Accords, while assiduously avoiding reporters. Many attendees wished out loud that Pompeo would run for US President in 2024 -- something he is reportedly considering, if Trump doesn't run again. Israeli legislator Ofir Akunis (first from left) presents Jared Kushner with a gift as Ivanka Trump, Benjamin Netanyahu and Sara Netanyahu look on.\"We need to order the Pompeo wine!\" said a diplomat's wife at the bar, on learning that some of the drinks on offer were from the Psagot winery, located in an Israeli settlement in the West Bank that named one of its reds after Pompeo last year. Others were even more explicit. \"Time ran out on the Trump administration, and we saw some of your achievements backslide, but hopefully President Pompeo will continue that path,\" billionaire philanthropist Sylvan Adams, a co-chair of the event, said -- to huge applause -- before adding that he thought Pompeo and the Abraham Accords architects would have been a \"much more deserving\" winner of this year's Nobel Peace Prize.READ: Full text of the Abraham Accords and agreements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates/BahrainThe US and Israel's current leaders, President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, may as well not have existed. Just one serving member of the Israeli cabinet -- Interior Minister Ayelet Shaked -- appeared to be in attendance. In a brief interview with CNN at the event, Friedman said he had stayed in close touch with the Trump administration alumni who flew out for the event and that it hadn't been difficult to get them to make the long journey to Israel. Kushner and Trump arrived at 4am on Monday and left the same evening. \"I love all these people: Jared, Ivanka, Mnuchin, Pompeo; We worked very closely together, we really liked each other -- which is unusual, by the way, for administrations in politics -- and it's just good to see everyone here in Jerusalem,\" he said. Two Gulf nations recognized Israel at the White House. Here's what's in it for all sidesEarlier in the day at the Israeli parliament Kushner, Trump, Netanyahu and others had attended the launch of the Abraham Accord caucus. The caucus, made up of more than 100 members of parliament, aims to work on measures that expand the Abraham Accords.And while the evening's festivities appeared to be a toast to the Trump administration, the Knesset event had the feel of a Netanyahu campaign rally. Almost every time the former Israeli PM's name was mentioned, parts of the audience broke out into applause. The same could not be said whenever Biden or Bennett's names came up. When Netanyahu arrived -- halfway through the event -- with wife Sara in tow, about a quarter of the audience gave a standing ovation, despite the fact that Morocco's Ambassador to Israel was mid-speech at the time. The most alarming Trump rally yetDuring his own address Netanyahu feted himself, quoting passages from his book and old speeches that he said perfectly laid out how peace with Arab nations could be achieved. Hailing the work carried out by the Trump administration to get such deals done, Netanyahu said he believed he and Kushner, along with the rest of Trump's team, had \"changed history.\" Just a few hours later Netanyahu, who appears to have taken a page out of the former president's playbook on how to treat your successor, lambasted Bennett from the Knesset stage, saying he was \"not a real prime minister.\" For both Netanyahu and the Trump crew, this was a day spent relishing past glories, looking back to what had been and forward -- perhaps -- to what might come again.",

Bennett warned that all those over the age of 60 take extreme caution until they get their third dose, including not being in crowded places, and only seeing their grandchildren outside and masked.  Israel is facing a new wave of infections, with 3,430 testing positive on Wednesday according to the Israeli Ministry of Health, while 250 people are listed as in serious condition. Two weeks ago, that figure stood at 62. Despite the rise in cases and hospitalizations, experts say it is at a lower percentage of positive cases than in previous waves, which experts have attributed to Israel's high vaccination rate. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett accompanies his mother for her booster shot in Haifa on Tuesday. Read MoreLast week the Israeli government authorized a third booster shot for anyone over the age of 60 who received their second dose more than five months ago. According to the main health services organizations, more than 262,500 eligible Israelis had received the booster shot. The government decided to start administering doses after data suggested vaccine efficacy against preventing infection wanes significantly over time, although it still offers good protection against serious illness. As a result of the rising level of infections, Israel's government has tightened up coronavirus restrictions, announcing a raft of new countries -- including the United States, Italy and France -- from which travelers are required to quarantine upon arrival in Israel, no matter their vaccination status. Following a meeting Tuesday evening of the coronavirus cabinet, the government announced the Green Pass system would be extended to include gatherings of fewer than one hundred people and regardless of age.  Half of civil servants working in government ministries are expected to work from home, and private sector employers are \"recommended\" to move back to a work-from-home structure. But despite the tightening, the new government is still trying to avoid the reintroduction of strict lockdown-type measures. Even so, it says the risks are growing.  An Israeli woman receives a third coronavirus vaccine at a senior center in Jerusalem on Wednesday.Health Ministry Director General Prof. Nachman Ash said in an interview with Army Radio on Thursday that though he would not impose a lockdown right now, \"the reality could make it a necessary step\" at some point in the future. \"We have started a third vaccination campaign to reduce the serious cases, and if we see a decrease it could prevent or delay more difficult steps,\" he said.A government statement on Tuesday warned people to avoid crowds and get vaccinated immediately: \"Otherwise, there will be no choice but to impose more severe restrictions, including closure.\"In that vein, Israelis were also told to \"stop shaking hands, stop embracing and kissing and avoid any gathering in a closed space that is not necessary.\" Last month Israel completely prohibited people from coming to Israel from Argentina, Belarus, Brazil, Cyprus, Georgia, Great Britain, India, Kyrgyzstan, Mexico, Russia, Spain, South Africa, Turkey and Uzbekistan unless they obtain special permission from Israeli authorities.",

Cumberbatch's response was to a question about why he thought the period film was an important tale to tell now and came days after Elliot, a long time staple in Western films, said in an interview on \"WTF With Marc Maron\" that the film was not a true Western. \"You want to talk about that piece of s---?\" Elliott said. \"That's what all these f---ing cowboys in that movie looked like. They're all running around in chaps and no shirts, there's all these allusions to homosexuality throughout the f---ing movie.\"Read MoreElliot received backlash for his comments but has not responded since the interview. CNN previously reached out to \"Power of the Dog\" director Jane Campion, Netflix and GLAAD for comment. Cumberbatch, who did not refer to Elliot by name and said he had not heard the comments for himself, called the remarks \"very odd.\" The actor seemed to take issue with the notion \"that anybody could have anything other than a heteronormative existence because of what they do for a living or where they're born.\" \"I think the more we look under the hood of toxic masculinity and try to discover the root causes of it, the bigger the chance we have of dealing with it when it arises with our children in playgrounds at school, with their friends, in the behavioral patterns we might see in innocent play and just understand how to police that,\" he said. \"Power of the Dog\" stars Kirsten Dunst, Cumberbatch, Jesse Plemons and Kodi Smit-McPhee. It was nominated for 12 Oscars this year including best picture and best director for Campion, who Elliot also had sharp words for. \"She's a brilliant director, I love her previous work, but what the f--- does this woman from down there, New Zealand, know about the American West?\" he said. \"And why the f--- did she shoot this movie in New Zealand and call it Montana and say 'this is the way it was?' That rubbed me the wrong way, pal.\"Elliott made his film debut in 1967's \"The Way West\" and went on to other Westerns such as \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\" His breakout role came in 1985's \"Mask,\" alongside Cher. He's starred in more than 30 films, appeared in over 40 television shows and has lent his voice to countless projects.",

In her experiences meeting Obama, Davis said, she was struck by her \"sense of worth\" and \"sense of belonging.\"  \"[She] seemed like a rooted tree, a rooted oak tree,\" she said. \"There was nothing about her that felt secondary, that she was the woman behind the man. She absolutely seemed like a person who has a sense of self.\" Davis added: \"Barack doesn't make her someone; she was someone from the moment she came out of her mom's womb.\" The stories told on \"The First Lady,\" from executive producers Cathy Schulman (\"Crash\") and Susanne Bier (\"The Undoing\"), span 120 years, but have threads that narratively connect the tales.

Online, host Sukanya Krishnan grills polygamist patriarch Kody Brown about his communication with wife Christine Brown, who announced in November that she was splitting from her husband of 25 years. Kody claims he'd been hearing from other members of the family that Christine had been talking about separating and says the gossip left him feeling like she was \"stabbing me in the back.\" \"Did she ever hear you say, 'I don't want you to leave'?\" Krishnan asks him. \"No,\" he replies.

After all, this is the man who in the same interview admits that he was withholding sex because he thought it would make his wife \"address the rumors that I've been hearing from the kids\" about her possibly leaving him.

To catch up the curious, the interviews come after a season that saw the Brown family -- made up of Kody, his four wives and gaggles of children -- navigating the coronavirus pandemic.With four separate households following their own sets of rules and Kody failing to control the households and people in them to his satisfaction, tension grew among family members and, especially the parents. Christine and Kody's lack of intimacy and their differing feelings on pandemic safety measures have also been points of contention for that couple during the current season. \"Sister Wives\" airs on TLC.

(CNN)And just like that, another chapter of \"Sex and the City\" is over. Simply put, this HBO Max revival \u2014 which was minus one Samantha and added a lot of new faces \u2014 has divided a fandom. (HBO Max, like CNN, is owned by WarnerMedia.)\"And Just Like That...\" was never going to please everyone. That's just how TV goes. But even those who still prefer to forget the existence of the much-panned films couldn't have predicted the pure volume of hot takes and chilly tweets that this show would inspire week after week. The loudest critics of the revival will say they've continued the 10-episode journey in the form of hate watching, tuning in weekly knowing that they'll be bothered by any number of characters or plot points. But I'd argue most have continued because of something stronger \u2014 Sunk Cost Streaming. \"Sex and the City\" loyalists have invested too much time, energy, tears and laughs to just walk away. We're in a committed relationship with Carrie and Co. And because we care, we can't help but wonder until the very end: Can they get it right?Read MoreEveryone's answer will be different, but in the end, here's my take on the best -- and not-so-best -- parts of \"And Just Like That...\": The bestAri Nicole Parker.Wonder(ful) women -- Part of me looks at characters like single realtor Seema Patel (Sarita Choudhury), fabulous Park Avenue mom Lisa Todd Wexley (Nicole Ari Parker) and professor Nya Wallace (Karen Pittman) with such sadness. In the original series, any of these women could have carried the meaty storylines of a main cast member season after season. It's a shame this New York City-set world waited so long to literally and figuratively invite women of color to take a seat at the high top, and having them debut in a season where many other storylines had to be served, I feel they were short-changed. Lisa was introduced in a scene in which she ate Carrie's leftover french fries, and I haven't been able to erase the visual from my mind since. This glamorous gazelle deserves a main course. In fact, I wouldn't mind continuing to see more of any of their journeys.Charlotte York Goldenblatt -- Of all the characters, Charlotte was by far the one who seemed like she'd actually lived through the last decade. Yes, she'd experienced it from her million-dollar home, but that's who she is. Every scene and every line of hers felt ripped from the original show -- none perhaps more so than the scene at Lisa's house when she took a long, impressive dive into the reasons her friend's art collection was an incredible investment, defending Lisa against her mother-in-law's criticisms. It was classic Charlotte -- smart, sweet, supportive when it matters, and yes, Carrie, a little smug. (Supportive Charlotte also shined through in the storyline involving her child's desire to explore their gender identity and be referred to by they/them pronouns.) More than anyone else on the show, Charlotte 2022 came across like that special person in your life who evolves but never changes, in the best way.How it handled grief -- The first episodes of \"And Just Like That...\" were by no means easy to watch. You can debate all day long whether they should have killed Big. (Honestly, considering the off-screen drama, the producers are probably happy they did.) But you can't question that Carrie's grief was portrayed raw and real. It served as a reminder that in the grand scheme of life, although Post-It note breakups sting, they are really just paper cuts compared to real pain. Che Diaz, the concept -- Miranda's love affair with Carrie's podcasting boss will go down in \"SATC\" history as one of the most polarizing storylines in the franchise. On paper, this could have been a real smash of a storyline: Miranda, in a marriage more dead than Big (sorry, Steve), explores a relationship with a bold, non-binary breath of fresh air. Wonderful! The problem, for me, was how they chose to bring this character to life. Which brings me to...The worstSarah Jessica Parker and Cynthia Nixon.Che Diaz, the character -- I'm not in a place to speak on behalf of any community of which I am not a part, so I will refrain from going too deep on some points here. But everything about Rock (Alexa Swinton), Charlotte and Harry's child, was handled with such grace, which is what made Che Diaz, who is nonbinary, an incredibly jarring presence. Che (Sara Ramirez), a self-described narcassist and so-called comedian, is in many ways the kind of toxic figure I've tried to steer my friends away from for a long time. The character triggered my friend radar -- beep, beep, this person sucks, beep, beep, retreat, save friend. When portraying any member of an underrepresented community, perfection is not the expectation, but there's a responsibility to make it count. When you don't see yourself on screen a lot -- where my fellow Latinx at? -- you want to feel like the portrayals mean something. On a platform as big as the \"Sex and the City\" franchise, it's hard to see Che as anything other than a gigantic missed opportunity at best and a giant middle finger at worst. Miranda Hobbes -- Miranda's greatest offense in this revival wasn't living her truth; it was not being truthful. I remember wondering mid-way through what I'd missed in the last 10 years that turned Miranda, the woman who respected a culture enough to learn Arabic before a trip to Abu Dhabi, into a person who doesn't respect her very decent husband enough to tell him the truth about where she's at emotionally. If Charlotte was the character equivalent of finding your favorite pair of designer heels still fit like a glove, Miranda is that pair of boots you find in the back of your closet that over time have become unrecognizable as something that you once liked. When Miranda called Carrie from a cab and declared, \"I'm in a rom-com!,\" I paused the episode to cringe. \"No, Miranda,\" I thought, \"you're in a tragedy.\" She would have been better served as a vehicle for a story about true recovery from alcoholism than ... whatever this was.Brady Hobbes -- I know the subplot about Brady and his girlfriend's boundary-less sex life died off after the first few episodes, but I wish it never existed. It set a terrible tone for the series. Someone should have put this storyline on a Peloton. How they handled Samantha's absence -- We all know Kim Cattrall had no desire to take part in \"And Just Like That...,\" which is a decision its producers had no choice but to respect and work with. They certainly tried their best, but the idea that the women's relationship fell apart over a petty dispute was the hardest pill to swallow. That, and who tells their grieving widow friend that you will talk to them \"soon\" when she asks to speak with you? Not the Samantha I know. Thankfully, we can imagine Carrie and Samantha mending fences in Paris, per the finale. The problem with that? If \"And Just Like That...\" has any plans for yet another chapter, there's no doing it without Samantha. (I won't hold my breath for her return.)The very bestKristin Davis, Sarah Jessica Parker and Cynthia Nixon.Sarah Jessica Parker, Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon -- Before watching every new episode of \"And Just Like That...,\" I felt the same knots in my stomach that I get before getting on a roller coaster or walking down wet stairs in high heels. That doesn't happen if you aren't deeply invested in something. Like it or not, \"Sex and the City\" lovers, you haven't been hate watching -- you've been care watching. And we care because Parker, Davis and Nixon have embodied their characters so fully, so second-naturedly, that each woman and their life feels real. We're angry at Miranda, we wanted Carrie to pick up the phone faster to call an ambulance, we cringed when Charlotte made a shameful mistake at a dinner party. They are incredible talents who've told decades of story through three distinct pairs of eyes, and for that, we can't be anything but grateful. As we've learned, it's crucial to enjoy a ride while it is happening, because it can be over just like that.",

Neighborhood after neighborhood had water up to the rooftops. We saw homes where the water line was in the second story. Cars were still parked in driveways, now covered in water. In the days to follow, it got worse. I saw people being loaded into rescue boats, people dragging what they could carry onto kayaks to get to higher ground. The smell of mildew, river water and food going sour in fridges filled the air. The images reminded me of what I saw on TV during Katrina (I was working in North Louisiana in 2005).

This flood wasn't spinning in the Gulf in the days leading up, with a cone of uncertainty and relentless coverage comparing different weather models. This was plain ole rain. It was a quiet monster that crawled along the Gulf Coast, then sat over South Louisiana dumping more than 30 inches of rain over the weekend. It's a flood I will never forget, my friends and family won't forget, and a storm hundreds of thousands who have had their lives turned upside down will never forget. This no-name storm had impacts that were far reaching and unforgettable.I stood for several days in the middle of different flooded neighborhoods while worried to death about childhood friends, college friends and my family members who live in South Louisiana. In between talking to producers about what they wanted for my next hit, I was trying to contact people I cared about to see if they were OK.

Friends who are now displaced and whose kids no longer have a school.Read MoreMy cousin's co-worker was trapped in his attic. The water came up during the middle of the night while he was sleeping. He woke up to water in his bed. He couldn't swim, so leaving his home wasn't an option. He made his way up to his attic, without his phone or water. A day and a half later co-workers went to check on him, only to find him banging on the roof from inside, desperately trying to get out. He was saved thanks to his co-workers. I met a man who managed to get in his truck and drive through the floodwater honking his horn to wake up his neighbors. These are the stories I'll never forget. I'll never forget walking into an elementary school that took on 5 feet of water. The kids had been in class for only two weeks when the flood happened.

Blizzard-like conditions and widespread wind damage are prominent concerns across the interior of the Northeast. \"All model guidance has surface wave (the storm) rapidly intensifying as it tracks somewhere between the I-95 corridor to Cape Cod, then along or just off the Maine coast as a sub 970 mb low,\" said the National Weather Service in Boston.  Read MoreA 970 millibar low would be equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane. The low will continue to strengthen overnight Saturday, which, in conjunction with very cold air moving into the area, \"will support strong to perhaps damaging winds as the low exits southern New England late Sat into Sat night,\" the weather service said. JUST WATCHEDJust what exactly is a 'bomb cyclone'?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHJust what exactly is a 'bomb cyclone'? 00:52The models are showing the potential for the low-pressure system to intensify rapidly as it moves northward up the Atlantic coast, creating the potential for a bomb cyclone.  The strongest winds are forecast to be off the coast of the Northeast in the Atlantic Ocean, with winds up to 70 mph possible. However, cities including New York City, Boston and Washington, DC, can expect extremely powerful wind gusts ranging from 30 to 50 mph, which raises concerns for falling trees and power outages across the region. Along with powerful winds, parts of New England will see heavy snow with accumulations of 4 to 8 inches possible in upstate New York and northern Pennsylvania. \"There is increasing confidence that precipitation will generally be in the form of all snow across far northern Maine, especially the north Maine woods, where significant snow accumulations will be possible Saturday into Saturday night,\" the weather service in Caribou said.  Get weekly updates from our team of meteorologistsThe combination of significant snowfall in these areas with the strong winds from the bomb cyclone will create the potential for hazardous blowing and drifting snow in the area. This could lead to whiteout conditions and make travel extremely dangerous. Snow totals along the Atlantic coast are forecast to remain low, with only 1 to 3 inches expected. The current forecast is calling for 1/2'' to 1\" of snow across New York City, metro New Jersey, and central and western Long Island,\" the weather service in Upton, New York, said.  Higher elevations of Massachusetts are expected to see 2 to 3 inches, with only a dusting to 1 inch expected near Boston, according to the weather service.  The South will also feel the return of winterThe storm will take aim at the Deep South and Southeast first. Cities including Atlanta, Birmingham, Alabama, and Charleston are expected to see heavy rainfall and possible thunderstorms as the system moves in from Friday night to Saturday morning.  This precipitation will change into a wintry mix in some locations and eventually snow as the cold front causes temperatures to plummet well below average. Snow is forecast to be seen across parts of many Southern states including Alabama and Mississippi. Even Louisiana could see a few flakes mixed in with the rain. \"Currently in the forecast we have a large area of the region mainly eastern Arkansas and west Tennessee with 1 to 2 inches of accumulation for the Friday night into Saturday morning time frame,\" the weather service in Memphis, Tennessee, said. The fast nature of the storm and the well-above-freezing temperatures will keep snow accumulations to a minimum and limit hazards to travel across the mid-South, according to the weather service in Little Rock, Arkansas.  As the system moves out Saturday into Sunday, extreme winter temperatures will grip the eastern US. Keep that winter coat out for a little while longer The start of this week brought widespread warm temperatures across much of the East, with some even setting record high temperatures.  Newark and Central Park both set their highest temperatures on record Monday, reaching 76 degrees and 74 degrees respectively.  But another wave of arctic air following the cold front will bring temperatures to the other end of the spectrum.

Low temperatures across the South are forecast to get down into the teens this weekend, with wind chills around zero degrees in some areas.  There is hope for those ready for more of that spring weather in the near future, as warmer temperatures should return early next week.",

        "content": "A version of this article originally appeared in the weekly weather newsletter, which releases every Monday. You can sign up here to receive these every week and during significant storms.  (CNN)In this day and age, most of us no longer listen for a tornado siren, instead we listen for the screeching noise or buzz of our cellphones when a tornado nears.Even as meteorologists we rely on apps and notifications to warn us when danger strikes. Severe storms threaten 60 million in the US on Monday after tornadoes killed 7 in IowaUnfortunately, this weekend, those notifications were delayed.As deadly tornadoes were carving a path through the state of Iowa on Saturday, the residents in harm's way had no idea their warnings were delayed.The National Weather Service's (NWS) warning system was having technical issues getting warnings to the public, so the NWS office in Des Moines had to scramble to warn the public there were tornadoes.  Read MoreDeadly tornadoes, glitch in warning systemThe severe outbreak was in some ways unusual for the Des Moines area. It is a state which typically gets tornadoes, but ones rated as high as an EF-4 in March is the unusual part. \"We've only had in state history, I believe one EF-4 tornado in March and two or three EF-3s,\" noted Jim Lee, meteorologist for the NWS office in Des Moines. \"So it has happened before. But it's unusual to have them that strong this early.\"As of right now, the region has preliminary reports of six tornadoes across the state of Iowa.The number could go up as meteorologists go out and site survey the damage. One of the tornadoes is believed to be an EF-0, two of them are believed to be EF-1s, two EF-2s and the fifth a possible EF-3. The sixth tornado was an EF-4 that traveled 69.5 miles and was at times 800 yards wide according to the NWS.\u00a0In total, there were around 40 reports of tornadoes on Saturday, mostly across Iowa.People stand among debris as cleanup efforts are underway in Winterset, Iowa, on March 6, 2022, after a tornado tore through an area southwest of town on Saturday. All of this was happening while the NWS experienced a technology glitch, impacting its warning system, causing, at times, nearly a 10-minute delay for some warnings to get out. \"Any delays with the receipt of tornado warnings is serious business as seconds count with a fast moving and violent tornado,\" said Daryl Herzmann, a systems analyst with Iowa State University. He was watching what was happening in real time and was actively tweeting about the ordeal.\"When the local NWS office issues a tornado warning, that warning text needs to travel over a network to a central clearinghouse within the NWS at DC/College Park, MD to then be disseminated to the world,\" Herzmann explained in an email to CNN. \"This network transmission to the central clearinghouse was suffering from that 3-10 minute latency due to a misconfiguration of a network path, impacting nearly all NWS forecast offices.\" He was able to detect the differences by comparing the time stamps in the NWS text and when the product was actually received on his processing software.Still upset over this :(  To reiterate, this was a national NWS issue and not something within the control of NWS Omaha/Des Moines.  I am sick that the local offices had to deal with this and what implications it may have had for those in the path of the tornadoes yesterday. https://t.co/qiZpMMskPL\u2014 daryl herzmann (@akrherz) March 6, 2022\n\nAccording to a statement from the National Weather Service, the Des Moines forecast office was aware of the delay and took the precaution to issue warnings earlier than they normally would have under similar circumstances to compensate and ensure that warnings reached the public in a timely manner.With their main source for alerts falling short, they had to make up for it with any and every other type of communication.\"We utilized like our hotline systems to send out the warnings, phone calls and webinars with partners. We always engage the public on social media. We have real-time chat to talk to media,\" Lee pointed out. \"We have experts and backup systems so that we can make sure that we get the best quality warnings out.\"The NWS noted that NOAA Weather Radio and the Emergency Alert System were activated and broadcast the warnings immediately, with no delay.They were still able to give around an average 20-minute lead time for people to get to safety, which is impressive. \"I can confirm that warning lead time averaged 20 minutes and some of the warnings were delayed in dissemination,\" Susan Buchanan, the Weather Service's director of public affairs, told CNN on Monday morning.Sign up to get a version of this story in your inboxMost broadcast meteorologists use the instant-messenger type website to get warnings first hand from the NWS offices, then relay them to the public. But people solely relying on their cellphones to alert them, were late getting the message because of the NWS network latency, including the EF-4 wedge tornado heading straight for the town of Winterset. A storm chaser captured images of the tornado that hit Winterset, Iowa this weekend.\"Yes, these delays affected warnings for the Madison County tornado(es),\" said Herzmann. \"I don't know though if there is a case of somebody not taking action because they did not get a delayed warning.\"According to an NWS update Monday afternoon: \"The communications delay stemmed from a damaged fiber optic cable that serves our Dallas-Ft. Worth forecast office. The cable outage caused that office to switch from its primary, land-based communication network to a backup satellite-based network that serves every NWS field office. The uptick in messages flowing to the central message handler from NWS Central Region offices due to the severe weather, combined with the performance characteristics of the satellite network in use at a co-located site, slowed down the queue of message transmissions and created a brief backlog across multiple offices.\"NWS systems engineers monitoring the networks worked to rapidly trace the backlog to the Dallas-Ft. Worth office and when that office was removed from the network, warnings began flowing with no delay. The office was kept offline until their primary network was repaired.\"Read some of the other ways to get warnings other than your cellphone.\"Our primary goal now is to immediately implement procedural changes to avoid a repeat. One short-term option under consideration would move to the use of service backup by another forecast office in this type of situation, rather than the satellite-based backup, to prevent message build ups,\" the statement said.Herzmann said the \"NWS is plagued with IT-related outages and failures during high impact weather events. This particular kind of latency issue only happened once before, during Hurricane Ida.\"One day tornadoes, snow the nextBehind the storms this weekend, snow began to fall in the same areas wrecked by tornado damage. In fact, three to six inches fell, making cleanup and recovery efforts difficult. \"Today we're gonna have temperatures kind of hovering in the 20s and 30s all day,\" Lee noted. \"On Tuesday, most of will get up into the 40s, but then later this week, it's actually going to get even colder. Thursday and Friday, we're looking at probably highs in the 20s.\"For much of the country over the weekend, spring was in the air. Since it's technically spring (according to meteorologists), it made sense.But now, we are back to winter this week for much of the country as temperatures take a dive. How cold will it get in your city this week?There is a potent storm system bringing the potential for flooding and more severe storms to a large chunk of the eastern half of the country. Nearly 50 million people are in a Level 2 out of 5 risk for severe storms today, including places like Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, and Atlanta. The main threat will be damaging winds, however a few tornadoes cannot be ruled out. Track the storms here.Read the latest about the storm threat.Nearly 12 million people are under flood watches today through the Ohio Valley. Additional rainfall today will fall on places already saturated, which could result in flooding for places like Louisville, Cincinnati and Columbus. Behind the front, a blast of arctic air will send temperatures into a nose dive. \"Washington, DC set a record high of 78 yesterday and will easily set another record today, topping out in the low 80s,\" reported CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen. \"The strong cold front will drop temperatures by nearly 40 degrees with highs by Wednesday only in the mid-40s in the nation's capital.\"The same theme will run true for much of the east, as temperatures fall dramatically behind the front. Then, a second push of cold air will move in by the end of the week.",

You can sign up here to receive these every week and during significant storms.  (CNN)Spring starts Tuesday, but If you Google the word spring, it responds with March 20.You have NOT gone through a time warp; Tuesday is not March 20. It is March 1. Google isn't wrong, astronomical spring (based on Earth's rotation around the sun) is on the vernal or spring equinox.But in the meteorological world, spring begins March 1.\"Meteorologists and climatologists break the seasons down into groupings of three months based on the annual temperature cycle as well as our calendar,\" the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) explained.The groupings make it much easier to calculate seasonal statistics from the monthly statistics.Read MoreOne thing you may not know is what happens in the winter months can impact what happens in spring to a certain extent.Will a dry winter lead to a dry spring? Or will a cold and snowy winter lead to a cooler spring?Whether weather is warm or cold this springThere is no doubt this winter has been brutal for some. Across the northern tier of the country, an already cold region, temperatures were well below seasonal norms.As I'm writing this and peaking at the week ahead, things look promising if you want warmer temperatures. But so much plays into the forecast, especially when you're forecasting three months out.Jon Gottschalck is chief of the operational prediction branch at NOAA's Climate Prediction Center (CPC). He's one of the experts who will be coming up with the long-range forecast, and to come up with a forecast, you need to look at the past. He noted one of the things standing out to him from the winter was the relentless rain falling across the mid-Mississippi River Valley, resulting in flooding. In the West, lots of rain fell early in the season, but shut off when California was supposed to get its peak rainfall, causing the region to end the season well below normal.  Gottschalck acknowledged how wet or dry a region is currently, could have an impact on the next three months. He explained the soil moisture of a region can play into the temperatures longer term, meaning if an area is very wet, its temperatures could end up a little cooler. By contrast, if an area is exceptionally dry, its temperatures could end up slightly above normal.  \"Lots of surface water, whether it be from any flooding, or just higher rivers, or just soil moisture above normal can tend to keep the temperatures below normal or lower than they would normally be,\" Gottschalck outlined. \"Certain areas that have been quite dry, for example, are going to get a little bit of a bump up, potentially, for above normal temperatures.\" The Climate Prediction Center's precipitation outlook. The brown areas show where conditions will be drier. The green areas show where conditions will be wetter.A case in point: California. We were all optimistic early in the season with all the rainfall they received in December, and then, nothing, proving how quickly things can change for the better or the worse. \"We had all that excitement about drought improvement and there was definitely a lot in the West, early on in December,\" Gottschalck recounted. \"But right now, if you look at the 90-day departures for normal, Northern California and Oregon are considerably below normal the last two months, so that actually trumped.\" Moving forward, California could pick up where it left off, with a continuation of a drier and warmer pattern, as could Texas. \"Texas had one of its hottest Decembers ever,\" Gottschalck reported. \"Those conditions will play some role in the outlook moving forward, because that feedback can produce warmer temperatures.\" Barring a 'miracle,' California snowpack will end the season below averageOne thing to note is the continuation of the La Ni\u00f1a pattern, a phenomenon where cooler-than-normal sea surface temperatures occur in the Pacific near the equator. It impacts weather all over the globe, including an increase in Atlantic hurricanes.  Learn more about La Ni\u00f1a La Ni\u00f1a influenced this winter, including the early season rain events in the West, colder-than-normal temperatures across the north, and warmer-than-normal conditions in the south.  \"The La Ni\u00f1a pattern often produces cold in the Pacific Northwest and along the West Coast, and even into the northern Plains, and that can linger well into March,\" Gottschalck pointed out. \"If that lingers further into March, it may be a colder start more like La Ni\u00f1a in the early part of the spring.\" Gottschalck added we will start to move away from a La Ni\u00f1a pattern later in the spring. Here is the Climate Prediction Center's three-month outlook for temperature. The red areas indicate where it is likely to be warmer than average. The blue shows where it is likely to be cooler.\"As you enter into more neutral conditions, you lose some of your climate reliability, forecasting-wise,\" Gottschalck explained. \"We start to focus a little bit on where we have deficits and or surpluses in snow cover and snow water equivalent and soil moisture in the springtime, because those can feed back to the atmospheric temperature,\" Gottschalck emphasized. Places like the Ohio Valley and Tennessee Valley will likely stay on the cooler side, partly because of all the rain they have received.  And as we know, these outlooks are for the season as a whole. There will be ups and downs, wet periods and dry ones all within the season. But can I just say one more time: Hooray! Spring is right around the corner, no matter when you consider spring to \"officially\" begin!  New weather satellite will launch into orbitArtist rendering of GOES-17 satellite with full disk GeoColor GOES-17 (GOES East) satelliteIronically, on the first day of meteorological spring, March 1, weather nerds (like myself) will rejoice! NOAA will launch a new weather satellite named GOES-18. The satellite will sit more than 22,000 miles above Earth and keep tabs on the western United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Mexico, Central America and the Pacific Ocean. It will have a wide array of instruments and will be able to send back ultra-high-definition images which will greatly improve weather forecasts and computer models we rely on for forecasting.  \"The observations from these satellites are even more critical now, when the US is experiencing a record number of billion-dollar disasters,\" said Pam Sullivan, director of NOAA's GOES-R program, during a news conference. \"Compared to the previous generation, GOES-R satellites deliver 60 times more imagery, and they have a new lightning camera to track severe storms that spawn tornadoes and damaging winds.\" We will be able to watch these storms develop in the Pacific Ocean and track them all the way to the United States. Like atmospheric river events across the West Coast, which is where the West gets the majority of their annual rainfall. However, they can also result in deadly flooding and landslides. Being able to better predict where these systems will set up will protect life and property like we've never seen before. Years ago CNN meteorologist Judson Jones, who writes the weather newsletter with me, went to visit GOES-R and GOES-S before they boxed them up. You can read more about it here. Our science writer Ashley Strickland and author of our amazing science newsletter called Wonder Theory, is following the GOES-T launch closely. You can read more from her here.  The first images from GOES-18 won't be available until next summer, which is a bit of a bummer, since they would really come in handy across the West this week. Deadly flooding and avalanches possibleAn \"extreme\" Level 4 out of 5 atmospheric river is reaching the Pacific Northwest this week, bringing the risk of flooding and avalanches. Flood watches are in place for more than five million people across Idaho, Oregon and Washington, including Seattle. The rain will persist for several days. A combination of warmer temperatures will cause heavy rain in the mountains where there is currently snow. It could result in quick melting and water runoff, leading to dangerous flooding and wet avalanches.  \"Wet\" avalanches typically occur when warm air, sun or rain cause water to drain into the snowpack, in turn decreasing the strength of the snow. The Northwest Avalanche Center issued a stark warning as the risk of avalanches has increased exponentially.  \"Avalanches triggered today could be large enough to bury or kill you. This won't be the day to try to tiptoe around the hazard.\" Read more here.",

        "content": "A version of this article originally appeared in the weekly weather newsletter, which releases every Monday. You can sign up here to receive these every week and during significant storms.  (CNN)Beginning today, a series of winter storms will impact the northern tier of the country, mainly from the northern Plains through the Great Lakes.The Weather Prediction Center (WPC) is describing this as a \"significant winter storm.\" As of this morning, nearly 25 million people are under some sort of winter storm alert. \"A mixture of snow, sleet, and freezing rain may come in two waves to parts of the region,\" said the WPC.  The first will be a smaller wave today with slightly fewer impacts, mainly just a quick shot of snow or a wintry mix. Then, just behind it -- as soon as Tuesday -- another bigger blast will move through the same areas. And it will leave a mark. Yet another system will cross the country later this week.  Read MoreBut first things first. Snow will begin impacting the northern states as early as today. Snow across the northern Plains and Upper Midwest will be heavy, with snowfall rates of one inch per hour at times.  \"Increasing wind may lead to significant blowing and drifting of snow,\" the WPC said. This could lead to near blizzard conditions across this region, including places like Minneapolis. \"Snow rates have reduced visibilities down to 1/2 mile in the heaviest snow, so periods with higher winds could provide occasional blizzard conditions within the band,\" said the National Weather Service (NWS) office in Twin Cities.  This will create dangerous travel conditions and possible airport delays. \"Total snowfall amounts will likely exceed six inches from the Dakotas into the Upper Great Lakes,\" said the WPC. \"More than 12 inches are possible in some areas over the two days.\"  Ice is also possible for some places in southern Michigan and southern Wisconsin. However, the forecast is still a little uncertain exactly where the ice will set up. Hardest hit areas could see as much as a quarter-inch of ice.  There could be sporadic power outages and downed trees because of the icing ... not to mention dangerous road conditions, as even a thin layer of ice and snow can cause travel nightmares and traffic jams. This season, we've already seen people stranded in their cars because of winter storms. In Virginia, people were stuck in their cars for more than 24 hours.  If you must venture out, here are some tips on how to safely drive on ice and snow. Just a quarter-inch of ice can add tremendous weight to power lines, causing stress and damage and, many times, power outages.   For the big cities along the I-95 corridor, this system will bring all rain. The bulk will impact the region on Wednesday, along with winds gusting as high as 35 mph at times. Severe weather and flooding On the south side of the system, warm, moist air will pump into the South from the Gulf of Mexico, providing enough moisture to help create strong storms and flooding. The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) has placed a level two out of five 'slight' risk of severe storms across the southern Plains.  You can track the storms here. Places like Oklahoma City, Dallas, Little Rock and even Memphis could experience strong to severe storms on Monday afternoon and evening. By Tuesday, the threat slides a little farther to the east and includes much of the southern Mississippi Valley. Jackson, Mississippi, and Memphis and Nashville will all need to be on the lookout for severe storms Tuesday.\"In addition to severe storms, heavy rain is also a threat across much of the southern US this week,\" said CNN meteorologist Haley Brink. \"Heavy rainfall rates of 1.5 inches per hour will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding through Tuesday.\" Nearly 70% of the country will drop below freezing this week Behind this system, very cold air will move in. Much of the region will see temperatures drop 40 to 50 degrees below normal. More than 15 million people will experience temperatures below zero this week. Check how cold it will get in your city here. \"Record cold temperatures will be possible today through Thursday across the northern Rockies, northern Plains, and Midwest,\" said Brink. \"High temperatures across the north-central US will be in the single digits today with some locations dropping below zero.\" The cold will stick around for much of the week as well, before we start to see a rebound in temperatures. As the cold air travels down to the South, states along the Gulf Coast will even feel the cold of winter. Parts of Texas could wake up to temperatures below freezing by Wednesday morning. While this will be cold for the South, it's a far cry from the -20 and -30s the Dakotas and Minnesota will wake up to on Wednesday and Thursday mornings.  \"When you factor in the winds, the 'feels like' temperatures across these regions could approach -50 degrees,\" said Brink. \"Frostbite can occur within 10 minutes in these conditions.\" Second winter system late-weekJust as you try to recover from the first system, get ready for the next. With so much cold air in place from the first storm system, there will be plenty of opportunities for snow and ice farther south.  The winter system will get its act together in the Rockies, bringing a quick shot of snow. Then, by Thursday and Friday, it will bring snow to places as far south as Oklahoma and even Texas. However, the heaviest snow will stretch from Kansas to Missouri to Indiana. We could even see major icing in southern Missouri and northern Arkansas, if the forecast models stay consistent.  This system will also have an impact on big cities in the Northeast. By Friday we could see snow in places like Boston, and even a wintry mix in New York City. Speaking of Boston, it could go from highs in the upper 60s on Tuesday, to snow and highs in the low 30s on Thursday.  It's still much too early to fine-tune the details on this one, but this will definitely be something to watch as we get into the latter part of the week.",

And now a new study suggests fires are becoming bigger and stronger at night, the time when firefighters used to be able to gain some ground. \"I personally saw extreme fire behavior at night on the Thomas Fire in Ventura and the Flash Fire near Saint Helena and Calistoga,\" said Chief Jesse Alexander with the Yuba City, California, fire department. He has fought some of the state's largest fires and has seen the intensity of the nighttime fires firsthand. \"Night changes everything,\" Alexander explained. \"Your senses are heightened due to lack of visibility, which makes it difficult to accurately determine fire size,\" adding, \"Fires always look bigger at night.\" In reality, nighttime fires are indeed getting bigger and more intense, making them more difficult to fight.Read MoreNew study finds fires at night becoming more frequent\"Nighttime fires have become more intense and more frequent in recent decades, as hot, dry nights are more commonplace,\" found the study led by the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences' (CIRES) Earth Lab at the University of Colorado Boulder,While the scientists found it to be true across the globe, the Western US seems to be off the charts.\"There are certain places that are definitely seeing a much bigger increase than what the global picture is, and the Western US is one of them,\" Jennifer Balch, lead author on the study, told CNN.Scientists used satellite imagery from and hourly climate data from 81,000 fires around the world to measure the Vapor Pressure Deficit, or VPD. Weather satellites have the ability to sense different wavelengths, and one of those is fire temperature, as seen in a tweet from 2020.The evolution of the Oregon & N.

However, when the VPD is high, \"the air is hot and dry, parched and primed for burning,\" according to the study.\u00a0Scientists found nighttime conditions are becoming much more conducive for the spread of fires, stating \"one full week of additional flammable nights per year in burnable lands across the globe in the last 40 years.  And in the Western US, it increased by more: 11 nights, a 45% increase over the four decades (1979-2020).\" \u00a0The study also used remote sensing and modeling techniques to track the progression of nighttime fires from tens of thousands of fires around the world. They determined \"globally, night fires have become 7.2% more intense from 2003-2020.\"However, in the Western US, the number was four times greater at 28% more intense. Satellite image from NASA during the Camp Fire.\"It is related to the combination of temperature increase in the West plus the drought conditions or how dry it is,\" Balch pointed out.\"Those two factors are playing a significant role in how hot and dry our nights are across the Western US.\" There was also a 36% increase of flammable nighttime hours between 1979 and 2020, while daytime flammable hours increased by 27%. \"The fact that fires are passing from day to night means that we're witnessing more extreme fires in terms of how fast they're moving, how long they're running, and how big they're getting,\" Balch added.Nighttime fires scorching the WestIn fact, we've seen several nighttime fires over recent years, raging out of control and destroying entire towns. The Dixie fire raged through the town of Greenville, California leveling the town in just two hours during the night in early August 2021.JUST WATCHEDVideo shows the town of Greenville, CA leveled by wildfire.ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHVideo shows the town of Greenville, CA leveled by wildfire. 00:54In August 2021, the Caldor fire in California doubled in size, scorching roughly 25,000 acres in a single night.  The Marshall fire near Boulder which destroyed hundreds of homes on New Year's Eve, grew more than 6,000 acres overnight. And the Camp Fire, which destroyed the town of Paradise, California in 2018, at one point was burning an area the size of a football field every second through the overnight hours.\"With climate change, we've seen a more than two degree Fahrenheit increase across the West,\" Balch confirmed. \"What that translates to is fire is very responsive, and it just takes a little bit of warming to get a lot more burning.\"As fires at night become more intense, so does the job for firefighters on the front lines. What it's like fighting fires against the midnight sky \"Usually the night brings a little reprieve from the physical and emotional stress of the day, but when it stays dry, warm and windy overnight the stakes are high, and it's anything but relaxing,\" said Matthew Jeglum, incident meteorologist with NOAA's Western Region.He has seen nighttime fires from the front lines as a firefighter and a meteorologist. California firefighters battle wildfires day and night as homes are threatened nearby.\"Warmer and drier nights can limit the time period when firefighters are able to do burnouts to help control the fire, which are a critical tool in the firefighter's toolbox,\" Jeglum noted. He explained when fire activity is elevated overnight due to dry conditions, it can also prevent firefighters from getting close enough\u00a0to the fire to build a fire line right along the fire's edge. \"They instead build lines that leave unburned fuel between the line and the fire,\" says Jeglum. Fires active overnight also require more personnel to fight the fire, which requires more work in more exhausting conditions.\"Injuries increase based on lack of visibility, harder to identify and isolate hazard trees (trees that fall on you) and fatigue may start to become a factor based upon your physical actions that were performed the previous 16-20 hours,\" Alexander outlined. Jeglum and Alexander both said firefighters many times have fewer resources available at night to help with the fire fight, especially aircraft.\"You won't have aircraft backing you up because in almost all cases they can't fly,\" Jeglum explained. \"You can't see what the smoke column is doing. Situational awareness and communication can be harder. It's a unique experience.\"It is a unique experience which may not seem unique at all in the years ahead. Climate change is fueling wildfiresJUST WATCHEDWhy wildfires are becoming the new normalReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhy wildfires are becoming the new normal 02:19Forty years ago, temperatures would cool more at night and humidity levels would increase, providing relief to firefighters, and \"flammable nights\" were rare, the study recounted. Now, nights are warming faster than days are, amid our changing climate.  \"Traditionally, night was when we could make some progress with building containment lines and perform burning operations to get in front of the fire,\" Alexander recalled. \"On the Glass Fire (2021) we were just trying to catch it at night because it was going so fast.\"Christmas lights adorn a house as fires rage in the background as the Marshall Fire didn't ease during the nighttime hours.2020 saw a record-breaking year in California for acres burned. Eight of the 10 largest fires in California history have occurred during the last five years. In Colorado, all the state's top 20 wildfires have occurred in the last 20 years (since 2001).Four of the top five largest wildfires have occurred in the last three years (2018-2020).\"The fact that firefighters aren't getting a break at night, means that firefighters are fighting fires 24/7,\" said Balch.  It's a grim reality in a new environment of more intense, more frequent nighttime wildfires.",

Then round two will pass through the same region on Thursday, bringing up to an additional 6 inches of snow for some areas.And if snow totals stack up the way models are suggesting, this will be a historic snowstorm.The snow forecast for Fort Wayne, Indiana, is 18 inches. If that happens, it would tie the all-time snowfall record from 1900. \"Toledo could be looking at their biggest snowfall in 100 years,\" said CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller. \"The National Weather Service forecast is for 16 inches, which would rank second behind 20.2 inches in 1900.\"See how much snow and ice is expected for your areaPotential significant ice storm for the SouthModels still aren't agreeing on how much ice will setup with this winter storm, however, here's one possible scenario the American model is suggesting.The storm will the push south and east -- where conditions could turn more icy than snowy with the threat of significant ice accumulation for millions. \"A corridor of heavy ice accumulation (exceeding a quarter of an inch) is likely from Texas through the Ohio Valley,\" said the Weather Prediction Center.From Dallas to Memphis, rain will begin Wednesday evening, then change over to a wintry mix on Thursday. However, impacts from this system could linger especially in the South and mid-South until Saturday or Sunday. \"The primary impact would be ice accumulation that may lead to very dangerous travel Thursday and Friday particularly on high-rise overpasses,\" said the weather service office in Dallas/Fort Worth. \"A quarter-inch or more of ice accumulation on utility lines and trees with winds gusting to 30 mph would likely lead to power outages and tree damage.\"Tuesday Morning Update: Areas north and east of the Metroplex have the greatest potential to see significant impacts from this system.

The wintry mix will eventually turn to all snow for the area on Thursday, which will all fall on a layer of ice -- meaning the snow could 'stick' for several days. The reason for this will be the duration of freezing temperatures. The Dallas metroplex and surrounding around could see up to 3 inches of snow fall on Thursday. \"Dangerous wind chills as low as 5 below zero are forecast Thursday and Friday mornings,\" the weather service office in Dallas/Fort Worth said. \"Those that see significant ice accumulation would likely not rise above freezing until Sunday.\" This will create a dangerous situation, especially for anyone who loses power. Due to the lingering ice and cold temperatures, the Dallas Independent School District has already announced that schools will be closed Thursday and Friday.Here are the latest key messages for a large and significant winter storm that is expected to impact a large portion of the central and northeastern U.S. this week. pic.twitter.com/F2iaX6UgD6\u2014 NWS Weather Prediction Center (@NWSWPC) February 1, 2022\n\nFor much of Tennessee and Kentucky, ice could be a big player with this system, crippling cities and disrupting travel.More than 1,000 flights have already been canceled across the US Wednesday. Southwest, American, United and Delta Air Lines have issued travel waivers for those traveling in the plains and Midwest on Wednesday and Thursday meaning travelers impacted by bad weather can rebook their trips free of charge.Also in the storm's path are air cargo hubs for FedEx in Memphis and UPS in Louisville which could slow shipments through an already burdened supply chain.The weather service office in Memphis said it is \"very concerned with the icing issues\" that this system could bring. \"Looks very messy for the mid-South with several hours of freezing rain and sleet across the area. Some of the totals are downright nasty,\" the weather service said.The forecast for areas around Memphis are anywhere from a tenth of an inch of ice, up to a half inch of ice.\"This is a very conditional situation and any fluctuations in temperature or placement of the arctic front will be the difference in you seeing a very cold rain or a significant ice storm,\" the weather service office in Memphis said. Adding to the misery in Memphis, the area will be dealing with up to 3 inches of rain before the icing sets up. Localized flooding is possible during the rain portion of the event, then conditions will quickly turn to ice, followed by snow.Another shot of winter for the NortheastFrom there, the storm will drape across the Northeast and New England. While millions are still digging out from the winter storm less than a week ago, this one won't even come close to that magnitude. However, it will be another disruption for travel and bring another shot of cold air to the region -- keeping all that snow on the ground even longer. Rain will push into the Northeast and New England on Thursday evening, then a changeover is possible on Friday. Expect a messy day along the Interstate 95 corridor for that region all day on Friday as this cold front pushes through. Confidence is still low on how much winter precipitation will fall for this region, but it does look like areas inland will receive more winter weather than the big cities along the coast. While all of this is subject to change, that prediction is based on the best guidance thus far. What is more certain is the cold air along with this front. Temperatures will fall through the day on Friday, resulting in a cold weekend for millions. \"Temperatures forecast on Friday start out in the lower 30s to lower 40s and by end of the day are forecast to be in the upper 20s to upper 30s,\" said the weather service office in New York City.

Winds in excess of 60 mph are possible through the High Plains as the cold front races through. The winds will cause any fresh snow to be blown around, reducing visibility, especially on the roads. Another hit of winter for the mid-SouthAs the storm system quickly travels south, a wintry weekend will begin. Little Rock, Arkansas, Memphis, Tennessee, and even Jackson, Mississippi, could all see snow. Memphis could be the big winner when it comes to snowfall for this region. It will start as rain and will change over to snow from west to east Saturday night and Sunday morning. \"At this point it is not the question on will it snow, but where the heavy snow bands set up and how much falls,\" said the weather service office in Memphis. \"Models remain inconsistent creating a tricky forecast regarding snow accumulations.\" \ud83d\udea8First Guess Snow Accumulations \ud83d\udea8 Uncertainty remains on the exact track of the winter storm this weekend. There is the potential for a heavier \u2744\ufe0f band to occur somewhere along and north of  I-40. Someone may get the chance to build a \u26c4\ufe0f! #tnwx #arwx #mowx #mswx #midsouthwx pic.twitter.com/pnB28e2MQk\u2014 NWS Memphis (@NWSMemphis) January 13, 2022\n\nWhile most areas in this region will most likely see 2 inches of snow or less, \"There is the potential for a band of 6-8 inches of snow occurring somewhere in the vicinity of northeast Arkansas, the Missouri Bootheel, and west Tennessee,\" said the weather service in Memphis.Once the system gets into middle Tennessee and the Southeast, the uncertainty grows exponentially. As of Thursday morning, the forecast was pointing toward Nashville getting rain to start, then switching to snow Saturday night and into Sunday. \"Although we are unable to know exactly where that will set up and pivot, it is important to let the public and our partners across the region know some areas could have substantially more snow -- greater than 6 inches,\" said the weather service in Nashville. There could be wide ranges in snowfall accumulations for middle Tennessee, and the forecast here may not be fine-tuned until just before the system arrives. Will it be rain, ice or snow for the Southeast?That same fine-tuning of the forecast also goes for Atlanta, where the \"Snowpocalyopse\" of 2014 is still fresh in people's memory. Regardless of previous scary past snowstorms for Atlanta, area residents are actually historically overdue for a good snow -- or any snow for that matter. If Atlanta goes 21 more days without snow, it will be its longest snowless streak on record. This system should bring winter weather to the region, but will it be enough to bring measurable snowfall to Atlanta? With each model run, it's looking less likely that there will be much accumulation inside the city, but the forecast is still changing. The models are still trying to come together and agree on what exactly is going to happen, but they are still disagreeing -- making forecasting this storm more difficult.     While areas around Atlanta, especially the northern suburbs, will see all precipitation types, pinpointing exactly who will get what remains rather tricky. The north Georgia mountains have the best chances for seeing the biggest snowfall totals, while areas closer to Atlanta could see more rain with a little snow mixed in. The uncertainty lies in where that cutoff line will be. \"Warmer temps towards the ATL metro will lend towards all rain with snow possibly mixing in at times,\" said the weather service office in the city. \"However, will have to monitor for light icing, especially in the eastern ATL `burbs.\" We continue to see a strong signal for winter weather here in GA, especially across the north. While snow is possible, it is rare that we don't get to experience all the various frozen precipitation types when winter does decide to pay us a visit.

A crippling ice storm is forecast to developForecast for where ice is most likely to occur.A major icing event could take shape across the Carolinas and Virginia, leaving millions without power and impossible travel conditions. Cities including Raleigh, North Carolina, could be in for more ice than previously expected. \"Over the last 72 hours, the westward trend of the surface low moving farther inland makes a widespread significant icing event appear more and more likely west of I-95,\" the weather service office in Raleigh said. This creates a whole other host of problems. Wherever the freezing rain and sleet falls, there will be instant icing on the roads and bridges. Highways will become nearly impossible to navigate because of slick conditions. What to pack in your car to be ready for winter weatherIt's important for motorists to pay close attention to this ever-changing forecast during the next few days, especially across the Carolinas, to see where the icing will happen and how much of it there will be. We could also see quite a few power outages where the icing sets up -- so make sure you are prepared to be without power. Just half an inch of ice can add 500 pounds to a stretch of power line, and they can be compromised with less than that. A hit of winter from the mid-Atlantic to New EngandAs the system travels north, toward the mid-Atlantic, icing becomes less of an issue and rain and snow become the two major players. However, this still means travel nightmares for Washington, DC, and Baltimore on Sunday and Monday. This comes right on the heels of the winter-related traffic jam just last week in Virginia that stranded some motorists in their cars for more than 24 hours.Potential is increasing for a winter storm Sunday afternoon - Monday morning. Although uncertainty in the details remains, this storm may have a high impact across a large portion of our area.

This doesn't mean DC won't see any snow, just that the heaviest snow will be farther inland. \"We aren`t quite into the range for any snowfall amount forecasts just yet, so still a good bit of time for things to shift one way or the other,\" said the weather service office in Baltimore/DC. In the New York City area, the precipitation is forecast to begin Sunday afternoon. \"For inland areas, there could be a quick dump of heavy snow, especially the farther north and west as one goes,\" said the weather service in New York City. Which areas will see mostly rain and which areas will see mostly snow will be determined by how closely the area of low pressure tracks to the coast. If the low tracks farther west, then most of the big cities will get a cold rain, while interior areas will see snow. If the low tracks farther east -- more offshore, then we could see more accumulating snowfall for the big cities. The highest snowfall totals will remain across interior New England. Gusty winds will accompany the passing of the front, and there could be wind gusts of 35 mph around New York City on Monday afternoon. Windy conditions will reach Boston as well, potentially creating minor coastal flooding. The forecast for the Northeast and New England will be fine-tuned in the days ahead.

        "content": "(CNN)The Republican National Committee on Wednesday filed a lawsuit against the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection, revealing a recent effort by House investigators to unearth information about how the party and the Trump campaign used an email software to spread misinformation about the 2020 election and fuel violence that led to the US Capitol attack.The lawsuit seeks to stop a subpoena for donor and supporter data from the software company Salesforce, and its public disclosure comes on the same day RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel met with the committee. The Trump campaign and Trump's PAC in 2020 also used the software, according to the subpoena. Stephen Miller sues to block January 6 committee's subpoena for his phone recordsThe House select committee issued the Salesforce subpoena on February 23, \"seeking information from Salesforce regarding whether and how the Trump campaign used Salesforce's platform to disseminate false statements about the 2020 election in the weeks leading up to the January 6th attack,\" the subpoena states.While the RNC's court filing says the subpoena is too broad in scope and would cover information on \"vast numbers\" of donors and volunteers stored through the service, the committee says the subpoena is not about collecting information on private donors but about understanding how false claims about the election being stolen fueled Trump supporters to attack the Capitol.Though the committee has faced dozens of lawsuits over subpoenas for the phone records of those close to former President Donald Trump and individuals involved in the events around that day, this may be the most significant lawsuit yet to challenge the subpoenas -- with the national party now opposed in court to the House's pursuits.Read MoreRNC lawsuitAccording to the lawsuit, the subpoena is seeking information from the company that \"would give the Select Committee unprecedented access to the RNC's internal political strategies and to private, personal information regarding its supporters.\" The subpoena directed Salesforce to hand over the requested documents by March 9 and to appear for depositions regarding the documents a week later, the RNC's court filing says. \"It seeks information on vast numbers of Republican donors, volunteers, supporters, and coalition members,\" the filing says. \"All of this information is unquestionably political information of the RNC, without limitation to the events of January 6, and with no apparent nexus to any potential legislative activity. By any measure, the Salesforce Subpoena exceeds the scope of Congress' limited subpoena power.\" In the filing, the RNC says the subpoena violates the Constitution and \"would only serve to chill the RNC's and its supporters' First Amendment rights, while providing their political opponents with an all-access pass to confidential RNC political strategies and the personal information of millions of its supporters.\" Committee responseIn a statement issued Wednesday evening, the committee said the purpose of the subpoena was to learn more about the services used by Trump and the Republican National Committee that amplified false and inflammatory messages about the 2020 election being stolen in the lead up to the attack on the Capitol. \"Between Election Day 2020 and January 6th, the RNC and the Trump campaign solicited donations by pushing false claims that the election was tainted by widespread fraud,\" select committee spokesperson Tim Mulvey said in announcing the subpoena letter.\"The Select Committee issued a subpoena to an email fundraising vendor in order to help investigators understand the impact of false, inflammatory messages in the weeks before January 6th, the flow of funds, and whether contributions were actually directed to the purpose indicated. This action has absolutely nothing to do with getting the private information of voters or donors,\" Mulvey added.The committee points to fundraising emails sent to Trump supporters that directly precede the violent attack on the Capitol. On January 6, 2021, at 1:24 p.m. for example, the panel cites an email from the Trump campaign stating that \"TODAY will be a historic day in our Nation's history\" and encouraging people to donate to \"DEFEND the integrity of this Election.\" The breach of the gates of the Capitol occurred less than 30 minutes later.In its subpoena letter, the panel cites how after the violent attack on the Capitol, Salesforce stated that \"there remains a risk of politically incited violence across the country.\" The panel also references that in light of the risk, Salesforce stated, \"The Republican National Committee has been a long-standing customer, predating the [Trump] Administration, and we have taken action to prevent its use of our services in any way that could lead to violence.\"",

The Committee has a firm legal obligation to negotiate this matter directly with Trump and his attorneys before attempting to coerce and bully me into cooperating with its highly partisan effort.

Navarro responded to the White House counsel in an email saying, \"Mr. Biden is not the president I worked for. Donald Trump is.\"In its subpoena letter to Navarro, the panel said it wants to speak to him because of news reports that suggest he worked with Trump ally and adviser Steve Bannon, among others, to help develop a plan to delay the certification of the 2020 presidential election results.The panel cited lines from Navarro's new book where he calls the plan to delay and change the outcome of the election \"the Green Bay Sweep\" and describes the effort as the \"last, best chance to snatch a stolen election from the Democrats' jaws of deceit.\"Navarro maintains in the book that he was among the \"last three people on God's green earth who wanted to see violence erupt\" on January 6 -- counting himself among the likes of Trump and Bannon.Bannon has been indicted on criminal contempt of Congress charges after refusing to cooperate with the committee. He has pleaded not guilty.Pro-Trump lawyer who boosted election-reversal bid under investigation by the California BarNavarro appeared on Bannon's podcast this week to criticize former Vice President Mike Pence for saying Trump had been wrong to claim Pence had the authority to overturn the 2020 election.During that appearance, Navarro blasted Pence as \"never a pure Trump guy\" and \"the prisoner of Marc Short,\" a longtime Pence confidant and the former vice president's chief of staff, who recently appeared before the House committee.\"Mike, you are dead politically,\" said Navarro.",

        "content": "(CNN)The House select committee investigating last year's US Capitol attack issued subpoenas Tuesday to six different individuals who have ties to the effort to interrupt the certification of the 2020 presidential election. The group represents a wide range of individuals who played a role in a number of different schemes designed to either delay or disrupt the certification of the election results.The committee issued subpoenas to:Cleta Mitchell, a conservative attorney who was directly connected to former President Donald Trump's campaign and was in regular contact with members of Congress promoting false claims of election fraud.Kenneth Chesebro, an attorney that was peddling legal theories to state officials on behalf of the Trump campaign. He also was one of the main proponents of the scheme to introduce a fake slate of electors in key swing states. Katherine Friess, an attorney who was also involved in the efforts to overturn the election results and the committee believes played a role in drafting the executive order to seize voting machines. Friess is currently suing the committee to block them from obtaining her phone records.Kurt Olsen, a lawyer who helped prepare a draft executive order for the Department of Justice to play a role in subverting the election results.Phillip Kline, who helped convene a meeting with Trump and 300 state legislators that led to a number of those state representatives sending a letter to then-Vice President Mike Pence encouraging him to delay the certification of the election.Christina Bobb, a correspondent for the pro-Trump One America News network, who CNN previously reported was involved in the fake elector plot and played a role in drafting an executive order for Trump that would have empowered federal agencies to seize voting machines in a number of states. The committee believes Bobb was part of the \"war room\" at the Willard Hotel on January 6 led by Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani. The committee reveals new threads in these subpoenas about the direct communication between some of these individuals and Trump.Read MoreThe panel says it has documents on file that show Olsen \"had multiple telephone calls\" with Trump on January 6. Olsen was involved in the plan to draft an executive order that would have directed federal agencies to seize voting machines in numerous states that the Trump campaign was contesting. In its subpoena letter to Olsen, the committee also reveals that it has documents that show Olsen contacted various high-level officials at the Department of Justice at the \"direction\" of Trump to discuss filing a last-minute challenge to the election using similar logic to a case that the Supreme Court had already rejected.In its subpoena letter to Mitchell, the panel also says it has documents that show that she too was in contact with Trump in the days leading up to and on January 6.The committee also reveals that it has documents on Mitchell that show she tried to \"prevent, delay, or overturn certification of the popular vote results in several states\" and promoted false claims about the election to members of Congress.The committee discloses in its subpoena letter to Chesebro that it has documents that demonstrate he was involved in efforts that he told the Trump campaign would \"bolster\" the argument for delaying the certification of the election, and specifically made the case for why the election in Wisconsin was \"likely rigged.\"To Kline, the panel unveils in its subpoena letter that it has evidence on file that shows Kline was promoting claims of election fraud directly on behalf of Trump. The committee therefore characterizes the meeting he helped organize between Trump and state officials as \"part of that work.\"According to the panel's subpoena letter to Friess, documents in possession of the committee reveal that Friess was involved in efforts to subpoena voting machines from county election boards, which even included a trip to Michigan where she attempted to obtain voting machine data directly from local officials.In a statement announcing the committee's plans for the subpoenas, the committee's chairman, Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, made note of the panel's interest in the attempts to subvert the process of certifying the election results.\"The six individuals we've subpoenaed today all have knowledge related to those matters and will help the Select Committee better understand all the various strategies employed to potentially affect the outcome of the election,\" Thompson said. \"We expect these witnesses to join the hundreds who have cooperated with the Select Committee as we work to provide the American people with answers about the violence of January 6th and its causes.\"\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Former Vice President Mike Pence was under immense pressure to overturn the 2020 presidential election when fellow Republicans turned to an under-the-radar source for reassurance: his older brother, GOP Rep. Greg Pence.It was late December 2020, and Greg Pence had just received his Covid shot in the Capitol and was seated in the observation room when Republican Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma approached to talk about his younger brother.\"I said 'Hey, just tell Mike when you talk to him, I admire him,' \" Cole told CNN of his conversation with Greg Pence, an Indiana Republican. The congressman responded: \"Well, you don't have to worry about Mike. He's going to do the right thing,\" according to Cole. \"And he's certainly not going to be overturning an election.\"  His prediction turned out to be right: Mike Pence defied the pressure campaign led by then-President Donald Trump and certified the election results, setting off a furor on the right that inspired some rioters to threaten the then-vice president's life as they stormed the US Capitol in a bid to overturn the election.Read MoreA year later, the fury in the fringe element has only grown for the former vice president, but he's not the only one in the crosshairs. Standing right next to him is his brother, a two-term conservative lawmaker and relative newcomer to the political scene. Greg Pence walks a fine line as he tries to carve out his own lane in a GOP still dominated by Trump -- and also to seek reelection at a moment when it's rather hard out there for a Pence. Two candidates have filed to challenge him in the state's May primary, but neither is considered a serious contender.So far, Greg Pence's path falls solidly under the category of loyalty to his brother, despite the fact that he personally objected to certifying Pennsylvania's election results on January 6, 2021. He nevertheless maintains that then-Vice President Pence did not have the power to overturn the election. \"I stand by my brother and will always stand by my brother,\" Pence told CNN. \"I was with him on January 6.\" In fact, that is literally true. He was with the then-vice president in a safe room while the violence at the Capitol was unfolding and their lives were at risk -- a situation that the congressman described as \"surreal.\"How Mike Pence just doomed his 2024 chances\"If you've ever been in a combat situation or life-threatening situation, it all happens very fast and it's surreal. I think my brother's a hero for him to say 'I'm not leaving,' \" added Pence, who has rarely spoken up about his experience that day.Yet even though Pence compares the experience to a combat situation, he stopped short of reacting to the Republican National Committee's characterization of the day as \"legitimate political discourse,\" which has forced Republicans to continue to rehash the day's events and Trump's role in promoting conspiracies and lies of a stolen election. \"I'll let you all keep talking about that,\" Pence said. \"I'll talk about my brother and the job he did gaveling us back in. That's my story, OK? If other people want to interpret things differently, I saw a hero that day. I saw a leader that day. And so I'm always going to stand behind him. In fact, it's difficult to say that your younger brother is your hero, but he is my hero.\"When Greg Pence walks down the hallway, he looks strikingly similar to his younger brother, often causing reporters to do double takes until they realize it is not the former vice president but the Republican congressman from Indiana walking toward them. He was reportedly used as a decoy to throw off the press when his brother was about to be named Trump's running mate. Yet since arriving in Congress, Pence has managed to mostly fly under the radar, maintaining relationships with members from competing factions within his party, staying out of the party's most high-profile skirmishes and gaining the reputation of being more of a \"workhorse than a show horse.\" But with the Republican Party still at odds over how to characterize the violent events of January 6 and in light of the former vice president's latest stunning rebuke that Trump was wrong in insisting that he could have unilaterally overturned the election, Greg Pence's days of relative anonymity could be running out -- especially if his brother decides to run for president in 2024, which means potentially challenging Trump for the party nomination.Not to mention that the former vice president remains a top target for the House select committee investigating January 6 as it zeroes in on its investigation. But even though Pence remains a private conduit to the former vice president and continues to publicly defend him, he also does not want to speak for his brother. \"I'll leave that up to him,\" Pence told CNN, when asked whether his brother should voluntarily appear before the committee. \"Our father always said, 'Climb your own mountain.' So all of us are very different. We don't tell each other what to do.\"An antiques mall owned by US Rep. Greg Pence and his wife is pictured in this 2020 photo. 'More of a workhorse': How Pence operates behind the scenesPence, 65, a former Marine officer and small businessman who owns antique malls, decided to jump into the political arena in 2017, after Trump was already in the White House. The Columbus, Indiana, native occupies the solidly red seat that Mike Pence held for more than a decade.Even as the Pence name remains central to the conversation Republicans are having about the direction of their party, lawmakers on Capitol Hill say that the Pence serving in Congress never uses his last name for leverage. \"It's actually the opposite, which is very refreshing,\" said Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana, a member of GOP leadership. \"Because almost anybody else would use that. Right? But he doesn't. And he almost, like, works against it. Because he's his own man.\"\"He does not go out of his way to self-aggrandize or grandstand,\" added moderate Republican Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota. \"He is more of a workhorse than a show horse.\"He said that when Pence does talk about his brother, \"it's not forced. It's not like he is name dropping.\"Moderate GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska also characterized Pence as more of a behind-the-scenes operator, telling CNN, \"He is not trying to grab a lot of attention even though he could with his last name.\"Part of that likability comes from Pence's ability to balance voting with the faction of his party that remains loyal to Trump while also being loyal to his brother. Pence objected to the certification of the Pennsylvania 2020 election results, and signed on to an amicus brief backing a lawsuit from Texas to the Supreme Court seeking to overturn the results of the election in the states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia. But he doesn't view those actions as at odds with his brother's role in overseeing the election certification process.\"He did his job that night,\" the congressman said. The Indiana lawmaker certainly could use his political standing and connections as a springboard for his political career, especially if Republicans reclaim the House next year. He's also a strong fundraiser, especially for a rank-and-file member: He once earned a shoutout from Trump for his fundraising skills, with the former President joking: \"I know a guy who looks like you.\"But while he's followed in his brother's footsteps by running for Congress, lawmakers aren't certain whether Pence has his eyes on climbing the leadership ladder or launching a bid for higher office one day. \"You don't, you know, talk to Greg Pence and think, 'Oh, aspiration,' \" said Mike Johnson. Yet at the same time, \"people look at him and think, this guy could be a leader.\"If he does harbor any great political ambitions, lawmakers say, he's kept them close to the vest.\"He's certainly very capable,\" Dusty Johnson told CNN. \"I don't know what his ambitions are.\"Pence serves on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, a top panel that has broad jurisdiction over health care, the environment and telecommunications. He is also a member of the GOP's whip team, which is responsible for counting votes and wrangling members.But even though members were not sure if Pence had leadership ambitions, members from across the Republican conference spoke highly of his character. \"He's one of those quiet forces inside the conference that people look to for common sense and steadiness in a crisis,\" Cole said. Even some of the conference's hardliners, who have been critical of the former vice president and continue to falsely suggest he had the power to overturn the election, had nothing but nice things to say about Greg Pence.\"I find him to be very kind, very helpful and a very cheery person, but we don't serve on committees together and we haven't worked on legislation closely together,\" said GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, a staunch Trump ally.\"He is hard working, levelheaded, commonsense. A very good member,\" added GOP Rep. Debbie Lesko of Arizona, who serves with him on the Energy and Commerce Committee.Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas, a member of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, echoed a similar sentiment: \"He is just as nice a guy as you could ever meet.\"Some lawmakers, however, did not have as much to say about him, given his low profile.GOP Rep. Jackie Walorski, who is also from Indiana, did not know how to describe the Pence brothers' relationship.\"I don't have a clue,\" Walorski told CNN, and added, in reference to the former vice president, \"I'm not on necessarily any team of anybody's politically, so I haven't run into him up here.\"CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correctly identify that Rep. Jackie Walorski's comments were in reference to Vice President Mike Pence and his relationship to his brother Greg Pence.",

        "content": "(CNN)Elizabeth Skipper, a freelance copywriter in Cincinnati, has done something that might make a lot of people jealous.She's gone to bed with Idris Elba dozens of times. No, not in the flesh. Skipper drifts off to sleep at night listening to Elba's deep baritone narrating a story via the Calm app on her phone. Not much happens in the story, a leisurely travelogue about the African country of Lesotho which slackens into descriptions of alpine valleys and caves with ancient rock art.But Elba's tale and other glacially paced narratives, most commonly called \"sleep stories,\" have become increasingly popular during the pandemic among people looking to quiet their minds and soothe their jangled nerves at bedtime.\"My brain is a noisy place,\" Skipper says. \"The sleep stories are interesting and dull at the same time, the right combination to distract my brain and convince it to shut up long enough to fall asleep.\"Actor Idris Elba narrates a sleep story about the African country of Lesotho.Read MoreSuch stories -- aural hits of Ambien -- appear on Calm, Headspace and other wellness apps. Listeners tuck themselves into bed, hit play on a story and likely surrender to sleep before the tale is over. But writing one is a tricky balancing act. If a story is too dull, listeners won't forget their troubles. If it's too interesting, they won't fall asleep. \"Writers that we hire underestimate how difficult that is,\" says Chris Advansun, Calm's Head of Sleep Stories.  Successful sleep-story writers, he says, must \"set aside all the tools that you're used to working with -- conflict, tension, antagonism, revelation, twists and turns -- all of these things that are so foundational to traditional storytelling.\"Here's how sleep stories are made -- and why some people say they help steer them toward slumber.They're a new genre of bedtime storyCalm and Headspace, leaders in the increasingly crowded field of mindfulness apps, both began by offering guided meditations, breathing exercises and so on. Listeners typically pay monthly or annual membership fees to access their content.In 2016 staffers at Calm noticed a spike in usage at night and realized their subscribers were using the app to wind down at bedtime. And sleep stories were born. Headspace followed two years later with their version, called sleepcasts.So as we relax on this November night, a beautiful balance of things are happening. Events unfolding at every reach and depth of this planet. At at once, it is both autumn and spring, day and night, dawn and dusk. Clouds are converging and clearing, storms looming and dispersing, temperatures heating and cooling...--from \"Wonder,\" narrated by Matthew McConaughey, on CalmThe app has 4 million paid subscribers and has seen downloads double during the pandemic, a Calm spokesperson says. Headspace also reported a surge in usage over the past year.Most sleep stories take the listener to another world -- Iceland, a remote lighthouse, the African savanna -- where, in the story at least, absolutely nothing dramatic happens. The stories unfold in hushed, intimate tones, almost as if the narrator is whispering in your ear. A typical story is filled with soothing sensory details -- a brush of breeze, the faraway call of a loon, the musty smell of old books -- that place the listener in a setting without overstimulating them. Some have ambient sound effects, such as chirping crickets or the gentle crackling of a campfire.Travelogues are popular themes. So are trains. And cozy cabins. And rain -- lots of rain. \"There aren't high stakes, there aren't big revelations ... they're very gentle stories, and they just gradually wind down and guide the listener off to sleep,\" says Calm's Advansun. \"I think what a sleep story is doing on a very subconscious level is ... replicating that experience that many of us had of being a kid and having a loved one, who we trust so much, tuck us in at night, and read a story. And we're drifting off to that comforting voice.\"Chris Advansun, head of sleep stories for Calm, the wellness app.While Headspace employs anonymous narrators, many of Calm's most popular stories are voiced by celebrities. You can nod off to \"Game of Thrones'\" Jerome Flynn squiring you around Shakespeare's London, Mandy Moore soaring above the clouds in a hot air balloon or LeVar Burton captaining your personal tour of the solar system.One, narrated by Matthew McConaughey, has been streamed more than 11 million times.Called \"Wonder,\" it's about a young girl named Zoe who hears a noise one night at her family's lake house and creeps outside to find her grandpa gazing up at the stars. The story then drifts into plotless musings on the wonders of the universe and the rhythms of the natural world.\"A flamboyance of flamingos is lounging in a lagoon..,\" McConaughey says alliteratively in his soft Texas drawl. \"A kaleidoscope of butterflies is fluttering in a field ...\"The story ends with Zoe climbing back into bed and ... yes, drifting off to sleep.They employ tricks to help you fall asleepMost storytelling has a traditional structure. A conflict is introduced or a quest begins. The main character or characters chart a course of action. The narrative builds to a climax. And at the end, the conflict is resolved.It's usually a dramatic arc. But sleep stories, in Advansun's words, are more of \"a gentle downward slope.\"The same principle applies to how the stories are told. \"As the story progresses, you wind down, and you slow down,\" says Anna Acton, an actress who has narrated more than a dozen stories for Calm. Acton voices the stories in a London recording studio, with a director listening remotely and giving her guidance. Sign up for CNN's SLEEP, BUT BETTER newsletter\"They've done so much research that they know exactly at which point in the story people start to fall asleep. It's very carefully orchestrated,\" she says.\"It all has to do with the pace, really. Instead of keeping people engaged, it's sort of the reverse. It's nothing like I've ever done before. It's difficult, especially being quite animated normally ... if you're lulling somebody off to sleep with a certain tone or a certain delivery, you don't want to do anything where you come back in and engage people.\"The same holds true for Headspace's sleepcasts, which take place in generically titled places such as \"Cabin Porch,\" \"Hushed Theater\" or \"Vineyard Sunset\" -- settings that, according to the company's website, \"evoke feelings of reassurance and safety.\"The fresh air in this desert smells sweet. Its breezes are soft and cool now, carrying the night-blooming perfumes of plants to us. I can smell desert sage blending with the smoky cedar from the campfire. I love to take a big, deep breath of all these smells. It keeps me warm and clears my mind, like a good cup of tea...--from \"Desert Campfire,\" on HeadspaceThe stories unfold without a plot so that Headspace subscribers can begin listening wherever they like and not feel like they missed something.\"We focus on atmosphere first and foremost -- imagine a peaceful, comforting place. What exists in that place? How can we draw on all of the senses to make our listeners feel transported?\" says Brianna LeRose, content director at Headspace. \"It's less about telling a story and more about conjuring images and feelings.\"For that reason, LeRose says, Headspace often hires poets to write its sleepcasts because \"they seem to intuitively get the vibe we're after.\"One, California poet Alexis Aceves Garcia, visits settings with a notepad to capture sensory details that help \"elongate time\" in sleepcasts. For a story called \"Windswept Lighthouse,\" Garcia visited the Cabrillo National Monument near San Diego, studied the flora and fauna of the rocky cliffside and researched the migration patterns of gray whales that passed by each year. \"Each sleepcast is its own world, one outside of time and distraction,\" says Garcia. \"A successful Sleepcast doesn't 'puppeteer' the listener (you do this, you do that) and instead presents the scenery like a floating camera would, fluid and intuitively.\"  Poet Alexis Aceves Garcia has written sleepcasts for Headspace, the wellness app.Language is also key. Writers of sleep stories avoid words like \"spider\" or \"snake\" that could spur a listener's anxieties. Even a seemingly innocuous word like \"airplane\" can be triggering to someone with a fear of flying. Blunt words with sharp consonants, like \"crack\" and \"bolt,\" don't work as well as soothing, lyrical words like \"hush\" and \"whisper.\"\"We call it softening the language,\" says Advansun. \"Because there are certain words that are sort of grating ... it's like a bump in that experience of drifting off to sleep.\"For example, in the original draft of \"Wonder,\" the McConaughey story which Advansun wrote, the little girl had a favorite stuffed animal, a dinosaur named Spike.\"Spike is an obvious name for a stuffed animal. He's got a spiky tail, or whatever,\" Advansun says. \"But that's not sleepy, as we say.\"So Spike, the spiky stuffed dinosaur, became Snug.What listeners say works best for them -- and what doesn'tMost sleep stories last 30 to 45 minutes. Calm's early sleep stories ran about 20 minutes, but over time they've gradually gotten longer.\"We realized that the sleep ritual is a long thing,\" says Advansun, \"and it takes time for folks to get transported out of their anxious thoughts at night.\"But not that much time. Mike Harris, a UK-based editor at Golf Monthly, uses an app on his watch that tracks how fast he falls asleep. If he has a lot on his mind, he will \"very rarely\" make it to the end of a Calm story. But Harris says he's usually out within 10 minutes.\"The calming tone and ... the nature of the story -- slow-paced journeys, especially -- help clear my mind of the things I can tend to ruminate on at bedtime,\" he says.You see nothing but ice in this frozen world. Most remarkable is the color. The glacier is a shade of blue, mimicked by nothing else in nature. Almost like a glowing robin's egg, or turquoise glass. The sunlight reflects on frozen water, so that the colors seem alive, playing a game, blinking and swirling, just below the surface...\n--from \"Iceland's Midnight Sun,\" narrated by Anna Acton, on CalmSkipper, the Cincinnati copywriter, surrenders to sleep even faster.\"I've never made it to the end of a sleep story. And I've tried!\" she says. \"I'd really like to know how a couple of my favorite stories end.\"Both Harris and Skipper say deeper male voices are most successful at putting them to sleep. They've tried female narrators, but the stories didn't have the same narcoleptic effect. (One exception to this pattern might be singer Harry Styles. Some women have complained his Calm sleep story, \"Dream with Me,\" is too distractingly sexy.)When she finds a story she likes, Skipper will doze off to it night after night. She estimates she's gotten into bed with some of her favorites, like Elba's, more than 50 times.But that repetition doesn't work for everybody. Headspace shuffles the structure of its sleepcasts so they are different each time someone listens. The thinking is that when the brain recognizes a narrative it becomes stimulated, keeping the listener awake.\"We're trying to keep people's brains from scanning for a familiar pattern, so we intentionally change parts of the story and shift them around on a nightly basis,\" says Headspace's LeRose. \"It's also a unique challenge in the writing because our chapters can't unfold sequentially.\"The Calm app offers dozens of sleep stories, from travelogues to tales for children.The effect, sort of like ambient noise, works for Katherine McCann of Williamsburg, Virginia, who listens to Headspace's sleepcasts about five nights a week.\"I think the sleep stories work well for me because they don't have a beginning, middle and end. It is just running commentary (on) the surroundings of the scene,\" she says. \"With podcasts or even the TV, I feel the need to stay awake to find out the ending. With a sleep story, I feel it gives me permission to actually shut down.\"Writers and narrators of sleep stories say they enjoy the challenge of setting a scene, creating a mood and transporting listeners to dreamland. But they acknowledge it can feel strange to spend hours crafting something they hope their audience will never hear.\"I gotta say, it took some getting used to to hear people say, \"I love your stories. I never get to the end,'\" Advansun says.But now he takes it as a compliment.",

        "content": "(CNN)Poetry and football. Two words you don't often hear in the same sentence.One is a lyrical, niche art form. The other is a violent, mass-consumed sport. There's something discordant about putting them together, like a mash-up gone wrong or two mismatched people on a bad date. And yet Amanda Gorman, fresh off her stunning appearance at President Biden's inauguration, will recite an original poem today at Super Bowl LV in Tampa. It'll mark the first time poetry has been an official part of America's biggest unofficial holiday. Poetry has no business at a football game, you might say. Football games are for stirring renditions of the national anthem, neck-twisting military flyovers, the unfurling of vast American flags at stadiums packed with cheering fans. Pageantry, not poetry. Poetry, on the other hand, is for Elizabethans, swooning lovers, starving writers and dreamy prep school boys under the spell of Robin Williams. It is traditionally consumed quietly, in a personal pact between poet and reader, without marching bands or Bud Light commercials. Read MoreThe two seem SO different. After all, football is measured in yards, poetry in meters. There's no crying in baseball. And there's no poetry in football. That's the perception, anyway. The perception is wrong.\"At their best, football and poetry both reach sort of a state of grace,\" says Quentin Ring, executive director of Beyond Baroque, a literary arts center in Venice, California, where Gorman took poetry workshops as a teenager. \"When you see somebody like Tom Brady when he's in the zone, it's sublime. And poetry is also something that large numbers of people can be enraptured by.\"Consider:Football and poetry have a history\"Football combines two of the worst things in American life,\" George Will once said. \"It is violence punctuated by committee meetings.\"Poetry, on the other hand, has been called nothing less than \"the history of the human soul.\"But yes, there is poetry in football. There's the graceful arc of a perfectly thrown spiral, the slow-motion ballet of a halfback weaving through tacklers, ESPN's Chris Berman rhapsodizing about \"the frozen tundra of Lambeau Field.\"There's also history.The Baltimore Ravens are named for \"The Raven,\" the famous poem by Edgar Allan Poe, who spent the later part of his life in the city.The Baltimore Ravens are named for an Edgar Allen Poe poem.The climax of the Marx Brothers' 1934 movie \"Horse Feathers\" is a college football game in which Chico calls out plays with rhyming verse. \"Hi diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle,\" he says, \"This time I think we go through the middle.\"And the battle hymn of the Raiders franchise, dating back to their early days in Oakland, is \"The Autumn Wind,\" a poem adapted by Steve Sabol and narrated by NFL Films' John Facenda, whose thunderous baritone earned him a nickname, \"The Voice of God.\" Its last verse goes like this:The Autumn Wind is a raider,Pillaging just for fun.He'll knock you 'round and upside down,And laugh when he's conquered and won.It's not Shakespeare, but Raiders fans still blast the poem from their trucks at tailgates.And speaking of the Bard of Avon ... did you know that William Shakespeare played football? No, not that one. The other one, William V. Shakespeare, who was an All-American halfback at Notre Dame in the 1930s. Among his many colorful nicknames: \"The Merchant of Menace.\" NFL players write poetryCleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett, the first overall pick in the 2017 NFL draft, is 6-foot-4, 272 pounds and hell on opposing quarterbacks. He also loves the poetry of Maya Angelou, and writes poems in his spare time.\"If I'm feeling stress or anxiety, I'll escape into another world. With books, you're going on an adventure, imagining and wondering. Poetry is different,\" he told ESPN. \"When you're a poet, or reading poems, you feel every single word.\"Defensive end Myles Garrett of the Cleveland Browns.Garrett is just one of numerous NFL players who have dabbled in writing verse.Another, Seattle Seahawks receiver Tyler Lockett, wrote a poem, \"Reality vs. Perception,\" about social injustice and the prejudices Black men face in America. It goes, in part:When I look in the mirror, I see more than a Black manBut what do you see, America?An entertainer? An athlete? What else do you see? A gangbanger? A drug dealer? A criminal? A lowlife?Why not a lawyer? Why not a doctor? Why not a son? Why not a father?A video of Lockett and other star NFL players reciting the poem is on the NFL's website.Even Tom Brady has been known to share poetry as a way of getting fired up for a game -- as he did on Instagram before his last Super Bowl appearance two years ago. It must have worked. He won.Poets have written poems about footballBaseball, with its sepia-toned mythology and leisurely rhythms, has long been seen as the more literary sport.  From \"Casey at the Bat\" to John Updike's tribute to Ted Williams at his last home game, writers have waxed poetic about its sun-dappled ballparks, crafty pitchers and heroic batters striving for bursts of glory.Football, not so much. After all, Alfred Lord Tennyson didn't write, \"'Tis better to have played and lost to the Jacksonville Jaguars than never to have played at all.\" Tom Brady of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He likes poetry, too.But there is a vibrant subgenre of football poems by professional poets. Their verses describe graceful young bodies in their prime, touch football games in the street and fans huddled on rickety school bleachers on Friday nights.One, \"football dreams\" by Jaqueline Woodson, begins like this:No one was fasterthan my father on the football field.No one could keep himfrom crossing the line. Thentouching down again.Coaches were watching the way he moved,his easy stride, his long arms reachingup, snatching the ball from its soft pocketsof air.Poetry spoken aloud has a 'physicality'This evening in Tampa, Amanda Gorman will not be reading a poem about football.Instead she will recite an original poem recognizing three honorary captains at the Super Bowl -- a nurse, a teacher and a veteran -- \"who served as leaders in their respective communities during the global pandemic.\"It's just the latest in a flurry of recent triumphs for Gorman, the nation's first-ever youth poet laureate.JUST WATCHEDYouth poet laureate recites her stunning poem at Biden inaugurationReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHYouth poet laureate recites her stunning poem at Biden inauguration 05:32Ring remembers Gorman from her years in the poetry program at Beyond Baroque and was immediately struck by her precocious talent.\"It was pretty clear that she was destined for great things,\" he says. Ring couldn't have imagined those great things would include bringing the ancient art of poetry to America's biggest sports spectacle.But he says the pairing of poetry and football is not the shotgun marriage it may seem. Like football, spoken-word poetry is a communal activity. And like football, its carefully chosen words can land with impact.\"There's a physicality to it,\" he says. \"People can actually feel it when Amanda is reading her poetry.\"Some, watching Gorman tonight, will feel it. Some will shrug and turn back to their chicken wings. But the Super Bowl will never be quite the same.",

        "content": "Story highlightsIn October 2010, a bus driver in New York found a toddler wandering in the streetsRocio De Alba has been photographing the boy since she became his stepmother (CNN)Around 4 a.m. in October 2010, bus driver William Allan was starting his shift in Queens, New York, when something caught his eye: a small boy, shivering in only his underwear, wandering alone in the street. The child didn't speak when approached, the bus driver would later tell several media outlets; he just raised his arms.Later that day, Glen Falk received a phone call from a relative who told him to look at the news: A bus driver had found a 2\u00bd- year-old wandering in the cold. Falk would recognize the name. It was his son.Falk had been battling for custody the boy's entire life. He had seen him only as a newborn, and his partner, Rocio De Alba, had never met the child from Falk's previous relationship. After years of court battles, they thought they were finally closing in on conversations about regular visitation. Instead, within a week and a half after the bus driver's discovery, it was decided: The boy would live with them always, forever.  Read MorePhotographer Rocio De AlbaHis name was Thomas. They met for the first time in a foster home, days after he was plucked from the street, the adults still breathless from the tragedy that could've been. Falk introduced himself slowly. Thomas seemed to take it in, \"and he just sort of fell into his arms, with this look of exhaustion,\" De Alba remembers now. \"'Just take me.'\"In his new home, Thomas was wild, curious and independent, a 2\u00bd-year old who didn't know how to use a spoon, didn't want to wear clothes, and didn't understand eating a meal, taking a bath or going to bed. He hardly spoke during the day, but he often woke up screaming in the middle of the night. De Alba, a photographer, already had a daughter and son who were used to the incessant snapping of their mother's camera as she established her style and career. When Thomas arrived, the camera became a tool as she tried to shape a bond with the wily toddler who crashed into their lives.\"There was a sort of beauty about him,\" said De Alba, now 44. \"I didn't want him to be seen as this poor child who had been from foster home to foster home and rescued from the street. I didn't want him to define himself that way, nor others. I wanted to show him in this beautiful light that would change his own perspective when the time came.\"I wanted to show him in this beautiful light that would change his own perspective when the time came.Photographer Rocio De AlbaStill, the early days were painful. Thomas couldn't tell them his troubles, and his parents didn't know -- will never know -- the details of his first years. Between Thomas' basic lessons on how to live, De Alba photographed the \"Miracle Baby\" just as he was: delighted, frustrated, confused and introspective. She wanted to understand what he was thinking, and this was the best way she knew how. Behind her camera, she witnessed the immediate camaraderie he found with his new sister and brother. Without anyone asking, he began to call her \"Mommy.\" He learned to giggle when she allowed him to snap the shutter, to roll his eyes like the big kids and say, \"Oh, Mommy, not again.\" As he took her photography to places she never could have imagined, he also made her his mother.\"He taught me a lot about unconditional love,\" De Alba said. \"I knew that my job was to help him through the sort of unstructured lifestyle that he had ... to allow him to be a child. That, I saw right away, was my duty. Falling in love with him, the fact that I was his mother? That was very surprising for me.\"One of the great lessons of being Thomas' mother was learning when to set the camera down. Social mediaFollow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.\"There were important things to capture, but I couldn't because I had to live through it with him,\" De Alba said. \"There were moments I had to be a mom, and moments where I could be a photographer.\" Perhaps the biggest moment came recently, when De Alba and Falk settled beside Thomas, now 7, in the darkness of his bedroom and asked him to read an old news story. It was about a toddler who wandered alone in the streets of Queens one chilly October morning, only to be saved by a bus driver.\"I wonder where this baby is? I wonder what he looks like,\" he said to his parents.De Alba pulled out a photograph of Thomas and gave it to him. \"The baby is me?\" he said. \"I'm this baby?\" No man had ever fought so hard for a child as your father did for you, they told him, and De Alba is your mother, even if you didn't come from her belly. This is your story, they explained, but this is not all of who you are.De Alba wants the world to see that Thomas thrives. He is smart and gentle, a boy who cuddles with his father and knows how to ask his mother for help. He likes drawing and superheroes. He loves his sister and brothers. He will face challenges in the future, and that's OK. He's in a home overflowing with love.Thomas, always curious, has a lot of questions. His parents don't have answers, but there's one they're seeking out: Thomas wants to meet William Allan. His parents are searching now for the man who saved their son. The moment when Thomas raised his arms to the bus driver, that \"was what brought him to a place where he could be nurtured and loved and cared for and have a fair shot,\" De Alba said. \"To me, that was the beginning of his life.\"That, De Alba thinks, is the photo she still needs.Rocio De Alba is a New York-based photographer with Visura's Guild.

Yes, they still have to bring books for calculus, history, science and French.Notebooks? Check. Binders, too, and agendas and planners and bundles of sharpened pencils and fresh pens. Oh, and a book for pleasure -- Harry Potter is still popular, if weighty. They can't leave behind their swimsuit for gym class, their shoes for cheerleading, their sweats for football, or their French horns or cellos. Don't forget snacks. Cookies, crackers, an apple. Lots of water bottles. Then there's all the little stuff that's buried at the bottom, just in case. Hairbrushes. Flashlights. Chess pieces. A ball to toss around. An origami frog, just because it's awesome.Noah, third grade, 8.9 poundsDozens of students in Atlanta opened their backpacks to CNN to reveal: What's really inside those big, heavy backpacks, anyway?Read MoreNone of this surprises Karen Jacobs, a clinical professor in occupational therapy at Boston University. Backpacks become a \"portable life support system\" filled with supplies and goodies students probably won't need that day, but feel they must carry anyway, she said. The general rule: Backpacks should weigh no more than 10% of a child's weight. She can spot changes in students' postures in any school hallway. \"They look like turtles; they're walking forward, the posture changed,\" said Jacobs, who is past president of the American Occupational Therapy Association, which touts a backpack awareness day as children head back to school every fall. \"Some will complain they have headaches, pain in the shoulders, neck, backs.\"In the short-term, students might notice aches and pains, but most won't realize that backpacks could be to blame. Few students told CNN their backpacks were too heavy, although most admitted they sometimes struggle to lift them, and it can be uncomfortable to carry them for more than a few minutes.Long-term, children and teens with back problems are more likely to become adults with back problems, Jacobs said. More research is needed to uncover whether heavy backpacks are causing other lasting effects or making people shorter, though, she said.One small 2010 study of eight children published in the journal Spine found that heavier loads compressed their spines. A much larger 2012 study published in the Archives of Disease in Childhood did not see significant effects on the spines of 1,400 students who carried backpacks. Another study, published in BioMed Research International in August, studied 109 7-year-olds in Poland. It found that backpacks heavier than 10% of a child's body weight can cause the back to lean one way or another, and that lighter backpacks could ease the strain on their spines. In all cases, researchers found that too-heavy backpacks can leave children in pain.So, what's inside those bags?The many, many things they carriedNot every backpack was too heavy. Some older students said they'd learned to cut down their load as they'd gotten closer to graduation. The youngest children often carried just a paperback book, a folder and a few colored pencils or markers. Jahi Polk, a first grader at KIPP STRIVE Primary in Atlanta, said when he didn't want to carry his crayons anymore, he spoke up.\"My mom took care of them because I said it was sooooo heavy,\" he said.Then there's Elijah Marbuary, an 11th grader at KIPP Atlanta Collegiate high school, who carried the heaviest backpack CNN weighed. He is studying advanced placement literature, environmental science, geography and U.S. history, honors pre-calculus, and he's in student government and band. (His French horn, at least, stays in one place most of the time.) He rarely gets home before 8 p.m., he said, so he tries to finish as much work as possible before then. The only way to take advantage of the time is to keep all his materials close.\"I just like to have all my stuff with me,\" he said. \"I don't want to bother a teacher, asking him to go to my locker.\"Allie, 11th grade, 23.5 poundsSome don't have access to lockers, or they prefer not to use them. The hallways are too crowded, and it takes too long to stop between classes, students said. There's a culture of carrying a big backpack in some grades, too. Allie Jeffay, an 11th grader at Westminster Upper School in Atlanta, said she used her locker in earlier grades, but it was less convenient now, even though her backpack topped 23 pounds. She needed some of her school books, but she really just enjoyed having a few things of her own, like her script for the musical \"Titanic.\"\"It's really fun to have that physical manifestation of what you're doing,\" she said. \"We only get to keep them for a month or two.\" Westminster Lower School fourth-grader Jaia Alli's backpack weighed more than 11 pounds and included keychains of Mickey Mouse and a Minion, plus her swim clothes, her agenda and her materials to study chess. She gravely said she tried to keep it light: \"I don't want to have to spend a few days in the hospital.\"Noah Amos, a third-grader at KIPP STRIVE Primary, had a hard time choosing which item he uses most. His tablet? His index cards for studying? His notebook? All of them, he said. If he had to leave something behind, he said, it would probably be one of his two flashlights. You know, just in case.\"It feels like I'm carrying a 100 pound baby,\" he said, \"but the stuff really comes in handy.\"The safest way to wear a backpackOf course, most students don't need to have a heavy backpack, but they do need to be reminded to clear it out.Jacobs from the American Occupational Therapy Association has this advice for parents: Avoid the temptation to buy a backpack just because it features a beloved cartoon character, or a bag that gives a child room to grow. That probably just means it's too big, and too easy to overfill.Instead, look for a backpack made of lightweight material with two fully padded straps and a padded back. It should fit below the shoulder blades and stop at the waist. For older students, hip straps can help keep it in place. It doesn't need to have a lot of compartments, Jacobs said -- if students have them, they will fill them -- but you might want a bag with a side pocket for a water bottle, as many young people carry them in school.When packing the bag, get in the habit of putting the heaviest items closest to the student's back. Look for other ways to lighten the load, Jacobs said, like soft lunch containers and lightweight water bottles. For young people who haul large musical instruments or awkward sports equipment, look for cases or carts that move on wheels. Urge young people to take the time to slip both straps on, rather than slinging a strap over one shoulder. Parents and teachers can always ask this simple question, too: Do you need that?\"Kids are responsive to education because they don't want to be in pain, they don't want to trip and fall, they don't want to walk in a funny way,\" Jacobs said. \"Do they need that extra battery? Do they really need to [carry] their science book when they don't have science? Would it make sense to have smaller binders for each of the subjects?\"",

        "content": "Story highlightsSome families celebrate Christmas without the Santa storyChild development expert: Skipping Santa can mean developing other meaningful traditions (CNN)On December 24, so the old story goes, Santa Claus and his magical reindeer fly down from the North Pole with a toy-filled sleigh to leave gifts beneath the Christmas trees of good little children.Except, of course, he doesn't come to every house -- even houses with perfectly charming children who love Christmas. In an age of sharing red-faced, sobbing Santa photos on social media and an Elf on the Shelf overload, some parents simply put the kibosh on the jolly bearded fellow.They're not fun-hating, elf-slaying Christmas contrarians, they said. They celebrate. They just don't tell their kids that Santa Claus is watching, that he'll tiptoe into their homes on Christmas Eve or that he'll reward them with gifts.Their reasons vary: They don't want to lie, they don't want to give Santa credit for gifts or they don't support the North Pole behavior police. Some said they don't want to set their kids up for a hard fall when they learn the truth. Others said they don't want to confuse religious celebrations with a marketable myth. Read More\"I never uttered, 'Santa isn't real,' \" said Myndee Corkern, a mother of three whose family doesn't \"do Santa.\" \"We just leave it out. It's just pretend.\" But the parents who decide on a Santa-free celebration say their choice often doesn't sit well with others.Drawing a line in the snowKevin Cuthbertson has seen the eye rolls.He and his wife have occasionally been accused of \"robbing the joy of Christmas.\" Other Santa-free parents he knows have heard even worse. He lives outside Atlanta and is the pastor of a Southern Baptist church, and although he loved receiving gifts from Santa as a kid, he struggled with the idea of sharing that story as he teaches about Jesus. \"We didn't want to ride that line to where this thing they can't see and can't touch is true and this one is not true. 'Are the other things they told us not true?' \" said Cuthbertson, a father of six. \"Let's just play it safe and not do that.\"Kids say the darndest things about God Generally, there's no harm in going along with the Santa story, and no harm in skipping it, either, said Stephanie M. Wagner, a clinical assistant professor in the department of child and adolescent psychiatry at NYU Langone's Child Study Center. Young children, especially around ages 3 to 5, are in an intensely imaginative period of development, she said. Parents who decide against the Santa story should know he isn't the only magic out there: Children will still hear monsters under the bed or see fairies in the flower garden. \"Pretend play explodes during this time. It's really fun for them,\" Wagner Said. \"What is harmful is going to great lengths to prove Santa exists, and coming up with elaborate stories once they start questioning.\"If a kid seems skeptical of how Santa fits presents on his sleigh or how he gets into houses without chimneys, parents might want to ask children what they believe, she said. That child might be ready to give it up, or just take a step back from the hoopla, Wagner said, even if they're still willing to share a Christmas wish with the Santa at the mall.Corkern still remembers being 5 \u00bd and eagerly awaiting Santa's arrival at the family Christmas party. She wasn't emotionally ready when her older brother picked that moment to spill the big secret.\"I remember so vividly the devastation,\" Corkern said. \"I'm sure I still have fond memories, but all of them are tainted by the finding-out-the-truth moment.\"Corkern and her husband were in agreement: They wouldn't lie, and they wouldn't set their kids up for a hard fall. They'll watch \"The Santa Clause,\" they'll even snap a photo with Santa, but he's like any other fictional character. Their kids get no presents from Santa, and they never talk about a naughty or nice list.\"I want them to be inherently good, not good because they might get something. Even if it's less magical, I would rather that,\" said Corkern, who wrote about her family's Santa-less Christmas for NewOrleansMomsBlog, part of City Moms blog network. \"I don't think they're missing out.\"Finding the magicWagner, of NYU Langone's Child Study Center, doesn't recommend setting up Santa as the all-knowing arbiter of good behavior. The promise or threat of Kris Kringle is not likely to lead to long-term behavior habits, she said.\"It sends the wrong message. Maybe you're using it as a crutch during a hard month  ... you're not going to see changes from that beyond Christmas,\" Wagner said. After December, \"it's out of kids' minds, and it's not on parents' minds.\"Space station plays Santa's sleigh for kids in UKStefanie Bagby, a mother of a 10-month-old, grew up with \"Santa -- wink, wink,\" she said. She never believed he was real. But she remembers seeing adults pick up the phone to \"call Santa\" when a child acted up.  It's not something her parents would've done, and not something she'll do, she said.\"Presents were more expression of joy and love, not because 'You were so good you get this,' \" said Bagby, who lives outside Atlanta. \"You get presents whether you're good or bad because we love you. That's the Christmas story.\"Still, Bagby remembers her parents warning her not to say anything to others kids -- even the teenage cousin who professed to still believe -- and she'll have the same talk with her child. Corkern and Cuthbertson agreed.\"I definitely want to be respectful ... but I have my own convictions, as everyone does,\" Corkern said. \"I can't raise my kids according to other people's traditions.\"'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer' figurines get a second lifeWagner recommends families that celebrate Christmas start early with traditions that match their values. When the Santa secret is out, if it was ever there at all, the holiday won't feel any less special. \"It might be they're going to help make cookies, help get gifts ready from Santa for younger siblings, do some volunteer work,\" Wagner said. \"Whatever it is, think about, if we're giving up one (tradition), how do we get others going that foster the same feeling?\"On Christmas Day, Corkern and her family will talk about Saint Nicholas and open presents beneath the tree. Despite their Santa-free stance, Corkern said, her 3-year-old has heard the story and seems to believe it. They won't reject it, but they won't prop it up, either.Cuthbertson's family will sing happy birthday to Jesus, share in freshly baked monkey bread and open gifts. Each of the six children will get a photo book of memories and moments from the past year, personally designed by his wife -- no Santa needed.This will be Bagby's child's first Christmas, so they're creating their own traditions, fueled by their fondest memories of low-key, Santa-free, still magical holidays.She recalls visiting family in Montana one year, far away from her home in Miami, where lights twinkled on palm trees and Santas wore board shorts. Far north, there were still no gifts form Santa, but there were jingle bells and Santa hats, hot cocoa and angels in the snow -- real snow. \"The focus was on the joy and the love and the family,\" she said. \"Magic.\"",

        "content": "Story highlightsStudents from a Georgia high school hosted their first integrated prom last weekendFor more than 40 years, students' proms were private, racially segregated eventsAfter prom story went viral, people offered up support, cash, dresses, DJSuperintendent: High school will consider hosting prom in 2014It's a springtime tradition in this stretch of the magnolia midlands for crowds to gather at high school students' proms. They'll cheer for teens in tuxedos and gowns while an announcer reads what the students will do once they leave this pecan grove skyline. Earlier this month, Wilcox County High School senior Mareshia Rucker rode to a historic theater in the nearby town of Fitzgerald to see her own classmates' prom celebration. She never left the car, even to catch up with her friends. She'd recently helped to invite the critical gaze of the world to her county; few would be happy to see her there, she said. Besides, she's black and wasn't invited to this prom reserved for white students anyway.For as long as most remember, Wilcox County High School hasn't sponsored a prom for its 400 students. Instead, parents and their children organize their own private, off-site parties, known casually as white prom and black prom -- a vestige of racial segregation that still lives on.\"When people say that seeing is believing, it truly is,\" Mareshia says a few days later from the comfortable bustle of her family's kitchen, central command for the three generations that share it. \"Just talking about it, it didn't hurt my feelings. I didn't care,\" she says. \"When I saw it, I felt really crappy. I didn't understand what was so different about me and them.\"She apologizes as her eyes grow shiny and tears dribble down her face. Toni Rucker swoops in to fold her arms around her oldest daughter.\"What is the difference,\" she murmurs, Mareshia's head resting on her chest. \"There is no difference.\"Mareshia and her friends bucked 40 years of local customs this month by organizing their own integrated prom, a formal dance open to Wilcox County's white, black, Latino and Asian high school students. Organizers, both black and white, said they lost friends in the process -- a grim experience in the waning weeks of the school year. It's been hard on the rest of their hometown, too.Mareshia Rucker and Arkel Bennett attended Wilcox County High School students' first integrated prom.When the story erupted on TV and social media, Wilcox County became a symbol of race relations stuck in the past. People around the world heard about the sneers from some classmates, the silence from some adults, the school board that says it supports them but didn't sponsor its own prom. Thousands lashed out at the old tradition or offered up kind words, cash, dresses, a DJ. Stunned, they wanted to know, could this be true? In 2013?Segregated proms are a longstanding reality in this farming community 160 miles south of Atlanta, and until recently, at several schools nearby. Some in Wilcox County say it's just an old habit that's hard to break. A few argue the proms are private because of cost and liability or because parents won't cede control. They say people \"self-segregate,\" and kids can't agree on country or hip-hop, \"white music\" or \"black music.\" Some say some preachers and some parents implicitly encourage segregation, but there's no point to arguing: People are entitled to their opinions, even if they're racist.Plenty here shrug off the debate entirely and say a high school dance is nothing to make a fuss about. PHOTOS: See images from Wilcox students' first integrated promMareshia is 17, a good student, a cheerleader who's active in the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps. She knew long ago that proms were segregated, but she didn't think much about it till last year, when she and three friends first realized they'd be split up.\"How do you want your last moments of high school to be,\" Mareshia asked herself then. \"What do you want your memories to encompass?\"More than 40 years after these South Georgia schools desegregated, students are still separated on what they see as the brightest nights of their lives. Some from all the county's small towns -- Abbeville, Pineview, Pitts, Rochelle -- say nobody ever questioned the segregation till this year. But keep asking, and high school graduates will say they wondered about it, questioned it or even asked to make a change. Until this year, the plans always fell through.\"We were different because we always have been together throughout school,\" Mareshia said. \"We've cheered together at football games. We've gone to each other's houses and spent the night...There was no need in us having two separate [proms.]\"High school is brief, though, and memories are short. Decades earlier, Wilcox County alumni remembered, there was no prom at all. 'A prom I never had'In 1970, Barbara King's mom made a trip to the city for a ruffled peach gown for her daughter's junior prom, a formal dance in the school gym. King attended Excelsior, a school for all of Wilcox County's black students. White students went to a school down the road in Rochelle, the county's largest city.The Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education decision had struck down the legal basis for \"separate but equal\" schools in 1954, but state politics had stalled integration so long, King never thought it would happen. Excelsior had loving teachers, a new football team, a competitive a cappella choir and, naturally, its own prom.But before school let out for the summer, they learned Excelsior would close. The black students would integrate into the all-white Wilcox County schools. They cried, she says, out of sadness and fear.

In that volatile atmosphere, students learned there would be no homecoming dance. Before long, they understood there would be no prom either.It was a blow to everyone, King says. She doesn't remember any proms or private, formal parties happening -- it never occurred to them to plan a dance outside the gym. Integration was painful, but it would get easier.\"I always felt that we were robbed,\" says King, who now lives in Arizona. \"It was just devastating.\"She didn't realize that tumultuous year might have been the kernel of the county's long tradition of segregated proms. She graduated, left Wilcox County and assumed the big dances were revived a few years later. King only learned the proms remained segregated when her niece, a Wilcox County student, told her about the plan for an integrated prom. Forty years after the struggle to integrate schools, she was shocked to realize kids still fought to integrate their social lives. On the Excelsior Facebook page, which she runs from her home in Arizona, she posted dozens of news stories about the integrated prom and put out calls to donate money.\"I think, deep down, it was my way of having a prom I never had,\" she says.When she thinks back to 1971 now, she believes they could've had a nice prom if they'd been given the chance. It might have meant white students on one side of the gym and black students on another, but they would have danced. Why, she wonders, should today's students fight the same ugly battles they did? Maybe, it's just been too long to remember. \"If there's something that you're born into,\" she says, \"you think it's normal.\"'Picking up the pieces'\"Normal\" for Rochelle is the quiet strip of hair salons and flower shops. Its murals in blue and gold, the colors for the Wilcox County High School Patriots. It's generations that stick close to home, even when jobs are sparse.The unemployment rate is 12.3%, far higher than the nation's 7.6%, and the median income is $31,712. Workers farm, process peanuts, teach kids at school or cook for them in the cafeteria. Some of the county's 9,000 residents commute about 20 miles to Cordele or even 45 miles to Tifton just to keep a paycheck coming.People here will talk about jobs and the economy -- they know that's a problem. Race? Not so much.LISTEN: Hear more about the prom on CNN Radio News Day \"Nobody wants to be called a racist,\" says lifelong Wilcox County resident Melissa Davis, 39.She and her husband run Skin Deep Tattoos and Piercings in Rochelle. Christian imagery is popular among their clients -- Jesus' face, crosses -- and American Indian symbols. The county is about 62% white, 35% black, 3% Latino. On the 2010 Census, Asians and American Indians hardly register. Diverse customers come to every shop in Rochelle, Davis says, but if the town has a reputation for racism, how would that hurt business?After all the coverage about the prom, it stings to overhear insults at the store, or read them online and know who they're about. Outsiders don't see how people rally in hard times, she said. Her neighbors give generously and buy endless plates of barbecue and beans to support each other's causes.Personally, she supports an integrated prom. She had a great time at her own segregated prom about 20 years ago, but it didn't make much sense to her then, she said. Someday, she hopes her 15-year-old son attends a school-sponsored prom that's open to everybody. But she can understand why so few people want to talk about it.\"These young girls, I applaud them in one sense because they were willing to do something, but then I look at them and think to myself, there is such a better way of doing this than going to the media,\" Davis says. \"They're going to graduate. They're going to be leaving this little town...we're not. We're going to be sitting here picking up the pieces for years.\"Harriet Hollis, the racial healing coordinator for the nonprofit Southwest Georgia Project for Community Education, says media attention was necessary to start the conversation about the prom, and disparities in schools and the workforce.\"I can't go in talking about 'racial healing,'\" Hollis says. \"People won't call me back.\"She helped the teens coordinate the integrated prom and hates that people feel they were portrayed incorrectly. But it's difficult to raise awareness when people are afraid to lose customers, offend neighbors or be ostracized at church. Talking about race in a small town is a quick way to risk everything.\"You realize it takes courage to do this kind of stuff,\" she remembers telling the teens planning the integrated prom. \"You're going to get pushback. You're going to get teachers who are not going to be happy, and classmates who don't want you to do it.\"They told her, \"'This can happen. We can do this.'\"'It could have been us'Just last spring, Ashley Saylor didn't even try to buy a prom ticket. She approached the committee planning the white prom with a question:  \"Are you going to let us go together?\" Ashley and her boyfriend, Antonio Gibson, were seniors. As freshmen, they sat across from each other in JROTC. They talked, texted and dated ever since.Ashley is white; Antonio is black. They hid their relationship at first. Ashley's mom \"wasn't raised that way,\" and even strangers shot nasty looks. But people grew to love them as a couple, including their parents, teachers and friends. Wilcox County High School graduates  Antonio and Ashley Gibson attended JROTC military balls, but never a prom.They'd gone together to the school's annual JROTC ball for years; it has always been integrated. She swears she remembers every second of their first dance -- her turquoise dress with the low back and not-too-high slit, his dress green uniform, the words to the GinuWine song, \"Differences.\"My whole life has changedSince you came in, I knew back thenYou were that special oneI'm so in love, so deep in loveWith their years in high school ending and Antonio heading to basic training, she wanted another dance. They weren't the first ones to float the idea of an integrated prom, she said, so she posed the question to the white students.\"I was told that I should just bring someone else,\" Ashley says. \"Bring someone who is white.\"Ashley cried in her mom's arms. It stressed her relationship with Antonio. So many things were changing; they couldn't stomach a fight with 40-year-old prom rituals, or the people who kept them going.\"It's hard to grow up in that town and not be racist,\" she says.Her name is Ashley Gibson now. She and Antonio married, and have a daughter, 5-month-old Riley Jean. They live near San Diego, where Antonio is stationed with the Navy. She still keeps their last JROTC ball photo on their dresser. When she heard about Wilcox County's new integrated prom, she wished she'd fought harder for it -- for another chance to mark the end of high school, to dress up with her oldest friends, to dance with the man she'd marry. It might have been different if she'd known that one year later some of her old Wilcox County classmates would pull it off.\"It could've been us. We could've done it,\" Ashley said. \"It was all about taking the first step.\"'The timing was just right'Why this year? How could they carry out an integrated prom now, but not 1971, 2012, or the decades between? Part of it might be Facebook, students suggested. They're all friends, and that's where evidence of limousine rides and slow dances tick across the screen.Some said it was the outside help, the media attention, the voice of the NAACP. The neighbors who paid for car washes, doughnuts of barbecue plates were key, the students agree. So, too, were the parents.\"When you have people in your county stand with you...it makes everything easier,\" said Brandon Davis, a white Wilcox County senior who helped to plan the integrated prom. \"When my parents told me, 'We will stand beside you and support you,' that was just amazing.\"Barbara King, who graduated with the first integrated class, says she could already see some change in Wilcox County when she returned for a reunion last year. Black and white people sat together in the stands during the Patriots' homecoming football game. Some white classmates -- the same folks she hardly spoke to in high school -- came to the class celebration.Ashley Gibson said she and Antonio could move back someday. She loves how, in the last couple years, people stopped her on the street or in the bank just to ask about her husband and baby.\"For people who don't live in a situation like this, it's so normal. Where we came from, that's a huge deal,\" she says. \"Regardless of what happened, and what we've been through, and how much it forced us to grow, I love my town.\"By this time next year, prom in Wilcox County could be entirely different. The high school's leadership will consider hosting a prom in 2014, Superintendent Steve Smith says. It might not eliminate private, segregated proms, but if it happens, it could promise a dance open to everybody.\"Maybe the timing was just right,\" Smith says. \"I'm proud of 'em. It's a shame, I guess, that it takes four teenage girls to open our eyes.\"On Saturday night, at the community clubhouse in Cordele, a finger-food dinner of chicken wings, red velvet cupcakes and peach lemonade awaited. A DJ drove 14 hours from Houston with strobe lights and speakers to blare Flo Rida, Justin Timberlake and Rihanna. A basket of feathered masks -- a complement to their theme, \"Masquerade Ball in Paris\" -- waited by the door.About 100 people came to the integrated prom, most of them from Wilcox County. Even more came for that other old tradition -- watching. There were fathers, grandmothers, curious onlookers, reporters, a gaggle of students from Atlanta, a local NAACP rep and Shirley Sherrod, the former U.S. Department of Agriculture official in Georgia who was smeared by a misleading video that showed her discussing race.Students wobbled in rhinestone-studded heels, traded tuxes for T-shirts, stole away to dark corners, shared a toast of sparkling grape juice, crowned a king and queen, Harlem shook, cha-cha slid.In the last minutes of the prom, a few soft piano chords melted out of the speakers -- the slowest song of the night so far. Girls clasped their hands around their date's necks. A few friends made sloppy waltzes around the dance floor.In one corner, a pair swayed back and forth, at first just holding hands. Then two more joined in, then a few more and more still. The circle unfurled, and grew hand by hand to include almost every person in the room.It seemed like what Mareshia hoped for when they started: \"If we're all together and we love each other the way we say we do, then there are no issues,\" she said. \"This is something that should have happened a long time ago.\"Follow CNN's Schools of Thought on Twitter",

        "content": "Story highlightsThe College Board says the next SAT won't include little-used, forgettable \"SAT words\" The college test will incorporate words with different meanings based on contextChanging the SAT won't necessarily mean vocabulary words fade into obscurityLinguist: \"Everything is an SAT word to somebody\"Some years ago, I interviewed a pair of farmers selling pastured, hormone- and antibiotic-free turkeys for $4.75 a pound. They were heritage breed birds, Bourbon reds whose numbers had dwindled to dangerously low levels as the broad-breasted white -- the Butterball -- dominated.At the time, the farmers were still a little queasy about slaughtering and selling livestock they'd raised. (One farmer had been a longtime vegetarian.) But by giving these turkeys a productive death, they explained, they were actually helping them survive.If they weren't for dinner, these birds just weren't useful. They were neither cuddly nor well-behaved. They made terrible pets, and weren't well-suited for life in the wilderness. They weren't destined for poultry popularity, either -- maybe your grandparents would recognize their gamey flavor, but it was nothing like the gravy-slathered protein that generations had gobbled down over the holidays.But if they enticed enough Thanksgiving cooks to prepare them, the farmers saw a win for biodiversity and the birds. Give them a reason to exist, and these turkeys could thrive.I thought of those birds recently when College Board President and CEO David Coleman explained sweeping changes planned for the SAT exam. Come spring 2016, the essay will be optional. The score scale will return to familiar ol' 1600. The test prep will be free, and delivered via Khan Academy.And, the SAT word will be no more, Coleman said. Just like those old-timey turkeys, it seems there's limited use for the $5 words we've come to expect from the SAT.JUST WATCHEDSAT prep tests to be free for everyoneReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSAT prep tests to be free for everyone 01:21JUST WATCHEDCould you spell THIS word? ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCould you spell THIS word?  01:38JUST WATCHEDEpic spelling bee finally hails a winnerReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHEpic spelling bee finally hails a winner 01:54\"Today, when we say that someone has used an SAT word, it often means a word you have not heard before and are not likely to soon hear again,\" Coleman explained in his announcement.You know these words if you took the test, its preparatory cousin, the PSAT, or almost any college-minded standardized test. You flipped through their definitions on flash cards, or faced them in a spelling bee, if you were that kind of kid. You probably still use a number of them: \"threatened,\" \"vigilant,\" \"predicting,\" \"ousting\" and \"strengthened\" all appeared on an SAT test in 2013.Of course, \"bellicosity,\" \"obduracy\" and \"garrulous\" were on the test, too.After the frenzy and stress of SAT cramming, the words become kind of a parenthetical joke, a chance to finally giggle at the absurdity of it all. Drop \"mellifluous\" or \"loquacious\" into a sentence after the college applications are sent, and you can actually stop to appreciate it -- \"Hey, I just used an SAT word!\"Coleman said he's done indulging tricks and flash cards that promise to beat his test, especially at the expense of deep, analytical reading and understanding. If the college exam tests only obscure vocabulary words, \"students stop reading and start flipping,\" he said.The redesigned SAT will instead focus on words students are likely to use over and over again, he said, like \"synthesis\" and \"empirical.\"\"The SAT will honor the best work of our classrooms -- reading widely and learning how words work in their different contexts,\" he said. \"We aim to offer worthy challenges, not artificial obstacles.\"But I wondered, if the SAT abandons these words, what will become of \"treacly\" and \"mendacious\"? Are they turkeys on the verge of extinction?Hardly, linguist Geoffrey Nunberg explained. The SAT wasn't keeping them alive, he said, and flash cards weren't doing justice to many words, anyway.Sure, those quick definitions did well enough for a multiple choice test. \"You can pick 'em out of a lineup,\" said Nunberg, who teaches in University of California Berkeley's School of Information. \"If you see 'mendacious' and you think 'dishonest,' you've got the main idea.\"But \"empirical,\" he said? Now that's a complex word. It's got varied and layered meanings, some buried deep in history, or evolving only now. \"Under the guise of providing more user-friendly, fair tests, they're merely substituting one set of SAT words for another,\" Nunberg said. \"If anything, this calls for more tutoring, and more background than the old words.\"He suspects that students might remember more from their SAT study sessions than anybody realizes, but the words are even less forgettable if students learn them through reading instead of flash cards. Regardless, the test will never get much credit; if you memorize a word and use it often enough, he said, you're unlikely to be able to pinpoint that you learned it for the SAT.And if you don't use it?\"If people don't use the word,\" Nunberg said, \"it's because they don't need the word.\"There are no guarantees about the vocabulary of the future SAT. The College Board certainly hasn't released a list of banned words, and it's not as if the passages will suddenly read like \"Fun with Dick and Jane.\" It wouldn't be a test, Nunberg said, if everybody could answer all the questions correctly.\"Everything is an SAT word to somebody,\" he said. Consider just one of the changes coming to the SAT in 2016: Each exam will include passages from meaningful historic documents like the Declaration of Independence, the Federalist Papers and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"Letter from Birmingham Jail.\" In King's nearly 7,000-word letter, he dropped \"cognizant,\" \"superficial,\" \"moratorium,\" \"unfettered,\" \"ominous,\" \"ordinance,\" \"paternalistically,\" \"incorrigible,\" \"zeitgeist,\" \"sanctimonious,\" \"nullification,\" \"gladiatorial,\" \"scintillating\" and \"existential.\" Any of them could be called an \"SAT word.\" Any of them could be on the new test.So, word lovers, do not mourn the next generation's vocabulary. Educators, do not celebrate the end of flash cards. The SAT word is dead, long live the SAT word. These turkeys still have a long time to cook.What do you think of the changes to the SAT?

        "content": "(CNN)A California man who spent 14 years in prison for the murder of a newspaper columnist has been exonerated thanks to the same DNA technology that caught the Golden State Killer suspect, authorities said. Ricky Davis was convicted of second-degree murder in the 1985 fatal stabbing of 54-year-old Jane Hylton. He walked free from prison Thursday, CNN affiliate KOVR reported, hours after becoming the first person in California to be exonerated with the help of genetic genealogy -- the combination of DNA analysis and family tree research.In 1985, Hylton was found dead inside an El Dorado Hills, California, home that she shared with her daughter, Davis and his then-girlfriend, and another woman, according to the Northern California Innocence Project, which represented Davis.Davis and his girlfriend, who were returning from a party, along with Hylton's daughter, who had been out with friends, found Hylton dead in one of the bedrooms, the NCIP said.The case went cold until 1999, when investigators reopened the case. Police interrogated Davis' girlfriend several times and she ultimately changed her story, implicating Davis and herself in Hylton's death, the NCIP said. Read MoreIn 2005, Davis was convicted and sentenced to 16 years to life in state prison, authorities said. His girlfriend received a year in county jail.It started as a hobby. Now they're using DNA to help cops crack cold casesAfter his conviction, the Northern California Innocence Project took on Davis' case and requested the El Dorado County district attorney do post-conviction DNA testing. In 2014, forensic experts began an \"extremely meticulous process\" of examining the evidence of the case and eventually found DNA that did not belong to Davis, said Sacramento County District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert, who has been leading the efforts to use DNA evidence in cold cases.Davis' case was reopened and last year, a judge reversed his conviction and ordered a new trial, Schubert said.He is now the first person in California, and the second in the country, to be exonerated after the use of genetic genealogy, Schubert said.Last year, a man in Idaho who was convicted in the 1996 killing of Angie Dodge was exonerated after spending 22 years in jail, according to the Idaho State Police.\"Investigative genetic genealogy, just like traditional DNA, is about one thing: finding the truth no matter what it is,\" Schuber said.A new suspect in Hylton's murder was identified and has been arrested in Roseville, California, according to El Dorado County District Attorney Vern Pierson.A cold case killing from 1972 was cracked with the help of genetic genealogyThe suspect was not identified because he was a juvenile at the time of the killing, Pierson said.\"Ricky Davis was falsely accused, brought to trial, convicted and spent the last 15-some years in custody for a crime I can tell you in all confidence, he did not commit,\" The Golden State Killer case opened the door for genetic genealogy. In the technique, unidentified DNA is uploaded into a public online database -- GEDMatch in the GSK case -- that has more than 1 million DNA profiles from people across the country. The website then produces a list of people who are related to the unidentified DNA, from immediate parents to fourth and fifth cousins. Genetic genealogists can then use obituaries, birth certificates, public documents and social media to try to build a family tree and identify possible suspects.FamilyTreeDNA was the database used in the Davis exoneration.",

What if another horse dies before then?Roadster is trained by hall-of-famer Bob Baffert, who also trained recent Triple Crown winners Justify and American Pharoah.Ninety-six horses were slated to run Saturday at the park's flagship Derby Day. The highest-stakes race is a $1 million West Coast steppingstone to qualify for the 2019 Kentucky Derby. Purse winnings for the entire day total $2.75 million.There were no immediate reports of serious injuries on Saturday.Read MoreSix days ago, the 5-year-old colt Arms Runner was euthanized -- just two days after the track reopened, following a 24-day suspension of racing. The thoroughbred fell and collided with another horse during the San Simeon Stakes.The past week's daily training sessions, and the 16 races held on Thursday and Friday, took place without incident. \"We're back to normal, but there's a lot of anxiety and apprehension -- no question,\" Santa Anita Park spokesman Mike Willman said earlier this week. Saturday, he said more than 3,000 horses have had timed workouts on the track with no issues since March 15.New safety rulesThe Santa Anita Derby is the first high-stakes race held under new safety protocols mandated by the California Horse Racing Board -- the state's independent agency, which regulates race safety and betting.Jockeys are prohibited from using whips to encourage their horses to move forward, unless the safety of the rider or horse are compromised. The administration of same-day medications -- which can often mask the severity of a horse's injury -- are being phased out. The recent spate of deadly incidents has not deterred thousands of racing fans from lining the stands, and waging bets remotely over satellite. 21 horses died at a single racetrack in the last 10 weeks. How did it happen? \"It shouldn't stop people from coming,\" said Chris Maurath, who had settled in early for a full day of racing. \"It's a random chance event ... you have lulls, and you have spikes ... if it continues at this pace, then there's a real problem, but it hasn't gotten to that point. It's sad, nobody wants this to happen.\"The company that owns the track said it is working to improve horse safety.\"The fact that horses running in America are five times more likely to suffer catastrophic injury than horses running in international venues is unacceptable and must immediately change,\" the Stronach Group said.It said reforms will move Stronach tracks to be more inline with the regulations of the International Federation of Horse Racing Authorities. 'It's been tough,' worker saysThe supportive buzz in the stands is encouraging to those working on the ground. \"It's been tough,\" said 85-year-old Huey Barnes. Under his watchful eye, thousands of horses have safely come through the starting gate at Santa Anita Park. The octogenarian is an assistant starter, who began his career at the race track when he was a teenager. \"People are talking about this industry ... and I've been with it ever since I was a kid. It's given everything I have ... it got my kids through college,\" he said. As each race ticks by, dozens of spectators continue filing in. In 2018, over 39,000 fans attended the races and festivities surrounding the Santa Anita Derby, which includes a 5k race and a spring carnival.  \"We want to support the sport, we love it,\" said Beth Gerber. \"We love betting on those horses, and the thrill of it. We're not hard-core betters, but it's a great past time.\"After the Derby, Baffert said it was comforting to see a lot of fans -- more than 30,000 -- at the track. \"The fans, despite what they've reading, they showed up,\" he said. \"They know at the end of the day we love our horses. We wake up worrying about them, we go to sleep worrying about them. To me, that's what made this a great day.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)A high-stakes weekend of important races is approaching for Santa Anita Park -- the racetrack where 23 horses have died since December, rocking the industry.On Saturday, the track will host the Santa Anita Derby, a $1,000,000 West Coast steppingstone to qualify for the 2019 Kentucky Derby. There are 36 runs scheduled between Thursday afternoon and Sunday. Eight races were run Thursday.Over 39,000 spectators attended the main event in 2018, and watched hometown favorite Justify win the race on his way to becoming a Triple Crown winner.But this year's Santa Anita Derby comes on the heels of a 24-day suspension of racing at the facility, following the deaths of 22 horses. A 23rd horse, the 5-year-old colt Arms Runner, was euthanized on Sunday -- just two days after the track reopened -- after he fell and collided with another horse during the San Simeon Stakes. Read More2 days after racing resumed, 23rd horse dies at Santa Anita Park Neither the California Horse Racing Board nor the Stronach Group would comment on a contingency plan for Saturday, should a fatal accident occur in the two days leading up to the crown jewel.The park says no horses have been withdrawn from the Santa Anita Derby due to concerns over concerns over the latest deaths.As early morning training sessions continue this week, the mood at Santa Anita can be described as cautiously optimistic.Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert -- whose robust roster of trainees includes recent Triple Crown winners Justify and American Pharoah -- plans to race two up-and-coming horses this weekend. His undefeated 3-year-old colt, Game Winner, will go head-to-head against some of the fastest horses around the country. \"Luckily, I haven't had any issues,\" Baffert told reporters during the National Thoroughbred Racing Association's media teleconference on Tuesday. \"If I thought there was a danger out there, I wouldn't even leave my horses out there. I'm feeling good about what's going on here, but I don't want to jinx myself.\"What has changed at the park since the closure?Horses exercising in a morning training session at Santa Anita Park, on Thursday, April 4. Unusually Handsome. Bob's Sniper. General Mo. The thoroughbred race horses are among a field of 10 contenders who will run the first race Thursday afternoon.  Their trip is relatively short -- just over 3/4 of a mile. But all eyes will be down the stretch, to watch for each horse to safely step over the finish line. The deaths of nearly two dozen horses at the park since December have been baffling. Many people connected with the park believe that rain has been a factor in the horses' deaths, but not all agree why. Southern California has just had its wettest winter in almost a decade.Over the last 17 days, horse trainers and handlers have reformed practices to include new safety protocols mandated by the CHRB -- the state's independent agency which grants licenses, promotes race safety, and regulates betting.The CHRB voted unanimously to prohibit jockeys from using whips to encourage their horses to move forward, unless the safety of the rider or horse are compromised. Improper use could result in fines, suspension or forfeiture from purse winnings. The board has also voted to phase out the administration of same-day medications. Veterinarians and trainers will be required to give enough time for steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to clear a horse's system before race day. Both types of medication can often mask the true extent of an animal's injuries.The changes went into effect when Santa Anita Park re-opened on March 29.\"We're back to normal, but there's a lot of anxiety and apprehension -- no question,\" said Santa Anita Park spokesperson Mike Willman.\"(The new procedures) have worked very, very well,\" Willman said. \"I think everybody's embraced them. We know how important it is to be as proactive as we can possibly be.\"After Arms Runner's death on Sunday, the park said the track was safe. \"While this incident happened during competition on a track that has been deemed by independent experts to be safe, we are working closely with the California Horse Racing Board (CHRB) to understand if there was anything additional that we could have done to prevent today's tragedy,\" the park said in a statement.\"Today's incident speaks to the larger issue of catastrophic injuries in horse racing that The Stronach Group together with our industry stakeholders are working to solve throughout California and across the country,\" it stated.The investigation continuesThis week, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein wrote a letter to CHRB Chairman Chuck Winner, calling for suspension of horse racing at Santa Anita Park until the causes of the deaths are fully investigated. \"The death of a single horse is a tragedy, but as a lifelong lover of horses, I'm appalled that almost two dozen horses have died in just four months,\" Feinstein wrote. She also asked whether the board will consider the \"complete elimination of medications such as Lasix and the use of synthetic track surfaces.\"Of the 23 deceased horses, the CHRB has received 21 necropsy reports. The agency is currently waiting for additional information gleaned from interviews which take place following necropsy procedures. A complete investigation could take months.The CHRB says Winner has not yet received the letter from Feinstein, but is aware of it. In a statement, Winner said the CHRB -- under state law -- does not carry the authority to suspend racing. Any action with regard to racing dates requires a public hearing, and 10-day public notice.The board has called for a special meeting on April 12, as it continues to work with the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office on a joint investigation.Feinstein's letter is resonating with animal rights proponents like PETA, who have led the charge to ban all drugs entirely and move events onto a synthetic track. \"Sen. Feinstein's call ... is welcome and sensible and should be nationwide to end the bloodbath in every racing state,\" PETA said in a statement. \"If horses need therapeutic medications, they shouldn't be running. The board must ban trainers who drug horses, instead of assessing paltry fines.\"How the fans feelDespite the negative attention the park has received, track officials say they expect large crowds to gather at Santa Anita on Saturday for the main event.For many long-time fans, however, this rash of deaths has turned them away from watching. \"We don't want to be a part of that, anymore\" racing fan Daniel Barcenas told CNN affiliate KCAL/KCBS.  Barcenas says he witnessed Arms Runner fall to his death while enjoying the day with his family. He didn't stick around to watch the rest of the day's races.\"It hurts us to see that happen to the horses,\" Barcenas said.",

        "content": "(CNN)The family of Stephon Clark, an unarmed black man who was shot and killed in his grandmother's backyard by Sacramento police last year, has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the officers involved and the city of Sacramento. The federal lawsuit, filed Monday, alleges the 22-year-old was racially profiled, and the officers used excessive force in the shooting incident. The two officers failed to identify themselves or issue a verbal warning before firing approximately 20 shots, the suit said. The lawsuit also alleges the officers did not get him medical attention immediately after the shooting.The Sacramento Police Department has never publicly identified the officers.Clark was struck seven times, including three times in the back, according to an autopsy released by the Sacramento County Coroner's office. An independent autopsy found that Clark was shot eight times, six of those wounds in his back, according a forensic pathologist retained by Clark's family.Stephon Clark was shot by police 8 times -- 6 of them in the back, doctor retained by family saysAuthorities have said the two Sacramento officers who shot Clark were responding to a report that a man had broken car windows and was hiding in a backyard. Police chased that man -- later identified as Clark -- who hopped a fence into his grandmother's property. He was shot in her backyard on the night of March 18. Read MorePolice said the officers who fired at Clark believed he was pointing a gun at them. But investigators determined Clark was actually carrying a cell phone.JUST WATCHEDGrandmother's emotional plea: I want justiceReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHGrandmother's emotional plea: I want justice 00:50\"When the facts are fully disclosed, we are confident that a jury will deliver justice that reflects how grossly the police land city officials failed Stephon, his family and the people of Sacramento,\" Brian Panish an attorney for Clark's children said in a statement.The lawsuit, filed on behalf of Clark's sons, his parents and grandparents, seeks damages of more than $20 million, plus funeral and burial expenses. \"The Sacramento police executed Stephon Clark in his grandparents' backyard, mistaking his cell phone for a gun, assuming he was a criminal threat simply because he was a black man,\" civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, one of the attorneys representing Clark's family, said in a statement. \"Stephon's life had value. In America, a life -- even a black life -- can't be arbitrarily extinguished without holding those responsible accountable.\" Sacramento police had no immediate comment on the lawsuit. When reached by local media, including the Sacramento Bee, the department referred questions to the city attorney's office.\"Out of deference to the judicial process and because this is a matter of active litigation, we must respectfully decline to comment,\" City Attorney Susana Alcala Wood said in a statement. Sacramento residents voice outrage over Stephon Clark's shooting deathThe officers' union could not be reached Monday. The Sacramento District Attorney's Office is reviewing whether the officers' conduct constitutes a crime that could be prosecuted under state law, the office said in a statement. The California Attorney General's Office previously said it was also conducting an independent investigation.In October, the district attorney's office said it received \"the voluminous investigative report and related materials\" about the shooting from Sacramento police. On January 16, the district attorney's office said prosecutors also received \"substantial investigative reports and related materials\" from Department of Justice investigators in the Attorney General's Office.Stevante Clark, left, and his brother Stephon Clark.\"Our timeline for completion of our review has thus been delayed as we process the supplemental materials. We will take whatever time is needed to ensure a fair, thorough, and accurate review of this matter,\" the statement said. After the shooting, protests erupted for several days in Sacramento as tempers flared. Frustrated residents and Black Lives Matter activists urged accountability for the shooting. At one point, protesters blocked the entrance to the Golden 1 Center, where the Sacramento Kings play, forcing them to play a game against the Atlanta Hawks in a nearly empty arena.

        "content": "(CNN)P-64 lived by his own rules. The approximately 4-year-old mountain lion was known for crossing the 101 and 118 Freeways northwest of Los Angeles, using a storm drain as his bridge. According to the National Park Service, P-64 made the trek more than 40 times. His crossings awarded him the nickname \"Culvert Cat,\" because of the culverts he used to cross the highways. The big cat's treks will be no more, though, as he was found dead Monday with burn prints on his paws. The discovery by a biologist with Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area took place weeks after the Woolsey Fire was contained. The Woolsey fire was one of three fires that ravaged California in November. The burn scar from California's Woolsey Fire is visible from spaceKate Kuykendall, a spokeswoman for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, said their group has been tracking the \"Culvert Cat\" since February. He was captured in partnership with The Boeing Company at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory in the Simi Hills and fitted with a GPS collar, according to a National Park Service news release. Five days after the Woolsey Fire was deemed 100% contained, on November 26, an NPS biologist located P-64 with telemetry device. Another GPS location was transmitted on November 28. The biologist, NPS said, hiked to the location where the lion's location was alerted on Tuesday, where his remains were found.Read MoreThe cause of death is not known, the National Park Service said.He possibly leaves behind four cubs -- \"possible'\" because DNA testing is needed -- who were born in May. Kuykendall said because the cubs are uncollared, it's unknown whether they survived, too.P-64 isn't the only recent mountain lion fatality. P-74, who wasn't blessed enough to get a nickname, is believed to have died in the Woolsey Fire. His remains have not been found, Kuykendall said, but based on his GPS location during the fire it's believed he died. Heavy rains douse California's deadliest wildfire and pose new dangers The park service says Los Angeles is one of two megacities in the world -- along with Mumbai, India -- where big cats live within city limits. The long-term survival of mountain lions in this region is threatened by many variables, one of the most prominent being infrastructure development. This can lead to deaths by vehicle crashes and inbreeding due to the animals not being able to move around as much.    Kuykendall says there's an effort underway to build a wildlife crossing over the 101 Freeway near Agoura Hills. Once complete, it will be the largest wildlife crossing in the United States -- stretching over 10 freeway lanes. The environmental compliance work is completed, and the crossing is expected to be complete in 2022.Kuykendall said she hopes the crossing will improve connectivity among mountain lions, as they like to move to different habitats.

        "content": "San Bernardino National Forest, California (CNN)At any moment, a plume of smoke could rise from somewhere in California's 33 million acres of forest land. The rugged terrain is often unreachable from the two-lane highways that twist through the thirsty wildland. Several years ago, Pam Morey recalled, one of those plumes filled the skies over Big Bear Lake. Ten minutes later, a second one broke through a couple miles away. A few minutes later, a third appeared.It was an arsonist. But before the fire department got the call, and before anyone in town noticed smoke on the mountain, the first eyewitness was already on the case -- nearly nine miles away.   Perched over 8,000 feet above sea level, a volunteer lookout armed with standard-issue binoculars saw the columns of smoke rising, one by one, in a tidy row. Read MoreThe volunteer spotted the fire from one of the few remaining fire lookout towers in the 823,000-acre San Bernardino National Forest. Here's what you should do if you get trapped by a wildfireAt a time when firefighters make use of cutting-edge equipment like drones, high-powered aircraft and infrared cameras, old-fashioned lookout towers are still an important first line of defense in spotting wildfires. \"Nothing can replace the human eye,\" said Morey, the forest's fire lookout coordinator. The San Bernardino National Forest fire lookout team has spotted 12 fires in the 2018 season alone. They range from car fires, to campfires gone awry, to fires sparked by lightning strikes.      In each case, the fires were called in and extinguished quickly -- before they could grow into one of the raging wildfires that end up on TV. \"They're what I call a $100 fire, versus the $1 million fires, like what you're getting up in Northern California,\" Morey said, referencing the Delta Fire which ripped through 63,293 acres in September 2018.\"We spot those little smokes,\" she said. \"The firefighters go, they get them out, and everyone goes on their way. But any of those could have turned into devastating fires if they weren't caught quickly.\" Vigilant volunteersThe Keller Peak Lookout TowerTwice a month for the past seven years, Tony Arnieri has climbed the 28 steps from the base of Keller Peak to a 14-by-14 foot room at the Keller Peak Lookout Tower. The steps are the home stretch of a 30-mile journey from the nearest freeway, which buzzes 6,572  feet below the mountain.The retired information systems manager travels the last four miles on an isolated, single-lane road peppered with campsites and animal tracks. One way in, and one way out.At the tower, Arnieri proudly opens the door to his \"office\" -- there are spotless windows on all four sides, and a wrap-around porch underneath a billowing flag. On a clear day, a peek through binoculars could yield a glimpse of the Pacific Ocean 100 miles away. But the day always begins with that flag.6 important things to know about wildfires \"We put the flag up first, so we can see what direction the wind is coming from,\" Arnieri said. The wind speed -- coupled with temperature and humidity readings -- sets the tone for the day. Erratic winds, soaring temps and low humidity could mean a busy day for Arnieri, and the volunteers manning the six other towers.He uses an old fashioned wet thermometer and dry bulb, pairing them with a sling psychrometer to record the humidity levels. He logs and broadcasts his findings over a dispatch radio -- connecting his information with fire authorities and forest officials on the ground. He logs occupied campsites and keeps track of expected visitors to the forest, so he is aware in case an emergency happens. But as Arnieri does this, his eyes are on the skies. \"We're constantly checking for smoke,\" he said. \"It's a good day when you don't see a fire.\"Where there's smoke...When the lookouts do spot smoke, the next challenge is to pinpoint the location of the fire.Paul Labarrere has spotted four fires during his 17-year career as fire lookout volunteer. In one instance, he saw smoke 11 miles away from the tower -- which he later learned was a 10-foot by 10-foot fire started by a lightning strike. His accuracy in recording its location, smoke color, and size helped firefighters knock down the blaze before it could turn into a monster.The key is the Osborne Fire Finder, a detailed, circular-shaped map of the forest, marked by each of the 360 degrees, and broken down into quadrants. Designed by a US Forest Service employee in 1915, the device requires no electrical power, and is still used to identify the apex of a blaze. Pam Morey using the Osborne Fire FinderBy turning its base toward the smoke, the lookouts can get an \"azimuth reading,\" which will help determine the distance of the blaze from their location. The lookout will broadcast the mileage and nearby landmarks, so fire crews can scope it out.Labarrere's had one false alarm -- a barbecue -- but Morey stresses the motto on the mountain: it's better to be safe than sorry. Conditions can change on a dime.When lightning hits, Morey said, it can strike a root in the ground, and it will remain there, smoldering. When the sun comes out, the warmth can ignite the root. \"We mark those, and keep an eye on that area. Smoke can travel. It can hit a tree, it can go into the roots ... and come up a couple miles away.\"Fewer eyes in the skyMorey currently oversees 282 volunteer lookouts in the U.S. Forest Service's program. They come from different walks of life -- retired doctors, lawyers, fire chiefs, and teachers. During its heyday, in the 1930s and 1940s, over 5,000 lookout towers peppered the nation's dense forest groves. Fire lookouts were paid, and lived in the towers 24/7. \"They actually had to fight the fires they spotted. They'd jump on their horse, and go put out the flames,\" Morey said.Many of the lookouts were women. In the Angeles National Forest, outside of Los Angeles, a woman named Ramona handled the duties for over 50 years, Morey said. She raised her children on the mountain, living there six to seven months each year. There was no running water, or electricity. In some of the deepest regions of Northern California and Oregon, helicopters dropped off food and water for the lookouts, or they simply lived off the wildlife that crossed their paths. Morey herself used to hike nine miles from the main road in the Angeles National Forest to staff the South Mount Hawkins lookout. She would spend the entire weekend there, by herself, sharing the forest with herds of big-horn sheep. \"I never felt alone, or lonely\" she said.Tony Arineri, left, Pam Morey, center, and Paul Labarrere, rightBy 1964, only 250 active towers remained, according to the US Forest Service. Budget cuts -- combined with the emergence of new technologies -- shuttered the towers.Twenty-two original towers in San Bernardino National Forest were either abandoned or destroyed. In 1993, Morey joined a movement to restore and re-open the buildings which could be salvaged. Seven of them are currently active, and the tight-knit community rallies to keep them open.What it felt like inside the fire tornado that killed a California firefighterYet, some things never change. Volunteers are dazzled by bear and mountain lion sightings.There's still no running water in the towers.To make up for fewer pairs of eyes in the sky, residents and hikers are encouraged to be vigilant. Volunteers sell campfire cookbooks and canteens to raise money for maintenance. The local lumberyard provides wood to replace weather-beaten doors, and the country furniture store donates beds. For these businesses, the lookout towers are instrumental in keeping their livelihoods safe.  The effort has paid off.That string of fires in Big Bear Lake a few years ago turned out to be a group of teenagers, Morey said. Law enforcement blocked off the roads, and waited for the group to emerge.And the fires stopped.But the watchful eyes are constantly on patrol.  \"Once you get into this ... you get into a habit,\" Morey said. \"No matter where you go, you're always looking.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)To celebrate her 29th birthday, Katie Malone strapped into a parasail in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, on June 9 and braced herself for an adventure high above the water. The first few minutes went fine. But at some point in the ride, Malone saw that the boat supposedly pulling her along was going one way and she was flying in the other direction, approaching land. The line connecting them had snapped, she realized.Her terrifying flight ended when Malone crash-landed about 45 minutes later at an airport nearly 2 miles away, her brother Brendan Malone told CNN on Thursday. The crash left her with a broken pelvis, four broken ribs, a collapsed lung, and a blow to the left hand side of her face, he said.But his sister is alive. Read MoreAfter 18 days in a Mexican hospital, Malone returned to the US on Tuesday for more treatment at UCSD Medical Center in San Diego. She has had three surgeries so far, and she remains in the hospital and is doing well, the family said.\"We're moving up and up and she's just doing so strong and so well,\" Brendan Malone said.Katie Malone, 29, broke her pelvis and four ribs in a parasailing crash earlier this month.'She's very lucky to be alive'Despite the injuries, the crash could have been worse for Malone. At one point, she came close to hitting one of the balconies at the resort -- so close that she could hear the people screaming.After the line connecting her to the boat broke, she started traveling down the coast line. From previous skydiving experiences, she knew to use her feet as an anchor, so she grabbed the rope with her feet, put her hands in the air and steered the parasail as best she could with her feet, her brother said.\"She was praying the whole time for her safety. She was mostly concerned about breaking her arms and legs,\" Brendan Malone said. She passed out about 20 minutes in.Even after Malone crash-landed, there were more issues. Her brother said an alligator was by the fence near where she landed, and rescue workers had to scare the beast away to reach her. When family told her about the alligator, Malone says she \"laughed and thought it was hilarious,\" Brendan Malone said.Her family later watched video of the terrifying flight that was filmed by one of her friends.\"I just fell down watching it,\" Malone's mother, Sidona, told CNN sister network HLN. \"It was great to see her though. She's very lucky to be alive and we're really thankful for that.\"US Rep. Duncan D. Hunter and his father, former US Rep. Duncan L. Hunter, helped facilitate Malone's return to the United States.Brendan Malone said his sister was in \"high spirits\" during her time in the Mexican hospital. \"It was unbelievable. Throughout her stay, the doctors and nurses kept asking her what her pain level was -- and she would say 8-10,\" he said. \"When she was ready to get in the ambulance (to start her journey back to the US), the doctors and nurses kept asking her about her pain level. She said she didn't feel any pain at all.\"The family has received offers of help in terms of possible legal action against the parasailing company, according to Brendan Malone.",

        "content": "Riverside, California (CNN)The California husband and wife accused of abusing and chaining most of their 13 children will stand trial.After hours of testimony Wednesday from several law enforcement witnesses, Riverside Superior Court Judge Bernard Schwartz determined Thursday there is enough evidence for David and Louise Turpin to face almost all of the charges brought by prosecutors.The judge dropped one child endangerment charge for the couple's 2-year-old daughter. The Turpins, from Perris, California, will be arraigned August 3. David Turpin, 56, and Louise Turpin, 49, have pleaded not guilty. The Turpins' attorneys refused to comment on Thursday. They each face 12 counts of torture, 12 counts of false imprisonment, eight counts of child abuse and seven counts of abuse of a dependent adult. Read MoreDavid Turpin also faces one count of a lewd act on a child and eight counts of perjury. Louise Turpin faces one count of assault. Prosecutors say the couple beat and tortured 12 of their 13 children, kept them chained to their beds and starved them -- all while the family dogs were kept clean and well-fed.They were arrested on January 14 after their 17-year-old daughter escaped from a window and called 911 on a deactivated cell phone. The Turpins have six minor and seven adult children, ranging in age from 2 years old to 29.\"What we would like the public to know is that our clients are presumed to be innocent, and that's a very important presumption,\" David Macher, a public defender for David Turpin, told reporters in January.Investigators also testified that one child said the house the family lived in smelled so badly she could barely breathe, and she thought she and her 12 siblings might need to go to the doctor.A doctor who treated the family said the 11-year-old girl was in the worst condition when he examined her, testified Patrick Morris, supervising investigator for the Riverside County district attorney's office. She had a body weight percentile of .01 and her mid-arm circumference was equal to that of a 4.5-month-old baby, Morris testified. The doctor said she had psychosocial dwarfism, stunted growth due to living in an environment that is abusive or neglected.",

I don't go out much.\"That chilling 911 call was made public Wednesday as part of a preliminary hearing in the case against David and Louise Turpin, the California couple accused of holding their 13 children captive in a \"house of horrors.\"Louise Turpin, left, and David Turpin, right, sit in court for a preliminary hearing on June 20, 2018.Prosecutors say the couple beat and tortured their children, kept them chained to their beds and starved them -- all while the family dogs were kept clean and well-fed.Read MoreThey were arrested on January 14 after their 17-year-old daughter escaped from a window and called 911 on a deactivated cell phone. The Turpin siblings are comprised of six minors and seven adults, ranging in age from 2 years old to 29.Turpin case: Siblings allegedly starved, shackled and taunted with foodDavid Turpin, 56, and Louise Turpin, 49, pleaded not guilty to more than 40 charges, including torture, false imprisonment, abuse of a dependent adult and child abuse. David Turpin also pleaded not guilty to one count of lewd conduct with a minor.Despite the horror of the 911 call, the girl's voice sounded remarkably calm and clear while relating her experience. But the call, as well as police who responded to the scene, provided several disturbing new details from the home and the degree to which the parents controlled their children's lives. \"I can't breathe because of how dirty the house is,\" the Turpin daughter said on the call. \"We don't take baths. I don't know if we need to go to the doctor.\"Accounts of abuse and starvationOther Turpin children told investigators they were abused. A 14-year-old girl said Louise Turpin threw her down the stairs when she was caught in her mom's room, investigator Brett Rooker of the Riverside County Sheriff's Office testified.\"She said she was terrified of her mother,\" he said.An 11-year-old girl said that Louise Turpin would often punch them with a closed fist and hit her with an open hand, Riverside County Deputy Sheriff Daniel Brown testified. The girl said that sometimes, her mother pulled her hair so forcefully it would lift her off the ground, Brown said.The girl said she was \"always hungry,\" he further testified. The children were fed jalapeno baloney sandwiches while the parents ate Jersey Mike's, pizza and fries, he said. The girl said Louise Turpin would buy apple juice but the children weren't allowed to drink it. She kept pie in the fridge or pantry until it became moldy and then threw it away.A doctor who treated the family said the 11-year-old girl was in the worst condition when the examined her, Patrick Morris, Supervising Investigator for Riverside County District Attorney, testified. She had a body weight percentile of .01 and her mid arm circumference was equal to that of a 4.5-month-old baby, Morris testified. The doctor said she had psychosocial dwarfism, stunted growth due to living in an environment that is abusive or neglected.The 15-year-old boy had difficulty walking, vitamin D deficiency, and visible scoliosis. He told the doctor that he wanted to kill animals and could predict the future, Morris testified.In their room 20 hours a dayJUST WATCHEDDA reveals disturbing details from Turpin family investigationReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHDA reveals disturbing details from Turpin family investigation 01:50The 17-year-old Turpin daughter who made the 911 call weighed about 97 pounds with a BMI of 2.2% when doctors first examined her, Morris said. In other parts of the call, told the operator that her parents were abusive and had chained up two of her sisters, and that she thought her father had guns in the house. She also said she hadn't taken a bath in almost a year.Riverside Deputy Manuel Campos, who responded to the 911 call, testified on Wednesday that the girl appeared much younger than 17. Allegedly held captive for years, Turpin children now 'happy' and Skyping \"She appears not to bathe regularly,\" he also said. \"There was odor emitting from her body of one that doesn't bathe regularly.\"The girl was shaking on the call and \"scared to death\" from the daring escape out of the window, Campos said. She said that she was kept in the room with her sisters for about 20 hours a day, and that she was only allowed to leave the room to eat, use the restroom and brush her teeth, Campos said.If she broke the rules, she would be disciplined in the form of knocking on the head, pulling of hair, or being smacked in the face. After she watched a Justin Bieber video on a cell phone, her mother choked her, she told Campos. In addition to the physical abuse, there was a sexual incident with her father, the girl told police. She said her father pulled her pants down, grabbed her and put her on his lap. She tried to push him away, and pulled her pants up, Campos said. He also tried to force kisses on her mouth, she told Campos, and this happened about 10 times. The girl said her father told her not to tell anyone, Campos said.",

Protesters began to disperse at night, and police made no arrests.After the game, Sacramento Kings owner and chairman Vivek Ranadiv\u00e9 addressed the crowd, joined by the team's players, coaches, front office and executives. \"On Sunday we had a horrific, horrific tragedy in our community,\" Ranadiv\u00e9 said, in reference to the shooting, and conveyed sympathies for the Clark family.

People are anguished,\" he said. \"I understand it and we understand it. I urge our community to remain peaceful.\"The controversial shootingThe incident began on Sunday after 9 p.m., when Sacramento officers responded to a report that a man had broken car windows and was hiding in a backyard. They pursued a man who hopped a fence into the grandmother's property.The shooting was captured by the two officers' body cameras and a police helicopter; that footage was released on Wednesday in an effort to be transparent. Daniel Hahn, who is the first black police chief in Sacramento, told CNN affiliate KCRA that the shooting is \"a tragic event for our entire community, so yes, there's a lot of anger. There's a lot of questions.\"When asked whether releasing the videos increased trust with the police department, he said: \"I have seen some of the conversations change since we've had that video released to the facts of the case, as opposed to filling in the facts because there is a void of facts. I think that's a positive change.\"On Sunday, officers fired 20 times at Clark, hitting him multiple times, police told CNN affiliate KOVR. The two officers have since been placed on paid administrative leave amid a use of force investigation. Stephon Clark was killed Sunday.The body camera videos show the brief encounter between police and Clark, lasting less than a minute, from the moment one of the officers yelled: \"Hey, show me your hands. Stop. Stop.\"Police said the officers entered the front yard and saw the suspect along the side of the home. Police said the man \"turned and advanced toward the officers while holding an object\" extended in front of him. \"Show me your hands!\" one of the officers yelled. \"Gun, gun, gun.\"Seconds later, officers opened fire as they took cover near a wall. As more police arrived at the scene, someone is heard asking, \"What did he have on him?\"An officer responded \"...  something in his hands. It looked like a gun from our perspective.\"Clark's family members have disputed the police account. Clark's grandmother said she was inside the house when the shots were fired, and saw her grandson with an iPhone. Stevante Clark, Stephon's brother, said the two often stayed at their grandmother's house. He said he's \"livid\" with the police right now.

On Thursday, more than 20,000 people in Goleta, Santa Barbara, Summerland and Carpinteria were ordered to evacuate their homes \"out of an abundance of caution,\" Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said.The order also includes Montecito, the community where at least 21 people were killed and two people were never found after mudflows in January. The evacuations were taking place in areas scorched by December's massive Thomas Fire and two other blazes. Mark Olson was outside his home Thursday filling up bags with dirt from January's mudflows. He and some friends were putting the bags around the garage and setting other sacks to funnel water away from his property.Read More\"We're putting all the debris that came down to use,\" he said. \"There's a lot of wishful thinking and hope that somehow this time around it's not as devastating as the last (storm in January).\"The National Weather Service office in Los Angeles said 2 to 3 inches of rain could fall through Saturday. A flash flood watch was scheduled to take effect at 9 p.m. PT for parts of Santa Barbara and Ventura County.The last time the rain came to this area of Southern California, a mudslide walloped through Montecito. As a new storm threatens the area, Laura Ziouani and her family packed, took their dogs and headed to a hotel. \"It's difficult to keep leaving but I think it's the best thing to do,\" Ziouani said.Thursday's evacuation was the third one in the past months and Ziouani said she knows it may not be the last one.\"(It's) frustrating. At the end of the day, you have to do what you have to do,\" she added.Northern California snowSeveral feet of snow and winds are slamming Northern California mountains in what could be the state's biggest storm of the season.A total of 4 to 6 feet of snow is expected for the mountain passes and peaks while up to a foot for foothill locations, the National Weather Service said. Several schools and highways were closed in the Sierra Nevada communities Thursday when snowfall and heavy gusts reduced visibility to near zero levels.Sierra Snowfighters are keeping up with the snow this morning!

When the snow melts, it runs off filling water reservoirs. Recent state snow surveys indicate that so far, the amount of snowfall and levels of water held in the snow have been low, CNN affiliates reported. Last year, the amount of snowfall recorded in Sierra was the lowest in the past three years, CNN affiliate KGO reported.The lack of snow does not necessarily mean a drought might be coming, authorities say.CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.",

David Allen Turpin, 56, and Louise Anna Turpin, 49, were charged Sunday with torture and child endangerment, the Sheriff's Department said. The couple was taken to the Robert Presley Detention Center in Riverside. Bail was set at $9 million for each, the Riverside County Sheriff's Department said. It was not immediately clear if the suspects had attorneys or whether they had entered a plea. The six children -- including the 17-year-old who escaped -- are being treated at Riverside University Health System Medical Center in Moreno Valley. The seven adults are being treated at Corona Regional Medical Center in Corona, authorities said.David and Louise Turpin with their childrenHome listed as a school, state records showDavid Turpin is listed as the principal of the Sandcastle Day School, according to the California Department of Education website. It was operated out of his home, the same nondescript, suburban residence where the 13 victims were found. The day school opened March 21, 2011, and was described as a private school serving grades 1-12.  According to the website, the status of the school is \"active.\"Neighbors said they knew a large family lived there, CNN affiliate KABC reported, but they never saw any of the younger children. One neighbor told the station that she saw the parents being arrested early Sunday. The children were taken from the home in their pajamas, she said. \"They were very, very pale-skinned, almost like they've never seen the sun,\" the neighbor said. \"And it was mostly girls ... kind of small-framed,\" the neighbor said.David and Louise Turpin with the children at one of the couple's vow renewals. Court records: David Turpin had worked as an engineerThe Turpins moved into the Perris home in 2010, public records show.The next year, they filed for bankruptcy in California, according to court records. Ivan Trahan, an attorney who represented the couple at their bankruptcy hearing, told CNN \"there was nothing out of ordinary\" about the couple when he worked with them in 2011. David Turpin made about $140,000 per year working as an engineer at Northrop Grumman, according to the bankruptcy documents. His wife's occupation was listed as \"homemaker.\"They listed about $150,000 in assets, including about $87,000 from 401k plans from Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, according to court papers. The documents listed debts of about $240,000, which included mostly credit card debt and a foreclosed farm in Rio Vista, Texas, valued at $40,000.Trahan said neither of the Turpins seemed upset they were going through bankruptcy.\"They came with a lot of debt. We just knew there was no way they could make their payments,\" Trahan said.The attorney said the couple \"spoke lovingly of their children and even showed me their photos from Disneyland.\" 'This is a highly respectable family,' suspect's mother said.David Turpin's mother, Betty, told CNN the couple usually took vacations with the entire family in tow. They have 13 children, she said, and they usually dressed alike when they went out for safety reasons. \"They were very protective of the kids,\" she said. When they went out, the couple would line the children up according to age, and the parents took their positions at the front and back of the line, she said. \"It was easier to keep up with the kids\" that way, she said.\"This is a highly respectable family,\" she added.A series of videos on social media showed the couple renewing their vows at the Elvis Chapel in Las Vegas, Nevada. They appear to have renewed their vows several times in recent years, in 2011, 2013 and 2015. In the first video, an Elvis Presley impersonator sang \"Love Me Tender\" as he walked a smiling Louise Turpin down the aisle to reaffirm her commitment to her husband after 26 years together. \"I offer you this ring,\" David Turpin said, repeating after the impersonator, \"as a symbol of my love, baby, baby.\" Then, they danced to Presley's \"I Can't Help Falling in Love with You.\" The couple's children joined them for the 2013 and 2015 renewals. In one ceremony, the girls, wearing matching plaid dresses, lead the processional, and the boys, wearing dark suits, stand with their father.An emotional David Turpin can be seen repeating his vows in the video. The children laugh along with the Elvis impersonator, and the couple kisses as their daughters clap.CORRECTION: This story has been updated to give the correct spelling of Northrop Grumman and the correct age for David Turpin, who is 56.CNN's Ray Sanchez, Braden Walker, Amanda Jackson, Artemis Moshtaghian, Stephanie Becker, Cheri Mossburg and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)With more than a half-million Americans being officially diagnosed with Covid-19 every day, the need for clear guidance on isolation and quarantine is critically important. Sadly, the guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is continuously changing, confusing and at times contradictory.Dr. Gerald Harmon, president of the American Medical Association, said in a statement Wednesday that the agency's latest guidance threatens to allow the virus to spread further, putting patients and the health care system at risk.The most recent CDC recommendations also highlight a persistent problem throughout the pandemic: a lack of available testing and a fundamental misunderstanding of how these tests are designed to work. As things stand now, people with Covid-19 are asked to:Stay home for at least five daysRead MoreEnd isolation if symptoms are resolvingWear a mask around others for five more daysTesting at the end of five days of isolation with a rapid antigen test is optional.So what should you do? I suggest a simple and effective strategy that relies on both testing and clinical symptoms, distinguishes between those who are vaccinated or not, and still allows for a rapid return to normal life if you're well.  Let's address the CDC guidance one by one.Stay home for at least five daysFacing criticism, CDC updates Covid-19 isolation recommendations with guidance on testing The chance that you're still infectious drops as time goes on. The longer you stay isolated, the less likely you'll expose someone else to the virus. Ten days after testing positive, the percentage of people still contagious is estimated to be about 5%, according to researchers at the UK Health Security Agency. However, at day five, the end of the CDC isolation period, a significant percentage of people (31%) are still contagious. By day seven, the percentage of people still contagious drops by half -- to about 16%.Ten days after testing positive, the percentage of people still contagious is estimated to be about 5%.End isolation if symptoms are resolvingUnless you've been asymptomatic, this means your symptoms are noticeably better, and importantly, you have been without a fever for 24 hours without taking any fever-reducing medicines, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. It is clear that some symptoms, like fatigue and loss of smell, may last a longer time.Wear a mask around others for five more daysWhile the CDC surprisingly still recommends three ply-cloth masks, many experts say they aren't adequate, especially given how easily Omicron spreads: up to three times faster than Delta, according to recent research from Denmark. Erin Bromage, an associate professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, reminds us that this is primarily an airborne virus and not spread so much by droplets, as happens with flu. Citing data from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, Bromage says a cloth face covering has 75% inward and outward leakage. Compare that with an N95 or KN95, which are excellent at filtering not only large droplets but up to 95% of particles in the air. CDC changes to quarantine, isolation advice took local health officials by surpriseDr. Abraar Karan, an infectious disease fellow at Stanford, once told me that if the American public wore N95 or KN95 masks in public for just four weeks, we could essentially end the pandemic.These masks are now in plentiful supply, and organizations like the nonprofit Project N95 can help you find the right one, while also making sure they are legitimate.Optional rapid antigen test around day fiveThe CDC's latest guidance says a person in isolation can take an antigen test toward the end of the five-day isolation period, if they have access to a test and want to take one.Making these tests optional has been the largest source of confusion in the new guidelines. It undermines their value for identifying when you're contagious and doesn't seem to consider all the evidence. Biden administration launching additional testing sites in six states\"With hundreds of thousands of new cases daily and more than a million positive reported cases on January 3, tens of thousands -- potentially hundreds of thousands of people -- could return to work and school infectious if they follow the CDC's new guidance on ending isolation after five days without a negative test,\" warned Harmon, the AMA president.  \"A negative test should be required for ending isolation after one tests positive for COVID-19. Reemerging without knowing one's status unnecessarily risks further transmission of the virus.\"So what should the clearest and most evidence-based isolation guidance look like? Given the paucity of tests, it would be both a test-based and symptoms-based policy that reflects the real-world data on someone's level of contagiousness at any given time. It would also consider the person's vaccination status.Consider this approach we have decided to take at my home institution, Emory Healthcare, where I am a practicing neurosurgeon. Employees who are vaccinated can end isolation:At day 5, if an antigen test is negative and symptoms are resolving, (including no fever for 24 hours -- off of fever reducing medicines like acetaminophen)Or at day 7, if symptoms are resolving; no test is requiredEmployees who are unvaccinated can end isolation:At day 7, if an antigen test is negative and symptoms are resolving, (including no fever for 24 hours -- off of fever reducing medicines like acetaminophen)Or at day 10, if symptoms are resolving; no test is requiredWhile it is true that vaccinated people may at times be as contagious as unvaccinated, there are two important points to remember:The vaccinated are five times less likely to become infected in the first place. If a vaccinated person does become infected, the length of time they are contagious is shorter.  It should go without saying that if you are sick, you should stay home, no matter what day you're on. These rapid antigen tests are most useful in people who have Covid-19 or have been recently exposed but feel fine, which describes many of the people currently isolating or under quarantine.There's one crucial step to your Covid self-test you may be missing, experts sayBut the CDC has unfortunately minimized the value of these rapid antigen tests by making them optional. Dr. Thomas Tsai of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health says the ideal strategy would be to use these rapid tests every day, which can eliminate a lot of the guesswork.\"We're relying on the symptoms to point to how infectious you are, versus data from antigen tests to say if you're infectious or not, regardless of your symptoms,\" Tsai said.A single antigen test might not be ironclad, but using them serially over a few days boosts their value even more. It is a strategy that is already working to keep some kids in school instead of quarantining them after they've had contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19. The reason rapid antigen tests are often discounted is because they might return a negative result at the same time a PCR test is positive. Most PCR tests take longer and require a lab; they're highly sensitive and able to detect the presence of the virus' genetic material long after someone is no longer contagious. Rapid antigen tests can be performed at home and detect certain proteins from the virus, when the viral load is high enough.The tests are fundamentally answering two different questions. PCR: Do I have any presence of virus or viral remnants? Rapid antigen: Am I contagious? Dr. Rochelle Walensky acknowledged this back in the summer of 2020, before she was director of the CDC.The differences in the tests seem like a subtle point, but it's an important distinction. Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Resolutions for making 2022 a better, healthier yearIf antigen tests were ubiquitous, everyone could test themselves regularly in the morning, and know whether they were presently contagious and whether they should continue to isolate. The real problem with this strategy, however, is an incredibly frustrating one: Two years into this pandemic, these tests are still difficult to find. I, along with other experts like Tsai and epidemiologist Dr. Michael Mina, have been calling for more tests from the start of the pandemic. In fact, when looking back at our reporting from the past two years, I've talked about the need for increased testing more than 650 times.Yet here we are.I think Tsai describes America's relationship with testing the best: \"It's always documented the course of the pandemic as opposed to altering the course.\"The Biden administration is attempting to course-correct, pledging to make 500 million home tests available for the public for free. However, we still have only assurances that they are on their way.Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\"Deliveries of tests from manufacturers to the US government will begin over the next week or so. Americans will start receiving free tests in the coming weeks,\" said White House Covid-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients during a briefing Wednesday.But for those who needed them before the holidays and need them right now, we are only hearing story after story of waiting hours to get tested or going on a treasure hunt to hopefully find them in stores. And the cost adds up as well: now about $20 for a two-pack.If you have Covid-19, it's worth decreasing the risk of spreading it by really thinking about how you're going to come out of isolation. I support a strategy that considers your symptoms, your vaccination status, testing and the best data on your contagiousness at any given time. I am confident that 2022 will be a year of promise and renewal and that we will get through this together. While Covid-19 is likely here to stay, these simple strategies can help accelerate the end of the pandemic.",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)Supporters of then-President Donald Trump brought dozens of weapons to Washington on the day of the insurrection, according to the Justice Department, undermining claims from at least one Republican senator who said the attack wasn't an \"armed insurrection,\" according to a CNN review of court records. Some of the weapons that were confiscated had been seen being used inside the US Capitol including a baseball bat, a fire extinguisher, a wooden club, a spear, crutches, a flagpole, bear spray, mace, chemical irritants, stolen police shields, a wooden beam, a hockey stick, a stun gun, and knives. Many of these weapons were used to attack police officers who were protecting the Capitol. In this photo submitted in court filings by the Department of Justice, a rioter throws a sharpened pole at Capitol Police Officers.One leading theory into the death of Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick is that the suspects sprayed an irritant, perhaps bear spray, that caused Sicknick to suffer a fatal reaction, a US official told CNN.  Federal investigators are narrowing their suspects in the murder probe. The hand-to-hand combat sent more than a dozen officers to the hospital, including some who sustained concussions and bone fractures. The former chief of the US Capitol Police said his officers fought off the armed crowd for about an hour before the rioters overpowered the police lines. Read MoreSen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, made waves this week after downplaying the attack that killed five people and injured more than 100 police officers. In addition, two officers died by suicide in the days after the insurrection. Photo submitted in court filings by the Department of Justice.In an interview with a Milwaukee radio station, Johnson condemned the assault on the Capitol and said it was \"reprehensible and never should have happened.\" But then he claimed that \"edited\" videos made the situation look worse than it was, and seemingly defended the violent mob.  \"This didn't seem like an armed insurrection to me,\" Johnson said in an interview with WISN in Milwaukee. \"When you hear the word 'armed,' don't you think of firearms? Here's the questions I would have liked to ask: How many firearms were confiscated? How many shots were fired?\" Police said they found a gun on Christopher Alberts while he was exiting the Capitol. The Maryland native tried to flee but was restrained by officers, who also found 25 rounds of ammunition, according to court documents. Alberts allegedly told police he had the gun for \"personal protection,\" and he hasn't yet entered a plea, according to court records. Other Trump supporters who came to Washington but didn't enter the Capitol were discovered with a wide array of extremely dangerous weapons, according to the CNN review. This photo from court filings by the DOJ, shows eleven mason jars and related items were parts designed to create a Molotov cocktails, a dangerous incendiary explosive, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms concluded.Lonnie Coffman of Alabama was arrested near the Capitol shortly before the attack and was found with what one judge called a \"small armory\" in his truck. Investigators discovered three  guns, 11 Molotov cocktails, a crossbow with bolts, smoke bombs and a stun gun, according to court documents. Coffman, 70, pleaded not guilty last month to a 17-count criminal indictment.

The FBI said the bombs were real but didn't go off, and they have increased the cash reward for information about the bomber.

        "content": "Seoul (CNN)Ten years ago, the world watched as a young Kim Jong Un solemnly walked beside his father's hearse on a snowy morning in Pyongyang as distraught North Koreans wailed in grief.Kim's long black coat and hairstyle, reminiscent of his late grandfather Kim Il Sung, were viewed as a superficial effort to emulate the authority of his forebears. But the 20-something heir to the North Korean leadership quickly grew into the role, and Korea watchers who were once skeptical of his rule now expect him to remain in power indefinitely -- assuming his health holds.It's a marked change from the early days, when Joseph Yun, former US special representative for North Korea, remembers Kim as an object of ridicule. \"For a while, there was so much negative caricature of Kim Jong Un in South Korea and in China, almost making fun of him. It was very difficult for the international public -- South Korea and America -- to take him seriously,\" he recalled.Read MoreThat view quickly changed as the young Kim displayed a ruthlessness and decisiveness that belied his age.Kim Jong Un salutes beside his father's hearse during his funeral procession in Pyongyang on December 28, 2011.Kim did not hesitate to purge or execute even those closest to him in a bid to tighten his grip on power. His powerful uncle Jang Song Thaek, once presumed to be Kim's mentor, was executed in 2013 for \"trying to overthrow the government,\" according to a state media report. And, Kim's older half-brother Kim Jong Nam, was assassinated with the nerve agent VX at Kuala Lumpur airport in Malaysia in 2017 while living in exile, though North Korea denied any responsibility for the brazen assassination.  Now, few question Kim's authority, but some experts worry that his consolidated power could embolden him to take greater risks -- and that, as Covid drives North Korea to become more isolationist, its leader will only become more dangerous. Kim Jong Il's funeral procession drives through Pyongyang on December 28, 2011.The making of a leader Kim Jong Un made his first public speech on the centennial of his grandfather Kim Il Sung's birth in April 2012 -- one of the most important dates in North Korea's calendar. It was a marked departure from the style of his father Kim Jong Il, whose voice was barely heard in public.The young leader stood at the podium switching his weight from one foot to another like a schoolboy might do, as he delivered a speech promising to uphold his father's dying wishes to build a strong socialist country.Less than one year later, in February 2013, Kim Jong Un conducted his first nuclear test -- the third in North Korea's history -- a provocative move interpreted as Kim's message to the world, specifically to the US, that he was to be taken seriously. Around the same time, Kim announced his \"Pyongjin\" policy to simultaneously develop its nuclear program as well as the economy.Over the next few years, North Korea dedicated itself to developing its military capabilities, not limited to intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Various short and medium range missiles were also tested, and three more underground nuclear explosions were detonated. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un waves from a balcony following a military parade in Pyongyang on April 15, 2017. \"The diversification we're seeing in North Korea is puzzling considering the constrained resources in the country,\" said Ankit Panda, Stanton Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"What we see is really more than 10, around 15, potential nuclear delivery systems under development. It's really remarkable.\" Beyond developing the country's military, Kim has also achieved a diplomatic victory that neither his father nor his grandfather could achieve in their much longer rules -- a summit with a sitting American President.Kim met then US President Donald Trump in Singapore in 2018 in a meeting billed as opportunity to forge new relations between the nations. During his trip, Kim walked freely around downtown Singapore waving at people, something that would have been unthinkable for his father or grandfather whose public appearances were always meticulously managed.Yun said that Kim's meeting with Trump signified that he was \"coming out, establishing himself that he was a regional leader that has a place in this scene.\"Kim Jong Un met then US President Trump in Singapore on June 12, 2018. A series of summits with world leaders, including Trump, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin and South Korean President Moon Jae-In, produced few tangible outcomes and made little progress on resolving North Korea's nuclear issue, but they raised the global profile of both Kim Jong Un and North Korea.  The creation of KimjongunismBy the time Kim was endorsed as \"General Secretary\" at the 8th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea in January, portraits of his father and grandfather had been removed from walls of the venue, according to images of the event published by state media.Experts and South Korea's Unification Ministry see their removal as a sign that Kim is reaching the level of his predecessors.      South Korea's spy agency briefed the country's lawmakers that North Korea has begun using the neologism \"Kimjongunism\" internally. Reports about Kim's excellence, even to the level of idolization, have emerged in state media.  This month, the regime's Central News Agency (KCNA) described Kim as \"the outstanding teacher brightly indicating the path... with his unique ideological and theoretical wisdom.\" Cheong Seong-chang, director of Center for North Korean Studies at the Sejong Institute, sees these reports are a deliberate strategy by North Korea to differentiate Kimjongunism from the ideologies of Kim Jong Il and Kim Il Sung. He says Kimjongunism prioritizes people, unlike his father who placed military development above all else. Kim's policies also call for patriotism and the building of the North Korean state, a departure from his grandfather's ambitions for a socialist state lifted by a collective desire for self-sufficiency. Duyeon Kim, Adjunct Senior Fellow at the Center for a New American Security, says Kim seems to be trying to chart his own path. \"He certainly seems to be trying to come out of the shadows of his father and grandfather and bring all the attention on him,\" she says.Kim Jong Un has emerged as a leader in his own right.But this is not a unique move by Kim Jong Un, according to Cheong. He says Kim's grandfather, who had unconditionally accepted Marxism-Leninism early in his rule, moved toward pursuing his own independent line in his 10th year, and Kim Jong Il began promoting his ideology alongside the Juche or self-reliance ideology of Kim Il Sung in 1985, 11 years after he took power. But unlike his predecessors, who had painted the picture of a paradise on Earth and did not acknowledge any shortcomings, Kim has been willing to admit to areas for improvement such as the nation's \"tense\" food situation.  The next decade will be crucial for Kimjongunism as Kim seeks to fulfill his promise to improve people's lives despite being constrained by strict international sanctions. Unlike his predecessors, Kim has encouraged a mix of a market economy -- which allows people to make profit -- with a planned economy that caps individual gain. However, the unexpected global pandemic may be the biggest challenge in the pursuit of Kimjongunism. North Korea's borders have been shut for nearly two years since the beginning of the pandemic, blocking almost all trade and humanitarian aid. North Korea has a chronic food shortage of about one million tons every year, according to the South Korean government. South Korea's Unification Ministry has said that some food related items are showing \"a steep rise\" in price and \"the volatility of food and daily necessities overall is increasing as the border closure situation prolongs.\"\"The biggest difficulty North Korea is facing now is that even North Korea does not know how long this isolation will last,\" said Cheong.North Korea unveiled what analysts believe to be the world's largest liquid-fueled intercontinental ballistic missile at a parade in Pyongyang on October 10, 2020.What does this mean for the world? North Korea hasn't tested any missiles since this October. But this hiatus should not be mistaken for a change of North Korea's strategy -- it may mean the opposite, experts say.Some experts believe the pause may be linked to China's important agenda next year -- the Beijing Winter Olympics and the 2022 Communist Party Congress. \"China doesn't want any mess before the Beijing Olympics nor an unstable situation on the Korean Peninsula before their own congress, so I think that's a key reason why North Korea has not done any missile testing or nuclear testing because it would tremendously displease China,\" says Yun, the former US special representative for North Korea.It's expected North Korea will continue to work on plans laid out by Kim this January, including developing tactical nuclear weapons, hypersonic missiles, a solid-fueled ICBM, a nuclear-powered submarine and underwater-launch nuclear strategic weapons. And there are signs the country is ramping up its nuclear program while talks with the US remain stalled. Activity appears to have resumed at a reactor at its main nuclear complex in Yongbyon, which appeared to have been shut down since December 2018, according to reports from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and others. \"Historically, the development of the DPRK's nuclear and ballistic missile programs have accelerated during periods when the country was not bound by any agreement with -- or involving -- the US to constrain the country's WMD programs,\" says Laura Rockwood, director of Open Nuclear Network, and former section head for Non-Proliferation and Policy Making at the IAEA.  North Korean soldiers ride atop armored vehicles during a military parade in Pyongyang on October 10, 2015.  While Trump agreed to the Singapore summit with few strings attached, US policy towards North Korea has generally insisted on the precondition that North Korea commits to denuclearization. However, Rockwood adds it would be more productive to engage in negotiations with North Korea with the view to arms control as a first step, before any progression to potential denuclearization.Unfortunately, North Korea is not at the top of the agenda in Washington at the moment.The seemingly stable situation of the regime under Kim's strong grip on power could lead the Biden administration to think that it can focus on other, more imminent issues in the region, China and Taiwan. But experts warn of the consequences of not engaging with the North more actively, as it continues to build its weapons capability.\"The challenge for North Korea is growing month by month, year by year, and the challenge we'll be facing five years down the line is going to be significantly different,\" says Panda, from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.One thing seems increasingly certain and that is Kim looks set to be around for a while, as a confident leader and as a tougher dictator to deal with for the world.\"As long as his physical health holds up, I think he's in it for the next few decades,\" says Duyeon Kim, from the Center for a New American Security. \"And so this is where the long game really is important for us to remember -- that even if North Korea does not make big strides in achieving its goals immediately or in the mid-term, North Korea has always been resilient even in the harshest of economic times.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Five-year-old Su Htet Waing often wakes up crying for her mother and older sister.  Hiding in the mosquito-infested jungles of Myanmar in a makeshift tent with her father, her young world has been torn apart.  \"I want to sleep with mummy, but the police have taken her,\" she said in an audio clip recorded by her father, Soe Htay, on his phone and sent to CNN in early August. Soe Htay was one of the early leaders of the pro-democracy movement against the military which overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government in a coup in February.  He says his family is now paying the price for his activism. His wife and teenage daughter remain behind bars, and his youngest daughter says she was forced into a half sitting, half standing pose during the 18 days she was in detention -- a stress position that the United Nations Committee Against Torture views as a form of torture. Read MoreThe military has not responded to CNN's detailed emails and texts about the girl's detention and treatment.Soe Htay, left, and his daughter Su Htet Waing. But Soe Htay and his daughter are not alone.  In the months since the coup, the junta has waged a bloody campaign against its opponents, shooting dead protesters in the street and detaining thousands of doctors, activists, journalists, artists -- anyone it deems an enemy.  Sometimes, the junta isn't able to find its opponents. And increasingly, the military is going after another group of people to sow fear among the population and make them fall in line: the family members of dissidents, according to Tom Andrews, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar.  \"It's just horrific, it's horrific, it's outrageous, it's completely unacceptable and the international community should be up in arms,\" he said. \"That's the brutal reality we're facing in this country and most importantly that the people of the Myanmar are facing.\" Cracking down on protests After the military took over, Soe Htay took to the streets in protest. And, like thousands of others in the country opposed to the takeover, Soe Htay became a target of the military junta.   In June, months after he had stopped protesting for fear of being shot by the military, soldiers came to his home in Myanmar's central Mogok city to arrest him, Soe Htay told CNN from his jungle hideout.  They raided his house four times, but he had already gone into hiding with his two sons, he said, leaving his immediate family behind. On the final visit in June, they arrested his wife and two daughters instead. \"This is a hostage-arrest,\" he said. \"Since they arrested my family when they couldn't arrest me ... my youngest daughter wasn't even 5 yet.\"  Su Htet Waing spent 18 days in detention. Su Htet Waing spent her fifth birthday in detention, said Soe Htay. She was let out on June 30 after 18 days as part of a mass prisoner release. Her mother and sister remain behind bars, sentenced to three years in prison, Soe Htay said. Local media reported the pair were charged with incitement -- a common punishment leveled at pro-democracy activists. While Su Htet Waing was detained she was forced into the half-sitting, half-standing position, which caused her \"mental trauma,\" said Soe Htay.  Andrews, the UN special rapporteur, said he has heard of many similar cases of children being brutally punished for the political views of their parents in the months since the military junta took control.  \"The stress position is outrageous,\" he said.\"I have seen reports of children being beaten, reports of children, of iron rods burning their legs, I've seen them detained for several days ... I'm speechless and outraged and truly angry at what despicable behavior we're seeing.\" The United Nations Committee Against Torture views stress positions as contrary to the Convention Against Torture.  Innocent hostages Khaing Zin Thaw also tried to fight against the junta -- and like Soe Htay, it's her family that is paying the price.  Khaing Zin Thaw's parents were arrested in April. She says they haven't done anything wrong. The 21-year-old used her role as a social media influencer to raise money for the Civil Disobedience Movement, which saw thousands of people leave their jobs to destabilize the coup and economy. She helped collect donations for those who had lost their jobs and were struggling to get by. Khaing Zin Thaw also made posts supporting the movement on Facebook, where she has about 700,000 followers. But that soon put her onto the radar of the military. Shortly after February's coup, she left home for safety and has been moving constantly ever since within Myanmar. But in April she got an alarming phone call.  \"One of my friends called me and told me there were military trucks outside my house. They called back half an hour later and said your parents have been arrested,\" she said. Her parents have done nothing wrong, she said, her voice wavering. Her father does not even know how to use Facebook.  Her sister-in-law was also taken in her place, Khaing Zin Thaw said, but has since been released.  \"I heard that my father has been tortured and has not asked for his medication ... sometimes, my mind goes blank and I feel like I am losing my mind,\" she said, adding that both her parents have been charged with incitement. The military has not responded to CNN's detailed requests for comment. Taking 'hostages' At least 182 people, including children, have been detained in place of their family members since the coup -- and 141 of them remain in detention, according to advocacy group Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP). The group characterizes these arrests as hostage taking, and stresses the military's actions are in violation of international law. Myanmar town near India border sees exodus as thousands flee fightingAccording to AAPP, when children are taken into detention, they are not sent to prisons, such as the notorious Insein where thousands of pro-democracy protesters are held. Instead, they are sent to interrogation centers, police custody, military barracks or junta administration offices.  \"The children who are detained as hostage are placed in the same cells as their family. But exact details inside detention are difficult to confirm,\" AAPP said in a written interview. \"As far as we know, hostages are not being mixed with other pro-democracy detentions.\" AAPP said because the junta is making this distinction, it \"clearly understands what it is doing is hostage taking.\" The group warns the practice is likely to increase. Myanmar has been brought to the edge of collapse since the coup, with the junta waging a bloody campaign against nationwide protests and strikes.  The economy is in tatters, and a deadly Covid-19 wave is devastating the nation. Civilian insurgencies in the cities and border regions have declared a people's war on the military, with local militias carrying out guerrilla-style attacks on military forces. \"(Hostage taking) is a strategy by the junta to inflict 'worry', it is part of the junta's wider campaign of terror waged against the population,\" the group said. \"(It) will only get worse as the junta is increasingly losing on the front lines, with attacks in the cities like Yangon and Mandalay also escalating.\" The future The practice of detaining relatives is aimed at suppressing dissent, but it doesn't appear to be working.  Far away from her happy childhood at their family home, little Su Htet Waing spends her days with her father, exposed to Myanmar's monsoon season, mosquitoes, and the risk of disease.  Su Htet Waing is in hiding in Myanmar's jungles. Soe Htay says he believes the military is still hunting for him so he has to stay in a makeshift tent in the jungle. His daughter has her backpack ready in case they have to run again. He is determined to continue the fight for democracy in any way he can, despite his seemingly desperate situation. Soe Htay has been told by friends in the pro-democracy movement, who trickle information out of the prisons and during prisoner releases, that his daughter and wife were separated since their sentencing.  He's also been told his daughter caught Covid-19, but has since recovered.  \"The way I see it,\" he said. \"Their sorrow will only be healed after the revolution ... my only thought is to root out the dictatorship, for now I have to bury my bitterness and hatred in the revolution.\"  Khaing Zin Thaw said she is now in \"a safe place\" but has to continue moving for fear of being tracked down by the military. \"I am sad and dejected, and I am frustrated as I can't do anything for my parents in jail,\" she said.",

        "content": "(CNN)The stark divide between Republicans and Democrats has mirrored divisions among Americans for many years, but political observers have likened this current period to the Civil War era.For a time, that seemed like an exaggeration -- but not after January 6.Consider two images from the insurrection. One, a White man with a Confederate flag, a symbol of White terror, slung casually over his shoulder standing in the Capitol building. The other, a week after the insurrection, Black national guardsmen in that same building, gathered around Rosa Parks in bronze, sitting primly, yet defiantly in opposition to our American caste system.As detailed in \"Lincoln: Divided We Stand,\" CNN's six-part Original Series that debuts Sunday, it is those two competing impulses -- advancing White dominance and advocating Black citizenship -- that shaped the decades leading up to Abraham Lincoln's election, the American Civil War that followed and Lincoln's assassination.Indeed, it was what John Wilkes Booth called Lincoln's promise of \"n* citizenship\" that drove him to his final breaking point. It is necessary that we consider Lincoln to understand how we got here.Read MoreLauded as The Great Emancipator, the presence of 4 million black Americans was complicated for the 16th US President. More than 150 years after he was shot dead and elevated to martyr status, the presence of over 40 million African Americans, 60 million Hispanics and over 20 million Asian Americans is complicated for many White Americans.Consider 2045.That's the year when America will be a very different country. White Americans will cease to be the majority.\"New census population projections confirm the importance of racial minorities as the primary demographic engine of the nation's future growth, countering an aging, slow-growing and soon to be declining white population,\" wrote William Frey in a report for Brookings. \"During that year, whites will compromise 49.7% of the population in contrast to 24.6 percent for Hispanics, 13.1% for Blacks, 7.9 % for Asians, and 3.8% for multiracial populations.\"This is the backdrop for understanding this current moment and the decades ahead. It is key to understanding Donald Trump's nostalgia-fueled 2016 run, with its racist rhetoric and embrace of a kind of toxic masculinity. The former President, like so many before him, offered himself up as the only person standing in the way of the onslaught of otherness that threatened to change the country and make America unrecognizable. That change so visible in the most diverse Congress ever, the most diverse Cabinet ever, including Vice President Kamala Harris. And the power of this new America was made visible in Georgia, decimated in the Civil War, and now represented for the first time in the US Senate by an African American and a Jewish man.As Georgians and other Americans celebrated this milestone, an angry crowd of White Americans gathered in Washington, DC, to try to disenfranchise millions of voters in that state and several others.\"Lincoln certainly would acknowledge how far we have come because we really have, but we're not there. We're definitely not there,\" said Edna Greene Medford, a professor of history at Howard University, in the CNN series. \"And in recent times it seems we are going backwards. I think Lincoln would be most disappointed in what we have not accomplished.\"Observers noted that during the Civil War, the traitors' flag never made it to the Capitol like it did on January 6. (A noose was also set up).But, of course, the ideology that flag represented and the leaders who followed it, did. The statue of Parks, the first life-size statue of a Black woman in the Capitol, sits under the gaze of Jefferson Davis.\"It's important for us to recognize the way that the forces of inequality have reconfigured themselves to fit in a country that is supposed to be defined by justice,\" said Christopher Bonner, a historian who appears in the docuseries. \"The problems have old roots but new forms.\"The question before the country is similar to what Lincoln faced. How to make and keep America a multiracial democracy? Lincoln began to imagine that America in the last speech of his life. He was killed four days later, and his dreams for Reconstruction were thwarted by white mob violence that ruled well into the 20th century.What gets lost in the lionization of Lincoln as America's greatest President, is that he evolved on matters of race and Black citizenship. He was deeply anti-Black, wanted to contain, but not eradicate slavery. He was a White supremacist who believed Black people were inferior and would be better off going back to Africa.Yet, by the end of the Civil War, with 700,000 dead he had evolved to see (certain) Black people as worthy of the ballot. It'll take an even more expansive imagination, and more founding mothers like Rosa Parks, for America to move toward an inclusive multiracial democracy and a new founding.CNN Original Series \"Lincoln: Divided We Stand\" premieres Sunday at 10 p.m. ET/PT.",

        "content": "(CNN)Don't call Rep. Jim Clyburn a member of President-elect Joe Biden's inner circle. Yes, with his pivotal endorsement of Biden in the South Carolina primary, he helped the President-elect secure the Democratic nomination. And yes, every two days or so, Clyburn's phone rings and it's Biden on the line. And, in fact, in one of those calls, Clyburn cautioned Biden against having an inner circle that wasn't diverse enough, an observation that maybe only someone who doesn't care about being in the inner circle could make. \"I've been a sounding board for him, he's made it very clear -- 'I need to bounce something off of you,' \" Clyburn, the third-ranking Democrat in the House, said in an interview with CNN last week. \"And I've called him and said, 'I need to offer a bit of advice.' \"That advice has helped shape the Cabinet, which will be one of the most diverse in history, with Biden's announcement of his attorney general pick expected in the coming days.Clyburn, along with other civil rights leaders, has urged Biden to pick an attorney general who understands how critical criminal justice reform is. For the South Carolina Democrat, race is less of an issue for the attorney general pick -- the lineup of finalists includes Judge Merrick Garland, Alabama Sen. Doug Jones and former acting Attorney General Sally Yates.  Read MoreHe publicly criticized Biden after the rollout of his national security team, concerned that the first impression suggested that diversity wasn't a top concern. Clyburn said he was getting calls from all over the country, even as the incoming administration said that there were more picks to come.  Among the diverse Cabinet choices are Rep. Marcia Fudge of Ohio, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, for Housing and Urban Development; Michael Regan, who runs the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, for the Environmental Protection Agency; and Linda Thomas-Greenfield as US ambassador to the United Nations. Biden TransitionBiden receives first dose of Covid-19 vaccineBiden poised to nominate Connecticut education chief Miguel Cardona as education secretaryHere's which Biden Cabinet and other top roles haven't been announced yetMAP: Full presidential election results \"I'm pretty satisfied. In the top four we are at 25% with General (Lloyd) Austin,\" he said of Biden's pick for Secretary of Defense, whom he spoke with a few days before the nomination was rolled out. Austin would require a congressional waiver to be confirmed for the civilian post because he only retired from active-duty service four years ago, less than the seven mandated by federal law. Ensuring that Austin's nomination isn't stymied by Democrats voting against a waiver for him to serve as the first Black Secretary of Defense is now part of Clyburn's portfolio.  \"For anybody on my side of the aisle who said, 'I voted for you but I said at the time I was not going to do it again,' \" he says, \"'Well, maybe you ain't gonna do it again for a Republican, but do it the first time for a Democrat because you already done it for Republicans.'\" In the Senate, 16 Democrats voted against granting President Donald Trump's first Defense Department nominee, Ret. Marine Corps Gen. Jim Mattis, a waiver for the position in 2017. In the House, 150 Democrats voted to deny Mattis a waiver and a handful have signaled they find Biden's choice problematic for the same reason. Clyburn's sway with the vocal and growing caucus of young progressives in the House is questionable. In the back-and-forth between moderates and progressives over whether activists' \"defund the police\" slogan cost Democrats seats in the House this year, Clyburn -- first elected in 1992 -- is firmly in the moderate camp. Still, he takes offense if anyone questions his progressive bonafides.\"Remember, I met my wife in jail, challenging the status quo,\" Clyburn said of his 1960 arrest after a sit-in. \"I've been in jail more than once challenging the status quo. I'm as progressive as anyone, but I am also realistic about the politics in this country.\" Clyburn said it was his wife's realism and pragmatism about the country's politics that led her to pick Biden. Five months after his wife, Emily, died, Clyburn endorsed Biden.\"I know Joe. We know Joe. But most importantly, Joe knows us,\" he said three days before the South Carolina primary. Biden handily won the primary and racked up big wins in the days after, effectively clinching the nomination. Clyburn, who is the highest-ranking African American in Congress, said his relationship with Biden, who he has known for years, has grown closer over the last months.  \"More than anything, I would say their relationship is genuine and frank,\" said Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, who will join Biden's administration as a senior adviser and director of the Office of Public Engagement. \"They are very similar but a lot of times Clyburn can put a different perspective on issues. They are a good team.\"  While Clyburn, 80, typically referred to the President-elect, 78, using honorifics or his full name, he said \"Joe\" comes more easily to him now.  \"That's a sign of our evolving relationship, I guess. Someone asked me the other day, 'What is y'all's relationship?' \" Clyburn recalled. \"I said, well, I guess he is like a younger brother.\"",

        "content": "Charleston, South Carolina  (CNN)Tuesday night's debate was a frenetic free-for-all, with six candidates all trying to knock Democratic presidential front-runner Bernie Sanders off the course of claiming the party's nomination. But a series of narrower fights might have mattered even more, as everyone in the field vies to emerge as the lone challenger to Sanders with time running out: South Carolina's primary is Saturday and Super Tuesday, when 14 states and American Samoa vote, is three days later.Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's approach was clearest: precise, selective swings at Sanders; damn the torpedoes against former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Former Vice President Joe Biden and billionaire businessman Tom Steyer fought over their records on race, courting a much narrower audience: the African American voters who will make up more than half the electorate in South Carolina. Visit CNN's Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 raceRead MoreAmong Biden's competitors in the moderate lane, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg tried to hammer Sanders all night -- talking over his answers repeatedly in his most aggressive debate performance yet. And Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar stayed above the fray, instead offering herself as an above-it-all alternative to the food fight viewers were watching. Here are eight takeaways from the 10th Democratic presidential debate Tuesday night in Charleston: Sanders gets front-runner treatmentDemocratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) speaks during the Democratic presidential primary debate at the Charleston Gaillard Center on February 25, 2020 in Charleston, South Carolina. Warren set the tone. Bloomberg followed, then Buttigieg, then Biden.By the end of the first half-hour, everyone onstage had taken a whack at Sanders. Their aim was clear: knock him off his pedestal.Whether they hit the mark is another question.Bloomberg said Sanders was a weak general election candidate, which is why \"Russia is trying to get (him) elected.\" Warren accused Sanders' team of \"trashing\" her over her plan to pay for \"Medicare for All.\" Buttigieg scoffed at Sanders' calls for political revolution when -- in refusing to blow up the Senate filibuster --  he won't make \"a rule change.\" Biden again slammed Sanders over his votes against the Brady Act, which mandated a waiting period on handgun purchases.Sanders was also put on the defensive by the moderators, who questioned his past support for legislation that protects gun manufacturers from lawsuits, his comments -- recently and going back decades -- about Cuba and whether he was sufficiently pro-Israel.In front of an audience that didn't cheer even for his most reliable applause lines, Sanders stuck to the message that has been core to his campaign. There were missteps, but for rivals desperate to change the trajectory of the race, the knockout blow never came.Biden, Steyer fight for black votersDemocratic presidential candidates former Vice President Joe Biden (L) and Tom Steyer (R) debate as Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) reacts during the Democratic presidential primary debate at the Charleston Gaillard Center on February 25, 2020 in Charleston, South Carolina. In Saturday's primary in South Carolina, the most important constituency is African-American voters, who make up more than half the electorate and who Biden has called his \"firewall\" of support. That reality turned the debate into a brawl between Biden and Steyer, who has made significant inroads with black voters after focusing his campaign on South Carolina more than any other state. Biden lambasted Steyer for investing in private prisons. \"They hogtied young men in prison here in this state. They in fact made sure that in Georgia they did not have health care for the people that were being held,\" Biden said. \"You wrote the crime bill,\" Steyer shot back, referencing the 1994 legislation signed into law by former President Bill Clinton and noting that it had imposed stiff mandatory minimum sentences that had left hundreds of thousands of black and brown people in jail. Steyer then talked about all the efforts he has made to end the private prison system in California and address systemic racism in the criminal justice system. \"Tommy come lately,\" Biden quipped. Warren offers herself as the safer version of SandersDemocratic presidential candidates (L-R) Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) raise their hands during the Democratic presidential primary debate at the Charleston Gaillard Center on February 25, 2020 in Charleston, South Carolina. Warren has been quietly chipping away at Sanders for weeks. On Tuesday night, she showed her hand early on.After talking up the Democratic Party's progressive wing and its goals, sprinkling in some praise for Sanders, she began to explain why she was the better bet to turn those ideas into reality.  She was most pointed on their shared support for Medicare for All, the bill Sanders famously wrote and Warren, after backing it, first put out a plan to finance, then said she would implement in two separate stages.\"Bernie and I both want to see universal health care, but Bernie's plan doesn't explain how to get there. Doesn't show how we're going to get enough allies into it and doesn't show enough about how we're going to pay for it,\" Warren said.   After she \"dug in\" and offered the pay-for plan, Warren added, \"Bernie's team trashed me for it.\"Her message was clear: If you like Sanders' politics and want his platform to become a reality, I'm the one to make it happen -- and unify the party in the process.Sanders still has a Cuba problemOther candidates might have failed to nail him down on it. But Sanders showed he hadn't come up with a stronger explanation for his praise of Fidel Castro's Cuban regime's literacy efforts -- something that could become a long-term political headache for the Vermont senator's campaign.   On Tuesday night, Sanders pointed out that former President Barack Obama had made comments similar to his about Cuba. \"Occasionally, it might be a good idea to be honest about American foreign policy, and that includes the fact that America has overthrown governments all over the world -- in Chile, in Guatemala, in Iran, and when dictatorships, whether it is the Chinese or the Cubans, do something good, you acknowledge that, but you don't have to trade love letters with them,\" Sanders said.That moved him past the moment Tuesday night. But it likely won't calm the nerves of Democrats -- especially in Florida -- who are worried about how the GOP will weaponize Sanders' words. Bloomberg shows preparation mattersDemocratic presidential candidate former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg speaks during the Democratic presidential primary debate at the Charleston Gaillard Center on February 25, 2020 in Charleston, South Carolina.Bloomberg's performance last week in Las Vegas was disastrous -- so the mayor canceled all but one event in between the two debates to prepare for his second appearance on stage.And, while his performance Tuesday was far from perfect, the extra preparation showed. Bloomberg faced harsh attacks from Warren over lewd comments he made to former employees and comments he made about redlining, racist policies that blocked African Americans and Latinos from buying homes for decades.But Bloomberg approached the debate differently and was far more aggressive in pushing back and attempting to move on. He said Warren was \"misinformed\" on redlining and presented a litany of housing policies he pushed as mayor. And when Warren attacked him for reportedly telling a female employee who was pregnant to \"kill it,\" Bloomberg simply said, \"I never said that.\"Bloomberg got to tout his own policies, and said his approach to trans-fats and sugary beverages in New York wouldn't translate nationally. He said Chinese president Xi Jinping isn't a dictator -- a remark that drew an immediate rebuke from Sanders.  But Bloomberg was on the verge of making a major gaffe, nearly saying he \"bought\" House races in 2018 before catching himself and instead saying, \"I got them.\"Buttigieg makes everything about SandersDemocratic presidential candidate former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg speaks as former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg (L) \n and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) (R) looks on during the Democratic presidential primary debate at the Charleston Gaillard Center on February 25, 2020 in Charleston, South Carolina. Buttigieg made clear on Tuesday that the only way he wins the Democratic nomination is by taking Sanders down.Nearly every moment Buttigieg was able to comment on -- from foreign policy, to health care to his campaign fundraising -- was turned into an attack on the frontrunner. And Buttigieg was far more aggressive than any past debate, regularly jumping in and talking over Sanders when he could.\"Look, if you think the last four years has been chaotic, divisive, toxic, exhausting,\" Buttigieg said, \"imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders vs. Donald Trump.\"Buttigieg also took Sanders on for criticizing his fundraising, questioned the senator's ability to \"deliver a revolution\" and echoed the fears some Democrats have about the independent by stoking speculation about what his nomination would mean to down ballot races for the House and Senate.\"They are running away from your platform as fast as they possibly can,\" Buttigieg said of House members who won for the first time in 2018.While Buttigieg delivered a steady performance, his strategy also reflects the fact that, without a significant change in the race, the former mayor's window to the nomination could be closing. Klobuchar changes her tackDemocratic presidential candidate Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) speaks as former Vice President Joe Biden (L) and Tom Steyer (R) look on during the Democratic presidential primary debate at the Charleston Gaillard Center on February 25, 2020 in Charleston, South Carolina. The Klobuchar that delivered a combative, fiery performance at the debate last week in Las Vegas was almost unrecognizable compared to the candidate who criticized the field for discord on Tuesday night.Klobuchar barely leveled any attacks on Tuesday night; instead, she consistently answered some of the more substantive questions and attempting to sound like the voice of reason on an otherwise chaotic stage.It's a departure for the senator, who was unafraid to mix is up last week, especially with Buttigieg, a candidate she has long had a deep-seated animosity towards.Klobuchar still got a few shots in, like when she hit Sanders over Medicare for All and subtly knocked Buttigieg for mentioning his campaign website on stage. But her debate was more defined by answers on both domestic and foreign policy and the moments where she took issue with the tone and tenor of the contest.\"If we spend the next four months tearing our party apart,\" Klobuchar said, \"we're going to watch Donald Trump spend the next four years tearing our country apart.\"Biden his timeDemocratic presidential candidates (L-R) former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Tom Steyer participate in the Democratic presidential primary debate at the Charleston Gaillard Center on February 25, 2020 in Charleston, South Carolina. Biden was in the middle of an answer when he abruptly stopped -- and then wondered why he had. \"Why am I stopping? No one else stops,\" he said, chalking it up to his \"Catholic school training.\" CBS moderator Gayle King called him a \"gentleman\" for following the rules. \"Gentlemen don't get very well treated up here,\" he groused.Biden was right: Tuesday night's moderation contributed to the most chaotic atmosphere of any of the 10 Democratic debates to date. CBS anchors at times lost control and let the candidates brawl -- and then selectively attempted to regain it by repeatedly interrupting candidates mid-answer. The questions often seemed to ignore -- or be months behind -- the real points of tension in the Democratic presidential race. And the candidates often ignored the questions, as Biden did when he was asked to name the biggest misconception about him and offer his personal motto, and he answered in part by promising to appoint a black woman to the Supreme Court.",

        "content": "(CNN)The 10th Democratic debate -- this one in Charleston, South Carolina -- is in the books.  It was an incredibly contentious affair, with candidates shouting at (and over) one another as they scrambled to draw contrasts with each other in advance of the critical South Carolina primary on Saturday.\n\n\n\n\n\n THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\n\n\nBelow, the best and worst from the night that was. WINNERS Pete Buttigieg: The former South Bend, Indiana, mayor was at his absolute best in this debate. He found several occasions to make direct contrasts with Bernie Sanders -- most notably on the dangers for Democrats of nominating a democratic socialist and the differences in their health care plans -- which is a win in and of itself. Buttigieg also flashed a sense of humor when plugging his website to encourage donations, which was a welcome moment of levity in a debate defined by people shouting at one another at very close range. If voters were looking for a Sanders alternative who looked like he could be commander in chief in this debate, Buttigieg made a very good case for himself.Read More Joe Biden: Biden turned his outrage meter WAY up in this debate. He hammered Tom Steyer on the billionaire's support for private prisons, a move aimed at trying to peel away black voters from Steyer in advance of the South Carolina primary. He cast Sanders as a dangerous risk for the Democratic Party to take, with potentially disastrous down-ballot consequences. If Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-South Carolina) was looking for energy out of Biden before making a formal endorsement decision -- Clyburn will announce his choice Wednesday morning -- he got it from the former vice president. Biden is still not a terribly good debater, however. He repeatedly stumbled as he tried to make his points. He kept claiming he wrote every bill -- or close to it -- anyone on the stage cited. He repeatedly complained about the rules of the debate -- not a good look. But on the whole. there was more good than bad here for Biden.  Amy Klobuchar: As she has done in nearly every debate, the Minnesota senator did more with fewer opportunities than almost any other candidate on stage. She repeatedly sought to be a voice of reason (and calm) as everyone around her just kept shouting. She also delivered a series of solid policy proposals -- outlining her views on domestic and foreign policy to many voters who may have just been getting to know her and what she believes. Klobuchar wasn't as sharp -- or as much of a standout -- as she was in the debate just before the New Hampshire primary. But in a debate defined by the bad, she was a bright spot. Bernie Sanders: The Vermont senator got hit with a few hard punches to which he had no response. His voting record on guns. How he would pay for his policy proposals. And booing from the crowd -- more on this below -- clearly threw him off his game. But no one knocked Sanders out. And given his strengths in the race right now, that amounts to a win for him. If nothing major changes in the race between now and Super Tuesday, Sanders will emerge on March 4 with a very clear delegate lead. And nothing fundamental changed tonight. Donald Trump: A bitter, angry shout-fest in which virtually every potential nominee's dirty laundry was aired? The President couldn't have drawn up a better debate for his chances of winning a second term.LOSERS Michael Bloomberg: The billionaire businessman was better in this debate than in the last one in Las Vegas. But he wasn't good. Bloomberg committed a near-Freudian slip early in the debate when he started to say he \"bought\" a Democratic House majority before re-calibrating to say he helped Democrats reclaim the majority. Bloomberg awkwardly referred to his rivals as fellow \"contestants.\" He tried to make jokes -- most notably about his poor performance in the last debate. Notice how I said he \"tried.\" And Bloomberg still doesn't have a good answer about his alleged off-color jokes and dismissive past comments about women. How is that possible? Elizabeth Warren: She was totally fine. But fine is probably not enough given that Warren has yet to finish in the Top 2 in any state and looks very unlikely to do so in South Carolina on Saturday. The Massachusetts senator seemed most impassioned -- and effective -- while attacking Bloomberg for his past comments about women and his wealth. Warren faded from view too often, however, in other parts of the debate. She needed another star turn like she had in Las Vegas six days ago. She didn't get one. Moderators: The five-person CBS team swung between refusing to get involved as the candidates talked over one another for 15-20 seconds at a time and stepping in at unnecessary moments to break up actual substantive disagreements between the candidates. The questions were also not great -- focused too much on narrow policy matters (charter schools) and not enough on BIG issues of the day like, say, the coronavirus. Look, I'm under no illusion that moderating a debate like this one is easy. It's not. But the CBS moderators often didn't seem up to the task.* Live audience: The clapping and booing of candidates was totally out of control. And unfortunately it affected the candidates (see my Sanders write-up above) and will likely have some reverberations on how people watching on TV thought the field performed. I am against live-audience debates in general, since the debates are quite clearly (and should be) produced with the live TV (and streaming) audience in mind. But if you are going to let the audience be there, then enforce a policy of polite clapping and no booing. Please.",

        "content": "(CNN)The five children of Alton Sterling have settled with the city of Baton Rouge for $4.5 million, according to a statement from their attorneys.Sterling was shot and killed by one of two police officers who confronted him outside a convenience store in July 2016. Cell phone video showed Sterling pinned to the ground by the officers before he was shot; police said Sterling was reaching for a gun.The fatal encounter between the two White police officers and Sterling, a Black man, helped spur Black Lives Matter protests across the nation.The killing gripped the nation in part because two videos taken by bystanders, each less than a minute long, were released publicly shortly after the shooting and captured the final part of Sterling's struggle with the two officers.Read MoreNo charges were brought against the officers involved.A judge has ordered the city of Baton Rouge to turn over a psychological evaluation for the officer who shot and killed Alton Sterling\"On behalf of the family of Alton Sterling, we are pleased to announce that we have reached a $4.5 million settlement with the city of Baton Rouge and dismissed our lawsuit against the city and others,\" the attorneys say in a statement.The statement also says the settlement will allow the city to heal and help the children to be provided for financially.  The attorneys also said they were grateful for what they called \"significant policy changes\" undertaken by the city and the Police Department.CNN has reached out to the Baton Rouge police and the city for comment on the settlement. Mayor Pro Tem LaMont Cole told CNN affiliate WBRZ, \"Any time we can move beyond an issue that was so polarizing here in our community I think it's a good thing.\"Blane Salamoni, the officer who fatally shot Sterling, was fired in March 2018 for violations of the department's use of force policy, according to Chief Murphy Paul. Officer Howie Lake was suspended for three days.Authorities have said Salamoni and Lake went to the store after police received a 911 call from a man who said someone had pulled a gun on him.In May 2017, federal prosecutors found there wasn't enough evidence to warrant civil rights charges against Salamoni and Lake.The federal prosecutors cited use-of-force experts who determined the officers' actions were reasonable under the circumstances -- including that the two employed several less-than-lethal techniques before using force, and that Sterling struggled with the officers and failed to follow orders.The Justice Department also said evidence couldn't prove or disprove Salamoni's assertion that Sterling was reaching for a gun.In March 2018, Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry declined to file charges saying in a written report on the investigation: \"We have concluded that the officers in question acted as reasonable officers under existing law and were justified in their use of force.\"Attorney for the Sterling family said in 2018 that Salamoni rushed at Sterling, who didn't threaten or put a hand on officers.He repeatedly asked Salamoni and Lake what he had done, they said.\"Never once pushed an officer, touched an officer, kicked an officer, did anything,\" attorney Chris Stewart said. \"But yet he ended up dead.\"CNN's Chenelle Terry contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Rayshard Brooks was remembered at his funeral Tuesday as a smiling, oft-dancing, hard-working father brought down by a racist legal system of imprisonment, probation and police violence.A private funeral service was held in Atlanta at historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. served as a co-pastor from 1960 until his assassination in 1968.Ambrea Mikolajczyk, who runs a construction company in Toledo, Ohio, where Brooks worked last year, said he biked to work every day as he tried to overcome the restrictions placed on him while on probation.\"Ray had overcome his circumstances. He was working hard to become the best provider, caretaker, community builder, father, husband, son, brother and relationship agent he could possibly be,\" she said. \"The justice system and systemic racism that exists made it fairly impossible for him to try to live a prosperous life well after he had paid his debt.\"In one instance, a coworker's car broke down and Brooks got off his bike and walked alongside the coworker for two hours.Read More\"That's the type of man Ray was. He looked out for everyone,\" she said.The funeral comes more than a week after the 27-year-old father was shot and killed by an Atlanta police officer after he fought with police and tried to flee during an attempted drunken driving arrest. The shooting, amid nationwide protests against systemic racism and police brutality, has led to the resignation of the police chief and criminal charges against the officer who killed him and another officer on scene.King's daughter, the Rev. Bernice A. King, said that one of the things that touched her during the service was the power of love, and how we need love in this time.\"We are wrestling with a past of violence, we were founded in violence,\" she told CNN after the funeral. \"We are in a moment, a reckoning on whether we are going to disassociate ourselves from that kind of past and create what my father called the beloved community, where you recognize the humanity of people and you respect the dignity and worth of an individual and you ensure that there is equity and justice for all people.\"Pallbearers bring Rayshard Brooks to the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta for his funeral on Monday.The Rev. Raphael G. Warnock, the senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church and a Democratic candidate for US Senate, noted Brooks was killed while running away and George Floyd was killed by police while complying.\"If your skin is the weapon and your complexion is the crime, what do you do to stay alive? Comply like George Floyd? Or run like Rayshard Brooks? I'm not asking for a friend, I'm asking for myself and my nieces and my nephews and my children,\" he said.\"This country has become too accustomed and comfortable with black people dying. That's what we mean when we say Black Lives Matter. It is a way of saying see our humanity.\"Tomika Miller, wife of Rayshard Brooks, holds their 2-year-old daughter Memory while pausing with her children at his funeral Monday at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta.King told funeral-goers she knew the pain of growing up without a father.\"Rayshard Brooks' life matters and he should have been able to live, to enjoy his family and watch his kids grow into adulthood,\" she said. \"And the officers should have gone home that night without blood on their hands.\"King said that it was especially troubling that Brooks was killed in a city that is home to \"civil and human rights.\"\"This happened in the city that has been known as the black mecca. This happened in the city whose grounds are known for America and the world warrior of peace, my daddy, Martin Luther King, Jr., who taught us that true peace is not merely the absence of tension but it is the presence of justice. Therefore, there can be no peace in Atlanta nor anywhere in our nation where there is no justice.\"King then raised her fist in the air while saying, \"No justice, no peace.\"  Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and Stacey Abrams, the former top Democrat in the Georgia House, were also in attendance, and gospel singers Smokie Norful, Tamela Mann and Kurt Carr performed at the service.Media mogul Tyler Perry has offered to pay for the funeral arrangements, according to Brooks' family attorney Chris Stewart and a news release.Struggle to overcome imprisonment and probationBrooks leaves behind his widow, Tomika Miller, three young daughters and a 13-year-old stepson. In an interview in February with Reconnect, a company that focuses on fighting incarceration, Brooks spoke openly about his time spent in prison and his struggle to care for his family while on probation.\"I just feel like some of the system could, you know, look at us as individuals,\" he said. \"We do have lives, you know, was just a mistake we made, you know, and, you know, not, not just do us, as if we are animals. You know, lock us away.\"Rayshard Brooks opened up about the struggles of life after incarceration in an interview before his deathBrooks told the interviewer he was arrested for false imprisonment and financial credit card fraud. He said his public defender told him he could get 10 years, so he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a year in prison.\"I'm like, 'oh my God, I have kids out here' ... so I'm trying to do the best option I can to be back to society,\" he said.Nationwide, 4.5 million people are on probation or parole, and African-Americans make up 30 percent of those on community supervision.As part of a plea deal, Brooks pleaded guilty in 2014 to charges of false imprisonment, simple battery/family, simple battery and felony cruelty/cruelty to children, and he was sentenced to one year in prison and six years on probation, according to court records. Two years later, he was sent back to prison for 12 months for violating his probation.The Rev. Warnock said that the video of Brooks' comments was heartbreaking.\"He talks about how hard it is to come back, to recover when you return. He was trying. He had been digging his way back. And he knew that night that he could very well lose his liberty,\" Warnock said. \"Afraid of losing his liberty, he lost his life, running from a system that too often makes slaves out of people.\"This is much bigger than the police. This is about a whole system that cries out for renewal and reform.\"Other speakers spoke about his personality and love of music and dancing. Rochelle Gooden, his mother-in-law, said Brooks had a wide smile and fondly recalled his love for old-school music like Al Green.His cousin, Jymaco Brooks, said Rayshard Brooks was the type of person who would always make you laugh.\"All he wanted to do was smile, crack jokes, dance a little bit and live,\" he said.The fatal shootingJUST WATCHEDBodycam video shows moments leading up to fatal shootingReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBodycam video shows moments leading up to fatal shooting 02:48Brooks died after he was shot in the back on June 12 by Atlanta police officer Garrett Rolfe.The incident began when officer Devin Brosnan responded to a Wendy's restaurant to find Brooks asleep in his car in the drive-through lane.Atlanta is once again at the center of the nation's struggle with race and civil rightsAfter a calm, lengthy interaction, Brooks failed a sobriety test, and when police moved to handcuff him, he resisted and tried to fight off the officers. During the fight, Brooks took one of the officers' Tasers, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.Video of the incident shows him running away, and he appears to turn and point the Taser in the direction of one of the officers. The officer, Rolfe, then fired his handgun three times, striking Brooks twice in the back and also hitting a nearby occupied vehicle.Rolfe was fired and Brosnan was placed on administrative dutyFulton County District Attorney Paul Howard charged Rolfe with felony murder and 10 other accounts and charged Brosnan with aggravated assault for allegedly standing on Brooks' shoulders as he lay dying.Rolfe's attorneys said that he fired the fatal shots \"fearing for his safety and the safety of the civilians around him.\" Brosnan said that he suffered a concussion during the fight and that he stepped on Brooks for a short period of time in the immediate, disorienting aftermath of the shooting.CNN's Lindsay Benson, Chuck Johnston, Randi Kaye, Pamela Kirkland, Jamiel Lynch, Laura Robinson, Devon Sayers and Nick Valencia contributed to this report.",

Gregory McMichael, who was in the bed of the pickup during the shooting, told police that Bryan had tried to help them stop Arbery earlier, according to an incident report.A person can be charged with felony murder in Georgia if he or she is alleged to have contributed to another's death, even unintentionally, while committing another felony. Bryan also faces a charge of criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment. William \"Roddie\" Bryan Jr. has been arrested on charges including felony murder, authorities said.Kevin Gough, an attorney for Bryan who could not be reached Thursday, has said his client committed no crime, was no vigilante and would be the state's \"star witness.\"He told CNN last week that Bryan was working in his yard when he saw a person he did not know being chased by a vehicle he recognized from the neighborhood.Read MoreBryan spoke to CNN's Chris Cuomo on May 11 and said he prays for the Arbery family every night.He said of the video, \"I hope that it, in the end, brings justice to the family and peace to the family.\"The attorneys representing members of the Arbery family said they were relieved.State police search home of suspects in Ahmaud Arbery's killing\"We called for his arrest from the very beginning of this process,\" the family's attorneys S. Lee Merritt, Benjamin Crump, and L. Chris Stewart, said. \"His involvement in the murder of Mr. Arbery was obvious to us, to many around the country and after their thorough investigation, it was clear to the GBI as well.\"They thanked the GBI for its diligence.\"I can say Wanda Cooper and Marcus Arbery were very, very relieved to see this arrest finally take place. Not only have we been waiting since the McMichaels were arrested, they have been waiting for three months for all three of these men to be brought into custody,\" Merritt told CNN's Don Lemon Thursday night. Bryan, who recorded the shooting, and his attorney have maintained that he is innocent of any wrongdoing. On Monday evening, Gough, Bryan's attorney, said his client had no prior contact or plan with the McMichaels prior to the shooting.\"The initial police report described his role in it,\" Merritt said. \"The idea that he was just a witness, recording the video -- that's a recent invention. His role in this ambush was well documented in the original police report and is demonstrated by video.\"\"It's based on that video and probable cause why he is in custody,\" Crump told Lemon.Bryan to be booked into same jail as McMichaelsPolice attempted to use Taser on Ahmaud Arbery during a 2017 incident The GBI, which is conducting the investigation into Arbery's death, said Bryan, 50, was arrested Thursday and will face charges of felony murder and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment. Bryan will be booked into the Glynn County Jail, where the McMichaels are being held on charges of murder and aggravated assault.  The father and son's legal teams have said the full details of the case haven't made it into the public arena, and they've promised the truth will exonerate their clients.  CNN attempted to reach Gough on Thursday evening.Video was recorded on Bryan's cellphoneThe video Bryan recorded on his cellphone shows Arbery trying to run around the McMichaels' truck before turning sharply toward Travis McMichael and tussling over his shotgun. Arbery was shot three times and collapsed in the street. Attorney says Ahmaud Arbery's family wants man who filmed fatal shooting arrested as his attorney says lie detector test proves he didn't participateThe 36-second video was not released until more than 10 weeks after the killing and spurred calls for the McMichaels' arrests. It does not show what led up to the final moments of Arbery's life.Gregory McMichael -- a former prosecutorial investigator, ex-Glynn County police officer and Travis' father -- told police that he and his son chased Arbery after seeing him at a neighbor's under-construction home. They suspected him in a rash of break-ins, according to an incident report. McMichael told police his son had tried to cut off Arbery with his truck but Arbery turned around.\"McMichael stated the unidentified male turned around and began running back the direction from which he came and 'Roddy' attempted to block him in which was unsuccessful,\" the police report says. Arbery's family has said he was jogging through the neighborhood.Surveillance videos show multiple people had trespassed at the home Ahmaud Arbery visited. He was the only one killedGough said Monday that Bryan had taken a polygraph test that confirmed he was not involved in the shooting.  Bryan was unarmed at the time of shooting and that Bryan did not have any conversation with Gregory or Travis McMichael before the shooting, Gough said, citing test results. Bryan took the test voluntarily, Gough told reporters.CNN's Martin Savidge, Hollie Silverman, Jamiel Lynch and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Cell phone videos from protests around the country in recent weeks have recorded scenes that seem like they're straight out of a warzone: Police officers decked out in body armor and gas masks, facing down protesters across tear gas-filled streets.\u202f One reason why: Many police departments are equipped with gear that comes directly from the US military. The Defense Department has sent at least $760 million worth of surplus military equipment to law enforcement agencies around the country since August 2017, when President Trump lifted restrictions imposed on those transfers by his predecessor Barack Obama, a CNN analysis of federal data found.\u202f \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\n\n\n\nThat total, delivered through what's known as the 1033 Program, included more than $5.3 million worth of potentially protest-related military equipment -- gear like riot shields, gas masks and tasers, as well as other equipment that law enforcement agencies told the DOD they were requesting to use during riots, protests, or other crowd control situations. (Some of the equipment may have been decommissioned or returned to the feds since the agencies received it.) Now, as debates over how to reform or defund police departments are growing around the country, the pipeline from the military to cops on the streets is facing a wave of renewed criticism, with members of Congress from both parties pushing to change it or end the program altogether.\u202f Read MoreWhile Trump provoked a bipartisan backlash with his threat to deploy US troops to major cities, some of the police departments responding to protests and riots have already been equipped with the same gear soldiers might use.\u202f A Miami Police officer watches protestors from a armored vehicle during a rally in response to the recent death of George Floyd in Miami, Florida on May 31.Terron Sims II, an Army veteran in Arlington, Virginia who's attended several recent protests, said some of the videos he's seen of officers rolling through their cities in mine-resistant vehicles remind him of the equipment he used while serving in Iraq.\u202f \"It'd be one thing if you're fighting al Qaeda in the streets, but we're not,\" said Sims. \"They're facing a peaceful crowd of folks exercising their constitutional rights. It's ridiculous.\"\u202f Obama moved to restrict the program in 2015 after the first major Black Lives Matter demonstrations in Ferguson, Missouri, and elsewhere, putting in place new limits on some equipment and banning other gear such as tracked armored vehicles, weaponized aircraft, and grenade launchers.\u202fBut Trump undid those restrictions in August 2017.  Police leaders have defended the program, arguing that military-style equipment -- which departments receive for free -- can save the lives of officers facing dangers like mass shootings, or help protect them if protests turn violent.  The DOD did not respond to a request for comment about the program.  There's a growing call to defund the police. Here's what it meansDavid Chasteen, an Army veteran who served in Iraq and later worked as a civilian executive in the San Francisco Police Department, said he was dismayed by police officers \"play-acting what they think it's like to be in the military.\" \"This stuff is designed for us to go and kill people in order to accomplish our objectives,\" Chasteen said. \"The idea that those tools should then be put to use against people in the U.S. is wildly offensive and un-American. That's not how we do things here.\" Ironically, Chasteen said, over years of counterinsurgency missions in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, the US military has moved away from using massive shows of force when soldiers try to reach out to civilians.  \"We stopped driving tanks into neighborhoods, we started taking off the body armor, we said 'don't point your weapons at people,'\" Chasteen said. \"You have to demonstrate to people you are trustworthy and you're going to be there for them, not that you consider them to be the enemy.\" \"If we can do that in Iraq and Afghanistan, then sure as s* cops can do that in Minnesota,\" he said.Why police request military suppliesSome of the equipment that's been sent around the country through the program was specifically requested by police to deal with protests.  Over the two and a half decades the program has been in place, more than 250 agencies have received 12-gauge riot guns -- used to fire tear gas canisters or other projectiles -- through the program, including the Baltimore Sheriff's Office, Virginia Beach Sheriff's Office, and Hartford Police Department. Columbia Police and the Richland County Sheriff's Department in South Carolina marched through the streets after enacting a curfew amid protests.The Houston Police Department received 38 riot training suits worth a total of more than $64,000 and 91 riot control shields worth $12,000. Riot shields and face shields also went to agencies big and small, including the Milwaukee Police Department and university police departments at Clemson University and Alabama State University. Several law enforcement agencies in California, Oregon and Colorado have received long-range acoustic devices, or LRAD's, which blast a painful wall of sound at protesters and have been used by some police departments against recent protests. \"This unit would be used by our tactical team in the event that large crowds need to be addressed,\" the sheriff's office in rural Douglas County, Oregon wrote in its application to the Defense Department for a $34,500 LRAD. \"We currently have no capability of this type.\" The sheriff's office said it has not yet used the device, which it received in November. Police reform efforts face highest hurdle: Bitter Washington inertia\u202fAmong the agencies that cracked down on protests in Minneapolis, the Minnesota state Department of Public Safety received dozens of rifles from the program, as well as a dozen night vision viewers and \"sniperscopes\" worth thousands of dollars each. In 2019, state regulators suspended the sheriff's office in Hennepin County, which includes Minneapolis, from receiving any equipment through the program for 30 days due to \"failure to report missing controlled property,\" according to documents obtained by CNN through a public records request. The county had lost track of two of about 100 of the gun sights it had received from the feds. Another small police department in the state was also given a temporary suspension after it lost several pieces of equipment, including a .45 caliber handgun, which was in possession of a former officer who had been dismissed from the force. How police militarization can impact communitiesOne of the most visible pieces of military equipment on show during some recent protests have been huge mine-resistant vehicles, known as MRAP's. In Columbia, South Carolina, a local TV station filmed the local police department's MRAP rolling slowly down a street a block away from the State Capitol, flanked by dozens of officers in riot gear and shields.  Found the source of the flash bangs. Police line moving down Gervais now from Park. pic.twitter.com/R44l7PAh3j\u2014 WIS News 10 (@wis10) May 31, 2020\n\nThe Columbia police department received the $658,000 vehicle through the program in 2013, and has also been sent dozens of rifles, several trucks an unmanned ground vehicles, and other gear over the years.  Jennifer Timmons, a spokesperson for the department, said the MRAP was used \"to protect citizens and officers during hostile protests\" because rocks and bottles were being thrown at police, although she said no injuries were reported at the protests. The vehicle is typically used during incidents with armed, barricaded suspects, and other former military vehicles have helped the department save lives during devastating flooding, she said.  Other police departments that receive the military equipment make similar arguments, calling the program an important resource to keep officers safe. And they point out that without the program, taxpayer dollars would be going to purchase similar gear.  GOP and Democrats clash over police reform in Congress as pressure for action mountsBut experts say that images of police deploying in ballistic armor or bringing out their tank-like vehicles could deal lasting damage to officers' relationships with their communities.\u202f \u202f\"When police use this militarized equipment, many black and brown people see them acting as occupying forces,\" said Jennifer Cobbina, a professor at Michigan State University who wrote a\u202fbook\u202fabout Black Lives Matter protests in Ferguson and Baltimore. \"They shouldn't be seen as warriors, they should be working with the community to promote public safety.\"\u202f From swords to duffel bags to MRAPsThe military supply program was first approved in its modern form in 1996, designed to support local cops at the height of the war on drugs with gear the troops no longer needed.  Since then, there's been more than $5 billion in free equipment doled out to police departments through the program.\u202fIf the equipment isn't transferred to other agencies, the Defense Department will donate it, sell it, or destroy it.  Police officers arrest a demonstrator in Ferguson, Missouri, during protests following the death of Michael Brown in August 2014. A little more than a third of the equipment shipped since August 2017, based on its total cost, is tactical equipment, such as mine-resistant vehicles or night-vision goggles, while the rest is more everyday items like first aid kits, computers or duffel bags, according to CNN's analysis.  And some of the items are simply bizarre, like the \"sword and scabbard\" sent to two small police departments in suburbs near New York City and Atlanta -- or the Los Angeles School Police Department's\u202frequest\u202ffor three grenade launchers (which it later returned) and 61 rifles (which it kept).\u202f Most of the gear went to local police and sheriff's departments in small towns and rural counties around the country. America has to reckon with its original sinsThe program got a wave of attention after the 2014 protests over the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, where gas mask and body armor-clad officers aggressively cracked down on mostly black protesters. Cell phone videos of armored police vehicles rolling through suburban streets sparked outrage over the militarization.\u202f\u202f As controversy over the program grew, Obama issued an executive order in May 2015 banning a long list of equipment from being sent to police departments, including armored vehicles, grenade launchers, high-caliber weapons and camouflage uniforms. \"Militarized gear can sometimes give people a feeling like there's an occupying force, as opposed to a force that's part of the community that's protecting them and serving them,\" Obama said as he signed the order. \"It can alienate and intimidate local residents and send the wrong message.\" Police attempt to control demonstrators protesting the killing of teenager Michael Brown on August 18, 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri. But the change lasted barely two years. Seven months after Trump took office in 2017, he signed his own executive order\u202frolling back\u202fthe Obama-era restrictions.\u202f \"We will not put superficial concerns above public safety,\" then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions told a police union conference at the time. The order will \"ensure that you can get the lifesaving gear that you need to do your job and send a strong message that we will not allow criminal activity, violence and lawlessness to become the new normal,\" he said. \u202fUnder the Trump administration, the Defense Department has sent out some of the same gear that Obama had banned, such as bayonets designed to be attached to rifles. Twenty-seven law enforcement agencies received bayonet knives or bayonets and scabbards through the program since August 2017, the data shows. \u202fLocal and national criticism grows Washington State Police uses tear gas to disperse a crowd during a demonstration protesting the death of George Floyd on May 30.Now, in the wake of the Floyd protests, the program's future is again in jeopardy. Democrats in the House and Senate have introduced legislation to reform the program or cancel it altogether, and several Republicans have signed on.\u202f \"Weapons of war don't belong in our local police departments and should never be used against the American people,\" Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, said in a statement. A new bill he introduced this month would ban the transfer of offensive military equipment, but still allow police to receive defensive equipment.\u202f New York will require its state troopers to wear body cameras on patrolThere's also growing opposition to militarized equipment from local communities. In Culver City, California, local activists and elected officials organized to push the city's police department to cancel its plan to purchase a military-style BearCat armored personnel carrier in recent weeks. The department cut the vehicle as part of broader coronavirus-related budget cuts.\"The vehicles themselves can more or less inflame whatever situation is going on,\" said Daniel Lee, a city council member and Air Force veteran who successfully advocated for the item to be cut from the Los Angeles suburb's budget. \"It really puts people on a wartime footing, and it sends the wrong message.\" Many police leaders defend the program. Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo, the president of the national Major Cities Chiefs Association, said that it made sense for police in \"one of the most violent nations in the civilized free world\" to use military-style equipment.\u202f Officers equipped with high-powered rifles were able to take down a mass shooter in Dayton, Ohio, last year, saving many lives, and a mine-resistant vehicle from the 1033 program allowed at least one rural Texas police department to help residents escape flooding, Acevedo argued.\u202f Supplies from the program have also been used to help local governments fight the coronavirus pandemic, from a former military Humvee being used as an ambulance to transport patients in rural Indiana to tents used for decontamination in New Jersey, according to the DOD. \"It's not about the equipment, it's about the proper policy for its use,\" Acevedo said. \"Everybody needs to take a deep breath and stop using their emotion and stop painting these issues with broad brushes.\" How we reported this storyFor this story, CNN examined 1033 Program data from the Defense Department's Defense Logistics Agency.For several of the findings in this story, CNN relied on the DLA's transferred property data. That data, which is published quarterly and only includes property currently held by participating agencies, includes information on more than 140,000 equipment transfers to local police agencies and includes items' names, classification codes (known as National Stock Numbers, or \"NSN\"s), each shipment's date, and the quantity and acquisition value of each item shipped.To investigate the transfer of tactical equipment, reporters used the NSNs to focus on items categorized as weaponry; ammunition and explosives; missiles; and aircraft, seacraft and related accessories. Reporters also read through item descriptions for thousands of additional items to identify at least 600 more tactical or combat-related items, including training equipment.For CNN's reporting on equipment received by individual agencies, reporters also analyzed the DLA's shipments and cancellations data, which goes back to July 2017 and includes statements submitted by agencies to justify their requests for equipment. Reporters also analyzed this data for their findings on protest-related equipment, which CNN identified by searching for entries where the item name or request justification included the terms \"riot,\" \"protest,\" \"crowd control,\" \"civil disturbance,\" \"firing device,\" \"pepper spray,\" \"faceshield,\" \"ballistic shields,\" \"personal protective shields,\" \"ballistic shield,\" \"gas mask\" and \"long range acoustic.\"CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to clarify that the armored vehicle purchase in Culver City was eliminated due to coronavirus-related budget cuts.Janie Boschma and Sonam Vashi contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Help CNN investigate Hurricane Maria deaths.A judge ordered the Puerto Rican government to release the names of everyone who has died since the storm. Which deaths were related to the hurricane? Help us find out.Patillas, Puerto Rico (CNN)Ramon Cruz Laboy, a 75-year-old who kept to himself and never wanted to burden his relatives, died January 24 from medical complications that resulted from a femur fracture he suffered during a gust of wind from Hurricane Maria.Reinaldo Ruiz Cintron, 59, who loved the ocean so much friends nicknamed him \"Rey Bruquena,\" or \"Rey Crab,\" died two months after a tree branch fell on him in October while he was cleaning up debris from that hurricane, which ravaged Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017. Both men are labeled in a government database, obtained by CNN and the Center for Investigative Journalism (CPI), as \"victim of cataclysmic storm.\" Yet neither man's name appears on Puerto Rico's list of 64 hurricane victims, which has been criticized by journalists and academics as grossly inaccurate. \"How could it be possible that (documents say) it was related to the hurricane and still the government did not count him in the 64?\" said Lisa De Jes\u00fas, a friend of Ruiz who said she took him into her home because his house was so damaged in the storm. \"It's obvious there were more than 64 deaths. If he was not counted, how many more were not counted?\"Read MoreCruz's sister-in-law, Wanda Garcia, 71, didn't know he was not on Puerto Rico's list of hurricane deaths until a reporter told her. \"He's not there?\" she said. \"He should be there. He was not supposed to die -- not from these conditions. ... I'm shocked he is not on the list.\" Lisa De Jes\u00fas holds a picture of her deceased friend, \"Rey Bruquena,\" or \"Rey Crab,\" who earned that nickname because of his love for the ocean.CNN reviewed a database of about 23,000 death certificates after a Puerto Rican judge ordered that information and other records be turned over to CNN and CPI, which filed lawsuits in February asking that the documents be made public. Both organizations are continuing to review the records. CNN posted a searchable database of everyone who died in the months after Hurricane Maria -- regardless of cause -- asking its audience to help investigate. Shortly after receiving the database, CNN reporters found 38 instances in which death records listed a \"cataclysmic storm\" as a contributor to the deaths. Most of the victims whose deaths are labeled that way appear on Puerto Rico's list of 64 hurricane victims. At least six of the names, however, do not appear on the government's tally of storm deaths. CNN investigated three of those six deaths in detail. Among those not appearing on the victims list were Cruz and Ruiz. A third person, Miguel Angel Maldonado Santana, died in a car accident his family believes was hurricane-related. All three deaths, according to records, were autopsied and reviewed by the Bureau of Forensic Sciences in San Juan, the only institution authorized to classify hurricane deaths. 'Victim of cataclysmic storm'Lisa De Jes\u00fas and Luis M. Cruz, Ramon Cruz's brother, told CNN they went to that forensics office to identify the bodies. Interviewers there asked them about the circumstances of the deaths, they said. Those circumstances appear to meet criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for disaster-related deaths. Guidelines published by the CDC in October 2017 say injuries suffered during cleanup after a disaster, \"blunt-force trauma\" related to a disaster and \"acute exacerbation of chronic condition(s)\" following a disaster, among other direct and indirect causes of death, should be classified as disaster-related.Officials in Puerto Rico have said they are following CDC guidelines.  Puerto Rican officials did not respond to requests for comment on the particular circumstances of the deaths labeled as \"victim of cataclysmic storm,\" part of an internationally recognized way to classify deaths and medical issues. A spokeswoman for the Puerto Rico Department of Public Safety, which oversees the count, issued a general statement to CNN on Friday. \"The government of Puerto Rico has announced that George Washington University is conducting a review and research of the deaths associated with Hurricane Maria,\" she said. \"Once the process has concluded, the results and any additional details, to those stipulated and related to the deaths associated with Hurricane Maria, will be communicated.\"The Hurricane Maria death toll in Puerto Rico has been the subject of controversy since US President Donald Trump visited the island October 3, proclaiming that the storm's death toll -- then 16 -- was laudably low given the severity of the hurricane. Later that day, after Trump left the island, the official tally of hurricane deaths rose to 34. It stands at 64. Evidence suggests the toll may be substantially higher. JUST WATCHEDMaria's uncounted deadReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMaria's uncounted dead 04:33In May, researchers from Harvard University and elsewhere published a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine estimating between 793 and 8,498 people died in the storm and its chaotic aftermath, which included months without power and basic services for many. That analysis was based on interviews with more than 3,000 households in Puerto Rico.In November, CNN surveyed 112 funeral homes across the island -- about half the total -- and found that funeral home staff believed at least 499 hurricane-related deaths had occurred. The Puerto Rico government added two deaths previously identified by CNN to its official toll. The official Hurricane Maria toll matters in part because families of those who died in the aftermath of the storm are eligible to have some funeral expenses covered by the US government. Experts say higher death tolls drive more disaster aid. And knowing precisely how and why people died can help authorities prevent future hurricane-related deaths.'They don't want to talk about it'An expert told CNN that the deaths of Cruz and Ruiz -- the men whose deaths were labeled as having been related to a \"cataclysmic storm\" -- appear to be related to the storm.\"It would be insane not to list those as hurricane-related,\" said Dr. Gregory J. Davis, director of the University of Kentucky's Forensic Pathology Consultation Service. CNN described Cruz's and Ruiz's cases to Davis over the phone. It's unclear, however, whether those deaths have been left off of the list of Maria victims because of an \"honest mistake,\" Davis said, or because officials wanted them kept secret. It's possible the forensics institute reviewed the deaths and found them not to be hurricane-related -- yet failed to update records accordingly, said Mario Marazzi, executive director of the Puerto Rico Institute of Statistics, an agency that also has sued for access to death records. It's also possible officials simply are withholding information, he said. \"I know they don't want to talk about it anymore -- since November, December,\" he said. \"Whether that's leading them to not account for everyone, I don't know.\"The most recent death on the government's list of 64 occurred on November 7 and four deaths on the list are not dated.Both Cruz and Ruiz died after November 7.Luis M. Cruz and Wanda Garcia at their home in Yabucoa, Puerto Rico. They cared for Ramon Cruz until he died.Miguel Angel Maldonado Santana died November 5 after a car accident in which he ran off a bridge in a location where street lights weren't working because power was still out after Hurricane Maria, according to his nephew, Geovani Lopez. He is labeled as a \"victim of cataclysmic storm\" and his death was reviewed by Puerto Rico's forensics office, which conducted an autopsy, records show. Yet he is not listed among the official hurricane deaths.In a fourth case, the circumstances were not as clear. Carmen Gonzalez Santiago's death on February 17 was not related to the storm, said Iliana Hernandez, her daughter. Gonzalez's doctor, Jose Perez Valentin, however, listed several \"causes\" of death, including a pulmonary embolism, which he told CNN was related to the fact that she was an older woman who was immobile after the hurricane. The storm is listed as a contributor to her death in government records. The words \"Hurricane Irma and Maria\" appear on her death certificate, which was signed by Perez Valentin.  Gonzalez's name does not appear on the official list of victims. 'He didn't want to cause us any trouble'In Yabucoa, Ramon Cruz died, according to his brother and sister-in-law, from complications that followed a fracture he suffered when a gust of wind during the hurricane slammed a balcony door into his body. Luis M. Cruz said he walked through the rubble of their town the day after the storm to find his brother still on the floor after the blow. Roads were blocked and there was no way to get medical attention for him, said Wanda Garcia, his sister-in-law. A week later, an ambulance was able to reach the home, she said, but Ramon Cruz refused to be transferred to a hospital in San Juan because of rumors of overcrowding and because he didn't want family members to be inconvenienced by the difficult trip, she said. \"He didn't want to cause us any trouble,\" Garcia said.JUST WATCHEDPuerto Rico must hand over death database ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPuerto Rico must hand over death database  01:50When Cruz was finally able to get help at a regional hospital, Garcia said, doctors told Ramon Cruz and his family that he might die during surgery because his health had deteriorated. Ramon Cruz was living with Hepatitis C but appeared healthy before the injury, which caused internal bleeding and eventually left him bedridden, according to relatives. Puerto Rico's mortality database lists only two \"causes\" of death for Cruz: \"victim of cataclysmic storm\" and \"fracture of neck of femur.\" The date of his injury is listed as September 20, the day Hurricane Maria hit this Caribbean island, which is a US commonwealth. Records show an autopsy was conducted but that it is \"unknown\" whether results are available. 'They were not numbers'Reinaldo Ruiz Cintron was working as a sub-contractor in hurricane cleanup efforts in Patillas, Puerto Rico, helping to clear roads, when a tree branch fell on him, breaking bones and leaving him hospitalized for a month, said Lisa De Jes\u00fas, his friend. Ruiz had health issues before the injury, she said, but she is certain he would be alive if he hadn't been injured in the cleanup. The \"causes\" of death listed for Ruiz are \"victim of cataclysmic storm,\" \"unspecified injury of trunk, level unspecified\" and \"injury, unspecified,\" Puerto Rico's records show.Well before the storm, De Jes\u00fas said, Ruiz was the kind of person who would do anything to help others. Ruiz became friends with the family after De Jes\u00fas' husband borrowed gas money from him, she said. After the hurricane, Ruiz cleared roads and helped neighbors before finding employment doing that, she said, eventually taking a job clearing debris. \"He just wanted to help out,\" De Jes\u00fas said. \"He wanted to help his town get back together -- for people to be able to (get to work) without hurting themselves.\" De Jes\u00fas says it is unjust Ruiz does not appear on the list of 64 hurricane deaths. \"They were not numbers, they were people,\" De Jes\u00fas said. \"And the government thinks that just putting a Band-Aid on things, it's all OK. But, no. What about our feelings? What about those people who died trying to put Puerto Rico back (together) again? People needed (electricity) because they had oxygen (machines). They were ill, they had cancer. They had other issues, health-wise. They needed the government, and the government failed them.\" She shared Ruiz's story, she said, so \"at least someone will know he existed.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Two years ago, Brendan Tyne pleaded with the Food and Drug Administration to approve a drug that he was hopeful could finally bring his mother some peace.  She could no longer move without assistance and had fallen victim to the debilitating and frightening psychosis that haunts many people with Parkinson's disease. \"She thinks there are people in the house and animals are trying to get her,\" he told an FDA advisory committee. He believed that a new medication called Nuplazid, made by San Diego-based Acadia Pharmaceuticals, was the answer.  Nuplazid's review was being expedited because it had been designated a \"breakthrough therapy\" -- meaning that it demonstrated \"substantial improvement\" in patients with serious or life-threatening diseases compared to treatments already on the market. Congress created this designation in 2012 in an effort to speed up the FDA's approval process, which has long been criticized for being too slow. Around 200 drugs have been granted this designation since its creation.  Read MoreStill, to recommend approval, the advisory committee would have to find that the drug's potential benefits outweighed its risks for its intended patients. Some FDA officials concluded that Nuplazid's public health benefit was enough to merit approval of the drug. Their argument echoed the pleas of family members and caregivers like Tyne: It could possibly help patients with no other alternative. Several of the people who spoke said their loved ones had been transformed during the clinical trials, though some said there was no way for them to know whether they were on Nuplazid or a placebo.  But the physician who led the FDA's medical review, Dr. Paul Andreason, warned that patients taking the drug during the company's clinical trials experienced serious outcomes, including death, at more than double the rate of those taking the placebo. The company's limited testing, he said, had not convinced him that the benefits outweighed the risks. I remember leaving really, really frustrated\nFDA advisory committee member \nWhile Tyne had heard about these risks, he said he \"discounted death as a real statistical possibility\" and was willing to try anything to help his mother.  \"I have two young children who love their grandmother,\" he told the committee. \"If nothing is done to bring her back to some semblance of normalcy, my children will never remember their grandmother for who she is: a loving, funny, caring woman who has improved the lives of all of the loved ones who surround her. Please, I beg you, do not deprive my children and their grandmother of experiencing that love.\" 'You have to take it seriously' The committee voted 12-2 and recommended that the FDA approve Nuplazid for the treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis based on a six-week study of about 200 patients. Three previous studies of the drug did not show that it was effective, Andreason said in his medical review, though they showed similar risk.    Even some committee members who voted in favor of the drug expressed reservations, according to the hearing transcript. \"I guess I'm hoping that the risks are going to be small, and I think the benefits for some of these people who are very sick and whose families are affected by this, I think they're probably willing to take that risk,\" one physician stated. Another committee member said she wouldn't have voted for the drug's approval if there had been a safe and effective alternative on the market. A third made a \"plea\" to the FDA to \"consider a large observational study so we can ensure that, once it goes into real-world use, that the benefits will outweigh the risks.\"   It hit the market in June 2016. As caregivers and family members rushed to get their loved ones on it, sales climbed to roughly $125 million in 2017. Tyne got his mother on the drug as soon as it became available. But after trying it for months, he says he was devastated to see that it was doing nothing to halt the awful progression of the disease, and her hallucinations became more frequent and harder to manage. \"She has gone straight downhill to the point she really can't function at all,\" he said.   Shortly after the drug's release, patients' family members, doctors and other health care professionals started reporting \"adverse events\" possibly linked to the medication -- including deaths, life-threatening incidents, falls, insomnia, nausea and fatigue. In more than 1,000 reports, patients continued to experience hallucinations while on Nuplazid.Creatures like cats and snakes can haunt patients with Parkinson's disease psychosis, as shown in Acadia's TV commercial.In November, an analysis released by a nonprofit health care organization, the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, warned that 244 deaths had been reported to the FDA between the drug's launch and March 2017. The organization also noted that hundreds of reports suggested the drug was \"not providing the expected benefit\" or potentially worsening the condition. Tracked by the FDA, these so-called \"adverse event reports\" document deaths, side effects and other issues, and can be made directly by consumers, caregivers and other medical professionals. Reports are submitted to either the FDA or to the drugmaker, which is required to pass along any it receives to the federal government. In some cases, the person filing the report is convinced the side effects were caused by the drug; in others, the reporter ascribes no cause but notes that the patient was on the drug. An adverse event report does not mean that a suspected medication has been ruled the cause of harm and is typically not the result of an official investigation. But the FDA uses the information to monitor potential issues with a drug and can take action as needed -- updating a medication's label, for instance, or restricting its use or pulling it off the market.    After analyzing the adverse event data for Nuplazid, the Institute for Safe Medication Practices concluded that this batch of reports \"reinforces the concerns of those who warned that (Nuplazid) might do more harm than good.\" Thomas Moore, senior scientist for drug safety and policy for the nonprofit, said the deaths are an \"important warning signal\" and warrant further review by the FDA -- and possible action, depending on what the review finds.Since the institute released its analysis, FDA data shows that the number of reported deaths has risen to more than 700. As of last June, Nuplazid was the only medication listed as \"suspect\" in at least 500 of the death reports. This is almost unheard of to have this many deaths reported...you have to take it seriously.\nDiana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research \nPhysicians, medical researchers and other experts told CNN that they worried that the drug had been approved too quickly, based on too little evidence that it was safe or effective. And given these mounting reports of deaths, they say that more needs to be done to assess Nuplazid's true risks.\"This is almost unheard of, to have this many deaths reported,\" said Diana Zuckerman, founder and president of the nonprofit thinktank the National Center for Health Research, adding that because reports are voluntary, potential problems may be underreported. \"You just don't see this with most new drugs -- you don't see all these reports -- so you have to take it seriously.\"Acadia and the FDA maintain that the medication's potential benefits continue to outweigh the risks and help fill a desperate need. Psychosis affects up to 50% of the roughly one million Americans suffering from Parkinson's disease, according to the FDA, and Nuplazid is the first drug to be approved to treat this specific condition.   Acadia said there are a number of reasons for the higher volume of death reports. Parkinson's disease psychosis is more commonly seen in patients in the most advanced stages of the disease, meaning they are already at a high risk of death. Plus, the company distributes Nuplazid through a network of specialty pharmacies that allow them to be in more frequent contact with both patients and caregivers -- meaning it is more likely to receive reports of death, which it is required to pass along to the FDA.\"If you are actively and regularly engaging patients and/or caregivers, it is inevitable that you will see a higher number of adverse events reported, especially in an older, chronically ill patient population,\" the company said in a statement.Read Acadia's full response here    It said its \"benefit/risk assessment of Nuplazid remains unchanged,\" and it carefully monitors and regularly analyzes safety reports from both ongoing studies and adverse event reports. The company noted, for example, that since the drug's approval, two studies of a total of more than 300 patients with Alzheimer's disease did not find a difference in the number of deaths reported between Nuplazid and the placebo.  The company also provided CNN with a statement from Dr. Joseph Jankovic, professor of neurology and an expert on movement disorders at Baylor College of Medicine. \"I have accumulated a great deal of experience with this drug,\" Jankovic said in the statement. \"While not all patients are completely satisfied, many of my patients have experienced marked improvement in their visual hallucinations, paranoia and other psychotic symptoms.\" In an interview this week, FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb was asked by CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta about his thoughts on drugs that receive expedited reviews and then prompt concerns about safety once they become available, like Nuplazid. While Gottlieb didn't want to comment on a specific product, he said he is \"familiar with the circumstances\" and that it's very important for the agency to make sure it is \"appropriately balancing\" safety with medical need. He said this is a flexible standard, however, and there may be more tolerance for risk in situations where there is a significant need and patients don't have an alternative.  JUST WATCHEDFDA chief: Opioids are biggest crisis we faceReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFDA chief: Opioids are biggest crisis we face 03:54\"You've seen us take regulatory action recently in the post-market setting to limit the use of drugs when new safety concerns became known,\" he said.The FDA told CNN it will continue to monitor the adverse event reports and review the drug's safety. It added that Nuplazid's \"complex safety profile,\" recognized at the time of its approval, resulted in a requirement that the medication carry a number of warnings on its label so that doctors could analyze potential risks and benefits before prescribing the drug.    The cases reported so far, according to the FDA, typically involved elderly patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease who suffer from numerous medical conditions and often take other medications that can increase the risk of death.    \n\n\n\nWhat should we investigate next?\n\nEmail Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken\n\n\n\"Based on these data, the FDA has, at this time, not identified a specific safety issue that is not already adequately described in the product labeling,\" the agency said in a statement.   The FDA has required antipsychotics to carry its most severe \"black box\" warning for the treatment of elderly dementia patients, after studies found that the medications increase the risk of death in this population. Between 50% and 80% of Parkinson's patients experience dementia as the disease worsens, according to the Alzheimer's Association. Because Nuplazid is a new kind of antipsychotic that targets a different receptor in the brain, its maker claims it comes with fewer toxic side effects. Even so, Nuplazid also carries a black box warning.    Related: The little red pill being pushed on the elderlyGeriatric psychiatrist and former FDA medical officer Susan Molchan said that the number of deaths is alarming and questioned whether patients and their families are aware of the risks associated with the drug.    To determine the true risks of Nuplazid, the researchers interviewed by CNN said, the FDA needs to require further scientific studies -- and not just rely on the reports, which are challenging to interpret and are not systematically collected. They also worried that, because the drug was already approved, these studies and any action by the FDA could take years.   Hundreds of adverse event reports A CNN review of several hundred adverse event reports shows that the detail provided for each case varies widely and that thorough investigations are rarely conducted -- making it difficult to determine whether Nuplazid might have been involved in the deaths of already sick and elderly patients.   In these reports, the physicians who prescribed the drug sometimes suggest that their patients likely died from complications from Parkinson's rather than because of Nuplazid. In other cases, it's unclear when exactly the patient started or stopped taking the medication. And in yet others, family members and sometimes doctors are convinced the drug contributed to the deaths.  This is exactly what I thought I was going to happen.Dr. Paul Andreason, who led the FDA medical review of Nuplazid One report recounts the death of a 73-year-old woman in a long-term care facility who was taking Nuplazid. Just before 8 in the morning, a nurse noted that the woman was \"sleepy.\" Shortly after, she was found unresponsive and without a pulse. Paramedics were not able to revive her and, less than an hour after the nurse's visit, she was pronounced dead. While her physician didn't believe her death was \"related\" to Nuplazid, her husband was convinced that it had played a role and paid for an autopsy. It showed only that she had pre-existing heart issues and died of cardiac arrest.    Related: Sick, dying and raped in America's nursing homesIn another report, an 89-year-old man was taken off the drug after experiencing a significant decline. His doctor blamed Nuplazid for his deteriorating condition. The patient died weeks later. In a third report, a woman flagged her husband's death to the FDA after he was taken to the hospital due to dehydration. After he passed away, she said, she was told by \"someone at the hospital\" that the death was connected to his use of Nuplazid.      Acadia said it analyzed these reports and concluded that there \"is nothing to suggest a causal relationship to Nuplazid.\" Acadia calculated a mortality rate for Nuplazid, which it said was lower than what you'd see in the general population of Parkinson's disease psychosis patients covered by Medicare. It calculated this using deaths reported to the FDA and what it considered a conservative estimate of patients on the drug, along with Medicare claims data. However, multiple experts interviewed by CNN said that this is an unreliable calculation since it is comparing apples to oranges.   Widening the patient pool In the weeks after the Institute for Safe Medication Practices issued its report on the deaths, Acadia's stock price dropped by more than 20%. While many large investors remain bullish about the stock, some investment analysts have made public records requests to the FDA for the death reports.   Currently, Nuplazid can cost nearly $100 a day, according to wholesale pricing data from First Databank. That can add up to more than $30,000 a year for a single patient, though the amount a patient actually pays depends on factors including individual insurance coverage.   Acadia expects sales of Nuplazid to at least double this year.    Acadia's TV commercial shows how frightening Parkinson's disease psychosis can be.The company, meanwhile, is forging ahead with clinical trials in an attempt to get the medication approved for use in a larger patient population: patients who have dementia-related psychosis. In October, the FDA granted its coveted breakthrough designation for this potential use as well, meaning it will also undergo a speedier review process. While a doctor can legally prescribe a drug for any reason, insurance companies may not approve it for uses that are not FDA-approved. So FDA approval to treat dementia patients would likely result in Nuplazid being prescribed to a much wider population, concerned medical experts told CNN.    \"You would certainly hope they don't approve it for anything else,\" said Zuckerman of the National Center for Health Research, based on the current research and FDA adverse event reports. \"If they're going to approve it for another group of patients that is much, much larger -- that would be unconscionable.    \"That is something they should absolutely not do given these unanswered questions about risk.\"    'I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up' Roughly two years have passed since that FDA meeting, where family members and caregivers -- some of whom traveled there on Acadia's dime -- gathered with medical experts to debate the merits and potential risks of Nuplazid.Andreason, the physician who led the FDA's medical review of Nuplazid, no longer works for the agency. He said that while he stands by the warnings he made at the time, he understands that other antipsychotics used to treat Parkinson's patients also come with an increased risk of death and that, when patients have a debilitating disease like Parkinson's, physicians and caregivers may choose a medication that improves quality of life even if it could also shorten life expectancy.  He said that he was not surprised to hear about the reports of death.   Knowing what I know now -- that it didn't work at all -- I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up.\nSon of Parkinson's patient \n\"This is exactly what I thought was going to happen,\" he said. \"We were going to get a burst of reports of serious adverse events and deaths.\"  Dr. Stephanie Fox-Rawlings, a senior fellow at the National Center for Health Research who spoke against the drug's approval at the FDA committee meeting, recently told CNN she understands how desperate families in these situations are, but she does not think Nuplazid is the answer based on her review of Acadia's public research. She and Zuckerman said that, after previous studies didn't show it was effective, the drugmaker changed the way the medication's ability to improve psychosis was measured, which resulted in a positive outcome. Acadia said its studies have had different objectives and all of them have used \"consistent, appropriate, and validated assessment methodology.\"\"If patients know there is some level of benefit, they can judge their risk,\" said Fox-Rawlings. \"But if we don't even know that it does work, how do you even judge that? It's kind of a false hope.\"    Kim Witczak was the consumer representative on the FDA committee evaluating Nuplazid. She and the patient representative were the only two members to vote against its approval. She still can't believe it's on the market.  \"I remember leaving really, really frustrated,\" she said.    CNN reached two of the three family members who petitioned for Nuplazid's approval at the meeting, despite having had no experience with the drug or its clinical trials, to ask whether they tried the medication once it hit the market.   One of these was Elaine Casavant. Despite the \"staggering cost\" of the medication, she said, she was quick to get her husband on it. But after three months, he showed no improvement and they stopped the medication. She has heard success stories, however, and remains optimistic that the drug could be helping certain people.  The other person was Tyne. The 43-year-old New Jersey resident works in New York and visits his mother every weekend at a nursing home in the Bronx. Tyne has attempted to move on from the disappointment of Nuplazid, but he still gets frustrated talking about it.   \"Knowing what I know now -- that it didn't work at all -- I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up,\" he said.  But he doesn't regret trying.    \"If there was something that could possibly help my mom and I didn't do it, I wouldn't be able to look at myself in the mirror.\" Do you have information to share about Nuplazid or other drugs targeting the elderly?

In a letter sent to Kelly Friday and obtained by CNN, the lawmakers said Trump's immigration policies \"endanger longstanding US protections for immigrant victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, human trafficking, and other crimes\" and \"reduce the likelihood that victims will report crimes they experience or witness.\"\n\n\nRead the letter \n\n\nThe group, led by Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat, and Florida Republican Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, sought answers from Kelly on how the executive orders changed immigration authorities' policies on detaining crime victims and witnesses.Key points in Trump's immigration executive ordersKelly's department oversees several agencies, including US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), that enforce federal immigration laws and policies.In an interview with CNN, Jayapal said the letter was inspired by recent reports of ICE agents apprehending domestic violence survivors at courthouses.Read MoreIn February, ICE agents detained an undocumented woman at the El Paso County Courthouse while requesting a protective order against an allegedly abusive ex-boyfriend. Last month, top judges from California and Washington wrote to Kelly about reports of immigration officials appearing at courthouses.  \"Immigration agents appear to be stalking undocumented immigrants in our courthouses to make arrests,\" California Supreme Court Chief Justice Tani G. Cantil-Sakauye said. \"I respectfully request that you refrain from this sort of enforcement.\"Judge on ICE arrests: 'Courthouses should not be used as bait'Immigration and survivor advocates have argued that the presence of ICE agents at courthouses threatens to adversely impact victims and witnesses, undermining local law enforcement's ability to investigate and prosecute violent crimes.In recent weeks, some local officials have reported a decline in the number of Hispanic victims reporting crimes.In March, Los Angeles Police Department Chief Charlie Beck said rape reports among Latino residents had dropped 25% compared to the same period last year. Houston police chief Art Acevedo said earlier this month that rape reports were down 42% in the Latino community compared to last year.JUST WATCHEDCops: Abuse victims scared of deportationReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCops: Abuse victims scared of deportation 03:06\"This is not a partisan issue,\" Jayapal said. \"We all understand that, particularly for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, we have to have the ability for them to come forward and not fear that they are going to somehow suffer some kind of a consequences because of their immigration status.\"Thirty-nine Democrats and two Republicans \u2014 Ros-Lehtinen and Florida Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo \u2014 signed onto the letter, according to Jayapal's office.Jayapal said Trump's \"vilifying of immigrants\" makes it difficult for Republican colleagues to speak out on undocumented crime victims.\"It's the demonization that makes it very difficult even for some Republicans to maybe step forward when maybe they would agree with these ideas,\" she said. \"That's troublesome to me.\"\"We need to be able to come together on some things that have always been core principles.\"Federal authorities at DHS and its agencies have argued they have every right to arrest undocumented immigrants at courthouses, especially in sanctuary cities that do not let them make arrests in jails, and that courthouses are preferable to making arrests in communities because they are controlled environments with security screenings. They have also denied going after individuals who do not have some other reason to be targeted besides being here illegally -- such as criminal records or final orders for deportation.DHS has not yet issued a response.",

        "content": "(CNN)President Donald Trump's criticism of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals as having a terrible record for being overturned leaves out several crucial facts.First of all, the judge who blocked Trump's executive order threatening to cut federal funds to sanctuary cities is not on the 9th Circuit Court. William H. Orrick is a federal district judge based in San Francisco. The 9th Circuit, encompassing nine West Coast states, reviews Orrick's decisions, but it hasn't yet.\nNext, it's true that the Supreme Court last term overturned 80 percent of the cases it heard from the 9th Circuit. But that was only 8 reversals out of 10 cases (One additional case was a 4-4 split and so affirmed.) The 9th Circuit decided 11,798 cases in that time span. So the actual rate of reversal was 7 out of every 10,000 cases.District judges overseen by the 9th Circuit decided 56,605 cases in that time span, about 20% of all cases decided nationwide. So their reversal rate at the Supreme Court is infinitesimal.\nThe 9th Circuit's reversal rate is not out of line with its peers. In the past ten years, the 6th Circuit, which covers Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee, has actually had the most reversals at 84%, according to Scotusblog. The 9th Circuit ranked third with 77% reversals, but the average for all circuit courts was 70%.Read MoreFinally, despite arguments that the district court judges overseen by the 9th Circuit are unusually liberal, 54% of them there were appointed by Democrats while 46% were appointed by Republicans, according to the Federal Judicial Center.\n\nFirst the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities-both ridiculous rulings.

(CNN)My daughter occasionally goes on a hugging and kissing strike. She's 7, and she's been holding these wildcat strikes since she was 3 or 4. Her parents can get a hug or a kiss, but many people who know her cannot, at least not all the time. And I won't make her. \"I would like you to hug Grandma, but I won't make you do it,\" I first told her three years ago. \"I don't have to?\" she asked, cuddling up to me at bedtime, confirming the facts to be sure. Under cover of goodness: How pillars of the community can prey on kidsNo, she doesn't have to. And just to be clear, there is no passive-aggressive, conditional, manipulative nonsense behind my statement. I mean what I say. She doesn't have to hug or kiss anyone just because I say so, not even me. I will not override my own child's currently strong instincts to back off from touching someone who she chooses not to touch. Read MoreI figure her body is actually hers, not mine.It doesn't belong to her parents, uncles and aunts, school teachers or soccer coach. While she must treat people with respect, she doesn't have to offer physical affection to please them. And the earlier she learns ownership of herself and responsibility for her body, the better for her. I shuddered at stories of Josh Duggar's \"inappropriate touching\" of his sisters, accusations that Bill Cosby sexually assaulted women after drugging them and Jerry Sandusky, the former Penn State football coach convicted of sexually abusing young boys. And they strengthen my resolve to teach my kid that it's OK to say no to an adult who lays a hand on her -- even a seemingly friendly hand.A teacher in California is explaining the concept of consent to her third-graders with a simple chart\"When we force children to submit to unwanted affection in order not to offend a relative or hurt a friend's feelings, we teach them that their bodies do not really belong to them because they have to push aside their own feelings about what feels right to them,\" said Irene van der Zande, co-founder and executive director of Kidpower Teenpower Fullpower International, a nonprofit specializing in teaching personal safety and violence prevention. \"This leads to children getting sexually abused, teen girls submitting to sexual behavior so 'he'll like me' and kids enduring bullying because everyone is 'having fun.' \"Protection against predatorsForcing children to touch people when they don't want to leaves them vulnerable to sexual abusers, most of whom are people known to the children they abuse, according to Ursula Wagner, a mental health clinician with the FamilyWorks program at Heartland Alliance in Chicago. None of the child victims of sexual abuse or assault she's counseled was attacked by strangers, she said.Only these 8 states require sex education classes to mention consentSometimes a child picks up on something odd about your brother-in-law that no one knows. Maybe he isn't a sexual predator. Maybe he has no sense of boundaries. Maybe he tickles too much, which can be torture for a person who doesn't like it. Or he may be a predator. \"It sends a message that there are certain situations (when) it's not up to them what they do with their bodies,\" Wagner said. \"If they are obligated to be affectionate even if they don't want to, it makes them vulnerable to sexual abuse later on.\"Why wait until there's trouble? Parenting coach Sharon Silver worked hard to cultivate her children's detector. Silver says her sons easily pick up on subtle clues that suggest something isn't quite right about particular people or situations.In your child's case, it may be that something's off about Aunt Linda or the music teacher down the street. \"It's something inside of you that tells you when something is wrong,\" Silver said. Training your child to pay attention to those instincts may protect him or her in the future. Having sex to please someone elseThe 'Show Dogs' controversy and the problem of teaching children consentWould you want your daughter to have sex with her boyfriend simply to make him happy? Parents who justify ordering their children to kiss grandma may say, \"It's different.\" No, it's not, according to author Jennifer Lehr, who blogs about her parenting style. Ordering children to kiss or hug an adult they don't want to touch teaches them to use their body to please you or someone else in authority or, really, anyone.   \"The message a child gets is that not only is another person's emotional state their responsibility but that they must also sacrifice their own bodies to buoy another's ego or satisfy their desire for love or affection,\" Lehr said.\"Certainly no parent would wish for their teenager or adult child to feel pressure to reciprocate unwanted sexual advances, yet many teach their children at a young age that it's their job to use their bodies to make others happy.\"We can't be rudeWill #MeToo be a turning point for younger girls, too?You might think my daughter's shiftless parents are not teaching her manners, but that's not true. She has to say \"please\" and \"thank you,\" set the table, clear her dishes and thank everyone and everything that makes her meals possible. She has be polite when greeting people, whether she knows them or not. When family and friends say hello, I give her the option of \"a hug or a high-five.\" Since she's been watching adults greet each other with a handshake, she sometimes offers that option. We talk about high-fives so often she's started using them to meet anyone, which can make the start of any social occasion look like a touchdown celebration.\"When kids are really little and shy, parents can start to offer them choices for treating people with respect and care,\" van der Zande said. \"By age 6 or 7, even shy kids can shake somebody's hand or wave or do something to communicate respect and care. Manners -- treating people with respect and care -- is different than demanding physical displays of affection.\"It creates more workRefusing to order her to hand out hugs or kisses on demand means there's more work to keep the relationships going and keep feelings from being hurt. Most of our extended family live far away, so it's my job to teach my kiddo about people she doesn't see on a daily basis.

We know that 60% of workers with jobs that can be done from home say they'd like to work from home most or all of the time when the pandemic is over, if given the choice, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. That's up from 54% in 2020.How should you decide whether to keep wearing a mask? Our expert weighs inBut what if you want to go back or are required to go back into the office? How should people consider the safety of going back to the office and other in-person work environments? Should they continue to mask, even if it's not required? Is it safe to sit in conference rooms? What about the risk of taking buses and trains? And are there work circumstances that people should try to avoid?To guide us through return-to-work questions, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of \"Lifelines: A Doctor's Journey in the Fight for Public Health.\"CNN: What are factors people should consider if they need to return to in-person work?Read MoreDr. Leana Wen: I'd encourage people to think about three factors. First, what is their medical circumstance and the circumstances of others in their household? If they are vaccinated, boosted and generally healthy \u2014 as is everyone else who lives with them \u2014 then their risk of severe illness due to Covid-19 is very low.Second, what's the level of Covid-19 in their community? The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new metrics, along with an easy-to-understand color-coded chart with data that are entered in real time. As we discussed in last week's Q&A, you can think of this new CDC tracker the same way as you would the weather forecast. If the level of Covid-19 is high, consider using additional protective measures and make sure to wear a mask. If the level is low, the risk of contracting the coronavirus is lower and you may decide to use fewer layers of protection.Third, what are the conditions in your work environment \u2014 what safety precautions are already being taken? Some offices require proof of vaccination. Because those unvaccinated are three to five times more likely to be infected with Covid-19 compared with those who are vaccinated and boosted, I would feel better protected in an environment where you know that colleagues around you are vaccinated.Other conditions include whether there is regular testing. Testing that's done at least once a week can help catch early, asymptomatic Covid-19 cases and serve as an additional layer of protection. Distancing and ventilation add protection, too. There is greater risk if you are in close proximity to a lot of colleagues in a small space, versus if you are in a large room with good ventilation.CNN: Should people mask at work, even if they aren't required to?Wen: Thinking through the three factors above will help in making this decision. If you or someone in your household is immunocompromised, you may decide to continue masking at work, especially if your area has high Covid-19 levels and you are in a work environment where you are in close proximity to others. On the other hand, if you are generally healthy and vaccinated and boosted, and you live in an area with low or medium Covid-19 levels, it would be reasonable to be unmasked. The work conditions can also shape this decision. For example, if everyone around you is known to be vaccinated and you are well spread out, that could also make it safer to unmask.New York City office workers wait in line to enter Goldman Sachs headquarters in June 2021. The company has required Covid-19 vaccination for entry since August 24, 2021.You could also use the mask in some work settings and not others. Maybe you sit in an area that's far away from others \u2014 you could unmask there, but then put on your mask when you are on the elevator or go to the restroom. Maybe you don't quite feel comfortable unmasking yet because your area is medium risk according to the CDC. You could wait to do so once the level falls to low risk. CNN: What kind of mask would you recommend that people wear? Are cloth masks enough?Wen: No. If you are going to mask, I'd urge that you wear the highest-quality mask \u2014 N95, KN95 or KF94. Make sure that the mask fits you well and that it's comfortable enough that you could wear it for the length of time that's needed. A single-layer cloth mask won't provide nearly as much protection against the very contagious Omicron variant as a high-quality one.CNN: Say you want to be extra careful. Is it safe to sit in conference rooms with others if they are all unmasked?Wen: A high-quality N95 or equivalent mask protects you very well. Even if others are unmasked, the risk of your contracting Covid-19 is low if you wear the mask consistently.Face masks expired? How to tell, plus why you should hold onto them despite easing restrictionsThis is not to say that everyone needs to be masked when in a conference room. Again, this depends on your medical situation, how much Covid-19 is in your area, and the circumstances of your workplace. It may be very reasonable for many employees to go unmasked in conference rooms if others around them are vaccinated, for example, or if the risk of Covid-19 in their area is low. There will be many different considerations going forward, and everyone needs to make the best decision for themselves, understanding that very few situations will have zero risk.  CNN: What about the commute \u2014 is it safe to now take the bus or train?Wen: Yes, it is, if you wear an N95 or equivalent mask the entire time. For much of the pandemic, we talked about masks as protecting others. Now, we know that a high-quality mask protects the wearer. Make sure to wear the mask during the entire commute, and don't eat or drink unless absolutely necessary.Do wear a mask while commuting on public mass transit, CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen said. A commuter boards a Bay Area Rapid Transit train in San Francisco on March 4. CNN: Are there work circumstances that people should try to avoid? Wen: This still depends on the individual and the circumstances involved. Someone who is healthy, vaccinated and boosted, and in a low-transmission area can probably take part in all work activities with very low risk of severe illness. On the other hand, another person who is medically vulnerable and in an area with higher Covid-19 levels may want to take additional precautions.Sign up for CNN's Stress, But Less newsletter. Our six-part guide will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it. Consider not only the work environment itself but also the activities that take place around work. The office may be quite well spaced out and safe, but if colleagues are going out to drinks in a crowded bar, that introduces additional risk. Workers may have to be vaccinated, but not clients or visitors. Take these factors into consideration when deciding what additional precautions to follow.That doesn't mean you can't socialize with your coworkers. You may decide to avoid the crowded bar and suggest an outdoor setting for after-work socialization. Or you could go maskless around your colleagues who you know to be vaccinated but wear your mask when around those of unknown vaccination status. Remember that the mask is always available to you as an option, even if it's not required.  Wearing a high-quality mask still protects you. Of course, get vaccinated and boosted, too!",

        "content": "(CNN)The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released a new measure for determining Covid-19 community levels. According to these new metrics that now take into account hospitalizations and hospital capacity in addition to infection numbers, nearly 70% of the United States population resides in areas where masks are no longer required.New CDC Covid-19 metrics drop strong mask recommendations for most of the countryWhy did the CDC make this change? How can people make sense of the Covid-19 community level in their area? Should individuals still mask if they no longer are required to? What about kids in schools? And how should parents evaluate activities like sleepovers and playdates?To help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of \"Lifelines: A Doctor's Journey in the Fight for Public Health,\" and the mother of two young kids.The following conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.CNN: What changes did the CDC make to masking guidelines, and why did they make them?Read MoreDr. Leana Wen: Previously, the one measure the CDC used to determine whether people should mask was infection numbers -- the number of new diagnosed Covid-19 cases. In recent months, many experts have questioned whether this is still the best measure, especially because those vaccinated are much less likely to become severely ill.The CDC now takes three factors into account. The first two are measures of severity and hospital capacity: the number of new Covid-19 admissions per 100,000 population in the past seven days and the percentage of staffed inpatient beds with Covid-19 patients. Because hospitalizations lag behind infections, they kept the measure of infection in place as the third factor (the number of new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 population in the past seven days).A child wears a KN95 mask in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York state, on January 13.The CDC then categorizes the Covid-19 community level into three categories. Areas in green (low) or yellow (medium) no longer need to require masks. People can still decide to mask if they wish, especially if they are immunocompromised. Those in orange (high) areas should still mask.CNN: How can people look up the Covid-19 community level in their area? Wen: The CDC's website has a helpful tool where you can look up your location by state and then county. I recommend that people look up all the locations that are relevant to them, as many people may live, work and socialize in different areas. This is not unlike what we would do with a weather forecast: Before you decide how to dress for work and decide whether you need to wear a heavy coat or bring an umbrella, you look up what's going on around you.Here's my specific example. I live in Baltimore City, Maryland, and work both there and in Washington, DC. According to the CDC tool, both areas are in green. Many of my family's social contacts are in Baltimore County and Montgomery County, Maryland, and in Fairfax County, Virginia. All of these areas are in green, too. If I were going to a conference in, say, Los Angeles County, California, or Cook County, Illinois, I would look up that county to understand the level of risk and decide what kind of protective measures I'd take. Just like with a weather forecast, I'd recommend that people check these numbers regularly, because they could change.CNN: Should people be taking off their masks now that they aren't required to wear one?Wen: Not necessarily. Just because a mask mandate may be lifting in your area doesn't mean that you should go maskless. And just because the CDC has your area in green or yellow doesn't mean that it's suddenly safe. You could still become infected with Covid-19, and a high-quality mask (N95, KN95 or KF94) remains an important tool that can reduce your risk of infection.The CDC updated its mask guidelines. What to know about 'the highest level of protection'I would definitely advise that if you live in an orange area, follow the CDC guidance and continue masking in indoor, public spaces. If you live in a yellow area, it's still a good idea to mask, especially if you are in crowded, poorly ventilated locations. This is particularly important if you are immunocompromised or otherwise have chronic medical conditions that could make you more likely to have severe outcomes if you became infected with Covid-19. Those who live in green areas may still choose to mask. My recommendation is that immunocompromised people should mask when indoors around those of unknown vaccination status. Others should decide based on how much they want to avoid contracting Covid-19 and the importance of being unmasked.There are many people who think that as long as they are vaccinated and boosted and therefore unlikely to become severely ill from Covid-19, they want to resume pre-pandemic normal, including going maskless. Others want to avoid the possibility of long-haul Covid-19 and will still choose to mask in indoor public areas. This is a personal decision, and I think we need be very understanding of individuals who may still wish to mask for any reason going forward.CNN: What about kids in schools? Should they still mask even if they no longer have to?Wen: This will also depend on the family and their specific medical circumstances, tolerance of risk, and desire to go maskless. Kids are much less likely to become severely ill compared to adults, and I think many parents will make the decision that if everyone in their family is vaccinated and boosted, it's reasonable to go unmasked in schools. Many others may choose to keep masking as an additional level of protection, especially if someone in the household is medically vulnerable.Here's how to get free N95 masks from pharmacies or community health centersCNN: What about kids under 5? Should they keep masking?Wen: Again, it depends. My 4-year-old's school is going mask-optional this week. It aligns with CDC guidance, since our area is in green. I am fine with my son not masking in school. That's because the level of Covid-19 in our area is low; my son and his little sister are generally healthy, and my husband and I are vaccinated and boosted; and quite a few kids in his class recently had Covid-19, meaning that the number of people who could still get infected and then transmit it to him is pretty low.That said, I still would want my son to mask when in other indoor, non-school settings. When I take him to the grocery store, when we're on the train, when we're in church -- in these settings, he and I will still be masking. Other families will make different choices. For us, the benefit of him going maskless in school outweighs the risk of Covid-19 in that setting. In other settings, we prefer to continue to reduce risk.CNN: How should parents evaluate other activities like sleepovers and playdates?Wen: I'd evaluate them based on the CDC's three risk levels, and then think about the family's circumstances and risk tolerance. At the orange level, I'd consider cutting down nonessential social activities and try to move as many indoor activities to the outdoors as possible. Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.At yellow, it depends on the family's medical circumstances: If everyone is vaccinated and generally healthy, it's probably fine to resume many activities, while still working to reduce risk when possible. For example, parents might choose to allow sleepovers, but ideally ensure that everyone there is vaccinated; or go to the movies, but ask that their kids still mask during the movie. At green, there can be more latitude to have indoor playdates and sleepovers, understanding that the risk is still there but the benefit of the activity to your children might outweigh potential risks.",

        "content": "(CNN)The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidance last week that urges Americans to wear the highest quality mask they can wear consistently and that fits well. Specifically, they classify the masks by level of protection. \"Loosely woven cloth products provide the least protection, layered finely woven products offer more protection, well-fitting disposable surgical masks and KN95s offer even more protection, and well-fitting (National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety)-approved respirators (including N95s) offer the highest level of protection,\" the CDC recommendations read.Many public health experts have been urging this change for months, including CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen. I spoke with Wen to answer some common questions about masks. Wen is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of \"Lifelines: A Doctor's Journey in the Fight for Public Health.\"CNN: Why have you been urging the CDC to make this change in mask guidance?   Read MoreDr. Leana Wen: We've known for over a year that Covid-19 is airborne. Quality of mask matters when trying to prevent an airborne infection that's so highly transmissible. This is particularly important now that we have the extremely contagious Omicron variant. We should be empowering people to wear the right mask \u2014 the best mask \u2014 that protects them.CNN: What mask would you recommend people wear?When you should take a PCR vs. a rapid antigen testWen: In indoor, crowded settings, I highly recommend that people wear an N95, KN95 or KF94 mask. The N95 is the American standard; KN95 is the Chinese standard; KF94 is the Korean standard. They can all be highly effective in terms of how well they protect against Covid-19 transmission. The CDC emphasizes consistency, which are both very important. Some individuals will find these respiratory masks to be uncomfortable. I suggest that they try out different kinds of masks. Someone might find an N95 to be too constricting, but a KN95 to be fine. Others prefer the feel of a KF94. There are some that have elastic loops on the ears versus over the head, and different people have a preference there, too.An N95 respirator that's fitted well and worn consistently is a highly effective way to protect against Covid-19 spread, CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen said.CNN: What if someone doesn't find any of these masks comfortable?Wen: If someone really can't consistently wear a respiratory mask, they should double-mask. Consider wearing a medical-grade surgical mask, then put a well-fitting, finely woven cloth mask on top. CNN: How does someone know if what they're purchasing is real versus counterfeit?Wen: Buy masks from trusted sources. Project N95 is a national nonprofit that has links. Purchasing from the supplier directly \u2014 for example, 3M or Kimberly Clark \u2014 can also help reduce risk. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta has additional tips on how to spot counterfeit masks.The Biden administration is also making 400 million non-surgical N95 masks available to Americans for free starting next week. The masks should be made available at a number of local pharmacies and community health centers by early February. In related news, the federal government has also launched a website to send people free Covid-19 tests. People can order a maximum of four tests, which will be shipped to their homes. CNN: Should I look for an N95 with a valve or without one?Wen: I would advise that you look for N95s that do not have an exhalation valve. The ones with valves protect the wearer very well, but it's possible that if you are infected, virus particles could escape from the valve and infect others. The level of virus escape is pretty low, though; according to the CDC, N95s with an exhalation valve work about as well as surgical masks or cloth masks in terms of protecting others. So, if an N95 with a valve is the only one you can tolerate wearing, you should wear that, but it's not recommended above an N95 without a valve. And make sure to try KN95 or KF94s -- these might be even more comfortable for you.CNN: These respirator masks are expensive. Do they need to be thrown out every day?Wen: No, they can be reused. How many times they are reused depends on their condition and how often they're used. Someone who is using masks every once in a while to go to the grocery store might be able to reuse the same mask for weeks. Someone else who's using it the entire day for work might have to change them out every few days.Use common sense when deciding whether it's time to replace the mask. Throw it out if it's clearly dented and out of shape or if it's wet or soiled -- for example, if you sneezed in it.CNN: Do they need to be cleaned?Wen: No, and I do not recommend that you try to clean them. Spraying with sanitizer or water, or microwaving the mask, could damage the mask beyond repair.Some people are worried about the mask carrying virus on it. There's little evidence of surface transmission of Covid-19, but if you want to be extra safe, have two or three masks that you are using in rotation every day. When you are done with one mask for the day, put it into a plastic bag or container. Use another one the next day, then come back to the first mask. Remember that if it's soiled or damp, throw it out and use a new one.CNN: What about kids \u2014 can they also wear respirator masks?Wen: There are some KFN94s and KN95s available for children, but it's worth reminding people that fit is really important. Some children find them to be comfortable. If not, a surgical mask with a cloth mask on top would be a good alternative.CNN: There's a lot of uncertainty about what's going on with the Omicron variant and Covid-19 more generally. Is there at least certainty about the importance of masking? Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.Wen: Yes, masking is an important layer of protection -- especially when there is this much virus circulating. Know that even if others around you aren't consistently wearing masks, you can wear a high-quality mask that still protects you. I really want everyone to be upgrading our masks to the best mask that we can consistently wear, and wear them in indoor, crowded places.This story has been updated with additional information about N95s with exhalation valves.",

        "content": "(CNN)These days, it's much easier to contract the coronavirus as the highly contagious Omicron variant spreads worldwide. As people face this current reality, it's important to note that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recently changed its guidelines around isolation and quarantine. Many have questions about what to do if they or a family member ends up catching Covid-19.What if a child tests positive \u2014 how should parents and guardians care for that child safely? What if a parent has Covid-19 but their children don't? How long should someone be in isolation? When should people be tested? What if everyone in the family contracts Covid-19 \u2014 do they need to be isolated from one another?To answer your questions, I spoke with one of our experts, CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, who is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of \"Lifelines: A Doctor's Journey in the Fight for Public Health,\" and the mom of two young children.CNN: You've talked a lot about the difference between isolation and quarantine. What's the difference and why is it important?Dr. Leana Wen: There is a big difference, and it's important to distinguish the two. The guidance is very different, depending on if you're in isolation versus quarantine. Isolation is what you do when you are diagnosed with Covid-19. Quarantine is what you might have to do if you are exposed to Covid-19 but have not yet been diagnosed. The CDC has very different guidelines for isolation versus quarantine, so that's why the specific vocabulary is important.5 reasons you should not deliberately catch Omicron to 'get it over with'Read MoreCNN: A lot of families are facing situations where someone is testing positive. If one member of the family \u2014say a parent \u2014 gets diagnosed with Covid-19, what should they do next?Wen: That person should immediately isolate from others. The person who was just diagnosed with Covid-19 should be presumed to be potentially infectious. Everybody else in the family should also get tested immediately. It's possible that the person who tested positive was not the first person to contract Covid-19, and other members may also test positive.CNN: What if everybody tests positive? Do they need to isolate from one another?Wen: If everyone has Covid-19, they do not need to isolate from each other. That's because it's highly unlikely that they have different strains of coronavirus; they probably all got the same strain from one another, and they aren't going to reinfect each other so quickly. The entire family, of course, should be isolating from other people.CNN: What if it's a child who tests positive, and everybody else is testing negative? Who's going to care for the child?Wen: This is very difficult, especially if it's a younger child who can't care for themselves. I would look at the circumstances of the household. Let's say that there are two parents or primary caregivers, and both are vaccinated, boosted and generally healthy. Let's say that there is another child who is not vaccinated, and therefore at higher risk for severe outcomes from Covid-19 compared with one who is vaccinated.If a young child tests positive for Covid-19 and other family members are at high risk, having the child form a pod with one parent is an option, CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen advised.In that scenario, I'd recommend splitting up the household so that one parent cares for the child who has Covid-19 and the other one cares for the child who does not have it. The two different \"pods\" should not interact with one another during the isolation period. If possible, they shouldn't share any indoor space. They should sleep in different rooms, not share the same bathroom, and not get together indoors at all during this time. The parent caring for the child with Covid-19 should wear a mask when with the child to try to reduce the likelihood of getting infected themselves.Why you should upgrade your mask as the Omicron variant spreadsThe situation becomes more challenging if there is only one parent or caregiver. Ventilation \u2014 opening windows and doors when feasible \u2014 can help, as can very careful handwashing and masking.CNN: Does isolation mean that you must be inside the whole time? Can you still go out and get fresh air?Wen: Technically, isolation does mean that you have to be inside and away from others. However, this is where you can use common sense. If you live in a house, townhouse or apartment where you don't have to pass any shared space to get fresh air, you could go outside. Please be careful, stay very well-distanced from others, and do not share indoor space with people. None of us wants to infect others inadvertently.CNN: How long should someone be in isolation?Wen: The CDC's new guidelines essentially shorten the isolation period from 10 days to five days, with an additional five days wearing a mask. This means that you should stay fully isolated for the first five days. After that, you can go out \u2014 to work, to the grocery and so forth \u2014 but you should wear a high-quality, well-fitting mask when out in public. Don't go to settings where you will be maskless, such as restaurants.When it comes to people in the same family, this guidance means you really shouldn't have meals together or have other casual, maskless encounters with uninfected members of your family in the 10-day period. If families are in two pods, the two shouldn't mix for 10 days inside their house.What's safe for kids to do, with Omicron spreading quickly? An expert weighs inCNN: If someone had symptoms on Monday, got tested on Wednesday and then got results back on Friday, when does the five-day clock start?Wen: Monday. The five-day clock starts when someone first starts getting symptoms. If someone is tested and they are asymptomatic but have a positive result, the five-day clock starts when they first got the test. If you are unsure \u2014 for example, if you are feeling a little rundown Sunday but don't really have full symptoms until Tuesday \u2014 use the date that you are certain of the symptoms.Remember that the count starts at day zero. Day one is the first full 24 hours after the onset of symptoms or after the positive test. CNN: When should you get tested again?Wen: The CDC is not recommending testing to get out of isolation. What they are saying is that you can take a rapid antigen test at day five, but then if it's positive, you must keep isolating for another five days.I disagree here with the CDC. If you have rapid tests readily available, I think you can test starting day five. If it's negative on day five and negative the next day (day six), I think it would be reasonable to end isolation. This could be crucial for families, for whom being separated from one another is a major inconvenience. Importantly, a PCR test, while more accurate for initial diagnosis, is not the test to use after your diagnosis is already confirmed. That's because the PCR test is so sensitive that it picks up on small fragments of virus, and people infected with Covid-19 could still be testing positive by PCR weeks after they are no longer infectious.CNN: What about those who tested negative for Covid-19 initially? When should they get tested again?Wen: The CDC recommends that those individuals exposed to someone with Covid-19 get tested no sooner than five days after their exposure. The agency further breaks this down into whether you are vaccinated and boosted, versus if you are not. It also considers those who had Covid-19 in the past 90 days to be the same as if they are vaccinated and boosted. If you are not, you need to quarantine until a negative test result at least five days after and then wear a mask for five more days in public. If you are, then you do not need to quarantine, but you should still get a test in five days.Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.Here's where I would add a bit more nuance to the CDC guidance. First, if you have rapid tests readily available, I think it's reasonable to test family members every day. They may not be cleared from quarantine until at least five days later, but if they end up testing positive sooner, it would change how family members interact with one another. Perhaps the entire family is already exposed and will test positive in a day or two, which eliminates the need to separate one another. Second, even though the CDC says that those exposed do not need to quarantine if they are up to date on vaccines, employers and schools may have different guidance. Make sure to check with them before sending your kids or yourself back to school and work.",

If my kid is doing virtual learning, can we gather friends together? What if my child has a medical condition? Can I take my vaccinated child and their unvaccinated younger sibling to see friends?To answer your questions, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, who is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health.

Many would say yes. A lot of children have really suffered as a result of not having in-person instruction and are not doing well with remote learning. In addition, parents and caregivers may need school for childcare purposes so that adults can work. If in-person school is essential, there are ways to make it less risky. Then the question becomes, how can we do so in the safest way?Kids participate in a class activity at Houston's Xavier Academy on August 23, 2021. At the time this photo was taken, all staff and faculty had been vaccinated, and 90% of students in attendance had been vaccinated.CNN: What if the school isn't doing much to protect kids \u2014 for example, it doesn't require masks and there is no testing?Wen: Just like with every setting, there are different layers that all add protection. An ideal, lowest-risk situation employs all of them: All staff and students are vaccinated, mask-wearing is required, twice-weekly testing is available, and there is great ventilation.That's not the reality for most schools. That doesn't mean no kids can go to school until every criterion is met. Rather, you should do what's in your control to reduce risk. Even if others around you may not be vaccinated, your child being vaccinated protects him or her very well from severe illness due to Covid-19. A high-quality mask (N95 or KN95 are best) will protect your child, even if others aren't reliably or consistently wearing masks. Other measures like testing would be nice to have, but if they aren't available, the risk to your child can still be low with masking and vaccination.CNN: Is it OK to send my kids to school and do extracurriculars? Are there some extracurriculars that are safer than others?Wen: Here, I would ask another question: How important is it to your family that your child avoid Covid-19? Specifically, what are the medical circumstances of your household? If everyone in your household is optimally protected with vaccination and booster (if eligible for the booster), and people are healthy, you could decide that the risk of becoming severely ill from Covid-19 is very low. This is particularly relevant now, as Omicron is more than 95% of all infections in the United States, and growing evidence shows that this variant causes less severe illness for vaccinated individuals.5 ways adults can boost kids' well-being -- and their own -- as schools return from break in a Covid surgeMany families may decide that the price to actively avoid Omicron, given how contagious and prevalent it is, is too high. It would be reasonable for them to decide that their kids should participate in all the extracurricular activities they wish to.Other families may choose to be more cautious. Perhaps there is someone in the family who is immunocompromised. Perhaps there is an unvaccinated younger sibling, or they just don't want to get Covid-19 \u2014 there are some people who will pay a heavier price to avoid it.In the latter case, families could choose extracurriculars that are lower risk. Activities that could be done outdoors are much lower risk than indoors. Indoors, look for things where distancing is possible and where masks must stay on. Use common sense: Tennis is probably going to be safer than wrestling, and yearbook in a well-distanced classroom is probably going to be safer than choir practice in a small, cramped space. If your local ERs are very full, you might consider deferring activities that have a higher risk of injury. Or at least ask your kids to use additional caution, as you may otherwise have a very long wait to tend to the broken arm or get stitches!CNN: If my kid is doing virtual learning, can we gather friends to learn together?Wen: A lot of families did this last year and formed pandemic pods. It's an option this time around, too. It helps to define the rules of engagement. Is everyone vaccinated? Will everyone exercise a similar level of caution in other aspects of their lives (for example, not going to indoor restaurants)? Know that if you are in a pod, you are assuming one another's risks, and with how contagious Omicron is, if one person gets Covid-19, others will likely, too.CNN: What if there is a younger sibling who's under age 5 and not yet vaccinated? Can I take the whole family to the zoo outdoors or to the indoor movies, or just the vaccinated child? Wen: There are a lot of families that will look at the data around Covid-19 and decide that their young, unvaccinated child is at low risk for severe illness, and it's not worth taking many additional precautions to prevent them from getting infected. There will be others who want to be as cautious as is reasonable.Dr. Leana Wen explains the latest risks Omicron poses to families and childrenMy family is trying to take common-sense precautions with our two under-5 children. We are members at our local zoo and enjoy taking them on weekends. We stay away from crowds and only go to outdoor exhibits. I would not take our kids to the movies, where they could be surrounded by people who have their masks off to eat or drink.That's our decision, though, and I could see us making a different decision if we had an older child who was vaccinated and good about masking. In that case, perhaps that child could still go to the movies, and to playdates, if they kept on a mask, even if there is a younger, unvaccinated sibling.CNN: Speaking of individual circumstances, what about someone who has a child with diabetes, asthma or another underlying medical condition?Wen: Getting that child vaccinated will be key, as someone with underlying medical conditions is more likely to have severe outcomes from Covid-19 compared with someone who is otherwise healthy. Some families might decide it's still important for that child to have as much of a pre-pandemic, normal life as possible. Others might want to take additional precautions. I'd also speak to my pediatrician to assess the individual risk to my child.CNN: I'm still on the fence about vaccinating my children. Should I get them vaccinated?Wen: Yes. More than 6.5 million children 5 to 11 years old have received the Covid-19 vaccine, and more than 15.6 million kids 12 to 17 years old have as well. Studies have been so clear that the vaccines are highly protective against severe illness from Covid-19 and are very safe. Getting your children vaccinated allows them to return to many aspects of pre-pandemic life and gives your entire family more peace of mind.CNN: If my kid gets sick from the Omicron variant, what should I do? Wen: Anyone who tests positive for Covid-19 should immediately isolate. You should notify their day care or school. You should also test everyone else in your household right away. If all family members have Covid-19, they don't need to isolate from each other. But if there are some people in the house who are negative and some who are positive, those who have the coronavirus should stay separated from those who don't. There's one crucial step to your Covid self-test you may be missing, experts sayFollow guidance from your doctor, your local health department or school protocols, or the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for how long your child's isolation should be. During the isolation period, it's important not to have your child get together with their friends. They should generally stay at home. If they go outdoors to get fresh air, they should wear a mask and stay distanced from other people.CNN: What if everyone in the family is vaccinated and has already had Omicron? Do you have super immunity \u2014 and if so, shouldn't we try to get infected?Wen: It's probably true that someone who had been vaccinated and has now recovered from Omicron has additional protection. Reinfection with Omicron hasn't really been documented yet, and some studies suggest that infection with Omicron may protect against Delta. Sign up for CNN's Stress, But Less newsletter. Our six-part guide will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it. That said, I wouldn't advise that people try to catch Covid-19 on purpose. That's because hospitals are so overwhelmed. There is still a chance \u2014 though a very low chance \u2014 that a vaccinated person could become severely ill. You don't want to end up needing a hospital right now. For vaccinated people, it's reasonable to take basic precautions like masking in public, indoor places to reduce the likelihood of infection, while also resuming the aspects of life that you find the most important \u2014 which includes kids returning to school.",

        "content": "(CNN)It's time to be kind.It's World Kindness Day today, Saturday, November 13. After more than a year of pandemic living, maybe it seems like there is no time to be kind. The world, however, needs your kindness more than ever. People are still dying from Covid-19 and others are hungry and living in war-torn countries. And young people are in the streets claiming adults aren't paying enough attention to the climate crisis. There is time, and we'd need look no further than frontline workers still risking their lives every day to care for sick people, feed the hungry, teach our children and fight for our collective mental health. That's kindness. \"Selfless acts of kindness don't just help the person on the receiving end,\" said psychologist Lisa Damour, author of \"Untangled\" and \"Under Pressure\" and co-host of the \"Ask Lisa\" podcast, via email. Read More\"Research finds that altruistic behavior activates the very same regions in the brain that are enlivened by rewards or pleasurable experiences.\"Remarkably, helping others also causes the brain to release hormones and protein-like molecules, known as neuropeptides, that lower stress and anxiety levels. Here's the bottom line: doing good is good for you.\"Here are 25 ways to be kind to yourself, your family and community, and the planet today or any day.Be kind to yourselfKindness starts by being good to yourself. Stay hydrated to feel at your best.1. Start with yourself. Yes, you're at the top of this list. What is one simple thing you can do that fills you up? It may mean taking 15 minutes for a phone call with an old friend, shooting hoops or reading a book. It may be simply saying \"yes\" if someone offers to help. Stressed out? Try our Stress, But Less newsletter. 2. Get moving. You don't need to start a rigorous exercise program. You can start with walking or even a five-minute stress relief program, and then keep going. You can sign up for our Fitness, But Better newsletter to get more ideas. 3. Drink more water. It's recommended that women drink 72 ounces of fluids per day and men 100 ounces. Why not try adding one more glass of water per day and increase that number as you can.4. Eat better. Try eating the Mediterranean way, one of the healthiest ways to eat in the world. Not sure how to start? Sign up for our Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style newsletter. 5. Go to sleep earlier. Lack of sleep makes us more vulnerable to illness. Routine, cooler temperatures and a dark room are key to good sleep. Not sure what else you should do? Sign up for our Sleep, But Better newsletter.Make kindness a family valueStrengthen family ties by boogying to the beat together. Everyone can join in.6. Treat your sweetheart. Do something nice that makes your spouse happy -- take a walk together, make their favorite dish or load the dishwasher the way they like it or take the kids away so they can have solo time --  make a schedule, find a favorite wine, whatever is their love language. (And don't forget your anniversary.)7. Schedule teatime. Take time to make the family a restorative cup of tea or two. Frequent green tea drinkers were 21% less likely to develop depression over their lifetime than those who were nondrinkers, a 2018 study conducted in South Korea found.8. Host a family dance party. Have a family dance party to all sorts of music ('70s, anyone?) and show the kids you can salsa or boogie or slide with the best of them. 9. Phone a relative. So many grandparents are missing their children and grandchildren, so why not call a relative? And if you miss someone, you can call them, too.10. Heritage recipe hunt. Call the main chef in your family and ask her or him to walk you through a longtime family recipe. Then make it. If they claim you have to have a certain ingredient from the old country, ask for another recipe.  11. Talk to your children about race. Educating our children beyond their own identities will help them navigate the wider world in a thoughtful way. Start early with Ibram X. Kendi's board book, \"Antiracist Baby.\" Middle school children may like the young adult version of \"Born a Crime,\" Comedy Central host Trevor Noah's memoir of growing up in apartheid South Africa. Adults can dig into former Spelman College President Beverly Daniel Tatum's classic, \"Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria?\" Kindness in the communityShare a freshly baked treat from your kitchen with neighbors.12. Bake for a neighbor. My favorite neighbors stress bake and share their baked goods. Those last scones were so good, and scones go with tea (see above). There is still so much more to bake.13. Communicate your gratitude. Handwritten letters have become a sort of lost art, but there is nothing like receiving a handwritten note that shows care, intention and the reasons why someone loves and appreciates you. Think of the colleagues, friends and family members you cherish and why, then let them know. The simple things often mean the most.14. Grocery shop for someone who needs it. You may have neighbors who are housebound or could use a helping hand; food banks are seeing more people in need.  15. Hand out snack bags. Gather shelf-stable snacks, bottles of water, socks and wipes into bags to hand out to people who need them (be sure to do so safely from 6 feet away). 16. Support a local restaurant. Order a takeout meal this week from a local joint that needs your business. Empower people -- young and old -- in your community by helping them register to vote.17. Vote and register people to vote. Yes, it's true next year isn't a presidential election year. But the midterms matter, whatever your political party.Kindness for the EarthSupport your state park by taking a hike.18. Take a hike. Hiking any time of year is good for you and shows support for our parks and other public natural spaces. More than ever, we need nature.19. Buy food from farmers. Shopping at your local farmers markets or direct from farmers supports local businesses growing good food.20.  Volunteer in a litter cleanup: Organize or join a community cleanup of a local beach or neighborhood park.21. Reduce, reuse, recycle and compost. Even as single-use packaging might be piling up in your home -- and eventually landfills -- there are ways to reduce our footprint. 22. Turn off your lights. Just when you don't need them. So many of us are working from home, and that's quite the electric bill. Turning them off saves money and resources. Three more things23. Social distance. It's OK to sometimes see people if you stay apart (6 feet at least). Lawn chairs spread around a firepit sounds good right about now.24. Dress for the season and play outside. Whether you live where we're heading into winter (so bundle up) or summer (shorts weather), experts say it's good to get outside for our physical, mental and emotional health. 25. Wear a mask. It can be annoying or uncomfortable, but it signals to the world that you don't want to get other people sick or possibly kill them, and research shows it protects you, too.

Their younger kids will soon be much better protected against the coronavirus.But will it be in time for Thanksgiving? Will we be able to get together more easily because more kids are vaccinated? What precautions should we take? What if travel is required? And what about the kids who are too young to be vaccinated?I spoke with our expert, CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, who is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of a new book, \"Lifelines: A Doctor's Journey in the Fight for Public Health,\" and the mother of two young kids.CNN: I have heard from many parents who are so relieved their 5- to 11-year-old children can get the Covid-19 vaccine. Has that been your experience, too?Dr. Leana Wen: Relief, for certain, because so many parents have been worried about their children being exposed to the coronavirus at school. Parents have also been concerned about their own exposure at work, and inadvertently bringing back Covid-19 to their kids. A lot of families are making plans for what they will soon be able to do, once their entire household is fully vaccinated.Read MoreThere is a lot of envy, too! Envy from families like mine, with children under the age of 5 who still are not eligible yet. And there are still a lot of families that haven't yet gotten appointments for their children, because these have been filling up fast. More sites will be providing the vaccine for younger children soon, and I expect it will be a matter of weeks before every child that wants a shot can get easily get one. Kids receiving their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine now will be partially protected by Thanksgiving. An 8-year-old receives the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in Southfield, Michigan, November 5.CNN: Can families relax over Thanksgiving once their kids are vaccinated?Wen: Once the entire household is fully vaccinated, it would certainly be reasonable to resume many more activities and get back to something closer to pre-pandemic normal. A reminder, though, that fully vaccinated for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which is what's authorized for children, means two shots, separated by at least three weeks, followed by two more weeks to allow for optimal antibody production. Pediatrician or pharmacy? Expert weighs in on how to get a Covid vaccine appointment for your childGiven that the vaccine for 5- to 11-year-olds was just made available last week, these younger children are not going to be fully vaccinated in time for Thanksgiving. (The one exception will be the kids who were enrolled in the clinical trial who got the vaccine.)Most children who are getting their first doses now will have partial protection by Thanksgiving. I would not recommend that they behave as if they were fully vaccinated. Continue to exercise caution for the time being, especially because they are so close to being fully vaccinated.CNN: Does that mean families with younger children can't get together over Thanksgiving?Wen: No, not at all. It just means that parents shouldn't consider their kids fully vaccinated if they've only had one shot. Families with partially vaccinated kids need to continue taking additional precautions.If lots of people are getting together, especially with other unvaccinated people, the safest thing to do is to gather outdoors. If an indoor gathering is planned, I would advise that everyone reduce their risk and essentially quarantine for at least three days ahead of the get-together, and then get a Covid-19 test the day of the gathering. An over-the-counter, rapid antigen test is fine for this purpose.CNN: For those three days, what if kids have to go to school and adults have to go to work?Wen: It's hard for everyone to stop their lives prior to the get-together. I'd encourage people to do their best to reduce their risk in that period. People going to school and work where they will be around others of unknown vaccination status should wear high-quality masks when they are indoors. Do not go to crowded indoor bars or restaurants, or get together with other people, indoors, during that period.Putty and ice cream? A therapist's advice on how to talk to younger kids about the Covid vaccineThis method, of reducing risk then testing, isn't going to prevent all Covid-19 cases. At this point in the pandemic, most people are not aiming to eliminate all risk, but to reduce risk enough that we can bring back activities in our lives that are really important. That includes seeing loved ones over Thanksgiving.CNN: Should adults try to get their booster shots before Thanksgiving, if they are eligible? Would that also help to protect children?Wen: Adults who are recommended for booster shots should get their boosters by November 11 to protect themselves in time for Thanksgiving Day festivities. Studies show that boosters increase antibody levels and reduce the likelihood of breakthrough infections, so getting a booster before get-togethers over the holidays will help protect that person, and probably also those around them, too. CNN: What advice do you have for families who need to travel over Thanksgiving?Wen: Wear a high-quality mask when in indoor, public places. An N95, KN95 or KF94 are best. Try not to remove your mask, except for short sips of water. For younger children or individuals who need to eat more often, try to find a location away from others while eating. CNN: A lot of families have children of mixed vaccination status \u2014 some kids who are fully vaccinated, others who are just getting their first shots, and those still too young to get the vaccine. How should they handle the upcoming holidays?Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.Wen: The family should discuss the level of risk they are willing to take. It might be reasonable to allow a fully vaccinated teen to see her fully vaccinated friends for a sleepover, even if there is a younger child who is just now getting her shots. But parents could draw the line and say that the vaccinated teen is not able to attend an indoor concert where she'd be surrounded by a lot of unmasked people of unknown vaccination status. The children who are partially vaccinated should continue to take additional precautions for the time being, with the expectation that they will be fully vaccinated for the next set of holidays in December.",

        "content": "(CNN)Wait, are we taking a break from aspirin?While so much of our conversations around health is rightly focused on Covid-19, there are other health developments to discuss with our medical providers. The US Preventive Services Task Force announced new draft recommendations around aspirin use on October 12. The volunteer panel of disease prevention experts is advising that adults 60 and older to not start taking aspirin to protect their hearts unless they have had previous heart attacks or strokes. The task force also recommends that adults ages 40 to 59 who are at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease, but do not have a history of the disease, should speak with their doctor about whether to take aspirin for heart health.Higher stress levels raise blood pressure, risk of heart attack and stroke, study findsWhat's behind the changes? How does this affect you if you are already on aspirin? Who should consider taking aspirin?I turned to CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of a new book, \"Lifelines: A Doctor's Journey in the Fight for Public Health.\" Read MoreCNN: A lot of people take aspirin, thinking that it's harmless. But it seems there could be some risks, too.Dr. Leana Wen: That's exactly right. We need to keep in mind that virtually every medication or therapeutic has risks. In the case of aspirin, one possible side effect is an increased risk of bleeding. This is the big reason why the national task force is recommending a change in guidance for older individuals in particular. Older people have a higher risk of falls, and taking aspirin could increase the risk of bleeding in the brain if someone falls and hits their head. There is also an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding for people taking aspirin.CNN: Aren't there still benefits to taking a daily aspirin?Wen: Absolutely. Studies have consistently shown that regular aspirin use decreases the risk of heart attacks and strokes. The question for aspirin and all medications is whether the benefits outweigh the risks. There isn't a single, one-size-fits-all answer.There are clearly some individuals who are at high risk for having heart attack and stroke. For these people, specifically people with prior heart attacks or strokes, aspirin use continues to be recommended. There are others who may be at increased risk \u2014 for instance, people with hypertension, diabetes and other factors that predispose to cardiovascular disease. On a case-by-case basis, aspirin may still be recommended, depending on someone's age and other circumstances. Then there are some people on the opposite end of the spectrum, who may have bleeding disorders and probably should not be taking aspirin.I think what the task force is trying to say is that people shouldn't assume they need to be on aspirin. There needs to be a careful weighing of risks and benefits. CNN: What happens if someone is on aspirin now \u2014 should they stop?Wen: No. First, these are proposed, draft recommendations. They are going through a comment period now, and final recommendations are expected in November. As of right now, the recommendations have not officially changed.How to start the Mediterranean diet \u2014 meal by mealSecond, the authors of the draft guidelines specifically say that people shouldn't stop their aspirin if they are already taking them. There could be risks associated with suddenly stopping any medications, including aspirin.CNN: Should you talk to your doctor about whether you should be on aspirin?Wen: Yes, of course. It's always reasonable to have a conversation with your doctor about the medications you're taking.Most importantly, make sure your doctor is aware that you're taking aspirin. I've found that because aspirin is an over-the-counter medication, patients often don't mention they are taking it unless they are specifically asked. Please make sure your doctor knows you're taking aspirin, and any other nonprescription medication or dietary and herbal supplement. If your doctor is the one who recommended aspirin to you, you could still have a conversation. Make sure you understand why it is that you're taking it. Discussing risks and benefits of every medication is always a good idea, as is ongoing reevaluation. Just because something was recommended to you before doesn't mean that it's always going to be right, especially as your medical circumstances and clinical guidelines change.CNN: What if you're taking aspirin once in a while, for example, when you have a headache?Wen: There a lot of people who take aspirin or aspirin-containing products for headaches and other occasional ailments. Again, it's important to let your doctor know that you're taking it occasionally. There may be better remedies, and aspirin may interfere with other medications you're taking \u2014 for example, if you're taking other blood thinners or if you have, say, a stomach ulcer, it may not be advisable to take aspirin.Sign up for CNN's Stress, But Less newsletter. Our six-part guide will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it. In general, though, the draft recommendations are not directed at those taking aspirin occasionally. They are directed at people who are taking aspirin every day, who think that doing so is preventing heart attacks and strokes. Again, some people may still need to do this, but some may not.CNN: What if you haven't yet started on aspirin? Should you hold off before picking up a bottle at the store?Wen: Talk to your doctor before starting aspirin. I've found that many people start taking aspirin because they think it's the thing to do once they turn a certain age. That's not the case, and I think that's the most important takeaway from the guideline change. Aspirin is a medication like other medications. The risks and benefits need to be carefully considered and weighed, together with your medical provider.",

During difficult times, how do we keep the eye on the prize -- raising healthy and resilient children who can become strong and caring adults who, as my mother says, can pay the rent?

        "content": "(CNN)The pandemic is making me think about Halloween costumes and candy earlier than ever.I am also wondering what my busy block will be doing. Will the couple at the end of my street have the player piano going as they hand out treats? Or will they go dark, as they did last year, worried about spreading coronavirus if they participate? My family is now fully vaccinated, since my child is, amazingly, a teenager. But are we safe to wander out in our Halloween-crazed neighborhood? We don't know who is vaccinated among the 12 and older set, and the under 12 set cannot yet be vaccinated.I decided to ask CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen how to celebrate safely, whether your family is fully vaccinated or not. An emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, she is also author of a new book, \"Lifelines: A Doctor's Journey in the Fight for Public Health.\" And she is the mother of two young children.CNN: Let's get to the most important question -- is it safe to go trick-or-treating this year?Read MoreDr. Leana Wen: Yes! I plan to go trick-or-treating with my kids.To be sure, as with most things at this stage in the pandemic, I don't mean that everything is exactly back to 2019. People should still take precautions this Halloween, especially if their kids, like mine, are too young to be vaccinated (my son is 4 and my daughter is 1 1/2).Why a Covid-19 vaccine for younger children is taking longer than a vaccine for adultsTrick-or-treating can be pretty safe from a coronavirus standpoint. Many families in my neighborhood will be placing packets of treats in their yards for kids to find, like a scavenger hunt. My son and a couple of friends will be walking around together, with everyone's parents, of course, and this activity is very safe.There are a lot of people who want to return to pre-pandemic days and greet the kids as they say \"trick or treat.\" If it's not raining or snowing, I'd encourage them to set up outdoors. It's better to put wrapped candies in a kid's basket than for kids to be reaching into a large bowl. If the kids do end up touching each other's hands or other commonly used surfaces like doorknobs, make sure to have hand sanitizer available.If you live in an area with individual houses or townhomes, I think it's probably also low risk to knock on people's doors and trick or treat. Just make sure not to step inside someone's house. If you live around a lot of apartment blocks and have to enter elevators and hallways to trick or treat, the Covid-19 risk is significantly higher. I'd encourage parents not to enter other people's apartment buildings, and instead, look for activities in a neighboring park or other primarily outdoor settings.Pumpkin spice really does give you the warm fuzzies \u2014 here's the science of whyCNN: Are there other Halloween activities that you would encourage kids, particularly younger, unvaccinated kids, to stay away from?Wen: In general, I'd encourage unvaccinated kids to stay away from indoor parties. Coronavirus transmission is still at very high levels in many parts of the country, and children now constitute more than a quarter of new infections. Indoor activities remain high risk. Luckily for our kiddos, outdoor trick-or-treating is the safest activity, and candies are individually wrapped. CNN: What about kids who are older and already fully vaccinated?Wen: I think parents should have a conversation about their kids as to what level of risk they are willing to take as a family. There may be some families where everyone is generally healthy and vaccinated. The risk of any of the family members getting severely ill in that case is low. It may be reasonable to decide that an indoor get-together with friends is fine -- especially if all the friends and their parents are also vaccinated. The same goes for activities like the movies, a dance or a haunted house. All of these activities will have some degree of risk. The risk increases with higher community transmission rates, larger numbers of attendees, and crowded, poorly ventilated spaces. Wearing a mask when indoors, around people of unknown vaccination status, is always a good idea to reduce the risk of contracting and spreading Covid-19.'How to Raise Kids who Aren't Aholes' \u2014 or maybe even kindJust as there will be some families that are willing to take on some of these risks, there are other families that want to take additional precautions. Some families have younger children who are not yet vaccinated. They could be living with elderly relatives who are immunocompromised. For people in such circumstances, it may be reasonable to avoid higher-risk indoor activities to protect others in the household.CNN: If you were invited to a Halloween party, what questions would you ask?Wen: I'd ask who is going to be there. If everyone attending is known to be vaccinated, that would be a lot safer than if there are people who are unvaccinated or are of unknown vaccination status.Also, where will the party take place? If it's mainly outdoors, and attendees can choose to remain outdoors the entire time, that will also be much lower risk than if it's taking place entirely indoors.If it's indoors, will it be crowded with people packed together? Or will windows be open and people can space out? That also changes the risk calculus. Of course, you should also take into account your own medical circumstances and those of your family members, as we discussed previously.CNN: Kids ages 5 to 11 may get authorization to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine by Halloween. Should parents try to get them the shot as soon as possible so they can enjoy the holiday?Wen: Many parents will be very eager to get their younger kids vaccinated, but it wouldn't affect their activities over Halloween. Even if kids can get their first shots just before Halloween, they wouldn't be considered fully vaccinated until two weeks after their second inoculation.Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.CNN: And now, the most important question -- what are you and your kids going to dress up as?Wen: My son, Eli, is obsessed with Winnie the Pooh. That's what he was last year, but we never got to go trick-or-treating in the outfit, so he may do that again this time. I think he wants to dress his sister as Piglet. We definitely look forward to getting together with some of Eli's friends' parents to go trick-or-treating in the neighborhood -- and then gathering in our neighborhood park for a playdate.",

        "content": "(CNN)Government records reveal how supply shortages, lapses in care, a lack of transparency and inadequate infection control precautions are fueling the spread of Covid-19 within America's nursing homes.  Troubled facilities and highly rated nursing homes alike have been struggling, with overwhelmed workers trying to identify, isolate and treat patients with the disease on top of their already demanding jobs. Measures aimed at protecting residents from the spread of the disease, meanwhile, have left them even more vulnerable and closed off from the public. As a result, government watchdogs say it is becoming easier for substandard care to go unchecked and for some facilities to keep dangerous secrets. \"There are no tests,\" a nurse at a Michigan facility told a state health department employee at the end of March, according to a government report, recounting how they were expected to take care of a unit full of pneumonia patients known as the \"Covid unit\" and had brought their own medical supplies for residents. \"I have one (resident) who is actively dying right now.\"\n\n\n\nWhat should we investigate next?\n\nEmail Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken\n\n\nAfter announcing its first positive case of coronavirus, town officials in Massachusetts publicly condemned a local nursing home when the fire chief noticed a spike in calls from the facility but couldn't find out what was going on inside the walls.  Read MorePolice reports obtained by CNN through a public records request show how there had been warning signs about trouble brewing within a massive New Jersey long-term care facility \u2014 including multiple calls to police and reports of alleged patient neglect \u2014 for days before police discovered more than a dozen bodies in a makeshift morgue.Medical workers put on masks and personal protective equipment while preparing to transport a body at Andover Subacute and Rehabilitation Center on April 16, 2020 in Andover, New Jersey. (Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty Images)Many of the country's nursing homes were already understaffed and frequently cited for lax infection control before coronavirus began to spread. Now staff are risking their own health and often lacking access to the supplies and testing they need as they care for a population at high risk of dying from the disease.State long-term care ombudsmen, who are tasked with protecting residents, told CNN there are not enough eyes on these facilities at a time when oversight is needed the most.Routine health and safety inspections have been suspended by the federal government to protect against any additional exposure to workers and residents. A CNN review of more than 100 inspection reports documenting visits still taking place, and complaint information gathered from state ombudsmen, provides a snapshot of serious problems during this pandemic \u2014 including unacceptable care and failures to take steps to stem spreading infections. Government employees: What public records should we request as we report on the coronavirus?Families, who are often the ones keeping tabs on their loved ones' care and in some cases even supplementing that care, have been restricted from visiting facilities in an attempt to slow the spread. CNN spoke with family members of nursing home residents in four different states who said they had struggled to get them tested for the virus or receive any updates about their conditions \u2014 and in some cases facility officials had kept vital information from them. One woman said she resorted to calling 911 herself to get her very sick father, who she said tested positive for coronavirus, admitted to the hospital \u2014 where she said he remained as of Thursday in critical condition.On Sunday, the federal government announced a new rule requiring nursing homes to report Covid-19 cases to residents and their families and the CDC. Ombudsmen say it remains to be seen how \u2014 and how aggressively \u2014 this will be enforced by state inspectors. And even when facilities are cited for severe violations, critics have long argued that government penalties are too low to discourage the worst behavior.\"I'm concerned about neglect, poor care, rights being violated and abuse right now,\" said Patricia Hunter, the long-term care ombudsman for Washington state, where the first nursing home outbreak publicly unfolded.Repeated calls  More than a week before the Andover Subacute and Rehab Center II in New Jersey made headlines with the discovery of 17 bodies in the facility's morgue on April 13, there were signs of a deepening crisis, according to police reports obtained by CNN.Repeated calls to police were made. There were calls about patients with symptoms such as a high fever or respiratory distress. One resident was taken to the hospital, reports show; another call was cancelled even though the patient had been in \"full code\" -- meaning they were in need of resuscitation. It's unclear if a third ever made it to the hospital. Police also responded to a fire alarm there, but when they arrived, the report states, they were told it was a false alarm and that maintenance had it under control.  36 are dead from coronavirus at 'overwhelmed' New Jersey nursing homeAnd three days before the bodies were found, reports show county health officials told police they had been fielding complaints about understaffing, a lack of protective equipment and patient neglect \u2014 including allegations that some residents weren't being fed.Even after the police discovered the extent of deaths at the facility (which they said at the time weren't necessarily all linked to Covid-19), frantic calls to police continued. A resident said he wasn't being allowed to call his family, though staff claimed to police it was because it was after hours. Other callers said the facility was in desperate need of more protective gowns and body bags, and a state senator reported there was no staff at the facility. One resident was sent to the hospital with hypothermia when the facility's heat reportedly stopped working, a report shows, though staff later told police the heat was working. As public scrutiny intensified, a nurse reported receiving threats.An ambulance departs Andover Subacute and Rehabilitation Center in Andover, New Jersey. (Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty Images)The state has since said more than 30 of the facility's residents have died of Covid-19 and there have been more than 100 confirmed cases. The facility owner said in a statement that staff had notified state authorities when \"there was a tragic surge in patient deaths,\" with 15 patients dying in a matter of days. He said employees tried to work with funeral homes to transport the deceased residents but were \"left to manage these fatalities as best they could.\" He added that resident safety was paramount at the facility, which had faced challenges related to a lack of protective gear and staffing complications after workers also became ill. In an earlier statement, a facility attorney said that nursing home officials were confident that any future review by the state of what had occurred \"will confirm that the facility has been addressing the unprecedented challenges from this pandemic appropriately.\"Coroners worry Covid-19 test shortages could lead to uncounted deathsNew Jersey has become a Covid-19 hotspot, reporting more than 2,500 confirmed and suspected deaths and more than 13,000 cases in hundreds of state long-term care facilities. Another New Jersey facility with a high number of coronavirus cases is the Lakeland Health Care Center, where Denise Jorgensen's 78-year-old father had been rehabbing a broken hip. She said she and her brother were kept in the dark about her father's fever for days. It was around then a doctor told them he suspected their father had Covid-19 but the facility had run out of tests, according to the family. They said they only learned there had already been deaths in the facility when a mayor wrote a letter to borough residents saying there was a \"major Covid-19 outbreak\" and that eight residents had died of Covid-19.Denise Jorgensen said her father, George P Hanratty, died on March 31 after getting sick at the Lakeland Health Care Center.Jorgensen said she couldn't get through to anyone at the facility until 2 a.m. and was told not to be upset about the letter. She said around eight hours later, she learned that her dad had passed away. A facility official said he could not comment on specific individuals but that the facility has been \"fully transparent in our reporting to state and local officials, accepting of their input and compliant with their recommendations.\"While state data shows there have been 19 Covid-19 deaths at the facility, borough documents tracking coronavirus at the Lakeland nursing home report 21 deaths specifically from the disease but say that 35 residents have died. On the day Jorgensen's father passed away, there is a note in the borough's records saying there were no test kits available. \"I don't know what is going on in these nursing homes, but they are not being truthful with the families,\" she told CNN. \"And since we can't visit or get in touch with anyone they are getting away with it.\"'It feels horrible'An analysis of the limited nursing home inspections that have occurred nationwide since last month shows failures in care may have caused Covid-19 to spread to both staff and employees. The reports detail supply shortages, failures to report Covid-19 infections and exposure to authorities, nurses not adequately monitoring potential symptoms of the disease and staff not properly wearing masks. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the federal agency that regulates nursing homes, instructed state officials in March to stop conducting routine health and safety inspections in order to protect residents. Instead, they have focused on inspecting facilities to check for infection control measures and investigate reports of \"immediate jeopardy\" situations \u2014 which CMS defines as meaning residents are at risk of serious injury or death. In a review of recent inspection reports and enforcement letters obtained from the agency, CNN identified seven nursing homes that had been cited with the most serious violations related to Covid-19. Around 100 facilities had been cited for \"deficiencies\" specifically related to infection control since March 14, according to a separate spreadsheet provided by CMS.Seniors with Covid-19 show unusual symptoms, doctors sayAt the Advantage Living Center in Roseville, Michigan, for example, a federal inspection report from the end of March recounts a litany of missteps. In one case, a nurse working the night shift found a patient who was \"gray, kinda pale\" and rapidly declining, saying that no one had given the resident the fluids they were supposed to have received. \"Their mouth was so dry, they couldn't even talk,\" the nurse said. They then transferred the patient to isolation.When the inspector asked why this resident with Covid-19 symptoms wasn't transferred to the hospital sooner, the assistant director of nursing replied that the staff was overwhelmed. \"I mean, they are taking care of so many people.\" One nurse said the patient's deteriorating condition hadn't been better documented because the facility had been short staffed and very busy and most likely forgot, the inspector wrote.Related coverage:Scientists have bad news about coronavirus antibody testsThe US is halting funding to the WHO. What does it mean?Women leaders are doing a disproportionately great job in the pandemicHow workers are coping with the pandemicSocial distancing may last until 2022 in the USThe resident later died at the hospital. Though they were still awaiting test results, doctors told the family they suspected it to be related to Covid-19, according to the report. The inspection report documenting the patient's care detailed other problems at the facility. Nurses reported bringing in their own medical supplies to treat residents, such as thermometers and blood pressure cuffs because the home didn't have what they needed. The report also found inadequate monitoring of patient conditions, understaffing and failing to properly isolate residents with suspected Covid-19 \u2014 with a delay as long as nine days.\"It feels horrible,\" a nursing assistant reportedly told the inspector when asked about whether staff were able to meet the needs of residents.How coronavirus testing fumbles squandered valuable timeThe Advantage Living Center did not respond to a request for comment from CNN, but provided a plan of correction in the inspection report \u2014 without admitting to the allegations made. It said that medical records showed the resident received fluids at the time they had been ordered and that employees have been retrained on a number of practices such as proper PPE usage. The facility said it had utilized temporary staffing and that facility-provided medical equipment was being used. Employees were also being \"re-educated on Covid-19 as information emerges and trends are identified, including the rapid change in condition and rapid deterioration that can occur for residents with symptoms.\"   'We can't trust them'Born during the 1918 flu pandemic, 101-year-old Jean O'Brien's health had already begun to decline as she struggled with the social isolation of being stuck in her room at the Four Chaplains Nursing Care Center in Westland, Michigan.Family members worried that the virus would be a death sentence if she caught it, but fortunately \u2014 as far as they knew as of early April \u2014 there hadn't been any coronavirus cases in the facility yet.101-year-old Jean O'Brien's family was devastated when they learned she had tested positive for Covid-19 this week.Then her daughter, Megan O'Brien, said her family learned from nurses on April 11 that the nursing home would be opening its doors to Covid-19 patients. O'Brien, her eight siblings and many nieces and nephews rallied together to call employees at the facility and its corporate owner, as well as government officials \u2014 demanding more information about how residents would be kept safe. At that time, her biggest concern was the virus entering \u2014 and then spreading throughout \u2014 the facility. But she soon learned it already had. After appearing on the local news, O'Brien received an alarming message from Trace Fryz, whose mother was also at the facility. Fryz's mother had tested positive for Covid-19 and died from the disease at a hospital weeks earlier. Fryz told O'Brien that it appeared the facility had not been forthcoming about Covid-19 deaths. Covid-19 is listed on Trace Fryz's mother's death certificate.In an interview with CNN, Fryz said she first learned that her mother's facility had multiple coronavirus cases from an ER doctor treating her mother when she was rushed there after falling unconscious at a dialysis appointment.O'Brien said the facility continues to deny it has had any deaths related to the disease. After finally getting her mother tested, with the help of separate hospice employees, O'Brien said the family learned on Tuesday that her mother had tested positive. They had been preparing to pull her from the home and care for her in a local Airbnb, and the family is now trying to figure out how to proceed, saying there have just been \"too many lies from the facility.\" This photo of Fryz's mom with family was taken shortly before she fell ill with coronavirus.\"We can't trust them,\" she said, adding that she is angry at the facility's corporate owners, not its workers who she believes are still trying to take good care of her mother. \"We would have taken her out weeks ago.\"The administrator at Four Chaplains told CNN that all she could say was that the facility was not accepting new Covid-19 patients. She referred all questions to its corporate owner,  NexCare Health Systems, which did not respond to repeated inquiries. The state department of health said it had only just begun to collect data on Covid-19 deaths in nursing homes and suggested contacting the local health department. A Wayne County spokesperson told CNN that the facility currently has four Covid-19 deaths and 32 cases entered in a state database but said he would be unaware of any deaths where a resident hadn't been tested for the disease.  'Ticking time bomb'As the virus has spread across the country, government watchdogs have been logging complaints from families, residents and employees about issues similar to those detailed by federal inspection reports.In addition to the many reports of understaffing, PPE shortages and a lack of transparency, state ombudsman offices told CNN they have received complaints about patients being unfairly evicted and concerns from nursing home employees who have reported being worried they will be punished for speaking out about problems. \"Our program has been inundated with calls,\" said Salli Pung, the Michigan state long-term care ombudsman, adding that she received more than 200 calls related to Covid-19 in March alone. \"We continue to be very concerned about the overall lack of oversight in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.\"'Mind-boggling': How pandemic planning never accounted for a President like TrumpSeveral offices noted concerns that nursing homes were not being forthcoming with information about Covid-19 cases in their facilities.  Advocates for long-term care residents said there is a short-term financial incentive to downplay infections since a publicized outbreak could result in families removing their loved ones and hurt future business. An outbreak could also open the doors for inspectors to cite a facility for numerous other violations such as understaffing. In Virginia, state ombudsman Joani Latimer said one family member recently told her office that a nursing home resident had worsening Covid-19 symptoms but was not being tested or sent to the hospital. So the family member pulled the resident from the facility and drove them there, and a test came back positive. The family is now attempting to provide care at their home, Latimer said.Fryz's mother Loretta posed with a shamrock last month.She said that the unraveling of nursing homes under the stress of a pandemic like this was a \"ticking time bomb,\" given the staffing crisis that already existed in long-term care facilities. \"Until we fully examine and address that problem, we put our residents at risk.\"Hunter, the Washington state ombudsman, has had the opposite problem when it comes to complaints. During more normal times, the office's phone rings around 50 to 80 times a week, with callers reporting dangerous situations within facilities or other problems that warrant further investigation, among other calls. But now, as visits from family and local watchdogs that often lead to complaints have been mostly cut off, her office has only been getting around 25 calls a week. \"I have never witnessed the phone go silent and that is virtually what has happened,\" said Hunter, who has been the state ombudsman for more than eight years. 'Sudden rush of patients'Scott Wodzinksi, the fire chief in the 10,000-person town of Littleton, Massachusetts, began noticing a sharp uptick in calls for service at the Life Care Center of Nashoba Valley at the end of March \u2014 reporting that his department had responded to the facility 18 times in a week. Suspecting coronavirus could be the culprit, he and other town officials who were attempting to respond to the crisis and keep tabs on the situation say they were stonewalled when they tried to get answers from the nursing home. They wanted to know how many of its 100 or so residents were sick with the virus \u2014 information that was vital for the first responders. Nursing homes still struggle to get protective gear and quick testing A public controversy ensued, with the town claiming the facility initially turned down the help of the National Guard \u2014 which had been summoned in early April to conduct testing and ended up being let into the facility a couple days later. The town asked the state health department to intervene. And with the help of lawmakers, they then sent a letter to the corporate owners of the facility, Life Care Centers of America, the same company that owned the nursing home in Kirkland, Washington \u2014 the site of the nation's first outbreak. The Kirkland facility faces a federal fine of more than $600,000 for alleged failures if it does not correct the problems found. The town's letter criticized the company for its \"apparent lack of readiness or responsiveness to the COVID-19 threat\" and stated that in both cases, administrators \"did not provide adequate notification to authorities.\"Tim Killian, a crisis management spokesman hired by Life Care, said the company is confident that both the Nashoba Valley and Kirkland facilities had been in complete compliance with state and federal regulations. He said the company had hoped the federal government would have recognized that what happened in the Kirkland facility was \"a unique situation.\" About the Nashoba facility, he said the company shared the town of Littleton's concerns but had been in touch with local and state health officials as soon as a positive test was received \u2014 adding that Life Care had welcomed the help of the National Guard.

        "content": "(CNN)Angelina Godoy started digging for answers more than a year ago.The human rights researcher had heard that ICE agents occasionally swept up migrant kids and locked them up in juvenile detention facilities, but she had no idea why.One of the places ICE supposedly housed these young people, Godoy learned, was a few hours from her home in Seattle. She searched online for information about the detentions, but couldn't find anything that explained what was going on. She then filed a series of public records requests with officials at the juvenile detention center closest to her, hoping they could shed light on what ICE was doing and why these minors were being held in places run more like jails than the shelters most migrant children end up in when they are detained. She had specifically requested detailed detainee files, with names and personal information redacted, and the facility was ready to share them with her.But what happened next stunned her: ICE blocked the facility from sharing the records and the federal government even went to court to keep the information secret.Unbeknownst to Godoy, she had stumbled upon an obscure pocket of the immigration system, where little is known, and little is divulged.Read MoreWatch Angelina Godoy's interview on Anderson Cooper Full Circle at 5pm ETFor more than a decade, ICE has been taking a small number of immigrant teens it deems to be dangerous far from their families and detaining them for months at a time.For immigration attorneys and human rights experts such as Godoy, the practice is alarming.Angelina Godoy is still seeking documents about ICE's detention of minors.\"I may not object to the fact they are being held,\" said Godoy, director of the Center for Human Rights at the University of Washington. \"But I object to the fact that nobody can even know who they are (and) why.\"Public attention has primarily focused on the treatment of children who recently crossed the border illegally on their own or with their parents. These kids are usually held in Border Patrol camps, family shelters overseen by ICE or on their own in facilities run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) for so-called \"unaccompanied\" children, after arriving without any parents or being separated from them.But teenagers who are already living inside the country with a parent can be classified as accompanied. This means if they are apprehended by ICE, they can be put in secure facilities where ICE has contracted to hold them, mixed among other US youth. Attorneys said most cases they had seen involved undocumented children who had faced a criminal conviction, charge or accusation, but that ICE also has the authority to detain those legally in the country with visas and even green card holders if their criminal records place them in violation of immigration laws.Related: Medical care in immigrant detention centers under fireImmigrant youth -- regardless of their residency status -- are supposed to receive a number of legal protections when detained. Yet more than a dozen immigration attorneys describe the agency's detention of minors as a black hole with little oversight or easy access to lawyers who can help them navigate complicated immigration law.The places these youth are held don't appear on ICE's online map of detention centers. The agency doesn't make its reports about the conditions of the facilities available like it does for others. And family members can't find their loved ones using the federal government's official detainee locator since it only provides information on adults.\n\n\n\nWhat should we investigate next?\n\nEmail Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken\n\n\n\"ICE juvenile jails are secret and unaccountable,\" said Heidi Altman, director of policy at the National Immigrant Justice Center. \"And ICE wants it to stay that way.\"ICE said it follows all rules about when a juvenile can be detained in a secure environment, and described the youth it holds as those with serious criminal histories, saying that \"it would be irresponsible and potentially dangerous for the agency to allow these individuals to remain out of custody with a guardian,\" as they await immigration proceedings or deportation. It did not, however, elaborate on the specific allegations and evidence ICE has used to take them from their families.Philadelphia attorney Mary Chicorelli remembers an immigrant mother who was \"beside herself\" after her son was taken from where they lived in North Carolina to a private juvenile detention center in rural Pennsylvania in 2017.Immigration documents show the 16-year-old was turned over to ICE and sent to the facility after being arrested by local authorities over misdemeanor charges for marijuana and gun possession. Chicorelli recalled the teen looking even younger than he was and said he was free of any previous criminal record. She said he repeatedly asked when he would be able to see his mom again.Attorney Mary Chicorelli\"The separation between the respondent and his mother has increased the stress and anxiety given his mother's health,\" Chicorelli wrote in a motion for his release, saying that the mother, a cancer patient, had brought her son to the United States to escape the violence in Honduras.An immigration judge released him after Chicorelli emphasized in court filings that the teen hadn't been convicted of any of the criminal allegations since the charges were still pending. She stopped representing him after his release and was unable to connect with the family to find out what had happened to him since.Want to read more stories like this? Sign up for our watchdog newsletterAnother North Carolina mother named Leticia, who has gone through immigration proceedings to obtain a visa and only gave permission to use her first name, said that after her 17-year-old son Victor was arrested by police last year, he warned her that ICE agents said they would be picking him up from a Raleigh jail. But she had no idea where they were taking him and no way of finding out.She said as the weeks dragged on, she became increasingly frantic. She depended on Victor, whom she said she brought to the United States from Mexico when he was five. As her oldest son, he cared for her younger children while she worked long hours. He also supported the family financially by picking up odd jobs and working at McDonald's, where the manager described him as \"responsible,\" \"reliable\" and \"eager to learn,\" according to a letter shared by his attorney.Other kids held by ICEICE has justified its longer detention of teens by saying they are a safety risk, but the agency also uses a little-known network of juvenile detention centers and other facilities for a different group of kids as they are being shuttled around the country. The most recent data shows that ICE could hold juveniles at six facilities for shorter stints of less than three days. ICE said in July that these places are used in urgent or unusual situations when kids are unable to immediately be transferred to the facilities where unaccompanied migrant children are typically held (run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement). Immigration attorneys interviewed by CNN hadn't heard of this practice and didn't know whether kids held by ICE in juvenile detention centers for these shorter stays would necessarily need to have criminal histories.ICE said there were no children being housed in these places at the time, though at least two facilities confirmed to CNN they had housed kids this year. One of these facilities, the Northern Virginia Juvenile Detention Center, immediately suspended ICE's placement of children there after being contacted by CNN in mid-July. The executive director said ICE placed three kids at the facility this year, and that some members of the commission overseeing it may have been unaware of this -- voting to officially end the agreement in August.\"I think a better system would have made it so this wasn't a surprise to all involved,\" said Christian Dorsey, Chair of the Arlington County Board, which appoints two members of the commission. He worried whether the kids being brought by ICE were able to get legal help and said ICE's detention of kids in this facility wasn't transparent or consistent with the facility's mission. \"It's not a place to essentially warehouse children who are not necessarily being given access to legal representation.\" But his mother knew Victor had struggled. In a statement he later wrote for his immigration case, Victor, who did not feel comfortable using his full name but agreed to share documentation of his case, said he had a troubled childhood and suffered from depression when his dad left the family. Law enforcement and immigration records show he was convicted of breaking and entering and larceny for a string of car break-ins. He was also convicted of threatening a friend he claimed stole from him. According to a police report, Victor was waiting for the friend when he got off the school bus, took out some sort of knife -- which Victor told his attorney was a pocketknife -- and said \"give me back my s or you're going to regret it.\" No one appeared to be hurt in the incident.It was after receiving a suspended sentence and probation for his latest car break-ins, meaning he was ready to be released by local authorities, that Victor was taken into ICE custody last year. His mom said she worried about whether her son was okay and feared he would be deported back to a country he barely knew. She anxiously tried to find him, she said, asking ICE for information and searching the agency's online locator where family members can track the whereabouts of immigrant detainees. But his name was nowhere to be found.\"I didn't know anything,\" she told CNN in Spanish in an interview in July. The Seattle Times later published a story about ICE's use of Pacific Northwest facilities which included Victor's account. \"I was afraid he might already be in Mexico.\"She said she finally learned of his location when Victor called her from a juvenile detention facility in Oregon and told her not to worry about him. In a statement, the facility said parents are typically notified of their child's arrival within 48 hours, but that it could not speak to whether -- or how soon -- contact is made before a kid arrives at the facility.According to his mother, Victor spent more than three months detained by ICE in Oregon.Statements in Victor's immigration file from detention officers at the Oregon facility described him as respectful and a \"model youth\" -- saying he had integrity and helped to calm down and mentor other \"more troubled youths.\"He was facing deportation, but to prevent that from going on his record, he requested \"voluntary departure\" from the immigration court instead -- and his attorney said he was sent back to Mexico when he turned 18.Government data reviewed by CNN shows that ICE has most recently been authorized to hold minors for longer than 72 hours at three juvenile detention facilities: the Cowlitz County Youth Services Center in Washington state, Abraxas Academy in Pennsylvania, run by private prison operator GEO Group, and the Northern Oregon Regional Correctional Facility's juvenile division (NORCOR).According to data previously released by ICE through a public records request from a group of immigrant advocacy groups, there have been more than 130 bookings of minors by ICE for more than 72 hours between January 2009 and May 2017 -- a small fraction of the overall number of children detained by the government. The data also shows how some minors were held for hundreds of days, and one for more than a year and a half. It did not specify the circumstances of why the youth were being held. ICE told CNN in July that eight male teenagers were currently being detained but did not say how many have been in its custody since 2017.Related: CNN investigation exposes preventable deaths and dangerous care in jails and prisonsA high-profile court settlement from 1997, known as the Flores agreement, dictates how immigrant children should be treated while detained. Among a number of protections, children are supposed to be released to known family members \"without unnecessary delay.\" And more restrictive \"secure\" detention is typically meant to be reserved for those considered to be dangerous to themselves or others.An ICE protocol manual filed in court last year lays out rules for who can be held in secure detention under Flores, stating that this group includes those who the agency determines are \"delinquent\" or \"chargeable as delinquent\" after facing a criminal conviction or accusation. But attorneys who have represented some of these teens say these rules can be left open to interpretation, and that ICE has been able to lock up teens facing a range of charges or accusations the agency views as \"chargeable\" offenses. The lawyers say that fights with classmates or photos on social media that allegedly suggest a gang affiliation have been used as part of the rationale to detain certain teens.CNN reviewed immigration documents from three separate cases. Two involved teens who had faced weapon possession charges, though they hadn't been charged with violent offenses. The third was Victor.Unlike these youths held in juvenile detention facilities, so-called \"unaccompanied\" migrant kids taken into custody, often while crossing the border, are sent to facilities run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement. They receive access to legal services through a network of government-funded attorneys who are given lists of children detained by ORR. These attorneys visit the facilities, brief the children on their rights and help them find legal representation.ICE said juveniles in its facilities should have legal access as well, saying that youth \"are advised of the pro bono attorney lists that are posted within facilities\" and that staffers can help them call lawyers.Related: He applied for a green card. Then the FBI came callingBut without a more structured program in place for kids in ICE custody, attorneys and immigrant rights advocates say that it is far harder to make sure every kid actually obtains representation -- making a lack of legal access one of their biggest concerns about the practice.The same attorneys notified about every kid in ORR detention aren't given a list of those in ICE detention. So even if they wish to help the children for free, they say it's difficult for them to learn who these teens are.The National Immigrant Justice Center's Altman said that as a result, ICE is able to levy serious allegations of gang affiliation and other unlawful conduct -- and children are left \"hard pressed to defend themselves.\"At least two of the three juvenile detention facilities used by ICE have been accused of mistreating kids in the past. Abraxas Academy, in Morgantown, Pennsylvania, has been cited by state regulators for alleged sexual harassment and sexual abuse, as well as excessive use of force to restrain children. In 2015, one staffer who was later fired bit a child, and in 2016 other employees put kids in headlocks, according to the state inspection reports. The facility did not comment directly about the findings in these state inspections, but said its mission is to \"provide safe and humane care\" and that the contract to hold ICE juveniles expired in June, with the last teen released in August.The NORCOR juvenile detention center, meanwhile, was the subject of a 2017 report from Disability Rights Oregon, a nonprofit that under federal law has the authority to investigate certain facilities in the state. The report highlighted \"inhumane conditions\" at NORCOR -- saying \"conditions were harsher and more restrictive than any adult jail we had visited.\" Related: 19 years old, in jail and begging to go to the hospitalNORCOR said it disputed many of the findings in the report but acknowledged that a review of policies and practices was necessary. After changes were made, NORCOR said an independent review found the facility was \"safe, open and hospitable.\" It also said it encourages families to remain connected to the youth held there, making visitation available five days a week and allowing teens two free phone calls each week.The third location used by ICE for juveniles, the Cowlitz County Youth Services Center, said ICE would need to comment about the reasons teens are sent there. It also said that kids with attorneys are allowed to have contact with them and that employees notify parents of their child's whereabouts as soon as they receive contact information from ICE.*Godoy, the human rights researcher set on finding out more about this practice in the Pacific Northwest, said one of the aspects that disturbs her most is that even if a court has adjudicated a case and determined a teen can be released to the public, ICE is able to step in and detain them longer.She said this opens the door for potential abuses of power -- especially given the lack of transparency surrounding ICE's justification for locking these teens up instead of allowing them to go through immigration court while home with their families.Godoy is now involved in time-consuming, complicated litigation as the federal government has fought to keep the documents she wants from being released.The agency is arguing that the county cannot release them without violating a federal regulation preventing state or local governments from making these kinds of detainee records public. But Godoy still questions this reasoning and why the agency is so set on keeping her from the information.\"The level of aggressiveness with which they are pursuing secrecy should alarm us,\" she said.What should we investigate next?

        "content": "(CNN)Some of the country's largest hotel companies continued to house immigrant detainees even after they publicly condemned the federal government's use of their rooms for this purpose, an attorney who receives government detention data told CNN.At least seven companies issued statements in July opposing the detention of immigrants in their hotels following protests from customers and activists.\"We do not believe hotels should be used in this way and will decline any requests to do so,\" Choice Hotels, for example, said in its statement at the time.Nonetheless, the government continued to place detainees in Choice hotels and in locations belonging to at least two other national hotel groups that had policies opposing the practice, according to data from immigration attorney Carlos Holgu\u00edn, who receives monthly Department of Homeland Security reports on the placements of detained kids.Holgu\u00edn receives this information as one of the attorneys tasked with monitoring the government's adherence to the Flores agreement, a high-profile court settlement which dictates how immigrant children should be treated while detained. Two additional sources, who were familiar with the cases but requested anonymity, confirmed the details about these hotel stays to CNN as well.Read MoreAt least 17 migrant youths were temporarily held by the federal government in hotels in August and September, according to ICE data provided to Holgu\u00edn. The specific locations of all of the hotels were not available, and he did not have knowledge of whether additional youth were held recently or how many adults may also have been placed at hotels.Related: Medical care in immigrant detention centers under fireFederal data previously released to advocacy organizations through a public records request showed that ICE has used hotels in the past as well. Those used between 2015 and 2018 included a couple locations that held hundreds of immigrants -- and one that held thousands.Without confirming CNN's inquiries about the recent use of hotels, ICE said that it \"has long utilized hotels to temporarily house illegal aliens while pending release or transfer to another facility,\" and that \"the typical stay is an overnight or two.\"The agency said hotels may be used in \"emergent instances\" to hold detained immigrants, including migrant children who are on their own and on the way to licensed facilities or for family units.\n\n\n\nWhat should we investigate next?\n\nEmail Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken\n\n\n\"Hotels are used to temporarily house vulnerable populations,\" the agency said in a statement. \"Using hotels for short term detention of family units allows ICE to keep families together.\"It did not provide information about what kind of security measures are typically taken when detained immigrants are placed in hotels.Choice Hotels said that without the specific locations of the recent stays, it could not confirm or deny what sources told CNN -- that five immigrant youths were held in its hotels in August and September.Three were held at a Comfort Suites in August, the sources said, while one stayed at Sleep Inn & Suites in August, and another stayed there in September. Before these stays, in July, Choice had said publicly that it was not aware of any of its hotels, which are independently owned and operated, \"being asked to serve as detention facilities.\" The company told CNN it communicated its position to franchisees earlier this year and that each property manages its own reservations and contracts.'Secret and unaccountable': Where some immigrant teens are being taken by ICE\"We are working to take additional proactive measures to ensure Choice branded hotels are not being used as detention centers by examining the language in our brand Rules and Regulations and considering changes to establish greater clarity moving forward,\" Choice said.The Best Western Plus Dragon Gate Inn in Los Angeles' Chinatown also reportedly held immigrant youth -- with two children staying there in August, and two in September. When CNN called and asked to speak with the manager of this location, an employee said \"we don't discuss that,\" and hung up. ICE's public data shows that Dragon Gate Inn has been used to house immigrant detainees in the past as well, dating back more than a decade.The Best Western chain stated in July that it was unaware of any of its locations being used as detention centers. \"We believe that hotels should be used for their intended purpose which is to provide accommodation for the traveling public,\" it said at the time.When asked by CNN about the recent stays, the company said in a statement that the Dragon Gate Inn no longer \"offers or provides accommodations\" to ICE. It wouldn't say when the change was made or whether corporate had been aware of these stays.Want to read more stories like this? Sign up for our watchdog newsletterWhile Red Roof Inn was not among the chains that came out publicly against the hotel detentions in July, the company told CNN it also had a policy at the time that its locations should not be used in this way.\"Red Roof hotels are not set-up or intended to be used as detention facilities,\" the company said. \"We reject the idea that hotels are to be used for this purpose.\"Yet according to the sources, at least eight minors were held at a Red Roof Inn in August and September. Red Roof said it was not aware that any property was being used for this purpose and couldn't look into the stays CNN inquired about without a specific location. It added that it has told its franchisees that \"if there is a request for their hotel to be used as a detention facility, we strongly advise them to deny the request.\"Marianne Jennings, professor emeritus of legal and ethical studies in business at Arizona State University, said hotel companies made these pledges even though they didn't necessarily have the power to ensure that all of their independently-run locations would actually put an end to the practice.\"They then have the charge of hypocrisy added to the emotional immigration issues,\" she said.CREDO Action, an advocacy group which lobbied hotels this summer to stop the government from using their businesses to house immigrants, told CNN that the companies still doing this should \"denounce these franchisees and their unconscionable actions, and demand that they take steps to stop all franchisees from collaborating with ICE.\"Allowing immigrants to be detained at their properties, it said, helps ICE to \"supercharge deportations.\"Refusing to collaborate, they added, might \"help weaken ICE's ability to carry out mass raids, especially those targeting families since many detention centers don't allow children.\"Related: 2 doctors were held by ICE. They say what they saw at one facility shocked themGinger Jacobs, a California immigration attorney, said the issue is more nuanced than this, however.While she opposes the detention of immigrants in general, she said that it is currently a reality and hotels can be a more humane option than detention facilities. It all depends on why the immigrants are being held there and how they are treated. At least in the San Diego area, she said she previously observed hotels used for humanitarian purposes in urgent situations -- for a pregnant woman or a mom and young child who were awaiting transfer to a nonprofit shelter, for example.The public statements made by these hotels may have been well-intentioned, she said, but simply cutting off access without understanding the specific circumstances in which they are being used could have unintended consequences.What should we investigate next?

To his family and colleagues at a US nonprofit, 43-year-old Zamarai Ahmadi was an aid worker applying for a US visa to get his family out of Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.  In the two weeks since US drone operatives fired a Hellfire missile at a car in a residential Kabul compound, two vastly different narratives have emerged about the man who his family say died alongside nine relatives. JUST WATCHEDCNN investigates deadly US drone strike in AfghanistanReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCNN investigates deadly US drone strike in Afghanistan 08:16The Pentagon maintains at least one ISIS-K facilitator was killed in what Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Mark Milley called a \"righteous strike\" on the compound on August 29.In a statement, US Central Command pointed to \"significant secondary explosions\" as evidence of a \"substantial amount of explosive material\" in the vehicle. A US official with knowledge of the operation told CNN Thursday that operatives tracked the car for about eight hours before initiating the strike. Read MoreBut CNN interviews with two explosive experts and more than two dozen of Ahmadi's relatives, colleagues and neighbors raise questions about whether an ISIS-K facilitator was killed in the attack and whether the car contained explosives.  Their accounts also prompt doubts over whether the military had sufficient intelligence to launch a strike that, according to family, would ultimately kill three men with visa pathways to the US and seven children aged 15 and under.The lead-upIn the days leading up to the strike, tensions in the Afghan capital were high. An ISIS-K suicide attacker had detonated his vest outside a gate at Hamid Karzai International Airport three days before, killing at least 170 people and 13 US service members. And an August 31 deadline was fast approaching for the US and its allies to complete their evacuation of increasingly desperate people from the airport.JUST WATCHEDVideo shows aftermath of blast outside Kabul's airportReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHVideo shows aftermath of blast outside Kabul's airport 01:22After the attack, US President Joe Biden was firm: \"We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay.\"We will respond with force and precision at our time, at a place we choose and at a moment of our choosing.\" On August 28, Biden said US commanders had warned another terrorist attack on the airport was \"highly likely\" in the next 24 to 36 hours. \"I directed them to take every possible measure to prioritize force protection,\" he said in a statement. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay.\"Joe BidenUS President\n\n\nThe US official told CNN that intelligence sources led the US military to a compound about 5 kilometers (3 miles) northwest of Kabul's airport, where they believed the August 26 airport attack had either been planned or directed. As the compound was within a few hundred meters of an old ISIS safehouse, the location didn't surprise them, the official added. The US began monitoring the house and sent an unmanned aircraft overhead, the official said.August 29, about 8.30 a.m.That morning, Ahmadi's day started in a similar way to many others, according to his workmates. He often acted as their driver, they said, using a Toyota Corolla owned by the US nonprofit Nutrition and Education International (NEI), where Ahmadi had worked for 15 years.At 8.44 a.m., Ahmadi received a call from NEI's country director asking him to pick up a laptop from the colleague's house, according to the colleague and phone records of the call. But first, Ahmadi drove to pick up a former colleague, who asked to be called Khan for this story for security reasons. Khan wanted to go to the office to get information about US visa applications. Zamarai Ahmadi was a \"humble, compassionate, humanitarian employee,\" according to the nonprofit he worked for. Some parts of the photo have been blurred for security reasons. Khan said Ahmadi arrived at his house at about 8.45 a.m., and phone records confirmed he phoned as he pulled up outside. Ahmadi and Khan then picked up the laptop from the country director's house. Ahmadi got out of the car to get the laptop from his colleague's father, Khan said. Ahmadi arrived at the house just before 9 a.m., according to Khan. At about the same time, the unmanned aircraft overhead detected a vehicle pulling out of a suspected ISIS safehouse, the US official told CNN. There wasn't much coming and going from the house, so when a vehicle did leave, \"it was significant,\" the official said. The US began following that vehicle. The country director said his house -- where he lives with his parents, three sisters, wife and three children -- has never been an ISIS safehouse. His family has lived at the residential address for more than 40 years, he said. In a statement, NEI said the implication Ahmadi was sympathetic to a terrorist group was \"incredulous\" and said the accusation that NEI was indirectly or directly co-operating with the group threatened the lives of its employees. Just after 9 a.m. Ahmadi and Khan collected another colleague from his home, according to Khan, who corroborated the timing with phone records. The trio stopped at a roadside stall to buy a takeaway breakfast of chips and naan before driving to the office, according to Khan.August 29, 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.As US drone operators monitored the car from above, the US military was picking up chatter from suspected ISIS militants plotting more suicide attacks, the US official told CNN. Intelligence indicated the cell would pick up materials and meet up with someone on a motorcycle, the US official said, without specifying the time and locations for those events. Over the next eight hours, the US observed the vehicle stop and unload objects, and appear to meet up with someone on a motorcycle. \"So it seems to correlate or did correlate with what the intelligence was suggesting was going to happen,\" the official said. \n\n\n\nSecurity footage shows Ahmadi and two men arriving at Nutrition and Education International's office. Ahmadi carries what appears to be a laptop case. According to CNN's calculation, the time is 9.36 a.m. on August 29. Credit: Provided by Nutrition and Education International\nAhmadi's workmates, however, described a relatively typical day for them. The mood in the car was jovial, said Khan, his former workmate.\"(Ahmadi) was the same, like the past -- just joking, talking with each other, laughing,\" he said. Recently, NEI -- a nonprofit dedicated to addressing malnutrition in Afghanistan -- had been delivering rice and soybeans to camps in Kabul full of people who had fled the Taliban as militants claimed more regional territory. At about 9.30 a.m., Ahmadi and his two passengers arrived at the NEI office where they ate their takeaway breakfast, according to Khan and the country director. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"(Ahmadi) was the same, like the past -- just joking, talking with each other, laughing.\"KhanAhmadi's former workmate\n\n\nAfter breakfast, Ahmadi and three other men -- including Khan -- headed to a Taliban security station in a nearby district to request permission for the food distribution program. It was one of two security stations they visited that day, according to NEI's founder Steven Kwon and two of the people in the car.Two of the people in the car said they also visited a bank in the center of the city before the car returned to the office at about 2 p.m.Khan said he did not remember stopping to talk to a motorbike rider during their travels that day. CCTV footage shows the security guard at the office wheeling a motorbike. Both Khan and another passenger said they did not see anything suspicious.About 4 p.m. By late afternoon, the US military observed something else that alarmed them: people loading what they believed to be explosives into the back of the vehicle.The people were seen \"delicately\" handling objects that appeared to be \"somewhat heavy\" and loading them into the car, the US official said. Those objects were assessed to be some sort of explosive material due to the way they were being handled, the official said, without detailing what the objects looked like.  For the past few weeks, Ahmadi had no running water at his house, so he filled plastic containers with water at work and took them home to his family, according to colleagues. A NEI watchman who asked not to be named said that at about 3 p.m., Ahmadi asked him to help fill the containers with a hose as he didn't have water at home.\n\n\n\nAhmadi and another man are seen pulling out a hose and carrying containers. According to CNN's calculation, the time is 2.34 p.m. on August 29.  Credit: Provided by Nutrition and Education International\nClosed-circuit television footage from the NEI office obtained by CNN shows Ahmadi filling up plastic containers with a hose that afternoon. The timestamp on the video said it was 12.48 a.m. on August 28, but it was light outside, indicating the timestamp was wrong. A CNN journalist visited the office and confirmed the timestamp was nearly 38 hours behind, suggesting the men filled up the plastic containers at about 2.30 p.m on Sunday.The men then put the water canisters into the boot of the car, the NEI watchman said.At about 4 p.m., Ahmadi gave two of his workmates a lift home, following the same route in reverse to drop them off before heading to his family's compound, according to Khan, the former workmate.It would be Ahmadi's final drive home.  About 5 p.m. Excited children ran out to meet Ahmadi as he pulled up in the courtyard of the home he shared with his three brothers and their wives and children, relatives and neighbors said. Ahmadi often let his 9-year-old son Farzad park the car, and other children often clambered into the vehicle, family said. But as the children raced toward him, a Hellfire missile carrying a 15 to 20-pound warhead hit its target. It took less than one minute from the moment it was fired to explode, according to the New York Times. CNN asked the US official for comment on the timing of the missile, but the official declined to comment. The car was swallowed in flames, according to witness accounts and video from the scene. In total, 10 people were killed, including seven children -- four of whom were in the car at the time of the strike, according to family. The US disputes these numbers. Ahmadi's future son-in-law Naser Haidari, a former US army security guard who until recently served with Afghan forces, was killed as he washed himself in the courtyard ahead of evening prayers, the family said. Ahmadi's 19-year-old son Zamir, who his friends described as a fashion lover, was also killed. \"There was screaming from everyone, not just myself,\" said Samia, Ahmadi's daughter who was due to marry Haidari in the coming days. \"At first I thought this is an attack on the whole of Afghanistan and everywhere must be taken by terrorists. I did not know that the attack was only on our house.\"Ahmadi's brother Romal lost all three of his children in the strike. Romal's wife Arezo Ahmadi said shattered glass fell on her face immediately after the explosion, and she ran outside, screaming for her daughters.\"There was blood everywhere,\" she said. \"We run to everyone, seeing if we could save them.\"\"I saw the bodies, they were all burned,\" said neighbor Karim Ahmadi, no relation to Zamarai Ahmadi. \"The car had been entirely destroyed. Pieces of flesh had flown everywhere.\"According to the US official, those who took the shot observed the driver and one adult male when they fired. No children could be seen in the car -- and it was only after the missile was fired that children were spotted on the drone video feed approaching the car, according to the US official. Immediately after the strike, a US Central Command spokesman said initial indications suggested there were no civilian casualties.Later that day, the spokesman said Central Command was aware of reports of civilian casualties, although it suggested those could have been caused by \"subsequent explosions.\"\"We're investigating this. I'm not going to get ahead of it. But if we have verifiable information that we did in fact take innocent life here, then we will be transparent about that, too. Nobody wants to see that happen,\" Pentagon spokesman John F. Kirby said on August 31.US nonprofit worker Zamarai Ahmadi, third from left, was applying for a visa to the US for himself, his wife Anisa, and their children Zamir, Zamira, Faisal and Farzad.Three days after the strike, the US Defense Department acknowledged for the first time that others had been killed in the strike. Milley said the US had very good intelligence, and had gone through the \"same level of rigor that we've done for years.\" \"At least one of those people that were killed was an ISIS facilitator,\" Milley said at a press conference on September 1. \"So were there others killed? Yes, there are others killed. Who they are, we don't know. We'll try to sort through all of that.\" Speaking to Congress Monday during a House Foreign Affairs committee hearing, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the strike was being looked at \"very carefully\" by others in the administration.\"No country on earth, no government, takes more precautions to try to ensure that anyone other than the terrorist target is struck using a drone or by any other means,\" he said. \"But certainly we know that in the past, civilians have been hurt and have been killed in these strikes.\"The aftermathCNN visited Ahmadi's house within hours of the attack and found the charred skeleton of his car sitting twisted in the courtyard. Broken glass and rubble lay around the concrete yard. The windows of a nearby maroon SUV were smashed and the trunk was blackened. But the rough clay walls around the courtyard were still standing. In the aftermath of the strike, the US pointed to \"significant secondary explosions\" as key evidence the car contained explosives. Two officials who saw US surveillance imagery in the aftermath of the strike confirmed to CNN that there were large secondary explosions. \"It was loaded up and ready to go,\" an official said shortly after the strike. But the US official told CNN on Thursday there had been one \"secondary explosion\" -- rather than multiple explosions other US officials described immediately after the strike -- and said initial investigations confirmed there were at least three suspected civilian casualties. Relatives and neighbors inspect the remains of the US Hellfire missile strike in the residential compound in Kabul.Two experts who reviewed extensive footage filmed on the scene by CNN say the scene is consistent with the aftermath of a Hellfire strike, but both say there is no evidence of one \"significant secondary explosion\" -- let alone multiple blasts. They point to the limited damage to a car parked nearby and to the surrounding walls of the courtyard, which remain largely intact. One of those experts, Brian Castner, a former explosive ordnance disposal officer for the US military in Iraq who now works as a war crimes investigator for Amnesty International, said the site showed evidence of an initial blast followed by a car fire. He did not see any evidence of a significant secondary blast. \"If there really was a 'significant secondary explosion,' that wall should be knocked over, the tree should be gone from the middle, the SUV should be flipped on its side,\" he said of the car parked nearby. He said the damage could be consistent with the detonation of a single, five-pound suicide vest -- something that would not be considered a significant secondary explosion -- but determining that conclusively would require a forensic investigation of the site. In a press conference Monday, Kirby said he was not aware of any option that would put investigators on the ground in Kabul to complete their assessment. The cause of the secondary explosion is still under review, said the US official, who claimed the secondary blast was four to five times larger than the initial explosion. While the official conceded the vehicle wasn't \"packed to the gills with explosive material,\" he said the explosion was consistent with a couple of 15-pound suicide vests, a large number of 3 to 5-pound suicide vests or loose explosive material that had been put into the back of the vehicle. The US official acknowledged the secondary blast could also have been caused by a gas cylinder.   But an international explosives engineer, who asked not to be named for professional reasons and who viewed CNN video of the scene, said there was no evidence whatsoever of a secondary explosion four or five times larger than the initial explosion. For that, the car would have needed to contain significantly more explosive material, and the blast would have damaged the nearby car, vegetation and wall, he said. \"On the evidence that has been presented, the United States government is grasping at straws,\" the engineer said. Demands for justiceThe US official pointed to a final piece of evidence that they had successfully killed an ISIS-K facilitator: immediately after the drone strike, the terrorist chatter stopped. However, in comments to CNN Saturday, an ISIS-K source denied any of the victims were connected to the terror group. ISIS-K also claimed responsibility for a failed attack on the airport the next day, when at least five rockets were shot down by the airport's missile defense system. A burnt-out car that had been modified with multiple tubes appeared to confirm a vehicle was used as an improvised missile launch pad. CNN analysis shows that car was also a Toyota Corolla -- a common car in Kabul, and the same make as the car Ahmadi drove. ISIS claimed responsibility for a foiled rocket attack on Kabul's international airport.Kabul is now run by the Taliban, enemies of terrorist organization ISIS-K. A Taliban spokesperson told CNN Friday they did not believe Ahmadi's family was associated with ISIS-K and were not investigating the incident. Shoaib Haider, a judge who is also Ahmadi's second cousin, wants the strike to be investigated as a potential US war crime. \"We hope the United Nations and human rights supporters will carry out an assessment of such incidents, so that tragic incidents like this one, in which innocent children and members of a family were eliminated (do not happen) in the future,\" he said. Emal Ahmadi, one of Ahmadi's brothers, and the father of Malika, a 2-year-old who died in the attack, called the US \"traitors.\" Emal previously worked for a US company and had been in the process of applying for a visa to the US, he said.  \"(The US) should investigate and then target,\" he said. \"How did you know from the sky what is here? There were children in and around the car and you targeted them. Isn't it a crime?\"The law around drone strikes is complicated, and full transparency is not always possible, said Gloria Gaggioli, the director of the Geneva Academy on International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights. \"It does not mean that a complete lack of accountability is acceptable,\" she said. William Boothby, an international humanitarian law expert who wrote a book on the law of targeting, said states are required to do all that was feasible to verify the status of their target as lawful. But failing to take proper precautions isn't a war crime under the Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court -- and regardless, the US isn't a party to the statute, Boothby said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"There were children in and around the car and you targeted them. Isn't it a crime?\"Emal Ahmadi Victim's father\n\n\nBut while the strike might not be illegal, it raises moral questions. The US has previously shown a \"level of negligence\" in distinguishing civilians from targets, and was often slow to admit to civilian casualties or pay compensation, Castner said. With the US pulling out of Afghanistan, strikes with less intelligence could happen more often, he cautioned.\"In some ways it's more of the same, and in some ways, it's going to be even more so lack of oversight, challenges with intelligence, and more of these cases where they may or may not have hit the right thing,\" Castner said. It's been two weeks since the attack, and Ahmadi's family is still struggling to comprehend the loss of loved ones. Some also lost a potential pathway out of Afghanistan; the family had made multiple applications for US visas between them, including applications in the names of Zamarai Ahmadi and Naser Haidari. The family now fears any perceived link to ISIS-K could expose them to danger from the Taliban. NEI worries the US has made their colleagues even greater targets, and wants the US to help evacuate and resettle them. Samia, who lost her fiance, father, and three of her brothers in the blast, feels she has no one left in Afghanistan. \"(My fiance) always said to me that he would get us out of here. Now, the US should get us out of here,\" she said.Written and produced by Julia HollingsworthReporting by Sandi Sidhu, Julia Hollingsworth and Anna Coren in Hong Kong; Abdul Basir Bina in Istanbul, Turkey; Ahmet Mengli in Kabul, Afghanistan Edited by Hilary WhitemanGraphics by Henrik Pettersson and Natalie LeungVideo editing by Zane Hosgood",

        "content": "Bhopal, India (CNN)The white van arrived in slum areas of Bhopal, a city in central India, blasting a message over the speaker system that seemed too good to refuse: \"Come and take the coronavirus vaccine and get 750 rupees ($10).\" Locals who recalled hearing it back in December said they scrambled to take up the offer -- 750 rupees was about twice what they'd usually earn for a day's hard labor. And many had struggled to work at all during the pandemic.   \"They told us it is the corona vaccine and we should get it so that we don't fall sick,\" said Yashoda Bai Yadav, a housewife from Bhopal who participated in the trial alongside her husband. They say they later discovered from local activists that some of them hadn't been given an approved vaccine and had unwittingly taken part in a clinical trial for India's homegrown vaccine, Covaxin. Only half of the participants in Covaxin's Phase 3 trial received a vaccine -- the other half received a placebo, a normal part of clinical trials. One participant -- Radha Aherwar -- even found out it was possible she got a placebo while speaking to CNN for this story, saying \"Oh, so what I got wasn't a vaccine? I didn't know that there was a possibility you could get a water shot.\" The experience of some participants in Bhopal suggests the medical team from People's Hospital, who was running the trial, may not have adequately explained that they were part of a trial and that only some of them would receive a vaccine -- both alleged lapses, if proven true, appear to violate India's clinical trial rules that require informed consent from all participants. This raises questions about the quality of data in the trial, and experts such as Amar Jesani, the editor of the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics, worry that this could lead to vaccine hesitancy among some groups in India, which has reported more Covid-19 cases than any other country except the United States.   Read MoreThe Covaxin Phase 3 study, sponsored by the vaccine's developers, Indian biotech company Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), involves almost 26,000 people at 26 locations, including more than 1,700 in Bhopal, the site of one of the world's worst industrial disasters.      The Shankar Nagar slum -- where many of the participants live -- is just 3.7km (2.3 miles) from the abandoned Union Carbide factory which was at the center of the 1984 disaster that exposed more than half a million people to a toxic gas cloud. Nearly 4,000 people died in the immediate aftermath, and the disaster was blamed for at least 10,000 subsequent deaths, and more than 100,000 permanent injuries.  Decades later, many residents still suffer related health issues, raising questions from local non-governmental organizations about residents' suitability to take part in a study that vaccine developer Bharat Biotech has called the biggest Phase 3 vaccine trial ever conducted in India.Phase 3 trials are traditionally the final step of human trials before a vaccine is authorized to roll out en masse. However, Covaxin was approved by the Drugs Controller General of India for restricted emergency use in January, before preliminary results from the trial were released. Its Phase 3 trial isn't expected to be completed until next year. The government has procured 5.5 million doses of Covaxin and 11 million doses of Covishield -- the local name for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine -- for the first phase of what it is calling the largest immunization drive in the world.  At least two bioethics experts, one public health expert and four local non-governmental organizations, have raised ethical questions about the trial site in Bhopal, run by People's Hospital, which is associated with the People's College of Medical Sciences and Research Centre. In addition, those concerns were also raised in a joint statement released on January 14 by more than 40 organizations and 180 individuals, including public health activists and bioethicists.\n\n\n\nMore than a dozen Bhopal trial participants told CNN they did not know they were taking part in a clinical trial. Another four knew they were part of a trial, but say they did not understand what that meant.   Bharat Biotech, ICMR and People's Hospital have all denied wrongdoing. They say that the trial complied with study protocol, guidelines and regulatory provisions, and that they are focused on generating high quality data and would not do anything that compromises patient safety. They say that participants gave informed consent and denied that the money offered acted as an incentive. India's drug regulator, the country's health ministry, and the ethical committee overseeing the trial in Bhopal have not commented on the allegations.      The push for Covaxin is tied up in national rhetoric, as India -- already the global leader in vaccine production -- aims to complete an ambitious rollout at home, and engage in vaccine diplomacy by exporting Indian-made shots. On January 16, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said: \"The world's confidence in India's scientists and our vaccine expertise is going to be further strengthened after the Made in India corona vaccines.\"    But Jesani, Dr. Anant Bhan, a Bhopal-based bioethics expert, and Amulya Nidhi, a public health expert and the co-convener of the People's Health Movement India, all say that the alleged recruitment process, if proven true, would be a violation of Indian protocols governing how vaccine trials should be conducted. That could undermine the quality of the trial data, and potentially global trust in India's prized coronavirus vaccine.   'We thought it was the vaccine'   Shankar Nagar slum in Bhopal is made up of tiny, colorful houses with roofs created from tin sheets and discarded tarps.   Typically, many locals work as day laborers, waving down vans on the main road each morning to go to construction sites where they spend hours lifting stones and bricks. Since the pandemic, there hasn't been enough work to go around, forcing many to rely on government-provided rations. Some women wander the slum, carrying sticks to sell as firewood. Others have turned to alcohol or chewing tobacco to pass the time. So when the white van that locals recalled arrived in Bhopal slum areas near People's Hospital offering the vaccine, 18 people saw it as a quick way to make money, they told CNN.   \"My life will go anyway someday,\" Hira Bai, a mother of three, said sardonically. \"I went because of the greed of 750 rupees, anyway we are used to dying ... my life has no value.\"   Locals say they believed the van was from People's Hospital, a private institute less than 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) away from Shankar Nagar which would often send vans to the area to conduct checkups as part of the hospital's community outreach program. Some said they immediately piled into the vehicle, which seated more than a dozen passengers.  \"The van came and everyone around me was going so I also went,\" said Kesri Chillaar, 59, a laborer who lives with his wife and three children in nearby Gareeb Nagar slum.   \"We thought it was the vaccine, so we went,\" said Yadav, the housewife, who lives in Oriya Basti, another slum close to Shankar Nagar. \"We didn't know it was a trial.\"   Chotu Das Beragi, a 27-year-old laborer, said he heard the loudspeaker announce that if he didn't take the vaccine now, he may have to pay money for it later. \"I thought, 'There is no work anyway these days' ... so I thought, 'Let me get the vaccine, I will get 750 rupees as well,'\" he said. \"I thought, 'This will be a good way to get the day's earnings.'\"   Once at the hospital, a large white building with columns and reflective blue windows, 12 participants told CNN they were asked to sign forms, although two people only signed the forms when they received their second shot. Another one gave audio-visual consent and another was asked for a thumb print instead of a signature. However, of those 14 participants, eight said that they were unable to read -- the state of Madhya Pradesh, where Bhopal is located, has one of the lowest literacy rates in India at around 70%, according to the country's most recent Census in 2011. Only participants over 60 said they were offered audio-visual consent forms. The four who could read said they weren't given the opportunity or time to go through the 10-page form written in Hindi. The form, which CNN has obtained, includes jargon such as \"immuno response,\" \"placebo\" and \"immunogenicity\" -- terms that would be confusing to anyone without medical training.  \n\n\n\nAlthough six people CNN spoke to said they were aware they were in a trial, four said they did not understand what a trial involved, or concepts such as a placebo. \"I did not understand what it was a trial of,\" said Beragi, the day laborer. Only two of the 21 participants CNN spoke to knew they were in a trial and had full understanding of what that entailed. At least eight Bhopal slum residents told CNN they were not asked about underlying health conditions, even though \"uncontrolled\" comorbidities is listed as a reason for excluding participants in the trial's own protocol. Rajesh Panti, 45, a survivor of the Bhopal gas tragedy, said when he received the first dose, he was not asked whether he was taking any medicine. Chillaar said he takes medication for diabetes every morning, but was not asked at the hospital whether he had any underlying health issues. Sarita Jathav, 26, said she is pregnant, but was only told that pregnant women couldn't take the vaccine when she went to take her second dose, which she did not receive.     All 21 of the participants CNN spoke to said they were given forms to record any adverse effects of the shot. However, none had written anything on it, despite eight of the 21 participants describing side effects, including aches, vomiting, stomach issues, pains, and feeling weak. It is unclear whether the people who described side effects received the vaccine or the placebo. They said they didn't know why recording their symptoms was important. At least 13 of the 21 participants told CNN they were illiterate, meaning they were unable to use the form anyway. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRadha Bai (top), Jetender Veria (left) and Man Singh Parihar (right) pictured in Shankar Nagar, a slum in Bhopal, India, on February 7, 2021. All say they did not realize they were participants in Phase 3 Covaxin trials. (Credit: Ajay Bedi/CNN)\n\n\nAnil Kumar Dixit, the dean of People's College of Medical Sciences and Research Centre in Bhopal, said he was not aware of any van and did not send one to the slums. He said it was clarified to participants that they were part of a trial, and that only 50% would receive the vaccine while the other half would be given a placebo. He said the hospital did pay participants 750 rupees, per the ICMR and Bharat Biotech's instructions, but it was to cover them for any lost wages -- not as an incentive to take part in the trial.  Under ICMR's 2017 Ethical Guidelines, subjects may be paid for their inconvenience and reimbursed for expenses incurred, although not to such an extent that it induces them to take part. Dixit said his hospital did not ask participants if they were Bhopal gas victims, although administrators did examine them for underlying health conditions and rejected them if they had a chronic health problem. Bhan, the Bhopal-based bioethics expert, said he was surprised the hospital hadn't considered that some participants might be victims of the Bhopal gas tragedy.    Around 10% of all Bhopal participants reported minor adverse effects, while around 1 to 2% were treated in hospital, according to Dixit. He said his hospital was only registering adverse events that required treatment, and that most of the minor events had been resolved over the phone. Dixit said that for those who couldn't read, the form was explained in either Hindi or English, depending on what they preferred, before they signed.    \n\n\n\nStaff from People's Hospital which is administering the trial told participants they would check up on them via phone, according to Dixit and the participants, but two participants CNN spoke to said they hadn't received a call, and two said they didn't know if they had. Another participant said they had received calls in the first week, but not in the second week when their adverse effects started.  Two others said they had received calls but that their phone belonged to a family member, making communication harder.    Four people CNN spoke to said they needed to go to a hospital for treatment, and of those two said they were asked to pay for treatment for what they considered adverse effects, including neck pains and vomiting, despite the 10-page document that they signed stating that they would be covered, something that is also required by India's Good Clinical Practice guidelines.       Chillaar, for instance, said that when hospital administrators called to check on him following the shot, he told them that he was having neck problems. They told him to come in for treatment, but when he did, he said he was told to pay more than 3,000 rupees ($41). Dixit, dean of People's College of Medical Sciences and Research Centre, said there were only \"one or two cases\" where miscommunication led to participants being charged.  Chillaar says he got the first shot on December 10 and the second on January 7 -- Covaxin requires two shots administered four weeks apart. When he spoke to CNN on January 28, he said that he was still not able to work. \"I am the primary earner and it has come to the point where we are going hungry,\" he said. \"I am not even able to go earn and I have spent 3,000 to 4,000 rupees on treatment.\" CNN has no evidence that the shot caused his health issues and it is unclear whether he received the placebo or vaccine as the trial is blinded.   What the rules say  Hundreds of people who live in the Shankar Nagar slum still live with health effects from the Bhopal gas tragedy, according to Rachna Dhingra, the leader of Bhopal Group for Information and Action (BGIA), which works with communities impacted by groundwater contamination from the leak.   In late December, Dhingra says she began hearing reports of people living in the slum being given the coronavirus vaccine. That set off alarm bells: she knew India hadn't yet formally rolled out a coronavirus vaccine.   Dhingra began investigating and found that many of those people had actually been part of a clinical vaccine trial -- and many said they did not realize it.   Dhingra and BGIA spoke to 233 participants, and estimate that 800 residents from more than five slum communities impacted by the 1984 tragedy in Bhopal had been part of the Phase 3 clinical trial. Nasreen, a field worker from BGIA who uses only one name, said that in many cases entire households of five or six people had taken part in the trial. Dhingra says in all of the cases there were issues around how consent had been obtained. \"It spread like wildfire because people thought they were not only getting vaccinated, but also that they were getting money,\" Dhingra said. \"They could never do this kind of announcement in middle-class neighborhoods because everyone would know that this is not possible.\"   Activist Rachna Dhingra talks to a resident of Oriya Basti slum in Bhopal on January 8, 2021.India's New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules 2019 require \"freely given, informed, written consent\" from each study subject, including that they understand the risks and responsibilities involved in receiving an unapproved drug. Information must be provided verbally and in a patient information sheet in \"language that is nontechnical and understandable by the study subject.\"  In the case of Covaxin, the vaccine had only been tested on approximately 755 people across both Phase 1 and 2 trials before it was administered in Phase 3 clinical trials -- and those Phase 1 results, which were released in the Lancet in January, were not out when many of the participants received their first dose. That study found that the vaccine can produce antibodies to coronavirus and no serious adverse events related to the vaccine were reported.  ICMR's head scientist of the division of epidemiology and communicable diseases, Dr. Samiran Panda, said the seriousness of the pandemic justified using the accelerated approval process without cutting any corners when it came to safety.    Dhingra also says around 25% of the participants the NGO spoke to reported experiencing adverse effects -- more than twice the number that Dixit said had suffered minor adverse effects. In trials across the world, it is common for participants to report some adverse effects during a trial. Nasreen is a field worker with Bhopal Group for Information and Action (BGIA) that works with communities affected by the Bhopal gas leak. One Bhopal trial participant who died nine days after receiving the injection has drawn widespread media attention in India, prompting outlets to publish stories raising questions over the trial.   CNN has no evidence that 45-year-old Deepak Marawi's death was linked to the vaccine trial, but because of the lack of transparency around his death -- the post-mortem still hasn't been made public -- his widow, Vaijayanti Marawi, and others following the trial say the case raises concern and requires further examination. Bharat Biotech could not confirm if Marawi received the vaccine or placebo as the study is blinded, but they said his death \"had been thoroughly investigated\" and found not to be connected to the trial. The company says Marawi died from cardiorespiratory failure as a result of suspected poisoning.Dixit said staff had followed up with Marawi for seven days, as he said they do with all participants, to ask about any problems. Marawi had said no every day, Dixit said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVaijayanti Marawi and two of her sons in Bhopal, India, on February 7, 2021. Marawi's husband Deepak Marawi died in December after participating in the Phase 3 clinical trials.\n\n\n Arun Shrivastav, the head of the pharmacology department at the Gandhi Medical College in Bhopal, which headed the investigation into Marawi's death, said that his committee's investigation found that the trial protocols had been adequately followed. When asked generally about the alleged use of vans in recruitment, he said that if a van loudspeaker was used to advertise the vaccine for 750 rupees, then it would be \"unethical, totally wrong.\"  \"If there is anything like this happening then it cannot be counted in the trial and the trial would be barred,\" he said.      'Violation of good clinical practices'  Bioethics and public health experts Bhan, Jesani and Nidhi all said Bhopal residents should have been considered vulnerable, and extra care should have been taken to ensure they knew what they were agreeing to.    The standard for getting consent is even higher for vulnerable communities -- including people who are impoverished or illiterate. According to India's 2019 New Drugs and Clinical Trials rules, if a trial participant is unable to read or write, an impartial witness should be present throughout the entire informed consent process to help sign the consent form. An audio-video recording of the informed consent process is required in cases using \"vulnerable subjects,\" which includes \"impoverished persons\" and patients with incurable diseases. \"You are dealing with people who are highly vulnerable, who are not even fully educated, do you expect them to come and say, 'These are my rights'?\" said Jesani, the editor of the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics. \"You have to inform them about their rights.\"   As for the offer of 750 rupees, Bhan, the Bhopal-based bioethics expert, said it was not necessarily an ethical violation for money to be offered -- the issue is whether it was used as an incentive. \n\n\n\n But statements made by participants suggest that even though the amount offered was relatively low, it was enough to motivate some trial participants in Bhopal. Madhya Pradesh, where Bhopal is located, has some of the lowest wages for casual workers in India, according to a 2018 India Wage Report by the International Labour Organization. \"I thought it was some patriotic thing and, I won't lie, we were getting money also,\" said Bhopal resident Panti.    If the allegations about misleading participants, failing to get informed consent and failing to follow up on adverse events are true, the problem goes beyond ethics -- it reflects on the quality of the trial data, according to experts.   Bhan said that if adverse events were missed, that meant crucial data points had been left out of the Phase 3 trials.   \"If that is what has happened, it's obviously a violation of good clinical practices. It's also a violation of guidelines around how ethical conduct of research should happen,\" he said, speaking about the allegations.\n\n\n\nThe current guidelines for clinical tests in India are relatively new. After Delhi liberalized its clinical trial policy in 2005, international companies rushed to test their drugs in India, where it was cheaper and easier to find participants. Some of the tests were reportedly carried out in Bhopal, on residents who allegedly weren't aware they were involved in trials. The 2019 New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules are a result of various orders from the Supreme Court following a case filed in 2012 by non-profit Swasthya Adhikar Manch, which Nidhi is also a co-convener of.Bhan, Jesani and Nidhi believe the new Bhopal allegations, if true, suggest that more work needs to be done to improve oversight over clinical trials. Jesani says, if the allegations are founded, it means the data from Bhopal should be excluded as the trial on that site wouldn't have been done in a scientific way.   What can be doneOn January 10, Dhingra and three other Bhopal-based NGOs wrote a letter to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, asking them to stop the Bhopal trial. They wrote that the involvement of the Indian Council of Medical Research in a trial with \"glaring and grave violations\" of the guidelines ICMR laid down was \"alarming and deeply troubling\" and said the situation must be addressed to avoid the public losing faith in vaccines.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA timeline of Covaxin\n\n\n\n\nOct.23, 2020\n\nBharat Biotech receives Drugs Controller General of India approval to conduct Phase 3 clinical trials with 26,000 participants for Covaxin.\n\n\n\n\nNov.16, 2020\n\nCovaxin's Phase 3 clinical trials begins.\n\n\n\n\nDec.22, 2020\n\nBharat Biotech announces it has recruited 13,000 participants \u2014 around half its target.\n\n\n\n\nJan.1, 2021\n\nCentral government's subject expert committee, which recommends vaccines for emergency approval, says that Bharat Biotech should try to expedite recruitment for Phase 3 Covaxin trials as \"efficacy is yet to be demonstrated.\"\n\n\n\n\nJan.2, 2021\n\nThe subject expert committee recommends India's drug regulator approve Covaxin for restricted emergency use, citing \"updated data ... in the wake of the incidence of new mutated corona virus infection.\"\n\n\n\n\nJan.3, 2021\n\n India's drug regulator gives restricted emergency use authorization to Covaxin and Covishield, the name given to the Oxford-AstraZeneca developed vaccine in India.\n\n\n\n\nJan.7, 2021\n\nBharat Biotech announces that it has finished recruitment and all 26,000 participants have received their first dose.\n\n\n\n\nJan.10, 2021\n\nFour Bhopal-based NGOs write to India's prime minister and health minister, warning them of alleged ethical violations in the Bhopal Phase 3 Covaxin trials.\n\n\n\n\nJan.16, 2021\n\nIndia begins the first phase of its vaccination drive \u2014 rolling out Covaxin and Covishield to 10 million healthcare workers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: CNN reporting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n They copied the letter to the Drugs Controller General of India, which has the power to investigate alleged breaches.    More than a month later, the groups say they have received no response.    Despite multiple requests for comment, Bharat Biotech has not responded to CNN's emailed questions. In a public statement in January, the company said participation was voluntary and every participant gave fully informed consent, even those who were not able to read or write. All participants were paid 750 rupees, but it was not an inducement, the company said, rather a payment to cover transport and expenses, adding that they are following practices set by the Indian Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Participants are only enrolled after a careful assessment of their \"various health parameters,\" the company said.   \"The development of Covaxin is a matter of great pride to us, not just at Bharat Biotech but also for India, and indeed the rest of the world,\" the company said. \"We would not do anything that would compromise either the scientific rigor of what we do or the lives of patients.\" \"Our constant focus during the development of the vaccine and the clinical trials has been on ensuring patient safety and ensuring that the study is done to the requirements of all the relevant and applicable rules and guidelines, and that the data generated is of the highest quality and valid.\"                     Three other trial sites told CNN they had collected data on all minor adverse events, including headaches or fever. Four trial sites told CNN they had difficulty reaching the target of 1,000 trial participants. By contrast, the People's Hospital site in Bhopal managed to register cases quickly. \"Other centers were not able to achieve the target so then (Bharat Biotech) asked us to do more numbers,\" Dixit said.   ICMR's head scientist of the division of epidemiology and communicable diseases, Panda, said excluding the Bhopal gas victims from the study would have been discriminatory, denying them an \"opportunity.\"   \n\n\n\n\n\n\"You are dealing with people who are highly vulnerable, who are not even fully educated, do you expect them to come and say, 'These are my rights'?\" Amar Jesani \n\n\n\nPanda said the ICMR spoke to the principal investigator running the Bhopal trial following the ethical violation allegations in the media, but were assured by the investigator and his medical team that they had followed protocol. They did not independently speak to any of the participants in the trial, although they kept the Drugs Controller informed of their Bhopal communications, Panda said.  According to Panda, there have been no allegations of wrongdoing at any other site. CNN has contacted 12 other sites but has found no evidence that the alleged issues that happened in Bhopal took place at other sites.    According to Dr. Mohammad Shameem, the principal investigator of a Phase 3 Covaxin trial site in Uttar Pradesh, Bhopal's alleged recruitment strategy of offering vaccines for 750 rupees using a van with a loudspeaker would have needed sign-off from the local ethical committee. It's not clear if the People's Hospital's institutional ethics committee knew that a van was allegedly being used for promotional purposes. CNN has attempted to contact the committee for comment.    Push to roll out  The controversy over the Covaxin trials is taking place as India rolls out its ambitious plan to immunize 300 million of its 1.3 billion population by August.  But some healthcare workers in India, who were first in line to receive a shot, have expressed reticence to take the vaccine until there is more data on Covaxin.Experts worry the ethical questions over Bhopal could undermine trust in the vaccine when it's rolled out more broadly -- both in India and abroad. Bharat Biotech has signed an agreement to supply Brazil with the vaccine, and is applying to conduct trials in Bangladesh, Reuters reported. Bharat Biotech also signed an agreement with biopharmaceutical company Ocugen to develop its vaccine for the US market.  A priest performs prayer rituals on a carton containing the first consignment of Bharat Biotech's Covaxin vaccine. India has traditionally been receptive to vaccines, and there isn't a strong anti-vaccination movement in the country, but Jesani, from the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics, says that could change if the government doesn't act to restore confidence in Covaxin. Bhan, the bioethics expert, said an audit of the Bhopal trial would build confidence in the process. If these initial questions linger and manifest as general anti-vaccination sentiment, that could be a problem for the public's willingness not only to get the Covaxin vaccine, but also other coronavirus vaccines as India continues to report more than 10,000 cases each day.   Jesani said that is why it is so crucial that authorities investigate claims that some Bhopal participants didn't know they were part of a trial.   \"We don't want people to lose faith. We don't want people to lose trust in the vaccination,\" he said. \"If they lose trust in the Covid vaccine, they will lose trust in other vaccines.\" Esha Mitra reported from New Delhi and Bhopal, India.

        "content": "Morrinsville, New Zealand (CNN)It's Friday night in the small town of Morrinsville and a handful of locals are waiting at the Golden Kiwi on the main street for a greasy parcel of fish and chips. It wasn't so long ago that Jacinda Ardern was behind the counter, taking orders at the nautical-themed takeaway joint. Now, the 40-year-old New Zealand Prime Minister is one of the world's most recognizable leaders.Throughout her three-year term, she's attracted headlines -- for being an unusually young Prime Minister, for giving birth while leading a country, for her empathetic handling of the Christchurch mosque attacks, and lately, for her swift, effective action against the coronavirus pandemic.That's given her an outsized profile for the leader of a country of 5 million people. She's graced the covers of Vogue and Time magazine and hosted American TV personality Stephen Colbert at her suburban Auckland home. Last year, she topped a survey of most trustworthy politicians -- in Australia. And, as she heads into this year's New Zealand's election on October 17, polls put her as one of the country's most popular leaders ever. The big question isn't whether she will win a second term for her party, which now seems all but certain, but if her party will make New Zealand history by becoming the first to secure a majority under the current political system.Read MoreBut Ardern is not without her detractors. Her critics say she has done little in her first term to deliver the transformational government she promised three years ago. And some of her opponents are here in Morrinsville, where she grew up. JUST WATCHEDA look at Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's profileReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHA look at Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's profile 02:41A prophetic yearbook in MorrinsvilleMorrinsville is better known for producing milk than Prime Ministers. Driving into town, lush green paddocks dotted with dairy cows slowly give way to one-story weatherboard houses behind short wooden fences, which in turn become farming supply stores and tractor outlets. On the main street, colorful cow sculptures grace the sidewalk -- a cow outside a pharmacy has a medicine bottle painted on its side, while another outside the veterans' association has a gun attached to its back. A shiny Holstein Friesian -- or \"Morrinsville Mega Cow\" as it's known -- looms over the main stretch, as tall as a two-story building.Many of the town's 8,000 locals are dairy farmers, contributing to one of the country's biggest export industries. Historically, farmers tend to vote for the pro-business National Party -- and Morrinsville is no exception. It was in this National Party stronghold that Ardern -- who has gone on to become a darling of progressives around the world -- had her formative years. Born in 1980 to Mormon parents, Ardern spent the first years of her life in Murupara, a small, economically depressed forestry town in New Zealand's Bay of Plenty. Ardern -- who declined to be interviewed for this story -- said in her maiden speech to parliament that her passion for social justice was sparked by what she saw in Murupara. Unemployment was widespread and some turned to suicide. The girl who babysat her and her sister \"turned yellow from hepatitis,\" a virus more common in developing countries.   In the 1980s, Ardern's family moved 160 kilometers (100 miles) away to Morrinsville, where her grandfathers had dug drains and farmed. Ardern's father worked as the town's police officer and her mother as a cook at the local school. As a 14-year-old, Ardern landed after-school shifts at the Golden Kiwi fish and chip shop. \"She was always a very good talker,\" said Morrinsville farmer John Walsh, as he waited one chilly Friday night for takeaways outside the shop, where he used to be served by the young Ardern.It was her aptitude for speaking that scored Ardern her first political victory as a schoolgirl in the 1990s. The Golden Kiwi, a takeaway joint in Morrinsville that Ardern worked at when she was a teenager.Ardern when she was at Morrinsville College.Ardern was the student representative for the board of trustees at Morrinsville College, a small high school with colorful murals and a large grassy field dedicated to rugby, New Zealand's national sport. In that role, she managed to convince the board to change the uniform rules so that girls could wear shorts -- \"ghastly corduroy trousers,\" as Ardern's former social studies teacher Gregor Fountain remembers them -- not just skirts. \"My recollection is that we were ahead of our times,\" said John Inger, who became principal of Morrinsville College while Ardern was at school, and who is still the principal more than two decades later. \"No doubt in a very conservative rural community like ours that would have raised a few eyebrows.\"Inger remembers the teenage Ardern as intelligent, articulate, cheerful, and persuasive, with a strong sense of social justice. She was a keen debater, a frequent speech competition winner, and a member of the school's Amnesty International group, which advocated for human rights. When pushed on whether there was anything she was bad at, Inger reluctantly points to her lack of sporting ability -- but even then, she gave it a go, he says.Unlike many of her peers, she didn't drink, Inger says. She was well respected and \"walked around with a big smile on her face all the time,\" he says. \"She had no enemies that I'm aware of.\" Fountain agrees: \"At school, she was popular but not like the total cool kid. There were cooler, trendier people.\"When Ardern left high school, she graduated with the second-highest grades in her year. The real tell for what was to come was in her high school yearbook, where classmates voted on each others' likely futures.In the Morrinsville College 1998 yearbook, there's a prophetic phrase written in Comic Sans: \"Most likely to become Prime Minister ... Jacinda Ardern.\"Political lossesMorrinsville isn't where national leaders are made. For that, Ardern needed to go to New Zealand's capital.Home to less than 300,000 people, the windy city of Wellington sees itself as not only the country's political hub, but also its arts and culture capital. It's a liberal place where almost every cafe has a vegan option, and where public servants include their preferred pronouns on their email signatures. Wellington was a far cry from Morrinsville, where it was unusual for teenagers to be interested in politics at all -- never mind being a center-left Labour Party supporter, according to Fountain. \"In Morrinsville, it was totally countercultural,\" he said, of Ardern's decision to join the Labour Party at 18. It was in Wellington that Ardern, after graduating from Waikato University with a degree in communication studies, began working in the office of Labour leader Helen Clark, the country's first-elected female Prime Minister.  Ardern began questioning the Mormon church's stance on LGBT people, she later told local media. At the time, Ardern was living in a flat with three gay friends, and increasingly felt that her beliefs contradicted with her religion. \"I could never reconcile what I saw as discrimination in a religion that was otherwise very focused on tolerance and kindness,\" she told the New Zealand Herald in 2017. Next, Ardern went to London -- a well-trodden move for university-educated New Zealanders in their 20s -- where she worked for the United Kingdom's Government Cabinet Office. Fountain, who became Ardern's friend after she left school, remembers meeting up with her while he was over there for a school trip. She took him to a spot where former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill watched films during World War II. \"It was this lovely moment of student-turned-teacher,\" he says. At 28, Ardern was ready to move into the political spotlight. She returned from the gray stone buildings of London to stand as a Labour candidate in the farming region of Waikato, which included Morrinsville. But there was no hometown advantage. Waikato is so blue -- the color of the National Party -- that it hasn't elected a Labour Party representative in nearly 100 years. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Ardern didn't win. But thanks to New Zealand's electoral system, which allocates 49 of its 120 seats based on the proportion of party vote, she got into parliament anyway, becoming the youngest sitting member.  The following election, in 2011, she stood in Auckland Central against the National Party's Nikki Kaye in a face-off that was chauvinistically termed the \"battle of the babes.\" Both were young, ambitious women who appealed to youth voters. But Ardern lost by 700 votes -- or two percentage points. Once again, she got into parliament anyway.Although she wasn't the elected lawmaker for Auckland Central, she became a well-known figure in the city. And not just for politics -- outside of Parliament, she dabbled in DJ-ing, including at a major summer festival on Auckland's waterfront alongside alternative music favorites.

A post shared by  Jacinda Ardern (@jacindaardern) on Jan 28, 2014 at 11:25pm PST\nIn 2014, she lost to Kaye again -- this time by 600 votes. Finally, in February 2017, she won a safe Labour seat -- a seat once held by former Prime Minister Clark -- in a byelection triggered by the resignation of Clark's successor. It was only the start. An unprecedented electionTwo months before the September 2017 national election, New Zealand's Labour Party was in the doldrums. A slew of middle-aged male leaders -- four in less than a decade -- had failed to ignite enthusiasm in voters, and the party was heading toward its fourth crushing election defeat in a row. Then, in a surprise move, then-Labour Party leader Andrew Little stood down after polls made it clear there was no way he could win. After years of telling media that she didn't want to be Prime Minister, Ardern was appointed in his place. The whole thing happened so quickly that her partner Clarke Gayford, a music television host turned fishing show presenter, who had been out on the water in Australia, found out about her new role well after everyone else. \"Have been underwater filming all day off Sunshine Coast, I miss anything?\" he quipped in a tweet. At 37, she was Labour's youngest-ever leader and in line to lead the country, if the party could hustle enough votes. Have been underwater filming all day off Sunshine Coast, I miss anything? pic.twitter.com/GRONJ1uGZf\u2014 Clarke Gayford (@NZClarke) August 1, 2017\n\nWeeks before the election, excitement grew among left-leaning voters who felt re-energized by Ardern's upbeat, fresh approach. Papers covered Ardern in glowing terms and, within three weeks of taking over, Labour's polling had soared by 15 percentage points. Local media coined a new term: \"Jacindamania.\"  And when the election was held in September 2017, her party took home 37% of the vote -- well up on the 25% it had received the election before, but still less than National's 44%. As neither major party had the 50% of votes needed to lead the country, both had to pair with minor parties. For a month, there was no victor. Then Winston Peters, the charismatic -- and often contrarian -- leader of the conservative New Zealand First Party, announced he would partner with Labour and the liberal Green Party. Ardern found out alongside everyone else: She was going to be Prime Minister.A year ago today @winstonpeters made a bold call that changed EVERYTHING. We watched on TV like everyone else, except I pointed a camera the other way. Here's a before and after thats never been seen.What an incredible year it has been, what a year ahead. Welcome to the ride. pic.twitter.com/ytjwajSzmn\u2014 Clarke Gayford (@NZClarke) October 19, 2018\n\nShe was New Zealand's youngest leader in more than 150 years, and one of the youngest heads of state anywhere in the world. Fountain remembers hearing the news and says his first thought was concern over how Ardern would wrangle her coalition partners and hold the government together. That night, as he put his kids to bed, he heard his former student on the radio.\"I was like, oh my god, she is the Prime Minister,\" he said. \"She just sounded like the Prime Minister.\" The first babyOn January 19, 2018 -- less than two months after she was sworn in as Prime Minister -- Ardern posted on Instagram. That in itself wasn't unusual -- she had harnessed social media throughout her political campaign. But this particular image reverberated around the world.\"Clarke and I are really excited that in June our team will expand from two to three, and that we'll be joining the many parents out there who wear two hats,\" she captioned the photo of two large and one small fish hook -- a nod to her partner's passion for fishing.In the lead up to the 2017 election, Ardern had been asked on one of New Zealand's biggest television channels about whether she planned to have a child. She told the broadcaster that it was fine to ask her that question as she had opened herself up to it, but she made it clear that other prospective employees shouldn't be put on the spot.          View this post on Instagram           And we thought 2017 was a big year! Clarke and I are really excited that in June our team will expand from two to three, and that we'll be joining the many parents out there who wear two hats. I'll be Prime Minister AND a mum, and Clarke will be \"first man of fishing\" and stay at home dad. I think it's fair to say that this will be a wee one that a village will raise, but we couldn't be more excited. I know there will be lots of questions, and we'll answer all of them (I can assure you we have a plan all ready to go!) But for now, bring on 2018. A post shared by  Jacinda Ardern (@jacindaardern) on Jan 18, 2018 at 1:44pm PST\nAfter Ardern revealed she was expecting a baby, her critics -- at least in New Zealand -- were silent. By and large, it quickly became an accepted reality in New Zealand that their leader was having a baby.In part, that was thanks to the way she worked to normalize her pregnancy. Other women held down jobs while pregnant and balanced motherhood with their work -- so why couldn't she? \"I've always maintained that I'm pregnant not incapacitated,\" she told state-owned broadcaster 1 News. \"The one disclaimer I would give is that it does remove your ability to put your shoes on.\" In June, media kept wait outside one of Auckland's main hospitals. It was more like a royal birth than a political event. No other New Zealand leader had ever given birth in office. In fact, Ardern was only the second in the world to do so.On June 21, 2018 -- still less than a year into her first term -- Ardern gave birth to Neve Te Aroha Ardern. Her first name, Neve, means \"bright\" or \"snow\" -- a nod to being born in the Southern Hemisphere winter. Her middle name -- which means \"love\" in New Zealand's Indigenous language, M\u0101ori -- is named for Mount Te Aroha that looms above Morrinsville's lush farmland.A few months later, Ardern made history again. She became the first leader to bring her baby to the United Nations General Assembly. \"I wish I could have captured the startled look on a Japanese delegation inside UN yesterday who walked into a meeting room in the middle of a nappy change,\" Gayford said as he tweeted a photo of their daughter's UN security pass featuring a rather unusual title: \"New Zealand first baby.\"  Christchurch, White Island, coronavirus: A term of disastersThe first year of Ardern's leadership was a breeze compared with what was to come. On March 15, 2019, a White supremacist killed 51 people in the first terrorist attack on New Zealand soil. As New Zealand -- a country where gun murders are infrequent -- reeled from the attack, Ardern responded in a way that once again catapulted her into international headlines.

She called the gunman a terrorist and said she would deny him the notoriety he wanted by never mentioning his name. And, in striking images that went around the world, she wore a hijab as she mourned alongside the Muslim community.\"She certainly excels in times of crisis,\" said New Zealand political commentator Ben Thomas. \"What was really needed was the expression of empathy ... her enormous wells of empathy are very genuine and she can project them probably more effectively than anyone on the world stage.\" Later that year, she faced another crisis. An active volcanic island frequented by tourists erupted, killing 21. Once again, Ardern was quickly on the ground in Whakat\u0101ne, hugging first responders who had tried to rescue the people on White Island. Then this year, like all other world leaders, Ardern has faced the coronavirus outbreak, the world's worst pandemic since the Spanish flu more than 100 years ago. And while other leaders faltered, Ardern won international recognition for shutting borders early and imposing a strict nationwide lockdown, even when the country had very few cases. That's meant that New Zealand has reported 25 coronavirus deaths, even as other parts of the world battle fresh waves of infections.     Under New Zealand's lockdown, Ardern appeared alongside the country's top health official in daily briefings broadcast on national television where she reiterated the importance of listening to medical experts. She had already been popular -- but during the coronavirus pandemic, with the whole country on lockdown, Ardern's daily televised updates became a ritual for many.\"She's seen variously as every voter's sister or best friend or mother or girlfriend,\" Thomas said. That only added to her regular-woman appeal. Despite her international star power, Ardern continues to present herself as no different from anyone else. While in Auckland, she lives in a modest house with a back deck that was built by Gayford. On Instagram, sandwiched between numerous political posts, she shared a Neve artistic masterpiece, a homemade rabbit-shaped birthday cake, and a makeshift desk at her parents' house that no one would have guessed was a world leader's office. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's never been any suggestion that there's a secret, calculating Jacinda.\"Ben Thomas\n\n\n\"There's no public and private Jacinda, there's just Jacinda,\" says Fountain. \"And she's always been like that. I just feel like it's genuine authenticity.\"\"It's very much New Zealand, you could be anywhere and anybody -- a neighbor -- could decide to stand for Parliament,\" said Ethel Riddle one afternoon in May, as she sat with her high-spirited Morrinsville knitting club. When Ardern had baby Neve, the Knitter Knatters made her a white waffle-knit blanket with the Morrinsville Mega Cow in the middle. \"It's not a very major difference between them and us.\" Just because her image might be cultivated doesn't make it inauthentic, said Thomas. \"There's never been any suggestion that there's a secret, calculating Jacinda,\" he said.But Ardern's personal popularity and exceptional response to the country's crises can only take her so far. And beyond those, some say Ardern's first term has been less successful.Why some people won't vote for herIn a muddy paddock surrounded by mooing cows, lifelong Morrinsville farmer Lloyd Downing describes Ardern as \"charismatic,\" \"intelligent,\" and approachable.\" He knows her family -- he even went to her grandfather's funeral. \"I guess we'd have to be proud of her,\" he said.But Downing -- like many others in Morrinsville -- won't be voting for her. \"She's a pretty special person, and she's very popular overseas,\" Downing says. \"Her and her party we could probably wrap up (in a package) and send over there.\"Lloyd Downing at his farm in Morrinsville, New Zealand.Unlike in other countries, where politics has become increasingly polarized, Ardern's opponents have plenty of positive feedback. They admire how she has handled the three crises during her term --  the Christchurch massacre, the White Island volcano eruption, and the coronavirus pandemic. And they like her as a person. \"I look at the way she handles my mother, who is definitely not a Labour voter, and my mother thinks she walks on water,\" says Alison Dawson, the mother of Ardern's high school friend, Virginia Dawson. But beyond that, some say her policies pose unnecessary economic risks.Downing thinks Ardern and her party have attacked the rural community, creating strict environmental controls to clean up New Zealand's polluted waterways that make life harder for farmers. He also worries that Labour has no business expertise: \"She's throwing money around like drunken sailors, there's money going everywhere.\" Like other countries around the world, New Zealand has taken on more public debt this year to cope with the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. New Zealand's debt is forecast to rise from 19% of GDP in 2019 to 43% this financial year -- and as high as 55% of GDP in 2024. Labour says the debt is needed to cushion the economic downturn, but National has questioned how Labour plans to repay it.  Her detractors -- some of whom have labeled her \"Taxcinda\" due to what they see as her party's apparent proclivity for taxing -- argue that her party doesn't have the economic chops to handle the country's pessimistic post-Covid outlook. \"She's a very good Prime Minister, but I think the spending is just too much, it's going to send the country broke,\" said Morrinsville tennis coach Clem Apted.The other key criticism of Ardern is that, beyond her successful handling of crises, she hasn't achieved her promise of leading a government of \"transformation.\" In reality, says Thomas, her government has been defined by incremental changes -- and has actually failed in key areas.      One example is the government's flagship promise to build 100,000 high quality, affordable homes in 10 years -- to address homelessness and dampen the overheated property market that had priced out first home buyers. In September 2019, Ardern's government announced it would abandon the target, and by July 2020, the government said it had sold just 613 KiwiBuild homes, around 2% of its original goal. \"(Ardern's skill) matters during Covid, when you're trying to get people to buy into this idea of solidarity and caring for each other,\" said Thomas. \"In terms of getting 100,000 houses built, it doesn't really matter whether you deliver 400 houses with kindness or with diffidence -- you've still totally failed to deliver.\"Ardern's legacyIn some ways, Ardern faced an uphill battle to bring in significant policy shifts. As coalition leader, she needed the support of not just Labour's more natural ally, the Green Party, but also the more conservative New Zealand First Party for any changes in the law -- and that was not always forthcoming. After years of campaigning on a capital gains tax aimed at dampening the overheated housing market, Ardern announced last year that Labour would rule out introducing it under her leadership. At least part of the reason for the reversal appeared to be her coalition partner, Peters. \"I could not get the support of New Zealand First,\" Ardern told state broadcaster Radio New Zealand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a small town warmth that she has really carried with her.\"Gregor Fountain\n\n\nThomas said it was hard to say how much Peters had constrained Ardern during her first term. \"There's certainly a mix in there of New Zealand First providing a real handbrake on some things and also being a convenient excuse on others.\"This election, polls show Ardern's Labour Party is on track to increase its share of the vote -- and could even obtain more than 50%. If that happens, it would be unprecedented. Since New Zealand's current political system was introduced in 1996, no party has ever won more than half of the votes -- they have always formed coalition governments with other parties. Ardern herself has played down the possibility of a record-breaking victory -- and has refused to rule out partnering with Peters in any future coalitions, despite the apparent difficulty he has caused her government. If Ardern wins a majority, she's in a position to push through more transformational policies. For now, her legacy is likely to be limited to the deft handling of multiple crises, said political commentator Thomas.Ardern's former teacher Fountain sees it differently. To him, Ardern's style of leadership -- her emphasis on kindness and wellbeing -- has already had an impact on New Zealand's society. \"There's a small town warmth that she has really carried with her.\"The question now is whether she can parlay her popularity into transforming New Zealand in other ways.

        "content": "(CNN)In the fall of 1988, a 13-year-old was raped and murdered in her bed. The crime would have been shocking anywhere else, but in Hwaseong, then a rural area near South Korea's capital Seoul, murders like this were happening with disturbing regularity. She was the eighth female to be murdered there in two years. Nearly a year after the teen was killed, police arrived at the house of a 22-year-old repairman, just as he was about to eat dinner. \"What's this about?\" Yoon, whose full name is not being published due to a South Korean law that protects the privacy of suspects and criminals, remembers asking. \"It won't take long,\" he says police replied. The officers took him to a small interrogation room with a single table at the local police station where they questioned him for three days about the 13-year-old's rape and murder. Eventually, they extracted a confession.Read MoreYoon told police that on the night of the murder, he had gone for a walk to get some air, according to records of his confession obtained from his attorney. During the walk, he had to stop several times to rest -- his childhood polio had left him with a limp so bad that he had been exempted from compulsory military service. Around midnight, Yoon saw a house with a light on and felt a sudden \"urge for rape,\" he told police, according to transcripts of his confession. He climbed into the house and attacked the young girl, although he told police he knew the parents were asleep next door.Afterward, he burned his clothes and went home, according to the confessions. Little is known about the girl and her family, who have never spoken to media. Yoon's story is somewhat clearer: He was convicted of raping and murdering the 13-year-old girl and sentenced to life in prison, though his sentence was later reduced on appeal. He was released after 20 years in prison.The problem is, Yoon says he didn't do it. Where everyone knows everyoneBefore 1986, Hwaseong wasn't the sort of place where violent crime happened. About 226,000 people lived in the area, scattered among a number of villages between forested hills and rice paddies. One of those villages was Taean-eup, where Yoon lived. In the 1980s, Taean-eup was a bustling community with rice-wine bars and Korean-style coffee shops where locals liked to gather and gossip. Many people worked in the nearby factories, many of which created electrical goods, such as light bulbs, remembers Hong Seong-jae, who ran the farming machine repair store where Yoon worked. Others worked as rice farmers, and even those who lived downtown kept cows for milk. Everyone in Taean-eup knew each other, Hong said. Before the murders, there was no real crime to speak of -- only the odd robbery or break-in.\"But we were all so poor, there wasn't much to be lost,\" Hong said.But in 1986 that changed. In September that year, a woman was murdered, the first in a series of killings that came to be known as the Hwaseong murders. By 1991, 10 women and girls had been killed in the Hwaseong region, including the 13-year-old killed in her bed. In all of the cases, the victims had been sexually assaulted, and in many of the cases, an article of their clothing, such as stockings or a blouse, had been used in the killing. The victims included housewives, schoolgirls, and a department store worker, according to Ha Seung-gyun, who was involved in the investigation. The youngest were teenagers, the oldest were 71 years old, according to police records.       No one seemed safe. As the murders kept happening, the people of Hwaseong grew more afraid.Residents formed squads and patrolled the streets at night, armed with sticks. Women avoided going out after dark.\"There were no street lights and it was very dark,\" said 55-year-old Park, who worked at a factory in Jinan-ri, another village in Hwaseong, in the 1980s. CNN agreed not to use her full name due to the sensitivity of the case. \"I would take the bus and when I encountered a man, I'd be frightened. I was told not to wear red clothes and not to go out after dark.\" There were rumors the killer attacked women wearing that color, Ha said.  \"There was a big rumor about the red clothes (attracting the killer). The third killing involved a woman, Lee, who worked at a department store in Suwon.\"Hong, the Taean-eup resident, remembers that men were afraid of being questioned by police. The village became quiet and eerie, he said. \"We were worried for being mistaken as criminals, so we didn't go out drinking either. Even if we hadn't done anything, things could get out of our hands.\"The investigationWhen the first victim was murdered, the responsibility fell to local police to investigate. But after three females were found dead within three months, they brought in investigators from a nearby city to help. \"From the third killing, the police saw that it was a serious case. It had wide media coverage and local residents were frightened,\" said detective Ha, who was one of the leaders of the investigation, in a lengthy interview last year on the South Korean YouTube channel he created to highlight cases he worked on. By then, police were sure that they were looking for a serial killer, but Ha said they had few clues. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\nVideo taken during the original investigation of the Hwaseong serial killings.

(Credit: JTBC)\n\n\nIt was a time before surveillance cameras or phone tracking, and before DNA evidence was widely available. Police had to rely on other, more creative measures to catch the killer.The first five murders happened within a 6 km (3.7 mile) radius in Hwaseong so police spread out in teams of two, dotted every 100 meters (328 feet), Ha said. It didn't work: the next killing happened where there was no police presence.Some female police officers wore red and tried to lure the killer into a trap, others went to a clairvoyant who told them to find a man with a missing finger, and some became so frustrated that they performed a shamanistic ritual on a voodoo scarecrow, Ha said. But the killings kept happening. Police logged more than 2 million days on the case -- a record for an investigation in South Korea, according to news agency Yonhap. \"The more we looked (at the victim's bodies), (the more) we couldn't hide our feeling of powerlessness, our anger at the killer,\" said Ha, who is now retired and in his 70s, in his YouTube video.     \"After months spent on the rice paddies and fields tracking the killer, I can say that our hatred of him was beyond imagination.\"Yoon was the only person ever convicted of any of the 10 murders. Police suspected he carried out a copycat killing -- all the other victims had been murdered outside, said Ha, who wasn't involved in Yoon's investigation. The other nine murders went unsolved.A breakthrough For many years, it seemed that one of South Korea's most infamous serial killers would never be found. The mystery was revisited in \"Memories of Murder,\" a 2003 film by \"Parasite\" director Bong Joon Ho. Then a few years later, as the statute of limitations expired for the last victim, it became clear that, even if the killer was found, there would be no trial or justice for the victims' families. But the murders didn't leave Hwaseong's collective memory, even as the villages eventually incorporated into a small city. And the police didn't give up their search.       Video taken during the original investigation into the Hwaseong serial killings. Date unknown (Credit: KBS)In September 2019, Gyeonggi Nambu Provincial Police superintendent general Ban Gi-soo, the latest police officer in charge of the investigation, made an explosive announcement. In July, police sent evidence that had been held in their files for 30 years to the National Forensic Service for DNA testing.The DNA evidence from at least three of the murders matched one man: Lee Chun-jae. Lee is currently in prison serving a life sentence for the 1994 rape and murder of his sister-in-law, according to Daejeon court officials and South Korea's Justice Ministry. It was huge news in South Korea.A month later, there was another development. Lee confessed to all 10 of the Hwaseong murders, and four others that police did not provide details on. He had given a detailed confession, even drawing on a piece of paper to explain the locations of the killings, an official from Gyeonggi Nambu Provincial Police Agency said. Lee Chun-jae's high school graduation photo, left, and a facial composite of the Hwaseong serial killer. (Credit: Korea Times)\"It is an important case that had prompted questions all over Korea,\" the official said.  \"The victims and their families had strongly demanded (the truth).\" It was a major breakthrough in one of the country's most infamous serial killing cases. But it also left authorities in a tricky position.If Lee murdered all 10 people -- including the 13-year-old -- then Yoon had spent 20 years in prison for a murder he didn't commit.Lee's confession alone wasn't enough to clear Yoon's name. In the eyes of the law, he was still a convicted murderer.Three days of no sleepThese days, Yoon is a gregarious man in his 50s. He works at a leather processing factory in North Chungcheong Province, a few hours' train ride from Seoul, and he still walks with a limp. On the surface, he is cheerful and sociable, a man who speaks loudly and laughs freely.But his life has been one of hardship.As a child, Yoon's family moved around, Yoon says. When Yoon was in his third year at school, his mother passed away in a car accident. After that, his father disappeared, and Yoon quit school to start work. Yoon came to Hwaseong, where he begged outside a fried chicken restaurant for a year, he said. When he was about 11, he began working at a farming tool center, and by 22 was training at the same center to become a qualified technician. He was a heavy smoker, and had never been in a relationship with a woman, he told police in his confession. \"I haven't even tried talking to girls because I thought no one would like a disabled person like me,\" he said. His former boss, Hong, remembers him as always being a bit sad. \"I think it was because he grew up without his parents,\" Hong said. \"He wasn't very articulate and didn't express his feelings much. He was excellent at repairing machines though.\"After the police took him away, Yoon remembers being kept handcuffed in the interrogation room for three days. He barely ate, and was only allowed to leave to go to the toilet. Whenever he tried to sleep, police would wake him up. \"Those times were much like a nightmare,\" he said. \"When you don't get sleep for three days, you don't know what you said. You don't remember what you did. You can't think properly. \"You just go along with their questions, on and on.\"Nowadays, Yoon thinks that he was mistreated, but at the time, Yoon didn't know anything about law -- he hadn't even finished elementary school.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     \nYoon served 20 years in prison for the murder and rape of a girl in 1988.

(Credit: Yoonjung Seo)\n\n\nYoon ultimately signed three confessions and at trial he admitted to the murder, hoping to avoid the death penalty. He served 20 years.\"He must have felt everything was so unfair, spending years in prison,\" said Hong, who went out of business when Yoon went to jail as he couldn't continue his company without Yoon's skill set. \"I lost my business, but he lost his life.\"Last December,  Gyeonggi Namu Provincial Police launched a formal probe into the conduct of seven police officers and one prosecutor who worked on the original investigation into the killings, including reviewing allegations of abuse of power during arrests. The results of the  investigation haven't been released yet. Yoon's experience wasn't totally unusual for the time. In the 1980s, it was common for suspected criminals in South Korea to be kept awake for long periods to extract a confession, according to Lee Soo-jung, a forensic psychology professor at Kyonggi University. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was a time when confessions, without evidence, were enough to get someone convicted.\"Lee Soo-jung\n\n\nAnd it wasn't just Yoon who accused police of torture. Kim Chil-joon, an attorney who defended other suspects in the Hwaseong murder case, said many people were abused during the investigation. One of his clients, also surnamed Kim, was accused of the fourth and fifth killings after a medium in the United States said they had seen him in their dream, he said. Kim was subject to torture and interrogation and in 1995 successfully sued the government for damages. But Kim took his own life two years later after bouts of depression and PTSD, Kim Chil-joon said. Last year, chief inspector Ban said police were investigating whether officers abused suspects during the original investigation, revisiting allegations that one man was waterboarded with spicy seafood soup. But these officers will likely never be charged -- the statute of limitations has run out on those allegations, too. \"I want my honor back\"Yoon is determined to clear his name, and his retrial began this week. That in itself is a rare event in South Korea.A tiny fraction of applications for retrials are accepted and they generally require new evidence, according to lawyer Heo Yoon, who specializes in providing retrial legal advice. Park Joon-young, one of Yoon's attorneys, says that evidence is rarely kept for longer than 20 years except in the most high-profile cases -- like Hwaseong. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow a serial killing case stretched on for decades\n\n\n\n\n1986\n\n\n\nA woman is found dead in Hwaseong.

It's possible that the convicted murderer will testify in court before the three judges,  who have the power to overturn Yoon's conviction, Park said. There's a good chance he'll be acquitted. At a pre-retrial hearing in February, the presiding judge verbally apologized for Yoon's false conviction. Yet, there are still issues with Yoon's case. Although Lee's DNA matches a number of the murders, police have not announced any DNA evidence connecting him with the 13-year-old girl.Also, pubic hairs found at the scene returned a 40% match with Yoon's, according to a 1989 report written by an expert at National Forensic Service (NFS). Those hairs have not been DNA tested -- and even if they do ultimately match Yoon's, his lawyer Park warns it's possible that a sample taken from Yoon could have been mixed up with evidence taken from the scene of the murder. The court has ordered the NFS to extract DNA from the hair, Park said.The retrial is expected to take place over a number of months, but if Yoon is found not guilty, he can make a claim for compensation, according to Park.Yoon says nothing can compensate him for the 20 years of life he lost. Even when he was freed from prison 10 years ago, the world had changed so much that initially he wanted to go back in. \"It took me around three years to adjust,\" he said. \"I couldn't live. My life patterns at the prison didn't accommodate the new world I was faced with.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I want to clear my false accusation, and I want my honor back. I want to be satisfied with these, and that's all.\"Yoon\n\n\nYoon knows Lee will never be tried for the crime, nor will the police officers who he says tortured him, because too many years have passed since the sleepless nights he spent in that small police interrogation room.He just wants to live the rest of his life as an innocent man.\"I want to clear my false accusation, and I want my honor back,\" he says. \"I want to be satisfied with these, and that's all.\" Julia Hollingsworth wrote from Wellington, New Zealand.

        "content": "Whanganui, New Zealand (CNN)As a child in the 1970s, Gerrard Albert played on the mud flats at the mouth of New Zealand's Whanganui River where raw sewage from the nearby town spilled into the estuary and out to the ocean. At low tide, he and his playmates would see pieces of toilet paper in the water and joke to one another: \"That was the one I did yesterday.\" After arriving in New Zealand in the 1800s, British colonialists industrialized Whanganui River, long treasured by generations of Indigenous M\u0101ori. The river became polluted by discharge and land clearances and the shingle banks Albert's grandmother remembered from her childhood were replaced with mud so wet you would sink up to your knees, due to gravel extraction.Albert wasn't bothered by the sewage where they fished and played. But the degraded river was emblematic of a bigger issue: a fight that stretched back to the 1870s to preserve the river and its relationship with M\u0101ori. In 2017, that fight finally came to an end.\n\n\n\n Credit: Julia Hollingsworth, CNN\nRead MoreWhanganui River became the first in the world to be considered a legal person. New Zealand's third-longest river could now be represented in court and had two guardians appointed to speak on its behalf.It was a move mimicked by other countries and praised by Indigenous rights advocates and environmentalists alike. But three years on, there's a sense that winning legal personhood isn't the end of the struggle to uphold M\u0101ori rights to the river. Albert, and others, are still facing the challenge of what happens after a river is seen as a legal person.\nA source of food, a single highway, a spiritual mentorFor hundreds of years, M\u0101ori lived in settlements along the Whanganui River, which translates to \"big harbor\" in M\u0101ori.The 290 kilometer (180 mile) waterway was central to their lives. It was where they fished and lived. The water was used to treat the sick. They considered the river an ancestor -- it was \"their source of food, their single highway, their spiritual mentor,\" according to a 1999 report on M\u0101ori rights to the Whanganui River.Then, in the 1800s, British colonizers began settling all over New Zealand, including Whanganui.It was a tense and often violent time. Huge swathes of land were bought in what are now seen as unfair deals -- in 1840, a British businessman bought 40,000 acres (16,200 hectares), an area almost three times the size of Manhattan -- in exchange for 700 pounds worth of goods, including muskets, umbrellas and musical instruments. Other land was violently confiscated from M\u0101ori who challenged the authority of the incoming British colonizers. As they gained territory, the newcomers imposed new rules over the land and sea. Under English law, the river wasn't seen as one entity. It was seen as a patchwork of legally separate parts -- water and river beds and air space above the water -- all controlled by different laws. The parts of the river that were navigable, for instance, were legally separate from the parts that were not. A M\u0101ori pa, or fortified village, on the Whanganui River, on the North Island of New Zealand in 1902.Te Mataruru Marae -- or M\u0101ori communal place -- in Whanganui district in the 1880s. Photograph taken by the studio of William James Harding. Right from the start, that was a problem. To M\u0101ori, the river was a single and indivisible entity and not something that could be owned. Although the river's resources could be used, only people who contributed to the community had the right to benefit. The local M\u0101ori even had a proverb they used to sum it up: \"I am the river, and the river is me.\"But as the Europeans -- or Pakeha as they are known in New Zealand -- took more control of the area, they increasingly destroyed what the river had been. They operated a steamer, took the river's gravel, released trout into the rivers for fishing and destroyed the old fishing weirs where M\u0101ori had fished for generations. M\u0101ori settlements were pushed back from the river to make way for new developments. Under M\u0101ori belief, all things have mauri -- a life force and personality. When the river's water quality was degraded, the mauri of the river wasn't respected, in turn affecting the mauri of the local people, who relied on the river to sustain them.Longest running litigation in New ZealandFor almost as long as settlers have been in Whanganui, local M\u0101ori fought to have their own view of the river recognized.Back in 1870, M\u0101ori began petitioning the colonial government, asking them to uphold their rights. In the decades that followed, a steady stream of petitions were made to the government in New Zealand's capital Wellington. By the 1920s and 1930s, Albert's grandmother and her brothers and sisters contributed anything they could to the legal case. \"Our people weren't rich by any means,\" Albert said. \"It was so fundamental to upholding our rights.\"A paddle steamer at Pipiriki on the Whanganui River, circa 1910.A view of the Whanganui River in 1872. All over New Zealand, M\u0101ori tribes -- or iwi -- were having similar fights with the New Zealand government. In 1840, many iwi chiefs had signed an agreement called the Treaty of Waitangi with the British Queen, which recognized M\u0101ori ownership of their land and gave M\u0101ori the protection of British subjects. Many felt that the Crown hadn't upheld her end of the bargain.In 1975, the government established the Waitangi Tribunal to hear iwi grievances -- and 10 years later, it allowed grievances that stretched back to 1840, including the violent period when land had been stolen from M\u0101ori.By the time the Waitangi Tribunal came to Whanganui in the 1990s, people there had already been fighting for their rights for more than 100 years. Years of development had left their river even worse off: Fish had been depleted -- some species had gone altogether -- and the river was no longer the main source of food. Sewage discharge and run off from riverside farms polluted the water and local M\u0101ori continued to live in deprivation. \"Our people are tired, they're fed up, they feel embarrassed to come along continually and to say who they are, what is theirs,\" Albert's uncle Archie Taiaroa, a key figure in the proceedings, told the Tribunal in 1994.Still, people of all ages spoke at the tribunal in Whanganui -- including Albert's grandmother. Not all of what was said was recorded in official records -- some witnesses didn't speak English, and there were no recording or translation services, Albert said. Many spoke of the significance of the river. \"I had no option about it, I had no right to choose it, it is my way of life to belong to the river,\" one local M\u0101ori Matiu Mareikura told the tribunal, according to the report. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"I had no option about it, I had no right to choose it, it is my way of life to belong to the river.\"Matiu Mareikura\n\n\n\nThat frustration was on display in 1995, when M\u0101ori led a sit-in at a Whanganui Park that ended peacefully after 79 days. During the sit-in, protesters beheaded a statue of Irish-born politician John Ballance, who had settled in Whanganui, to express their anger over unresolved territorial issues. Even today, the statue is missing -- only a plinth bearing his name remains in the town's Moutoa Gardens. In 1999, the Tribunal concluded that the river was a treasure -- or taonga -- to Whanganui M\u0101ori, and urged redress. But negotiations on New Zealand's longest running litigation stalled, and Whanganui M\u0101ori still didn't have legal rights over the river. 'We don't do revolutions here\"By 2008, Albert's uncle decided he longer wanted to try to fit into Pakeha laws. Taiaroa and Albert launched a new settlement process, but this time they wanted to create their own legal framework -- something that truly represented what the river meant to M\u0101ori. \"No discussing Crown constructs. We'll go with our own (legal) constructs,\" Albert remembers Taiaroa saying. \"It's pointless continuing, reinventing ourselves around their constructs.\"The timing was good. In 2008, New Zealand's center-right National Party won an election. Incoming Minister for Treaty Negotiations Chris Finlayson felt things had \"languished\" under the previous government's nine years in power and was keen to get progress on land settlements underway.

In what Albert described as \"flash\" law offices overlooking the capital Wellington's harbor, they began talking about treating the river as one, indivisible being that had rights, just like a person. In short, the way M\u0101ori had seen it all along.Giving rights to natural entities wasn't entirely new. In 1972, United States legal scholar Christopher Stone wrote an article titled \"Should trees have standing,\" where he argued that natural entities should have some of the same legal rights as humans. That wasn't so much of a stretch -- companies and ships can be legal people and guardians can be appointed to speak on behalf of others, such as children or people with disabilities, who can't speak for themselves. But at the time, Albert didn't know about Stone -- \"I didn't have a clue who he was.\" He just wanted the river to have the legal recognition his forefathers had been fighting for for decades.Chris Finlayson on November 5, 2014 in Wellington, New Zealand.In the halls of Parliament, other politicians weren't paying attention to the groundbreaking legal agreement being negotiated in their midst, Finlayson remembers. But as a lawyer himself, legal personhood made sense. \"None of this was particularly radical or groundbreaking,\" he said. In fact, the European centric way of thinking about land was \"weird,\" he said.\"What's more absurd? To look at a river as a single holistic entity from where it's formed out to the sea, to saying we're going to divide the river up?\" he questioned. \"That's a pretty potty way of thinking about things in my view.\"By the time Whanganui River became the first river in the world to have legal personhood, many of the people who had fought to make it happen were no longer alive.One key leader, Titi Tihu, died in 1988 aged about 100 years old -- like many M\u0101ori of his generation, he didn't have a birth certificate. At the time of his death, he had been involved in judicial and parliamentary proceedings over the river for 50 years. Albert's uncle, Archie Taiaroa died in 2010, as Sir Archie, having accepted a knighthood the year before for services to M\u0101ori. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"What's more absurd? To look at a river as a single holistic entity from where it's formed out to the sea, to saying we're going to divide the river up?\"Chris Finlayson\n\n\n\nThe men didn't live to see the outcome. But they had fought for future generations, and they had won.  Under the 2017 law, Te Awa Tupua was recognized as an \"indivisible and living whole, comprising the Whanganui River from the mountains to the sea, incorporating all its physical and metaphysical elements.\" Two guardians were appointed by local M\u0101ori to speak on the river's behalf. To Finlayson, it was an important move, but not groundbreaking. \"We don't do revolutions here,\" Finlayson said, after the law was passed. Albert believes Finlayson is playing down his role: \"He knows what he's done here.\" What happens after a river gets legal personhood?In the three years since Whanganui River gained legal personhood, Albert's inbox has been flooded by emails from around the world. He's now the chair of Nga Tangata Tiaki O Whanganui, the post-settlement governance body for the local M\u0101ori. Other countries have followed Whanganui's lead -- two rivers in India have been declared legal entities, and last year Bangladesh gave all its rivers legal rights. Environmental rights activists want Albert to speak at conferences. Indigenous groups want to know if that means the river can now sue people who pollute it.But Albert doesn't want to take polluters or anyone else to court, at least not at the moment. \"We've got this legal thing that we could use and wield it like a club, (but) we're not going to do that.\" Whanganui River as seen from the town center on June 11, 2020. \"When you've spent 150 years yourself of being thrown around and abused, why would we seek to be punitive and do the same thing to others?\" he questioned. \"(Legal personhood) is a paradigm shift, first and foremost.\" The problem with paradigm shifts is that they can take a while to work effectively. And in the three years since the legislation has been in place, Albert says there have been some problems. For example, the river's guardians weren't consulted about plans for a new bicycle bridge over the river, Albert said. They don't support it as they don't see why the additional development is necessary, but they don't want to kick up a fuss.\"We don't want to dictate, we want to be part of our community. But we do not want to be downgraded and ignored and used as the kicking board any longer,\" he said. He prefers diplomacy to threats of legal action -- he'd rather foster goodwill with the community.Gerrard Albert speaks during a ceremony on August 15, 2019 in Auckland, New Zealand.Hera Smith, who has made a career out of helping iwi put in place their vision following treaty settlements, says there has already been tangible change as a result of the river's legal personhood. People's relationship with the river has improved and others have set up environmental projects along its banks, she said. But she still says it will take time -- possibly generations -- for people to change their mindset about how they relate to the environment, to understand that they are not the masters of the river. The bigger pictureEnvironmental law experts see the Whanganui River decision as a shift -- not only for the people who live along the river, but possibly further afield. Jacinta Ruru, an expert in environmental and M\u0101ori law at Otago University who is of M\u0101ori descent, says legal personhood represents a fundamental move from a Western to a M\u0101ori perspective -- although new laws aren't always needed to change attitudes.\n\n\n\nCredit: Julia Hollingsworth, CNN\n\"The last hundreds of years has been all through this colonization process of dismantling Indigenous cultures and certainly not thinking of them as having anything to add to us in the world order,\" she said. \"That's really got to change. As we're starting to face really huge critical issues -- climate change, adaptation, sea level rise, the ramifications of the collapse of the economy after Covid, we've got to look to all of the knowledges, we've got to be more embracing of as many knowledges and cultures as we can.\"Erin O'Donnell, a water law expert at the University of Melbourne, thinks legal personhood could help with environmental protection of other natural resources, especially at a time when the effects of climate change are being felt worldwide. \"When we see rivers as living beings that are part of our community then that does actually profoundly change the way we speak about them, they way we make laws about them, the way we make decisions about them,\" she said. The legal protection was still so new it was \"too early to tell\" how effective human guardians would be, she said, noting that few cases involving legal personhood had made it to the courts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When we see rivers as living beings that are part of our community then that does actually profoundly change the way we speak about them.\"Erin O'Donnell\n\n\n\nBack in Whanganui, Albert doesn't see the river's legal personhood as primarily an environmental issue. It's about acknowledging and respecting M\u0101ori -- something that can have flow-on effects to how M\u0101ori are treated more broadly.  M\u0101ori in Whanganui continue to earn less on average and are more likely to be unemployed than their European counterparts, statistics show. That's been the case across New Zealand for decades and fits into a bigger cycle of systematic discrimination that sees M\u0101ori experience poorer health and education outcomes and higher rates of incarceration than non-M\u0101ori.To Albert, it's all very well for politicians to give M\u0101ori kids free lunches to address poverty -- as Jacinda Ardern's Labour Party has promised to do -- but that doesn't mean much if their teachers dismiss their cultural heritage.He feels the Whanganui River's personhood is a start towards valuing M\u0101ori and their world view. \"It's as much a social contract, and a political contract, as it is a legal construct,\" he says. \"It's not about what we're taking from the river, it's about what we're giving to it.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Kathleen Folbigg has spent the past 18 years in prison for one of the most horrific crimes imaginable: killing all four of her babies. But new scientific evidence suggests that's not what happened. Genomic testing shows at least two of the Australian's babies likely died from a previously undiscovered genetic mutation that led to heart complications -- meaning she may have been wrongfully imprisoned for almost two decades. The finding has prompted 90 scientists -- including two Australian Nobel Laureates -- to ask the governor of New South Wales to pardon Folbigg and let her walk free. If that happens, Folbigg's case will be one of the worst miscarriages of justice in Australian history.The ramifications don't end there.Read MoreWhile scientists are still learning about the causes of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) -- an umbrella term for when children die suddenly from unexplained causes -- the findings in Folbigg's case may help other parents who are grieving the unexpected loss of their own children.Early yearsRight from the start, Folbigg's life was marred by tragedy. When she was 18 months old, her father stabbed her mother to death and served 15 years in prison for murder before being deported to England. She was a disruptive child with behavioral issues that one medical officer said could indicate she was abused as a baby by her father, according to a 2019 inquiry into Folbigg's convictions.In the late 1980s, she married Craig Folbigg, who she had met at a disco in the Australian city of Newcastle. They had their first child when she was 21, a boy named Caleb.Kathleen Folbigg leaving Maitland Court after being refused bail on March 22, 2004. \"(She) described herself as feeling completed, with a husband, home and a baby,\" the inquiry noted. Then, when he was just 19 days old, Caleb died. The cause of death was given as SIDS -- essentially, the absence of evidence of any other cause. Folbigg soon fell pregnant again, and in 1990 she had another son, Patrick. Tests showed he was normal and healthy. But at four months, he had an unexplained ALTE, an apparent life-threatening event, that left him with brain damage and seizures. Four months later, he died as a consequence of seizures.Her third child, Sarah, died age 10 months -- her cause of death was listed as SIDS. When her fourth daughter, Laura, died age 18 months on March 1, 1999, police started investigating. The couple's marriage broke down. After Folbigg left, her husband found her diary and read an entry that he said made him want to vomit. He took the diary to police on May 19, 1999, according to the inquiry. On April 19, 2001, Folbigg was arrested and charged with four counts of murder.Her childhood best friend Tracy Chapman describes Folbigg as a caring animal lover who was a \"really good mom.\" But at trial in 2003, the prosecution argued Folbigg had smothered her children. There was no conclusive forensic proof -- instead, the prosecution relied on a maxim credited to British pediatrician Roy Meadow: \"One sudden infant death is a tragedy, two is suspicious and three is murder, until proven otherwise.\"The prosecutor compared the chance of the children dying of natural causes to pigs flying. \"I can't disprove that one day some piglets might be born with wings and that they might fly. Is that some reasonable doubt? No,\" the prosecutor told the jury during the 2003 trial. \"There has never ever been before in the history of medicine that our experts have been able to find any case like this. It is preposterous. It is not a reasonable doubt. It is a fantasy and, of course, the Crown does not have to disprove a fanciful idea.\"  The prosecution pointed to Folbigg's journals, which they said contained virtual admissions of guilt.\"I feel like the worst mother on this Earth, scared that (Laura) will leave me now, like Sarah did. I knew I was short tempered and cruel sometimes to her and she left, with a bit of help,\" Folbigg wrote in one. \"It can't happen again. I'm ashamed of myself. I can't tell (my husband) about it because he'll worry about leaving her with me.\"Craig Folbigg speaks to media outside the Supreme Court on May 21, 2001. Folbigg didn't confess, there was no obvious motive, and no one claimed to have seen her murder her children. But the jury found her guilty of the murder of three children and the manslaughter of one. Folbigg was eventually sentenced on appeal to 30 years in prison with a non-parole period of 25 years. By the time she is eligible for parole, Folbigg will be 60 years old.  The fight to get her outThe term SIDS was introduced in 1969 as a way to categorize the unexplainable. By the 1980s, cases that might have been classified as homicides in the past were attributed to SIDS, UK pediatric pathologist John L. Emery noted in a 1985 paper. By the 1990s, scientists had developed a model demonstrating that a range of factors lead to SIDS, including exposure to smoke and sleeping position.Over the past two decades, however, there has been a growing understanding of genetic factors. One of the first studies into this came in 2001, when Mayo Clinic pediatric cardiologist Michael Ackerman and a team of scientists linked a mutation in the SCN5A gene to SIDS. Since then, genetic variations in more than 30 different genes have been linked to SIDS and sudden unexpected deaths in children (SUDC) -- a term for children who die when they are more than one year old. Studies now indicate up to 35% of SIDS cases may be explained by genetic factors, although the cause of the majority of cases remains unclear.In 2015, with her appeals exhausted, Folbigg's lawyers submitted a petition to the governor of New South Wales, asking him to direct that an inquiry be held into her convictions. The lawyers argued new evidence had come to light since her unsuccessful appeals -- including a growing understanding of SIDS -- that lead to a \"feeling of disquiet\" over her convictions. If the former NSW District Court chief judge Reginald Blanch, who headed the inquiry, agreed, he could refer the case back to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Kathleen Folbigg was questioned again about the deaths of her four children during an inquiry in 2019. As part of that inquiry, Folbigg's legal team approached Prof. Carola Vinuesa, co-director of the Centre for Personalised Immunology at Australian National University, to ask her to sequence the children's genomes to see if there was a genetic mutation that could have caused SIDS. \"There was a chance -- even though it might be a long shot -- that (Folbigg) was carrying something that might be passed on to the children,\" Vinuesa said. \"To my knowledge, this is the first case in which a court (anywhere in the world) has used whole genome sequencing to find evidence of a cause of death.\"During the inquiry, Vinuesa and her team sequenced Folbigg's genome and found a previously unreported variation in the CALM2 gene which controls how calcium is transported in and out of heart cells. Studies have found variations in the CALM 2 genes can cause heart problems in young children, meaning they are among the best recognized causes of SIDS and SUDC. When they sequenced the genomes of all four children, they found both daughters carried the same CALM2 mutation as their mother. After the inquiry had closed, more evidence came to light, prompting Vinuesa and her team to write to the judge telling him it was likely the daughters died as a result of the variant. Despite the new finding, Judge Blanch opted not to reopen the inquiry. After taking all the evidence -- including the diaries -- into account, Blanch said he remained of the view Folbigg had smothered Sarah and Laura.New developmentsLast November, scientists published even more compelling evidence.Led by Danish professor Michael Toft Overgaard, a team of experts across six countries found the CALM2 variant in Folbigg and her two girls could cause disease -- just like other CALM2 variants. They concluded the variant altered the girls' heart rhythm, making them susceptible to heart conditions -- particularly given the medication they were given. Sarah was on antibiotics for a cough, while Laura was being treated with paracetamol and pseudoephedrine for a respiratory infection shortly before she died. Laura had inflammation of the heart when she died to the extent that three professors said they would have listed it as her cause of death. \"We consider the variant likely precipitated the natural deaths of the two female children,\" the researchers wrote in a study published in November 2020 in medical journal EP Europace. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"To my knowledge, this is the first case in which a court (anywhere in the world) has used whole genome sequencing to find evidence of a cause of death.\"Professor Carola Vineusa\n\n\nIn both of the boys, scientists found other variations in their BSN, also known as Bassoon, genes -- one variant had been inherited from their mother, and the other likely from their father, although he refused to provide a sample to the researchers. When both copies of the BSN gene are defective in mice it can cause them to die young during epileptic fits. Scientists are still investigating whether this variant could have caused the two boys' deaths. Patrick experienced seizures before he died. Only 75 people in the world are known to carry mutations in their CALM1, CALM2 or CALM3 genes that have been shown to be lethal in children. But while genetic mutations that cause SIDS may be rare in the general population, once a parent has a genetic mutation there is a high chance of them passing it on, Vinuesa says.\"In the end it's not about these variations being very rare in the world, it's about the chances of Kathleen meeting someone like Craig and having this combination of mutations between both of them. Once genetics come into play, statistics go out the window,\" Vinuesa added.  Vinuesa said the case shows that contrary to what was suggested at trial, there doesn't need to be one explanation for all four of the deaths.\"The pathology already told us there were different causes,\" Vinuesa said. The research hasn't yet freed Folbigg, but it has already had an impact. Folbigg's lawyers launched a case in the New South Wales Court of Appeal, arguing that the commissioner of the 2019 inquiry incorrectly applied the law to his decisions. The genome findings also prompted a petition with more than 90 signatures to the New South Wales governor earlier this month. \"It is deeply concerning that medical and scientific evidence has been ignored in preference of circumstantial evidence. We now have an alternative explanation for the death of the Folbigg children,\" Prof. Fiona Stanley, who has been recognized for her work on child health, said in a statement at the time of the petition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The reality is, Kath's lost four children. And she hasn't been allowed to grieve as a mother should.\"Tracy Chapman\n\n\nA spokesperson for Gov. Margaret Beazley said the state's attorney general is considering the petition and will advise her. According to New South Wales' Department of Communities and Justice, few people have ever received a pardon by the state. Even if Folbigg is freed, her legal fight may not be over. She will need to go to the Court of Criminal Appeal to get her conviction overturned if she wants to clear her name -- and it will be another legal matter again if she wants to get compensation for the years she's spent in prison. For Folbigg, the research offers some hope -- but it was also emotional for her to hear, says Chapman, who talks to Folbigg every day.\"You're being told potentially the thing that you carried has been passed onto the children. So that's emotionally quite heart-wrenching,\" Chapman said. \"The reality is, Kath's lost four children. And she hasn't been allowed to grieve as a mother should.\" Science in the court roomFolbigg's case is part of a bigger picture -- a growing understanding of SIDS, a changing view about what multiple deaths in a family means, and a wider criticism of how science is presented in the courtroom. Much of Folbigg's conviction was based on a maxim credited to Meadows that three infant deaths are murder, unless proven otherwise -- a maxim that had already started to draw skepticism. Two women in the United Kingdom convicted on the basis of Meadow's maxim had their convictions overturned in 2003. In one of those cases, the appeal judge said: \"Unless we are sure of guilt, the dreadful possibility always remains that a mother, already brutally scarred by the unexplained death or deaths of her babies, may find herself in prison for life for killing them when she should not be there at all. \"In our community, and in any civilized community, that is abhorrent.\"In a similar case to Folbigg's, Australian woman Carol Matthey was accused of murdering her four children between 1998 and 2003, but the case against her was dropped due to a lack of evidence -- even though the same experts that testified against Folbigg were set to do so against Matthey. In 2019, Judge Blanch said after taking all the evidence into the account he still believed that Kathleen Folbigg smothered Sarah and Laura.\"(Folbigg) could very well be innocent,\" Matthey told the \"60 Minutes\" TV show. \"Medical experts get things wrong, police get things wrong.\"Gary Edmond, a law professor at the University of New South Wales who is an expert in trial evidence and forensic science, said it was unfortunate Folbigg went to trial when she did. If she was tried a few years later, when the doubt over Meadow's maxim was better established, the courts might have been more cautious about admitting the expert evidence used to convict her, he said. But even now, the way Australian courts handle evidence is outdated -- and lagging behind United States, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, Edmond said. While other jurisdictions assess whether science is reliable before it comes to court, Australia's system leaves it up to the juries to decide what's valid. That's a problem because juries don't have enough knowledge to make complex scientific judgments, Edmond said. Folbigg's lawyer Rhanee Rego -- who has been working on her case for almost five years unpaid -- agrees courts need to be careful about which experts are allowed to give evidence. \"I think that one of the biggest lessons we can take from this case is that we need to listen more carefully in the legal system to peer-reviewed and evidence-based science and medicine,\" she said.Genetic answersThe advances in genetic testing -- including the findings in Folbigg's case -- could also help give answers for others dealing with the unexplained deaths of their children.  Vinuesa says it's likely that in the next few years, other families who have experienced SIDS will find a genetic mutation is to blame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need to listen more carefully in the legal system to peer reviewed and evidence-based science and medicine.\"Rhanee Rego\n\n\n\"In most families where there have been SIDS deaths, nobody has yet gone back and sequenced the genomes of the children,\" she said. As molecular autopsies become more common, she thinks there will be more genetic explanations for otherwise unexplained deaths. That could help families looking for answers -- and also help those worried about being targeted by the law. \"Many families live in fear, because they've had two or more children dying and they're worried that one day someone will be knocking at their door with some type of police investigation,\" she said. \"We know now that when you have a genetic condition ... it's not rare.\" Chapman says her childhood friend hopes her case helps other parents explain otherwise unexplainable deaths.\"It's not just about having Kath free,\" Chapman says. \"The most important thing after Kath is freed is that this never happens to anybody else ever again.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Trinh met her murderer through a matchmaker. She was 29 years old and her future husband was in his 50s, court documents show. She only spoke Vietnamese, he spoke Korean.Despite the communication barrier, the union went ahead. On November 4, 2018 -- a day after they met -- they were married in front of her family in Vietnam.Seven months later, Trinh -- a name CNN has chosen to use as her real name has been suppressed under South Korean law -- moved to South Korea to be with her husband, named Shin. Three months after that, she was dead.Trinh is one of thousands of Vietnamese women to marry South Korean men through matchmakers who set up brides with grooms -- a service that is not only encouraged in South Korea, it is even subsidized by local authorities. Read MoreSome couples have successful, happy marriages. But many foreign brides who meet men this way, officially classified as migrants through marriage, have become victims of discrimination, domestic violence and even murder at the hands of their husbands.     The statistics paint a grim picture. More than 42% of foreign wives reported having suffered domestic violence -- including physical, verbal, sexual, and financial abuse -- in a 2017 poll by the National Human Rights Commission. By comparison, about 29% of South Korean women surveyed by the country's Ministry of Gender Equality and Family last year said they were victims of domestic violence -- again including a range of forms of abuse. Experts say discriminatory rules, coupled with sexism and racism in society, are to blame, and are pushing for institutional changes to keep foreign brides safe.Communication issuesRight from the beginning, Trinh and Shin had difficulty communicating.After their wedding, Shin went home to South Korea, court documents show. They lived apart for months, and though they kept in touch via a messaging app, they fought frequently as Trinh often asked for additional financial support.  Finally, on August 16, 2019, Trinh arrived in South Korea. She moved to Yangju city in Gyeonggi Province, surrounding the capital Seoul, to live with her husband. The court documents did not specify why there was a delay in her arrival in South Korea, although a couple must meet specific criteria to get a spousal visa, including satisfying an income threshold.Yet the arguing continued, court records show. They disagreed often -- due to their language barrier, the difference in how they liked to live, and financial issues. Three months later, on November 16, Trinh told Shin she was leaving to live with a relative in another city. Shin tried to stop her, so she grabbed a knife from the kitchen and cut his right thigh, court records show.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The victim is now returning to her homeland as a corpse.\"Judge Kang Dong-hyeok\n\n\nAccording to court records, Shin took the knife and stabbed his wife about 10 times in the chest and stomach. After she died, Shin wrapped her body in plastic, put her and her and belongings into his car, and drove to a persimmon orchard in Wanju County, North Jeolla Province, more than 200 kilometers (124 miles) away from their home in Yangju.There, he buried her. In April, Shin was sentenced to 15 years in prison for Trinh's murder. Evidence presented at trial included stills from the crime scene, their international marriage contract, and the defendant's testimony.\"The defendant deserves a heavy jail term considering the pain the victim must have gone through, the bitter emotion that the victim had to end her life in a foreign country this way, and sadness for the victim's bereaved family who lost their beloved family member,\" Judge Kang Dong-hyeok said during sentencing. \"The victim is now returning to her homeland as a corpse.\" Foreign brides in South KoreaFor decades, there has been a gender imbalance in rural parts of South Korea. Young women often head to cities for jobs and marriage, while their male counterparts stay behind to tend their land and fulfill the Confucian expectation that they look after their elderly parents. In the 1980s, local governments started subsidizing private marriage brokers who could introduce bachelor farmers to ethnically Korean women in China, paying the brokers 4 to 6 million won (then around $3,800 to $5,700) per marriage. It was an attempt to address the aging population by encouraging men to find a wife, and hopefully have children. In the decades after, brides were no longer only ethnically Korean and began coming from more countries -- the Philippines, Vietnam and Cambodia.      An industry of transnational marriage brokers soon emerged. As of May, 380 matchmaking agencies were registered in South Korea, according to government statistics. These days, more foreign brides in South Korea come from Vietnam than any other country. Most marry men in rural areas of South Korea, where some provinces still offer subsidies -- South Jeolla province, for instance, offers men older than 35 who have never been married previously a 5 million won ($4,190) subsidy for marrying a foreign wife and presenting a marriage registration. In 2018, 16,608 Korean men and foreign women married, with 6,338 coming from Vietnam, 3,671 from China, and 1,560 from Thailand. In total, 28% of all marriages between a foreigner and a Korean person involved a South Korean man and a Vietnamese bride. Part of the reason so many brides come from Vietnam is economic. According to CIA World Factbook, Vietnam's GDP per capita was $6,900 in 2017 -- that same year, South Korea's was $39,500.  Brides are often young, and hoping for a better life. According to a government survey in 2017, the average age of marriage broker users was 43.6, while the average age of foreign brides was 25.2. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"The victim trusted the defendant -- she left Vietnam and began her life in South Korea.\"Judge Kang Dong-hyeok\n\n\nExperts and officials disagree on how to categorize this transnational trend. The United Nations Action for Cooperation against Trafficking in Persons says Vietnamese women are trafficked to a number of countries, including South Korea, for \"forced marriages.\"But Lee Jin-hye, a lawyer with Migrants Center Friends based in Seoul, said foreign brides are choosing to come to South Korea -- even if the primary reason is to send money to their families back home, rather than for their own personal benefit. In Trinh's case, court documents indicated she went to South Korea willingly. \"The victim trusted the defendant -- she left Vietnam and began her life in South Korea,\" Judge Kang said.What goes wrongThe South Korean government -- and countries in Southeast Asia -- have long worried that the foreign bride industry could lead to human trafficking and abuse.  In 2010, Cambodia temporarily banned its citizens from marrying South Koreans. Vietnamese authorities have also raised concerns with South Korea, according to local Vietnam media reports. In South Korea itself, the rules have also been tightened -- since 2014, Korean nationals and their foreign spouses must prove that they can communicate to get a visa. Applicants need to prove that the bride has at least basic Korean, or the couple can communicate in a third language. It's unclear how Trinh evaded this rule, despite the communication issues with her husband. There is no evidence of the husband's Vietnamese ability. Further, South Korea last year announced plans to prevent men with an abusive history from being allowed to sponsor a visa for a foreign bride. That law is set to take effect in October. South Korea's President says he's a feminist. Three of his allies have been accused of sex crimesBut there are still institutional issues in South Korea that put foreign brides and their husbands on an uneven footing.Under South Korea's immigration laws, foreign brides need their husbands to sponsor their initial visa, which lasts one year. After that, they need to renew their visa every three years. \"There are cases of husbands threatening to withdraw their (support for the visa) if a wife wants separation,\" said Lee, the lawyer. Women on a spousal visa can work in South Korea, and can eventually become permanent residents.If the couple divorces and does not have children, the wife must return to her home country, unless she can prove that her Korean spouse was responsible for the marriage breakdown or that she has been a victim of abuse and needs time to recover.\"These institutional conditions have the effect of strengthening the power of Korean spouses,\" said Heo Young-sook, head of the Korea Women Migrants Human Rights Center. \"Even when there are problems, migrant women feel that they should maintain their unhappy marriage because of these institutional issues.\"In the 2017 National Human Rights Commission survey, most foreign brides polled said they didn't tell anyone about the domestic violence they had suffered. They said they were embarrassed, didn't know who to tell, and didn't expect anything to change by doing so. What needs to changeIt's not easy being a woman in South Korea. The country ranks among the lowest in the OECD in the World Economic Forum's latest Global Gender Gap report, partly due to unequal political and employment opportunities for women. Over the past few years, sex crime allegations against entertainment stars, politicians and sports coaches have prompted a reckoning against what some see as a deeply patriarchal culture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Migrant women face multi-layered discrimination -- it often is gender discrimination and racial discrimination, combined with institutional issues, that create problems.\"Heo Young-sook,head of the Korea Women Migrants Human Rights Center\n\n\nAccording to Heo, life is even harder for foreign brides.\"Koreans often express a sense of inferiority to the West, even defining themselves as victims of racism, but act superior to people from countries where economic conditions are not as high as Korea,\" she said.\"Migrant women face multi-layered discrimination -- it often is gender discrimination and racial discrimination, combined with institutional issues, that create problems.\"That can play out in a number of ways. Lee, from Migrants Center Friends, says women often feel discriminated against by their own extended family -- their mother-in-law might complain about their cooking, and some families exclude foreign brides from decision making. Many wives don't get money to spend and have to ask for it, she added. The tide is slowly turning, however. This year, Justice Party lawmaker Jang Hye-yong proposed an anti-discrimination bill which, if passed, would be a first for the country.She's a top economics professor. But a South Korean politician wants her to contribute more to the country by having a babySouth Korea doesn't have a law guaranteeing legal protection against discrimination for all citizens, including minorities and LGBT people. The proposed bill aims to protect people facing discrimination, and gives the state the ability to resolve disputes and protect individuals. It's unclear when the bill will be voted on, although parliament returned on July 17.If approved, Jang believes the law could help migrant women, although the law doesn't specifically mention abuse against them. It does, however, prohibit indirect discrimination that causes physical or mental pain to a group or individual. \"If (the way migrant women are treated) is defined as discrimination and can be corrected, I think that many migrant women in our society can live more safely and with more dignity.\"Lee, the lawyer, doesn't believe that the bill will be a quick fix for migrant women. Instead, she thinks the bill will help bring about a social shift, improving awareness of racial discrimination at work, school and at home. \"I believe it will discourage people from making hate speech and encourage people to correct systematic discrimination. At least people will know what behavior and words are discriminatory and subject to punishment,\" she said.This story has been updated to accurately reflect South Korea's immigration laws around foreign spouses.",

        "content": "(CNN)Veronica was 21 years old and scared. It all started with a break-up. Her long-term boyfriend left her for her friend. Heartbroken, she ended up having a one-night stand with an older guy.After the condom broke, he gave her $20 ($13) for the morning after pill, which doesn't require a prescription in New Zealand. She took it but a month later, in the final semester of her teaching degree, she found out she was pregnant.Veronica -- who asked CNN not to use her real name out of concern for her privacy -- wanted to get an abortion. But it wasn't that simple.New Zealand is often seen as a progressive place for women. In 1893, it was the first self-governing country to give all adult women the right to vote. Its leader, Jacinda Ardern, is the country's third female prime minister. It ranked seventh globally for gender equality in the 2018 World Economic Forum Global Gender Gap report.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern speaks to media on May 30, 2019 in Wellington, New Zealand. Read MoreBut in New Zealand abortion is still a crime unless certain conditions are met. Before 20 weeks, abortions can only be performed for limited reasons, such as the pregnancy would seriously endanger the woman's life or her mental health. Rape or extreme youth are not grounds. Every abortion must be signed off by two specially appointed doctors. After 20 weeks, the conditions that permit an abortion become drastic. A woman who gets an unlawful abortion risks a $200 fine -- anyone who provides an unlawful abortion faces up to 14 years in prison.Veronica, who is now 30 and living overseas, was \"terrified,\" but it took her a month to get her abortion. During her 10 weeks of pregnancy, she battled heavy morning sickness, which prevented her from continuing school. She graduated a semester late, then found it hard to get a job as she had finished in the middle of the school year. Eventually, she left New Zealand to work overseas.\"It changed my entire life,\" she said. \"It didn't his.\" About 13,000 women like Veronica access abortions each year in New Zealand -- and an estimated 30% of women in that country have abortions during their lifetime.     Nevertheless, pro-choice groups say that the country's 42-year-old law creates stigma around abortion and forces women to jump through unnecessary hoops to get one, causing emotional, physical and financial distress.Earlier this year, in its review of the country's human rights, the United Nations Human Rights Council called on the New Zealand government to remove abortion from the Crimes Act. Finally, that could happen. Last Thursday, a bill to decriminalize abortion and strip the requirement for two-doctor sign-off passed its first reading in parliament. But for those already impacted by New Zealand's abortion laws, some wonder: What took so long?An anachronistic lawIn 1840, New Zealand became a British colony and subject to English law, which made abortion illegal. By the 1930s, however, New Zealand was self-governing and abortion could be accessed when a woman's life or mental health was in danger. But in practice, few doctors were willing to perform a termination.Over time, attitudes changed. In the late 1960s, abortion rates rose in New Zealand as women took ownership of their bodies and advantage of greater access to the procedure in public hospitals. In 1974, the country's first abortion clinic opened, pitting opponents who lobbied for tougher restrictions against those who supported greater access. While New Zealand updated its abortion laws in 1977, to allow for more circumstances in which an abortion was allowed, it was still listed in its Crimes Act. Soon after, a petition urging parliament to repeal the law gained 319,000 signatures -- around 10% of the country's population.  New Zealand Minister of Justice Andrew Little announces that abortion law will be modernized so that it is treated as a health issue on August 5, 2019, in Wellington, New Zealand. Since then, pro-choice groups have continued to push for law reform. But little changed -- until Ardern was elected.In 2017, Ardern made reforming the law one of her campaign promises -- and she has kept her word.   As the bill was introduced on Thursday, Ardern said: \"I am reflecting now, as we enter into this debate, on how long a journey it will have felt for many ... to reach this day.\"Many New Zealanders likely agree.A recent Ipsos poll showed 77% of New Zealanders thought women should be able to access abortion, compared with 84% in the United Kingdom and 68% in the United States. During the first reading of the bill, only 23 lawmakers voted against the bill while 94 voted for it.Terry Bellamak, the president of Abortion Law Reform Association of New Zealand (ALRANZ), said the main reason for the delay in changing the law had been \"political cowardice\" on the part of the country's legislators on this divisive issue. Those who oppose abortion are a small but vocal minority. Conservative group Family First NZ, for instance, said the proposed law ignores the rights of the unborn child. \"It takes a lot of courage for a politician to go out on this particular limb,\" Bellamak said. Another reason for the delay was a common feeling that there was no issue with the current rules, said Jackie Edmond, the chief executive of New Zealand Family Planning.Pro-life supporters look on during a pro-life, anti-abortion rally at Parliament on May 28, 2019 in Wellington, New Zealand. Afterall, despite it being listed in the Crimes Act, thousands of women access abortion each year and between 1980 and 2016, only 40 people were charged with procuring an abortion -- all these were in relation to assaults that were intended to cause, or did cause, a miscarriage. Only one person was convicted of unlawfully supplying pills that could cause an abortion.As center-right National Party MP Maureen Pugh put it before she voted against the bill on Thursday: \"I still struggle to understand what it is we are trying to fix.\"A necessary lieFor many New Zealand women who have come up against the law, it's clear what needs to be fixed.For a start, as Ardern said during the first reading of the bill, women often feel they have to lie to access an abortion. \"If they do tell the truth, then technically, under our law, they are a criminal, and I don't believe that that is right,\" she said. \"I fundamentally disagree with that.\"In 2017, 97% of abortions were authorized on the grounds that continuing the pregnancy would be a serious danger to the woman's mental health.  Sarah -- not her real name -- said she remembers feeling like she needed to lie about her mental health when she had an abortion at the age of 18. \"I remember feeling like I had to play it up, I had to exaggerate,\" said the 29-year-old public servant, who asked to remain anonymous to protect her privacy. Bellamak said lying can take a toll on women. \"It's like demanding that, in order to get healthcare, you have to undergo a ritual humiliation,\" she said. \"The women have to pretend to be mentally unstable and the doctors have to pretend to believe them.\"  Drawn-out processUnder New Zealand's current law, women must have at least three appointments before their abortion: one with a regular doctor, and then two meetings with specially appointed doctors. The number of appointments could increase if the initial doctor is a conscientious objector, meaning the woman must find another doctor to refer them. Dylan, who asked to use a pseudonym for privacy reasons, had an abortion in 2010 and is still angry about the drawn-out process. Now 31 and working as a teacher in Melbourne, Australia, back then Dylan was in a relationship but didn't plan to have a baby. \"I just wanted to not be pregnant as fast as possible,\" said Dylan, who had to endure morning sickness and fatigue while awaiting the procedure. \"It's a very disempowering feeling to be pregnant when you don't want to be pregnant.\"JUST WATCHEDMissouri rules against state's last abortion clinic ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMissouri rules against state's last abortion clinic  00:58Nevertheless, Dylan was lucky to have supportive friends, an open-minded family background, and to live in the capital Wellington, where abortion services are available. For New Zealanders living in remote areas, accessing the relevant doctors and then abortion services can be difficult, said Family Planning's Edmond. The west coast of South Island, for instance, doesn't have any abortion services, meaning women need to make the three-hour drive to Christchurch for a termination.For pregnant teenagers, women who already have children, or those with a full-time job, this can be  difficult, said Edmond.\"There is real serious inequity between the experience of people who live in urban areas or who are affluent, and people who live in rural areas and don't have as much money,\" Bellamak said.The drawn-out process can have health impacts, too. Having an abortion earlier in the pregnancy is quicker, cheaper, and generally less distressing for the woman. Before 12 weeks, women can take pills to induce a termination, but after that they are limited to a surgical abortion.  Stigma and fearA decade on, Dylan still doesn't feel comfortable talking about the abortion. \"I can't emphasize how much I was surrounded by people who didn't see abortion as a big deal, but I still felt that level of social stigma,\" Dylan said. \"I still feel reluctant to acknowledge to people that I was even pregnant.\"It's a very disempowering feeling to be pregnant when you don't want to be pregnant.Dylan, who had an abortion in 2010Listing abortion as a crime makes it less socially acceptable to talk about, said Veronica.\"People are afraid to talk about it because they think of the stigma,\" she said. \"Everyone that has one, they do it in secret.\" Edmond agreed that the current law pushed discussion of the issue underground. \"I think women are so grateful to get the service that they don't want to talk about it,\" she said. Parliament will now take submissions from the public on the bill, before it has its second and third readings, the dates of which are to be decided. With the vast majority of politicians supporting the bill at its first reading, it looks set to pass -- although, it will likely be a number of months before it does so.If the new bill had been in place 10 years ago, Dylan believes the process would have been far simpler and less traumatic. \"It makes you wonder, if a previous government had been braver, if this could have happened a lot sooner.\"",

Doctors sometimes simultaneously conduct multiple operations -- meaning they rely on substitutes who may be freshly qualified plastic surgeons, dentists, nurses, or, in some cases, medical equipment sales people -- to undertake some of the work for them. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity student Kwon Dae-hee often digitally altered his face to make it appear slimmer.\n\nKwon in military uniform. Like most young South Korean men, he undertook compulsory military service.\n\nKwon and his mother Lee Na Geum before his death. Lee is now fighting for justice for her son.\n\n\nUnder South Korean law, someone who orders or performs an unlicensed medical act is subject to a maximum punishment of five years in prison or a maximum fine of 50 million won ($44,000). If a ghost surgery is performed by a licensed doctor, that could lead to charges of causing harm or fraud. But these crimes are hard to prove -- many substitute doctors don't note down the work they've done and many clinics don't have CCTV cameras. And even once the cases get to court, ghost doctors rarely get heavy penalties, which emboldens clinics to continue with the practice, lawyers say. But Kwon's high-profile case has brought renewed attention to shadowy operators. His family aren't only bringing criminal charges against the doctors involved -- they're demanding legal changes, too.  Kwon's storyKwon was a warm and humble university student, the kind of son who cooked seaweed soup for his mother's birthday, his family remembers. He was a high-achiever but was insecure about his looks and believed plastic surgery could make him more successful, his brother said.In photos taken shortly before his death, Kwon had digitally altered his face to have the sort of pointy, V-like jaw seen on many K-pop idols. Kwon's elder brother and mother, Lee Na Geum, tried to talk him out of getting plastic surgery, but Kwon secretly booked into a well-known clinic that specialized in jawline surgeries in the glitzy Seoul neighborhood of Gangnam, an area traditionally home to the country's biggest K-pop labels. On September 8, 2016, a doctor removed bone to change the shape of Kwon's jawline, a popular surgery in East Asia that usually takes one to two hours. It cost 6.5 million won ($5,766), according to his mother.But Kwon's operation did not go as planned.After bleeding excessively, he was moved to hospital. At 9 a.m. the next morning, the plastic surgeon who had operated on Kwon arrived at the hospital. He told Kwon's family that the procedure had gone as normal and even offered CCTV footage of the operating room to prove it -- something that isn't required nationwide, but which some clinics do to increase trust. \"I immediately felt that I needed that evidence,\" said Kwon's mother, Lee.Lee watched the CCTV footage from the operating room 500 times, she says. The footage showed the surgery started at 12:56 p.m. when the plastic surgeon began to cut Kwon's jaw bone. Three nursing assistants were also in the room. After an hour, the plastic surgeon left, and another doctor entered the operating room. The two entered and left the room, but for almost 30 minutes, there was no doctor in the operating room at all, although nursing assistants were present.Lee saw that although the surgeon Kwon hired cut his jaw bones, he did not complete the surgery. Much of rest of the operation was done by the other doctor -- a general doctor who did not have a plastic surgery license and who had recently graduated from medical school, despite an advertisement for the clinic explicitly saying that the head doctor of the clinic would operate from start to finish. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"My brother trusted in that main doctor, and that's why he decided to be operated on there.\"Kwon Tae-hoon\n\n\n\"My brother trusted in that main doctor, and that's why he decided to be operated on there,\" Kwon Tae-hoon said.The surgery finally finished at 4:17 p.m., more than three hours after it started, according to the footage. Jaw surgery usually takes an hour-and-a-half or less for an experienced doctor, according to Kim Seon-woong, the former law director of the Korean Association of Plastic Surgeons, who has run a plastic surgery clinic for 25 years. After the surgery, both Kwon's doctors went home, leaving nurses in charge as he lost blood. Lee said she was shocked by the footage; as her son bled, assistants corrected their makeup or looked at their cellphones. In total, they mopped the bloody floor 13 times. When medical professionals evaluated the footage, they found he had likely lost three times as much blood as what the doctors had said.Lee Na Geum at her home in Seoul. She is still trying to get justice for her son Kwon Dae-hee who died in 2016.\"I don't think this ghost doctor checked how much blood my son shed,\" she added. \"I was so angry at that fact. Had just one of the three doctors checked how much he bled,\" she said, referring to the plastic surgeon, the ghost doctor and the anesthetist, \"but no one did.\" Despite Kwon's death, the clinic stayed open and continued to advertize that it had gone 14 years without a patient experiencing any accident. The clinic closed last year. It is unclear why. A lack of lawsKwon's family wanted to hold those responsible to account. But they soon found the laws around ghost doctors were weak and incomplete. South Korea's Supreme Court approved plastic surgery for aesthetic purposes as a medical practice in 1974, and the following year surgeons were required to pass professional exams. By 2014, officials were aware of the practice of ghost surgeries. In 2015, a group of plastic surgeons asked the Ministry of Health and Welfare to tighten rules by requiring doctors to say who operated on a procedure, and installing CCTV cameras in the clinics. Signs for plastic surgery clinics are displayed on the side of a building in the Sinsa-dong area of Gangnam district in Seoul, South Korea, on August 3, 2013. Civic groups began monitoring ghost surgeries, Korean broadcaster SBS reported at the time, and the Korean Plastic Surgeons Association formed a special task force team to look into the ghost doctor practice. In 2018, the law changed to raise the penalties for doctors who instruct ghost surgeries. But a paper published in 2018 in medical journal Annals of Surgical Treatment and Research found the practice was still \"rampant.\"One surgeon, who CNN agreed not to name as he feared that speaking out could prompt legal repercussions, said he began working at one of the country's largest plastic surgeries in 2012. He no longer works there, but is speaking out because he doesn't want to live with the guilt. He said he was often asked to perform surgeries for the main doctor, and described how substitutes waited in a basement until they were called to operate on patients. These people were not listed as employees on the clinic's website, and the clinic presented the surgeries as conducted by respected surgeons, he said.  Many of the face-shaping surgeries -- like the one Kwon had -- were performed by substitutes, mainly dentists, at the clinic where he worked, the surgeon said.  The plastic surgeon, who CNN has agreed not to name, says ghost doctors performed many surgeries at the clinic where he worked. Onlookers agree the practice happens for a simple reason: profit. South Korea has the highest rate of plastic surgery per capita, according to a paper last year in medical journal Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. Before Covid-19 hit, South Korea attracted thousands of plastic surgery tourists annually. In the capital alone, there are 561 plastic surgery clinics, according to the Korean Statistics Office. Jo Elfving-Hwang, an associate professor of Korean Studies at the University of Western Australia, said high-profile surgeons often use K-pop stars or celebrities to promote their clinic. But during busy periods, some can't deal with the volume of patients, especially as star doctors also need to be available for consultations with new customers, said Elfving-Hwang. \"That's where those instances have arisen,\" she said.  Ghost doctors are a way for clinics to maximize profits by getting another doctor to cover the star practitioner -- even if it's not legal. \"I guess the reason why this practice is around is because young and inexperienced doctors can get jobs and gain experience, and clinics can operate at a lower cost by hiring them to perform,\" said the unnamed plastic surgeon. \"In this way, clinics can take in more patients and conduct more surgeries.\"Not all surgeries performed by ghost doctors result in injuries, but between 2016 to 2020, 226 people were injured, had side effects, required resurgery or died during plastic surgery, according to the Korea Consumer Agency, which did not specify which proportion had died or how. Some people who have died following plastic surgery include international travelers drawn to South Korea for plastic surgery, including a Chinese customer and a Hong Kong heiress, although it's unclear if these cases are included in the statistics. Patients may not be aware they have been operated on by a ghost doctor. Ghost doctors may not note their involvement in the surgery on medical charts, and many operating rooms don't have cameras. That makes any charge difficult to prove, according to Park Ho-kyun, a lawyer representing Kwon's family. If victims are aware, they may be unwilling to come forward, as they may feel ashamed, Elfving-Hwang said. If victims do take legal cases, they often settle out of court, which means signing a confidentiality clause if they receive compensation, according to the unnamed plastic surgeon. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"Since ghost surgery or substituted surgery occurs secretly, it is very difficult to find out the statistics or the current situation.\"Health Ministry senior deputy director Park Jae-woo\n\n\nIt's unclear how many cases make it to court. But after cases are prosecuted in court, the Ministry of Health and Welfare can impose additional suspensions on doctors. A total of 28 administrative dispositions were imposed on doctors who ordered substituted surgery from 2015 to 2019, according to Ministry of Health and Welfare data provided by ruling party lawmaker Kwon Chil-seung's office. Five lost their licenses, and the rest had their licenses temporarily suspended.One doctor who asked a nurse to perform eyelid or nose plastic surgeries at least 90 times received only a three-month suspension, according to ruling party lawmaker Kwon Chil-seung's office. Another doctor who ordered a medical device company employee and a nurse to perform at least 58 surgeries on spinal disc patients got a three-month suspension, the office added. \"There are ongoing efforts by lawmakers to strengthen the qualification of doctors by revising the medical law and the Health Ministry has agreed with the proposed bills,\" Health Ministry senior deputy director Park Jae-woo told CNN this month. \"Since ghost surgery or substituted surgery occurs secretly, it is very difficult to find out the statistics or the current situation.\"\n\n\n\nLee Na Geum speaks at her home in Seoul, South Korea, about the death of her son, Kwon Dae-hee.\nDespite all that, Kwon's family was determined to seek justice. They launched a civil case against the clinic, accusing it of negligence for failing to explain the dangers of the surgery and failing to take proper measures to save its patient. In May 2019, the family won damages of $430 million Korean won ($381,000) -- based on the assumption that if Kwon had lived, he would have worked until aged 65, earning the average manual worker's income. The three doctors involved in Kwon's case are now facing criminal charges of manslaughter during the course of their work, two doctors and one nursing assistant face charges of an unlicensed medical act, and one doctor faces a charge of violating medical laws by exaggerating in an advertisement. \"Victims of medical accidents don't want to file a lawsuit in general because they know how difficult and challenging it can be,\" Kwon's mother said. \"But doctors know how hard it is to prove that something went wrong (due to a ghost doctor performing the surgery) so they openly tell victims to sue them. I heard this from many other victims I've met.\" Improving the rulesMost days, Kwon's mother stands outside South Korea's gray parliament building in Seoul. She's become a high-profile advocate for change in the industry -- she and her husband, who were retired, moved to Seoul after their son's death to fight for justice. Each day, she holds a sign demanding that authorities introduce a bill mandating CCTV in operation rooms -- a bill that's become known as the \"Kwon Dae-hee bill.\"Lee Na Geum protests in Seoul to tighten laws around plastic surgery after her son Kwon Dae-hee died following a procedure.\"I would not have been able to reveal the truth about (my son's case) without the CCTV footage,\" said his mother, Lee. She also wants doctors to have their licenses permanently revoked if they commit certain crimes, such as murder or manslaughter. There are others, too, who are working toward change, including several lawmakers who are pushing to get CCTV cameras installed in operating theaters. In 2018, Gyeonggi province became the first to fit CCTV cameras in all government-run operating rooms, but governor Lee Jae-myung wants them in all hospitals and clinics nationwide -- to prevent against ghost doctors, and stop other medical malpractice, including sexual assault under anesthetic. \"From the patient's point of view, there is almost no evidence to prove negligence by the hospital even if a lawsuit is filed,\" his office said in a statement. \"Installing CCTV in the operating room can at least prevent inappropriate actions such as substituted surgery or sexual assault.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCCTV control room screens from Gyeonggi Provincial Medical Centre Paju \n    Hospital.\n\nGyeonggi Provincial Medical Centre Ansung Hospital's operating room where a CCTV camera has been installed.\n\nCCTV control room screen from Gyeonggi Provincial Medical Centre Ansung Hospital.\n\n\nDoctors are opposed to the bills, arguing they won't be able to work as comfortably knowing they are being watched, and claiming that the cameras would erode trust with patients -- not build it. The Korean Medical Association has publicly opposed the proposed bill mandating CCTV cameras, saying it is an invasion of privacy and could lead to doctors losing concentration during surgery. But there is a groundswell of support for change. After, Kim, the former law director of the Korean Association of Plastic Surgeons, began a YouTube channel under the pseudonym Dr Vendetta exposing the issue of ghost doctors, a petition he started urging the Blue House to make changes attracted more than 50,000 signatures. A handful of young people have turned out to Kwon's court hearings to show their support for change. At the March hearing, Choi Jae-hoon, a young man in his 20s, said he had followed Kwon's case since hearing about it from Dr Vendetta's YouTube channel. \"This could be my own case, and that's why I care about this case,\" he said, explaining he was worried about medical malpractice in general medicine -- not just plastic surgery. Jeong Seoung-eun, who has been coming to court since February 2020 to support Kwon's family, said: \"I want to show my support so my country can become a better one by correcting faults in the (medical) system.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)When New Zealand's Olympic weightlifting team gathered last month for a celebratory photo shoot, one person was noticeably absent: Laurel Hubbard.The publicity-shy weightlifter is set to be the first openly transgender athlete ever to compete at the Olympics, and her inclusion has generated a fierce debate on gender, sexism and sport. To her supporters, the 43-year-old's selection is a decades-in-the-making milestone that exemplifies the Olympic spirit of inclusion and could inspire other transgender athletes who are underrepresented in sport at all levels. Hubbard's opponents -- including conservative British shock jock Piers Morgan -- argue that being a transgender woman, or a woman who was assigned male at birth, gives her an unfair physical advantage. One of Hubbard's competitors even called her inclusion \"a bad joke,\" saying it was unfair to cisgender women, whose gender identity matched their sex assigned at birth. Hubbard hasn't engaged with the firestorm, aside from in a brief statement saying she'd been \"humbled by the kindness and support\" from her countrymen. Read MoreAdvocates for greater diversity in sport say Hubbard's selection shows transgender women don't pose a threat to women's sport -- but the level of backlash against her suggests the fight for inclusion isn't over.Weightlifter Laurel Hubbard told Radio NZ in 2017: \"I'm not here to change the world.\"How the rules have evolvedKristen Worley became the first athlete to undergo an Olympic gender verification process when she tried to represent Canada in track cycling at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.Since then, she's been fighting to make sure no one has to endure the same \"humiliating\" process. In 2005, Worley -- who is an XY female -- had a physical examination in a room with four men: two sport administrators, one lawyer and one emergency doctor, Worley wrote in her book \"Women Enough.\" That followed an earlier physical examination with an endocrinologist, who asked about her sexuality.\"They viewed me as a threat to sport,\" she wrote. \"At best, I was trying to cheat; at worse, I was a freak. They felt utterly entitled to ask me embarrassing, intimate questions about the details of my surgeries, and talk openly about my body in front as me, as if I wasn't there.\"Kristen Worley hoped to compete at the Olympics in track cycling. The IOC rules -- agreed on in 2003 and known as the Stockholm consensus -- allowed transgender women and men to compete in the Olympics, as long as they had \"surgical anatomical changes\" (including having their testes or ovaries removed), obtained legal recognition of their assigned sex, and underwent hormone therapy for sufficient time to \"minimize gender-related advantages.\" But Worley said those rules had no basis in science.As Worley's testes had been removed, her body produced almost no testosterone. She applied for an exemption to allow her to take testosterone so her body could stay healthy. It took three years before she was finally given permission to take testosterone, but it was still below the level she believed she needed for her body to be healthy. Although testosterone is often associated with men, it also occurs naturally in women. It's not entirely clear how important testosterone is for women, although testosterone supplements for women can help with energy levels, said Amy K. Weimer, the medical director of University of California, Los Angeles' Gender Health Program. Although most transgender women do not take testosterone supplements after transitioning, there are some cases where it is recommended, she said. \"This area is very poorly researched and every person's experience is different,\" she said. Scared and traumatized after the years-long process, Worley quit cycling. She says she lost her career, her Olympic opportunities, her health and her wellbeing. It was five years before she could face getting back on a bike. \"When you're violated in that way ... you never forget it. You just learn how to manage it,\" she told CNN in a Zoom interview. The way her gender identity was publicly discussed destroyed her: \"It made me feel like I was less than half a human being.\"Transgender runner CeCe Telfer is ruled ineligible to compete in US Olympic trialsWorley took a case against Canadian sporting bodies and the IOC to Ontario's Human Rights Tribunal in 2015, arguing the enforcement of the 2003 Olympic policy constituted a violation of human rights. Ultimately, that case was settled in 2017, with Ontario Cycling Association and Cycling Canada committing to revising their polices. At the same time, the IOC was reviewing its own policies, and in 2015, it agreed on new guidelines removing surgical requirements. Transgender women could compete in the female category, so long as they had declared their gender identity as female for at least four years, and could demonstrate their testosterone level was below 10 nanomoles per liter for at least a year. Athletes who transitioned from female to male could compete in the male category without restriction. What the science saysJoanna Harper helped write the 2015 Olympic rules but knows there is still a lack of data on how transitioning affects athletes' sporting ability.That's something Harper, once one of Canada's top marathon runners who has competed as a transgender woman for the past 17 years, studies at Loughborough University in the United Kingdom.Harper said while trans women maintain some strength advantage over cis women, it's unclear by how much, especially for elite athletes. In a sport like weightlifting, she said, strength is key -- but agility and technique are important, too. \"Hormone therapy doesn't turn trans women into cis women -- it just doesn't,\" she said. \"The important question is, can trans women and cis women compete against one another in meaningful competition? I would think that the answer is probably yes.\"Joanna Harper helped write the 2015 Olympic rules on transgender inclusion.In Hubbard's case, she's not seen as a strong medal contender. The New Zealander is ranked 15th in the world in the super heavyweight 87 kilogram-plus category, according to the International Weightlifting Federation. Her best total is 285 kilograms -- significantly lower than top-ranked Li Wenwen's 335 kilograms. Harper published one of the first studies on transgender women in sport in 2015, which found seven of eight transgender female non-professional runners studied had significantly slower races times after transitioning. Ultimately, they performed at approximately the same level against their female peers as they had against their male peers prior to their transition.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's nonsense to think that everybody who trains can become an Olympic champion.\"Dick Swaab,Professor of neurobiology, University of Amsterdam\n\n\nTransgender athletes aren't a homogenous group, cautions Worley -- an athlete who has transitioned by having her gonads removed will have different testosterone levels from an athlete who hasn't, for instance. Similarly, a woman who transitioned before going through puberty would have virtually no advantage, said Harper. And testosterone levels aren't the whole story. Dick Swaab, a professor of neurobiology at the University of Amsterdam who has studied the brain chemistry of gender identity, said sensitivity to testosterone differs, meaning people may have a high level of testosterone but their body is not able to use it.\"The level of testosterone is only a little bit of information about the whole picture. I think the Olympic Committee hasn't even thought about sensitivity and measurements of sensitivity,\" he said. But there's a bigger question about what is a fair natural advantage.\"At the level of Olympic champions, those are exceptional people,\" Swaab added. \"It's nonsense to think that everybody who trains can become an Olympic champion.\" JUST WATCHEDTransgender pro athlete weighs in on sports inclusion controversyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTransgender pro athlete weighs in on sports inclusion controversy 06:56Some people are born with attributes that make them natural athletes, but they are not treated differently, says Jaimie Veale, president of the Professional Association for Transgender Health Aotearoa and a senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Waikato. For example, women over six feet (1.82 meters) tall might have an advantage in sport, too, but no one's saying they can't compete. \"The reality is that we don't think that way, because we don't exclude them as a group, because we actually count them as women. But really this issue comes down to who do we count as women or not,\" she said. \"When it comes down to it, it comes down to still this question of transwomen not being seen as equal citizens.\"What's at stakeThe question of how transgender women participate is bigger than just the Olympics -- it gets to the heart of what sport is about.To Australian rules football player Emily Fox, 39, who has received death threats and threatening messages about her children, the presence of transgender women in elite sport is important for visibility -- but ultimately, she sees Hubbard as an athlete who has worked hard and who deserves her place.Emily Fox (upper left) plays Australian rules football for the Williamstown Football Club in Melbourne.\"Women's sport has often been a space for women who have tried to exist outside of gender norms anyway, and particularly for same-sex attracted women, sport was often the safe space,\" she said. \"I think that (making sport more exclusive) inherently goes against what women's sport has often stood for.\"Ryan Storr, a social scientist and co-founder of Australian charity Proud2Play that encourages LGBTQ participation in sport, said the Olympics were supposed to inspire young people to participate in sport. Instead, transgender youth, who report higher rates of suicidal ideation than cisgender youth, were being discouraged from being part of it.A 2018 survey in New Zealand found trans and non-binary teenagers and adults were almost half as likely as the general population to have participated in any sports in the last month. More than half of those surveyed said they were worried about how they would be treated as a trans or non-binary athlete in competitive sport, and 58% had avoided the gym because they thought they would be mistreated. Anne Lieberman, director of policy and programs from US non-profit Athlete Ally, which aims to promote equality for LGBTQ people in sport, said that for transgender youth, having transgender athletes at the Olympics is \"nothing short of life-saving.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\"It feels like this is a dream of these young people that we can either nurture or we can shatter.\"Jaimie Veale,President, Professional Association for Transgender Health Aotearoa\n\n\n\"It shows them that they can absolutely be fully who they are and play the sport they love,\" Lieberman said. \"It shows them that their identities are real, and that they belong everywhere -- including in sports.\"Veale, from the Professional Association for Transgender Health Aotearoa, agreed: \"It feels like this is a dream of these young people that we can either nurture or we can shatter.\"What needs to changeMore than a decade after her Olympic examination, Worley says she has chosen to put the past behind her and is working with the IOC to improve the situation for other athletes.\"I've gotten to a place where I have to forgive,\" she said. \"Because by forgiving ... it takes my power back.\"In a statement to CNN, the IOC said it was developing new guidance to ensure athletes can engage in safe and fair competition, regardless of their gender identity.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's considerable tension between the notions of fairness and inclusion, and the desire and need to protect the women's category.\"IOC statement\n\n\n\"Overall, the discussions, so far, have confirmed the considerable tension between the notions of fairness and inclusion, and the desire and need to protect the women's category,\" the IOC said. Worley thinks there are still issues with the rules around transgender women participating in the Olympics -- and she doesn't think there is enough support in place, both from the organization and the public.\"I'm more concerned about (Hubbard's) health and wellbeing and to ensure her success and so on because I know the infrastructure isn't there to support her,\" she said.Hubbard declined CNN's request for an interview.  Activists argue there's also change needed at a non-elite level. Eight US states this year banned transgender girls and women in public secondary schools and colleges from participating in girls' and women's sports teams. JUST WATCHEDThe teens at the center of the fight over transgender athletes' rightsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe teens at the center of the fight over transgender athletes' rights 04:45Harper says she has been told by women that it's unfair for her to compete. \"It's hard to face that sort of animosity,\" she said. \"It hasn't really changed that much ... I would love to think that things are getting better. But I'm not sure I see a lot of evidence of that.\"Harper believes there should be a two-level approach. For athletes playing at a non-elite level, she thinks they should be allowed to compete where they feel most comfortable -- if they're at a level when blood testing doesn't regularly occur anyway, they shouldn't be blood tested. At an Olympic level, it is appropriate to have testosterone limits and blood testing for trans athletes to ensure meaningful competition -- just in the same way athletes are tested to make sure they aren't doping, she said. Storr envisions a world where sport could be made more inclusive of all genders, perhaps by organizing categories on weight or ability. After all, transgender women aren't transitioning to get an athletic advantage -- they just want to play sport in the category that fits their gender identity. As Hubbard told Radio New Zealand in 2017: \"I'm not here to change the world. I just want to be me and do what I do.\"",

But she's also been reluctant to use Japan's long-standing leave entitlement as that would have involved telling her managers, most of whom have been male, that she was menstruating.Chinese province grants women leave for menstrual pain\"It's very private and, especially in Japan, that's still kind of a taboo,\" said Mochizuki, who works in event management. \"We don't want to talk about it with any men.\" Japan's period leave entitlement has existed for more than 70 years, and the country isn't alone in Asia in having such a policy. South Korea adopted period leave in 1953. And in China and India, provinces and companies are increasingly adopting menstruation leave policies with a range of entitlements. The landscape on the other side of the world, however, looks a lot different. Period leave policy is almost nonexistent in the United States, the United Kingdom and Europe.Read MoreAnd even in countries that do have period leave, feminists are split on whether period leave is a step back or a sign of progress when it comes to women's rights. Some argue that it's as necessary for working women as maternity leave, while others say that it casts women as less able than men and could lead to further discrimination.Widely available, but rarely usedJapan introduced its period leave policy in 1947 to address labor rights concerns. For at least a decade, female factory workers had been granted period leave to give them a reprieve from harsh labor and poor sanitary conditions, while struggling with menstrual pain. After Japan's defeat in World War II, the country wrote period leave into its new labor laws as a right for all female employees whose periods are \"especially difficult.\"At first, there was a relatively high take-up \u2014 around 26% in 1965, according to local media. Estimates vary on the proportion of women globally who experience dysmenorrhea, or period pain so bad that it interferes with daily activities, but all point to it being a common condition. As time went on, fewer women took the option. A Japanese government survey in 2017 found that only 0.9% of female employees claimed period leave. In South Korea, usage is also dropping. In a 2013 survey, 23.6% of South Korean women used the leave. By 2017, that rate had fallen to 19.7%. There are a few reasons that might explain this. Although all companies in Japan have to give women period leave when they request it, they are not required to pay. And some woman may not even know that it's available to them, as companies don't typically advertise it, said Yumiko Murakami, the head of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) Tokyo Center. But the bigger issue in both South Korea and Japan is cultural. A woman browses products on a shelf in a discount store in the area of Shibuya in Tokyo, Japan, on March 1, 2013. Women already face an uphill battle in both countries, which have some of the highest gender pay gaps in the OECD and some of the lowest shares of female managers. Although it's illegal to discriminate against female employees in Japan, they often face pressure to quit once they become pregnant, Murakami said. And workers of all genders in Japan are discouraged from taking leave of any kind, Murakami added. Mochizuki remembers one colleague taking her period leave once. \"I thought, 'Why?' and, 'How can you do that, how can you tell your boss?'\" Instead, she thinks more general sick leave would work better than menstruation leave for helping women with particularly difficult periods.On top of that, periods remain a sensitive subject. When women buy tampons from the store, for example, the clerk puts them in brown paper bags, as if they are something that need to be hidden, said Murakami. \"If you tell people you're taking leave because of your period, that will be seen as you're not as good as men,\" she said.The case for period leaveIn other parts of Asia, companies aren't just using period leave to support their workers \u2014 they're also making a political statement.Indian food delivery company Zomato, for example, said when it rolled out its policy in August that it wanted to change perceptions in India where periods are shrouded in shame.  \"At Zomato, we want to foster a culture of trust, truth and acceptance,\" founder and CEO Deepinder Goyal told staff in an email, which was released publicly. \"There shouldn't be any shame or stigma attached to applying for a period leave. You should feel free to tell people on internal groups, or emails that you are on your period leave for the day.\"A biker from food delivery company Zomato in Bikaner, India. The announcement was notable in a country where women are sometimes not allowed to cook or touch anyone when they are menstruating. Girls in India typically miss 20% of the school year because of their period, and 70% of mothers consider menstruation \"dirty,\" according to a 2014 report by philanthropic organization Dasra. But Zomato's announcement was still met with backlash on social media, where critics argued that the policy could make women look weak or discourage managers from hiring female workers. Some of those opposing the move were women.According to University of Sydney professor Elizabeth Hill, who researches gender and employment, the reason period leave is so hotly contested even among feminists is because there is little data on whether period leave helps or hinders women in the workplace. Hill says many of the arguments against period leave are similar to those that have been made against maternity leave. Opponents argued that making employers pay maternity leave could discourage them from hiring women. But Hill also said there's now evidence to suggest that generous maternity leave policies encourage women to stay in the workforce rather than push them out.That's particularly important in India, which has one of the lowest female participation rates in the workforce, at 35%.\"It's a wonderful reframing of what the problem is \u2014 the problem is work, not women,\" said Deepa Narayan, a social scientist and former senior adviser at the World Bank.An Indian man looks on as he walks along a wall painting about female menstruation at the school for underprivileged children, Parijat Academy, on the Menstrual Hygiene Day in Guwahati on May 28, 2019. Guneet Monga, who produced an Academy Award-winning short documentary called \"Period. End of Sentence\" about menstruation in India, said Zomato's move seems progressive, but, even if it trickles into other workplaces, it won't make an impact to the millions of women in India not working in office jobs. \"I think that this whole concept of women's rights and equality and feminism is not a choice at the lower economic level. They just work day to day to feed. They work on an existential crisis,\" she said. \"I encourage the conversation at one level, but I do think it is a long way before we see a change.\"Why period leave hasn't taken off in the WestEvery few years, the topic of period leave hits the headlines in Western countries. Just as often, it's accompanied by scathing think pieces about why it's a bad idea.After Zomato's announcement, the Washington Post ran an opinion piece titled: \"I'm a feminist. Giving women a day off for their period is a stupid idea.\" The article argued that period leave is a \"paternalistic and silly\" proposal that \"reaffirms that there is a biological determinism to the lives of women.\"And after the Victorian Women's Trust, an Australian advocacy group for women's rights, introduced a menstruation leave policy for its staff in 2017, Brisbane newspaper The Courier-Mail ran an opinion piece with the headline: \"As a working woman in Australia I'm insulted by this crazy plan.\"Employees of Myna Mahila Foundation, an Indian charity championing menstrual hygiene, prepare sanitary pads at their office in Mumbai on April 10, 2018. Hill, the Sydney professor, said there was anecdotal evidence that younger women and men in the West tend to be more receptive to the idea, while older women are more opposed. Older women often feel that because they struggled through work while menstruating, younger women should do the same, Hill said.She noted that there were different designs for period leave \u2014 and not all policies were created equal. Some argue that there should be more personal leave entitlements for people of all genders, Hill said. Others advocate for increasing sick leave to include period leave, although critics argue that women aren't sick when they have their period \u2014 they are just experiencing a normal, biological process. Evidence suggests there is some desire \u2014 and need \u2014 for period leave in the West.  A survey of 32,748 Dutch women published in the British Medical Journal last year found that 14% had taken time off from work or school during their period. Even when they called in sick due to their period, only 20% gave the real reason. Around 68% said they wished they had the option of more flexible work or study hours during their period. But most \u2014 just under 81% \u2014 turned up to work anyway, even though they felt less productive as a result of their symptoms. Lost productivity amounted to almost nine days a year, according to the study.India has an unlikely new type of period health educators: menAt the Victorian Women's Trust, executive director Mary Crooks said the benefits of period leave have been \"absolutely palpable\" for her office which has 13 female staff members.\"You shouldn't have to be dishonest about why you can't come to work, and why you can't perform productively at work,\" she said, adding that the reproductive cycle was crucial to women's physical and mental health. The trust's policy gives women options: a comfortable spot to work in the office, permission to work from home or to take up to 12 paid days of menstrual leave each year. In the four years since it was introduced, staff have only taken 21 paid period leave days between them, Crooks said. The culture has become more supportive and staff feel more comfortable discussing their menstrual needs and care for themselves better, she said. Because employees feel respected by their company, they also work more productively, Crooks added.\"I think there's nothing but positives that have come about in our workplace as a result of it,\" she said. \"To us, the removal of shame and stigma is one of the great big jigsaw pieces in the gender equality picture.\"That's certainly the case in Japan, where stigma still exists. Part of the reason women aren't taking period leave, according to the OECD's Murakami, is that the culture around leave and menstruation makes women fear that taking it could lead to discrimination by their employers. \"I do think the law itself is actually meant to help women, but if it's not implemented well it could hurt women,\" she said.

        "content": "(CNN)On a brightly lit stage, two male K-pop stars with glowing skin and perfectly coiffed hair are nibbling either end of the same long, chocolate stick. As the stick gets smaller and smaller, they get closer and closer -- and eventually a fellow K-pop idol pulls them into a kiss. In South Korea's glitzy, highly manufactured music industry, these kinds of scenes are not uncommon. As long as it's only for show, that is.Homophobia is still rife in South Korea, where very few mainstream music stars have come out as gay. The country has no comprehensive anti-discrimination laws to protect LGBTQ South Koreans, and compared to nearby democracies like Japan and Taiwan, the country is less accepting of same-sex couples.A still from K-pop star Holland's 2018 music video \"Neverland.\" Taiwan has introduced same-sex marriage -- and although Japan hasn't done the same, some cities issue same-sex partnership certificates, though they're not legally binding.Read MoreThere's no such option in South Korea. There, homosexual sex is not banned, but it is illegal in the military, where almost all men must complete a stint of compulsory conscription.Despite all that, same-sex K-pop idols regularly play-act romance. On stage, they dance intimately with one another or gaze into each other's eyes. In video clips, it's not uncommon to see them playing games that result in them grazing lips, then dramatically recoiling to show that it was all just play.That apparent contradiction is no accident. If you come out, your fans will be so infuriated.Jungmin Kwon, authorAlthough major labels are afraid to let stars be open about their sexuality for fear that they will hurt their career, they allow -- and sometimes encourage -- stars to touch each other in public.\"It's kind of sad,\" said Jungmin Kwon, an academic who wrote a book called \"Straight Korean Female Fans and Their Gay Fantasies.\"\"On the one hand it looks like the industry is very open minded to shipping culture,\" she told CNN, referring to the culture among fans of imagining relationships between their favorite stars -- including gay relationships. \"On the other hand, they're not that much ... If you come out, your fans will be so infuriated.\" Fantasy worldsTo understand what's going on, you need to go back to the 1990s. For decades, South Korea had been under military rule. It wasn't until 1993 that the country's first elected civilian president took office, ushering in a new era of economic growth, technological development, and a blossoming entertainment sector -- including the first K-pop idols.Teenagers were hungry to consume everything about their favorite stars. But it was a time before social media, and stars didn't share as much about their lives as they do now.Seoul's burgeoning drag scene confronts conservative attitudes So fans got creative. According to Kwon, fans were inspired by \"yaoi\" -- a kind of Japanese manga that features gay relationships between male couples -- and began making up stories about their favorite stars. But rather than drawing pictures, as was done in Japanese yaoi culture, they wrote stories so they could easily be uploaded and shared using dial-up internet. The stories often featured romance between same-sex stars. Kwon said there are several reasons that was the case. Fans often didn't think they were worthy of their idols themselves, so they matched them with stars from the same band -- and most bands were exclusively girl or boy groups. Same sex relationships were often seen as taboo, which made them more \"intriguing,\" said Kwon. \"It was easier to find stuff with the members together (compared) with people of the opposite sex,\" said 22-year-old Amber Chuah, who was into fanfiction when she was younger. \"It's world-building without the extra step of having to create the specific character and their traits.\"As internet downloads ate into record sales in the 2000s, South Korea's record labels realized they couldn't just focus on the music -- they needed to package stars in a way that would appeal to fans.BTS' army of admirers: Inside one of the world's most powerful fandomsWith much of the fanfiction about same-sex romance, one of the country's largest entertainment company, SM Entertainment, began encouraging its stars to take part in \"skinship\" -- or touching a fellow band member, according to Kwon. It was a different approach from the West, where bands like One Direction have strenuously denied fan theories of in-band romance. Even now, K-pop labels sometimes cultivate idols' homoerotic appeal in the hopes that it makes them more popular in fanfiction, where Kwon estimates 80% of stories involve gay story lines. That, in turn, can increase their profile -- and translate into economic benefits. \"K-pop idols know that it comes with the territory, and the more fans are involved in many, many different ways in the fandom, the better it is for them as performers and as celebrities,\" said Michelle Cho, a professor of East Asian Studies at the University of Toronto.An openly gay starSouth Korea's record labels are happy to let fans fantasize about idols being gay. But they don't want gay idols be open about their sexuality.That was something 23-year-old star Holland found out firsthand. Holland -- whose real name is Go Tae-seob -- went through rigorous training with one of the labels (he declined to say which one). But when it came time to debut, the label was against him debuting as a gay idol.         View this post on Instagram           hi wendy \ud83e\udda2\ud83d\udc7c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc1a\ud83d\udd4a\ud83e\udd5a\ud83c\udf7c A post shared by  HOLLAND (@holland_vvv) on Dec 16, 2019 at 2:25pm PST\n\"They said it would be bad for my image,\" Holland told CNN. To Holland, that was a deal-breaker. He had been badly bullied in middle school, and it was important to him to be open about his sexuality. So he quit the label and debuted as an independent artist.\"I wanted to prove that I am worthy of love, and that I'm worthy of achieving and being accomplished,\" he said. \"I felt that was the only way I could love myself.\"K-pop stars are often subject to strict rules -- many are not allowed to date publicly, as labels worry that any relationships make stars lose their mystique among fans. For the major labels, public same-sex relationships appear to be out of the question.Against that backdrop, Holland was a major break with tradition.When he debuted in 2018, he attracted a lot of positive attention overseas. But back home in South Korea, the reaction was muted -- or even negative. Nevertheless, Holland remained determined to make a statement. While filming the music video for his first single \"Neverland,\" the director told him that there would be a 19+ rating in South Korea if the clip showed any same-sex affection. So Holland decided to include a scene where he kisses a man to prompt audiences to consider why a same-sex kiss deserved an explicit rating when a kiss between a man and a woman wouldn't.  He finds it sad when shows make stars kiss each other. \"They make it into funny content to embarrass them,\" Holland said. \"It's a shame that's the limit they can go when it comes to showing homosexual interaction -- it can only be portrayed as funny.\"Are things changing?In South Korea, Holland's decision to come out is unusual. To many celebrities, the case of television personality Hong Seok-cheon still looms large.After Hong came out publicly as gay in 2000, he was fired from his hosting job and lost other work -- and author Kwon believes that harsh response has discouraged others from following suit. Timothy Rich, an associate professor at the Political Science Department of Western Kentucky University, said that any company or celebrity would be worried about the potential backlash and financial risk if a star came out.Why the past decade saw the rise and rise of East Asian pop culture \"In the current climate, I suspect there would be considerable conservative backlash to any star that came out, possibly resulting in boycotts,\" he told CNN.But there are reasons to think things could change.As K-pop's international reach grows, K-pop itself is changing. In South Korea, interaction between stars is seen through a different lens -- fans see it as fantasy, and there's also more of a culture of male friends touching each other, in part because of how heteronormative the culture is. But internationally, K-pop fans see close interactions between stars as evidence of genuine relationships, and are often keen to have these confirmed so that they have stars that represent them.Sunmi at an exhibition on September 18, 2019 in Milan, Italy. A star like Holland wouldn't have been able to exist at all if it weren't for the globalization of K-pop, said Cho, from the University of Toronto. Holland thinks things are changing: more artists appear to be indicating that they are allies of the gay community.Last year, K-pop singer Sunmi made headlines when she told concertgoers that she was an \"LGBT queen,\" although she later clarified that she only meant she supported the community -- not that she identified as LGBT herself. Gay and trans soldiers say they were abused in South Korean militaryBoyband BTS is often seen as sympathetic to LGBTQ rights, although their statements in support are often vague. In the absence of confirmation, commentators have used small, inclusive clues to speculate on their stance, for example, the time the band's leader RM tweeted Macklemore's song \"Same Love,\" which promotes equal rights for gay people.The same-sex themes in fanfiction could help change people's perspective, said Cho. Holland agreed: \"It's a start for them to naturally accept different sexualities.\"  But ultimately, experts believe a time when gay stars are accepted in mainstream K-pop could still be some way off.\"Idol culture is pretty conservative,\" Cho said. \"It's quite difficult for performers unless they reach celebrity status with the autonomy that brings ... For anyone else to rock the boat is pretty difficult.\"",

        "content": "Beijing (CNN)All Shi Muying wanted was to spend one last Lunar New Year holiday with her terminally ill mother.She flew back from the United Kingdom, where she lives and works, to spend the festive season in her hometown, Wuhan, a sprawling metropolis in central China. For 24 hours a day, Shi -- who is in her mid-30s -- sat by her mother's bedside in hospital, taking care of her.Around her, more and more people were getting sick from a newly identified coronavirus. But Shi wasn't too worried.After all, Chinese authorities were saying that the outbreak was \"preventable and controllable.\" Now, three weeks after Shi arrived in China, it's clear the outbreak is not under control. The virus has spread to every Chinese province and region, across Asia and as far away as Europe and the United States. It has infected more than 9,800 people and killed over 200. Wuhan has been placed on an effective lockdown, almost entirely sealed off from the outside world. Read MoreOn Monday, preliminary results showed Shi could also be infected with the virus.A suspected patient of coronavirus  at a community health station in Wuhan, China.But she is more worried for her family -- for her 67-year-old father who also appears to have the virus, and for her mother who has been uprooted to what she describes as an older, inferior hospital building, to make way for the rush of coronavirus patients.   Shi, and others like her, have become victims of a public health care crisis. Over the past few days, CNN has spoken to patients, medical staff and experts who have told of delays in testing for the virus, in telling the public the true nature of the virus' spread, and of an already overburdened health system creaking under the enormous weight of a rapidly expanding outbreak.The start of an outbreakWhen Shi arrived in China on January 10, the coronavirus outbreak was already well underway.By then, a few dozen people in Wuhan had presented with a mysterious virus that seemed similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a coronavirus that originated in southern China in November 2002, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing 774 worldwide. On January 7, Chinese scientists identified the pathogen as a novel coronavirus. Two days later, the first death occurred.     But it wasn't until over a week later, Shi says, that a doctor pulled her aside. The situation wasn't good, the doctor said, and everyone needed to wear a face mask.\"I saw this doctor going to patients' families one by one, privately,\" Shi said. \"It was only then when we realized how serious this was getting.\"On January 17, there were 41 confirmed cases in Wuhan. By January 20, the total number of confirmed cases jumped to 201 across China, with three dead. While the virus was discussed widely online over that period, it didn't make the front page of official state newspaper, the People's Daily, until January 21. Chinese authorities traced the virus back to a now-shuttered market in Wuhan that sold a number of wild animals. On January 3, the city's health authorities said there was no obvious sign of human-to-human transmission, and no medical staff had been infected. Less than three weeks later, it was a different story.On January 20, Chinese-appointed expert Zhong Nanshan said there was evidence of the virus being transmitted between humans. Wuhan's mayor Zhou Xianwang later acknowledged that information on the virus wasn't communicated well. Under Chinese law, local governments need to report an epidemic outbreak with unknown causes to the national health department and get approval from the State Council before they can make an announcement. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline\n\n\n\n\n2019\n\n\n\nDecember 8: First patient develops symptoms of Wuhan coronavirus\nDecember 31: Earliest cases of virus reported to World Health Organization\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\nJanuary 1: Market in Wuhan where outbreak is believed to have originated closed for disinfection\nJanuary 7: Chinese scientists identify pathogen involved as new strain of coronavirus\nJanuary 9: First death linked to virus\nJanuary 20: Cases reported in Beijing and Shenzhen\nJanuary 23: First virus outside Wuhan\nTravel restrictions placed on Wuhan's neighboring cities, impacting millions of people \nWHO says virus is not yet a public health emergency of international concernJanuary 28: Death toll tops 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, CNN reporting\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Mary Gallagher, the director of the Center for Chinese studies at the University of Michigan and an expert in Chinese politics, believes that the numbers of infections was likely under-reported by Wuhan authorities in December and the start of January.  \"It's not even necessarily an insidious command from the central government -- it's almost like an implicit norm, that bad news is to be covered up as much as possible,\" she said. Chinese President Xi Jinping said Tuesday that the government was releasing information in a \"transparent and responsible manner.\"\"The Chinese people are engaging in a serious battle against the outbreak of the new coronavirus pneumonia. People's lives and health are always the first priority for the Chinese government, and the prevention and control of the epidemic is the most important task at present, so I have been directing and deploying the works myself.\"Around the same time as the jump in cases, two men in full hazmat suits barged into Shi's mother's ward, demanding they move to another floor within 30 minutes. \"They gave no reasoning, just the order,\" Shi said. \"It was only when I asked the hospital staff, and they told me that all patients on this floor -- like my mum, they are all cancer patients -- must be evacuated to make space for handling novel coronavirus.\"A few days later, the whole city went into an almost total lockdown.  But by that point, it was likely already too late to contain the virus, Guan Yi, a leading virologist, told Caixin. According to Wuhan authorities, 5 million people left the city due to Lunar New Year and the outbreak. As of January 27, there were still more than 4,000 Wuhan residents overseas. Slow testing The truth about the virus also came too late for other patients in Wuhan's hospitals.By January 26, Shi began to have a fever -- one of the symptoms of the novel coronavirus. She went to the hospital's fever clinic where she found over 20 patients, all waiting to be tested by one doctor.A member of the medical staff at the Wuhan Red Cross Hospital in Wuhan on January 25.She says she was given three tests -- a nasal swipe to rule out the flu, a CT scan to compare her lungs against those of infected patients, and a blood test. After nine hours of tests and waiting for results she says the doctor told her that she had coronavirus, but because he could not give her the fourth and most definitive test, she could only be considered a suspected patient. Her 67-year-old father is in the same situation.Shi called hospitals all over Wuhan, trying in vain to find one with the confirmation test -- a reagent test which chemically tests for the virus.For now, Shi and her father are not counted in the official statistics of people infected.John Nicholls, a professor in pathology at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), said it was no surprise that Shi could have caught the virus in hospital. He points out viruses can easily spread within a hospital if doctors don't take proper precautions.Others, like Shi, have experienced delays in tests or have struggled to get tested at all.Medical staff with a patient at the Wuhan Red Cross Hospital in Wuhan.One Wuhan resident who asked to be referred to as Leya as she fears government reprisals for speaking out said she and her young son have spent days waiting to hear if they have coronavirus. They have had a CT scan and a nucleic acid test -- a laboratory examination to identify a virus. They still haven't got confirmation of coronavirus -- and until they do, they cannot be admitted to hospital. Her husband, his parents and her parents are already in hospital with the virus, and she is convinced that she and her son are likely to have the virus, too.\"I think I might have been infected,\" Leya said fearfully. \"I don't know, everyday I'm getting pains around my heart.\" I think I might have been infected ... I don't know, everyday I'm getting pains around my heartLeya, Wuhan residentDora Jiang's 72-year-old uncle -- who is based in Wuhan -- is in a similar position. He went to a dedicated coronavirus hospital, but he says they delayed testing him for days and would not admit him until he receives a formal diagnosis, said Jiang, who spoke with CNN from her home in Germany.These reports of test delays come amid assurances from Chinese manufacturer Shanghai ZJ Bio-Tech that it can produce enough testing kits to meet nationwide demand. According to state media reports on Monday, the company said it can produce 8,000 boxes per day and has enough raw materials in stock to make testing kits for 2 million people.On Tuesday evening, Wuhan's Communist Party chief Ma Guoqiang acknowledged that before mid-January, samples had to be sent to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) in Beijing. From mid-January, Wuhan was able to test about 300 cases a day, he said. China CDC says it is using a test known as fluorescent RT-PCR to detect the virus, which can be done via a nasal swab, blood, urine, or a serum specimen. A Chinese man wears a protective mask as he stands in a nearly empty street in Beijing on January 26. HKU's Nicholls said that the PCR rapid test could be done in a couple of hours. He said the nasal swab was worthwhile to exclude ordinary flu, but he thought both a chest X-ray and blood tests to check for an increase in inflammatory cells would be a waste of resources.The delays in testing can mean patients miss out on treatment but may also mean the scale of the problem is worse than we know.As Gallagher from the University of Michigan puts it: \"I don't think the numbers that are coming out now are inaccurate because of deliberate under-reporting, I think they may be under-reported because of a lack of capacity to test.\" 'I feel so powerless'It's not just testing kits that places like Wuhan are short of. Authorities there have asked for more supplies, and announced they would build two new hospitals in a week to increase the city's capacity to fight the outbreak.Right now, loads of medical staff are at breaking point ... I see my sisters charging toward the front line and I feel so powerless.A nurse in WuhanAccording to a nurse in Wuhan who asked not to be identified for fear of professional repercussions, staff are overwhelmed, resources are running low, and there are no beds. There are so few hazmat suits that staff disinfect them at the end of their shift to wear again the next day, she said. Around 30 of the 500 medical staff at her hospital are now sick and admitted to hospital, and others -- including her -- have self-quarantined at home.\"There really are a lot of people who can't get admitted, but there's no point in blaming the nurses. There are no beds, no resources. Are we supposed to just fight this battle bare-handed?\" she said. \"Right now, loads of medical staff are at breaking point ... I see my sisters charging toward the front line and I feel so powerless.\"Medical staff in Wuhan on January 26.Similar things are happening in other Wuhan hospitals. On Sunday, a nurse from Wuhan Central Hospital told CNN that at least a dozen medical staff had been infected with coronavirus. One doctor at one of Wuhan's maternity hospitals, who spoke with CNN on condition of anonymity, said hospital staff are encouraging those with minor symptoms to stay at home and self-quarantine.\"If you have a fever, don't come to the hospital,\" she posted on WeChat, a Chinese social media platform. Unless someone is suffering from serious conditions, she believes they should stay away from hospitals as they risk infecting others and causing unnecessary strain on the health system.System under pressureEven before the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, China's health care system was under pressure, says Chen Xi, an assistant professor at Yale School of Public Health.After the SARS outbreak in 2003, the Chinese government poured huge amounts of money into building hospitals, he said. When the government started trying to develop its primary health care sector -- the equivalent of general practitioners -- it was too late: there was already a growing population and a culture of going to hospital for any health issue, including minor ailments, as people thought the hospitals were more trustworthy.Medical staff at the Wuhan Red Cross Hospital on January 25.There is still a large divide between the care provided at urban hospitals in the most developed cities -- like Wuhan -- and the care in rural hospitals, Chen said.    People in rural areas often travel huge distances to access better care, leading to even more overcrowding at urban hospitals. Particularly at this time of year, hospitals in places like Wuhan would already be extremely busy because it's flu season, Chen added. According to University of Michigan's Gallagher, there is also a lack of health care professionals, in part because of a fear that becoming a doctor or nurse puts them at risk of violence. Last month, a Beijing doctor was fatally stabbed by a patient's relative. The problem is so widespread that China has passed a new law -- which comes into effect later this year -- to protect medical workers. Wuhan may be struggling, but as a major city, its hospitals are relatively good compared to others in China, said Gallagher.It's plausible that the situation could be even worse in smaller centers where there is lower quality of care. Around 46 million people live in the 14 cities other than Wuhan under travel restrictions in Hubei province, and all those places have less developed health services than the provincial capital. A Chinese man at a large empty shopping area in Beijing on January 28.Many of those people might have otherwise traveled to Wuhan for care -- but now, they will have to stay put. In WeChat groups seen by CNN, there are already discussions over regional hospitals lacking supplies.Health care inequality could also be a problem for China's migrant workers, who have returned home over the Lunar New Year period, Gallagher said. They may be unable to afford health care in the urban center where they work, but health care services could be inadequate in the rural area they are from.\n\n\n\n For now, there is little people like Shi can do.Shi and her father self-quarantined themselves at home this week, and were too afraid to visit Shi's mother lest they infect others.\"My dad really wants to go and visit mum, but we both seem to have got the virus. We can't go. Our hearts are extremely conflicted,\" she said. \"I am less worried about myself -- I'm more worried for my father, because it seems that the elderly are more vulnerable to this disease. I just hope that a hospital can take him in first.\"Shi's father was admitted to hospital Thursday, but Shi is still at home. Earlier this week, a hospital worker told Shi that they don't have space for her and her father. When Shi asked what kind of patient would be admitted, she says the staff member responded: \"We will admit (them) if they're dying.\"CNN's Julia Hollingsworth wrote and reported from Hong Kong.

        "content": "(CNN)It was pitched as a rare repatriation flight to bring people stranded in China back to their Pacific Island home which has yet to report a single coronavirus case. But of the 104 people on board the chartered Solomon Airlines flight from the southern Chinese city Guangzhou on September 3, only 21 were from the Solomon Islands.The rest were Chinese nationals, according to a report by Radio New Zealand which cited the passenger list.In the days before the flight landed in the country's humid capital, Honiara, local politicians and non-governmental bodies urged the Solomon Islands' Prime Minister to call it off. Despite China reporting just a handful of new coronavirus cases each day for the past few months, to some, the risk was too great. The Solomon Islands' borders have been almost entirely sealed for months. This flight, they worried, could bring the first reported case of Covid-19 into the country of almost 700,000, and wreak devastation on its poor health system. Read MoreBut the government didn't listen.     For Daniel Suidani, the premier of the country's most populous province, Malaita, the nation's leaders were putting their new relationship with Beijing before their own people. The Solomon Islands swapped allegiances with the democratic self-governed island of Taiwan for communist Beijing last year. Beijing considers Taiwan part of China, and refuses to have diplomatic relations with any nation that doesn't recognize its \"One China Policy.\" Two days before the Honiara flight was due to land, Suidani announced an independence referendum for Malaita.\"Our conviction is that the ... administration has become so obliged and indebted to China that it can no longer provide essential services to protect its citizens' public health,\" he said in a statement emailed to CNN. \"It is time for Malaita people to see whether they are still willing to be part of a country (whose) leadership is becoming dictatorial.\"CNN reached out to the Solomon Islands' central government for comment on the allegation that they are no longer looking after their people, but received no response.  Traditional dances performed in Malaita in 1981. While longtime Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare welcomes China and the economic benefits it promises, some fear that Beijing is too powerful to be an equal partner for the Solomon Islands. The Solomon Islands has reportedly considered leasing an entire island to China and debated offering investment-for-citizenship deals to mainland Chinese.China's foreign ministry told CNN that the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Solomon Islands had been \"open and fair.\" \"Any rumors and slanders cannot affect the development of friendly relations between China and the Solomon Islands,\" the spokesperson said.The switch and the stadiumIn the Solomon Islands' verdant capital, Honiara, there's a stretch of land with scars of the famous Battle of Guadalcanal, a World War II campaign that was the Allied forces' first decisive victory in the Pacific theater. Now, some of that land has been earmarked for a new stadium bankrolled by China -- and it has become the symbol of a new type of battleground.   After the Solomon Islands won the right to host the 2023 Pacific Games -- the region's answer to the Olympics -- the country was in need of a venue to host athletic events. In July 2019, the Solomon Islands' diplomatic ally of more than three decades, Taiwan, agreed to help out with a loan.      Months later, in September 2019, the Solomon Islands ditched its diplomatic ties with Taiwan for Beijing, throwing the future of the stadium into jeopardy.The Solomon Islands had recognized Taiwan since 1983. In the years since, Taipei poured millions of dollars into the Solomon Islands, including in development projects such as a hospital, according to a paper by Clive Moore, a professor at the University of Queensland who specializes in the Solomon Islands. Taiwan also poured money into a slush fund for Solomon Islands politicians, Moore said.The Solomon Islands had stayed loyal even as China's checkbook diplomacy in the strategically important region prompted Pacific neighbors to switch allegiances. To Taiwan, every diplomatic partner counts, no matter how small. It now has only 15 official allies, and all four of its remaining Pacific allies have smaller populations than the province of Malaita. That meant keeping the Solomons as a partner was a big deal. But by 2019, the lure of a more economically beneficial relationship with China became too great. Jian Zhang, an expert in Asian security affairs at the Australian Defence Force Academy, told CNN that economic considerations \u200bwere the key factor in the Solomon Islands' decision. That was clear in Sogavare's statement following the switch: \"Our nation of Solomon Islands is bound to reap huge benefits never seen before in the history of our young nation, in this new relationship with PRC,\" he said.For years, China had been the country's largest trade partner, importing annually millions of dollars of rough wood -- the country's biggest export -- according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC). Some Chinese construction companies started projects in the Solomon Islands, including a 96-meter-long concrete bridge in 2018, according to state media Xinhua. Now, China was reportedly promising that the relationship could be worth even more. The amount of financial support China promised to the Solomon Islands prior to the switch hasn't been made public, however, in a Radio Taiwan International report, Taiwanese Foreign Minister Wu Zhaoxie was quoted as saying that in his understanding, China had promised around $500 million. It is not clear what form that that support would take.CNN reached out to China's foreign ministry and the Solomon Islands central government for comment. The Solomon Islands government did not respond. Manasseh Sogavare speaks at a press conference inside the Parliament House in Honiara, Solomons Islands on April 24, 2019. If that $500 million figure is correct, it would be more than Taiwan's contribution in the last decade. According to Australia-based think tank, the Lowy Institute, Taiwan spent between  $11 million and $22 million in official development assistance grants -- the \"gold standard\" in foreign aid -- in the Solomon Islands each year between 2011 and 2017. China spent $39,000 in grants in the Solomon Islands over the same period, according to Lowy data.But it did offer trade. In 2018, 67% of the Solomon Islands' $869 million in exports went to China -- only 3% was bought by Taiwan, according to the OEC.So the decision by one of the poorest countries in the Pacific to switch was perhaps unsurprising.\"To be honest, when it comes to economics and politics, Taiwan is completely useless to us,\" Prime Minister Sogavare said, in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation \u200bahead of the change in political allegiance.Chinese President Xi Jinping meets with Solomon Islands' Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, on October 9, 2019. After the move, Taiwan's Ambassador to Palau said Taiwan's \"heart was broken,\" Radio New Zealand reported. Mike Pence, the vice president of the United States, reportedly canceled plans to meet the \u200bSolomon Islands' Prime Minister \u200blast September. The US has not had formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan in more than 40 years, but it remains a key strategic ally.The switch also left the future of the Solomon Islands' 10,000-seat stadium in jeopardy -- but not for long. In October 2019, a month after the Solomon Islands agreed to switch allegiances, Beijing promised the Solomon Islands 74 million Australian dollars ($54 million) for the stadium.  It wasn't a loan -- it was a gift.China opened an embassy on a tiny, remote Pacific island during the pandemic. Here's whyIn the months since, reports from local media suggest that limited progress has been made on the stadium. The Solomon Islands closed its borders to foreigners in March, and since then only around 800 citizens and a few dozen foreign essential workers have entered the country, according to a government statement. So when the government approved the flight in August, full of Chinese workers on the stadium project, some believed the government was prioritizing the stadium over the people. Li Ming, the first Chinese ambassador to the Solomon Islands, was also on board for his inaugural trip in the position. Although the \u200bgovernment of the Solomon Islands said passengers all tested negative before boarding the flight, many in the Solomon Islands were shocked by the decision to let a high volume of Chinese nationals into the country when borders were meant to be closed.\"We are risking the entire nation,\" said non-governmental organization Transparency Solomon Islands. \"It seems the executive government is not listening anymore to the calls made by the citizens of this country.\"\"The expectation is that entry of the pandemic would be a disaster,\" Joseph Foukona, an assistant professor at the University of Hawaii who hails from Malaita, said on September 3, as he explained why the flight was so unpopular.Fears in MalaitaIn the days ahead of the flight landing, some in Malaita feared that the province's Chinese community -- who make up less than 1% of the population of Malaita's 160,000-strong population, according the 2009 Census, the most recent available data -- would travel to the capital to welcome the new ambassador off the plane, and then return to the province bringing Covid-19 with them, Foukona said.  That prompted the Malaita for Democracy (M4D) activist group to issue a letter telling all Chinese people to leave the provincial capital, Auki, within 24 hours, according to local media reports. And this wasn't the first time that the Solomon Islands' long-standing Chinese community of a few thousand people had faced local hostility. In 2006, there were riots in Honiara's Chinatown over the growing presence of Chinese business people, whose families mostly came to the Solomon Islands to work before the country gained independence from Britain in 1978.Australian soldiers patrol through Honiara's Chinatown in the Solomon Islands on April 22, 2006. All of Chinatown has been locked down as a crime scene.In that instance, Beijing had to charter a flight to evacuate hundreds of Chinese nationals.These days, there are multiple private and state-owned Chinese companies in the Solomon Islands, according to Chinese Communist Party-controlled media Global Times. That has led to a sense among some Solomon Islanders that Chinese people had already taken over. \"A current joke is that people lament the decline of Honiara's quaint Chinatown, which is no longer central, but then others say it does not matter as the whole of Honiara is a Chinatown now,\" said Moore. A mother and child board their flight as they are flown out of the  Solomon Islands on chartered aircraft provided by Beijing after losing all their possessions in the recent riots in Honiara, 23 April 2006.  Ahead of the flight, police patrolled the streets of Auki to maintain calm, according to local media. On September 1, before the flight landed, Suidani sent a statement to media in a Word document without any official letterhead, announcing that his province, a collection of islands with a population the size of Salt Lake City, would hold an independence referendum this month. CNN confirmed the authenticity of the letter. He pointed to the continued pressure from the \"intimidating\" central government to allow the Chinese Communist Party into the province. \"No one should think that they have any monopoly powers to exert their bad decisions on us,\" he said.Locals search through the remains of smouldering buildings in Chinatown on April 21, 2006 following several days of rioting and looting in the Soloman Islands' capital, Honiara.In an interview with CNN, Suidani said the central government's sole responsibility was to take care of its people. \"But what I've seen of the Solomon Islands government, this government doesn't look after us.\"\"We are just wondering whether the government is caring about people's lives or thinking of the stadium, because we have seen that the government hasn't heard the cries of the people,\" Suidani said. Already, there has been a suspected quarantine breach. Last Tuesday, Solomon Island police said they were investigating an incident where a Chinese national in quarantine in Honiara passed a package to someone outside the facility. When CNN asked if China was concerned for its Solomon Islands-based citizens, the country's foreign affairs ministry said it believed the Solomon government has the capability to deal with its own affairs.Calls for independenceWhen Suidani made a call for an independence referendum, it wasn't entirely out of the blue. Although the Solomon Islands is small -- only around 36 times the land area of New York City -- it's home to more than 63 different local languages and a vast array of cultures, forced into one country by the British colonizers who first established a protectorate in the Solomon Islands in 1893.The Queen And Prince Philip arriving in Honiara on the Royal Barge on October 18, 1982. Those divisions have often \u200bbeen the fault lines of conflicts.In 1998, rebels on \u200bGuadalcanal island tried to overthrow the country's then Malaitan ruler. That sparked years of ethnic tensions costing 200 lives, according to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and prompting concern in the region that the Solomon Islands could become a failed state. Countries such as Australia and New Zealand sent in troops to stabilize the situation, and an Australia-led peace-keeping mission lasted until 2017.  In Malaita, an independence movement has simmered for decades, due to long-standing feelings of marginalization from the central government, said Graeme Smith, an expert in China's investment in the Pacific at Australian National University.In the months before the charter flight, there had been signs of disagreement between the central government and Malaita, according to Foukona. CNN made multiple requests for comment from Sogavare's government, but received no reply. Last year, Suidani was one of the outspoken critics of rescinding official recognition of Taiwan, furthering tensions with the central government. Queen Elizabeth II visiting the Solomon Isles in 1982. He was worried about Chinese businesspeople coming into the country and taking ownership of businesses and land away from local people -- already, he tells CNN, he has seen Chinese people in the logging industry coming to Malaita and not respecting the local rules. \"I believe in getting this illegal development out of Malaita,\" Suidani said. CNN reached out to China's foreign affairs for comment on the practices of Chinese in the logging industry and was told that the Chinese government \"requires Chinese companies to abide by local laws and international rules.\"Suidani is also concerned that close relations with China's Communist Party could impact democracy and freedom of religion in the Solomon Islands, a strongly Christian country. In Fiji, a Pacific Island country which is aligned with China, there are already concerns about the way its diplomatic partner is limiting freedom of speech there. As coronavirus spread in other countries, Suidani went his own way, and reached out to Taiwan for humanitarian aid in a bid to help the province prepare for a potential outbreak.. Taipei delivered a 50-ton  shipment of rice in June, according to Radio New Zealand. But when Suidani thanked Taipei, he was reprimanded by the central government for calling Taiwan a country.A pile of clothes on the ground at a small Chinese makeshift refugee camp in Honiara on April 21, 2006,   after almost 90 percent of Chinatown was burnt down during rioting.\"Such divisive statement from a provincial premier threatens the unity of the country at a time when we need to work together in keeping Covid-19 from entering our borders and not politicize the virus,\" Solomon Islands' Foreign Minister Jeremiah Manele said. Taiwan sent Malaita a shipment of medical supplies in June, but it was intercepted in the country's capital Honiara and investigated by police. In August, it was still being held, according to Taiwanese authorities, although it has since been released, Suidani said. That, too, exacerbated tensions between the province and the government.What all this meansIn the aftermath of Suidani's calls for a referendum, tensions have only ramped up in the small country. Although a spokesperson for Sogavare told CNN \"you will be copied-in if/when the PM makes a formal response to this story,\" the government has since put out statements calling Suidani's announced referendum \"illegal,\" and saying that no provincial government has any business making a stand on foreign relations. Why China is challenging Australia for influence over the Pacific IslandsBack in Malaita, protests have broken out in the capital Auki after the provincial secretary was recalled to Honiara. \"This call was made because of the effectiveness of (the provincial secretary) in stopping illegal logging operations exporting logs to China,\" the Malaita Provincial Government said in a statement.\"When government ignores the law, we are moving into the area of dictatorship. Solomon Islands is slipping into the direction of the one-party system of China as we have been warning all along.\"For now, it's unclear whether the vote can even go ahead. Solomon Islands' Ministry of Provincial Government Institutional and Strengthening says that Suidani doesn't have the legal authority to hold a referendum, and the Minister of Provincial Government Institutional and Strengthening can suspend any expenditure if he doesn't believe it's in the public interest.Even if Malaita's independence vote doesn't go ahead, it's clear that the diplomatic rivalry between China and Taiwan has inflamed political instability in the country, Jian Zhang, an expert in Asian security affairs at the Australian Defence Force Academy, told CNN.Both Taiwan and China have a history of engaging with subnational players, although there has been no suggestion from political players that Taipei has influenced the call for an independence referendum. Zhang says it's possible that Taiwan's relationship with Malaita could eventually see the Solomon Islands switch allegiances again -- or, in the unlikely event that Malaita becomes an independent country, it could become Taiwan's new diplomatic partner. Reinforcements of Australian Army personnel arrive at Honiara Airport during police operation 'Helpem Fren' to restore peace to the Solomon Islands, 23 December 2004. But if Malaita becomes a separate country, it will come at a cost. In an island where most people live on subsistence farming, University of Queenstown's Clive Moore says it will most likely require a foreign power, like Taiwan, to help prop it up, at least to begin with.It would also be tricky to extract the province from the rest of the country. The province is in a central position, and its population makes up around a third of the country. According to Moore, the province is so central to the Solomon Islands that a split would basically mean the \"destruction of a nation.\" \"If (Taiwan) really think a new nation in the Pacific could be their diplomatic friend, perhaps it's worth a punt,\" Moore said. \"But encouraging it, it would destroy the Solomon Islands.\"Just as Taiwan will need to decide whether its search for allies is worth the instability, the Solomon Islands will need to weigh up whether its intensified ties with Beijing are worth the risk. For now, the 104 people -- including more than 80 Chinese nationals -- who were on board the flight from China are serving out their state quarantine in the capital, Honiara. Only time will tell whether the instability that flight caused was worth it.",

        "content": "Hong Kong (CNN)On a hot summer night earlier this month, a few thousand people gathered in Hong Kong to honor a 28-year-old woman who many of them had never met.Under the glow of Hong Kong's harbor-side Ferris wheel, they lit candles, sang songs, and left messages to her on colorful Post-it notes, calling her \"brave.\"\"We will accomplish what is left to be done,\" wrote one.The death of the woman -- known to most of the world by her last name, Mak -- was the fourth suspected suicide to be connected by local media to ongoing demonstrations, sparked initially by a controversial extradition bill that many feared could further limit freedoms in the semi-autonomous city.The bill has been suspended, but over a period of just a few months the movement has developed into something bigger -- and darker. Some demonstrations -- including one on Sunday night -- have ended in aggression, with protesters using metal barricades to charge police, and police firing rounds of tear gas to disperse protesters.

The four who died have become fixtures in protest art and been treated by some demonstrators as heroes of the cause.But experts warn that this kind of rhetoric is risky. With many protesters in their teens and early 20s in a city where mental health support is lacking, they warn that treating protesters as heroes could be putting others in danger. The fight for Hong KongThe movement to block the extradition bill has been cast as a binary life or death struggle from the outset. When at least hundreds of thousands -- up to a million by some measures -- marched at the start of June, it was described by activists as the \"last chance to fight for Hong Kong.\" The deaths of the protesters only added to that intensity. Mourners in Hong Kong place flowers and offer prayers on June 16, 2019, at the site where a protester died.At demonstrations, protesters created banners from yellow raincoats, giving the illusion that the first death by suicide, a 35-year-old man who died wearing a distinctive yellow raincoat, was floating above them. Protesters wore black and waved black flags to honor the dead. In the mass outpouring of grief, some protesters pointed the finger at the government. For a time, a blood-red placard became ubiquitous. It read: \"Stop killing us.\"\"He sacrificed a lot for us,\" a 16-year-old schoolgirl, who only gave her name as Athena, said of the man at one of the marches. \"This is related to the political system of Hong Kong -- it's life-threatening and it's fateful.\"In places around the city, demonstrators held memorials for the dead. They piled flowers on footpaths that formed little mountains of white and plastic, and left notes to the dead that they would never read.\"Dear Hero, we will fight for you,\" read one on a piece of white paper decorated with a heart. \"He was dragged down by the regime,\" read another.Protesters hold placards during a demonstration against the now-suspended extradition bill on June 16, 2019 in Hong Kong. Those lost to suicide became fixtures in protest art, too. One showed the 35-year-old man and another victim holding hands as they walked toward the light with the words: \"Friend, don't leave. Hong Kong people, don't give up.\" Even messages that didn't depict the protesters took on a darker tone. \"If we burn, you burn with us,\" read a huge, deep-red banner.Among some protesters, death was a point of discussion. \"Die for Hong Kong,\" some protesters could be heard chanting. A manifesto shared on Telegram -- an encrypted app used widely during the protests -- thanked \"heroes who pay their blood and their lives.\"Protest posters depict a 35-year-old suicide victim in Admiralty, Hong Kong, on July 1, 2019. The one on the left reads: \"Friend, don't leave, Hong Kong people, don't give up.\" On the right: \"No one can be lacking, we need to work hard together.\"At a press conference, pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo called on protesters to \"drop the martyr mentality.\" \"We need to remind them that it is not worth it. Time is always on the side of the young,\" she said.The problem is, the young don't necessarily feel like that. Why things turned darkHong Kong is a city familiar with protests. But the protests haven't always been like this movement.In 2014, pro-democracy protesters occupied Hong Kong's inner city streets for 79 days. Although there were scuffles, it was largely peaceful and optimistic. The protesters -- among them, many high-school students -- sang songs, set up supply tents and even created areas to do their homework. Hope was in the air. There was a sense that democracy might finally be possible.Hong Kong has never had complete democracy. When the former British colony was handed over to China in 1997, Beijing promised to maintain Hong Kong's freedoms for the next 50 years.",

        "content": "Hong Kong (CNN)In a meeting room decorated with a stylized hammer and sickle flag, Kelly Hu detailed her shortcomings.Since childhood, the 20-year-old student had wanted to join the longest-running and largest communist party in the world, having grown up hearing \"red tales\" of its revolutionary past from her family. In recent years, as she embarked on the long journey to become a member of the Chinese Communist Party, she had balanced hours of lectures on party ideology with course work for her biology degree, and spent 30 minutes a day on a nationalist app reading articles and watching videos. Her latest challenge was to impress local party members. Hu, along with 12 other young hopefuls, presented a report on her family background and how her thoughts, studies and life had improved since receiving party training. Next, she fielded questions on her respective shortcomings -- for Hu, gaps in her knowledge of party history and being too strict with team members -- before being sent out of the room so the members could vote on their fate. Read MoreAll of them were accepted.\"When they announced that I had become a probationary party member, I was very happy, but the atmosphere was so solemn you couldn't show your happiness,\" said Hu, who is not using her real name as she is not authorized to speak to media, of the June meeting in southern China, where she studies. \"You had to appear calm and couldn't even clap.\"Hu will now spend a year as a probationary member, meaning she must perform the duties of a full member without the right to vote in party elections. At the end of the year, her local branch will decide whether to admit her to the party, which has grown from just 53 members when it was founded 100 years ago to more than 95 million.  JUST WATCHEDSee China's 'red holy sites' as Communist party marks centennial  ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSee China's 'red holy sites' as Communist party marks centennial   03:17In the past, Hu could have been a fairly silent member of the party, with little involvement in its politics. Many members simply joined because their families told them to, or because they wanted a leg up in China's highly competitive job market, and might not be fervent believers in party ideology.   But that is changing. Chinese President Xi Jinping, whose real power derives from his position as the head of the ruling Communist Party, has placed more emphasis on quality over quantity. He has demanded absolute loyalty from party members, launched an ideology drive to shore up their faith, and unleashed a crackdown on internal dissent. Members are bound by more stringent rules -- and millions of cadres have been investigated for violating them in the past nine years since Xi took control of the party. They are also joining at a time when the party is facing increased scrutiny overseas. The Chinese government has faced international opprobrium over its alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang, crackdown on Hong Kong and military expansions in the South China Sea. Its foreign policy has grown increasingly assertive, straining already deteriorating relations with Western nations and some of its neighbors.Those who still aspire to join face tighter rules and more requirements once they become members, as the party aims to weed out applicants joining for self-interested reasons, leaving only the most devoted members -- like Hu. What it takes to joinHu's journey to become a party member began in September 2019 with a five-page, handwritten letter.In it, she detailed why she wanted to join the party and how her actions aligned with its ideology. When the local branch released a list of potential names for membership, giving the public a chance to raise objections, she was on it. After passing that hurdle in April last year, Hu began attending party lectures, which she was required to submit handwritten notes  to ensure she was paying attention. Each day she spent half an hour on the Xuexiqiangguo app, which teaches Xi's ideology and translates literally to \"study the powerful nation\" or -- as a word play -- \"study Xi to empower the nation,\" a sign of Xi's growing personality cult. Xi's doctrine was written into the party's constitution in 2017, making him only the third Chinese leader to have his eponymous political philosophy enshrined in its theoretical pantheon.Every few months, Hu handed in a handwritten self-reflection report on how she had served the people and improved herself. Meanwhile, local branch members vetted her through her teachers, classmates, and even people she didn't know very well. \"Every layer of evaluation and selection is very strict,\" she said. \"For every evaluation, the party branch will go to the masses to learn about how you are in real life, instead of merely listening to your own reports.\"It's tough to gain admittance -- about 12% of applicants nationwide were accepted in 2019, according to party data. Already, Hu says the process has changed her. She says she spends a lot of time attending activities organized by her local party cell, which range from watching patriotic movies to doing volunteer work, such as cleaning school laboratories and teaching kindergarten children. Xiao Ya, 21, a probationary party member in the southern city of Guangzhou, said when she first applied, she didn't think too much about it. Everyone around her was applying to join, so she submitted an application, too.\"I merely followed the crowd,\" said Xiao Ya, who is also using a pseudonym to protect her identity. Soon, the party was taking up a large chunk of her life. She volunteered for marathons, and went to a remote, mountainous part of Guizhou province to teach in an ethnic minority village. Although the school had concrete floors and old desks, it had advanced projectors and computers which the principal told her were paid for by the country's poverty alleviation policy. She felt the government had helped rural communities a lot. \"I feel like I should learn from the party and improve myself to better serve the people,\" she said.JUST WATCHEDSee China's ruling Communist party celebrate centennial in Tiananmen Square ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSee China's ruling Communist party celebrate centennial in Tiananmen Square  02:23Both Xiao Ya and Hu have been subject to Xi's tougher requirements on new recruits, which were introduced in 2014. Although being admitted to the party has always involved a rigorous selection process, there are now even more demands. The hope is raising the barrier will keep people who aren't serious out. A decade ago, a rank-and-file party member would have only minimal requirements, such as attending one meeting a year and paying dues. Now, under Xi, there are more meetings and volunteer work expectations, said Bruce Dickson, a professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University and an expert on the Chinese Communist Party. According to\u00a0Dickson, one of his friends,\u00a0who is a party member,\u00a0says they have to study every new speech Xi gives.\"There are more demands -- especially on people's time -- than there have been before,\" Dickson said. \"If you're not going to be willing to step up for the party, then (Xi) doesn't really want you in it.\"Over the past five years, fewer people have been admitted to the party, perhaps because there's less interest in joining or a higher level of scrutiny on potential applicants, said Dickson.Nis Gr\u00fcnberg, a senior analyst from the Mercator Institute for China Studies who researches state-party governance, echoed that statement. He said the party wanted \"true believers\" and was \"trying to kind of weed out all those who use it to access networks and power.\"Xi wants a powerful party that he can quickly mobilize when needed. Since rising to power, he has reasserted the party to the center of Chinese life, doubled down on strengthening party building, and revitalized once-dormant grassroots party cells in companies and local communities.Why people join the partyJulian Li, who is in his late 20s, grew up in a military compound, where a portrait of Mao Zedong hung in his house. During the Cultural Revolution, his grandfather worked for the People's Liberation Army (PLA), escorting persecuted people to the countryside. His father worked for the government in Beijing, and hoped Li would follow his lead.His party membership was almost a foregone conclusion.At 18, Li, who asked not to use his real name to protect his family, joined the party -- not because he was especially interested in being a member or working for the government, but to please his father. He didn't even write his own application letter -- his father's secretary prepared the materials for him. Li's parents hoped party membership would help his career -- a reasonably common rationale for joining, according to Dickson. When the party was founded 100 years ago, its members were urban intellectuals -- blue-collar workers didn't read much Karl Marx, the German theorist whose ideology helped shaped that of the early party, Dickson said. Under Mao, the founding father of the party and the People's Republic of China, however, peasants were recruited. Membership soared from 4 million when he created the communist nation in 1949, to 35 million in 1977, shortly after his death.  After Jiang Zemin took over the party and presidency in 1989, he brought in a political doctrine that welcomed private business owners and the middle class into the fold. As China's economy boomed, recruitment shifted back to the urban elites, best-placed to help the country grow. Each year, the best and brightest are recruited. Of the 4.7 million new members accepted between January 1, 2020, and June 5 this year, 1.9 million -- or  40% -- were students, according to party data.For some, that has allowed the party to double as an excellent networking club for the country's most amibitious young professionals.A master's student in his 20s in Beijing -- who asked not to be named for privacy reasons -- said he was recruited in his senior year of high school. The headteacher of his class thought he was qualified because he was the vice class monitor, a student with additional responsibilities. \"I regarded it as the mark of an excellent student,\" he said. In state-owned companies, party members typically hold positions of authority -- and even in private firms, there's a notion party members are well educated and \"don't have skeletons in the closet,\" Dickson said. \"Almost in any sector you're in, there's a glass ceiling if you're not a party member,\" he added. There are exceptions to this -- although Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma is a party member, neither Pony Ma, founder and CEO of Tencent, nor Baidu co-founder Robin Li are members. Using party membership simply as a way to get ahead is something Xi wants to stop. Instead, he wants cadres to believe in his doctrine. \"He's clearly made a big emphasis that party members have to be loyal to the party above all else,\" Dickson said.Three recruits CNN spoke to for this story said they joined for ideological reasons. In today's China, publicly voicing other reasons would be controversial and potentially jeopardize their membership. Party member Xiao Ya says she didn't join for career purposes. Although she thinks members may be more likely to get promoted at work, she believes membership alone is not that useful for finding a job -- but it could be for those wanting to work in public service. As for the master's student, he says there are many people who believe in communism in the party -- but there's a range of motivations, and so long as people aren't motivated purely for selfish reasons, that's fine, he said.  \"Different people with different motives can join the party and we don't exclude you for having other ideas,\" he said. \"We accept multiple motives and don't require everyone to be 100% pure and noble.\"The effect of joining the partyNow working in finance in London, Julian Li says his party membership has little impact on his career or life, apart from making his move to the United Kingdom slightly more difficult. When he applied for a UK visa, he said he needed to declare he was a party member and whether he had handled any confidential information in China.\"I found that very troublesome,\" he said, adding he was annoyed he had to take another step for holding a membership he didn't want in the first place. Overseas, party membership often carries stigma. When public figures are revealed to be members, that's seen as a cause for concern. When the United States introduced immigration rules last year to curtail travel for party members, US authorities said they were imposing travel restrictions \"to protect our nation from the party's malign influence.\" These concerns have been heightened by recent accusations of espionage connected to Chinese officials and researchers linked to the Chinese military.In the past, the way some Western media and politicians have portrayed party membership has been unfair, says Gr\u00fcnberg, the senior analyst.Many members were simply patriots -- and it wasn't appropriate to suspect every one of being a Chinese agent. \"It's exaggerated if you portray all party members as just one monolithic big group of people who try to influence when they're abroad,\" Gr\u00fcnberg said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Just being a party member doesn't make you a cheerleader for the regime.\"Bruce DicksonA professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University  and an expert on the Chinese Communist Party\n\n\n\nDickson also sees that as a \"misreading\" of what membership implies. \"Of the almost 95 million people who are in the party, less than 10% actually have official positions,\" he said.\"Just being a party member doesn't make you a cheerleader for the regime.\"But Xi's demand for the absolute loyalty of party members has also made them a target of suspicion, as they're required -- at least officially -- to always toe the party line and serve its interests. For Julian Li, or others tired of the increasing demands and problems overseas, quitting isn't really an option.Some people are kicked out -- and the growing push to stamp out bad apples means punishments are exacted more often.\"The system is really looking more carefully, and in more detail at what people do and how they behave,\" Gr\u00fcnberg said. But if someone wanted to leave the party of their own accord, it's unclear how they might do that and what kind of consequences they might face. Although there was talk early in Xi's presidency about cleaning out inactive members, that idea was dropped after it became clear how many people might quit, Dickson said. \"Once they realize how many people might take them up on that opportunity, and once they realize how much the party might shrink as a consequence, they decided it wasn't worth the trouble,\" he said. That means the party must strike a balance between having the best-educated elite, and still being broadly representative of the general population, so it doesn't become out of touch, Gr\u00fcnberg said.\"You don't want too many in the club,\" he said. \"I think they firmly believe that they have found a good mix of both trying to get elites and the most capable people, but also staying a little in touch with the reality that is different around China.\"What party membership will mean in the futureWhile Xi's tightening of rules raises the possibility that party membership will mean more, experts say the obligations of members will need to not outweigh the benefits if the party wants to keep attracting talent. In 2013, the party set an annual growth target of about 1.5% over the next 10 years, according to Hong Kong newspaper the South China Morning Post. If members have to spend a couple of hours a week in study sessions, it seems like an \"anachronism\" that harks back to a different era when people lived simpler lives, Dickson said, adding that some people may decide it's not worth the trouble. \"It's just eating up more of their time, which is frustrating,\" he said. It's also possible that Xi's tough rules both for being accepted, and for current members, won't continue and were merely in place in the lead-up to the party's centenary, which fell on July 1. \"It just seems so out of step with the current situation,\" Dickson said. \"Xi is trying to make loyal party members out of all party members, and it's not clear it's going to have that much success because people are leading busy lives.\" If people are force-fed a routine, \"it doesn't build loyalty, it builds resentment. So it could very easily backfire,\" he added. \"If the best and brightest don't want to join the party, they may have to reassess this emphasis on loyalty.\"",

        "content": "Hong Kong (CNN)If it weren't for the novel coronavirus outbreak, Xu Mingxi would have been in class at a prestigious New York university this week.  Instead, the 22-year-old has spent the past three weeks confined to his family's apartment in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the center of the outbreak, which is currently on lockdown to prevent the virus spreading.But even if Xu could leave home, the United States -- where he's studied for the past four-and-a-half years -- won't let him in. Over 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) away in Beijing, Alex -- who asked not to use her real name for fear of online retribution -- is in a similar situation. She's spent the past two weeks at home with her mom and grandpa, being delivered groceries by community leaders. She's worried she won't be able to fly to Sydney to study later this month and may have to delay her law degree by a semester.As novel coronavirus spreads, over 60 countries have imposed travel restrictions on Chinese citizens, hoping to limit their exposure to the virus that has killed more than 1,600 people, almost all in mainland China, and infected over 68,000 worldwide. Both Australia and the US have put temporary bans on foreign nationals who visited China in the 14 days prior to their arrival.  Read MoreThat has locked Xu and Alex out of their studies -- and they are by no means alone.In 2017, an estimated 900,000 Chinese tertiary students studied abroad. Around half of those went to either the United States or Australia, contributing billions of dollars to their economies -- money that those countries now stand to lose.        It is not clear how many of the 360,000 Chinese students studying in the US were outside the country when the US travel ban hit on January 31, shortly before many universities were due to resume. But when Australia imposed its restrictions at the start of February, authorities estimated that 56% of Chinese students -- about 106,680 people -- were still abroad. Term was due to begin in late February or early March. \"For Australia, it couldn't have come at a worse time. It's exactly the time of the year in which people are coming from China to Australia,\" said Andrew Norton, a professor in the practice of higher education policy at the Australian National University. The virus outbreak coincided with the Lunar New Year -- the most important holiday in the Chinese calendar, when many students go home to see their family.A city on lockdownAt first, it was just a normal holiday period for Xu, catching up with friends in Wuhan and eating food. The coronavirus outbreak didn't seem like a huge issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline\n\n\n\n\nHow events unfolded\n\n\n\nDecember 8: The first patient of Wuhan coronavirus developed symptoms\nDecember 31: The first cases reported to the World Health Organization\nJanuary 1: The market in Wuhan where the outbreak is believed to have started shuts down for disinfection\nJanuary 8: Chinese scientists identify the pathogen as a new strain of coronavirus\nJanuary 23: Authorities put Wuhan into partial lockdown\nJanuary 31: US announces it will deny entry to foreign nationals who have traveled in China in the last 14 days\nFebruary 1: Australia bans all travellers entering from mainland China\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: CNN reporting\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXu wore a mask and avoided the area around the seafood market linked to the outbreak, which is only a few kilometers from his house.Then on January 23, the night before he was set to fly back to New York, Wuhan authorities announced they were locking down the city. There was still time to leave, but Xu decided not to go -- he thought he would be safer inside Wuhan, and that the lockdown wouldn't last long.On January 27, his graduate program in interactive telecommunications at New York University (NYU) restarted. On January 31, the US government announced it wouldn't let any foreign nationals flying from mainland China into the country.Xu was told he could take classes remotely, but to him it wasn't worth paying $62,000 per year in course fees for distance learning. He decided to take a break this semester. That will delay his graduation by six months.The situation in AustraliaThe University of Sydney, where Alex studies, is making allowances for Chinese students.Those affected by coronavirus travel bans can study remotely, start their semester a few weeks late, or defer their degree. Alex will defer this semester if she hasn't been able to fly back by mid-March.She pays about $45,000 Australian dollars ($30,280) each year -- more than local students, who are eligible for reduced fees. When Australia imposed its travel ban on February 1, it was effective immediately. While the WHO has advised against such measures, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said: \"Our medical advice is it's in the interest of Australians to do so.\" At the time, there were 80 Chinese people in transit -- including 47 students. Australian Border Force commissioner Michael Outram told the ABC that 18 decided to go back to China, while the others were put into self-isolation for 14 days. \"This was a very difficult situation for the students, of course, we recognize that,\" Outram said. \"They were caught between, you know, an epidemic in China and coming to Australia and having issues raised with their visas.\"A man walks on an empty street in Wuhan, China, on February 13, 2020.David, a 24-year-old studying engineering at the University of Sydney, who has been in self-imposed quarantine at his home in southern Guangdong province for weeks, said the Australian government's actions made him feel \"completely neglected.\"\"I'm a taxpayer, I do my part in society, I've donated blood,\" said David, who asked not to use his real name for fear that his comments could hurt his chance of getting an Australian visa. \"After all the things I've done, you still consider me not part of your society.\"The logistical problems created by the virus are not short-term issues.Universities will need to work out how to accommodate the backlog of students like Xu and Alex who have been delayed, as well as students who would have taken those courses anyway -- and some universities just won't have capacity, Norton said.   Protesters hold placards during a rally against an inbound travel ban on foreign travellers from China in Sydney on February 7, 2020. What this means for the universitiesIf thousands of students are forced to forgo this semester, universities in Australia and the United States stand to lose billions of dollars.In Australia, 23.3% of universities' total revenue came from international students in 2017 -- and Chinese students made up over 38% of all international enrollments in 2018. In total, international education contributed 37.6 billion Australian dollars ($25 billion) to the Australian economy in the 2018-2019 financial year. In the US, Chinese students contributed $14.9 billion to the US economy in 2018, according to government data. Norton, the professor of higher education policy at the Australian National University, believes that most Chinese students in Australia will need to delay their study by at least a trimester or semester. That means that, in the short term, universities in Australia face an estimated 2 to 3 billion Australian dollar cash flow hit from students who can't make it to class, he said.\"The government realizes this will have huge economic costs that effect them as well as the universities and tourism providers,\" he said.      In the US, there had already been weakening demand from Chinese students partly due to tensions on American campuses amid the ongoing trade war, said Rahul Choudaha, a US-based analyst of international student trends and a visiting scholar at the Center for Studies in Higher Education at UC Berkeley. \"It's kind of a very unexpected, unwanted, undesirable speed bump,\" he said.It's also an issue facing universities outside of the United States and Australia. South Korea, for instance, has around 70,000 Chinese students at its universities. The new semester kicks off in March, but already many universities have opted to delay the start of semester by two weeks, to accommodate students living in cities on lockdown.A man wears a protective mask as he walks in Wuhan on February 13, 2020.Anger at Chinese peopleThe coronavirus crisis struck at a time when hostile debates over Chinese Communist Party influence on Australian and US campuses were already complicating life for Chinese students overseas.Chinese students have been accused of stealing American secrets to diminish US influence, especially as the trade war between China and American rages. In Australia, politicians have raised concern over whether the Chinese influence on campus is limiting free speech. For Chinese people in Australia and the US, that public debate has sometimes been alienating. Now, the coronavirus outbreak has prompted more anti-Chinese sentiment. As the coronavirus spreads, fear is fueling racism and xenophobiaWhile stuck at home, Alex has been taken by the different reactions to the outbreak on China's heavily controlled internet and the internet beyond the so-called Great Firewall. In China, there are messages of support for Wuhan, but internationally she's seen anger directed at Chinese people.\"It's waves and waves of hate,\" she said, pointing to online commentators who argued that Chinese people deserved the outbreak because they eat bat -- something that has not been linked to the outbreak. \"I felt misunderstood, I felt abandoned. I felt I don't matter.\"Alex says that on her social media feeds the situation has been turned into a Chinese versus Australian dichotomy, when really, it's about the virus versus people. She's afraid that when she gets back to Australia, she could be the target of racial abuse. People who look Chinese are \"paying the price just because other people are scared,\" she said.Economic hitAlready, experts are predicting that the economic hit of the coronavirus could be much more significant than the SARS epidemic in 2003.If China's economy is struggling, Chinese parents may have less money to spend on educating their children overseas. David believes that the perceived animosity toward Chinese students in Australia may result in students opting to go elsewhere. When parents are looking at which country to send their children, they don't just look at the quality of education -- but also at how welcoming and stable a society is, he says. As the quality of China's own universities continues to improve, staying at home could also become a more attractive proposition, said Choudah, the higher education analyst. A few days ago, a fellow Chinese national asked Alex whether she would recommend studying law in Australia. Alex answered honestly: she's torn.Studying abroad can be a positive experience, she said, but it also carries the risk of racial abuse, especially now that people of Asian origin are viewed with suspicion as the virus spreads. Xu isn't worried about negative reactions when he is finally able to go back to New York -- after all, as a Wuhan native, he now faces potential discrimination within China, too.

        "content": "(CNN)In the first week of January, reports emerged that a mysterious new form of pneumonia had affected dozens of people in China. Some were in a critical condition, and a number had invasive lesions on both lungs. Thousands of miles away in Berlin, German scientist Olfert Landt was already on alert. For 30 years, he had worked on diagnosing emerging diseases, including Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). He wanted to make a test kit to help doctors diagnose the disease -- and he wanted to do it fast. Virologists usually wait until the genetic material of a new virus is sequenced to start working on a test. This time, Landt and his 30-strong company TIB Molbiol got started early. By January 9 they had designed their first test kit using SARS and other known coronaviruses as references. Along with scientists from a local university hospital, he designed three kits, meaning once the sequence was published, they could pick the one that worked best. Olfert Landt with his coronavirus diagnostic test kit at his production facility in Berlin, Germany, on March 6, 2020. On January 11, Landt sent his kit to Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control and diagnostic company Roche in Hong Kong. He didn't know for certain that it would work, and he hadn't even prepared instructions.Over the weekend, he worked up a manual and emailed it over. \"We said, listen, you have six tubes without any instructions,\" he recalls. \"Give them to the test laboratory, you can test patients with this.\"Read MoreIn the end, the test he sent over was perfect, he said. On January 17, the World Health Organization (WHO) published Landt's protocol online, making it the first test to be shared by the organization. Landt estimates he has manufactured four million tests by the end of February, and another 1.5 million each week since then. Each kit -- which includes 100 tests -- has sold for at least 160 euro ($173) each to clients in Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Australia, Europe, with his two adult children helping label and pack the kits. His wife, who has worked for the company for 15 years, is also involved. \"I'm not working for money. I take the money, yes, it's fair, we do good work,\" he said. \"But in the end, we don't need money.\"The test kit Olfert Landt designed, displayed at his production facility in Berlin, Germany, on March 6, 2020. When it comes to stopping the spread of a pandemic, testing is key. If a person is diagnosed, they can be isolated from others and treated appropriately. As WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said earlier this month: \"We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test.\"But nearly three months after Landt first noticed reports of a mysterious disease, countries around the world are still struggling to test for Covid-19, the infectious disease caused by a new novel coronavirus. Some tests are inaccurate, others took a long time to create, and now testing companies are warning they are running dangerously low on materials.That raises an important question: if a test can be developed so quickly, why are some countries still struggling? The first designsIn Hong Kong, virologist Leo Poon was also watching the developments unfold in January.Like Landt, he had worked on emerging diseases for years. In 2003, it was his team of scientists at Hong Kong University (HKU) who identified that SARS, which had emerged the year before in mainland China, was a coronavirus. \"Because we have gone through all these events in the past, we know how important it is to have a working diagnostic test,\" he said. \"That's why we basically tried to get the work done as soon as possible.\"But unlike Landt, Poon waited for the sequence.Dr Leo Poon Lit-man on the University of Hong Kong campus in Pok Fu Lam.All forms of life have a type of molecule that carries their genetic instructions. In humans, and most life forms, that's DNA -- the genetic material that tells us to grow two legs and walk upright. Instead of DNA, many viruses -- including hepatitis, Ebola, and rabies -- have RNA, or ribonucleic acid, which, like DNA, is a nucleic acid that carries genetic information. Across the border from Hong Kong in mainland China, scientists were working to identify the RNA of the new virus. According to a report in Chinese news magazine Caixin, the new virus now known as SARS-CoV-2 may have been mostly sequenced as early as December 27. But it wasn't until January 11, that the sequenced genome was posted on open-source site virological.org on behalf of Zhang Yongzhen, a professor from Shanghai's Fudan University. Chinese authorities shared the sequence on January 12.Once Zhang shared the sequence, Poon's team started work. First, they looked at the RNA of the new coronavirus, and decided their test would target parts of the code that were similar to the RNA of the SARS coronavirus -- parts that would be less likely to mutate, as they were essential to the virus. Next, they designed the test.     The standard way to detect a virus is using a technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Invented in the 1980s, PCR is used for a range of things, from identifying the DNA of a suspect at a crime scene, to testing whether a crop of fruit is infected with a virus.PCR tests are made up of ingredients called reagents, which include primers and probes.  Before running a PCR test, the RNA in a virus has to be turned into a DNA copy. Then, the primers look for the target regions within a gene. If they find the gene targets, then these regions are copied over and over, explained Maureen Ferran, an associate professor of biology at Rochester Institute of Technology. Each time a copy is made of the DNA, light will be emitted. If there's a lot of light, that indicates the presence of the genetic material that identifies the virus -- meaning that a person has tested positive for the virus.  Most kits have at least two genetic targets, to improve the reliability of the result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe race to test\n\n\n\n\n2019\n\n\n\nDecember 31: Cases of pneumonia detected in Wuhan, China,\u00a0are first reported to the WHO.\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\nJanuary 5: China announces that the unknown pneumonia cases in Wuhan are not SARS or MERS.\nJanuary 7: Chinese authorities confirm that they have identified the virus as a novel coronavirus, initially named\u00a02019-nCoV\u00a0by the WHO.\nJanuary 11: The sequenced genome is posted on open-source site virological.org.\n                        The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission announces the first death caused by the coronavirus.\n                        Berlin scientist Olfert Landt and his team send their test kit to Hong Kong and Taiwan.\nJanuary 12: Chinese authorities share the sequence on January 12.\nJanuary 16: Hong Kong University scientists submit their kit to the World Health Organization.\nJanuary 17: A top health official says the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has made its own test, without using the protocols published by the WHO.\nFebruary 11: The WHO names the coronavirus Covid-19.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources: CNN reporting, World Health Organization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll this is taking place on a tiny scale -- in test tubes, within a diagnostic machine. The diagnostic machine measures the level of light, and compares it with the positive control -- usually a sample of the virus. If the positive control doesn't test positive, then scientists will know that the test isn't working. Developing a test is not difficult, according to Nathan Grubaugh, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Yale School of Medicine. The trick is making sure it doesn't pick up other viruses, too. Within six days of getting the sequence, Poon had a working test.  Like Landt's kit, Poon's test can pick up SARS and Covid-19. Poon says that isn't an issue, as there isn't currently a SARS outbreak. In the months since, Poon has sent tests for free to more than 40 countries all over the world, including Egypt and Cambodia. Each country only gets one kit, which costs between 4,000 to 5,000 Hong Kong dollars ($515 to $644) and can be used to test 100 samples. Some countries, like Nepal, have sent their samples to Hong Kong University to test. The idea is to \"buy some time\" for countries, so they have a test while mobilizing resources to create their own. But while companies like TIB Molbiol are making money from their kits, Poon and his team have reallocated funding from other projects to their Covid-19 test kits, and are essentially working for free. \"We don't have money, we have zero resources,\" said Poon. \"We are just distributing it from our good will.\"Others, too, having been giving away vital information for free. The WHO lists seven protocols on its website -- they are essentially how-to guides for scientists hoping to make their own test kit. Both Landt and Poon's tests are laid out in detail.\"The (intellectual property) issue is not what we care about in this public health crisis,\" Poon said. \"What drives us to do this work is to try to react to these emerging infections so we can save more lives.\"To make a new test -- or to use a preexisting oneIn mid-January, in Gisborne, a sunny city on the coast of New Zealand, John Mackay got a request from the government's National Reference Laboratory -- he needed to buy materials to detect the coronavirus.Mackay, the technical director of diagnostics lab Dnature, emailed Landt. \"Olfret, if this is playing out like SARS, I'm guessing you have the kits sitting on the shelf ready to go immediately,\" he recalls writing that afternoon.Within half an hour, there was a reply from Landt, despite it being early morning, Berlin time. \"Yes, do you want some?\"\"The guy is a complete workaholic,\" Mackay said of Landt. \"He's a phenomenal guy.\"The kits were sent to New Zealand, and around a month before the country would have its first case, the authorities were ready to test.It was a similar situation in Australia. Like New Zealand, they had no samples of the virus, so they referred to tests developed overseas, according to William Rawlinson, the director of Serology, Virology and OTDS Laboratories, which leads much of the testing in the Australian state of New South Wales. Even before Australia had its first case, it had kits. Other countries decided to go it alone.One of the earliest tests was developed in mainland China by the country's Center for Disease Control. By January 24, its protocol had been posted on the WHO website. Health workers dressed in personal protective equipment await new patients at a drive-thru coronavirus testing station in Stamford, Connecticut, on March 23, 2020.But as the outbreak raged in mainland China in early February, a number of people tested negative, only to later test positive. In a report in Chinese state newspaper China Daily, Gao Zhancheng, head of the respiratory and critical care department at Peking University's People's Hospital, said a number of factors could have impacted testing besides the test itself, including the way doctors took the sample, and the circumstances at laboratories.Initially, China also appeared to struggle with a shortage of PCR test kits -- so much so that China's Ministry of Science and Technology called for research into other types of tests, according to state media Xinhua. Some people were forced to wait to be tested as China's health care system was stretched by the outbreak.  In the United States, there were also problems. On January 17 -- the same day that the WHO published Landt's protocol -- a top health official said the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had made its own test, without using the protocols published by the WHO.The agency announced on February 5 that it would begin shipping kits. Soon after, some labs reported that the tests were not working, meaning some had to be re-manufactured. It's not clear how the defect happened. Why the world needs multiple test kitsIt's easy to see how Landt and Poon's early work helped other countries buy time and prepare for an outbreak. But neither Landt nor Poon have the capacity to make enough tests for the whole world. And there are other also reasons why the world needs multiple test kits. You want a coronavirus test -- here's why your doctor probably won't give you oneFor one, scientists don't know for sure at first that their test will work. In the US, for instance, the manufacturing defect created a lag in testing -- if everyone in the world had been reliant on that one test, that would have created an even bigger problem. Another issue is that the virus could potentially mutate in such a way that one kit no longer works. If a test targets Covid-19's \"N\" gene, for instance, and the virus mutates so that gene no longer exists, then the kit will not pick up the virus. Another consideration is that a test that works in one country might not work in another, said Rawlinson. If, hypothetically, the presence of dengue fever caused a test not to work, and a country had a large rate of dengue fever, then there might be a high rate of false negative, he said. Having a range of tests also puts less pressure on one manufacturer or supply chain, as different suppliers may use different materials. In the US, for instance, medical officials have said they are short of test supplies, including swaps, reagents, and pipettes -- the tools for transporting liquids. The shortage forced Minnesota and Ohio to limit testing to the most vulnerable patients. Japanese test distributor Kurabo, which makes a different type of test that looks for antibodies, claims its test only takes 15 minutes to give a result -- and use blood samples rather than swabbed specimens.A test kit designed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Test supplier Roche Diagnostics Corporation says it is distributing 400,000 tests per week to labs in the United States, but that isn't enough to keep pace with demand. \"At the height of any global health emergency, demand will outweigh supply,\" said company spokesman Michael Weist.Ferran said testing could have changed the US's infection rate.\"If we had better testing early on, we could have really changed the rate of infection. But we can't go back,\" she said. \"We just have to go forward and learn from this and have this not happen again.\"Beyond the test kitsPut bluntly, some countries have squandered the opportunity to prepare that Poon and Landt's early work gave them. Both the United States and the United Kingdom have been criticized for being slow to test, and for not testing enough people. US Centers for Disease Control and public health labs have tested more than 71,000 specimens, according to CDC's website, although Vice President Mike Pence said Sunday that 254,000 Americans have been tested so far. As of March 22, the United Kingdom had tested 72,818 people.That's in stark contrast with the approach of other countries.In the tiny island nation of Iceland, health authorities have undertaken comprehensive screening. As of March 21, more than 9,700 of the country's 350,000 population had been tested. Here's why the US is behind in coronavirus testingIn South Korea, the government has made testing incredibly accessible, including at drive-through labs. That has seen the country test over 300,000 people out of its 52 million population. And in New Zealand, where there are 102 confirmed cases, about 1% to 2% of tests are coming back positive, compared with 5% in the UK and 13% in the US, according to the Ministry of Health's Director-General of Health, Ashley Bloomfield. \"We're doing a lot of testing comparatively,\" he said. \"We want to find the cases which is why we're testing where there's suspicion.\"Poon says there are a number of reasons why some countries have been slow to test -- some are practical, others administrative. Testing requires trained staff, the right equipment, and the right materials -- a lack of any of those could hold up testing.In the US, there has been an additional bureaucratic hoop. In some countries, tests can be used almost immediately due to different rules around emerging diseases. A medical professional is seen at a preliminary testing facility at the National Medical Center where patients suspected of contracting coronavirus are assessed on February 21, 2020 in Seoul, South Korea. At first, in the US, all tests required  authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). More than 100 virologists and other specialists wrote a letter to Congress on February 28 which said many labs had validated tests for coronavirus but they could not use them due to the FDA's protocol for allowing tests during outbreaks.The FDA has now allowed companies to manufacture and ship tests before receiving permission. Thanks to the loosened rules, private companies have been able to speed up their response. US company Quest Diagnostics, for instance, launched its new test on March 9 and expects to be able to perform 280,000 tests per week by the start of April. By contrast, in South Korea, a company was able to get its test approved within a week. To people like Landt, inaction from politicians is frustrating.He recalls being at the opera at the start of February, when very few people had been infected in Munich, and approaching the German Minister of Health, who he saw there by chance. \"You should tell the public this is a bad disease,\" he recalls telling him. \"Don't tell them it's only something in China.\"But the German government was slow to take vital action, such as reducing social contact. It now has more than 29,000 confirmed cases. \"The virus must travel,\" Landt said, explaining whether the virus kills the host, or the host's immune system kill the virus, either way, the virus will need to find another person to infect to stay alive. \"If you reduce your contact to other people, the virus can no longer travel ... One infected will infect one or two other people, so it's like an atomic bomb, it's an exponential curve,\" he said. \"Only with testing we can identify people and isolate them to prevent the spread over to other people.\"CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki and Rebecca Wright contributed additional reporting from Tokyo.",

As they sit on the floor of their brightly painted Delhi home, she places another plate of food in front of a framed photo of her parents. They died just a few weeks ago from Covid-19. The 23-year-old teacher has become the primary caregiver and breadwinner for five of her siblings, between 4 and 14 years old, and a major pillar of strength for her eldest 20-year-old sister. She's barely had time to grieve.  \"My biggest fear is whether I will be able to love them like Mom and Dad or not,\" said Devika, who is only using her first name over privacy concerns. \"I will earn money; I have faith in myself. My sister will also earn money; I have faith in her. We can do what needs to be done in terms of money, but the absence of parents in their lives is a huge gap to fill, how can we ever fill that void?\" she said.\n\n\n\nDevika's siblings eat breakfast in their New Delhi home on June 2, 2021. Credit: Vijay Bedi/CNN\nRead MoreThey are among at least 577 Indian children who lost both parents to Covid between April 1 and May 25, when India was battling its second wave of the outbreak, according to government figures. But non-government organizations fear that many other orphans -- potentially thousands -- have been missed in the official count due to the difficulty in tracing children who have lost both parents.  Social workers are scrambling to track them down, worried they may be vulnerable to traffickers or end up on the streets if left to fend for themselves. 'They're together now'Just a few months ago, life looked very different for Devika and her family. Devika was focused on studying for a bachelor of education degree, and teaching children in her spare time.  Her father worked as a pandit -- or Hindu priest -- at a temple, and visited homes to perform rituals. He insisted on going out to work, even as cases soared in the capital. Her mother mostly stayed home, taking care of the children, and sometimes helped out at the temple, too.  At the end of April, when India was reporting more than 350,000 daily cases, leaving hospitals overburdened and oxygen in desperately short supply, Devika's 38-year-old mother gave her some worrying news: she had a fever. Devika tried to isolate the children upstairs, but it was too late. The whole family -- including her 53-year-old father -- developed a fever. Although the children were never screened for Covid-19, Devika's mother later tested positive in hospital. Devika's parents, who both passed away during India's second wave of Covid-19. The children recovered, but their mother's condition deteriorated and getting her proper medical care proved impossible. After visiting three hospitals in one night, Devika eventually found one in a nearby city that would take her mother, although it didn't have oxygen or ventilators.\"We were so helpless. We did whatever we could possibly do. But we failed,\" she said. Around the same time, her father was admitted to a Delhi hospital. When her mother died on April 29, Devika didn't have the courage to tell him. He had a phrase he would say a lot to his wife: \"Without you, there's no fun in living.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\"My father doted on Mummy. They're together now.\"Devika\n\n\n\nDevika recalled the moment her mother's body was taken to the Delhi hospital where her father was being treated, so he could see her one last time before she was cremated.  \"Mom was in the ambulance, Dad came out of the hospital and then he saw. He lowered his eyes, and he didn't say anything,\" Devika said.After that, she thinks her father lost the will to live. Just a week later, on May 7, he died of Covid, too. \"We really think he wanted to go with Mom,\" Devika said. \"My father doted on Mummy. They're together now,\" she added, crying.\n\n\n\nDevika sits in front of a shrine to her parents.\n Credit: Vijay Bedi/CNN\nAfter her parents died, Devika worried the authorities would remove her siblings from her. She called up a government-run child care hotline for advice. They told her she was the primary guardian -- and it was up to her to decide what to do.The past few weeks have been a blur. Devika took out loans to pay for her parents' hospital treatment, and now that money is helping to keep the family going. She juggles caring for her siblings with her university workload and her part-time job. The family also gets dry rations from non-government organizations, Prayaas and Childline. Devika hasn't had time yet to process her own grief; she wants to be strong for her siblings.  \"So much has happened that the tears don't come,\" she said.What's being done to helpDevika told the child hotline that she had lost both her parents -- but that's not always the case. Organizations are searching for children who may need their help, and are relying on social media, hearsay and calls to Childline, a Ministry of Women and Child Development service which existed before Covid.For rural children, accessing help can be hard. They have less internet access and fewer safety nets, says Save the Children India chief executive Sudarshan Suchi. \"The ones we don't know of is what worries me more,\" Suchi said. They also have to contend with restrictions on movement, incorrect information, and fear of contracting Covid from neighbors who might have otherwise helped.In one instance, Save the Children staff found out about two children whose father died in hospital and whose mother died at home, both from Covid. Both children were suspected of having Covid, so the neighbors in their slum avoided helping them and the children were unable to use the common bathroom spaces, Suchi said. \"If previously an earthquake or flood came into a small village or colony, everybody came together and found ways to rescue. When Covid comes, the first thought everybody has is keep away,\" Suchi said. \"It's an unknown ghost. People with collective spirit and traditions of community action are partly wary today of these kinds of things.\" Devika's sister prepares food in the kitchen of their New Delhi home on June 2, 2021.If things go smoothly, children can be connected with their extended family -- the general principle is that institutional care cannot be the first resort, and that a family environment is better for the child, said Anurag Kundu, the chairperson for Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights. But organizations worry about what happens if vulnerable children fall through the cracks, leaving them at risk of winding up on the streets or being trafficked.In May, Union Cabinet Minister for Women and Child Development Smriti Z Irani urged people who hear about orphaned children to tell the authorities -- and not to share information about them online, lest they are targeted by traffickers. \"We all must ensure legal adoption, otherwise children can be trafficked in the name of adoption,\" she tweeted. Devika's siblings at their New Delhi home on June 2, 2021.There's little data on the numbers of children being trafficked due to the pandemic, but there are already signs of more homeless children. That could be because their parents have died from Covid, or because their parents can no longer care for them as they've lost their job.\"Before the pandemic, under normal circumstances, there were more than 2 million children in distress as such on any day on the streets,\" Suchi said in May. \"If anything in the pandemic it could only go worse, not better.\"Even before the second wave, more children were living on the streets, Kundu said -- mostly likely victims of India's months-long lockdown that left the country's millions of daily wage earners without work.\"I have never seen so many children on the streets in my whole life as many as I've seen in the last 12 months,\" Kundu said. \"The socioeconomic aspect of it will be felt in the times to come.\"What the future looks likeFor now, the focus is on keeping children safe. But India's Covid orphans demonstrate how the devastation of the past year will likely be felt long after the pandemic is over. India's government has rolled out financial support for children orphaned by Covid, offering them free education and a $13,732 personal fund to be given as a monthly stipend for five years once they turn 18. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"If previously an earthquake or flood came into a small village or colony, everybody came together and found ways to rescue. When Covid comes, the first thought everybody has is keep away.\"Sudarshan Suchi\n\n\n\n\"Children represent the future of the country and the country will do everything possible to support and protect the children so that they develop as strong citizens and have a bright future,\" said a statement from Prime Minister Narendra Modi in May when those measures were announced. Suchi said the first priority was survival. \"These children, being already vulnerable, are going to get into a spiral in this. It's not just a question of their sickness from Covid -- it's about their education, it's about their health, it's about their basic social security fabric has come apart suddenly,\" Suchi said. After that, there needed to be support for their future. \"You can't rescue a child from midstream and then let them drown towards the end of the stream or somewhere towards the bank.\"\n\n\n\nDevika, who is now the guardian of five of her siblings, brushes her younger sister's hair. Credit: Vijay Bedi/CNN\nUNICEF India's representative Yasmin Ali Haque agreed, saying it was important to look at not just the child's physical needs -- adequate shelter, food, education, for example -- but also the psychological impact. \"The child is deprived of the loving care of their parents, of growing up in a family environment,\" she said. \"The psychosocial impact on a child can be long lasting, can be lifelong.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The psychosocial impact on a child can be long lasting, can be lifelong.\"Yasmin Haque\n\n\n\nThe future of her siblings weighs heavily on Devika. She hasn't told her youngest siblings that their parents are dead -- for now, they've been told their parents have gone back to their village in the countryside.  When her parents were alive, Devika questioned why they went out as the pandemic raged -- the day her mum developed a fever, Devika had asked her not to go to help at the temple. Devika told them it was more important to be alive and safe than to earn.\"I never understood why,\" she said. \"Now that I am where they were, I finally understand them. I get why they left the house.\" Vedika Sud and Esha Mitra reported from New Delhi. Julia Hollingsworth wrote and reported from Hong Kong. Sandi Sidhu contributed reporting.

South Korea peaked early, prompting praise for the government's handling of the pandemic. The country isn't in lockdown, and of the more than 10,500 confirmed cases, more than 7,400 have recovered. Nevertheless, South Korea has made a number of election concessions for the virus.     More than 11 million people -- or 26.7% of registered voters -- cast their vote in advance to avoid crowds, according to the National Election Commission. Early voters, and those casting their vote on Wednesday, will have their temperature checked at the door. Polling booths will be regularly disinfected and anyone with a temperature of more than 37.5 degrees Celsius (99.5 degrees Farenheit) will have to vote in a special booth. About 20,000 additional workers will be dispatched to put in place the extra measures.Special voting booths have been set up at government-run isolation centers, and those under self-quarantine will be allowed to leave their house to vote after polling booths close to the public at 6 p.m. A South Korean woman casts a ballot during early voting at a polling station in Seoul on April 10.Voters CNN talked to were supportive of the decision to go ahead. Some said the pandemic made voting even more important. \"I'm not too worried about catching the virus at the polling station as we'll keep social distancing in mind,\" said 53-year-old Lee Chang-Hoe, who runs a fish tempura shop at the market in Dongdaemun where the UFP rally took place. \"Just like a frozen river in winter, even though there is thick layer of ice on the surface, water must flow underneath -- I think it's the same for the election, even during this coronavirus outbreak, elections must go on.\"But experts warn that going ahead with an election and delaying an election both come with risks -- not just to public health, but to democracy. \"Intuitively, we think postponing an election sounds anti-democratic,\" said Toby James, a professor of politics and public policy at the University of East Anglia. \"But actually democracy in some ways could be undermined by holding an election in these times.\" Going ahead with an electionThere's historical precedent for going ahead with elections in a time of crisis.In 1864, the US held a presidential election despite the country being in the midst of a civil war. During the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak that killed about 675,000 people in the US alone, the country went ahead with its mid-term vote, although the turnout was very low, according to the New York Times. As James points out, postponing an election is not something democracies like to do, both for the health of the democracy and for practical reasons. \"Elections are a huge logistical task. They take years of planning, it's very difficult to unpick from those arrangements,\" he said. The Australian state of Queensland went ahead with its local body elections on March 28, with the state's electoral commission calling elections \"an essential service.\" But there was a backlash -- medical experts warned that holding an election posed a \"lethal risk,\" and political experts warned there could be a lower turn out. Voters keep a distance in Brisbane, Australia, on March 28.Like South Korea, the state took precautions. Voters were asked to bring their own pencils and hand sanitizer was supplied at polling booths. Those in isolation due to Covid-19 were allowed to vote by telephone, and around a third of voters cast their ballot during the early voting period, reducing the numbers of voters on election day.  In Australia, voting is compulsory -- and anyone who didn't vote in Queensland faces a possible $133.45 (about $86) fine. Nevertheless, early figures put the turnout at around 75%, down from around 83% during the last election.\"You don't know how many people would have liked to have voted, but felt too concerned,\" said University of Queensland electoral law expert Graeme Orr. Low turnout is one of the risks of holding an election during a pandemic. James noted that turnout also dropped in France's mayoral election in mid-March and Mali's long-awaited parliamentary election held two weeks later.A voter casts their ballot in front of an official wearing plastic gloves in a polling station in Lyon on March 15. Detailed information on voter demographics hasn't been released, but James noted that some at-risk groups may have chosen not to vote, which could affect the final count. Orr said Queensland should have suspended in-person voting, and instead held an all postal ballot. Although US President Donald Trump claimed that voting-by-mail is \"corrupt\" and \"dangerous,\" due to the risks of voter fraud, experts believe that postal voting will be key for any country holding an election during the pandemic.Campaigning in a pandemicIn a healthy democracy, elections are a time to discuss a wide range of topics.But right now, there's really only one topic dominating conversation. James points out that holding an election during a crisis means discussion is often limited to how well the government is responding to it. \"It doesn't allow a full range of issues to be discussed, and it does really undermine a sense of democracy,\" he said.That was the case during the election in Queensland, where there was no space to talk about non-pandemic issues, Orr said. Another issue is the difficulty of communicating with voters. If countries are in lockdown, rallies, door-knocking, meeting voters in shopping malls -- might not be possible. That was something that former South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon found during this year's campaign. He said hugs and handshakes can be more impactful than words, but social distancing has ruled that out for now. \"We are limited in expressing our feeling this time,\" he told CNN as he campaigned in the Jogno district of Seoul. Despite that, CNN spotted Lee hugging a supporter as he campaigned. Lee Nak-yeon, a candidate of the ruling Democratic Party, wears a mask as he meets with supporters on April 10 in Seoul, South Korea. In recent years, electioneering in many countries has increasingly moved online -- and online campaigns could become even more important during a pandemic. Those who can't access the internet are already marginalized, but they could become even more isolated without other measures to reach them.It's even worse in countries with state-owned media. Without rallies, opposition parties have even fewer ways to get their message out. \"Incumbents always have an advantage,\" said Sarah Repucci, the vice president of research and analysis for democracy non-governmental organization Freedom House. \"But they have a bigger advantage in an environment where it's difficult to get information out or get organized.\"Postponing an electionFaced with all those issues -- and the unfolding health crisis -- some countries have opted to postpone their elections.But this, too, comes with risks, say experts. That's because elections are necessary to keep the public's trust, and to maintain the legitimacy of lawmaking.In Australia's New South Wales, for instance, local government elections have been delayed by one year, meaning mayors and local councilors will stay in power for 12 more months. Sri Lanka has yet to announce a new date after calling off a parliamentary election set for April 25. The cancellation has left the island in a constitutional predicament -- parliament had already been dissolved ahead of the election date, so technically the country has no parliament.Democracy has taken a detour this century. Can it get back on track? Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya has said he will pick a new date in May. Repucci said rescheduling is vital to retain public trust in the process. She said any decision to delay an election should be done with cross-party support, to avoid situations where leaders are making unilateral decisions to extend their terms.And when countries do eventually hold their elections, they should make sure remote voting is available for everyone, but also allow some sanitary, in-person polling stations, Repucci said. \"Democracy has survived through many different kinds of environments,\" she said. \"It's going to look different, but that doesn't mean it can't have the same fundamental components that are so important to a democracy.\"A slide into authoritarianismElections are only one part of a functioning democracy. In some countries, leaders have taken on extraordinary powers to allow them to restrict freedoms so they can control the deadly spread of the virus.In New Zealand, the government has declared a state of emergency for only the second time in the country's history, giving the government sweeping powers including the authority to close roads, evacuate any premises, and exclude people from any place. But it also set up a special committee led by the leader of the main opposition party to allow them to scrutinize the government's coronavirus response in the absence of a sitting parliament. Hungary's parliament, by contrast, voted to allow the country's far-right Prime Minister Viktor Orban to rule by decree indefinitely in order to combat the pandemic, prompting concern that the move could be a power grab.Power-hungry leaders are itching to exploit the coronavirus crisisTo Repucci, this is reminiscent of the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, when countries around the world pushed through restrictions as part of their fight against terrorism. At the time, the rules played on people's fears -- but in many countries, the rules were never reversed. One example of this is the Patriot Act in the US, which was brought in following 9/11 and gave the government broader surveillance powers. \"We are already seeing (leaders) using the pandemic as an excuse to consolidate their role and to put measures in place that are there indefinitely and would be very, very hard to reverse,\" she said.Both Repucci and James say that the real test will be after the pandemic is over.\"Will the president return those powers back to legislatures or will they try to hang onto them?\" James questioned. \"It's very early to tell -- what we do know is that this will be a huge test for democracies around the world.\"For South Korea, the first test is Wednesday. While election campaigns in the country tend to be colorful affairs, featuring K-pop style dance troupes and quirky outfits, this election season has been more sedate. As they campaigned in Seoul, candidates wore gloves and face masks -- one even wore a face visor.But while it's a different atmosphere, constituents such as 49-year-old construction worker Cho Seung-chul have every intention of voting on Wednesday.\"Many people are concerned because of the coronavirus,\" he said. \"I think this situation makes it more important for me to exercise my right to vote.\" Journalist Iqbal Athas contributed reporting from Colombo, Sri Lanka.",

        "content": "(CNN)Last month, researchers in one of India's largest cities made a surprising discovery. Of the nearly 7,000 blood samples taken from people in Mumbai's slums, 57% tested positive for coronavirus antibodies.While some were alarmed by the results of the study conducted by the Mumbai authorities and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, others were optimistic. Mumbai's slums, where social distancing is nearly impossible, might now have some of the highest levels of immunity in the world -- only 23.5% of samples taken by India's National Center for Disease Control tested positive for antibodies in Delhi and 14% tested positive in New York, in a study sponsored by the New York State Department of Health.A health worker screens people for Covid-19 symptoms at Dharavi, one of Asia's biggest slums, in Mumbai, India. Scientists believe it's likely that recovering from coronavirus leaves a person with some immunity, but it's not clear how strong it is or how long it lasts. Herd immunity is the idea that a disease will stop spreading once enough of a population becomes immune -- and is appealing because, in theory, it might provide some protection for those who haven't been ill.If more than half of people in Mumbai's slums had contracted coronavirus, could they be approaching herd immunity -- without a vaccine? One expert thought so. Read More\"Mumbai's slums may have reached herd immunity,\" Jayaprakash Muliyil, chairman of the Scientific Advisory Committee of India's National Institute of Epidemiology, said, according to a Bloomberg report. \"If people in Mumbai want a safe place to avoid infection, they should probably go there.\"India now has more than 2 million confirmed coronavirus casesBut others have been more cautious. David Dowdy, an associate professor in epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said it was possible that the researchers had used a test that created false positives. And Om Shrivastav, an infectious diseases expert in Mumbai, cautioned that, less than eight months into the virus' existence in society, it was too early to make any \"decisive, conclusive statements.\" If Mumbai's slums are on the brink of herd immunity, it has come at a cost. Of India's more than 2 million coronavirus cases, about 5% of those infections were reported in Mumbai, the country's commercial capital. As of Monday, more than 6,940 people had died in the city, according to the city's health authorities. The risk of a high death toll is exactly why India's health authorities say the country is not aiming for herd immunity. \"Herd immunity can be achieved through immunization -- but that is in future,\" health official Rajesh Bhushan told reporters last month.What is herd immunity?Herd immunity works like this: Assume that each infected person infects three more people. If two of those three people are immune, then the virus is only able to make one person sick. This mean that fewer people are infected by the illness -- and over time, even people who aren't immune end up being protected as they are less likely to be exposed to the virus.Migrant workers gather outside Dharavi slums to board a bus during a nationwide lockdown on May 12, 2020. The level of immunity needed in a population depends on the disease. Scientists don't yet know what proportion of a population needs to be immune to achieve herd immunity for the novel coronavirus.Currently, scientists believe that each person infected with coronavirus infects between 2 to 2.5 people, according to the World Health Organization. But that number can be affected by other measures -- a lockdown, for instance, could bring down the number of people that each person with coronavirus infects. It's hard to know what the threshold is for herd immunity. Initially, some estimates put the figure at 70% to 90%. Adam Kleczkowski, a professor in mathematics and statistics at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, calculates it at 50% to 75%, based on what scientists know about how the virus transmits. With measles, for instance, researchers at the start of the 20th century noticed that infections declined when 68% of children had immunity. But Dowdy points out that measles outbreaks in areas where people are opting not to get vaccinated against measles shows how immunity can be lost.Building up the level of immunity in a population can happen in two ways. People can become immune by being vaccinated, or they catch the virus and develop natural immunity by recovering from it.And that's where things get controversial.Medical volunteers wearing PPE gear take temperature reading of a woman as they conduct a door-to-door medical screening inside Dharavi slums in Mumbai on July 9, 2020. The United Kingdom initially said that it would allow the spread of coronavirus within the country to build up to herd immunity. That approach came under fire, with critics warning that it would come at a heavy price: overburdened health systems and unnecessarily high death tolls. The UK -- which backtracked on its herd immunity strategy -- now has more confirmed coronavirus deaths than most countries. Of the 20 countries most affected by coronavirus, the UK has the highest mortality rate, with 69.63 deaths per 100,000 compared to the US' 52.28, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Most other countries -- including India -- have taken a different approach. \"Herd immunity in a country with the size of population of India cannot be a strategic choice, it can only be an outcome and that, too, at a very high cost,\" said the health official, Bhushan.As Dowdy puts it: \"We could very rapidly develop a population immunity to the coronavirus simply by exposing every single person in the population to the disease ... it's just that millions and millions of people are going to die in the process.\"A medical personnel collects a blood sample from a man in India. Can we build natural immunity?The science around immunity to Covid-19 is still developing.A paper released last month -- which has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed medical journal -- found that antibody responses may start to decline 20 to 30 days after Covid-19 symptoms emerge. The fact that antibody levels decline over time doesn't necessarily mean that immunity doesn't last, Dowdy says. In other viruses, antibody levels decline over time, too, but the immune response is still able to ramp up again if a person is re-exposed to the virus. According to Dowdy, our immunity to other coronaviruses tends to last a few years, rather than being life-long. \"If those are a guide, then that's what we might expect from this new coronavirus,\" he said. \"But it's hard to say. We don't have any data on this particular virus.\"Antibodies are only one part of the body's immune system -- there are also T cells, which help protect the body from infection, and B cells, which produce the antibodies. \"It is a well co-ordinated orchestra,\" said Anthony Tanoto, a senior research fellow at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore, who worked on research into T cells in Covid-19 patients. JUST WATCHEDSpain's new Covid-19 study is bad news for herd immunity advocatesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSpain's new Covid-19 study is bad news for herd immunity advocates 02:18In a paper published in science journal Nature in July, Tanoto and his co-authors found evidence of T cells from people who had recovered from SARS -- a coronavirus which spread in 2003 -- indicating that the cells can last for at least 17 years.The common cold is a coronavirus and scientists believe that almost everyone has been infected with a coronavirus in their lifetime. That could mean that many people have T cells that might respond to Covid-19.But for now, Tanoto says we don't know how much -- if at all -- these T cells are helping fight off Covid. In reality, once there is herd immunity -- whether naturally or through vaccines -- it probably won't be the impenetrable shield some people might imagine.  Tanoto's co-author Nina Le Bert, a senior research fellow at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore, points out that it's rare to have complete immunity from infection. Instead, immunity often means that a person's body is able to respond fast enough to the virus so that it doesn't gain a foothold -- and doesn't develop enough to infect other people.\"That will be good enough, but that doesn't mean you don't get infected,\" Le Bert said. What does this mean for herd immunity?Even if certain areas do achieve herd immunity, it might not last.The virus could mutate, meaning people who previously had immunity are no longer immune to the new version of the virus, or a person's immunity to the virus might not last long, according to Kleczkowski, from the University of Strathclyde.\"Even if we reach herd immunity at some point in time, we might lose it again,\" he said. \"I don't think it's a silver bullet.\"Dowdy says that herd immunity \"isn't a magic number\" to solve coronavirus.\"It doesn't mean that the disease is going to go away. It means that if you gave it 1,000 years, it would go away.\"JUST WATCHEDSweden releases early results of 'herd immunity' strategyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSweden releases early results of 'herd immunity' strategy 03:21And he notes that how long herd immunity lasts -- whether it's in a slum or a whole country -- partly depends on how much movement there is in and out of that population. If people without immunity come into the area, that lowers the population's overall level of immunity. If enough people come in, that could mean that there are enough people without immunity for the virus to spread again. In a Mumbai slum, for instance, people are likely to be coming and going, which could impact how long herd immunity -- if there is any -- lasts. Utture Shankar, the president of the Maharashtra Medical Council, said people outside slum areas were dependent on those living in slums for services such as gardening, cleaning and driving, so will be exposed beyond their residential community. In 10 years' time, Kleczkowski expects that some places in the world will still have coronavirus. Even if there is herd immunity in some places, there may still be an issue with the virus resurfacing, especially if people refuse to get vaccinated. He points out that, although humans have had vaccines for 200 years, we have only successfully eradicated one disease affecting humans -- small pox, thanks to a global vaccination program led by the World Health Organization. But it took a long time. A vaccine was discovered in the late 18th century, but smallpox was only officially declared eradicated in 1979. When it comes to coronavirus, vaccines are the key to herd immunity -- and controlling the virus, Dowdy says.\"I think this is a disease that's going to be with us for a while,\" he said. \"But I don't think it's going to be a disease that causes the same level of deaths and suffering as it is right now.\"CNN's Esha Mitra contributed to this story from New Delhi.",

        "content": "Queenstown, New Zealand (CNN Business)In Queenstown \u2014 a picturesque ski spot that often attracts comparisons to Aspen, Colorado \u2014 rumors about foreigners investing in apocalypse-proof bunkers have been swirling for years. They're referenced by local real estate agents: One recent listing advertised a house as a \"billionaire bunker\" for someone on a budget, for example. And there's even a local bar called The Bunker, a seemingly tongue-in-cheek reference to the bulletproof boltholes. Queenstown residents are skeptical about whether the secret, underground hideaways are actually as prevalent as such allusions would suggest. Unlike in the United States or Europe, where bunkers are frequently photographed and written about, there's scant evidence to prove that any bunkers have actually been installed. A property near Queenstown, New Zealand, designed by Mason & Wales Architects. But the New Zealand resort town's reputation as a place where the world's wealthy might prefer to ride out the end times isn't entirely undue.For years, Queenstown has been an attractive destination for elite foreigners who may have reason to seek out a metaphorical bunker, safe from major political turmoil thousands of miles away. Notable US-based homebuyers include Silicon Valley billionaire and political firebrand Peter Thiel and disgraced former NBC News anchor Matt Lauer.Read MoreNow that the coronavirus pandemic has wreaked havoc worldwide, Queenstown is once again sparking interest as the perfect place to escape catastrophe \u2014 with or without a secret bunker.A floor plan of one of Rising S' bunkers. A secretive bunker market\"We don't sell fear. We sell preparedness.\" That's the claim American bunker builder Rising S makes on its website, where it advertises \"preparedness\" as mini-compounds that can feature functioning kitchens, restrooms, solar-powered electricity and surveillance \u2014 starting from around $39,500 and running into the millions.Billionaire bunkers: How the 1% are preparing for the apocalypse\"Everybody wants their own personal touch to it, just like building a house,\" said general manager Gary Lynch, adding that the company has sold approximately 1,400 bunkers in its 18-year history. \"They're looking for something to protect their families, something that's self sufficient, something that they can live in for a prolonged period of time.\"This year alone, Lynch expects to sell around a dozen bunkers to New Zealand -- which would double the firm's total sales ever in the country, which have mainly been to American buyers. Traditionally, the New Zealand market makes up a tiny fraction of his clients, but there was an uptick in interest in 2017 and 2018, he said. \"There were a lot of people that were buying land and putting bunkers\" below ground, he said. Lynch says he won't show CNN Business a bunker because his clients' privacy is paramount. He doesn't want to go into specifics because it brings \"scam artists\" into the industry, who he says think they can build bunkers for cheaper. When asked where the bunkers are in New Zealand, he claims they are \"all over\" the place. But he also says he's had some difficulty getting bunkers into the country \u2014 though he was secretive about why that is and where exactly he regularly ships them to, joking that he almost needs to enlist American magician David Copperfield to help him.A floor plan of a Rising S bunker. \"The amount of exposure that we gained through the media, through the interest in shelters going to New Zealand, has made it incredibly hard for me to keep using the same methods that I did before to get shelters to New Zealand,\" he said. As for whether Lynch gets permits from local authorities to install the bunkers underground, he said: \"We're supposed to, yes. I don't encourage anyone to do anything that goes against the rules.\"   Rising S Company offers several high-end models, including the Aristocrat, which is priced at $8.35 million. The design incorporates a game room, bowling alley, gun range, garage, and pool.\nLynch isn't the only bunker maker who is cryptic about the business. Bloomberg reported earlier this year that California-based Vivos claimed it had installed a 300-person bunker in New Zealand. But when asked by CNN Business about his company's dealings in June, founder Robert Vicino was reluctant to elaborate.\"Inquiries from New Zealand are up significantly as they are from the rest of the world,\" Vicino said. \"For security reasons we cannot comment on any Vivos bunkers in New Zealand.\"A town for the wealthyOn paper, Queenstown \u2014 and New Zealand more broadly \u2014 makes an attractive housing market for foreigners, even without secretive bunkers.In the town of 40,000 people, more than 25% of private dwellings are unoccupied. Queenstown often ranks as among the most popular places in New Zealand for foreign buyers. In the first quarter of this year, 4.1% of properties were transferred to buyers who didn't hold New Zealand citizenship or resident visas. In recent years, around 10% of sales in the region have gone to foreign buyers.New Zealand does not have a foreign property register, meaning there is no official data on the total number of properties in New Zealand held by foreigners, or where foreign property owners are from.The country has made it more difficult in recent years for non-New Zealand citizens to buy residential property, in a bid to bring down an overheated market and make property more accessible for local first-home buyers.Yet there are ways around the rules, say experts, as long as foreigners can pass a rigorous approval process and show they can provide benefits to New Zealand, such as helping protect the local flora and fauna. US interest in immigrating to New Zealand seems to be particularly strong: The number of Americans who registered interest on Immigration New Zealand's website in May was nearly 66% higher than the same month a year prior.     But ask someone in Queenstown if they've seen a bunker, and you're more likely to get a laugh than a lead. \"Certainly, I've been in several of these people's houses and I've never (seen one),\" Queenstown businessman and philanthropist Eion Edgar said from his lakeside mansion, where work by high-profile New Zealand artists hangs on the walls. \"Look, it may be the new trend, but I would be surprised.\"'CyberHouse': The post-apocalypse bunker of choice for Tesla fans\"To be honest, it makes me laugh, because I'm not aware of any bunkers,\" said Queenstown's mayor Jim Boult from his office. \"It is arguably the most beautiful place in the world, so I understand their desire, but I'm not aware of any bunkers.\"Real estate agents, builders and architects all had a similar response. Queenstown lawyer Graeme Todd, who specializes in overseas property transactions and resource management law, says if bunkers were being installed, he would have heard about it. The most bunker-like thing he's ever seen is a wine cellar. \"Frankly, I think it's a marketing [move].\"\"I think it's a good story,\" said Hamish Muir, an architect director at local firm Mason and Wales Architect, before adding, definitively: \"They don't exist.\"After all, if Rising S were importing steel bunkers from the US, some people would likely know about it. Especially if, as Lynch says, the bunkers are being shipped fully constructed. They would need to come through the border, and then be transported to the installation site. Once there, the council would need to consent to their installation, and a landscaper or builder would need to dig meters into the earth to install the bunker.But there's no sign of any of that. A general view of the lake front on June 25, 2020 in Queenstown, New Zealand. Customs New Zealand said it had done an \"extensive search\" of its online information systems for imports from Rising S and had \"no record of any dealings with a company of that name.\" KiwiRail, one of New Zealand's biggest freight companies, said it couldn't release details of its rail freight or ship cargo \"due to customer privacy considerations.\"The Queenstown Lakes District Council, meanwhile, said it had not had any resource consent applications \u2014 which are necessary for earthworks and building \u2014 for bunkers or similar projects over the past five years. \"This doesn't appear to be something we're currently actively investigating,\" the council said in a statement.Eight other South Island district councils all said the same, with varying degrees of incredulity.\"We may be a relatively underpopulated country,\" said Chris Choat, a spokesman for Tasman District Council, which represents a region on the west coast of the South Island where a Rising S bunker was installed years ago, according to a Bloomberg report. \"But in saying that, communities know what is happening in their backyard.\" The truth about bunkersEven so, there may be some elements of truth to the bunker idea.According to Muir, the architect, a huge number of the properties he's worked on have a subterranean elements. But that is less to do with escaping disaster, and more to do with meeting height restrictions imposed by authorities to maintain the town's aesthetics.

Luxury real estate agent Bas Smith gave the example of a 25 million New Zealand dollar ($16 million) property at Wyuna Preserve \u2014 an exclusive, picturesque development out of Queenstown \u2014 which has a 600-square-meter basement that includes a cinema. It's not a bunker, per se, but it could be seen as that, he says. Many people who spoke with CNN Business pointed out that New Zealand is a place where an underground bunker isn't exactly necessary. Here, volcanoes and earthquakes pose a much greater danger than nuclear war or civil unrest. The idea of a bunker in New Zealand is \"more a metaphor for a safe haven -\u2014 choosing a place which has a safe government, a safe economy,\" Smith said. \"And it's a long way from everywhere.\"Terry Spice, a luxury real estate specialist in Arrowtown, a scenic town near Queenstown, says he's seen a surge in interest from people who want their own \"safe haven ticket.\" Smith says he gets 70 inquiries a day from people overseas. \"None of these guys that I deal with say they're preparing for the end of the world. They say things like, In times of geopolitical pressure, New Zealand is a cool place to be because it's farther away.The coronavirus pandemic may be proof of that concept, in a way.A property near Queenstown, New Zealand, designed by Mason & Wales Architects. Multiple residents of the Queenstown area said that Americans who didn't normally live there spent New Zealand's coronavirus lockdown in town. Queenstown Airport records show that at least two private jets landed while the country was under strict lockdown, though it isn't clear where they arrived from.New Zealand's tough approach to dealing with the coronavirus means that it frequently has days where it reports no new cases. The United States \u2014 which was slower to act against the coronavirus \u2014 continues to report thousands of new coronavirus cases each day. David Hiatt, who runs a helicopter operator in Queenstown called the Alpine Group, said \"without a doubt\" wealthy Americans were riding out coronavirus in Queenstown. \"Local operators are grateful to the fact that some of them are here,\" he said.     Trickle down effect?Not everyone wants more wealthy Americans in the country.In April, prominent New Zealand businessman Rod Drury called on the government to allow foreigners to buy luxury holiday homes to help stimulate the economy. Todd, the lawyer, also took an idea to allow foreigners to buy property over a certain value to two government ministers, but was stone-walled, he says.In Queenstown, many people see the rich Americans who have bought property as big contributors to the community. \"The good thing about wealthy people is that they spend money,\" said Edgar \u2014 they build houses and then often contribute money to local projects.A property near Queenstown, New Zealand, designed by Mason & Wales Architects. That's not how the government sees it. \"That philosophy has existed in New Zealand for a number of years, and it has never been one I have subscribed to or believe actually achieves what people claims it does,\" New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, told media in April after Drury's proposal. Ardern, who campaigned on banning foreign home buyers, has repeatedly blamed overseas speculators for pushing up housing prices, pricing New Zealanders out of the market. As the pandemic swept the world, Ardern's Housing Minister David Parker tightened rules even further to protect \"key assets\" from being bought by foreigners.  New Zealand has an election coming up in September.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern during a visit to Cardrona Alpine Resort on June 26, 2020 in Cardrona, New Zealand, as the town's ski season opened to the public. Some see changing the rules around foreign ownership as a way to capitalize on New Zealand's remoteness and its positive media attention over the way it has handled coronavirus. Opponents, like Ardern, don't see the benefits for New Zealanders. In Happiness House, a modest house that serves as a social welfare center for the community, manager Robyn Francis has seen the effects of foreign ownership first hand. Before the coronavirus pandemic, Queenstown properties sat empty for much of the year, while renters had to roomshare and some long-term residents left town over high rents. According to local media, Queenstown was the most expensive place to rent in New Zealand, with the average rents higher than take-home pay for a minimum-wage earner. \"It was unachievable for most Kiwis to live here,\" she said. \"There was a housing crisis because a lot of those houses were sitting empty.\"Francis doesn't want a return to the old rules, which she says contributed to the lack of affordable housing, making property \"exclusive.\" Ultimately, many will be hoping that foreign boltholes \u2014 be they bunkers or not \u2014 don't come at the cost of New Zealanders' own safe haven.",

        "content": "(CNN)They thought they were going to New Zealand to make better lives for their families.They were told they would leave Samoa -- a small island nation in the South Pacific -- for their larger neighbor, a country with about 25 times the population. Once there, they would work and send the money back home to their loved ones.Instead, when they arrived in New Zealand, the 13 victims -- who cannot be named due to a court suppression order -- were confronted with an entirely different situation, legal records show. Their passports were taken from them. They were kept on a property surrounded by a high wire fence and could only leave or communicate with their family with permission. If they broke the rules, they were assaulted, sometimes so badly that it resulted in scars. When one teenage victim escaped, she was brought back in a car with her hands and wrists tied, Radio New Zealand reported.Most worked long hours picking fruits from orchards, but they didn't receive the money they had earned. Instead, it was given to the man who had either directly or indirectly lured them to New Zealand: a Samoan chief named Joseph Auga Matamata. Joseph Matamata has been sentenced for 11 years in prison for slavery and human trafficking. Read MoreOn Monday, Matamata was sentenced to 11 years in jail for 10 counts of human trafficking and 13 counts of dealing in slaves -- the first case in New Zealand where a person has been convicted of both human trafficking and slavery at the same time. He was also ordered to pay 183,000 New Zealand dollars ($122,000) in reparations to his 13 victims to partly compensate them for the estimated 300,000 New Zealand dollars ($200,000) his family gained from his criminal acts. Matamata has maintained his innocence. But while Matamata's sentence brings to a close more than two decades of offending, experts say that his case is just the tip of the iceberg. They say that although human trafficking and slavery convictions are rare in New Zealand, cases are more widespread than those convictions suggest. And they warn that more people could become vulnerable to trafficking in the post-pandemic world.A position of trustAs a matai -- or chief -- Matamata had a position of authority. In Samoan culture, the matai -- the person who holds the family chief title -- commands significant respect. But, according to sentencing judge Justice Helen Cull, Matamata abused that trust.Starting in 1994, Matamata began inviting family members or people from his village in Samoa to come to New Zealand to work and live at his property in Hastings, a city on New Zealand's North Island where there are a number of orchards and wineries. All were poorly educated, most could not speak English and some could not read. The first victims were a brother and sister aged 17 and 15 at the time. The brother expected to earn money to send home to his family, while his sister expected to finish her education in New Zealand.Instead, the brother worked long days on orchards while the sister cooked, cleaned and helped with childcare -- and neither were paid for their work. Matamata restricted their movements and physically abused them.The other 11 victims -- who were aged between 12 and 53 at the time they came to New Zealand -- had similar experiences, according to the judgment.In many of the cases, Matamata organized three-month visitor visas for the victims, rather than the employment visas they would need to work legally. The victims were told not to leave the property without permission, and not to communicate with their families  in Samoa unless Matamata permitted it. They were not to communicate with passersby or connect with other people at weekly church services. If they didn't comply, Matamata \"assaulted them and created a climate of fear and intimidation,\" Justice Cull said. Matamata contracted all -- except for the 15-year-old sister -- out to horticulture operators, but then pocketed the money they earned for himself. One was given as little as 10 New Zealand dollars ($7) a week. Another received 850 New Zealand dollars ($565) for more than 17 months' work.Eventually, many of the victims were deported to Samoa as they had not been on the correct visa. The UK has thousands of people in modern slavery -- and in London it's getting increasingly worseWhen they returned home, many felt a sense of shame as they had \"nothing to show for their time away and were criminalized for their illegal immigration status,\" Justice Cull said in her sentencing notes, adding that shame was made worse because of Matamata's chiefly status.\"They cannot return to New Zealand for work and many feel this stigma and history will limit their ability to work ... for the rest of their lives,\" she said, noting that in many cases, coming to New Zealand had worsened their families' financial situation. \"Some of the victims are hopeful for their future but many still feel a lot of guilt and pain for what occurred to them at (Matamata's) hands.\"In a statement following the sentencing, Immigration New Zealand general manager of verification and compliance, Stephen Vaughan, said the sentence recognized that Matamata's offending went \"against all basic human decency.\"\"His breaches of trust, physical abuse, and blatant disregard for the well-being of people he was purporting to help were unconscionable and must be condemned,\" Vaughan said.New Zealand and human traffickingFor a long time, there's been a perception that human trafficking and slavery don't take place in New Zealand, says Natalia Szablewska, a senior lecturer at Auckland University of Technology law school who is an expert on human trafficking.Human trafficking was only added to the country's Crimes Act in 2002, and as recently as 2010, the head of immigration said there was no evidence of human trafficking in New Zealand, according to a paper by one of the country's top judges. But it was only after New Zealand broadened its definition of human trafficking in 2015 to include domestic trafficking, meaning it doesn't need to be cross-border, that the country had its first ever human trafficking conviction. In 2016, a man named Faroz Ali was found guilty of trafficking Fijian workers into the country. Experts say that the low number of convictions don't capture the whole picture. According to non-profit Walk Free Foundation's Global Slavery Index, which is based on estimates using surveys, there are more than 40 million victims of modern slavery around the world -- and 3,000 victims in New Zealand.As with all countries, it's hard to gather accurate statistics due to the hidden nature of the crime. Matamata's case was only bought to the attention of authorities in 2017, according to Immigration New Zealand, and court documents said most victims were too ashamed to speak about their experiences even after they returned to Samoa. JUST WATCHEDTackling human trafficking in the USReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTackling human trafficking in the US 01:39Detective Inspector Mike Foster said the case -- which required help from Samoan authorities -- was one of the most complex joint investigations between Immigration New Zealand and the police. But while we don't know the true extent, research shows exploitation is happening.A report by two academics published in 2019 found that people in New Zealand on student visas or employer-assisted visas were most vulnerable to exploitation. Some interviewees from India said education agents had sold them \"a dream\" of permanent residency in New Zealand. Some borrowed heavily to get to New Zealand, and became so desperate when they couldn't find legitimate work that they accepted exploitative conditions. The majority of the 64 migrant workers interviewed as part of the study had been underpaid in at least one of their jobs, with some wages as low as 3 New Zealand dollars ($2) an hour -- well under New Zealand's minimum wage.So if there's more cases, why aren't more people coming forward?One reason, according to Rebekah Armstrong, the director of New Zealand-based Business and Human Rights Consultants, is that victims are often terrified that if they complain, they will lose their visa status -- and potentially their pathway to residency. In New Zealand, immigration and labor issues are handled by the same ministry -- and Armstrong thinks that may be putting some victims off reporting abuse.In a 2016 report, a migrant worker interviewee was quoted as saying: \"I feel like they (the employer) own me because of visas.\"What New Zealand should doWith millions around the world losing their jobs as a result of the coronavirus, experts warn that could make more people vulnerable to trafficking -- including in New Zealand. \"Once they are desperate, (people) will go for so-called opportunities where what you are asked to do or the way you are asked to do it is pretty unfair and below labor standards,\" Szablewska said. \"Those who have been vulnerable will become even more vulnerable.\"What is #MyFreedomDay?Gary Jones, the manager of trade policy and strategy for industry group New Zealand Apples and Pears, said that the 350,000 migrant workers currently in New Zealand could become vulnerable to exploitation if their work dries up. The current climate is also worrying the government. On Monday, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment said the government would invest 50 million New Zealand dollars ($33.2 million) to reduce the risk of exploitation occurring, which it said was increasing as a result of Covid-19. Those changes include establishing a new visa to help migrants leave exploitative situations and increasing the number of immigration investigators. But Szablewska wants New Zealand to follow in the footsteps of other countries like Australia by introducing a Modern Slavery Act that requires businesses to do due diligence on their own supply chain. New Zealand businesses operating in Australia that have a turnover over a certain threshold are also subject to the rules. Szablewska thinks that a Modern Slavery Act would help raise awareness about the issue in New Zealand -- and perhaps encourage more victims to come forward.\"I don't think most businesses in most cases want to rely on forced labor,\" she said.Jones thinks that commercial pressures can be more effective than legal changes.New Zealand Apples and Pears, for instance, have adopted an international framework where businesses have to prove they are treating workers well in order to get their products in overseas supermarkets. If they don't meet the criteria, their products won't be stocked. That shift -- along with other changes such as a visa scheme brought in more than a decade ago that gives more protection to Pacific Islanders working in the horticulture industry -- makes it harder for people like Matamata to offend, said Jones. But it could still happen, he said.\"If you want to hide things, you can certainly hide things,\" he said.",

        "content": "Koodathai, India (CNN)For years, Jolly Joseph talked about how her house was cursed, neighbors said. Her mother-in-law apparently died from a mysterious illness. At least three of her close relatives suffered fatal heart attacks, and her two-year-old niece choked to death on a piece of food.But in October, Indian police presented a different theory. There was no mention of curses. Instead, they alleged, Joseph had poisoned each of them, one by one, and then covered up her crimes with lies that have only now started to unravel. Her full name is Joliyamma, but people call her Jolly for short. She lived in a pastel-pink three-story house in Koodathai, a small town of just 12,000 in the Kozhikode district of Kerala state in southern India. A photo of Jolly Joseph, who police say has confessed to killing six of her family members.The 47-year-old mother-of-two seemed every bit the upstanding citizen, neighbors said. Every day, she left home, telling people she was going to her job as a professor at the  prestigious National Institute of Technology Calicut (NIT) university about a half-hour away, according to police. She wore a neat saree, and in her spare time regularly went to church and helped her neighbors when they were sick. Read More\"Jolly seemed like a perfect woman to us,\" said 30-year-old Saidu NK, who lived next door to Joseph for over 20 years and who, like other South Indians, uses an abbreviation of his family names as his last name.\"We never had a shadow of doubt on Jolly until the very recent turn of events,\" said another neighbor whose name CNN agreed not to publish as she was afraid of repercussions from fellow residents for speaking out on the case, which is highly sensitive in Koodathai.A pastel pink house with a dark secretWhen Joseph moved into the area, she seemed friendly and kind, her neighbors said. It was 1997, and Joseph had just married Roy Thomas, the unemployed son of a popular local couple, neighbors said. She moved into Thomas's family home, a spacious property with an iron fence that stood out from the tangle of lush jungle around Koodathai. A little plaque on the gate bears the name \"Tom Thomas,\" Roy Thomas's father. The exterior of Jolly Joseph's house in Koodathai.Joseph often chatted with Saidu's family as she hung out the washing on the balcony, which was lined with ornate, white balustrades. \"She was very talkative and well-mannered,\" he said.\"Jolly was very loving,\" said the neighbor who CNN agreed not to name. \"She would be here if we needed anything or if someone fell ill.\" In the predominantly Muslim town, Joseph and her husband's family were some of the few Christians, according to 37-year-old Mohammed Bava, who lived next door and attended Roy Thomas and Joseph's wedding. She was a regular churchgoer, Bava said.The couple had been married for five years when tragedy struck. In 2002, Roy Thomas's 57-year-old mother Annamma Thomas died in circumstances that weren't explained, but because she had health issues, her death wasn't considered suspicious and there was no post mortem. In India, post mortems are only required if the death is unnatural or suspicious. They can be requested by the deceased person's family, but some Indians are reluctant to do so because of a cultural belief that autopsies are a desecration of the body.        After Annamma Thomas's death, the mood changed, said Bava, who at the time was so close with the Thomas family that they regularly cooked extra dinner so he had something to eat once he got home from work. \"There was no happiness in the house like how there used to be when (Annamma Thomas) was alive,\" said Bava. In 2008, Bava remembered hearing the sound of someone being violently ill next door. He said Joseph called him and calmly told him that Roy Thomas's 66-year-old father Tom Thomas wasn't well. When Bava got there, he said he found Tom Thomas lying flat on his back, foaming at the mouth. Bava took him to hospital where doctors declared him dead from a heart attack. According to Bava, Roy Thomas and Joseph inherited the property in Tom Thomas's will. Police investigations found that by the time of the elder Thomas's death, all his assets had been transferred to Joseph. \"Jolly seemed like a perfect woman to us.\" Saidu NK, neighborThree years later, 40-year-old Roy Thomas was dead, too. Again, Joseph called Bava, who said he found the man lying on the bathroom floor, foaming from the mouth. This time, Roy Thomas's uncle Mathew Manjadiyil insisted that Joseph's husband needed a post mortem and took him to the hospital. The post mortem found that Roy Thomas had died after consuming cyanide, a chemical commonly used in mining and jewelry-making which can be fatal in high doses. Police ruled it a suicide and didn't investigate further, according to Bava. But again, Joseph told others -- including Bava -- that it was a heart attack. \"It's a fact that the then-investigations didn't go into trying to find out from where he received the cyanide,\" Kozhikhode district police superintendent KG Simon said at a press conference in October.After that, Joseph grew more distant from the community, neighbors said. \"She wasn't that friendly or close to local people, but we didn't really mind it as we knew that she was a woman and a widow, too,\" said Biju Mon, who used to drive Joseph and Roy Thomas's eldest son to school.Saidu NK, one of Jolly Joseph's neighbors, at his house in Koodathai on October 25, 2019.More deaths followed. In 2014, Roy Thomas's 67-year-old uncle Manjadiyil died in Joseph's presence -- another heart attack, Joseph said, according to Bava. That same year, Alphine, the two-year-old daughter of Roy Thomas's cousin Shaju Sakhariyas, died after allegedly choking on food at a christening ceremony. Then, in 2016, Sakhariyas's 43-year-old wife Sili died, too. In 2017, a year after Sili Sakhariyas's death, Joseph remarried. Her new husband was Sili Sakhariyas's widower, Shaju Sakhariyas. Brewing suspicionsBy the time she remarried, people close to Joseph had begun to suspect something was wrong.After the death of Joseph's first husband in 2011, Bava said he saw a new version of Tom Thomas's will, which said that the family home should be transferred to Joseph. Suspicious about the changed will, Roy Thomas's brother Rojo Thomas began to look into the people who had witnessed it, Bava said. Rojo Thomas told Bava that, in the course of his investigations, he found Joseph didn't really work at NIT as she had claimed.\"The whole family attacked him. They were not ready to believe Rojo,\" said Bava. \"Such was the clout and image that Jolly had in the family -- they all thought that Rojo Thomas was saying this because he had an eye on the house and property.\"By 2017, Bava had doubts, too.      Rojo requested a copy of the post mortem conducted on Roy Thomas, and found a discrepancy in Joseph's story, according to Bava. Joseph told Bava that she was making her husband an omelet for dinner when he suddenly ran to the bathroom and collapsed. But according to the post mortem which Rojo Thomas shared with Bava, Roy Thomas had eaten a dinner of rice and chickpea curry the night he died. CNN has not been able to independently confirm the contents of the post mortem.When Rojo Thomas confronted Joseph about the inconsistencies, she stuck to her original story, according to Bava. The men became even more suspicious.So, Bava, Rojo Thomas and Rojo's sister Ranji Thomas began looking closely at all of the deaths themselves. In each case, they found a common link: Joseph had been present. Earlier this year, they complained to the district police, who forwarded their complaint to the Thamarassery Police Station in nearby Kozhikode. But Bava said they were told there was nothing to investigate because the post mortem listed suicide as Roy Thomas's cause of death. They complained again to the crime unit of the Kozhikode police -- and this time, police agreed there was a potential criminal case.Mohammed Bava, one of Jolly Joseph's neighbors, at his house in Koodathai on October 25, 2019.The unraveling of JollyPolice said they began to investigate in August, and they soon found holes in Joseph's stories, too.Like Rojo Thomas, police discovered Joseph wasn't really a professor at the NIT university as she had claimed. Although she had an identity card from the university, police found she had faked her role as a professor to get people's respect. NIT's registrar lieutenant colonel Pankajakshan K confirmed to CNN that Joseph had never worked there, although police investigations found she sometimes came to the campus and bought tea in the canteen.  Yet that wasn't the only strange thing police said they discovered about Joseph.They thought it odd that she told people Roy Thomas had died of a heart attack, when she knew the cause of death was suicide by cyanide. Altogether, authorities said they found about 50 discrepancies between her statements to police and other evidence. As there had been no post mortem done after any of the deaths besides Roy Thomas's, police ordered the bodies to be exhumed and tested.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJolly Joseph's family:A timeline\n\n\n\n\n1997\n\n\n\nJolly Joseph marries Roy Thomas and moves into her in-law's home in Koodathai.\n\n\n\n\n2002\n\n\n\nJoseph's mother-in-law Annamma Thomas dies after a mysterious illness.\n\n\n\n\n2008\n\n\n\nTom Thomas, Joseph's father-in-law, dies from an apparent heart attack. \n\n\n\n\n2011\n\n\n\nJoseph's husband, Roy Thomas, dies.

At an October 5 press conference crammed with Indian press, Kozhikhode district police superintendent KG Simon announced a major development.Joseph had confessed to murdering all six family members, Simon said, adding that she had poisoned them with cyanide to gain control over the family's assets -- and then marry the man she had her eye on.Police said Joseph poisoned her in-laws to get hold of the house -- and as her marriage to Roy Thomas worsened, Joseph killed him too. She then allegedly killed her husband's uncle Manjadiyil -- who had been most adamant that Roy Thomas needed to have a post mortem -- by mixing poison into an alcoholic drink, police documents show. She allegedly killed Sili Sakhariyas  and her daughter Alphine by poisoning their water and food, respectively, to get closer to Shaju Sakhariyas. \"Jolly told many people she wished for a husband like Shaju,\" Simon said. According to police documents, Joseph has been arrested for the alleged murder of Manjadiyil, Alphine and her father-in-law, Tom Thomas. The arrest came weeks before a man in another part of India was apprehended after allegedly confessing to killing 10 people by giving them cyanide-laced religious offerings or medicine and then stealing their cash, gold or silver.The other side of JollyNot much happens in Koodathai. The town is so green it looks as if it could be swallowed up by overgrown plants, and there's the smell of damp soil. Stray dogs roam around the main street sniffing at scraps. For the most part, people know what their neighbors get up to.But now, people are questioning what they really knew about Joseph.A shot taken on the outskirts of Koodathai, October 24, 2019.\"It's not a small thing to be able to deceive people with the fake identity of an NIT professor for 14 years,\" Simon said. And neighbors said they saw other things that seemed to contradict Joseph's perfect image.Although multiple people told CNN Joseph regularly went to the local Lourdes Matha Church, Reverend Joseph Kizhakkepurakkal disputed that. \"She is not even a member of this diocese. She came here after getting married,\" he said. \"Jolly was not a frequent visitor here, nor did she have anything to do with the activities of the church.\" Beyond Koodathai, the story has grabbed headlines in India where many are surprised that a woman is suspected of so many murders. \"It's not a small thing to be able to deceive people with the fake identity of an NIT professor for 14 years.\"Kozhikhode district police superintendent KG SimonAround the world, women are significantly more likely to be victims of murder, and significantly less likely to be perpetrators. India is no different: only 6.7% of people arrested for murder are female.   The proportion of female serial killers is even smaller. According to Amit Thakre, an assistant professor in Criminal Psychology at National Institute of Criminology and Forensic Science in New Delhi, male serial killers are much more common than females as a higher rate of men have psychopathic traits, where they lack the ability to empathize with others. \"We don't come across women serial killers too often,\" he said.Of course, it's yet to be proven if Joseph is one of them. Police say she's confessed to the crimes, but her lawyer, K Haider, says if she's charged with murder, she plans to plead not guilty. He didn't reply to questions about her planned defense. For now, the house that Joseph allegedly killed people to get control of is falling into disrepair. Moss creeps over the driveway and a lock hangs on the rusted gate. Joseph remains behind bars, as police continue their investigations. Under Indian law, suspects of serious crimes such as murder can be held for up to 90 days as part of the investigation process. She has not yet been charged. Police said they are continuing investigations and will go to trial once a consolidated charge sheet is filed. If Joseph is charged and convicted, she could face life in prison -- or even death. CNN's Julia Hollingsworth reported and wrote from Hong Kong.

        "content": "New Delhi, India (CNN)On a winter's day in 1985, a one-time Indian prince was killed by police in a bustling Rajasthan market.For decades, the police officers on duty and the former royal's relatives couldn't agree on what had happened that day to a man known for his fiery nature and political ambition. Raja Man Singh's family -- part of a centuries-old royal lineage -- claimed he had been killed in a premeditated murder plot ordered by the highest politician in the state. But police said they opened fire in self-defense, killing a hot-tempered man who thought himself above the law.For 35 years, no one was held accountable for Man Singh's death. Then, last month, after a protracted legal battle, 11 policemen were convicted of his murder and sentenced to life in prison. Dushyant Singh pictured next to a statue of his grandfather, Raja Man Singh.Read MoreHis family say it took them 1,700 court dates over 35 years to get justice. Because the trial took so long, all of the policemen convicted are now in their 60s or older, and four policemen who had been accused died before the verdict.But the fact there is any result at all is significant in India, where it is rare for police to be convicted over the killing of a member of the public -- a situation known in India as an \"encounter killing.\"And, as Man Singh's family points out, there might not have been any justice at all if it weren't for their royal lineage.The last of the royalsWhen Man Singh was born in 1921, the Indian subcontinent was still under British control.But only about two thirds of the population was directly ruled by the British Raj -- the other third was governed by about 600 local rulers who swore allegiance to the British crown. The \"princely states\" benefited the British Raj -- they reduced the administrative load as they ruled their own affairs and, by splintering the population, made it less likely that the Indian subjects would unify against them.      After India gained independence in 1947, these princely states were dismantled and the country became the world's biggest democracy. That included the princely state of Bharatpur, then under the rule of Man Singh's brother, Maharaja Brijendra.Royal families were allowed to keep their palaces, which many former rulers converted into magnificent hotels, according to Adnan Naseemullah, who teaches South Asian politics at King's College London. And up until 1971, the former royal families were paid a privy purse -- compensation from the central government for their loss of status. After independence, some former royals -- such as the Bharatpur royal family -- moved into politics. Sometimes, they did this to prevent their property from being transferred to peasants, or to the state, according to Naseemullah. By becoming involved in politics, they were able to turn their traditional authority into a modern, legal authority, said political scientist Vasundhara Sirnate. There's a sense of entitlement with which former royals went into the political process.\nVasundhara Sirnate, political scientist\"There's a sense of entitlement with which former royals went into the political process. They knew that if they lose an election... it hurts their traditional authority,\" she said.In the decades after independence, Man Singh proved himself an adept political force.By 1985, he had already won six consecutive legislative assembly elections in Rajasthan. He didn't promote a particular issue -- instead, he won every election by leveraging the maharaja's immense popularity, campaigning under the slogan \"Long Live Giriraj Maharaj,\" a reference to the royal family's deity of valor.In 1985, he was campaigning for his seventh term against a rival from the then-ruling Indian National Congress Party, which had pushed for independence from the British.The seventh campaign would be Man Singh's last. On February 19, Congress party members went to Man Singh's summer palace in Deeg, a town in Bharatpur, according to Vijay Singh, Man Singh's son-in-law. There, they pulled down a flag -- it's unclear what kind of flag it was -- and burned it.      The following day, the Chief Minister of Rajasthan, Shiv Charan Mathur, the highest elected official in the state, held a rally in support of Man Singh's opponent. Furious, Man Singh showed up at the rally, according to a 158-page judgment by a special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court handed down last month.He drove his military vehicle into the stage, then rammed into the helicopter that the chief minister had used to fly to the rally. The helicopter's windows were smashed and the chief minister had to return to Rajasthan's capital, Jaipur, by road. According to Vijay Singh, police made no attempt to arrest Man Singh after the incident, although a police report filed that day accused him of attempted murder. Man Singh continued with his electioneering, and even held a political address near a police station later that evening.At around midday the next day --  February 21 -- Man Singh, his son-in-law and other party members were on their way to a campaign meeting, according to the judgment. They were stopped by around 50 police officers in a crowded market. When Man Singh attempted to reverse his car, police opened fire, killing him, according to Vijay Singh's account to police.Self defence or murder?As police told it, they killed Man Singh in self-defense. When they got to the market to arrest him over the incident the previous day, his party members opened fire using improvised guns constructed from scrap material, known in India as \"country-made guns,\" police said.When one officer told them to surrender, police reports allege that Man Singh yelled back: \"Kill the scumbags,\" according to a translation from the Hindi judgment.Police claimed they were forced to fire, leaving Man Singh and two of his party members injured. After the chaos subsided, they took all three for treatment, according to the original police report.Left: An image of the late Raja Man Singh, who was born into a royal family in Bharatpur. Right: A young Raja Man Singh. Lawyers for police pointed to Man Singh's quick temper -- during the 1971 elections he rammed his car into his opponent's vehicle, and in 1973 he did the same to a police vehicle, snatching a weapon from an officer and brawling with police, according to police reports.   But Vijay Singh, who was almost hit by a bullet himself in the fatal shooting, said it wasn't self-defense -- it was murder.He claims that the chief minister of Rajasthan was furious that Man Singh damaged his helicopter and disrupted his rally. So he came up with a plan for revenge -- he ordered police to kill Man Singh.This was an open daylight murder in the middle of a busy market but they scared people into not speaking up.Vijay SinghAccording to Vijay Singh, the first bullet was fired by the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Kan Singh Bhati, who is now over 82 years old. Contrary to the police report, Vijay Singh says his father-in-law and his supporters died on the spot and weren't carrying weapons -- instead police planted evidence to make it look as if there had been a shoot-out. \"This was an open daylight murder in the middle of a busy market but they scared people into not speaking up,\" Vijay Singh told CNN last month. \"Why would a family with tens of licensed guns travel with a country gun, instead?\" In its court ruling last month, the CBI did not deal with Vijay Singh's claim that the chief minister -- who died in 2009 -- had ordered the killing. But it did side with Vijay Singh's version of events. The court found that the firing began on Bhati's orders. It ruled that Man Singh and his party members did not have any weapons on them -- and that they had died on the spot.\"The family and the public are both happy for this verdict and we welcome it,\" said Krishnendra Kaur, Man Singh's daughter.She added that she was glad that she and her two sisters were alive to see the result -- Man Singh's wife didn't live to see the outcome. CNN has sought comment from the CBI and Bharatpur police.Why the case took so longAfter Man Singh died, many people in Bharatpur were distraught. India's hundreds of princely states were governed differently -- and in many, there was no love lost between the commoners and their formal rulers, Naseemullah said. They were seen as \"stooges of the British Empire\" who were on the \"wrong side of history,\" he added.But in Bharatpur, many people loved the royal family. According to Vijay Singh, Man Singh worked his farms himself and was called a \"farmer among kings and a king among farmers,\" by his people. There was public goodwill towards the royal family, who had been kind to their people, Vijay Singh added.Durjan Sal Palace, Bharatpur.  Engraving from India, 1877, by Louis Rousselet.So when Man Singh died, hundreds of people from the town of Deeg attended his funeral. As they mourned, a curfew was put in place in Bharatpur to contain protests against the police, according to Vijay Singh. Three people died in the violence, according to Vijay Singh's testimony in court.Soon after Man Singh's death, Vijay Singh took his version of events to the police. On February 23, 1985, he filed an incident report, claiming that police had murdered his father-in-law. Initially, local police refused to record his complaint, he testified in court. So he complained to the superintendent of police who told the officers to register his report. All 18 policemen were charged over the murder in July that year. \"After the incident happened, the atmosphere in the town and in the district was volatile,\" Vijay Singh said.But court proceedings were delayed for decades, according to Narayan Singh, Man Singh's family lawyer.  The family petitioned to have the case transferred from Rajasthan to Mathura, in the neighboring state of Uttar Pradesh, fearing the local government could prevent a successful prosecution. In 1989, the Supreme Court transferred the case.But even then, they ran into lengthy delays.Deeg Palace in Bharatpur district, Rajasthan, India. Under Indian law, people can be charged collectively for a crime, meaning that the prosecution doesn't need to prove which one of the accused fired the fatal bullet, for instance. But if a legal petition -- such as an appeal -- is pending in a higher court for one of the individuals, the case for the collective cannot proceed at the local court level. A similar approach was used by the four men convicted of the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student on a New Delhi bus in 2012. In Man Singh's case, the petitions caused so many delays that 26 different judges ended up handling the case, Narayan Singh said. According to Narayan Singh, the court only began hearing evidence from the 61 prosecution witnesses in 1990, and that process alone took 18 years. It took another four years to question 17 defense witnesses, and another eight years to hear further arguments and petitions. \"The courts would get adjourned through different applications from the defense side and taking testimony of one witness could last as long as four months,\" Narayan Singh said. \"They (the defense) had 100 ways of delaying the hearings.\"According to Vijay Singh, each of the 18 accused would petition the high court at different times. \"The police definitely knew how to exploit the system to their benefit,\" he said. Wider problemAccording to lawyer Narayan Singh, it's uncommon for police to be convicted for killing a member of the public -- royal blood or not. The government doesn't release statistics on the total number of police convicted in such cases -- and even the number of \"encounter killings\" are unclear. There are no government statistics released on \"fake encounters\" -- a term for cases like Man Singh's where the \"encounter\" with police was staged.According to the most recent Crime in India report, released in 2018 by the National Crime Records Bureau, four \"encounter killings\" were registered in 2018. No arrests or convictions were made. A shrine in the town of Deeg, Rajasthan, which marks Raja Man Singh's \"place of martyrdom.\"However, 164 cases of deaths during police encounters were registered by the statutory public body National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) between April 2017 and March 2018. In total, 46 people died in encounters with police between January and July this year alone, according to the NHRC. Another 601 cases involving people dying in encounters with police are currently going through the courts.In the past few months, India has seen a few high-profile cases of deaths allegedly at the hands of police. In June, the death of gangster Vikas Dubey in a police shoot out sparked debate in India over extrajudicial killings. On July 22, the Supreme Court ordered an independent inquiry commission to examine the incident and submit a report to the court within two months.Last month, four police officers in Tamil Nadu were arrested for allegedly murdering a father and son, who were in custody at the time of their deaths. Those deaths renewed outrage in India over police brutality, with the men's family members, politicians and human rights activists alleging officers tortured the pair before they died.Hundreds of people attend a celebration in Bharatpur on July 23, 2020, the day after 11 policemen were sentenced to life in prison for Raj Man Singh's murder. Sirnate, the political scientist, says people in India often think that these sorts of killings only happen in places where there are insurgents. \"These are not happening on the peripheries of the country,\" she said of encounter killings. \"In the Bharatpur case, (it's happened) to a family that is extremely mainstream.\"Vijay Singh believes that the only reason a verdict was delivered in this case was because of Man Singh's influence -- if he hadn't have been so high profile, the government might not have felt pressure to continue the case. Even now, Man Singh's influence can be felt. Following his death, a shrine was built in the town of Deeg, considered by supporters to be his \"place of martyrdom.\" Every five years, hundreds gather for a prayer meeting to remember him, according to Dushyant Singh, Man Singh's grandson.On July 23, the day after the 11 policemen were sentenced to prison, hundreds gathered again -- this time around a statue of Man Singh near the family's palace in Bharatpur -- to celebrate the outcome, he said.And the day that the verdict was announced, around 100 police officials were stationed outside the Mathura court, to prevent riots if the verdict didn't side with the family's version of events. \"With the legacy of Raja Man Singh, it is only natural that people wanted to celebrate the verdict,\" Vijay Singh said.Esha Mitra reported from New Delhi, India.

        "content": "(CNN)There were families on holiday. A honeymooning couple. All there to see one thing: the uninhabited moonscape of New Zealand's most active volcano, White Island.It's a private island around 48 kilometers (30 miles) off the east coast of the country's North Island, and over 10,000 people visit the volcano each year. That's a tiny fragment of the millions of tourists who visited New Zealand in 2019, many of them drawn to the country's famous natural beauty and outdoor pursuits. But on Monday afternoon, tragedy struck. White Island erupted, killing at least six people and leaving over 20 fighting for their lives.     Scientists have said there were no indications that the volcano was going to erupt, even though volcanic activity was detected in recent weeks. The country's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said \"questions must be asked and they must be answered\" over the event. \"White Island has been a disaster waiting to happen for many years.\"Monash University volcanologist Raymond CasBut already, some are asking whether more steps could have been taken to keep tourists safe -- and even whether tourists should have been on the island at all.Read More\"White Island has been a disaster waiting to happen for many years,\" said Monash University volcanologist Raymond Cas, who has visited the volcano himself. \"I have always felt that it was too dangerous to allow the daily tour groups that visit the uninhabited island volcano by boat and helicopter.\"How New Zealand's warning system worksIn the weeks before the eruption, New Zealand volcano monitoring service GeoNet raised the alert level on White Island to level 2. New Zealand's volcanoes are rated from zero to five, with zero meaning that there is no volcanic unrest, while ratings from three to five mean there is an eruption taking place. A rating of two means that there is low level volcanic activity taking place. GNS said the current system had been in effect since 2014 following \"extensive engagement\" with stakeholders. \n\n\n\n\nGeoNet's ratings alert levels explain what the likely hazards are, but they don't tell visitors how to act and they don't carry any legal weight. Nor do they offer advice on what actions should be taken -- that's up to those who are visiting the volcano. In the weeks leading up to the eruption, GNS staff visited the island, GNS volcanologist Graham Leonard said. And there's another problem: volcanoes like White Island can erupt even if they are at level 1. White Island -- which is called Te Puia o Whakaari or \"the dramatic volcano\" in Maori -- is privately owned by the Whakaari Trust, and has been in the same family for 80 years after earlier mining operations on the island ended in bankruptcy. Tour operators and individual travelers who want to visit the island need to get permission from the private owners.On Monday, White Island Tours -- a company based in the nearby beach town of Whakatane -- took 38 tourists from countries around the world to the island on the day of the eruption. Under the company's internal guidelines, it could still take visitors to the island during an alert level 2, said Paul Quinn, the chairman of White Island Tours. In this image released by GeoNet, tourists can be seen on a trail near the volcano's crater Monday, Dec. 9, 2019, on White Island, New Zealand.\"There was nothing that signaled there was going to be an eruption,\" he said.New Zealand police said that 47 people were on the island at the time of eruption. It's believed that over 30 tourists were from the Ovation of the Seas cruise ship, which is owned by Royal Caribbean. Royal Caribbean did not reply to CNN's request for comment on what advice it gave tourists before they went to White Island. White Island Tours is able to set its own policies on whether it will still go to the island if there are signs of volcanic activity. But it doesn't have completely free reign. When the company makes its decisions, it also needs to comply with the country's health and safety standards, which are set by government regulator WorkSafe. Under New Zealand's laws, businesses need to ensure any health and safety risks are managed. \"There was nothing that signaled there was going to be an eruption.\"\nPaul Quinn, the chairman of White Island Tours. CNN asked WorkSafe whether tour groups were complying with health and safety standards by going to an active volcano with a level 2 rating. WorkSafe did not directly reply to CNN's questions. However, in a statement, it said it had opened a health and safety investigation into the loss of life caused by the eruption. \"WorkSafe will be investigating and considering all of the relevant work health and safety issues surrounding this tragic event,\" the statement said. On Tuesday, police said they were investigating the circumstances of the deaths and injuries on behalf of the country's coroner. They said it was too early to confirm whether there would also be a criminal investigation. An island nation on the ring of fireNew Zealand is a country renowned for its natural beauty -- it's a place with soaring, snow-covered mountains, bubbling thermal pools, and vast, clear lakes.New Zealand Tourism markets the country as an active, adventure holiday destination with magnificent landscapes that is \"jam-packed\" with things to do.But it's also a country that straddles two tectonic plates and is on what's known as the \"Ring of Fire\" -- a trail of volcanoes and earthquake-prone areas around the Pacific Ocean that follow the line of where tectonic plates collide. That's made it prone to volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, which in turn have helped create the land formations that the country is so renowned for.     The North Island's Lake Taupo was formed by a volcanic eruption nearly 2,000 years ago. Rotorua's natural hot pools are created by geothermal activity bubbling under the earth. The country's hilly capital, Wellington, is built on an active fault, and its largest city, Auckland, is home to approximately 50 volcanoes -- including some that lie dormant. Although New Zealand has experienced deadly eruptions and earthquakes -- most recently the 2011 Christchurch quake that killed 185 people -- there have been many events that have not been fatal.White Island is New Zealand's most active volcano, but the last fatal event on the island was around 100 years ago, when a crater wall collapsed, killing 10 miners.But for those living in New Zealand, volcanic activity and earthquakes are often a part of life. \"There are many parts of the world that have a similar kind of risk profile both in terms of volcanism and earthquakes -- it's just part of the world we live in,\" said Auckland University volcanologist Shane Cronin. \"(Up until now) I think we've been lucky.\"JUST WATCHEDFatal volcanic eruption in New Zealand caught on cameraReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFatal volcanic eruption in New Zealand caught on camera 00:43Could more be done?But while New Zealand has often been fortunate, Monday's eruption shows that when things go wrong, it can be devastating.That's left some people with questions over what can be done better to prevent similar tragedies in the future. Monday's eruption shows that volcanic monitoring isn't yet good enough to make experiences like visiting White Island risk free, said volcanologist Cronin. \"Until we get our monitoring systems -- and our understanding of these systems -- right, we probably need to look at whether those near-to-crater operations should carry on like they have been,\" he said.But another possible issue is the growth in tourism. In the past 30 years, tourism to White Island has increased steadily, said Peter Buttle, one of the directors of the Whakaari Trust which owns the island.Local officials said tours to White Island are crucial to the area's economy.The increase in tourism has, in turn, increased the risk of danger, according to Cronin. \"You're increasing your vulnerability by bringing people more frequently,\" he said.Flowers are laid at a makeshift memorial seen in front of cruise ship Ovation of the Seas, in Tauranga, New Zealand, Tuesday, December 10, 2019. He said that White Island is a \"pretty edgy place\" and it was important that New Zealand's risk of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions were clearly communicated to foreign visitors. But ultimately, Cronin thinks tourism is possible on active volcanoes -- he pointed to the flourishing tourism on another of New Zealand's active volcanoes, Mount Ruapehu. Whakatane mayor Judy Turner said White Island Tours had a great reputation for safety, and noted that tours during a level 2 alert had operated safely in the past. But Monash University's Cas has a different perspective.  He describes White Island as a place where people are immediately confronted with steam crater lakes and noxious gases -- an active volcano that can have unpredictable and unexpected eruptions, which is remote enough that it's hard to get people off quickly if there is a sudden eruption.To him, it seems \"obviously dangerous\" to have large numbers of people wandering around the crater. \"I just wouldn't recommend it,\" he said. \nCNN's Isaac Yee and Ben Westcott contributed to this story from Hong Kong.

        "content": "(CNN)In February 1964, an English boy band called the Beatles made its US television debut.Beatlemania, the intense fan frenzy directed towards the fab foursome, was gripping America and the group's performance at the Ed Sullivan Theater was punctuated by fervent screaming from the studio audience.In May 2019, over 55 years later, another band of foreigners played the same theater. The visual similarities were striking -- and intentional.The Korean newcomers sported the same style of slim-fit suits and floppy bowl cuts, emblazoned their name on their drum kit in the same font used by the Liverpudlian hitmakers, and even made their broadcast in black and white. Read MoreBut this wasn't the Beatles. It was BTS -- a seven-man South Korean mega-group which is quite possibly the biggest boy band in the world right now.      In April, BTS became only the third group in 50 years to have three number one albums on the Billboard 200 charts in less than 12 months, joining the ranks of The Beatles and The Monkees. The next month, BTS became the first group in Billboard history to spend five weeks at number one on the Billboard Artist 100 chart. Like the Beatles, BTS had traveled from another continent to perform for their enormous American fan base. But that the South Korean stars had managed to crack the American market was perhaps an even greater achievement. Most of BTS's songs are in Korean, the group only has one fluent English speaker, and they were selling Americans a distinctly Asian brand of sex appeal.   The K-pop band that couldSix years ago, when BTS released their music video debut \"No More Dream\" in June 2013, it wasn't obvious that they would be K-pop's breakout success story in America.The group, comprised of Kim Tae-hyung (better known as V), Jung Ho-seok (J-Hope), Kim Nam-joon (RM), Kim Seok-jin (Jin), Park Ji-min, Jeon Jung-kook, and Min Yoon-gi (Suga), presented itself as rebellious \"bad boys,\" sporting gold chains, bandannas and heavy black eyeliner. The aggressive, rap-heavy track urged young people not to be defined by their parents' aspirations.South Koreans, however, weren't blown away. The single debuted at number 84 on Korea's government-sponsored Gaon Music Chart. At the time, boy bands EXO, Big Bang and SHINee dominated the K-pop charts. And while those groups sometimes referenced hip-hop in their songs, they tended to have a more clean-cut image and sing pop songs about romance. In EXO's 2013 hit \"Wolf,\" for instance, the band members howl and compare themselves to an animal who has been tamed by an alluring woman. But BTS, who were then all aged between 15 and 20, had something else that set them apart: they had been developed by start-up label Big Hit Entertainment, not one of the big three record companies -- SM Entertainment, JYP Entertainment and YG Entertainment -- which formed in the late 1990s, when K-pop was starting to take off.   To dominate South Korea's ultra-competitive, $4.7 billion K-pop industry, those labels had established intense pop factories that found and developed talent to form money-making groups.     The labels auditioned thousands of idol hopefuls a year, often aged between 10 and 14, who would become trainees at so-called K-pop farms and take part in a grueling, full-time rigorous training program in dance, singing and even make-up. Eventually, the lucky ones were selected for a K-pop group and tied in to long contracts that restricted their personal lives and sentenced them to years of limited pay. They had to conform to the rigid world of K-pop, where members are given designated roles within a group, such as leader, dancer or \"visuals\" -- the eye-candy of the group.Like other idol groups, BTS were manufactured. But its upstart label Big Hit Entertainment had to do something different to break through.Wearing their hearts on their socialFrom the start, Big Hit Entertainment faced a challenge.Lacking the industry connections and big money of the industry giants, the label relied heavily on social media to promote the group.KNOW YOUR K-POP SLANGMaknae: Korean for \"the youngest.\" The maknae in a group is often treated protectively by older members.Golden Maknae: A nickname given to BTS's Jungkook -- the youngest member -- that celebrates his talent for singing, rapping and dancing.Hyung: Korean for \"older brother.\" To a maknae, all other members are \"hyungs.\"Visuals: A member whose role is being the eye-candy.Bias: Your favorite member of a group.Bias wrecker: The member of a group who makes you question your devotion to your bias.Stan: A massive fan of an idol or group, a word derived from rapper Eminem's song \"Stan,\" about an obsessive fan.BTS were one of the first K-pop groups on Twitter, says Michelle Cho, a professor of East Asian Studies at University of Toronto. The band also posted vlogs on YouTube and shared the minutiae of their lives on Korean livestreaming platforms AfreecaTV and V Live. In one clip, singer Jungkook makes instant ramen in a modest kitchen. Using tongs, he pulls a noodle to his mouth. \"It's perfect,\" he says. In the past 10 months, that V Live clip has been viewed over 7.6 million times.The internet is full of these kinds of mundane BTS moments: the members cuddling as they snooze, eating meals, sitting in taxis and pulling pranks on each other. They take a variety of forms -- casual posts, live-streamed video diaries, or produced episodes of their reality TV-like web show \"Run BTS!\" \"I think that for some people it's quite alienating to encounter other K-pop (groups) ... that they know are a product of this very rigorous training system that (they believe) makes them a bit less authentic,\" Cho said. \"BTS are quite different because their whole concept from their inception was that they were going to be honest purveyors of the experience of youth.\"The videos build up seemingly authentic characters for the members: V is the quirky one, Jimin the flirty one, Jungkook the supernaturally talented youngest member. J-Hope is high-energy, Suga the brooding musician, Jin the handsome one, who often reveals himself as a pun-loving dork. And RM, the preternaturally mature group leader. Among fans online, the members are often represented by a different animal emoji. \"They're superstars, but they have a human side as well,\" says YJ Chee, a 24-year-old Singaporean based in the US who describes himself as a member of ARMY, the name BTS uses to refer to its fans and an acronym for \"Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth.\" \"It makes them relatable.\"  \ud83d\ude34 pic.twitter.com/a6J7ld3anE\u2014 \ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8 (@BTS_twt) May 16, 2019\n\nOf course, it's easy to be cynical about the authenticity of the image they present online. BTS are closely managed and never mention their romantic lives. But the clips have created a kind of intimacy between BTS and their fans that other K-pop groups have since tried to imitate. \"They don't distance themselves that much from their fans,\" says David Kim, who runs YouTube channel DKDKTV where he analyzes K-pop. \"They just show themselves how they are -- they show the good and bad. I think that's what's different from other idols.\"  And with the Korean market lukewarm on BTS, that ARMY helped the band break America.  Becoming a household nameBTS looked abroad early. In 2014, while still relatively low profile on home turf, BTS began chipping away at the US market. They were a breakout success at that year's KCON, a K-pop convention in Los Angeles, where they performed in schoolboy outfits. Their music made nods to hip-hop and electronic dance music (EDM), genres that were popular in the West.

In November 2017, they made their US television debut, performing at the American Music Awards.They weren't the first K-pop group to try to break the overseas market.

But the personal connection with their fan base established through their social media presence gave them a huge advantage, says Cho.

Individual BTS members don't have social media accounts, meaning the group's fan following was concentrated on one account per platform.  In 2017, as their fame rose stateside, they landed appearances on \"The Ellen Show\" and Jimmy Kimmel. Cho believes it was the group's large social media following that got the US TV shows interested.   \"(BTS) really had to rely on their fans to be their advocates whereas other groups had a bigger machine behind them,\" Cho adds. \"I think it was ... the power of their numbers of Twitter followers ... which really brought them a lot of media attention, which helped them become a household name.\"An ecosystem of fansBTS aren't just savvy at social media -- to their fans, they are trailblazers within the K-pop genre.While K-pop hits are mostly not written by the band members, many BTS songs have one of the members credited as a writer or producer, particularly J-Hope and former underground rappers Suga and RM. But more importantly, their songwriting -- particularly in their earlier works -- goes beyond the love-lorn lyrics of some other pop hits. In 2014's \"Spine Breaker,\" BTS hit out at young people who are using their parents' money to buy expensive things. In 2015's \"Baepsae\" they rebuke the older generation for promoting the idea that the younger generation are lazy. In 2018's \"Idol\" they discuss the importance of loving yourself, regardless of what others think.BTS's works also often reference literature or philosophy. Their latest album, \"Map of the Soul: Persona,\" is a reference to the work of psychiatrist Carl Jung -- and even the album's party hit \"Dionysus,\" ostensibly an ode to getting drunk, references the Greek god of wine.As new fans tuned in to BTS, they found a group with elaborate music videos and experimental fashion that sometimes bordered on feminine, at least to Western eyes. Both on and off stage, BTS members wore chokers, blouse-like, silk shirts and visible makeup that made them look glossy and beautiful in a way that didn't necessarily fit with the the traditional Western conception of masculinity. \"The more time fans spend thinking about all of the different elements that go into the group that they're interested in, the stronger that attachment will be,\" Cho says. \"I think it's a really potent mix, you're not just a casual fan of BTS, you have to be initiated into their world and then you get sucked in.\"Another BTS?To some, BTS' success is a sign that the so-called hallyu wave -- the global popularity of South Korean entertainment -- isn't just coming, it's crashing upon US shores.In April, Korean foursome Blackpink became the first female K-pop group to play Coachella. Seven of the top 10 artists on Billboard's social charts for the first week of June came from South Korea.But the effects of BTS's breakout success might be broader. Some of David Kim's 500,000 subscribers have also told him they're learning Korean to better understand BTS's message.        \"I feel extremely proud, the Korean pride is exploding,\" David Kim says. \"It's absolutely unbelievable. If you think of this small country ...  and this small group that doesn't even speak English, spreading all this Korean culture and topping the charts and stuff, it's just unbelievable.\" Cho says BTS's aesthetic, which is a representation of East Asian masculinity, is helping to change what mainstream viewers think about the possibility of gender presentation and what Asian bodies represent. Suk-young Kim, Director for the Center for Performance Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) thinks BTS are doing a lot for Asian males, who haven't always been presented well in US media. \"BTS's ubiquitous visibility and positive image will do much to create cool 'Asianness,'\" she said.But she cautions against seeing BTS as a game changer for K-pop overall.Photos of BTS member Kin Seok-jin, better known as Jin, are displayed at a subway station on June 2, 2018 in Seoul, South Korea. Fans often pay for ad space to celebrate the anniversary or birthday of their idol. In this case, they are celebrating Jin's 5th anniversary of his debut with BTS.\"BTS and K-pop should not be bundled up together,\" said Suk-young Kim. \"BTS, in a way, has been breaking a lot of the conventional molds of K-pop.\"Some fans feel the same way, pointing to how BTS were never especially popular in South Korea, and instead had to rely on the online fandom to break into foreign markets.Kim believes the next BTS isn't coming anytime soon.\"Currently (BTS) are being compared to The Beatles and that is just crazy,\" he says. \"The Beatles in world history are one of the top, top groups. And a K-pop climbed up the ladder up to that level. I think it's going to be unrivaled for at least decades.\"  CNN's Jake Kwon contributed to this report",

        "content": "(CNN)Laura Molles is so attuned to birds that she can tell where birds of some species are from just by listening to their song. She's not a real-world Dr Doolittle. She's an ecologist in Christchurch, New Zealand, who specializes in a little-known area of science: bird dialects.While some birds are born knowing how to sing innately, many need to be taught how to sing by adults -- just like humans. Those birds can develop regional dialects, meaning their songs sound slightly different depending on where they live. Think Boston and Georgia accents, but for birds.Just as speaking the local language can make it easier for humans to fit in, speaking the local bird dialect can increase a bird's chances of finding a mate. And, more ominously, just as human dialects can sometimes disappear as the world globalizes, bird dialects can be shaped or lost as cities grow. The similarities between human language and bird song aren't lost on Molles -- or on her fellow bird dialect experts.Read More\"There are wonderful parallels,\" said American ornithologist Donald Kroodsma, the author of \"Birdsong for the Curious Naturalist: Your Guide to Listening.\" \"Culture, oral traditions -- it's all the same.\"The first bird dialect expertsFor centuries, bird song has inspired poets and musicians, but it wasn't until the 1950s that scientists really started paying attention to bird dialects.One of the pioneers of the field was a British-born behaviorist named Peter Marler, who became interested in the subject when he noticed that chaffinches in the United Kingdom sounded different from valley to valley.At first, he transcribed bird songs by hand, according to a profile of him in a Rockefeller University publication. Later, he used a sonagram, which Kroodsma describes on his website as \"a musical score for birdsong.\" (\"You really need to see these songs to believe them, our eyes are so much better than our ears,\" Kroodsma said.)\n\n\n\nThese native New Zealand birds have regional dialects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPelorus Bridge\n\nKennedys Bush\nGibraltar Rock\nOmahu Bush\n\nTe Urewera\nMapara\nLake Rotoehu\nPureora\n\n\n\n\nBellbird\nPelorus Bridge, Marlborough, 2003\nKennedys Bush, Port Hills, Banks Peninsula, 2008\nGibraltar Rock, Port Hills, Banks Peninsula, 2014\nOmahu Bush, Port Hills, Banks Peninsula, 2014\n\n\nKokako\nTe Urewera, Bay of Plenty, 2001 \nMapara, Waikato, 2003\nLake Rotoehu, Bay of Plenty, 2004\nPureora, Waikato, 2005\n\n\n\nSource: Laura Molles | Maps4news.com/\u00a9HERE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 60s and 70s, scientists put baby birds into sound isolation chambers to see if they would be able to sing their songs, according to ornithologist David Luther. Scientists found that some birds -- the ones that learn their songs -- couldn't sing at all. \"They just continued like a baby babble for their entire life,\" he said. Those birds are known as \"true song birds.\" In other birds, singing was innate. \"When they came of age they could just sing a perfect song no problem.\" When birds are copying adults, scientists discovered, they sometimes make a mistake. That mistake in turn is copied by other birds, and a local dialect develops. That means that dialects can only exist in true song birds because they have a \"learned oral tradition,\" says Kroodsma.An adult white-crowned sparrow on a log. Dialects can also be created as birds adapt to the local environment, said American ornithologist Elizabeth Derryberry. Birds that can be heard better may find a mate better, meaning their song is more likely to be handed down from generation to generation. It relates to an idea developed by Bernie Krause, the founder of soundscape ecology, that animals make sounds at different pitches so they can all be heard. Some dialects shift fast -- even within a breeding season. Other birds hold on to their dialects for decades. When Luther researched San Francisco dialects of white-crowned sparrows -- a common bird in North America -- he found that some dialects hadn't changed at all in 40 years.Dialects and dating (in birds)For something that is often the result of a copying glitch, dialects can be very useful.According to Molles, birds communicate for two reasons: Either they are trying to tell off their neighbor, or they are trying to attract females. \"Nothing very poetic, unfortunately,\" she quips.When it comes to defending territory from other birds of the same species who aren't local to the area, knowing the local dialect allows for more complex interaction. Mimicking a song note for note is seen as aggressive to birds, so having a wider repertoire means a bird can get its point across without escalating the interaction to a fight.      Knowing the local dialect is also useful when it comes to finding a romantic partner.In many species, it's the male who does the singing. According to Molles, females tend to prefer a familiar dialect -- it suggests the male birds know the local area, has territory, and isn't just \"someone who's passing through.\" Some birds are bilingual, or even trilingual -- perhaps because they have grown up around different local dialects. When they are mating, they'll opt to sing the local dialect of wherever they choose to settle, Luther said. But not having the right dialect isn't an insurmountable barrier. Kroodsma gave the example of a prairie warbler in Massachusetts, where he is based, which has returned every year for the past few years. Although the bird has a very atypical song, it attracted females and raised babies every year.\"Someone might say, 'Well there's the novelty effect, a male with a highly different song and all the females think that's sexy,'\" he said. \"But that's just a wild guess.\"It's something that researchers think about in places like New Zealand, where threatened birds are sometimes reintroduced into new areas. Researchers want to be sure that if they reintroduce birds, that they will reintegrate, even if they don't have the right dialect. A Kokako -- a New Zealand native  bird -- in Tiritiri Matangi Island Wildlife Sanctuary.In Molles' experience, it tends to work if a group of birds are reintroduced at once, so they have fellow birds with an odd dialect.She was involved in reintroducing Kokako -- a native grey-blue bird with a violin-like call -- into an area of New Zealand hundreds of kilometers away from where they were born. At first, the newcomers might breed among themselves, she said. But in the future, they might integrate. The offspring of the newcomers will likely start interbreeding with the offspring of the original population who grew up familiar with both the new and local dialect. \"The female is not necessarily looking for someone who matches the song that her dad was singing,\" Molles said. \"She's finding a mate who matches the area where she's looking to settle -- he's not just some odd-ball bird who may not belong there.\"How humans are changing bird dialectsAs cities around the world went into lockdown, a series of questions occurred to Derryberry.Over the years, birds had begun singing at a higher pitch in cities to be heard over the low hum of traffic and construction. What would happen to the birds when cities went silent? If it was quieter, would the new generation of birds sing at a lower pitch? And next year, when it was time to breed, would they be heard once the city noise returned?She's still working to answer those questions, but Kroodsma is skeptical that the brief period of quiet could have been long enough to have any impact on bird dialects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was pretty depressing hearing some of those and thinking, We're never going to hear that again.\"Laura Molles\n\n\nEven if our coronavirus shutdowns haven't changed bird dialects this time, it's worth thinking about how we are shaping -- and destroying -- bird dialects generally. Something as small as a powerline could be enough to split a population of birds and lead to the creation of a new dialects, Kroodsma says. In New Zealand, a land of birds where the only native land mammals are bats, there would have been a greater range of dialects before humans arrived and reduced birds' habitat, Molles says.Molles recalls finding historical recordings of a population of native Kokako that are now gone.\"Some of the songs on those tapes were just amazing -- strange metallic sounds that you would never have even guessed were made by a bird,\" she said.\"It was pretty depressing hearing some of those and thinking, We're never going to hear that again.\"Design and graphics by Jason Kwok and Natalie Leung.

        "content": "Christchurch, New Zealand (CNN)On a sunny autumn afternoon, two wizards in long, black robes and pointed hats sat down for coffee in one of New Zealand's biggest cities.It wasn't Halloween, and they weren't on their way to a costume party. And while they attracted attention from passersby, there was no finger pointing or all-out stares.That's because, in Christchurch, seeing a wizard isn't completely out of the ordinary.For decades, the city has had an official wizard. Born in the United Kingdom, Ian Brackenbury Channell settled in New Zealand in the 1970s, where he became known as The Wizard. As if to reinforce how serious he is, he even held a New Zealand driver's license issued to The Wizard, although he says he hasn't officially changed his name. The Wizard in central Christchurch, New Zealand, on June 2, 2020. Over the years, he became a fixture in the city. On the paved square in front of Christchurch's cathedral, he pontificated on his life theories, wore wizard robes and became such a well-known figure that he earned himself a TripAdvisor rating (four out of five stars). Since 1998, he's been paid 16,000 New Zealand dollars ($10,400) annually by the Christchurch City Council for \"wizardry.\"Read MoreNow age 87, The Wizard spends less time in the public eye. He wants to find a successor -- and appears to have got one in 39-year-old Ari Freeman, who teaches guitar and fronts a psychedelic funk band. As he and Freeman sit at at a table outside a sunny, inner-city cafe, a middle-aged cyclist calls out to them: \"No casting spells fellas!\"\"Can't promise anything,\" Freeman quips. Becoming a wizardAs a young man, The Wizard backpacked around Europe, was a Royal Air Force Officer in Canada, and taught English literature at the University of Tehran. But it wasn't until he moved to Australia with his then-wife that he found the role he would spend his life playing: The Wizard. After finishing his degree in sociology and psychology, he worked as a community arts organizer for the University of Western Australia in Perth, and then as a teaching fellow in sociology at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney. There, he started what he called a \"fun revolution,\" aimed at bringing love, logic and levity to the world, and turning the university into a \"theater of the absurd.\" When he lost his university job, he hatched a plan with the vice chancellor to give him a new position -- UNSW's first official wizard. \"I've invented a wizard out of nowhere,\" says The Wizard. \"There were no wizards when I arrived in the world, except in books.\" A picture of him in the role -- published by Origins, the newsletter of the UNSW Archives -- shows him wearing a leather jacket, standing on a chair and holding a skull like a modern-day Hamlet. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wizard was a prominent part of campus life at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney, Australia.

As he sees it, his role is to be a kind of provocateur -- someone who brings a sense of fun to the world, but also criticizes the system. A showman, who doesn't mind making a fool of himself. \"Every day the world gets more serious, so fun is the most powerful thing in the world right now,\" he says.But, as The Wizard tells it, there were plenty of people against him. The academics in Sydney didn't like what he was doing (\"academics don't like silly, fun things,\" he says) so he headed to the University of Melbourne, where he claims he led his own cosmology department. The university, however, says that is an \"aggrandizement\" of what he was doing -- according to them, he was not employed by the university, although he was associated with the student union. When he became a wizard, he said he lost all his friends and his wife left him -- he says he turned her throwing him out of the house into a ritual by inviting friends to come, too. \"To me it was fun, but not to her. She's still furious.\"So in 1974, he moved to Christchurch, New Zealand. And it was there that his wizarding path really took off. Mystical ChristchurchIf there was ever a place to be a wizard, Christchurch is it. While many inner-city buildings are still in disrepair from the 2011 earthquake that devastated the city and killed 185 people, some of its Gothic-revival architecture remains, and there's a distinctly British feel to the built environment. When low-lying fog rolls through the city, clinging to the gray stone buildings and colonial-era statues, it has the effect of conjuring a scene out of a British crime series, or low-budget horror movie. In short: it's suitably mystical for a wizard. The Wizard after the Christchurch Square reopened to the public in 2013 following a deadly earthquake in 2011. When The Wizard arrived in Christchurch in the 1970s, he saw the city as the \"romantic dream,\" a beautiful place far from the rest of the world which was unlikely to become a hub for economic development. Once there, he became a mainstay in Cathedral Square, where he stood on a ladder and dressed in a variety of outfits, including in a loin cloth as John the Baptist. He praised the British Empire and criticized what he calls \"anti-male sexism.\"At first, the council wasn't taken with him, according to The Wizard. They initially refused to appoint him the city's official wizard and wouldn't grant him the written permission he needed to speak in the square under Christchurch bylaws. So The Wizard played \"silly games with the council\" -- he wore a gas mask and spoke in French, hoping to evade the rules.The Wizard waits for the arrival of Britain's Prince William and Kate during their royal visit to Christchurch on April 14, 2014. \"I've been the most popular man in Christchurch since then,\" The Wizard claimed. \"And the most hated man by the bureaucrats.\"But as his profile rose, he got more official recognition.In 1982, the New Zealand Art Gallery Directors Association said he had become a living work of art --  the Auckland City Art Gallery document described the work's medium as \"artist's corporeal substance\" and its value as \"priceless.\" (Funnily enough, The Wizard is not overly positive about modern art, which he describes as \"mainly about writing applications for grants.\")In 1988, Waimate -- a town not far from Christchurch -- was in the grips of a drought. The organizers of a local agriculture fair invited him to perform a rain dance, and, according to The Wizard, rain fell only a few hours after he began beating his drum. \"The Wizard adjourned to the refreshment tent to watch the downpour and partake of the free whiskeys that were thrust into his hands by the visibly shaken farmers,\" his website says. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA letter sent from then-New Zealand Prime Minister Mike Moore to The Wizard in 1990.

(Credit: Supplied by The Wizard)\n\n\n\nIn 1990, then New Zealand Prime Minister Mike Moore wrote him a letter on the official prime ministerial letterhead, suggesting that he should \"urgently consider my suggestion that you become the Wizard of New Zealand, Antarctica and relevant offshore areas.\"\"No doubt there will be implications in the area of spells, blessings, curses, and other supernatural matters that are beyond the competence of mere Prime Ministers,\" Moore wrote. Eight years later came perhaps the biggest validation of his status to date -- and an amazing about-turn. Christchurch City Council contracted him to \"provide acts of wizardry and other wizard-like-services as part of promotional work for the city of Christchurch,\" according to a council spokesperson. The Wizard is paid 16,000 New Zealand dollars ($10,400) annually -- for reference, New Zealand's pension for a single person is 22,039 New Zealand dollars annually after tax. The wizard doesn't pay tax, and is financially supported by his fiance of 43 years, Alice Flett, who he met at an Anglican church in Christchurch, and got engaged to in a public performance. The Wizard of Christchurch and his partner Alice Flett attend the world premiere of The Changeover on September 25, 2017 in Christchurch, New Zealand.  According to a Council spokesperson, his services include assisting with promoting local events and tourism, as well as welcoming dignitaries or delegations to the city, which would usually involve no more than 200 hours of work each year.In 2009, The Wizard received the Queen's Service Medal -- one of the highest honors in New Zealand. \"I couldn't believe it, I thought it would never happen,\" The Wizard says. A wizarding apprenticeFreeman has been The Wizard's apprentice for six years -- but has seen himself as a wizard for far longer.\"I think it came together in my mid-20s. It's one of those things you don't have a name for and when you look back, you realize you've been doing it for a long, long time.\"In 2014, Freeman decided to take the next step. He walked up to The Wizard, already sporting a long beard. \"Hi, I'm Ari, and I'm a young wizard,\" he recalls saying. \"OK, let's get started then,\" Freeman says the Wizard replied. The Wizard and his apprentice, Ari Freeman, in Christchurch on June 2, 2020. Being a wizard's apprentice -- as you might imagine -- isn't an especially formal arrangement. The pair meet up and argue a lot, although Freeman is rarely able to change The Wizard's opinion. After all, the Wizard -- who often slips into impassioned tangents -- isn't shy about holding strong views. The Census, which he has evaded for decades, is \"a branding of animals on the farm.\" Wicca, also known as Pagan witchcraft, is \"shallow consumerist stuff, I'm afraid ... It's like vegetarianism, it's a fad.\" The Wizard is resistant to the idea of a female wizard, and suggests women can be fairies, instead. He's not convinced by climate change, although he does like the idea of a simpler way of life (\"The Hobbits were right.\")  Among the things Freeman and the elder wizard disagree on is music. While The Wizard says a lot of music is \"evil,\" Freeman thinks music is a form of magic. If he plays the right song in the right context, he can make people dance. \"They'll think it's their idea to dance, but my song did it,\" he said.Freeman went into being a wizard with few expectations, but in his tens of thousands of interactions, he's barely had any negative experiences. He's had a similarly positive reception from his friends, family and partner. When he told his partner that he wanted to be a wizard, \"she loved it.\" The Wizard and his apprentice, Ari Freeman, don't always agree. But times are changing for wizarding types. The Wizard's old haunt -- Cathedral Square -- is not what it once was. A barricade encircles the old church, and birds perch in the earthquake-ruined vault. And there is perhaps little need for a public figure whose views are increasingly out of step with those around him.Freeman knows he can't be a wizard without the community's buy in. If people want a wizard, he will be one, he says. The council did not comment when asked whether Freeman would be given The Wizard's contract.\"I want the wizard phenomenon to continue, and I will totally fulfill that role,\" Freeman said. \"Like a band needs a guitar player -- I'll be that guitar player.\" To Freeman, being a wizard is a way to empower people who are lost or depressed, and shake them out of the bounds of what's expected.\"It takes someone to do something unusual to poke their head in to create a zeigeist change,\" Freeman said. \"And those people are magicians.\"",

For the next four weeks -- at least -- the couple won't be able to see each other in person.That's because the country is in lockdown in a bid to stop the spread of Covid-19.\"At first, we didn't really understand the rules -- we kind of thought, it will be fine, we'll be able to see each other once or twice a week,\" says 25-year-old Ansell, who has been with her boyfriend for five years. \"And then it kind of dawned on us that that's probably not good.\"Bryan invited her to stick out the lockdown in his flat, but another flatmate's girlfriend was already staying. Besides, she wanted to be at her own place -- and it was a bit small for him to stay with her. Henny Ansell and her boyfriend Michael Bryan are doing long distance for the next month, although they're both in the same city.Read MoreSo instead, the couple -- who met while working at a local pizza chain -- will spend the next few weeks chatting virtually, even though they live around 8 kilometers (5 miles) apart. They already text each other good morning and good night, but instead of in-person hang outs, their immediate future looks set to feature constant texting and watching Netflix shows together but apart. \"It's very tempting (to meet up), and it's frustrating because it's like, oh surely we could just meet up and hug,\" Ansell says. \"But you can't -- that destroys the whole purpose of it.\"It's very tempting (to meet up), and it's frustrating because it's like, oh surely we could just meet up and hug. But you can't -- that destroys the whole purpose of it.Henny AnsellAs countries impose strict lockdown measures and travel restrictions to combat the coronavirus pandemic, couples all over the world are facing similar predicaments. While some -- like Ansell -- are choosing to stay apart, others have found coronavirus has brought them closer together.The question of how couples should handle lockdowns is so widespread that it was even brought up at a press conference last week with Jenny Harries, the United Kingdom's deputy chief medical officer.\"I'm clearly going to start a new career here in relationship counseling, so I shall tread very carefully as I work through this answer,\" quipped Harries. \"Test really carefully your strength of feeling, stay within the household either together or apart. But keep it that way.\" Together, apartOn the other side of the world in the United Kingdom, 21-year-old James Marsh and his girlfriend Kiera Leaper were due to celebrate their one-year anniversary on Monday.Instead, the country went into lockdown.James Marsh and Kiera Leaper are spending the next three weeks apart due to the lockdown.The pair -- who study together at the University of Leeds -- had seen it coming. When it looked like the country could go into lockdown, the pair squeezed in one last hangout before Marsh retreated to his family home at the opposite end of the country from Leaper. The lockdown is set to continue for at least three weeks. \"We normally see each other every day, we stay with each other pretty much every night,\" Marsh said. \"To go from that to this is obviously quite a big change.\"This will be the longest time we've gone without seeing each other since we've been officially together.\"  This will be the longest time we've gone without seeing each other since we've been officially together.James MarshSo far, the couple have FaceTimed every day, and spend time together with their friends on online video chat platform Houseparty. They're trying to keep busy -- Marsh with his course work, and Leaper with exercise. But there are challenges. Marsh and many of his friends are in the final months of their three-year undergraduate degrees, and they're sad they won't get to celebrate together. \"We'll just sort of go away with coronavirus being the memory of our third year,\" he said.And while technology was helpful for keeping Marsh and his girlfriend connected, it wasn't the same as being in the same room, he said.Even so, he thinks this time apart will strengthen their relationship.\"I think it's really important to be able to tackle stuff like this ... you can't always just rely on that person being there if you want to stick it out for the long haul,\" Marsh said.\"You might get a job that requires you to go away for work or stuff like that, and you can't have a dependency on that person in that case.\"Secret loveHemangay, a University of Delhi student, hasn't heard his boyfriend's voice for about a week.The 19-year-old, who asked not to use his real name as he is not out to his parents, lives with his family in New Delhi, the capital of India. For the past few months, he's been dating his 22-year-old boyfriend -- in secret.Searching for love in the time of coronavirusOn Tuesday, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the country of 1.3 billion was going into lockdown for the next 21 days. That means no one is allowed outside. Public transport is shut, so Hemangay wouldn't be able to make it to his boyfriend's house on the other side of Delhi, anyway. And because Hemangay can't take walks, he hasn't been able to phone his boyfriend -- he's too worried that his parents would find out about their relationship if he calls him from the family home.\"I'm still a student, I'm not that independent that I can go out and survive my life on my own terms,\" he said. \"Once I become independent, then maybe I can take that risk.\" Since I'm not out with my family, I just can't openly contact him or chat with him. It's really tough for us to communicate.Hemangay\"Since I'm not out with my family, I just can't openly contact him or chat with him,\" he said. \"It's really tough for us to communicate.\"So for the next few weeks at least, one of the only ways they can communicate is messaging over WhatsApp. It's a far cry from their normal lives, when they would meet up almost every day after university. Hemangay last saw his boyfriend two weeks ago, before the measures -- and they had no idea what was to come. \"That is the worst part about this, that I didn't know this would be the last time,\" he said. Hemangay is dreading the next few weeks of separation, but he knows there's nothing he can do. \"I have never felt so helpless in my entire life,\" he said.Love in a time of uncertaintyApril was meant to be the light at the end of the tunnel for Isobel Ewing, 30, who has been in a long distance relationship with her boyfriend. Ewing, a broadcast journalist, moved to Budapest, Hungary in mid-January. She had been looking forward to April, when she would see her boyfriend of almost two years, Sam Smoothy, for the first time in months. A professional skier, Smoothy had been in North America for a few months, and had planned to come and spend time with her in Hungary.  But coronavirus has thwarted those plans. Isobel Ewing and Sam Smoothy were meant to see each other in April. Coronavirus got in the way.After United States President Donald Trump announced on March 11 that he was banning travel from continental Europe to the US, they became afraid Smoothy would get stuck in North America. A few days later, Hungary closed its borders to foreigners, meaning Smoothy could no longer visit. That meant Smoothy was forced to go back to New Zealand instead of Hungary -- and their plans were on hold. Now, Smoothy is in New Zealand, self-isolating at Ewing's family holiday home. Ewing needs to stay in Budapest for work. She works from her Budapest apartment, and goes for runs in the hills and alongside the Danube River. They don't know when they'll be able to see each other again.   \"With long distance you get used to being apart,\" Ewing said. \"But it's so key to have that time together to look forward to. And then to just have that plucked out from under us ... I'm kind of still processing it.\" Moving fasterFor three years, Anika, 32, has wanted to marry her partner, but things outside their control kept getting in the way.Finally, the New Delhi-based couple set their dates. They would register their marriage in court on March 20, hold a big dance party on April 10 with 400 people, and then have the wedding ceremony on April 12. Then the coronavirus outbreak happened.As the Indian government began taking more measures -- including suspending all tourist visas -- the couple grew more worried about their wedding. Anika, who asked not to use her real name for privacy reasons, started thinking of a plan B.We didn't want to postpone it again. What if something else went wrong? What if nothing changes? We wanted to start our lives together -- we didn't want to wait.AnikaAs the situation evolved, their wedding plans kept changing. Finally, with only days to spare, they decided they would get married on March 20, and hold a small ceremony after the court proceedings. \"That entire week was pretty traumatic,\" she said, adding that they ended up uninviting guests to keep numbers down to 30 or so people for social distancing purposes. \"We were sending last minute messages just apologizing to people.\"In the end, it was a sweet, intimate wedding, Anika says. There were nods to the crisis unfolding outside -- the couple updated their wedding hashtag to #loveinthetimeofcorona, and kept sanitizing and fumigating the space.\"Sometimes it's destiny,\" she said. \"At that time yes, you feel stressed and disappointed. But now in retrospect, I think it was perfect.\"Even though it wasn't the wedding they had dreamed of, Anika and her husband didn't want to postpone it. In India, it's not culturally acceptable for couples to live together before marrying. Now, the pair have gone straight into life together -- under lockdown. \"We had been seeing each other for a really long time, we'd been planning this wedding for a really long time,\" she said.\"We didn't want to postpone it again. What if something else went wrong? What if nothing changes? We wanted to start our lives together -- we didn't want to wait.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)As two older, White, male candidates fought for supremacy in the United States election, New Zealand was offering its electorate a more progressive choice: two White women.But in New Zealand, that was just the start. When Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was reelected in a landslide last month, she brought with her a diverse cast of politicians that make up what is -- by some measures -- the most inclusive parliament in the world. Almost half of New Zealand's newly sworn-in Parliament are women and 11% are LGBTQ. Both New Zealand's Indigenous M\u0101ori and people with Pacific Island heritage are represented at a slightly higher rate than in the general population.\n\n\nPoliticians from diverse backgrounds aren't just making up numbers in Parliament -- they're in key positions of power. Read MoreEight of Ardern's 20-strong cabinet -- the highest-ranked lawmakers -- are also women, and a quarter are M\u0101ori. Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson will be the first openly gay politician to hold that role in New Zealand. And foreign minister Nanaia Mahuta, who wears a moko kauae or traditional M\u0101ori face tattoo, is the first Indigenous woman in New Zealand's history to represent the country in that position. \"It looks like New Zealand looks,\" said Jennifer Curtin, a professor of politics and director of the Public Policy Institute at the University of Auckland, of the country's government. \"We're not male, pale and stale anymore.\"Here's what New Zealand's new Parliament looks likeNew Zealand already had a relatively diverse Parliament. Following the 2017 election, 38% of New Zealand's MPs were women -- a record in the country. Now it's 48%. The proportion of LGBTQ lawmakers has also increased from 7% to 11%.M\u0101ori representation has slipped, however, from 23% at the last election to 21%. That's the lowest level of M\u0101ori representation since 2014, but it is still higher than the total proportion of people who identify as M\u0101ori in the general population -- around 17%. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiversity in the New Zealand Parliament\n\nSelect a group\n\nWomen\nLGBTQ\nIndigenous\n\n\n\nAlmost half are women, a record in New Zealand. Last election, 38% of MPs were women.\nMore than one out of 10 parliamentarians are \n\t\tLGBTQ, the highest proportion in New Zealand's history.\nOne fifth are M\u0101ori, New Zealand's Indigenous people. That's higher than the general population, but the lowest proportion in Parliament since 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Zealand's Parliament has had M\u0101ori seats since 1867, soon after the country was founded, but these have sometimes been seen as tokenism. Until 1967, M\u0101ori candidates were only allowed to contest a limited number of M\u0101ori seats, and it was only in 1975 that M\u0101ori were able to choose whether they wanted to be on the M\u0101ori electoral roll. Kelvin Davis, who is M\u0101ori and the deputy leader of Ardern's center-left Labour Party, said he was happy with the level of Indigenous representation in New Zealand's Cabinet. \"I think (the level of representation in Cabinet) is a first ever and we're proud to be a part of that,\" he said, according to public broadcaster Radio New Zealand (RNZ). Labour MP Louisa Wall, who is M\u0101ori and lesbian, says that the increase in LGBTQ representation will create an even more progressive society. New Zealand introduced same-sex civil unions in 2004, and in 2013, Wall spearheaded a bill to make same-sex marriage legal.  \"We have come a long way and for me it is about representative democracy. We reflect our larger New Zealand population,\" Wall said, according to RNZ.Curtin said that having a representative legislature meant there was a range of perspectives at the decision table. \"Diversity in itself is good,\" she said. \"Anything that disrupts the homogeneity and the dominance of the White majority, or the colonizers, of this place.\"Here's how that stacks up globallyOut of thousands of active lawmakers across the globe, just 194 are openly gay in 42 countries, according to data collated by Andrew Reynolds, from the School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University.Of those countries, New Zealand now has the highest proportion of LGBTQ lawmakers, at 11%, according to his data. (Previously it was the United Kingdom, at 8%.)In New Zealand, 3.5% of adults identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual or another sexual identity other than straight, according to a 2018 Statistics New Zealand survey of approximately 12,000 households. The surveyors, however, said the result \"may underestimate\" the true proportion as the data was collected via face-to-face interviews. When it comes to gender New Zealand doesn't have the highest proportion of women lawmakers in the world -- that title goes to Rwanda, where 61% of seats in the country's lower house are occupied by women. The country lost so many men during the 1994 genocide that women stepped in to fill key leadership roles.      But New Zealand's 48% female legislature is the highest of all OECD countries, alongside Mexico (where a 2014 law dictates gender parity in politics), and well above the global average of 25%.New Zealand's closest neighbor, Australia, only has 31% female representation in its lower house, while Pacific Island countries have an average of 6%. When it comes to the overall population, there are slightly more women than men in New Zealand -- globally there are slightly more men than women, according to the CIA World Factbook.  As for ethnic diversity, the country is still lacking when it comes to representation of Asian New Zealanders, for example, who make up 15% of the country's general population, but only hold 7% of seats in Parliament. But demographer Paul Spoonley, a professor at Massey University in Auckland, said a parliament didn't need to perfectly match the overall makeup of the general population to be representative -- although warned if it was too different the public might lose trust in their lawmakers.\"I think it's really important that a political system represents the diversity including the ethnic diversity of a population, and that's because they bring that voice and experience,\" he said.      But there's still room for improvement The significance of all this is that New Zealand's Parliament looks more like the general population -- which in turn makes it more representative. But that doesn't mean it's perfect. While one in four New Zealanders have a disability -- defined by Statistics New Zealand as a long-term limitation in a person's ability to carry out daily activities -- Curtin said she was not aware of any MPs with disabilities. That's something disability advocate Jonny Wilkinson has also criticized, saying that the country's \"largest minority group\" still isn't represented. And Spoonley, the demographer, pointed out that diversity includes making sure a range of ages and socioeconomic backgrounds are represented. \"It's not a finished project,\" Curtin said. Not everyone in New Zealand is happy about Ardern's diverse Parliament. Right-wing blogger Olivia Pierson said Mahuta's moko kauae wasn't fitting for a foreign diplomat and that her appointment showed Ardern had \"gone full wokelette on stilts.\" Nanaia Mahuta introduces Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea James Marape to guests at Parliament on February 24, 2020 in Wellington, New Zealand.While New Zealand may have a diverse Parliament now, there's no guarantee for the future. The country's right-leaning parties have less diverse representation than its left-leaning parties, so a switch in government in 2023 could mean a less inclusive Parliament. New Zealand's main opposition party, National, has only two M\u0101ori MPs and only 30% of its lawmakers are women. No current National MPs are known to be LGBTQ.National leader Judith Collins -- who famously asked \"is there something wrong with being White?\" -- has dismissed concerns about diversity, arguing that her party has a \"diversity of thought.\" Curtin says she hopes that there's a \"contagion effect\" where parties on the right decide to become more diverse so they can attract voters. \"We have seen ebbs and flows on the representation of women before,\" she said. \"It's not a given that this degree of diversity will hold beyond the next three years.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)With beaches fringed with palm trees and pristine waters full of tropical fish, many Pacific Islands are the kinds of remote places you would expect to see on Instagram.But for China and Australia, these tiny islands have become the center of an emerging power struggle.Foreign involvement is nothing new for these islands, which collectively control an area of ocean bigger than Russia. Colonial governments ruled some of the 14 Pacific Island nations over different periods of time. They all now govern themselves but, due to poor economic growth, this is one of the world's most aid-dependent regions.  For decades, Australia has been the biggest donor of that aid. In many ways, that makes sense -- Australia is the richest nation in Oceania and nearly 206,700 people claimed Pacific Island ancestry in its 2016 census. As the country's Prime Minister Scott Morrison puts it: \"This is our patch.\"But in recent years, China has emerged as a major player in the region, too.     Read MoreThe Pacific Islands are home to fewer than 10 million people -- slightly less than the population of Sweden -- are thousands of miles from Beijing and have a combined GDP of about $33.77 billion, less than 1% of China's total GDP.  But that hasn't stopped the money flooding in, building bridges, roads and an airport.In Australia, some analysts fear their country's influence is under threat. \"Australia is certainly very worried about the level of investment (from China),\" said Michael O'Keefe, an expert on Pacific foreign relations at Melbourne's La Trobe University.  Prime Minister Morrison has made the Pacific Islands more of a priority than his predecessors since he came to power last year. As he announced a 2 billion Australian dollar ($1.5 billion) infrastructure fund for the region in November, he said: \"Australia cannot take its influence in the Southwest Pacific for granted. \"And sadly, I think too often we have.\"So why is China investing so much in this part of the world? First thing's first: What's China doing in the South Pacific?In many ways, China is doing things differently.In the past, Australia has taken what some see as a paternalistic approach in the Pacific Islands, investing in health, education and governance -- the things it thinks the nations need.  But the approach hasn't necessarily had the desired impact. Although Australia -- and other countries -- have been investing aid in the region for years, economic growth is slow. That's partly due to the geographic isolation of the islands and their small populations, but has been worsened by their vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters.  In most Pacific Island countries, more than 20% of the population is unable to afford all their basic needs, according to the World Bank. That has prompted questions about the effectiveness of aid.In papers in 2003 and 2010, Australian economist Helen Hughes said that \"aid has failed in the Pacific,\" because it undercut the private sector, impacting employment and economic growth. But Australian economist Matthew Dornan and Jonathan Pryke, director of the Pacific Islands Program at the Lowy Institute, argued in 2017 that aid has raised \"living standards beyond what they would be without aid.\" The Lowy Institute is a non-profit Australian think tank set up in 2003, which receives half of its funding from donations.      China, by contrast, is asking Pacific Island countries where they most need investment. That has tended to result in Beijing funding large-scale infrastructure projects.Data from the Lowy Institute on the eight countries where both Australia and China are investing shows that in all but one of the nations, China's biggest spend was on an infrastructure project, while all but one of Australia's top projects were non-infrastructure. In Papua New Guinea, for instance, China completed a $85 million road upgrade in 2017. Meanwhile, Australia has so far spent $219 million on an initiative to deliver essential drugs such as vaccines, and increase health education, especially around the spread of HIV. In 2018, Australia's Minister for International Development and the South Pacific, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, blasted China for funding \"useless buildings\" that islands couldn't pay back, but didn't refer to any projects specifically. China lodged a formal diplomatic protest against the minister, calling her remarks \"full of prejudice and bias.\"      There's another difference between the two players: how the money is delivered.While Australia gives its aid through grants with no obligation for repayment, most of China's spending is in the form of loans, according to the Lowy Institute. Many of the Chinese loans were taken between 2006 and 2010, said the Lowy Institute's Jonathan Pryke. This was during a \"gold rush\" period when China was increasingly lending to countries around the world, including in Africa. The loans usually have a grace period of five to 10 years, according to Pryke. So far, there's no record of any Pacific Island countries paying China back, Lowy Institute research found.  Earlier this year, the US Ambassador to Australia, Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr., described China's spending in the Pacific as \"payday loan\" diplomacy -- intentionally getting countries to take on unsustainable debts in order to buy political leverage. US Vice President Mike Pence has echoed his sentiment.  But the data doesn't back up these claims.    Of the 14 Pacific Island nations, six are rated as being at a high risk of debt distress by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), meaning they are likely to default on their loans, and three are at a moderate risk.      But last year, Australian researchers Rohan Fox and Matthew Dornan found that while China is the biggest bilateral lender in the region, Tonga was the only country where Chinese lending dominated. In several other countries, multilateral lending was the main source of debt.    Furthermore, a recent paper by independent, US-based research provider Rhodium Group found that when China renegotiated its debt with over-leveraged countries, it was usually to the advantage of the borrower. But the authors cautioned that might not be true in the future: \"Beijing could still use loan renegotiations to advance foreign and domestic policy objectives.\"Many countries have welcomed China's investment. Vanuatu, which received an $80 million loan to build a wharf, thanked the Chinese government for funding projects that no other donor would help with. On Monday, PNG's Prime Minister James Marape said his country was open to investors from all countries.\"Whether they are from (China), or Australia, or right across the world, is inconsequential and irrelevant to us,\" he told reporters.So why is China investing in the Pacific Islands?That's the billion-dollar question: Why does China want to pour money into isolated countries, with small economies that might not be able to pay back their debts?  If you ask China, it says its spending is benign.People in Papua New Guinea gather at the roadside to welcome China's President Xi Jinping in Port Moresby on November 16, 2018, ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit. A banner thanks Xi for building their local school. \"China, based on equal, mutually beneficial, open and sustainable principles, keeps providing genuine assistance to Pacific Island countries without any political attachment,\" a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson told CNN in a faxed comment, adding that China had improved the livelihood of Pacific Island people and \"won wide acclaim.\"\"Is China's assistance good or bad? Is it a 'debt trap' or a 'pie in the sky'? The island countries and the people have the final say,\" the spokesperson said. There are also sound economic reasons for China to be in the South Pacific, including sourcing raw materials.Many of the South Pacific islands are rich with resources such as timber, minerals and fish. Since 2011, Beijing has invested more in Papua New Guinea (PNG) -- which is home to gold, nickel mines, liquified natural gas and timber forests -- than any other Pacific Island.Locals are seen selling fruit in Tubusereia Village on November 4, 2017 in Central Province, Papua New Guinea.  It might also want to help support ethnically Chinese people who live in those countries, said James Batley, an Asia-Pacific expert at Australian National University.Statistics on the number of Chinese living in the South Pacific are scarce, but in 2006, the South Pacific islands were already home to an estimated 80,000 Chinese.   Some were descended from Chinese traders who settled in the region in the 1800s, while others migrated more recently to work on Chinese construction projects. In the 2000s, anti-Chinese sentiment resulted in riots in the Solomon Islands, PNG and Tonga, where a fatal unrest prompted Beijing to send a charter plane to expatriate around 200 Chinese nationals. The issues behind the riots have differed. In PNG, which suffers from high unemployment, for instance, the hostility was towards Chinese business owners.Beijing has tried to improve local relations, changing tactics from bringing over its own construction workers to hiring more local staff, said University of the South Pacific's Gounder.Then, of course, there are the diplomatic reasons China might want to be in the Pacific. OK, so what are the diplomatic reasons?First, there's the issue of Taiwan, which Beijing claims sovereignty over.   Only 16 nations and the Holy See officially recognize Taiwan as an independent state, and six of them are in the South Pacific. For years, China has been attempting to win over Taiwan's few remaining allies and encourage them to accept its \"One China\" principle.      Of the six, three have strong ties to the US, which has what it describes as a \"robust unofficial relationship\" to Taiwan, an island of 23.5 million people. Taiwan also invests in the South Pacific -- it has spent $215.87 million between 2011 and 2017, compared with China's $1.21 billion, according to Lowy Institute data. Papua New Guinea, where both Taiwan and China invest, downgraded its diplomatic relations with Taiwan last year, which Taipei said was due to pressure from Beijing. The Solomon Islands, which recognizes Taiwan, is expected to decide whether it will cut ties with Taiwan in the next few months. The country's former Prime Minister Gordon Darcy Lilo said changing course could boost investment to the country. Taiwan has invested there, China is its top trading partner, according to a 2018 report from the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission. There are other reasons why China would want a Pacific Island nation on its side. Even though the entire population of the 14 Pacific Island nations is around the same size as a Chinese city, China still has the same voting power as a Pacific Island at the United Nations General Assembly. Pacific Island nations can be powerful friends despite their small size. What else is at stake?The islands could serve as destinations for future military bases.In April 2018, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that officials from China and Vanuatu were in talks about setting up a permanent military presence on the island. Both Beijing and Vanuatu denied the reports. A Chinese military base would be seen as a problem in the United States, which has had a presence in the South Pacific since World War II. The US still has military outposts on islands in this region, such as on Guam and the Marshall Islands.\n\n\n\n\nThe islands running from Japan to Taiwan and the Philippines, and from Japan to Guam and Palau form lines known as the first and second island chain. Academics and military theorists see them as a way for the US to contain China from gaining a strategic position in the region.  A 2018 US-China Economic and Security Review Commission report found that a Chinese military base or facility in the South Pacific could prevent US military access to the region -- and affect key partners, New Zealand and Australia.  \"Such a development could expand China's monitoring and surveillance capabilities in the region, helping Beijing mitigate US military presence in the region,\" the report authors wrote. Chinese bases in the South Pacific would also raise security concerns for Australia. Three of Australia's five main maritime trade routes pass through the Pacific. Even if China didn't threaten these routes, its presence could expose them to the possibility of future issues, which in turn could have serious implications for Australia's economy. I totally don't rule out a military base in any Pacific Island countryNeelesh Gounder, Fiji University of the South PacificAs Pryke puts it, a Chinese base in the South Pacific would likely \"profoundly change\" the way Australia looked at national defense and national security. In a Lowy Institute poll this year, 55% of those surveyed said if China opened a military base in a Pacific Island country, that would be a critical threat to the nation's vital interests.  Australia and the US have military plans of their own. Last year, the US, Australia and Papua New Guinea announced they would partner to redevelop a naval base on PNG's Manus Island, best known for a controversial and now shuttered migrant detention center. During World War II, the island was home to a Japanese base that was captured and taken over by the Allies. Pacific Islands Private Sector Organization board chair Stephen Lyon, who lives in the Cook Islands, believes most Pacific Islands don't want to be further militarized. But Fiji-based poverty and growth researcher Gounder said if there was a mutually beneficial deal, he didn't think South Pacific islands would say no to a Chinese base -- or an Australian one, for that matter. \"I totally don't rule out a military base in any Pacific Island country,\" he said.What is Australia worried about?To China, its investment in the Pacific Islands is small compared with the scale of its flagship multibillion Belt and Road Initiative.Beijing invested over $1.2 billion in the 14 South Pacific nations between 2011 and 2017, but last year alone, it pledged $60 billion in aid, investment and loans to Africa.In contrast, in the same period, Australia spent $6.3 billion in aid in the South Pacific, making the region one of the main beneficiaries of Australian aid. Australia has good reason to make that investment. Since the 1950s, it has been part of an agreement with the US and New Zealand, making it responsible for the security of the Pacific Islands. If a Pacific Island country was to encounter a crisis, there is an expectation that Australia -- as a good neighbor -- would assist.      And that means Australia has a lot more to lose. Any conflict or crisis could increase refugee flows to Australia or a need for troops to be deployed. After a period of ethnic violence in the Solomon Islands, Australia spent an estimated 2.8 billion Australian dollars ($1.96 billion) on a 14-year mission to stabilize the nation.  \"We are essentially the superpower in the Pacific and it's very important that we play our role,\" then-Australian Justice Minister Michael Keenan said in 2017, when the mission ended. Pacific Islands Private Sector Organization's Lyon said that while it was true that neither country was entirely altruistic, Australia had long term partnerships in the region. \"China has a very specific geostrategic focus in the region,\" he said.When asked whether Australia needed to be concerned about China's increased role, and why Australia was stepping up efforts in the region, an Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesperson said it was in the country's national interests to promote stability, security and prosperity in the Pacific.Chinese Fijians display banners on the arrival of the Peace Ark, the hospital ship of China's People's Liberation Army Navy, at Suva Port in Suva, Fiji, on August 22, 2014. \"The Pacific has significant investment needs, and Australia welcomes all investment that supports sustainable development in line with the priorities and ambitions of Pacific countries, is delivered transparently, and does not impose heavy debt burdens,\" the spokesperson said.  What does the Pacific think about all this?While Taiwan-aligned Nauru has publicly pushed back on China's involvement, many Pacific Island countries have embraced the additional investment. \"We are indeed very grateful,\" Fijian politician Ratu Epeli Nailatikau said earlier this year.     Australia's aid spend in the Pacific Islands dropped off in 2013, according to Lowy Institute data. But China's involvement has been a catalyst for traditional Pacific Island partners, such as Australia and New Zealand, to increase their involvement in the region. Morrison's $1.5 billion \"step up\" infrastructure investment program for the Pacific Islands was a \"direct response\" to push out Chinese influence and maintain Australia's position as the primary partner in the region, said La Trobe University's O'Keefe. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, middle row, poses for a photo with other leaders during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Port Moresby on November 17, 2018. Cook Islands-based Lyon said that, ultimately, the Pacific Islands are autonomous states that direct their own foreign policy -- the idea that outside powers might be able to influence them, as they had during their colonial pasts, was \"old-fashioned.\"\"The Pacific Islands are open to money wherever it comes from,\" he said. \"At the moment, I think the Pacific feels like it's getting something that benefits us.\"",

        "content": "New Delhi, India (CNN)In January this year, Kerala became the first Indian state to report a coronavirus case. Now, four months later, it claims it has flattened the curve. Although India has been under a strict nationwide lockdown since late March, cases have continued to rise -- the country of 1.3 billion now has more than 74,000 confirmed cases, including more than 2,400 deaths.But Kerala, a thin strip on the country's southern coast, has appeared to buck that trend.Although its has a population of around 36 million -- almost as big as Canada -- it has reported just 519 cases and four deaths. As of Saturday, it had only 16 active cases, according to the state's finance minister, Thomas Isaac.Medical staff collect samples from people at a kiosk to test for Covid-19 in Kerala, India, on April 6, 2020. For comparison, Maharashtra, the worst-affected state in India, has reported more than 23,000 cases, including more than 860 deaths. Read MoreEven accounting for their different population sizes, the states have very different outbreaks. Maharashtra has around 19 cases per 100,000, while Kerala has about 1. By way of comparison the United States, which has the world's highest reported death toll, has around 415 cases per 100,000 people.Experts say part of Kerala's success is thanks to swift action and learning from past outbreaks. But Kerala also shows how disparate India is -- and how much a person's chances against the virus depend on where in the country they live.What Kerala did rightAt the center of Kerala's response was woman who has been nicknamed \"the coronavirus slayer.\"In the second week of January --  before the state, and by extension India, had reported its first coronavirus case -- Kerala's Minister of Health and Social Welfare, KK Shailaja, noticed reports of a virus spreading in Wuhan, China.With many students from Kerala studying in Wuhan, KK Shailaja suspected it was just a matter of time before the virus arrived in the state. In late January, the ministry set up 18 expert groups for different facets of the outbreak control, covering everything from contact tracing and screening, to logistics and mental health. \"We planned everything,\" she says.From January 24, the government screened all passengers returning from China, and sent all symptomatic patients to designated isolation facilities. On January 30, Kerala confirmed its first coronavirus patient -- a student who had been studying in Wuhan. Authorities identified the first patient by screening all 172 passengers on a plane from Wuhan, and isolating three students who had minor symptoms in hospital. They were also able to trace more than 70 people who had been in close contact with the students, Shailaja said.How does India, a country of 1.3 billion people, have around 1,000 coronavirus deaths?And even when there were no new cases, the state continued being vigilant. \"Some asked us why we were being so overactive because there were no cases now in Kerala,\" she says. \"We were told we over reacting but we didn't withdraw our teams because we were reading about this virus going to other countries.\"As Oommen Kurian, a senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, put it: \"(Kerala) reacted as if it's a very deadly disease from the beginning when people were actually doubtful across the world about the deadliness of the virus.\" Back in 2018, the state was hit by an outbreak of Nipah virus, which killed 18 people within a few weeks. There is no treatment or vaccine for Nipah, which has a fatality rate of between 40 to 75% -- much higher than Covid-19.Kerala managed to contain the disease in a short space of time -- and the most important thing was contact tracing, Shailaja said. Indian citizens evacuated from Maldives arrive at the Cochin port in Kochi in the south Indian state of Kerala on May 10, 2020. \"We understood that for any contagious virus, the first thing we have to do is contact tracing and to break the chain,\" she said. \"If we trace the contact properly, we can isolate the person from others and we can break the chain and flatten the curve of the epidemic. This is the same thing we applied here.\"\"Kerala acted from the beginning ... and has not lowered its guard yet,\" said Rajeev Sadanandan, Kerala's former health secretary and the chief executive of non-profit Health Systems Transformation Platform. \"No other Indian state did anything remotely comparable.\"How Kerala comparesHundreds of miles north in the state of Maharashtra, health authorities haven't seen the same success. The state -- which has roughly the same population size as Japan -- has the largest number of cases of anywhere in India. Many of those are in Mumbai, one of India's most populous cities, which is home to a number of slums. According to Amey Ghole, Health Committee Chairman of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai, the city took the outbreak seriously \"from day one.\"\"On February 19, we found our first patient and admitted them to hospital. We were the first to stop flights from China. Maharashtra was the first state to lockdown the cinemas and malls,\" he said.Social distancing is a privilege of the middle class. For India's slum dwellers, it will be impossibleThe state took other measures. On March 16, the state health minister, Rajesh Tope, announced that it would use indelible ink to stamp the hands of individuals who have been asked to self-quarantine at their own homes to prevent them from going out. The state created containment zones and cordoned off areas, Ghole said. Authorities have been testing in slums -- which have been a big concern in India -- and increased the number of beds in quarantine facilities, he said. But according to Kurian, Maharashtra didn't act as quickly as Kerala. Like much of the rest of the world, they were biding their time. \"Maharashtra was reactive,\" he added, rather than proactive.Sadanandan said Maharashtra had no contact tracing system, so when cases showed up at hospitals, they had no way of using information about their contacts to prevent further spread. Once infection reaches the community, prevention doesn't work, said Sadanandan. In places where community spread has taken hold, it's already too late to put in place Kerala's strategy of quarantining high-risk people, testing and treating them, and tracking everyone they have had contact with. Groom Vitthal Koditkar, left, of Hirpodi village speaks with his bride Vrushali Renuse, right, of Pabe village and family members after their wedding during a government-imposed nationwide lockdown at Pabe village in Pune district in Maharashtra, India. \"Slums or any community are the endpoints. The battle is lost when it has reached the community,\" he said. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has repeatedly denied any community transmission across India.Unlike Kerala, Maharashtra hadn't dealt with a recent viral outbreak, so they weren't as prepared for the onslaught, Kurian said. Now, it's too late to bring in strong contact tracing, he said. If Maharashtra were to start contact tracing now, it would have an uphill task -- it now has more than 23,000 confirmed cases, who have likely each been in touch with a number of people. \"The thing about contact tracing is that it is very easy to get overwhelmed if you go over the threshold,\" he said. \"The silent spread has already happened in Maharashtra.\"Why Kerala's success isn't a surpriseIn a way, it's no surprise that Kerala has had success against the coronavirus -- it already has some of the best healthcare outcomes in India. According to government statistics, Kerala has a comparatively high number of public healthcare centers. It also has the lowest maternal mortality rate, one of the lowest infant mortality rates, and the highest life expectancy at birth of any Indian state, at 74.2 for a man.According to Sadanandan, Kerala has a good primary care system and well-trained health workers. Those things, in turn, meant the government health system had credibility and trust with the public, Sadanandan said.It also helped that Kerala's literacy rate is high, with around 94% of the population literate, according to the 2011 Census, compared with the national average of 73%. That improved the state's ability to communicate the risk, said Kurian.\"Education was seen as an investment in Kerala for a long time,\" Kurian added.Nurses light candles at Rajiv Gandhi hospital in Kochi, Kerala, on May 12, 2020, to mark International Nurses Day, celebrated on the birthday of Florence Nightingale.And Kerala is relatively well-off. In 2017-2018, the latest year for which statistics are available, it had a per capita GDP of 184,000 Indian rupees, compared with a nationwide average of 114,958. Kerala's health outcomes are not the norm. Healthcare -- and social indicators such as access to safe drinking water that influence healthcare outcomes -- vary widely between different states, Sadanandan said. Maharashtra's health outcomes fall far behind Kerala. Male life expectancy is 69.9, and its infant mortality rate is almost twice as high as Kerala's, with 19 deaths per 1,000 live births, compared with 10. Although Maharashtra has some of the best hospitals in India, according to Kurian, some of those have been compromised because the virus has spread to health care workers and within hospitals. Last month, the Indian Medical Association said doctors in India faced challenges of being attacked and had a lack of personal protective equipment.\"Many doctors have tested positive for the virus already and those of us working on the frontlines at government hospitals live in hostels where effective social distancing is not possible,\" a Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors spokesperson said.What the future holdsWhile Kerala has flattened the curve for now, the challenges aren't over. \"We are bracing ourselves for the 3rd wave,\" Isaac, the state's finance minister, tweeted. Kerala's chief minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, has a similar sentiment: \"Til those who are undergoing treatment are fully cured and those under observation complete their quarantine period, we cannot let our guard down one bit.\"India's lockdown is set to lift later this month, and some experts expect cases to increase. India stopped commercial flights into the country in March, but last week it began repatriation flights for Indians overseas who are stranded or lost their jobs. Kerala has large numbers of people working and living overseas, meaning many of those being repatriated will be headed for Kerala.And Kerala has the oldest population in India, making its population potentially more vulnerable -- 13% of the population are aged 60 or older, compared with the nationwide average of 8.2%. In Maharashtra, for comparison, 9.1% of the population are 60 or older. Indian citizens evacuated from Maldives look outside the Indian Navy INS Jalashwa ship as it arrives to Cochin port in Kochi on May 10, 2020.Kurian warns that it's not the time to be complacent. \"The real fight is just coming. Once the international travelers come back and the migrants come back and the local economy starts operating again, That is when the next wave will hit Kerala, and if they're caught napping, it will look a lot like Mumbai.\"In 2017, Indian workers around the world sent $69 billion back home -- and 19% of those remittances went to Kerala, the highest proportion of any state, according to India's Central Bank. But Kurian points out that if some of Kerala's overseas workers have now lost their jobs, that could impact Kerala's overall economy. \"Kerala is best practice sponsored by the rest of the world,\" he said. \"The money that is supporting Kerala's public sector response, that tap has been turned off.\"But Sadanandan is more optimistic -- he thinks the same prevention strategy that worked before can continue to work now.\"If prevention works with one, it can work with millions,\" he said. \"There would be hiccups but I expect the inherent strength of Kerala to survive the threat.\"CNN's Vedika Sud, Swati Gupta and Esha Mitra contributed to this story from New Delhi.",

        "content": "Seoul, South Korea (CNN)A furious crowd gathered in central Seoul last month to protest against the policies of a man who isn't even in power.Waving signs and wearing white sashes emblazoned with the words \"Vote for Women,\" they accused presidential candidate Yoon Suk Yeol of attempting to appeal to anti-feminists to garner support ahead of the election.\"You don't deserve to be a presidential candidate, Yoon,\" the mainly female crowd chanted. \"Go away.\"The protest highlighted how heated South Korea's gender war has become ahead of the country's March 9 presidential vote, with both leading candidates wading into the issue to win over young voters who are increasingly split along gender lines. Facing a hypercompetitive job market and skyrocketing housing prices, anti-feminists claim the country's bid to address gender inequality has tipped too far in women's favor. Feminists, meanwhile, point to the country's widespread sexual violence, entrenched gender expectations, and low female representation in boardrooms and in politics as examples of how discrimination against women is still rife.Feminist protesters at a demonstration on February 27, 2022, in central Seoul.Read MoreSurveys show a growing proportion of young men are opposed to feminism -- and conservative candidate and political novice Yoon is attempting to win their support. He's promising to abolish the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, which he claims is unfair to men, and raise the penalty for falsely reporting sex crimes. CNN approached Yoon's office for comment on his gender policies but did not receive a response.Meanwhile, liberal candidate Lee Jae-myung of the incumbent Democratic Party has tried to strike a more balanced tone. He says discrimination against men is wrong -- an apparent nod to the views of anti-feminist men -- but has also promised to close the gender wage gap. The ruling Democratic Party's presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung greets supporters on March 03.He says he'll keep the gender ministry -- but change its Korean name so that it no longer includes the word \"women.\" But in the last few days of the election, he appears to have accepted that he won't win the young male votes and is proactively courting online feminist communities.   In a statement to CNN, Lee's office said he had created \"many gender-related policies\" for women and men, including a quota system for women to hold at least 30% for high-ranking public roles, benefits for new mothers and expanded support for paternity leave.The heated election campaign has left women feeling as if the real issues facing them are being used for political point-scoring. And some worry that if Yoon wins the March 9 election, divisions between genders could widen even further. People cast their ballots during early voting South Korea's presidential election at a polling station in Seoul on March 4.The rise of anti-feministsSince the brutal 2016 murder in Seoul's trendy Gangnam neighborhood of a young woman targeted for her gender, South Korea has faced a reckoning over its attitudes toward women.Activists pushed to address sexual harassment and widespread discrimination and found an ally in outgoing President Moon Jae-In, who vowed to \"become a feminist president\" before he was elected in 2017.But in the years since, some men say the needle has moved too far. Anti-feminists point to statistics showing women are now going to university at a higher rate than men and say that compulsory military service for men gives women an advantage in the jobs market. Some place South Korea's demographic crisis, caused by slipping birth rates, squarely at the feet of feminists.While in other countries, anti-feminists might be discounted by politicians, in South Korea, these men have made themselves a powerful voter bloc.Last April, Moon's Democratic Party lost mayoral elections in both Seoul and its second largest city Busan, with exit polls showing young men in their 20s had overwhelmingly shifted their vote to the conservative People Power Party.And in May the Korean marketing and research firm Hankook Research said a survey of 3,000 adults found that more than 77% of men in their 20s and more than 73% of men in their 30s were \"repulsed by feminists or feminism.\"\"There is a sense of exclusion among men,\" said the 36-year-old writer Park Se-hwan, who identifies as anti-feminist. \"It's now time for us to discuss men in South Korea who in comparison have been largely ignored.\" Park says he agrees with gender equality but says this feeling of neglect has garnered \"a general objection to feminism\" among young men.Park Se-hwan identifies as anti-feminist.According to Youngmi Kim, a senior lecturer in Korean Studies at the University of Edinburgh, social polarization and a lack of employment opportunities for young people has led to men in their 20s and 30s becoming more conservative.Or, as Yun Ji-yeong, an associate professor in philosophy at Changwon National University, puts it: \"Many people are realizing that the (country's) scarce resources are being distributed very unequally.\"\"When they're looking for the cause, they point the finger at the women who are in front of them.\"The struggle facing feministsTo women, the fraught debate over gender isn't just leaving them feeling like a political punching bag -- they say it's also plastering over the real issues they're facing.Just 15.6% of senior and managerial positions are held by women -- significantly less than the US's 42%. Less than 20% of legislators are women, again well below most OECD countries. Digital sex crimes are so pervasive that they affects the quality of life for women and girls, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW), and women continue to face sexism and pressure to meet unrealistic beauty standards. Feminist protesters at a demonstration in Seoul on February 27.Yang Ji-hye, a youth rights activist, says many of the anti-feminist movement's claims are not supported by statistics -- and she thinks the way gender is being talked about in the election is \"absurd.\"\"I'm sick of these anti-feminist politics -- it makes me overwhelmed just to say how much women are being discriminated against, when at the same time they say there is reverse discrimination (against men),\" she said.Writer Park Won-ik says people with extreme views on both sides are engaged in a \"cultural war.\" He says it's difficult for others to express their opinions without being threatened. \"There's no effort of keeping certain rules as good citizens or as civilized people, whether you're feminists or not,\" he said.According to the University of Edinburgh's Kim, Korea still has a \"long journey ahead\" in terms of gender equality. Kim Ju-hee, who was at the protests, has felt discriminated against for her gender -- she's been told her looks were part of her job of being a nurse, and at home her female relatives are still expected eat at a small table at the back of the house  after ancestral rituals. She also feels frustrated about the way feminism has been used in the election. Kim Ju-hee, a nurse, at the protest in central Seoul on February 27.\"In this election, feminism is not viewed as an issue, but rather a token,\" said Kim, 27. \"I was very angry that it was used as if it was going to get discarded afterward.\"Yun, from Changwon National University, says if Yoon becomes president she expects feminists to face an even greater challenge for equality.\"Since the abolition of the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family is one of the most important promises, I think that it will probably be implemented as a tangible action first,\" Yun said.\"In that case, I have a concern that gender conflict and women's human rights may go further backward.\"CNN's Pallabi Munsi and Saeeun Park contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Hong Kong (CNN)India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi called him a \"dear friend.\" Chinese leader Xi Jinping went a step further, calling him his \"best and bosom friend.\" But Russian strongman Vladimir Putin's unprovoked assault on Ukraine has thrown Russia's previously warm relations with the Asian powers into question.Both China and India have refused to condemn Russia's brutal invasion outright, and both abstained from voting on United Nations Security Council and General Assembly resolutions demanding Moscow immediately stop its attack on Ukraine. But with the United States making clear it views countries that don't condemn Putin's war as aligned with Russia, the world's two most populous nations are facing increased international pressure to speak out -- or risk being seen as complicit. That neither country has chosen to do so has illuminated Russia's outsized influence in Asia, where arms sales and no-strings-attached trade have allowed Moscow to exploit regional fault lines and weaker ties to the West. Read MoreIn the US and Europe, leaders have framed their response to the invasion as part of a broader ideological battle to uphold democratic freedoms and the rule of law. But for two of Asia's major powers, those lines are more blurred, with experts suggesting India and China are motivated more by their own self interests. China and RussiaAs Russian troops massed on the border with Ukraine just weeks before Russia invaded, Xi and Putin had never seemed closer.In a 5,000-word statement as the Beijing Winter Olympics kicked off, the pair said Russia and China's relationship had \"no limits.\" The countries racked up a record-breaking $146 billion in bilateral trade last year and continued a tradition of joint training with a large-scale combined military exercise. The two share a 4,000-kilometer (2,458-mile) border, and China is Russia's biggest trade partner (Russia doesn't even make China's top five).A container train from Wuhan, China enters a railway station in Kiev, Ukraine in July, 2020.But the real key behind their tightening ties are their mutual tensions with Washington.Now their so-called limitless relationship is being tested. Already, questions have been raised over how much Xi knew about Putin's plans. A Western intelligence report indicated Chinese officials asked senior Russian officials in early February to wait until after the Beijing Olympics had finished before beginning an invasion. So far, China has refused to condemn the Russian attack or call it an \"invasion\" and has said it understands Moscow's \"legitimate security concerns.\" China's state media has also parroted Russian talking points on Ukraine. And on Wednesday, Guo Shuqing, chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, said China won't participate in sanctions.But Beijing also has links to Ukraine, which counts China as its largest trading partner. Ukraine joined Xi's flagship Belt and Road infrastructure and development initiative in 2017, and last year Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hailed Ukraine as a potential \"bridge to Europe\" for China. Freight trains to Europe run through Ukraine, and the country has been a major source of products like corn and barley for China -- trade that might not have been disrupted had Russia executed a swift regime change, rather than what looks to be a drawn-out, destructive invasion. In a call with his Ukrainian counterpart last week, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China was \"deeply grieved\" by the conflict. And while there's a chance China could benefit economically from a more reliant and isolated Russia, Beijing will also be worried its enterprises could become entangled in Western sanctions against Russia. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a development bank backed by Beijing, said Thursday it was suspending all of its activities in Russia as \"the war in Ukraine unfolds.\"China will also have to contend with potential fallout in its relationships with the West.As war breaks out in Europe, China blames the USRussia's invasion of Ukraine has united Western allies like no other issue in recent years and China's tacit support has not gone unnoticed. Some analysts have pointed to parallels between Russia's designs on Ukraine and fears over the future of Taiwan -- a self-governing island democracy that China's Communist Party claims as its own and has not ruled out taking by force.\"Ukraine is a wake-up call for Europe and North America and the other democracies,\" said Steve Tsang, director of SOAS China Institute at the University of London.  \"You will suddenly have countries in Europe and elsewhere realizing that they have to prepare for eventualities that since the end of the Cold War, over 30 years, we have not thought necessary.\"\"In that context, the assertiveness of China and the Chinese declared ambitions over Taiwan will get a lot more countries more worried,\" he said.  India and RussiaThere's an elephant in the room when it comes to India's relationship with Russia: China.India, the world's biggest democracy, has looked to counter China's growing influence in the Asia-Pacific region. One sign of that is India's role in the Quad -- an informal security grouping with the United States, Japan and Australia that's recently become more active. And it has a defense relationship with Russia -- estimates range upwards of 50% for how much of India's military equipment came from Russia. That equipment is vital given India's ongoing tensions at the border with China, which could escalate again. India also has a fraught relationship with its neighbor Pakistan, which flared into crisis at their disputed Kashmir border region in 2019.Meanwhile, India inked a $5 billion weapons deal with Russia in 2018 for an air defense missile system, though well aware of the sanctions America could impose through the US side's Counter America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).India isn't looking at the situation in Ukraine in terms of their relationship with that country -- it's thinking about the dangers in its own backyard, Happymon Jacob, an associate professor of diplomacy and disarmament at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, said.Indian students wait to board a train from Lviv, Ukraine to Poland, March 3.\"This isn't about going against the West or supporting Russia,\" Jacob said. \"(India's government) hasn't explicitly supported Russia, but they have to take a more careful, nuanced approach.\"So far, India has tried to play both sides -- Modi has spoken with both Zelensky and Putin, and has pledged humanitarian aid for Ukraine. Modi hasn't explicitly condemned Russia's attacks -- he's called for \"an immediate cessation of violence\" and \"concerted efforts from all sides\" to negotiate, according to a read-out of his February 24 call with Putin. Russia and India have a long history of friendly relations, which stretch back to the Soviet era when the USSR helped India win its 1971 war with Pakistan. There's also the relationship between Putin and Modi, who was one of only two world leaders Putin traveled to see last year, for a visit to New Delhi in December. \"India needs Russia to stand up to China,\" said Harsh V. Pant, a professor in international relations at King's College London and head of the Strategic Studies Program at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. \"It will have to balance its historic ties with Russia with its burgeoning ties with the West.\"The US' defense trade with India has risen from nearly zero in 2008 to more than $20 billion in 2020. And as Russia's war rages on, Putin may have less in the way of defense support to offer countries like India \"what with the incredible rate of attrition in Ukraine,\" said Ian Hall, a professor of international relations at Griffith University. And there's domestic pressure too -- after an Indian student was killed during Russia's shelling of Kharkiv last week while buying groceries, there's been growing calls within India to help evacuate the hundreds of other Indian students stuck in the northeastern city of Sumy, which has come under heavy bombardment in recent days. Self interest Even before Russia invaded Ukraine, this tangle of relationships was sometimes fraught. Now with widespread condemnation against its actions, Russia is likely to be considered a pariah state in the West. And that could make its relationships with countries like China and India even more important.  \"In (Putin's) first stint as President, he put a lot of emphasis in rekindling old Soviet ties with Asian partners,\" said Herv\u00e9 Lemahieu, director of research at the Australia-based think tank the Lowy Institute. \"He does have ballast in Asia ... and, as we've seen, he has more than just China to rely on.\" Both China and India are maintaining the friendship out of self-interest -- but for very different reasons. China has a \"clear interest\" in making sure people like Putin stay in power, says SOAS's Tsang. \"They share two primary strategic interests: one is to take the American global leadership down a notch or two. The second is to make the world safe for authoritarianism,\" Tsang said. But Beijing's support is conditional -- if the Russians are unsuccessful to the point that they can't aid the countries' shared aims, China could recalibrate its support, he said. Elsewhere in Asia, US allies South Korea and Japan have come out in condemnation of Russia. Singapore has also levied sanctions against Russia. And while the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) issued a statement last week that did not condemn or refer to Russia's actions as an invasion, eight of the 10 members voted in favor of the UN General Assembly resolution calling on Russia to immediately cease its use of force in Ukraine. Only Laos and Vietnam abstained.As for democratic India, security and development concerns may come first. \"In Asia, the fundamental challenge for most is China's rising power, China's huge force,\" Manoj Kewalramani, chair of the Indo-Pacific Research Program at the Takshashila Institution in Bangalore, said.     \"This binary of democracy and autocrats is problematic -- the world is much more complicated.\"",

        "content": "Kyiv, Ukraine (CNN)A Ukrainian delegation will meet with a Russian delegation on Monday for talks on the Ukraine-Belarus border following assurances from Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.The announcement came Sunday as Ukrainian forces engaged in fierce fighting with Russian troops in multiple cities across Ukraine.Russia is facing universal condemnation and increased sanctions from Western powers over Moscow's unprovoked assault on Ukraine, now in its fourth day. Ukraine's Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin said the talks would take place Monday morning local time.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had earlier said he would be willing to hold talks with Russia but not in Belarus, pointing out that Russian military actions are being launched from that country. Read MoreOn Sunday, Zelensky said in a brief televised statement that he doesn't expect much from the meeting. \"I will say frankly, as always: I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try. So that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,\" Zelensky said.Ukraine has said its air force shot down a cruise missile launched at Kyiv on Sunday from Belarus. Belarus is an ally of Russia and has played an important role in Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Zelensky's office said Lukashenko had called his Ukrainian counterpart on Sunday. \"The politicians have agreed that the Ukrainian delegation will meet with the Russian delegation without preconditions on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, near the Pripyat River,\" Zelensky's office said.\"Aleksander Lukashenko has taken responsibility for ensuring that all planes, helicopters and missiles stationed on the Belarusian territory will remain on the ground during the Ukrainian delegation's travel, meeting and return.\" Sanctions will put Russia's 'fortress' economy to the testRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered his country's deterrence forces -- which include nuclear arms -- onto their highest state of alert on Sunday.\"Top officials in leading NATO countries have allowed themselves to make aggressive comments about our country, therefore I hereby order the Minister of Defense and the chief of the General Staff to place the Russian Army Deterrence Force on combat alert,\" Putin said in a televised meeting with top Russian defense officials.Putin also said the Western sanctions placed on Russia were unlawful. A senior US official told CNN that the new development is Putin's latest attempt to manufacture threats to justify aggression.\"The only reason his forces face a threat today is because they invaded a sovereign country, and one without nuclear weapons,\" said the official. \"This is yet another escalatory and totally unnecessary step.\"\n\nAs the fighting continues, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have fled their homes and dozens of civilians have been killed, according to UN figures.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a briefing that Putin's order to put Russian deterrent forces on alert was a \"direct threat to us\" and an effort to raise pressure on the Ukrainian delegation at Monday's scheduled talks.Kuleba indicated that Ukrainian officials are willing to \"listen to what Russia has to say\" but will not give in to pressure. \"We will tell them what we think of this,\" he said. \"And what we are ready to discuss is how to stop the war and the occupation of our territories. Full stop.\"Kuleba said that, according to Ukrainian intelligence, even people within Putin's inner circle do not agree with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, \"because they understand the detrimental, the damaging, the devastating consequences this conflict will have for Russia itself.\" Fighting in Kharkiv, missiles in KyivEarlier Sunday, residents of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, awoke to find the city still firmly under Ukrainian control, despite two massive explosions some 30 kilometers, or about 18 miles, south of the city lighting up the sky overnight.Russian invasion runs into stiff resistance, supply lines are a 'definite vulnerability,' US officials sayAnd fighting broke out on the streets of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, after Russian forces entered the city, Oleh Synehubov, the head of the Kharkiv Regional State Administration, said Sunday. \"Do not leave your shelters!\" he posted on Facebook, warning civilians not to go out on the streets.\"Intensive exchanges of rocket artillery overnight have been followed by heavy fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces in Kharkiv,\" an assessment by the UK's Ministry of Defence said.Ukrainian forces had managed to deter the Russians from entering the northeastern city -- home to about 1.4 million people -- for the past three days. The city, which sits less than 20 miles south of the Russian border, was approached by Russian forces shortly after the invasion began.But despite being far better equipped, Russia has failed to take control of key cities, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists join efforts to defend their homes and families.Others are fleeing the conflict. The United Nations estimates as many as 368,000 Ukrainians are now refugees.The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said late Saturday that the United Nations \"reports at least 240 civilian casualties, including at least 64 people killed\" in the fighting in Ukraine. Damage to civilian infrastructure has deprived hundreds of thousands of people of access to electricity or water, the statement added. In a video message Sunday, Zelensky accused Russian troops of targeting civilians, including children, and called for an international investigation into the conflict.The Russian Ministry of Defense has previously said it is targeting only military infrastructure, saying in a statement: \"The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation do not strike cities and towns, they take all measures to save the lives of civilians.\"But Zelensky rejected this, saying: \"They lied when they said they would not target civilian population. Since the first hours of the invasion, Russian troops have been hitting civilian infrastructure.\"Ukraine is \"documenting their crimes,\" he said, adding: \"This is terror.\" Photos: Russia invades UkraineThe Retroville shopping mall in Kyiv, Ukraine, is seen on Monday, March 21, after Russian shelling.Hide Caption 1 of 175 Photos: Russia invades UkraineUkrainian servicemen search through rubble inside the Retroville shopping mall in Kyiv.Hide Caption 2 of 175 Photos: Russia invades UkrainePeople share dinner and sing \"Happy Birthday\" during a celebration in Kyiv on March 20.

        "content": "Seoul, South Korea (CNN)He risked his life fleeing from one of the world's most repressive regimes, traversing a militarized stretch protected by barbed wire fences. Then a year later, he went back -- the way he came. More than one month since the man crossed the demilitarized zone from South to North Korea, much of his life in both countries remains a mystery -- as do his reasons for returning to the isolated nation ruled by Kim Jong Un. South Korean media reported that the defector -- who hasn't been officially named, although fellow defectors say he was called Kim Woo-jeong in South Korea -- was a former gymnast who largely kept to himself. According to South Korean police, he was a construction worker in his 30s who earned money by doing manual labor. Man who crossed from South Korea into North Korea presumed to be North Korean defector, Seoul officials sayThe man's case is rare -- while more than 10,000 North Korean defectors have arrived in South Korea in the past decade, just 30 have returned home, where they face the prospect of being put into forced labor camps, according to official South Korean data.But defectors and advocates say even if the man's rationale for leaving South Korea is unclear, the fact that some North Korean defectors are willing to return to one of the world's most politically isolated countries only highlights how challenging life can be in the South for North Koreans.Read MoreWhy people defectSince the Korean War ended with an armistice in 1953, North and South Korea have been separated by an almost impenetrable border preventing anyone from crossing to the other side.Over subsequent decades, South Korea has modernized, becoming one of the world's richest and most technologically developed countries. Meanwhile, North Korea has become increasingly isolated, with citizens subject to widespread poverty and limited basic freedoms. So it isn't hard to see why people may want to escape.Since 1998, more than 33,000 people have defected from North Korea to South Korea, according to South Korea's Unification Ministry. However, numbers have dwindled in recent years after Kim imposed even tougher border controls to prevent Covid inflows. On very rare occasions, defectors -- like the former gymnast -- manage to escape through the heavily guarded demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea. The vast majority, like defector Kang Chun-hyuk, flee over North Korea's lengthy border with China.Kang's family made the trip in 1998 when he was 12 years old, before finally making it to South Korea a few years later.People gather before the statues of late North Korean leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il in 2021 to mark the 10th anniversary of Kim Jong Il's death.In North Korea, Kang remembers barely having enough food to survive.   Sometimes, his family would make a single portion of dry noodles into a meal that would feed him and his parents for a week.\"It wasn't worth going to school, so me and my classmates stole food like corn or potatoes,\" he said.According to a survey of 3,000 people released this year by the North Korean Refugees Foundation, food shortages are one of the most common motivations for defection, with nearly 22% saying that was why they had defected. The most common reason given -- at 23% -- was that people didn't like being controlled or monitored by the North Korean regime. Once they arrive in South Korea, there are measures in place to support them. Defectors undergo a compulsory, 12-week education session to help them adjust to life in their new home. They're given financial support and accommodation, and access to health care and employment services. But even so, life for defectors is often a struggle.  Finding work and fitting inBefore Kang Na-ra -- no relation to Kang Chun-hyuk -- defected in 2014 as a teenager, she thought her life in South Korea would mirror the K-dramas she watched in secret in the city of Chongjin.But South Korea was a far cry from the romantic world she'd seen on screen. Kang Na-ra's mother defected before her -- she does not want to say why -- but their life together in South Korea was not what she'd hoped.The North Korean border county of Kaepoong from a South Korean observatory at the southern boundary of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) dividing the two Koreas.Her mother worked long hours and was often away from home dancing in a North Korean defectors performing group to make ends meet. Although Kang Na-ra spoke the same language, she was lonely and had few friends in South Korea. Another defector, who asked not to be named or further identified for fear of repercussions for his family remaining in North Korea, said he also struggled with culture shock when he defected a few years ago -- even bright and colorful signs and the abundance of English words used in language in South Korea made him feel uncomfortable.\"You don't see things like that in North Korea,\" said the defector. \"I didn't like many things in South Korea at first.\"He also said many defectors found it difficult to get a job.Statistics for 2020 released last year by South Korea's Unification Ministry found defectors had a higher unemployment rate than the general population, with 9.4% of defectors unemployed, compared with 4% of the general population in December 2020. \"Getting a good job is important, but even South Koreans who are raised and educated here find it difficult to get a decent job,\" he said. \"You can imagine how hard it can be for North Korean defectors.\"  JUST WATCHEDMom and son defect from N.

Korea 02:11Kang Chun-hyuk's family was given a flat by the government when they made it to South Korea in 2001 after three years in China. But his thick North Korean accent made it hard for him to fit in at school and he dropped out. He worked in manual labor until he was 25 years old, unsure if he would be able to ever do anything else. For others, the struggle to adjust and find work can have deadly consequences. In 2019, North Korean defector Han Sang-ok was found dead in her apartment with her 6-year-old son after she failed to pay her bills for months. A water meter inspector noticed a foul smell coming from the apartment and called the police, who found two heavily decomposed bodies and an empty fridge, leading the police officer to note starvation as the suspected cause of death. Separation painsBut not all defectors have dreams of a bright life in South Korea.Kim Ryon-hui is a rare case of a defector who arrived almost by accident. The 54-year-old, who lived a relatively upscale life in North Korea, went to China in 2011 to visit relatives and seek medical care for liver disease. But when she arrived, she found Chinese doctors wanted payment upfront. Kim Ryon-hui desperately wants to get back to North Korea.Kim said a broker told her Chinese people often went to South Korea to earn money. So, she signed up for a journey to South Korea and left her North Korean passport with the broker group -- not realizing that meant she would never be able to return home. Kim feels hostility from South Koreans, especially when North Korea's leader fires missiles. She told CNN she struggled to adapt to a capitalist society governed by market pressures and to understand what she sees as a dog-eat-dog world. \"It's like we're oil and South Korea is water, so we can't mix,\" she said.  That's a common sentiment for defectors. According to the North Korean Refugees Foundation survey, while most people are happy in South Korea because they can live a free life and earn relative to how much they work, many are unhappy with the level of intense competition.In North Korea a packet of coffee costs $100, and that's a problem for Kim Jong UnBut the hardest part for Kim is the separation from her family. South Korean law prevents any communication with people in North Korea and South Koreans cannot travel there. Unless Kim sneaks back into North Korea, or the two Koreas reach a peace agreement, she has little chance of seeing her family again.  Kim last saw her daughter when she was 17 -- now her daughter is 28. Kim is only able to communicate with her family through journalists who take letters and gifts for her to North Korea, but that hasn't been possible since North Korea closed its borders due to the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. \"It's scary to be alone,\" she said. \"When I see lights on in other apartments in the evening, I imagine families having dinner together. That's the saddest and loneliest feeling.\"Why defectors returnDespite the difficulties of being in South Korea, the vast majority stay put. For most, that's because the benefits of staying in South Korea are far greater than the risks they face if they return.Seo Jae-pyeong, the director of the Association of the North Korean Defectors, defected in 2001. In the 20 years he's lived in South Korea, he's only known one defector personally who returned to North Korea.She was a doctor with a family back in North Korea who didn't realize her brother was bringing her to South Korea, he said.\"She didn't have a reason to defect and she couldn't get used to life in South Korea,\" Seo said.Anti-North Korea activists and refugees from North Korea attend a protest against a summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un, in Seoul on February 26, 2019. He questioned how many of the 30 defectors who returned to North Korea had left of their own free will. He said some may have been blackmailed or kidnapped near the border between China and North Korea. Others might have had major financial difficulties that left them with few other choices.Lee Na-kyung, a defector activist for single parents and people with disabilities from the North, said by the time many defectors arrive in South Korea they already have major debts to brokers who helped them cross the border. Some defectors pay their government settlement money to the brokers, and then sink further into debt as they struggle to find work, according to Lee, who defected from North Korea in 2005 after her husband was framed for a crime she says he didn't commit. For some, the hardship of life in South Korea doesn't meet their expectations. She knows of one man who was a high-ranking military officer in North Korea who could only find work in a junkyard in South Korea. \"He said that he would rather die at home instead of dying as a junkman,\" she said. What next?A month after the gymnast Kim crossed back into North Korea, it's unclear whether he is still alive. Although the South Korean military spotted him on surveillance footage crossing the barbed wires into the demilitarized zone, they failed to stop him, the South Korean military's Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Won In-choul said in a briefing in January. He was seen four times on security camera on the south side of the border, and once after he crossed the Military Demarcation Line. North Korea warns of 'crisis beyond control' in heated statements aimed at US and South KoreaAt one point, soldiers mistook him for a defector coming from the North. At another point, they went to find him. Later, they found no trace of him except a feather caught on a wire that they suspected had come from his puffer jacket. There were \"no unusual movements\" of the North Korean military over the incident, South Korea's Defense Ministry spokesman Boo Seung-chan said last month at another briefing. And while North Korean state media has crowed about past defectors returning home, there has been no mention of last month's defector in state news publications.For those in South Korea, it's a reminder that the country's policies to help defectors could still be improved. Last week, the South Korean government announced it was launching a new team to improve the safety of defectors, noting that despite its current efforts, some defectors were still \"experiencing difficulties settling into our society.\"But defector advocates were dubious about how effective those new steps would be, pointing out that support measures are in place -- they just don't work.Kang Na-ra on her YouTube channel. Even defectors who appear to have successfully made their transition sometimes struggle with the pull back to North Korea.Two years after she defected, Kang Na-ra told her mother she wanted to go back. But she didn't want to risk her life after going through so much to get to South Korea. Now Kang, 25, is a television personality and YouTuber with more than 300,000 subscribers who watch her clips about life in North Korea. Her income is unstable, but at least she's enjoying life. \"Still today, I wonder if I made the right decision,\" she said. \"Life here is tough.\"Saeeun Park and Seoyeon Youn contributed to this story from Seoul, South Korea.",

        "content": "(CNN)Newly released testimony from US military survivors of the August 26 attack at Kabul airport has cast doubt on the findings of the Pentagon's investigation into the incident, which concluded that nobody was hit by gunfire in its aftermath.  The testimony also adds to some of the questions raised in this week's CNN investigation, in which Afghan survivors recalled seeing people shot in front of them. Afghan medical staff in five hospitals also reported seeing gunshot wounds in the dead and wounded, and one doctor recalled removing bullets from four patients. The Pentagon had dismissed the Afghan accounts as the result of memories jumbled by the impact of the blast, or, in the case of the medical diagnoses, the result of inadequate examinations. The investigators have nonetheless accepted they did not speak to any Afghan civilians. The testimony comes in nearly 2,000 pages from the US military investigation that were released by US Central Command under a Freedom of Information Act Request from the Washington Post on Friday night. Most of the names of interviewees are redacted, making it hard to discern who each witness is. Yet from the details that remain it is clear numerous Marines reported shooting in excess of the three bursts of warning shots the US military investigation has stated were fired by US and UK troops, and did not harm anyone. Some of the accounts are detailed. One Marine, from the Female Search Team deployed to check Afghan evacuation applicants, is explicit about when and how she opened fire. She said she decided to enter the blast area to assist colleagues after the bomb detonated, and opened fire in thick smoke without knowing what she was targeting. \"I went in and saw a lot of Marines shooting by the jersey barrier. There was a lot of smoke,\" she told investigators in an interview dated 13 October. \"I couldn't see where they were firing. They grabbed me and I started firing my weapon as well. I don't know what I was firing at.\" Read MoreRead more: Horror at Kabul's gate to freedomPentagon stands by investigation of Kabul airport attack despite questions raised in CNN reportThe testimony provides an important perspective on what the US military knew as it drew conclusions that no Afghans or US personnel were shot. Their conclusions have stated that Marines did not come under fire in the aftermath, and only shot controlled bursts of fire at two suspicious military-aged males, which hurt no one.  However, in the documents, several Marines recall gunfire impacting around them in the aftermath of the blast, one seeing a round hit a window in front of him. They raise questions as to whether all the rounds fired have been accounted for by investigators, or whether they were all harmless warning shots. One Marine from 1st Regiment recalled in an interview on October 1 what he saw when he ran into the tower next to the Abbey Gate entrance to the airport where an ISIS bomber detonated his device. \"I saw Marines return fire. I heard three distinct shots hit the back windows of the tower. The third round impacted right in front of my face as I was closing the ballistic glass window.\"Another said: \"I could hear sporadic rounds snapping overhead for about 5 minutes. I didn't see any tracers but saw sparks when bullets would impact things.\" A group interview by investigators with junior Marines who were at the blast site, from G company 2/1 Marines, had many accounts of bullets impacting around the troops. One Marine said: \"While I was applying tournequets (sic.) I saw ricochets. Never saw a shooter.\" Another quote reads: \"I saw the shots hitting around us\". Another reads: \"I saw ricochets but didn't hear gunfire.\" In other excerpts, Marines suggested colleagues fired many shots back. It is unclear how many Marines were interviewed, as names of speakers are redacted. \"If there were only 2-3 shooters and the amount of our guys shooting back, they would've been done,\" said one. Another said: \"I heard that a recon guy dumped about three magazines of ammo that way.\" In some interviews, other troops say they did not fire at all in the aftermath, despite the chaos and possibility they were under further attack. Much of the testimony is consistent with the conclusions of investigators.A person wounded in the ISIS bombing attack outside Kabul airport on August 26, 2021. Clothes and blood stains of Afghans who were waiting to be evacuated are seen at the site of the ISIS bombing at Kabul airport on August 26.But the testimony also raises questions as to how thoroughly the US military assessed whether patients their medics treated after the blast were shot. US investigators have stated that medics treating the injured initially mistook injuries caused by ball bearings as gunshot wounds, as they looked so similar. One medic said: \"I think there may have been GSWs [gunshot wounds] sprinkled in, but that's inconclusive and wasn't medically worth trying to figure out. They would be treated the same.\" The US military investigation has insisted there were no gunshot wounds detected among any patients US medics treated on the airport, and no bullets were recovered. One US medic, identified as a \"68Z,\" the military designation for a senior officer often with medical experience, said: \"Originally, a lot of the wound (sic.) were classified as gunshot wounds, but they were actually because of shrapnel. But there were some gunshot wounds. There was a non-US patient that had a bullet inside the back of his head after small arms fire.\" The medic, whose name is redacted, said in the interview they saw 70 patients and: \"I was the person writing the patients on the board and assisting everywhere.\" Captain Bill Urban, a spokesman for US Central Command, said in an email earlier this week to CNN that the medic was contradicted by surgeons in the operating theater who said they did not remove bullets as they worked. He said the 68Z officer was \"was not a Medical Doctor or Officer, and was not administering medical care in the Operating Room\". The \"68Z\" does however, in the interview, say they were formerly a \"combat medic\" and an \"LPN,\" a licensed practical nurse.Urban said some of the testimony highlighted to him by CNN were \"examples of statements deemed less credible ... For each of these instances you describe, we had contradictory information from several credible sources.\"  Urban added: \"While there are conflicting statements, as well as inconsistent evidence, the investigation team drew its conclusions based on a preponderance of all the evidence collected, after careful analysis and synthesis.\" Biden to split $7 billion in frozen funds between 9/11 victims and Afghan humanitarian aid Urban also pointed to the likely impact of the blast on troops' recollections, and noted how investigators \"assessed credibility of Service Members based on their maturity and experience in operational environments.\" The documents appear to record mostly the junior Marines at the scene of the blast seeing rounds impacting around them. Urban added that medics at the airport providing care did not assess how patients were injured. \"Medical providers did not make forensic findings at HKIA and were solely focused on treatment,\" he wrote in the email.\"Many individuals and Leaders unaffected by the blast indicated that claims of incoming rounds were not accurate\", Urban said. Investigators during Friday's briefing at the Pentagon said the \"confined space\" in which the warning shots were fired \"caused an echo which created the illusion of a firefight\". Urban added: \"We have multiple sources unaffected by the blast that indicate those affected by the blast who claimed to fire their weapons did not.\"",

        "content": "Melbourne, Australia (CNN)For months, activists have gathered outside a rundown hotel in central Melbourne, calling for the dozens of refugees held inside to be freed.But on Friday, a different group of protesters had an unusual detainee in their sights: tennis World No. 1 Novak Djokovic, who is confined to the hotel as he mounts a legal challenge to the revocation of his visa ahead of the Australian Open.\"Free Novac [sic],\" read one protester's handwritten sign stuck to a tennis racket. \"Let Novac play.\"Australian Open organizers said Tuesday that Djokovic -- who has previously criticized Covid-19 vaccine mandates -- was granted a \"medical exemption\" from the requirement that international travelers must be fully vaccinated to enter the country.JUST WATCHEDDjokovic's detention in Australia sheds light on refugee crisisReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHDjokovic's detention in Australia sheds light on refugee crisis 03:40But Djokovic arrived in Australia this week to find his visa revoked, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison saying the 34-year-old Serb \"didn't have a valid medical exemption.\" Read MoreTennis Australia was advised in a letter as far back as November 2021 that unvaccinated players with a recent Covid-19 infection would not be allowed to enter the country based on public health guidelines, Morrison told reporters Thursday.Djokovic's legal team won an urgent injunction against the decision, but it remains unclear whether the defending Australian Open men's singles champion will be able to compete in the tournament, which starts January 17. Court documents published on Saturday by Australia's Federal Circuit show that Djokovic was granted a medical exemption to compete after testing positive Covid-19 in December. His lawyers are appealing the visa cancellation and did not wish to comment ahead of his court hearing Monday.People hold placards outside the Park Hotel where 20-time grand slam champion Novak Djokovic is staying in Melbourne on January 7, 2022.Djokovic case has gone far beyond an individual visa issue. It's prompted anger from people who feel the rich and powerful are getting an easy ride when it comes to Australia's tough Covid-19 rules, which have seen families separated for years -- but it's also angered anti-vaxxers who believe coronavirus restrictions are encroaching on their civil liberties. And it's prompted concerns from Australia's Serbian community, some of whom say Djokovic is being unfairly targeted.But Djokovic's situation has also highlighted the plight of asylum seekers in Australia. While the tennis star will ultimately either be allowed to play in the tournament or forced to leave the country, other detainees in the same facility have been locked up for years -- and face indefinite detention under Australia's tough immigration rules. Widespread outrageAs dozens of protesters from disparate groups of the political spectrum gathered outside the Park Hotel on Friday, there was one thing that united them: the push for freedom.Some were from Serbian cultural groups, singing and waving the Balkan country's flag, who saw Djokovic's detention as a great injustice against one of the world's biggest sports stars.\"I don't see why he should be stuck in a detention center,\" said Tara, a 17-year-old Australian-Serb and junior tennis player, who did not give a last name. \"Everyone has their own freedom of choice, vaccinated or not.\"Djokovic, who is tied with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal on a record 20 men's grand slam singles titles, has not publicly revealed his vaccination status but voiced opposition to Covid-19 vaccines and vaccine mandates in April 2020.A general view of the government detention center, the Park Hotel.Others used Djokovic's plight as an opportunity to criticize how vaccine mandates had curtailed civil liberties.One woman -- who gave her name only as Matty for privacy reasons -- said if Djokovic went home, she wouldn't watch the Australian Open.\"I used to go every year -- I can't this year because of the vaccine mandates,\" said Matty, who added she is unvaccinated.Another masked person, who declined to speak to CNN, held a sign declaring Djokovic a \"hostage of the communist state.\" But others focused their attention on the approximately 30 refugees held in the hotel. Authorities detain another top-flight tennis player over visa issues ahead of Australian Open Previously used by the Australian government as a Covid-19 quarantine facility, the hotel has been an Alternative Place of Detention (APOD) for refugees and asylum seekers for at least a year. Nearly a decade ago, Australia said no asylum seekers who arrived by boat would ever be settled in the country. Hundreds were housed at offshore processing centers for years, although some were sent to hotels in Australia to be treated for health conditions. The refugees still have little hope of freedom, and the conditions they are held in is hugely controversial. Standing in front of the Park Hotel, which is tagged with the words \"free them,\" Tom Hardman, a 27-year-old teacher, said he had come out in support of the refugees.\"I'm here because the loneliness and the heartache these men suffer from not knowing when they will be released is unbearable to witness,\" he said. Police stand guard at the government detention center.Oscar Sterner, 25, said he was opposed to both anti-vaxxers and the way refugees were kept in detention -- and said the real problem was putting an unvaccinated visitor in a hotel with refugees who required medical attention. \"Djokovic is a millionaire scumbag who has rightly incurred the anger of a lot of people in Australia,\" he said. \"He can't be bothered to get vaccinated to protect the people around him.\"What it's like insideDjokovic's supporters have hit out at his treatment, with the tennis star's mother saying her son is being \"treated like a prisoner.\" \"It's so dirty and the food is so terrible,\" Dijana Djokovic told reporters Thursday at a news conference in Serbia's capital, Belgrade. \"It's just not fair. It's not human.\"American tennis star John Isner also tweeted in support of Djokovic, saying keeping him in the hotel was \"not right.\"\"There's no justification for the treatment he's receiving. He followed the rules, was allowed to enter Australia, and now he's being detained against his own will. This is such a shame.\"JUST WATCHEDTennis stars react to Djokovic's Australian Open debacleReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTennis stars react to Djokovic's Australian Open debacle 02:08Australia's home affairs minister Karen Andrews said Friday that Djokovic is \"not being held captive\" and can leave the country when he chooses.\"He is free to leave at anytime that he chooses to do so and Border Force will actually facilitate that,\" Andrews told public broadcaster ABC. \"It is the individual traveler's responsibility to make sure that they have in place all the necessary documentation that is needed to enter Australia.\"Australian immigration laws allow for an up to three year re-entry ban into the country following a visa cancellation under certain conditions -- but it is unclear if Djokovic will face such a penalty.In a statement Friday, the Professional Tennis Players Association said Djokovic had verified his well-being.\"With the utmost respect for all personal views on vaccinations, vaccinated athletes and unvaccinated athletes (with an approved medical exemption) should both be afforded the freedom to compete,\" said the association, which was co-founded by Djokovic. \"We will continue to support and advocate for our members, and all players, in a manner that is acceptable to them.\"Australia vowed to never let these men settle on its soil. Some just got visasAccording to human rights lawyer Alison Battisson, who has four clients inside the Park Hotel, visitors without the correct visa for Australia are normally handcuffed and transported to an immigration detention center in an unmarked van with blacked-out windows. \"It is an incredibly traumatic and dehumanizing process,\" she said. Video of the Park Hotel shared with CNN shows detainees in small rooms that include a double bed, a TV and some chairs. Asylum seekers have access to a stairway that leads them to a rooftop where they are able to smoke. It's unclear whether Djokovic is staying in the same conditions. \"This is a window, we can't open it at any stage,\" said Adnan Choopani, one of the detainees, in a video filmed for CNN. While the hotel appears clean and well-kept in footage filmed by Choopani, there have been reports of issues in the past. According to Battison, there was a Covid outbreak in the facility last year, and detainees have reported finding maggots in their food.The other detaineesFor the 30 or so refugees held in the hotel, the media spotlight on Djokovic is difficult to swallow. Many have been detained for years -- and have little hope of ever getting out.Mehdi, who asked to only use one name to protect his family, escaped from Iran when he was 15 years old and has been held in Australian detention for more than eight years with limited access to education or health care. \"I've served my time,\" said Mehdi, who turned 24 on Friday. \"We are suffering, we are exhausted and we are tired ... you are in indefinite detention, which means they can keep you as long as they can, as long as they want.\"Cousins Adnan Choopani and Mehdi were 15 when they fled Iran. Now, they're 24 and still in immigration detention.Choopani said he and his fellow detainees were just sitting in their rooms, with many of them taking medication for depression. Choopani is Mehdi's cousin, and he left Iran when he was also 15. He dreams of taking a walk on a street or going out for a coffee. \"It's unbelievable,\" he said. \"I think this is just a nightmare ... we live in the 21st century, in a country who believes in democracy still doing this kind of behavior to innocent people.\"Although it's unclear whether Djokovic will be allowed to play at Melbourne Park this month, the tennis star will eventually be let out of the hotel.Craig Foster, a former Australia national team footballer who advocates on behalf of the asylum seekers, says he hopes at least some good can come from the situation.\"In one way, it's good for the world to see how Australia has been treating our entrants, whether they're asylum seekers or refugees, or indeed an athlete like Novak who has simply fallen afoul, apparently, on the documentation on his visa,\" he said. \"If anything, we're hoping that this entire embarrassing saga comes to place Australians in a position where they understand more the plight of these people.\"",

        "content": "Hong Kong (CNN Business)In the past year, two of Hong Kong's biggest pro-democracy media outlets were toppled after enormous government pressure, a series of arrests and police raids on their newsrooms. A third organization \u2014 the five-year-old Citizen News \u2014 announced last week that it would shut down, too. But unlike Apple Daily and Stand News, Citizen News didn't wait for police to come knocking before closing shop.\"If we cannot continue reporting the way we wanted to and the way we feel safe to, ceasing operation is regrettably the only choice,\" chief writer Chris Yeung said during a press conference Monday. In the 18 months since Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong, the line defining what can still be published without breaking the law has become increasingly blurred. That's made it all the more difficult for journalists to know what the authorities consider acceptable, and what could land them in prison for years. Hong Kong has fined a journalist for ticking a box. That shows the city's media freedoms are in jeopardyThat means Hong Kong \u2014 once home to one of Asia's most vibrant media scenes, and a place that professes freedom of speech and freedom of the press \u2014 has lost almost all its homegrown independent news outlets. And, while the government has dismissed the idea that press freedom has been undermined, the future of independent reporting looks increasingly bleak.Read More\"The government created this climate of self-censorship and fear, because the uncertainty of what is and is not illegal, and the uncertainty of what is and is not seditious is so blurred right now,\" said former Chinese University of Hong Kong journalism professor Lokman Tsui, who now lives in the Netherlands. \"On the one hand, it's a story of a bunch of outlets being forced to close down,\" he said. \"On the other hand, it's really the story of how professional reporting in Hong Kong is now so dangerous that you might end up in jail.\"Blurred linesCitizen News' announcement didn't come entirely out of the blue.Just days earlier, Stand News shut down after police raided its office and arrested seven people associated with the publication. The \"fate of Stand News\" triggered the decision by Citizen News, according to Yeung, who is also the former chair of the Hong Kong Journalists Association.The allegations against Stand News involve a \"conspiracy to publish seditious publications,\" which stems from a colonial-era crimes ordinance and not the national security law imposed in 2020. The Hong josKong police who raided the outlet's office are national security officers.Ultimately, Citizen News couldn't be sure whether the stories it was asking reporters to write would violate regulations, and opted to shut to protect its staff, said Daisy Li, the publication's chief editor.  Citizen News chief editor Daisy Li Yuet-wah and Citizen News founder Chris Yeung Kin-hing arrive for a press conference.\nTo many onlookers, the outlet was yet another casualty of the city's increasingly restrictive media environment. Like Apple Daily and Stand News, Citizen News published articles critical of government policies.The speed with which the industry has been \"gutted\" over the past two years is really dramatic, according to Sarah Cook, research director for China, Hong Kong and Taiwan at non-profit Freedom House. Nearly a year ago, the Hong Kong government announced it would replace the director of public broadcaster Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) with a public servant without any media experience. RTHK's program staff union responded by saying the station had lost its editorial independence. Since then, a partnership between RTHK and Chinese state media has raised concerns among press freedom advocates that the media group is increasingly becoming a propaganda outlet. Then, in June, hundreds of police officers raided the offices of long-running pro-democracy outlet Apple Daily. They arrested executives, froze its assets under national security charges \u2014 and ultimately prompted it to cease publication. \n\n\n\nPolice raid Apple Daily's offices in Hong Kong in August 2020. Credit: Apple Daily\n\"[Hong Kong leader] Carrie Lam is patiently unraveling the substance of press freedom in Hong Kong,\" Reporters Without Borders said in a December 2021 report on China's press freedoms. Lam has played down concerns. This week, she dismissed accusations that Citizen News and Stand News' shutdowns were related to the national security law and pushed back against the idea that Hong Kong's free press faced collapse. She claimed that the outlets made the decision to shut on their own. \"Nothing is more important than the rule of law in Hong Kong. And journalists and media organizations like all of us have to respect and comply with the law,\" she said Tuesday. \"If they are fearful of not being able to comply with the law, then they have to make up their mind and take the necessary decisions.\"What happens nextDespite Lam's insistence that there is still freedom of the press in Hong Kong, the number of independent media outlets is rapidly dwindling. Although there are still major international media outlets \u2014 including CNN and Bloomberg \u2014 operating large newsrooms in the city, there are few significant local independent outlets left, with experts pointing to Chinese-language inmediahk.net and the English-language Hong Kong Free Press as examples. A number of other outlets are either backed by the Chinese state, or have mainland Chinese owners. The city's largest English language paper South China Morning Post, for instance, is owned by mainland Chinese tech giant Alibaba. There's an expectation that any independent outlets will likely become targets sooner or later, said Hong Kong political commentator Joseph Cheng, who is now based in New Zealand.Chairperson of the Hong Kong Journalists Association Ronson Chan, left, and Chris Yeung pose during a press conference for the release of the organization's annual report on July 15, 2021. Ronson Chan, the chair of the Hong Kong Journalist Association and a former editor at Stand News until it closed, agrees.Free press might continue on a small scale, he said \u2014 but once outlets gain too much attention and resources, they will likely become targets.\"The media is in a ... serious crackdown,\" Chan, whose home was raided by police, told CNN Business. \"The chilling effect will affect many decisions for the management of the other media.\"One year after Hong Kong's national security law, residents feel Beijing's tightening gripFor now, international media haven't faced the same challenges as local media, although some foreign journalists have been denied visas. But Hong Kong's future as a global media hub is in jeopardy. Just weeks after the national security law was imposed in 2020, the New York Times announced it would move some staff out of Hong Kong to Seoul, South Korea. The Washington Post also chose Seoul as the location of its new Asia breaking news hub. In a Foreign Correspondents' Club survey of 99 Hong Kong-based journalists last year, 84% said the situation for the media had deteriorated since the national security law was introduced, and 46% said they were considering or had plans to leave the city due to the decline in press freedoms. For now, the media in Hong Kong is still nowhere near as restricted as in mainland China, where Beijing's so-called \"Great Firewall\" of censors severely curtails internet access and journalist visas are difficult to obtain.But the city's media environment is shifting to become more similar to the mainland. In the future, Hong Kong could increasingly find itself in a situation where media covered the city from the outside \u2014 just as media do with mainland China, Freedom House's Cook said. And, said Tsui, the city's internet could become more restricted, and could see authorities blocking access to articles it sees as controversial. Why this mattersExperts also point out that the loss of local, independent outlets in Hong Kong could also undermine the press' role as an important community watchdog. That echoes the struggles that media organizations have had worldwide: In the United States, for instance more than 1,800 newspapers have closed since 2004 and at least 200 counties have been left with no newspaper at all, according to a 2019 PEN America report.\"This is consistent across all countries, all cultures \u2014 if local journalism dies, corruption increases,\" Tsui said.The problem in Hong Kong, though, is that this trend of local media closures has been coupled with other attacks on democracy. Since the National Security Law was introduced, nearly all of the city's leading pro-democracy figures have either been jailed or gone into exile. A number of organizations and unions have disbanded or left Hong Kong, including the pro-democracy group that organized some of the city's biggest protests. And the national security law is no longer merely a threat \u2014 some activists have now been jailed under the act. Chief Executive Carrie Lam speaks at a press conference on December 30, 2021 in Hong Kong.\"The suppression of the pro-democracy movement meant that there was no toleration of an opposition, no toleration of checks and balances,\" Cheng said. And when Stand News and Apple Daily closed, both publications also removed years of reporting from the internet, taking with them a historical record of the city. \"It's an obvious attempt to remove the memory of Hong Kong people,\" said Cheng.There's also a reputational cost to Hong Kong, which has long positioned itself as Asia's world city. Following the raid on Stand News, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called on China and Hong Kong authorities to stop targeting the city's free and independent media, and uphold freedom of expression and access to information. \"These freedoms enabled Hong Kong to flourish as a global center for finance, trade, education, and culture,\" he said in a statement. \"By silencing independent media, [the People's Republic of China] and local authorities undermine Hong Kong's credibility and viability. A confident government that is unafraid of the truth embraces a free press,\" he added. Police officers carry news material and evidence in blue plastic boxes after searching the office of Stand News.\nDespite heavy censorship in mainland China, Hong Kong does remain relatively free. This has allowed it to act as a kind of gateway into the country, and is why so many businesses and media hubs have been based in the cityBut as Hong Kong edges closer to China, that's changing. \"Now even this little peek hole is becoming a black box,\" Tsui said. \"What the world is losing is an insight into not just Hong Kong, but also an insight into what's going on in China.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)During the global scramble to secure vaccines, many countries in Asia-Pacific were slow off the mark. This time, they're not making the same mistake.Countries around the region are rushing to place orders for the latest weapon against Covid-19: an antiviral pill that isn't even authorized for use yet. Molnupiravir -- produced by US pharmaceutical company Merck -- is being heralded as a potential pandemic game changer, especially for those unable to get vaccinated. Merck is seeking US Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization for the drug -- and if it's granted, the capsule will become the first oral antiviral treatment against Covid-19. Merck seeks FDA emergency use authorization for antiviral Covid-19 treatment molnupiravirAlready, at least eight countries or territories in the Asia-Pacific region have signed deals or are in talks to procure the drug, according to analytics company Airfinity, including New Zealand, Australia and South Korea, all of which were relatively slow to start their vaccine programs. Experts say while the pill looks promising, they worry some people will use it as an alternative to vaccines, which still offer the best protection. Read MoreAnd they caution that Asia's race to stock up on the pill could see a repeat of the vaccine grab last year, when wealthier countries were accused of hoarding doses as lower-income countries missed out.\"(Molnupiravir) really does have the potential -- the potential -- to change the game a bit,\" said Rachel Cohen, the North American executive director at non-profit Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative. \"We need to make sure that we don't repeat history -- that we don't fall into the same patterns or repeat the same mistakes that we saw for Covid vaccines.\"What is molnupiravir?Molnupiravir is seen as a positive step because it offers a way to treat Covid-19 -- without patients needing to be in hospital. The pill works like this: Once a patient is diagnosed with Covid-19, they can start a course of molnupiravir. That involves four 200-milligram capsules, twice a day, for five days -- a total of 40 pills.Unlike vaccines, which prompt an immune response, molnupiravir disrupts replication of the virus, said Sanjaya Senanayake, an infectious diseases physician and associate professor of medicine at Australian National University Medical School. \"In a sense, it makes the virus produce unhealthy babies,\" he said.Merck headquarters in Kenilworth, New Jersey on January 25, 2021. Interim Phase 3 results from a trial of more than 700 unvaccinated patients released earlier this month showed the pill might reduce the risk of hospitalization or death by approximately 50%, compared to patients who took a placebo. The participants were all given the pill or placebo within five days of symptom onset -- and within 29 days, none of those who took the pill died, compared with eight who were given the placebo. Full data from the molnupiravir trial has not yet been released, and the data has not yet been peer-reviewed or published.Wendy Holman, chief executive officer of Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, which is collaborating on the development, said in a statement the results were encouraging -- and she hoped the drug could make a \"profound impact in controlling the pandemic.\"\"Antiviral treatments that can be taken at home to keep people with Covid-19 out of the hospital are critically needed,\" she said. Experts agree the drug is promising. Rather than patients waiting to see if they get seriously ill, the virus could potentially be treated straight after they are diagnosed, said Cohen, from the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative.And unlike other Covid-19 treatments, molnupiravir can be taken at home, freeing up hospital resources for more seriously ill patients. \"Getting a tablet is so much simpler,\" Senanayake said. \"This is a game changer.\"What the Covid pill means for vaccinesVaccines are still the best protection, say experts -- after all, they can reduce the risk of a person getting Covid-19 at all. But even in Asia-Pacific, where vaccine rates in many countries have improved after a slow start, millions of people are still not inoculated either because they don't qualify, or they can't access shots. And that's where the pill comes in. \"There are lots of people that cannot get vaccinated,\" said Nial Wheate, an associate professor at the University of Sydney's School of Pharmacy. \"This drug will be a frontline solution for those people that end up getting sick.\"New Zealand and Australia were Covid success stories. Why are they behind on vaccine rollouts?But Wheate and other experts are concerned the pill may make it harder to convince some people to get vaccinated, compounding the vaccine hesitancy seen in a number of countries, including Australia.Research shows people prefer to swallow medicines rather than be injected, Wheate said. \"If you'd said to me a year and a half ago that people will refuse a vaccine for a disease that's wiping out the planet, I would have thought you're crazy,\" he said. \"There is always scope for people to think that this drug will be a much better solution than getting vaccinated.\"But experts say the pill isn't a replacement for vaccines. Senanayake says the approach is similar to how we treat the flu -- there's a flu vaccine, but there are also antiviral medicines to treat those who become ill. Cohen says the pill doesn't mean there's less urgency in scaling up equitable access to vaccines.\"Vaccine equity is sort of the defining challenge of our time. But you never fight an infectious disease with just one set of tools,\" she said. \"We really need the full arsenal of health technologies.\"Why Asia-Pacific countries are buying the Covid pillAccording to Airfinity data, 10 countries or territories are in negotiations or have signed deals for the pill -- and eight of them are in Asia-Pacific. Some of those countries may be trying to avoid mistakes of the past when slow orders led to delayed vaccine rollouts.\"I think we just want to make sure that we're ahead of the game when it comes to these other new developments,\" Senanayake said. \"There's a few middle-income countries in there that I think are just trying not to fall into the same trap that they were left in when high-income countries hoarded all the vaccines,\" added Cohen.It's not clear how much each of these countries will pay for the pills.The United States agreed to pay $1.2 billion for 1.7 million courses if the pill is approved, meaning the government is paying about $700 per course. An analysis by researchers Melissa Barber and Dzintars Gotham found that it costs about $18 to produce a course of molnupiravir based on a calculation of the cost of raw materials. Gotham, who researches access to medicines, said it was common for pharmaceutical companies to impose a large markup on drugs, but said he was surprised to see that high a price since US funding contributed to the pill's development. A woman receives a dose of the Pfizer vaccine on October 5, 2021 in the district of Gua Musang, Kelantan, Malaysia.Merck did not confirm whether those estimates were accurate, although in a statement to CNN, the company said the calculations don't take into account research and development. \"We have not yet established a price for molnupiravir because it has not been approved for use,\" the company said. \"We have an advance purchase agreement with the US government and that price is specific to a substantial volume of molnupiravir and does not represent a list price for the US or any other country.\"In a statement in June, Merck said it planned to use a tiered pricing approach for different countries, and had also entered into licensing agreements with generic manufacturers to accelerate availability of the pill in 104 low- and middle-income countries. A lack of equalityLower-income countries may be at a disadvantage when it comes to using the pill. Once the drug is approved for use, countries will need to decide whether to give it to anyone who shows symptoms, or to require a positive test before they can get it. But that requires access to testing. And in some countries that could be an issue, said Cohen. The interim results on the pill are for people who were given it within five days of symptom onset -- and in some countries, getting a test that quickly could be a problem.Rich countries are hoarding Covid-19 vaccines and leaving the developing world behind, People's Vaccine Alliance warnsNon-profit Doctors Without Borders hailed the drug as \"potentially lifesaving care\" for people living in areas where many are unvaccinated and vulnerable to the disease.First, though, is the question of how they can access it. While the drug would be simple to produce, according to Leena Menghaney, the South Asia head for the group's access campaign, Merck controls the patent and is able to decide which countries to supply the drug to and at what price. She renewed calls for a patent waiver that would waive intellectual property rights so that countries all over the world can produce versions of the medicine -- potentially saving many more lives. Earlier in the pandemic, activists pushed for a waiver for Covid-19 vaccines, but the request was blocked by a small number of governments, including the United Kingdom. Cohen said health tools and technologies should be treated as a public good -- and that the situation raised questions about how we can make sure those benefits are shared equitably. \"We are concerned that that could potentially lead to a kind of therapeutic nationalism,\" she said. \"What we're most concerned about, though, is that equitable access to antivirals may be particularly challenging in low- and middle-income countries.\"Senanayake said once again there was a risk of richer countries getting more than their fair share.\"With Covid, you have to be selfless to be selfish,\" he said. \"Otherwise, if you protect your own little cocoon, your own little country, if it occurs in other countries, then a new variant can emerge that can escape the vaccine.\"",

        "content": "Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN)Every day for the past month, Emal Ahmadi's 7-year-old daughter Hada has asked him the same thing: \"Where is my sister?\" She misses playing with her younger sister Malika, he says. She cries a lot, wondering when she is coming home. The tragic answer is that she won't return. Malika died in a US drone strike in the courtyard of their family home in Afghanistan's capital on August 29, along with nine other relatives, six of them children. The US military has since conceded it made a \"tragic mistake,\" admitting that all of the 10 people killed were civilians -- and none were associated with terror group ISIS-K, as they initially claimed. Read MoreIn a hearing Wednesday on the Afghanistan withdrawal, Gen. Frank McKenzie, the Commander of the US Central Command (CENTCOM), said the military knew civilians had been hit within four or five hours of the strike -- and they knew they had hit the wrong target within days. The testimony appears to contradict information supplied to CNN almost two weeks after the strike by a US military official who said the US had \"reasonable certainty\" that at least one ISIS-K facilitator had been killed.Emal Ahmadi, who lost 10 family members in a drone strike, mourns them at a Kabul gravesite.McKenzie had previously offered his \"profound condolences\" and said the US was exploring the possibility of ex gratia payments.But one month on from the strike, the Ahmadi family say they are yet to receive any word from the US military, let alone any compensation.The family struggles to pay for food, clothing and rent. They fear reprisals over their connections with the US. And they are desperate to get out of the country to safety. \"(The US) just showed to the world that they made an apology to us and fulfilled their responsibility,\" said Zamarai Ahmadi's sister Rohina. \"But they don't know what my family is going through, what we were and what we are now.\" A ruined family homeOne month after the strike, pockmarks scar the walls of the Ahmadi family home, hinting at the force of the Hellfire missile. The twisted metal remains of Zamarai Ahmadi's Toyota Corolla still sits in courtyard where it  -- and he -- was struck. But the home is empty -- the family have moved to a safer location in the hills of Kabul. The strike has made them vulnerable in more ways than one. The family's US connections through Zamarai Ahmadi's work are now widely known, and his death has left his wife and daughter without a husband and father in a country where women can't leave the house without male companions. Emal Ahmadi is still reeling from the loss of his family members.Zamarai Ahmadi was the head of the family who all lived together in the same compound, says his younger brother Emal Ahmadi. He was the breadwinner, made key decisions and had been like a father to him since their father died when Emal was just 8. \"Right now, once again, I think that I lost my father once more,\" Emal Ahmadi said. \"We don't know what to plan and what to do, how we should move forward, with no future we keep on living.\" A house full of life was turned into a graveyard.Rohina AhmadiThe family says they still haven't heard anything from the US beyond public statements. \"They have admitted their mistake, but they cannot give us back our family,\" Rohina Ahmadi said. \"A house full of life was turned into a graveyard.\" Even before the strike, the family were applying for visas to get to the US and out to safety. Now, that's even more urgent.  The California-based nonprofit Nutrition and Education International (NEI) where Zamarai Ahmadi worked has supported the family as best as it can, including helping them to rent another house, according to Zamarai Ahmadi's boss, who asked to only be known by his middle name, Walid, for fears over his security. They wanted a new life in America. Instead they were killed by the US military\"It's going to be so hard for his wife and daughter to survive in Afghanistan,\" said Sonia Kwon, a senior advisor at NEI. \"It's a very scary situation for them. \"They want a fresh start. I think that they deserve one,\" she said. \"I just hope the US government has the compassion to grant what they want.\" Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin told the Wednesday hearing that the US would continue to work through State Department channels to engage the family.\"If they desire to leave, then we'll certainly do everything we can to facilitate getting them out,\" he said.CENTCOM, the geographic command that oversees military operations in the region, declined to comment when asked whether it had reached out to Zamarai Ahmadi's family, if it was working toward resettling the family, and protecting them while they were still in Afghanistan. An ISIS-K safehouse?Not far away, in a northern Kabul suburb, colorful children's paintings and a whiteboard with homework hang on the walls of a modest house.It's the house NEI country director Walid grew up in -- the house he now shares with his three sisters, parents, wife and their three daughters, two of whom played happily around him, when visited by CNN.  They're a family of doctors and teachers, he says -- people who have helped their community. But in late August, the US military assessed that the family home they have lived in for 40 years was an ISIS-K safehouse. Art hangs on the wall at Walid's home in Kabul.According to a briefing earlier this month from a US official with knowledge of the matter, chatter following a deadly terrorist attack on the airport on August 26 led them to a so-called safehouse, which they monitored for 36 hours. There \"wasn't much activity\" around the house until a Toyota Corolla pulled out of the house on the morning of August 29 -- the car that would ultimately turn out to be Zamarai Ahmadi's. The US tracked Zamarai Ahmadi's car for eight hours before launching the deadly strike shortly after the car had pulled in at his family compound. NEI's country director Walid at home with his wife and two daughters.In a September 17 press conference, McKenzie said the compound where Zamarai Ahmadi's car first began being tracked was still assessed as being \"very definitely associated with ISIS-K.\" He claimed that just under 24 hours later, rockets were launched from that point to the capital's airport. This week CENTCOM declined to comment on whether it still maintained that the location was an ISIS-K safehouse.  But Walid says the claim of an ISIS-K connection is \"absolutely untrue.\" \"We have never been, we are not, and we will not be those kinds of people,\" he said. \"I do expect the US government to clear this label from our house. It is a damage to our dignity ... and definitely it puts us at huge risk.\"  And Walid says on the day of the strike he left home early to drive to the office, before asking Zamarai Ahmadi to collect a laptop he'd accidentally left at home. US operatives saw Zamarai Ahmadi pull into the house, and from that point they tracked his movements. Walid wants to clear his family's name after the US military claimed his home is an ISIS-K safehouse.The car's route and frequent stops that day seemed to confirm US suspicions that he was preparing an attack on Kabul airport.They saw Ahmadi and other men loading heavy containers into cars, which the US thought contained explosives.They were later shown to contain water Ahmadi was taking home to his family's compound.The day after missile strike, ISIS-K attempted to fire rockets at Kabul airport.Walid says the rockets came from a car parked around the corner from his house, not from his house as the US suggested.Walid has a US green card and desperately wants to be resettled there. As Kwon points out, as part of the green card process, the US have Walid's address.\"Why would you why would you give a green card to someone that you think is ISIS?\" Kwon questioned. \"It gets more and more absurd ... it's more than a mistake.\" Walid worries that the same thing that happened to his friend Zamarai Ahmadi could happen to him. \"It really is a nightmare for me. Some nights I jump from my bed because this is called a safehouse -- it could also be targeted.\" What happens next?Two investigations into what took place on August 29 are ongoing -- one directed by the Secretary of the Air Force, and one by the Defense Department's inspector general. Those investigations will consider what went wrong, whether someone should be held accountable, and whether any procedures around strike targeting need to be changed in the future. But experts caution these sorts of tragic strikes have happened before. Larry Lewis, an expert in reducing civilian casualties at nonprofit research and analysis organization CNA, said the issue of misidentified targets was a \"pervasive problem.\"\"When we look at the features of this incident, it's a tragic mistake,\" he said. \"But the features of this incident are just like dozens of other cases that I've seen.\" A pair of sandals sit on the car destroyed in a US airstrike in Kabul on August 29 in which 10 civilians were killed.An international explosives engineer, who asked not to be named for professional reasons and who reviewed CNN video of the scene, said: \"On the evidence presented, it looks like someone in the chain of command has lied.\"CENTCOM declined to comment on the accusation that it lied to the public. It also did not respond to accusations that civilian deaths were a pervasive problem and that there was little transparency. After weeks of trying to contact the Department of Defense, Kwon from NEI said Secretary Austin's office finally responded in a letter Wednesday. The letter, seen by CNN, said Zamarai Admadi's actions that day were \"completely harmless.\"But Kwon says she is surprised the US says it hasn't been able to get in touch with people on the ground, given that NEI has been supporting the family and working to get its staff to safety.\"If they were truly sincere, if you really mean what you say, you are sorry for killing his entire family ... then why haven't you talked?\" she questioned. \"What is an apology without appropriate action?\" she questioned. \"It's just words.\" Abdul Basir Bina contributed reporting from Istanbul.",

        "content": "(CNN)When New Zealand went into lockdown last week over a single Delta case, critics were quick to mock the country's risk-averse approach. British newspapers didn't hold back. The Times called New Zealand a \"mysterious socialist hermit nation\" where the public \"languish in a Covid prison,\" while The Telegraph slammed a once-welcoming country that had turned into an \"isolated dystopia.\" The reaction to New Zealand's approach speaks to a divide on how countries across the world are handling Covid. More than 18 months into the pandemic, some countries, including the United Kingdom, have accepted they may never eliminate the virus -- so instead, they're learning to live with it. New Zealand, by contrast, is one of the few countries still committed to stamping Covid out.Hours after confirming the country's first Delta case in the community, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern ordered the entire nation into lockdown, with the backing of a broad consensus across the political spectrum. Ten days later, the outbreak had spread to 347 cases, with one person in intensive care, as of Friday.Read More\"Fortress New Zealand\" -- with some of the strictest border rules in the world -- has been breached. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern talks to the media at a press conference on August 23, 2021 in Wellington, New Zealand. That's prompted questions over whether attempting to eradicate community transmission -- known as the zero Covid strategy -- still makes sense in a world swamped with the highly contagious Delta variant. For now, Ardern is doubling down on the strategy, even as neighboring Australia edges away from the approach. And for now, it seems the public remain on board -- even if it means being a \"hermit nation.\"But New Zealand's own Covid-19 response minister has indicated the approach might not last forever. The big question for New Zealand will be what its new strategy might look like. No urgency to reconnectUntil Delta arrived, New Zealand's tough border rules had protected it from the turmoil seen in most other countries.For most of the pandemic, the country has essentially operated as normal -- sports games, music festivals, public gatherings and dining have all gone ahead in much the same way they would have before the pandemic.So far, New Zealand has recorded just over 3,000 cases and 26 deaths. But the comparatively low death toll has come at a cost. An estimated 1 million New Zealanders live overseas, with nearly 600,000 in Australia, and many of New Zealand's 5 million residents likely have at least one friend or relative living overseas. Some haven't seen their loved ones in over a year.In March 2020, New Zealand closed its borders to almost all foreigners, and later required almost all returning visitors to spend two weeks in a managed isolation facility -- at their own cost. Spaces are limited to around 4,000 rooms a fortnight, and just over 167,000 people have passed through managed isolation facilities since March 2020.The fortified borders have also contributed to another major casualty: tourism. Once the country's largest export industry, overseas visitor arrivals slipped by more than 98% in January 2021 compared with a year before.  Manchester Street in central Christchurch is pictured deserted during the lockdown.Despite that, New Zealand doesn't seem to be in any rush to reconnect with the world. There's even an us-versus-them mentality among some social media users who criticize overseas New Zealanders desperate to get home for not returning sooner.That's because many still believe the upsides are worth it.A recent poll by public polling company Stickybeak found 84% of people surveyed supported the decision to move into lockdown last week. A separate Stickybeak poll showed only one in four wanted the travel bubble with Australia -- which had allowed for quarantine free travel -- to be reopened this year.  Charlotte Guigou, 28, a teacher in the capital Wellington, said going into lockdown was annoying, and it had taken a toll not being able to see her family in France. But she still thought the zero Covid approach was the right one. \"This lockdown was really tough, but before that we were just living life like normal, and it was all good, it was really chill,\" she said. \"It does seem like the pain of not having the borders open, for what we get in return, for the lifestyle we get in return, is still worth it.\"Anna Robinson, 32, spent much of the pandemic in Europe before moving back to New Zealand in April. Like Guigou, the strict border rules come at the cost of missing out on loved ones' important moments, such as births and weddings. But she thinks New Zealand's rules mean that vulnerable people or people with underlying health conditions are not being cast aside.\"Lockdown feels like a very small price to pay for the amount of freedom and safety for the community that will come after,\" she said.A different approach from AustraliaNew Zealand doesn't need to look far to know what can happen if Delta takes hold. Neighboring Australia -- once a proponent of the zero Covid strategy -- continues to battle a major Delta outbreak, recording another 882 locally transmitted cases in the state of New South Wales alone on Friday. One of Australia's biggest cities Melbourne has now spent nearly seven of the past 20 months in lockdown, according to Australia Broadcasting Corporation's calculations.In the past few weeks, New South Wales' Premier Gladys Berejiklian has conceded the state will need to learn to live with the virus. Last weekend, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the country needed to change its focus from cases to hospitalizations -- mirroring Singapore's tone in June when the city state said it would need to learn to live with the virus.\"Under our national plan, when we start hitting the 70% and 80% vaccination targets, we can start claiming back what Covid has been taking away from us. And when we do so, we must not be intimidated by the case numbers that will inevitably increase,\" Morrison wrote in an op-ed distributed to local media.Australian Defense Force personnel assist the public at a Covid-19 vaccination clinic in Sydney on August 18, 2021.But New Zealand is in a different situation from its neighbor. While New Zealand went into a nationwide lockdown within hours of its first Delta case, New South Wales took 10 days to impose a lockdown across greater Sydney -- and even then, the rules were lax. By then, the contagious variant had taken hold, leaving Australia with little choice but to recalibrate. \"Now they're struggling to keep it under control,\" University of New South Wales epidemiologist Professor Mary-Louise McLaws, an expert in infection prevention, said this week. \"I can't see them getting back to zero ... I think it's too late.\" That's not the case in New Zealand -- yet. Shaun Hendy, a Covid-19 modeler at Auckland University, said the country's swift response would likely allow a return to zero Covid cases.\"Certainly with Delta, the idea that you can ratchet up your response to Delta as the outbreak grows, that just simply hasn't been the case in New South Wales,\" he said. \"If you're able to pull it off, (elimination) was definitely the right approach,\" said Hendy. \"I don't think it's inevitable that we'll have a Delta outbreak that gets out of control.\"Epidemiologist Michael Baker, who advises the government on its Covid strategy, told national broadcaster Radio New Zealand this week that elimination had been the \"optimal strategy up to now by every indicator we can use.\"\"(Elimination is) technically possible, it's being achieved across the region. I'm confident it will be achieved again in New Zealand,\" he said. When to drop zero Covid?Australian Prime Minister Morrison has criticized the idea of pursuing an elimination strategy forever, calling it \"absurd.\"\"Covid is a new, different world. We need to get out there and live in it. We can't stay in the cave, and we can get out of it safely,\" he said this week.While New Zealand hasn't gone that far yet, New Zealand's Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said the Delta variant raised questions about the long-term viability of the elimination strategy.\"It does mean that all of our existing protections start to look less adequate and less robust,\" he said. \"As a result of that, we are looking very closely at what more we can do there. But it does raise some very big questions about the long-term future of our plans.\"Neither country is opening up right now -- doing so could be deadly. After struggling to get supply, New Zealand has one of the lowest Covid-19 vaccination rates in the OECD, with just over 20% of the population fully immunized. Australia -- which has had a vaccine rollout beset with problems -- isn't much further ahead, with 25% of the entire population immunized. Government figures put the number of fully vaccinated adults at 33% -- and its opening up is contingent on that figure reaching 70% to 80%.\"We're saying to everybody get vaccinated, get fully vaccinated, you still have time to make sure that when we start opening up, you have those options to live a more freer life,\" Berejiklian said. An information board in a deserted check-in hall at the Auckland Airport on July 7, 2020. But while Australia has signaled how it could move away from zero Covid in the next few months, there's little clarity about when or if New Zealand will do the same. Across the world, experts have said Covid may be like the flu in future -- something that can kill, but something we live with. Hendy has another comparison: once New Zealand has high rates of vaccination -- perhaps between 70% and 80% -- Covid could be treated like the measles.\"We don't lock down for measles. But we also don't tolerate it in the community -- we mount a public health response to eliminate measles when we have an outbreak.\"Earlier this month, a Strategic Covid-19 Public Health Advisory Group said the elimination strategy could still continue, even after New Zealand reopened its borders. On its website, the Ministry of Health explains that it will use a combination of border rules, vaccinations and public health measures to keep people safe from Covid. The country will still try to stamp out the virus -- but it may mean it relies less on lockdowns. \"Our Elimination Strategy has proved its worth and remains an achievable goal even when current border restrictions are eased,\" the Ministry of Health says on its website. In short, New Zealand is not planning to live with Covid in the same way as other countries.That may offer the potential for life to go on largely as it did before the pandemic -- but it means an immediate future mostly closed to the world.CNN's Angus Watson contributed to this story from Sydney, Australia.",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)As coronavirus cases rise across the South, state health officials, hospital consultants and oxygen suppliers continue to sound alarms over a potential shortage of medical grade oxygen to treat Covid-19 patients in the region. The Biden administration is working with and remains in close contact with oxygen suppliers and home health care agencies, industry trade groups, interagency partners and the private sector to closely monitor the situation and support as needed, a Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said.Over the weekend, health industry sources told CNN that hospitals across Florida, South Carolina, Texas and Louisiana have experienced oxygen shortages, with some at risk of moving to their reserve supplies or even running out of oxygen imminently. At least one hospital group said it was reaching out to the federal government for help.\"As Covid has continued to evolve, we have continued to see Covid care best practices continue to evolve, and that in part has been the use of high-flow oxygen versus ventilators,\" according to Donna Craft, the senior director of facilities and construction at Premier, a health care performance improvement company. \"That has had an absolute increase in positive outcomes for patients and better patient care.\"But unlike ventilators, medical grade oxygen isn't stored in the Strategic National Stockpile. Craft told CNN that the spike in Covid-19 cases has caused more demand on the oxygen supply and hospitals cannot keep pace.Read More\"Normally, an oxygen tank would be about 90% full, and the suppliers would let them get down to a refill level of 30-40% left in their tank, giving them a three- to five-day cushion of supply. What's happening now is that hospitals are running down to about 10-20%, which is a one- to two-day supply on hand before they're getting backfilled,\" Cross explained. \"Even then, when they're getting backfill, they're only getting a partial fill back to about a 40, sometimes 50% level.\"Two church events in Illinois linked to 180 Covid-19 cases, 5 hospitalizationsThe Compressed Gas Association, whose members are seeing three to five times the normal usage of oxygen, is reallocating product from the industrial sector to the health care sector to help mitigate the problem. Additionally, some of the large suppliers are shipping product from other regions to add supply to the areas with high demand. One state health official noted that while this was a short-term fix, there was concern that the movement could lead to shortages in other regions, should they later experience a spike in cases.During the first wave of Covid-19, other businesses and industries that use oxygen -- such as restaurants, welding and manufacturing plants -- were deemed nonessential businesses and were closed, allowing hospitals to gain access to a majority of the country's supplied oxygen. Now the combination of less supply, a shortage of drivers needed to transport oxygen and limitations on how long those drivers are allowed to be on the road carrying a hazardous material has created a dire situation for hospitals in multiple states, including those with some of the highest numbers of new coronavirus cases. The situation has been particularly bad in Florida, where driving across the state can take hours and accessing remote areas with only one entrance and exit point complicates distribution.\"We've had some very challenging situations over the last couple of weeks, where hospitals have had their oxygen deliveries disrupted with hours delay, putting them in a situation where they've had very low oxygen supplies. There were a number of hospitals that were down below 48 hours of oxygen,\" said Mary Mayhew, the president and CEO of the Florida Hospital Association. Mayhew added that the situation seemed to be stabilizing Saturday, as the state began to experience a reduction in hospitalizations, but much concern remained: \"Hospitals are using 3-4 times the amount of oxygen they would normally use. This is a life-sustaining supply, and hospitals are continuing to use oxygen around the clock. ... That certainly may cause challenges for the reliability of supply in Florida, even as our Covid hospitalizations start to decrease.\"Premier has reached out to multiple federal agencies over the last week, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the US Department of Health and Human Services, on behalf of struggling hospitals in its network.\"It is very critical situation,\" Craft said, adding that oxygen suppliers she works with have said they need help.One health official working with states and federal agencies on the problem told CNN there needs to be a coordinated response. \"We understand that there's hurricanes and floods and forest fires going on across the country, so it's not like there aren't distractions, but it is serious and it needs a much better strategy and communication plan around it -- period. It's life and death,\" the health official said.",

'There is no room to put these bodies,' Alabama health official says as Covid-19 deaths climb \"Normally, an oxygen tank would be about 90% full, and the suppliers would let them get down to a refill level of 30-40% left in their tank, giving them a three- to five-day cushion of supply,\" said Cross. \"What's happening now is that hospitals are running down to about 10-20%, which is a one- to two-day supply on hand, before they're getting backfilled.\"Even when they're getting backfill, it's only a partial supply of about 50%, Cross said. \"It is very critical situation.\"Read MoreFlorida on Saturday had the highest Covid-19 hospitalization rate in the country, with 75 patients per 100,000 residents in hospitals with the virus, according to data from federal health officials and Johns Hopkins University. It also reached yet another pandemic high of Covid-19 cases Friday, reporting 690.5 new cases per 100,000 people each day from August 20 to August 26, state data showed. Portable morgues for Central FloridaCovid-19 deaths have increased so much that the Central Florida Disaster Medical Coalition, a federally funded nonprofit that aids in preparing health care system response, has purchased 14 portable morgues with the capacity of 12 decedents each, coalition Executive Director Lynne Drawdy said. She said that the organization has met with hospitals in the region to find out what their needs are. The hospitals relayed that in the last week more morgue space was the highest priority because there was not adequate capacity -- and that they have seen delays in funeral homes picking up those who have died. Dr. Ahmed Elhaddad, an intensive care unit doctor in Florida, told CNN's Pamela Brown on Saturday that he's frustrated and \"tired of seeing people die and suffer because they did not take a vaccine.\" He said the Delta variant is \"eating\" people's lungs, which eventually leads to their collapse. \"We're seeing the patients die faster with this (Delta) variant,\" said Elhaddad, who is the ICU medical director at Jupiter Medical Center. A respiratory therapist treats a COVID-19 patient in a NCH Healthcare System's ICU on August 9 in Naples, Florida.\"This round, we're seeing the younger patients -- 30-, 40-, 50-year-olds -- and they're suffering. They're hungry for oxygen, and they're dying. Unfortunately, this round they're dying faster,\" he said.The government's top infectious diseases expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, told CNN's Jake Tapper that the US could see an additional 100,000 deaths from Covid-19 by December, as predicted by a University of Washington model. \"What is going on now is both entirely predictable, but entirely preventable. And you know we know we have the wherewithal with vaccines to turn this around,\" Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said.Elhaddad noted that his ICU does not have a single Covid-19 patient who is vaccinated, nor did he see any vaccinated people die from Covid-19. \"There's no magic medicine. ... The only thing that we're finding is that the vaccine is preventing death. It's preventing patients from coming to the ICU,\" Elhaddad said. Fauci pointed to the 80 million Americans who are eligible for the vaccine, but who are not vaccinated. \"We could turn this around and we could do it efficiently and quickly if we just get those people vaccinated,\" he said.Florida has fully vaccinated 52.4% of its total population, data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed Saturday. Meanwhile, less than 50% of people in South Carolina, Louisiana and Texas -- where oxygen supplies are also low -- are fully vaccinated. Studies have shown that full vaccination is necessary for optimal protection against the Delta variant. Nationally, 52.1% of the population was fully vaccinated as of Saturday, CDC data shows.Hurricane Ida targeting Louisiana as Covid-19 hospitalizations remain high Louisiana's overall vaccination rate remains among the lowest in the nation at 41.2% -- and the state's hospitals are dealing with hundreds of Covid-19 patients as Hurricane Ida slams the region. Some 2,450 people were hospitalized with Covid-19 in Louisiana, Gov. John Bel Edwards said Saturday, which is a drop of 20% in the past 10 days. But it's still the most the state has had since before the current surge in cases, Edwards told CNN's Jim Acosta. More than 475 of those patients are on ventilators, according to data from the state department of health.'Time is not on our side.' Gulf Coast braces for Sunday arrival of Hurricane Ida, potentially a Category 4 stormHurricane Ida made landfall near Port Fourchon, Louisiana, on Sunday as a dangerous Category 4 hurricane. Possible injuries from the storm stand to compound the risk of health care facilities being overwhelmed, given Covid-19 patients already occupy hospitals at high rates. \"Evacuating hospitals is not going to be possible because there's nowhere to bring those patients to, there's no excess capacity anywhere else in the state or outside the state,\" Edwards said.\"Then you have people who may be injured as a result of the hurricane itself, and so we need to make sure we have some capacity for them,\" he said.  \"We still have a very, very challenging situation here across the state of Louisiana.\"Edwards pointed out that he's worried about lengthy power outages. The state has about 10,000 lineworkers ready to go and another 20,000 on standby to assist as soon as necessary. \"Restoring power is going to be critically important in order to keep these hospitals up and functioning,\" he said.  All of the state's parishes are in the highest risk category for coronavirus, with widespread, uncontrolled transmission, and many undetected cases, the state health department said.'We're headed into a really tough time for young people,' doctor saysA return to in-person learning has led to thousands of students having to quarantine across the US, with Covid-19 cases among children surging to levels not seen since winter.And hospitalizations of children due to Covid-19 could continue to increase as more of them return to classrooms this fall.\"There is no question that we're headed into a really tough time for young people,\" Dr. Esther Choo told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Saturday.US Surgeon General urges parents and officials take these steps to protect children from Covid-19Choo, a professor of emergency medicine at Oregon Health & Science University, added that while people had some reassurance last year that the virus wouldn't affect children as severely, this year is different.\"We're going back to school in-person, unmasked across the United States. There's a lot of resistance to things like mask mandates and vaccinations that would keep our kids safer in schools,\" she said. Notably, children under 12 are not yet eligible to be vaccinated against Covid-19. Not all schools in the US have opened yet, but the remaining ones are expected to open after Labor Day, which is when Choo said children's Covid-19 hospitalizations could increase.\"We're no doubt going to see more of what we're seeing now, which is hospitals just bursting with pediatric admissions,\" she said, noting Covid-19 deaths of children will also become more common. Fauci said he supports mandating Covid-19 vaccines for students who are eligible, noting, \"This is not something new. We have mandates in many places in schools, particularly public schools that if in fact you want a child to come in, we've done this for decades and decades requiring polio, measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis,\" vaccinations.CNN's Kristen Holmes, Amanda Watts, Rebekah Riess, Lauren Mascarenhas, Taylor Romine, Elizabeth Joseph and Claire Colbert contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Top Biden health officials and some White House officials are holding preliminary conversations on revising mask recommendations for vaccinated Americans as the Delta variant spreads throughout the US, according to multiple sources familiar with discussions. Officials have weighed whether guidance should be revisited after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention dropped its mask mandate for vaccinated individuals earlier this year. Under discussion is what messages on masking the White House offer and what guidance the CDC should issue, the sources say. White House officials have repeatedly said it will be up to the CDC whether to change official guidance. \"At the White House, we follow the guidance and advice of health and medical experts. Public health guidance is made by the CDC, and they continue to recommend that fully vaccinated individuals do not wear a mask. If you are not vaccinated, you should be wearing a mask,\" a White House official told CNN.Administration officials insistent that science will guide the process, acutely aware that any official or non-official changes to mask rules would be a psychological blow for a country well into its second year of pandemic-related restrictions. When President Joe Biden emerged in the Rose Garden in May to herald the CDC announcement that masks were no longer required for vaccinated Americans, he declared it \"a great day in America;\" new guidance to mask up would inevitably underscore the not-so-great predicament currently facing the nation.But now that the Delta variant makes up over 80% of cases in the US, officials have weighed whether vaccinated people should begin wearing masks again indoors.Read MoreThese discussions were given new urgency this week after the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that everyone over the age of 2 wear masks when they return to school. One source familiar with the conversations said the administration is also considering recommendations that more heavily emphasize Americans should follow local guidance when it comes to wearing a mask indoors or for children at school.The Washington Post first reported the renewed mask discussions.The Biden White House has been careful not to overstep with the nation's top health agencies, a break from the previous administration, and one official insisted that any updated guidance would have to come from the CDC itself. According to one source familiar with internal discussions, the health agency is internally reconsidering its stance on mask orders. A third person familiar with the ongoing talks said they aren't far enough along yet to make a determination on masks but are weighing the best way to proceed.\"At this time, we have no intention of changing our masking guidance,\" CDC spokesman Jason McDonald told CNN.Another source in communication with the White House said officials they spoke with showed little appetite for any sort of federal mask mandate, expressing hesitancy of wading into what has now become a political flash point.Biden's White House5 takeaways from President Joe Biden's CNN town hallBiden warns about conspiracies flourishing in the US: 'The rest of the world's wondering about us'Biden believes kids under 12 will be able to get Covid-19 vaccines 'soon,' but it's up to scientistsOn the AAP decision, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden's chief medical adviser and the nation's top infectious disease expert, said he believed the recommendation was made as \"the extra step of caution,\" adding that the CDC is looking carefully at the AAP recommendations and \"hopefully we'll have some now concordance of the recommendations.\"In the meantime, the White House continues to hold calls with governors lead by Jeff Zients, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, and a rotation of other administration officials, multiple state sources said. The sessions are informative and data driven, rather than offering advice or guidance, the sources said. State and local health officials that talked to CNN were mixed on whether they wanted additional mandates or recommendations from the  federal government. One Republican state official said that their state was unlikely to follow any sort of new masking guidance, regardless of an increase in cases.The CDC has also been in regular in touch with state officials on potential mask orders and other mitigation steps.\"The CDC has been spending a lot of time trying to work through the issue of masking and figure out what to do next, and whether or not they need to be reconsidering things,\" Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said. \"They're really struggling with it.\"Some local health officials are hoping for updated federal guidance as cases continue to spike to help with mitigation.\"What we're seeing is some resistance from local health departments to step in front of the CDC guidance, but they might have to,\" Lori Freeman, the chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, said, noting that Los Angeles county had just taken the step of implementing a mask mandate. \"However, community by community making those decisions when the whole of the country seems to have rising cases can be problematic with what we've been through with the politicization of the public orders.\"CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story contained an incorrect reference to the pediatrics group that recommended everyone over the age of 2 wear masks when they return to school.

        "content": "(CNN)The Department of Energy is moving to reverse a Trump-era rule that rolled back water efficiency standards for showerheads, an administration official confirmed to CNN on Friday.The Trump-era showerhead rule took aim at the 2.5-gallon-per-minute maximum flow rate set by Congress in the 1990s. During the Obama administration, each showerhead in a fixture counted toward that limit collectively -- but the Energy Department under then-President Donald Trump moved to let each showerhead reach the 2.5-gallon-per-minute individually.The new proposal from President Joe Biden's administration would revert to the showerhead standards set by the Obama administration. The proposed action is set to be published in the Federal Register, after which it will undergo a 60-day public comment period.This proposed reversal was first reported by The Associated Press.A Biden administration official told CNN these water efficiency standards saved Americans money and conserved water and energy.Read MoreThrough 2020, the official said these standards had saved consumers $111.1 billion dollars in energy and water bills, 4.8 quads of energy and 4.3 trillion gallons of water.Those water savings equated to 107.5 billion baths of water with a 40-gallon average bath, the official said, which is equivalent to 63% of the water in Lake Champlain.The Trump-era rollbacks, which were finalized in December 2020, were heavily criticized at the time by environmental advocates and consumer and appliance standards groups as wasteful and unnecessary. Andrew deLaski, the executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, said in a statement at the time that \"changing the rules to address one of President Trump's pet peeves is simply silly.\" He said the rollbacks allowed \"for products that needlessly waste energy and water, are ridiculous and out of step with the climate crisis and the long-term drought facing much of the country.\" Trump often spoke publicly about how much he disliked poor water flow and lamented it interfered with his quest for \"perfect\" hair.\"So, showerheads -- you take a shower, the water doesn't come out. You wash your hands, the water doesn't come out. So what do you do? You just stand there longer, or you take a shower longer? Because my hair -- I don't know about you, but it has to be perfect. Perfect,\" Trump said last year. Trump also claimed that Americans were flushing their toilets \"10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once.\"In addition to the showerhead rule, in December 2020 the DOE established separate product classes for residential washers and dryer units that have cycle times of less than 30 minutes and meet lower efficiency standards. The moves were some of the final examples of Trump's Energy Department taking aim at standards on consumer appliances and dismantling environmental regulations. Trump's Energy Secretary, Dan Brouillette, said in a statement when the rollbacks were finalized that the Trump administration was affirming its commitment to \"reducing regulatory burdens and safeguarding consumer choice.\" This story has been updated with additional information.

        "content": "(CNN)The Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday an additional $50 million in funding to enhance air pollution monitoring and improve air quality in low-income communities and communities of color. The announcement of new funds comes as the agency ramps up its investments in environmental justice initiatives, a core focus of the Biden administration's climate policies.Communities of color have historically been among the most affected by unfavorable environmental policies, and poor air pollution is just one impact, EPA administrator Michael Regan said in an interview with CNN.\"Communities of color and environmental justice communities have been impacted by a number of systemic policy decisions that have been made, whether it be transportation, looking at roads and highways that cut through the heart of many of these communities, whether you look at failed drinking water systems ... or whether you look at facilities that spew pollution in closer proximity than other communities,\" Regan said.More than 40% of Americans live in areas with unhealthy air quality, and people of color are most negatively affected by it, according to a recent report from the American Lung Association. Low-income communities also face higher health risks from air pollution, the association reported. The report outlines a variety of reasons for these health inequities, including that pollution sources like power plants, highways and industrial facilities were often placed in low-income communities of color and that people experiencing poverty lack financial resources to relocate from polluted areas. Biden to push for 'generational investments in human infrastructure' in speech in Illinois Read MoreThe EPA plans to direct funding to air quality-monitoring agencies to watch for particles that have been linked to harmful illness in these communities.\"These resources will go to air quality monitoring in communities that need it the most,\" Regan said, \"so that we can ensure as an agency that we are adequately protecting all communities.\"The American Lung Association's \"State of the Air\"' report shows more than 135 million people in the US live in counties with unhealthy levels of ozone or particle pollution, which can lead to asthma issues and even lung cancer in extreme cases. People of color are most affected by poor air quality, the report found, and are 61% more likely than White people to live in a county with a failing grade for at least one pollutant. They are also three times more likely to live in a county that failed all three air quality grades measured in the report (ozone pollution, \"short term\" particle pollution and \"year round\" particle pollution).Air pollution has also taken on added significance amid the Covid-19 pandemic, as research from Harvard suggests a link between higher levels of long-term air pollution and increased death rates from Covid-19.\"Our communities of color and low-income communities have been disproportionately impacted for generations and COVID-19 exacerbated the health disparities that we have seen or been seen in these communities,\" Regan explained. \"If we can properly monitor the air quality in these communities, we begin to alleviate many of the stressors that put these communities at an uncompetitive advantage when the pandemic first hit.\"As part of the American Rescue Plan, Congress allocated $100 million to the EPA for projects targeting health disparities from pollution and Covid. Last month the agency unveiled the $50 million that would be used in various ways to help identify underserved communities and address \"disproportionate environmental or public health harms and risks\" in these neighborhoods through a series of initiatives, including education and training.Biden signs bill repealing Trump-era EPA rule on methane emissionsIn its announcement Wednesday, EPA said it will launch a grant competition calling for proposals on the monitoring of pollutants that are found in communities with health outcome disparities. The competition, which is planned for later this year, is aimed at strengthening communities' abilities to monitor their own air quality, as well as facilitating collaboration between those communities and state, local and Tribal partners, the agency says.Although he did not give a timeline for when the funds would be disbursed, Regan stressed the urgency and said the agency is putting the framework in place to get the resources out as quickly as possible. The EPA administrator also said the agency would be relying on experts in its environmental justice office as well as relying on existing partnerships with community organizations to ensure that the money goes to the communities that need it the most.\"We're laser-focused on how we can get these precious resources to those who need it the most,\" Regan said. \"And I'm confident that we have the staff expertise, we have the existing relationships, and we're going to leverage our state and tribal partnerships to get the job done.\"The issue of air quality is also personal for Regan, who struggled with asthma during his childhood in eastern North Carolina.\"I'm one of those children who grew up using an inhaler. I understand what it's like when you can't get that breath,\" he said at a CNN town hall earlier this year.",

Boric will be sworn in as President on March 11.Earlier Sunday, Kast conceded the election to Boric and congratulated his opponent \"on his great triumph.\"\"From today he is the elected President of Chile and deserves all our respect and constructive collaboration. Chile is always first,\" Kast tweeted.Speaking to supporters at his campaign headquarters Sunday night, President-elect Boric thanked the people of Chile.Read More\"I want to begin this historical moment which is tremendously exciting, and that the eyes of Chile and the world are watching, thanking all Chileans who went to vote, honoring their commitment to democracy,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter if you did it for me or my opponent; the important thing is that you did it, you were present, you showed your commitment to this country that belongs to each of you.\"Outgoing Chilean President Sebastian Pinera congratulated Boric earlier in the evening, saying, \"Chileans have given an example of democracy, you were part of that, I congratulate you.\" Video from CNN Chile showed celebrations in the capital, Santiago, on Sunday evening, with people waving banners and flags in support of Boric. Polar oppositesRepresenting polar opposites of Chile's presidential race, Boric and Kast emerged as the two leading candidates after a general election was held on November 21. Kast garnered 28% of that vote, missing the necessary 50% needed to avoid a runoff. Boric came in second with 25%.Kast, whose recent surge in popularity has surprised critics, has sometimes been compared to former US President Donald Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro -- he is a staunch defender of former dictator General Augusto Pinochet's regime and the free market. The 55-year-old former congressman's agenda included a tax cut for companies, building barriers in the north of Chile to prevent migrants from entering illegally and abolishing abortion.Boric meanwhile, was a student leader in the Chilean capital rallying against the country's privatized education system alongside thousands of others, 10 years ago.Chilean presidential candidate Jose Antonio Kast of the Republican Party speaks to supporters during the presidential elections campaign closing rally on November 18 in Santiago, Chile. This election comes two years after massive protests and riots shook the country in October 2019, with protesters demanding improved pensions, better education, and the end of an economic system they said favors the elite.The unrest led to now-outgoing President Pinera to agree to a referendum to change the constitution, which was inherited from Pinochet's bloody dictatorship. Last year, Chileans overwhelmingly voted to draft a new one. That process is in now in the works, with the new constitution to be voted on in a plebiscite sometime in mid-2022.Boric's political platform has been riding on that wave, which includes proposals for a more inclusive public health system, to cancel student debt, to raise taxes for the super wealthy and a revision of the state's private pension system -- which was inherited from Pinochet's military regime.From student protester to leftist hero: Meet the shaggy-haired millennial vying for Chile's presidencyBut Chile still hasn't regained the stability for which it was once known. It has been hard-hit economically by the pandemic, and brutal clashes between protesters and security forces continue weekly in Santiago.Considering the recent past, Boric was widely perceived as the presidential candidate who better represented the country's social movement. He is a supporter of abortion rights, a welfare state model, and leads a broad coalition that includes Chile's Communist Party.Speaking after his victory Sunday, Boric thanked the women of Chile who \"organized themselves throughout the nation to defend the rights that have cost them so much to achieve, from things as basic as the right to vote that some dared to question to the right to decide over their own body.\"\"I want to tell you, count on us, you will be protagonists of our government,\" he added, telling the country he will be the \"President of all Chileans.\"Analyst Robert Funk, professor at the University of Chile, said Boric has had \"an amazing, meteoric political career,\" in rising from student leader to President-elect.\"It's a very clear mandate from Chilean voters,\" Funk said. \"His party, his message, really shows the desire -- and the fact that Chilean's voted for that -- shows a desire for change for a more modern Chile.\"Reactions to Boric's victoryLeaders across Latin America and the Caribbean congratulated the new President-elect.Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez tweeted, \"Warm congratulations to @gabrielboric for his election as President of Chile in a historic popular victory. We ratify the will to expand bilateral relations and cooperation between both peoples and governments.\"Colombian President Ivan Duque also tweeted congratulations, saying, \"We express our interest in continuing to work together to strengthen the historic and fraternal bilateral relationship that unites us.

        "content": "(CNN)More than 12 million deaths all over the world are associated with environmental risk factors every year, said Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Assistant Director Jarbas Barbosa.At PAHO's weekly press briefing on Wednesday, Barbosa highlighted how environment and health are intertwined, ahead of the UN climate summit, COP26. The UN Environment Programme reported this week that while countries have promised to cut greenhouse gas emissions, there's still a huge gap between those promises and what's needed to avoid the worse consequences of the climate crisis.\"The health of our planet and the health of our people are interlinked,\" Barbosa said, adding that high temperatures and air pollution have led to a rise in cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.The world promised to cut greenhouse gas emissions. These countries aren't meeting their targets.The PAHO official also said wildfires and droughts have led to crop failure impacting the livelihoods of the agricultural workforce and increased food insecurity in the Americas.Global leaders will focus on solutions to the climate crisis at COP26 after a summer packed with deadly extreme weather. In addition to wildfires and drought in South America, the US has been battered by drought-fueled wildfires, flooding and hurricanes. China and Germany experienced deadly flooding and Southern Europe battled wildfires of its own.Read More\"Extreme weather and rising temperatures have changed our ecosystems and displaced people from their homes, often forcing humans to infringe on natural habitats and animals to move to more hospitable conditions,\" Barbosa said, adding that this has led to an increase in diseases like Zika and Chagas.\"And dengue, which typically follows a seasonal pattern, is being detected outside of its normal cycle as temperatures have warmed and as wet seasons have prolonged,\" he said.Earlier this month, the World Health Organization called for governments and policymakers to \"act with urgency\" on the climate and health crises. The report described climate change as the \"single biggest health threat facing humanity,\" and outlined 10 recommended climate and health actions.That report followed the agency's new air quality guidelines, released in September, which it said could prevent millions of deaths globally each year. Fine particulate matter, or PM 2.5, is the tiniest pollutant yet also among the most dangerous. When inhaled, it travels deep into lung tissue where it can enter the bloodstream and can contribute to asthma, cardiovascular disease and other respiratory illnesses.Climate crisis is 'single biggest health threat facing humanity,' WHO says, calling on world leaders to actThose guidelines also support recent research that found air pollution is most likely a contributing factor to health burden caused by Covid-19.Barbosa gave an overview of Covid-19 in the Americas saying over the last week the region reported 800,000 new Covid-19 infections and 18,000 deaths -- the lowest figures in over a year.\"We have reason to be optimistic, but we must remain vigilant,\" he said.Belize is reporting a sharp increase in Covid-19-related deaths, and Paraguay's Covid-19 cases doubled in the last week, according to Barbosa. In the Caribbean, larger islands like Cuba are seeing a downward trend but smaller islands like Saint Kitts and Nevis, Barbados, Anguilla and Saint Vincent and the Grenadine are just now reaching their first pandemic peaks, he said.Today, he said, nearly 44% of people in Latin America and the Caribbean are fully vaccinated -- but in Guatemala, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Jamaica, Nicaragua, and Haiti -- less than 20% of people have been fully vaccinated, Barbosa said.CNN's Rachel Ramirez and Jacqueline Howard contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Thousands marched for abortion rights across Latin America on Tuesday, holding placards and banners that read \"It is my right to decide\" and \"legal abortion for health and life,\" as they demanded reproductive freedoms in a region known for some of the world's strictest anti-abortion laws. Several Latin American nations still ban abortion, including El Salvador, which has sentenced some women to up to 40 years in prison. In a number of high-profile cases, women have been convicted and imprisoned after suffering miscarriages and stillbirths.The rallies, held on International Safe Abortion Day, were aimed at pressuring lawmakers to ease punitive abortion laws, with demonstrators taking to the streets in countries including El Salvador, Chile and Mexico.In El Salvador -- where abortions are illegal even when the pregnancy poses a risk to the mother, and in cases of rape and incest -- protesters held signs calling for safe and free legal abortions as they made their way to Congress. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has ruled out any reform to abortion laws as part of the controversial constitutional changes planned by his government. Read MoreBut Morena Herrera, a prominent Salvadoran feminist, said that such a move did not require constitutional reform, according to Reuters.\"We are asking for minimum measures to add to the Penal Code to guarantee the life and integrity of women,\" she said.Women place placards on the fence during Tuesday's protest in El Salvador.Reform is happening Changes to some abortion laws are happening in the largely Roman Catholic region. Last year, Argentina voted to legalize abortion at up to 14 weeks into pregnancy, after previously imposing prison sentences of up to 15 years except in cases of rape or danger to the mother's health.On Tuesday, Chilean lawmakers were one step closer to easing the country's tight restrictions after the lower Chamber of Deputies approved a plan to debate a bill expanding abortion access, according to an official press release.The bill proposes decriminalizing abortion in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy -- a major step for one of the region's most conservative countries.Chile's strict abortion laws forbid abortion unless the pregnancy results from rape, if the fetus has a deadly congenital disability, or if a woman's life is at risk.The bill now has to be debated by the legislature's Commission for Women and Gender Equity before receiving final approval by the Chamber of Deputies and passing to the country's Senate to be voted into law.Mexico's abortion ruling could make waves beyond its bordersThe Chilean legislative moves follow a landmark ruling earlier this month from Mexico's Supreme Court, which declared that penalizing abortions was unconstitutional. That decision paves the way for legalizing abortion throughout Mexico.On Tuesday, an abortion rally in Mexico City saw clashes between protesters and police officers, injuring 37 people, according to the city government. The rally, which demanded reproductive rights and was organized by feminist groups, started in the afternoon from two different points and marched to the capital's main square. The protest was guarded by the city's policewomen.    Mexican authorities placed protective fences around key buildings and monuments ahead of the march. The clashes took place when some protesters vandalized some structures. Among the injured were nine civilians, a public servant and 27 female members of the police force.",

        "content": "(CNN)More than year into the global pandemic, Brazil's government has decided to form a new Covid-19 crisis committee that will now include state officials.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro made the announcement on Wednesday, a day after he promised the nation that 2021 would be \"the year of vaccination\" for Brazilians.Brazil is currently gripped by a devastating new surge in cases, with a record-breaking 3,251 new deaths from Covid-19 on Tuesday -- the most deaths the country has ever seen in a single day. Hospitals' intensive care units across the country are overstretched, and some states have warned they're running out of medicines necessary to intubate severe cases.Bolsonaro, who was fiercely criticized for downplaying the gravity of the panemic, has hinted at a potential shift in attitude. On Tuesday, hours after his newly appointed health minister Marcelo Queiroga was sworn in, Bolsonaro emphasized in a public address that \"mass vaccination\" would be a priority -- after previously dismissing the urgency of inoculation and even attacking some vaccines.Following a year of often acrimonious relations and blame between federal and local governments, the new committee will include members of the legislative branch, the Supreme Court, ministers, and six state governors. The federal government did not respond to questions about whether the new committee would replace a similar group composed only of federal-level officials.Read MoreExclusive: Former Brazilian leader Lula urges Biden to call an emergency coronavirus summitStill, not everyone gets a say. State governors who've been political opponents of Bolsonaro, like Sao Paulo governor Joao Doria, have been left out of the committee. On Thursday, Brazil's national association of mayors also wrote a letter to President Jair Bolsonaro asking to be included.The new committee will meet every week to decide the next steps in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic, the President said on Wednesday.States are running low on suppliesBolsonaro, an outspoken opponent of restrictions on economic activity, has repeatedly clashed with state authorities on how to manage Covid-19 outbreaks.This week, the country's Supreme Court struck down the President's request to block three state governors from imposing restrictive lockdown measures in their states.No vaccines, no leadership, no end in sight. How Brazil became a global threatSupreme Court Justice, Marco Aur\u00e9lio Mello underlined the autonomy governors and mayors have to manage the health crises in their jurisdictions, saying Tuesday that a \"totalitarian vision\" is not appropriate in a democracy like Brazil and that the president is responsible for \"the larger leadership, the coordination of efforts aimed at the well-being of Brazilians.\"Meanwhile, public and private health systems in states across the country are straining to accommodate rising Covid-19 case numbers.On Thursday, the Brazilian Association of Private Hospitals in Brazil warned that stocks of anesthetics used in Covid-19 treatment would only last for \"three to four days\" in private hospitals. Earlier in the week, a statement posted on the Brazilian Attorney General's website said that six states in Brazil were running critically low on medical oxygen. General Ridauto Fernandes, logistics director of the Ministry of Health, has said that negotiations are underway to increase the production of oxygen supplies and to install oxygen concentrators -- equipment that draws and concetrates oxygen from the air -- in different parts of the country.Brazilian variant becomes growing problemMany recent cases have been attributed to the P.1 variant of the coronavirus, first identified in Brazil's own Amazonas state. A March 4 study from Brazil's Oswaldo Cruz Foundation -- also known as the Fiocruz institute -- estimated that coronavirus variants make up more than half of all cases in six out of eight states it studied.According to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the same variant has now been identified in 15 countries and territories in South America, North America and the Caribbean.In a press conference Tuesday, PAHO Director Carissa Etienne highlighted the dangerous potential spread of the virus from Brazil. \"Unfortunately, the dire situation in Brazil is also effecting neighboring countries. Cases have risen in Venezuela, particularly in the states of Bolivar and Amazonas which border Brazil,\" she said.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Sunday called Brazil a \"global threat,\" citing the P.1 variant.In Uruguay, where cases are also spiking, health officials said this week that they also had detected the P.1 variant.Marcia Reverdosa in Sao Paulo, Natalie Gallon and Karol Suarez in Mexico City, Caitlin Hu in New York City, Claudia Rebaza in London, Dario Klein in Montevideo and Abel Alvarado in Atlanta contributed to this report.",
