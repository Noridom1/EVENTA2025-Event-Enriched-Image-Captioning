        "content": "(CNN)US officials warned that a wave of debilitating cyberattacks could accompany Russia's war on Ukraine. So far they haven't materialized, and US and Ukrainian officials are contemplating why as they prepare for the next phase of the war. There have been several hacks of Ukrainian organizations, but no reports yet of the sort of high-impact cyberattacks on transportation or electric infrastructure that some feared. The possible explanations for this, analysts say, range from disorganization in Russian military planning to hardened Ukrainian defenses, to the fact that bombs and bullets take precedence over hacking in wartime.  The reason Russia has so far not flexed in cyberspace during the war may be unattainable \u2014 or require being inside the minds of Russian spy chiefs. But how US, European and Ukrainian officials perceive the situation shapes how they allocate resources to defend Ukrainian computer networks as the war continues.\"What we have seen to date from Russia's state cyber actors appears to reflect the same challenges seen in their conventional forces,\" said a US cyber defense official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. \"It is likely that inadequate preparation and bad assumptions have resulted in a haphazard performance that underplays their known capabilities.\"Read MoreLimited Russian cyberattacksCyberattacks have played a supporting, not a central, role in the war and hacking incidents preceded and accompanied Russia's bombardment of Ukraine: \u2022 February 15: Cyberattacks temporarily knocked the websites of Ukrainian agencies and big banks offline. The White House blamed Russia for the incident (the Kremlin denied involvement).\u2022 February 23: Hours before Russian airstrikes began hitting Ukraine, a cyberattack deleted data at multiple Ukrainian government agencies and private companies. \u2022 February 25: Ukrainian government officials accused hackers working for the Belarusian Ministry of Defense of trying to break into the private email accounts of Ukrainian military personnel. \u2022 March 10: Unidentified hackers caused disruptions at Ukrainian internet service provider Triolan, which has customers in big Ukrainian cities. Triolan blamed \"the enemy\" (a reference to Russia) for the incident but did not provide evidence to support the allegation.Gen. Paul Nakasone, the most senior military cyber official in the US government, offered a vague, multi-faceted explanation for the relatively muted Russian cyber activity to lawmakers this week. Defensive work by Ukrainians, \"some of the challenges that the Russians have encountered, and some of the work that others have been able to prevent their actions\" explained the situation, said Nakasone, who heads the National Security Agency and US Cyber Command. \"They bomb critical infrastructure, So they don't need to hack it'Ukrainian computer defenses have indeed improved since 2015 and 2016, when cyberattacks cut power in parts of Ukraine, and 2017, when devastating malicious software known as NotPetya emerged in the country and spread to organizations around the world, costing billions of dollars in damage. (The Justice Department blamed Russia's GRU military intelligence directorate for all three attacks; the Kremlin denied involvement.)But many analysts say that heightened Ukrainian cyber defenses cannot be the sole reason for the lack of visible Russian cyber operations. And US officials are predisposed to crediting Ukrainian network defenses in which Washington has invested millions of dollars, and countless hours on the ground in recent years, in building them up. Yegor Aushev, a Ukrainian cybersecurity executive who helped organize an ad hoc group of hackers to target Russian organizations during the war, offered a simpler explanation. \"The first phase of the war was a hybrid war,\" Aushev said by phone from Ukraine this week. US officials eye Russian reliance on unsophisticated but brutal heavy weaponry in UkraineThe Russians, he said, used cyberattacks because there is plausible deniability in doing so. But the second phase of the war has been out in the open. \"They bomb critical infrastructure,\" Aushev said. \"So they don't need to hack it, in hidden mode.\"John Hultquist, vice president of intelligence analysis at cybersecurity firm Mandiant, echoed that point.\"Cyberattacks are often reversible and they are often carried out for their psychological effects,\" Hultquist, a US Army veteran, told CNN. \"And in a situation when the Russians are already shelling cities, those effects are going to be fairly limited.\"The so-called Ukraine \"IT army\" that Aushev is working with claims thousands of volunteer hackers from Ukraine and abroad. The Ukrainian government is actively encouraging these cyberattacks on Russian organizations \u2014 and claiming that these hacks are disrupting Russian cyber activities aimed at Ukraine. \"As it turns out, [Russian computer] systems are not that secure,\" boasted Serhiy Demedyuk, deputy secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council. \"They employed their potential to carry out destructive attacks on other states, but failed to secure their own resources.\"The extent to which pro-Ukraine hacking against Russian organizations has been successful is difficult to assess. There have been disruptions to Russian state media websites that parrot the Kremlin's propaganda about the war.  The longer gameAnother possibility is that the fog of war has obscured some Russian cyber activity.  We might not hear about it for months if some of the elite hacking teams associated with Russian intelligence services have engaged in significant activity in Ukraine, Hultquist said. \"It's a perfect environment for chaos to hide in,\" Hultquist told CNN. All the more so if bombs destroy digital evidence of a hack. The Ukrainian government has made plans to move some of its computer infrastructure out of Kyiv as Russian troops continue to pound the city. Preserving those digital records could be key to learning more about any additional Russian cyber activity during the war. With the war grinding on, US and European officials are also wary of any spillover from a Russian hack in Ukraine that could hobble agencies or corporations in NATO countries. How the US is trying to help Ukraine without triggering a wider war with RussiaThe data-wiping hack on the eve of Russia's invasion was precisely targeted, but did infect two Ukrainian government contractors with a presence in Latvia and Lithuania, which are NATO members. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said a cyberattack could trigger NATO's collective defense clause, requiring all members to defend an attack on another member. But that has never happened and it is unclear what NATO's threshold in cyberspace is.Erica Lonergan, associate research scholar at Columbia University's Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies, said it would make sense for Russia to retaliate against Western government sanctions in cyberspace in a way that doesn't escalate conventional conflict with NATO.\"Precisely for the reasons that cyber isn't necessarily useful in the battlefield, it is a way that states engage in subversion, create information advantage and cause disruption,\" Lonergan told CNN.",

        "content": "(CNN)There are many details we still don't know about WNBA star Brittney Griner's arrest in Russia. But there's a lot we can learn from the experiences of Americans who were detained there in the past. The country's strict drug laws also offer some indication of what could be next for Griner, experts say.Some experts who spoke with CNN were quick to tie Griner's arrest to the bigger geopolitical picture, and warned she's likely to be used as a bargaining chip in the days to come. Others say it's premature to draw any connection between the drug charges Griner's facing and tensions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Here's what experts say are some key things to keep in mind: Drug laws in Russia are strictRead MoreRussia's federal customs agency says a criminal case is underway, and state media reports say Griner is accused of drug smuggling after cannabis oil was allegedly found in her suitcase at a Moscow airport. Those are serious accusations, given how strict Russia's drug laws are, says William E. Butler, a professor at Penn State Dickinson Law.\"Russia has, and has had for many decades, a zero tolerance attitude towards narcotic substances, so it's a serious offense,\" he says.The crime Griner is accused of carries a possible punishment of 5-10 years in prison, Butler says, in addition to the possible imposition of a fine.Brittney Griner of the Phoenix Mercury has been detained in Russia for weeks.False accusations are a possibilityBut it's also important to consider another possibility, says Peter Maggs, a law professor at the University of Illinois and an expert on Russia's civil code. \"There have been a lot of allegations of planting of substances on people, particularly on the part of human rights advocates,\" he says.And a February State Department warning urged Americans to avoid travel to Russia, noting the risk of arrest.\"Russian security services have arrested U.S. citizens on spurious charges, denied them fair and transparent treatment, and have convicted them in secret trials and/or without presenting credible evidence,\" the warning said.Prison conditions have come under fireAuthorities haven't said where Griner is being held, and her family has been tight-lipped about the details of the case. But her arrest has brought renewed attention to two other Americans detained in Russia -- Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed.Both men and their families have denied the charges against them and criticized their treatment while in custody. Whelan, a former US Marine, was detained at a Moscow hotel in 2018 and arrested on espionage charges, which he has consistently denied. He was convicted and sentenced in June 2020 to 16 years in prison in a trial widely denounced as unfair by US officials. In a call with CNN in June, Whelan described the grim conditions of the remote labor camp where he spends his days working in a clothing factory that he called a \"sweatshop,\" and said, \"Getting medical care here is very difficult.\"Reed, a former US Marine detained in Russia since 2019, was sentenced to nine years in prison in July 2020 for endangering the \"life and health\" of Russian police officers after a night of drinking, according to state-run news agency TASS. US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan called the trial \"theater of the absurd\" after Reed's 2020 sentencing.Trevor Reed stands inside a defendants' cage during a 2020 court hearing in Moscow.In recent calls to his parents from the Russian prison where he's being held, Reed said he had been coughing up blood, had intermittent fevers and had pain in his chest, according to his father -- and the family is concerned he has tuberculosis. In a statement Thursday, Reed's parents said they were concerned he will be sent to solitary confinement rather than to medical care.\"It's hard to explain how panicked we are after hearing his voice today,\" his parents said.CNN has reached out to the Russian Federal Penitentiary Service for comment. Nick Daniloff, an American journalist who was detained in the USSR in 1986, told CNN he has questions about where Griner is being held.\"The Russians seized her and she's incommunicado. ... It's very possible that she's being held in the sort of a prison where I was taken -- an isolation prison,\" Daniloff says.Daniloff, who was imprisoned for weeks in isolated conditions while officials negotiated his release, says he believes his roommate in prison was tasked with informing authorities about his behavior -- and Griner could find herself in a similar situation.US reporter Nicholas Daniloff holds up a T-shirt after his release from being detained in Russia in 1986.Griner\u00a0should\u00a0have access to a lawyer and consular representativesRussian law guarantees Griner access to counsel and consular representatives, Butler says.\"She's under what I understand to be investigative detention. ... She will have had the right to counsel. She will have had the right to contact the embassy, the American consulate, she will have had the right to be visited,\" he says.But a US lawmaker told CNN Thursday that consular officials haven't been able to meet with Griner.\"The embassy has requested consular access to her ... and that has been denied now for three weeks. She has been in touch with her Russian lawyer, and her Russian lawyer has been in touch with her agent and her family back home. So, we do know that she's OK,\" US Rep. Colin Allred, a Texas Democrat, told CNN's \"Don Lemon Tonight.\" \"We just know that she's been held now for three weeks without official government access to her, which really is unusual and extremely concerning,\" Allred said.CNN has reached out to Russian officials regarding Griner's consular access but has not heard back.The State Department has declined to provide details on the case, citing privacy considerations.\"We are aware of and closely engaged on this case,\" a State Department spokesperson said in a statement Thursday.The war 'makes everything more complex' This much is clear: the timing is terrible. In the days since Griner's February detention, Russia has invaded Ukraine, and tensions between Russia and the United States have intensified.\"It's hard to imagine a more difficult negotiating environment than this,\" says Philip Mudd, a CNN counterterrorism analyst who used to work for the CIA. \"We have the difficulty of diplomatic negotiations with the Russians, whom we don't trust, obviously, overlaid with the fact that we're involved in the war and the Russians don't trust us. I don't see how it could be more difficult than this right now.\"The war in Ukraine \"makes everything more complex\" and will make Russian authorities even more inclined to manipulate the situation, says Nikolay Marinov, a political science professor at the University of Houston. \"They will be less forthcoming, and they will be less cooperative, and it may be a while before they give more official information,\" he says.A trial could be swift, but appeals could be lengthyAuthorities haven't said when, or if, a trial could be held in Griner's case. Legal experts told CNN a trial could happen quickly, but appeals can be lengthy. \"Usually, where the facts are relatively simple, one would expect things to move very quickly. They've got the witnesses of the airport experts, they've got the physical evidence, they've got the lab report,\" Maggs says. \"That shouldn't take a lot of time. But then appeals can take all sorts of time.\"US citizen Paul Whelan attends a 1020 sentencing hearing at the Moscow City Court.He points to the recent case of US businessman Michael Calvey, which concluded more than two years after he was first detained. Calvey was convicted of embezzlement -- an accusation he denied.There may be an 'off ramp'Despite the serious charges Griner faces, there could still be an \"off ramp,\" Butler says: Authorities could decide to charge Griner with possession rather than smuggling.\"If they were to decide that she made a mistake, she went through the green line instead of the red line (at the airport), she failed to declare it, they could treat that as an administrative offense instead of a criminal offense,\" he says. \"If they did that, they wouldn't charge her with smuggling, they would charge her with ... possession. If that were the case, she would be subjected to a fine and probably deportation.\"Griner, a two-time Olympic basketball gold medalist and WNBA star, plays for the Russian club UMMC Ekaterinburg during the WNBA offseason.But Butler stresses there's a lot we still don't know about Griner's case.\"It's very hard to judge from the outside. ... In this case we really know astonishingly little of the actual facts and what's happened ever since the detention occurred,\" Butler says.A prisoner swap may be possibleAt points in the past, when Americans have been detained in Russia and other countries, their release has been negotiated as part of a prisoner swap.\"In my case, the FBI had arrested a Soviet in New York for espionage, and the Russians then arrested me. I was coming to the end of my assignment in Moscow (working for US News and World Report), and ... a negotiation eventually took place involving my being released, involving a solution for the guy who was arrested in New York, and there were some other elements that came into play as well,\" Daniloff recalls.At the time, Daniloff credited President Reagan for pushing for his release.\"This was a very complex situation, and if it hadn't been for President Reagan's taking a very deep and personal interest in my case, it would probably be some years before I could stand in front of you and say, 'Thank you, Mr. President,'\" Daniloff said at a news conference beside Reagan after his release in 1986.US reporter Nicholas Daniloff stands with President Ronald Reagan after his release from being detained in Russia.Could a similar deal be made for Reed, Whelan and Griner?\"The question is whether we have enough to trade for three Americans. But a deal's a deal, and Putin is going to be ready to make a deal,\" Mudd says. \"If we do have Russians that he wants, I don't see why it's worth avoiding a negotiation just because we're at war.\"Marinov says Griner's case is just one small piece in the big geopolitical picture. But there's no doubt, he says, that Russian officials are contemplating how to use it to their advantage.\"I'm sure they have 10 plans at the moment of how they can exploit this, and what kind of a spin they can put on it -- what maximum advantage they can  gain,\" he says.Cases like Griner's have been resolved through negotiation in the past, he says. But how long that could take in this case, he says, is yet another unanswered question.CNN's Rosa Flores, Brian Todd, Lucy Kafanov, Holly Yan, Travis Caldwell and Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report.",

And an independent autopsy found the 46-year-old died during the 2020 encounter of \"asphyxiation from sustained pressure\" when his neck and back were compressed. That same year, Elijah McClain was diagnosed with \"excited delirium\" by paramedics in Aurora, Colorado. McClain was placed in a carotid hold by police and injected with ketamine when paramedics arrived. The medics never checked the 23-year-old Black man's vital signs, talked to him or touched him before making the diagnosis, a Colorado grand jury found. McClain was declared brain dead three days later.Two strangers, with the same first name, and a terrifying story about ketamine in policingAnd \"excited delirium\" was among the causes of death listed for Daniel Prude in Rochester, New York, along with complications of asphyxia in a setting of physical restraint and acute PCP intoxication, according to a medical examiner's report. The 41-year-old Black man was having a mental health emergency in 2020 when officers covered his head with a mesh hood and held him prone on the ground before he stopped breathing. He was declared brain dead and died a week later.Excited delirium is used as a field diagnosis by first responders across the country. Officers in many police departments are officially taught to look for \"superhuman strength\" and \"police non-compliance\" as symptoms of a syndrome that could kill the subject of an emergency call or induce that person to kill them.Read More\"Pain tolerance,\" \"unusual strength,\" \"agitation\" and being \"inappropriately clothed\" are other potential features of the syndrome listed in an American College of Emergency Physicians white paper cited in expert testimony in Chauvin's trial, though the doctors' group told CNN it never officially endorsed the 2009 document.Similar descriptions of excited delirium can be found in police training materials used in several major US cities. Officers are called upon to make split-second decisions to identify the condition in order to preserve their own safety and the safety of their subject, including potentially by using force. Such a determination also later can be key to how the public, their supervisors or the courts view the incident.Bans on chokeholds for federal officers latest in nationwide push to hold police to a 'higher standard' Authorities claimed these Black men had excited delirium just before they died. But the diagnosis itself is a problem and should be abandoned, a new study says. But a new study from doctors at Harvard, the University of Michigan and Massachusetts General Hospital, as well as civil rights lawyers, says the term excited delirium is \"scientifically meaningless\" and has become a \"catch-all for deaths occurring in the context of law enforcement restraint, often coinciding with substance use or mental illness, and disproportionately used to explain the deaths of young Black men in police encounters.\" Indeed, a case that helped cement the term's widespread use unfairly targeted Black people. And while there is no national database of excited delirium deaths in police custody, one study of 166 cases found that Black people made up 43% of those deaths from 2010 to 2020 nationally. Black or African Americans made up 13% of the population in the most recent US Census. In rejecting the term outright, the coalition of physicians, civil rights attorneys and researchers who worked on the Physicians for Human Rights study wants it stricken from the official vocabulary used by emergency medicine technicians, doctors, law enforcement and medical examiners. It should be replaced, they say, with an approach that prioritizes immediate treatment of the underlying causes of the behavior encountered by first responders. A better approach might also mean expanding the type of professional who responds to emergency calls to include those with specialized training in mental health and social work.  Medical groups don't recognize police termThe problem with \"excited delirium\" goes deeper than the phrase itself, said Dr. Michele Heisler, medical director of Physicians for Human Rights, a co-author of the study and a professor of public health and internal medicine at the University of Michigan. \"We were concerned about the concept,\" she explained, pointing to the myriad of symptoms often listed under the term's umbrella. \"People can become agitated or delirious due to multiple factors, ranging from alcohol withdrawal, drug overdose, psychosis. ... What we're arguing is that these underlying causes require medical attention, rather than forcible restraint by police.\" Officers learn in academy training to restrain and control a subject until medics -- who are supposed to make any medical diagnosis -- get to the scene.  \"Training typically involves recognizing signs of ED (excited delirium) and summoning emergency medical services immediately in such cases,\" Sherri Martin, national director of wellness services for the Fraternal Order of Police told CNN. FBI may have to shut down federal use-of-force database due to low participation from law enforcementPolice also sometimes lean heavily on paramedics to use powerful tranquilizer drugs so subjects experiencing what they say is excited delirium stop resisting. Later on, coroners and medical examiners may use the same language, including as part of autopsies. An umbrella term like excited delirium can also help facilitate the training process, Sergeant Tony Lockhart, crisis intervention trainer for King's County, Washington, said. \"You call it whatever you want; I see these behaviors.\" Aggregating them into one idea, he said, is \"helpful in some areas, to at least give us a different title to think about in our head.\" Even so, the term is not listed in the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases nor the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, tools seen as the standard for medical diagnosis across the world. The American Medical Association does not support it as a diagnosis, and the American Psychiatric Association, which does not recognize it as a mental disorder, referred to it in 2020 as \"too non-specific\" and its criteria unclear, adding that no rigorous studies had been done to validate it. The term's roots also raise questions. Excited delirium was first used in the 1980s, when a deputy chief medical examiner in Florida publicized a theory that Black women could die from \"combining sex with cocaine use,\" the Physicians for Human Rights study details. \"For some reason, the male of the species becomes psychotic and the female of the species dies in relation to sex,\" Dr. Charles Wetli of Miami-Dade County told the Miami Herald at the time, adding that it might be the genetic makeup of Black people that predisposes them to dying. The modern incarnation of the term, the report says, was popularized by the 2005 mass-purchase and distribution of one book to police departments by the makers of TASER guns, Axon Network. The company distributed those copies to bring awareness to excited delirium, it told CNN in a statement. What delirium looks like\"Superhuman strength,\" one of the criteria to identify excited delirium listed in the 2009 ACEP report, is completely unfounded, Heisler said. Instead, \"if you're frightened, it's going to be an intense adrenergic response,\" she said. \"You're going to have a strong fight-or-flight response. (But) it's not a response that in and of itself is going to cause death.\" Adrenaline-related responses are responsible for an increase in heart rate, constriction of blood vessels and dilation of pupils, she said. But it's unfounded \"that you can just suddenly scare yourself to death -- which in a way seems to be the implied physiological mechanism of excited delirium. But it certainly is the case that it's very frightening,\" Heisler said.In their report, the Physicians for Human Rights authors used the American Psychiatric Association's definition of delirium: \"a neurocognitive disorder characterized by a 'disturbance in attention and awareness that develops over a short period of time and is not better explained by another preexisting, evolving, or established disorder.'\"In layman's terms: \"Delirium is a symptom of an underlying cause and not an independent diagnosis,\" Heisler said. A person with delirium may show \"fear, agitation, or euphoria, as well as reduced awareness of the environment,\" and delirium itself is usually a sign of an underlying problem, such as organ failure, infection, lack of oxygen, low blood sugar levels, drug side effects, intoxication or withdrawal, according to the Physicians for Human Rights report.  In any case, \"delirium ... wouldn't be defined just by the need for use of force,\" said Dr. Debra Pinals, director of the American Psychiatric Association's Council on Psychiatry and Law. A photograph of Elijah McClain is part of the \"Say Their Names\" memorial, in part honoring Black people who died in police custody across the US, in 2020 in Boston.The report also raises concern over the use of the term in medical examiners' and coroners' reports as a cause of death. \"Delirium is not itself considered a cause of sudden death,\" it reads. \"You can't say that someone dies from any form of delirium,\" Heisler said. \"It's like saying, what is the cause of death? Chest pain. What is the cause of death? I don't know, shortness of breath. In a way, it's as nonsensical.\" The National Association of Medical Examiners has never issued \"any type of consensus on excited delirium and as an organization have not formally 'recognized the condition as a diagnosis,'\" it told CNN in a statement. Its president, Dr. Kathryn Pinneri, said, \"I suspect it is accepted among many NAME members.\" Officers often feel caught in the middleIn the field and in medical settings, the treatment for delirium is to address the underlying cause with medical care such as hydration, medication, and pain control, Heisler said. Restraints are actively discouraged, according to the Physicians for Human Rights report, and \"never include prone or neck restraints, and are monitored by an independent medical oversight organization.\"  But Lockhart said in his trainings, he teaches officers to restrain subjects in \"altered states\" -- for their own safety and for the safety of others involved -- as swiftly as possible. \"The longer it goes on, definitely more danger to the subject, definitely more danger to every officer involved and for that matter, any other folks around,\" he said. Grand jury votes not to indict police officers in Rochester death of Daniel Prude Lockhart's view is that there should be as many officers around the subject as possible. \"In an ideal world ... one officer grabs one leg, and another grabs one leg, another grabs an arm and other grabs an arm, obviously giving commands and try to do that quickly as we can to get them detained to get that medical person access to that individual.\"  But in reality, restraining a person in distress can be much more challenging, especially when only one or two officers are on the scene, he said. The exhaustive training police officers go through as cadets on excited delirium -- and continue to attend as mandatory refreshers throughout their careers -- has shown, even in court, to be part of the problem. \"The fact is, that term has been increasingly co-opted by nonmedical professionals and being used in nonclinical discussions or nonclinical realms,\" said Dr. Jeffrey Goodloe, member of the American College of Emergency Physicians board of directors and chief medical officer for the EMS system for Metropolitan Oklahoma City and Tulsa. \"There's quite a spectrum of educational programming, even within the house of medicine between different specialties. And then obviously, that just becomes even more exponentially magnified, if you will, if you look at the various and sundry training programs within EMS agencies, ambulance services, fire departments, law enforcement agencies, and so there's not one national standard educational curriculum in this.\" It's clear more training and dialogue between the law enforcement and the medical communities is needed, Goodloe said. In Lockhart's 40-hour classes on excited delirium, he said he specifically tells officers, \"You are not here to learn how to diagnose. You're looking at these behaviors so that you may alter your techniques to get a good solution so everybody's safe.\" But a disconnect between first responder training -- based on the handful of studies that validate excited delirium -- and most academic medical literature has first responders acting out of step with the medical community. \"Police officers often feel like they're caught in the middle,\" said Martin, of the Fraternal Order of Police. \"They're not thinking about all of these other voices. They show up to work every day to answer the calls, to do their job, and they want to have the tools and the knowledge to do the best job that they can.\" Departments are also concerned with liability, she said, and they have an incentive to ensure officers are acting in accordance with regulations. \"They don't want their department, their officer, their community to suffer the death of someone who was or may be suffering with excited delirium.\"  Pictures of Elijah McClain and George Floyd left by demonstrators line the fence outside a Minnesota police station in April 2021.'Term can produce a visceral and negative response' But changes in how police learn to respond to medical emergencies and mental health crises might not come easy. In Minneapolis, despite a 2021 directive from the city to halt excited delirium training, officers were still being trained on the concept months later, the Star Tribune reported in February. A digital slide from a training program shows the words \"excited delirium\" stricken through and below them, \"severe agitation with delirium,\" is suggested as a better term, a video obtained by the newspaper shows.  During Chauvin's trial in April, Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo testified the then-officer's actions and use of force during Floyd's arrest were contrary to department policy. 3 former Minneapolis police officers found guilty of violating George Floyd's civil rights \"There is an initial reasonableness in trying to just get him under control in the first few seconds,\" Arradondo said. \"But once there was no longer any resistance and clearly when Mr. Floyd was no longer responsive and even motionless, to continue to apply that level of force to a person proned out, handcuffed behind their back -- that in no way shape or form is anything that is by policy. It is not part of our training, and it is certainly not part of our ethics or our values.\" After an outcry over the term excited delirium in 2020, even the American College of Emergency Physicians -- whose definition remains the industry standard -- has tried to shift its language in new studies to \"'hyperactive delirium.\" \"We recognize the term 'excited delirium' is increasingly being used in non-clinical medicine discussions and the term can produce a visceral and negative response, particularly among those in communities with complicated relationships with law enforcement or medicine,\" a spokesperson for the group told CNN in statement. \"In clinical discussions, patient care, and especially safety of patients during care, must remain the focus.\"Officers instead could be taught about an array of medical emergencies that may look like what's long been known as excited delirium but that may warrant different medical responses, \"including heart attacks, drug or substance overdoses or withdrawals, acute psychosis, and oxygen deprivation,\" the Physicians for Human Rights report states. \"I think we're asking too much of police officers, and I think many of them are responding as best they can,\" Heisler said. \"They're being told that you can put your knee on someone's back and that's safe. ... Are we expecting police officers to be trained in all these medical diagnoses? I mean, are we expecting doctors?\" Getting mental health experts to emergency callsThe Physicians for Human Rights report's main recommendation is to nix the use of the term \"excited delirium\" altogether -- erasing it from training manuals and autopsy reports -- and encouraging medical associations that haven't done so to issue statements discouraging its use among their members. Official responses to people experiencing mental and behavioral health challenges must improve, authors say in the report. That might start with rethinking who first responders should be, Heisler said. \"We need to think about -- are there other models? Could we bring in social workers, psychologists, trained behavioral health people, instead of having a group of armed, uniformed police that (are met) with a strong fight-or-flight response?\" she said.  More than a dozen cities push to minimize or even eliminate police presence at mental health callsLockhart, the crisis intervention trainer, agrees with this recommendation and sees major advantages in having team of \"co-responders\" that include police and mental health specialists. \"Just inherently, by that officer being there and listening to the mental health person deal with a subject, that officer is getting better because they're seeing things that work, new ideas, a different way of approaching something,\" he said, adding that an officer's presence helps ensure the safety of the mental health professional.  In the end, he said, the main benefit is that \"the subject we're dealing with is getting better help and hopefully sooner\" than they would otherwise.  On an institutional level, the Physicians for Human Rights study recommends establishing \"independent oversight systems and mandat(ing) independent investigations of deaths in law enforcement custody,\" involving excited delirium in state and local governments, and it calls on Congress to do the same. A report commissioned by Congress could answer many questions the study has identified, said Joanna Naples-Mitchell, human rights lawyer and researcher at Physicians for Human Rights. \"For example, where has excited delirium come up, and trying to understand why it is they are finding what seems to have been the case so far, that it's majority Black men and other people of color this term is being attributed to?\" Naples-Mitchell said. \"And is it exclusively in the context of law enforcement where this term is coming up? Is it exclusively in the context of restraints being used that this comes up and deaths are attributed to excited delirium? There's a lot that legislators can do to really leverage their powers as investigators to look at this and bring public attention to it more broadly.\"",

        "images": [],
        "content": "(CNN)A judge in Texas blocked the state from enforcing Gov. Greg Abbott's order to investigate gender-affirming care of minors as \"child abuse.\"\"The court finds sufficient cause to enter a temporary injunction,\" Judge Amy Clark Meachum in Travis County said Friday evening.The judge said Abbott's order was \"beyond the scope of his authority and unconstitutional\" and that the parents of a transgender child and a psychologist who filed suit against the governor were likely to succeed at trial, which is set for July. Texas confirms 9 investigations of transgender minors receiving gender-affirming health careIn late February, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton declared gender-affirming surgical procedures in children and prescribing drugs that affect puberty to be considered \"child abuse.\" In response to Paxton's legal opinion, the governor directed the Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) \"to conduct a prompt and thorough investigation of any reported instances of these abusive procedures in the State of Texas.\"The state's actions have been widely criticized as an attack on transgender children. Read MoreMeachum ruled in district court last week the state must stop a child abuse investigation of a family seeking gender-affirming health care for their transgender child. That decision came after the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Texas and LGBTQ civil rights organization Lambda Legal filed a lawsuit on behalf of the parents of a transgender girl. The child's mother, a DFPS employee, was suspended from her job because of Paxton's legal opinion. Abbott and Paxton appealed Meachum's decision, but the state's Third Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal over jurisdiction.  The ACLU and Lambda Legal applauded the judge's ruling in a statement Friday. \"We feel relieved and vindicated that the judge understood the magnitude and breadth of the harm that would have resulted if Texas' child welfare agency -- at the direction of the governor -- were allowed to continue enforcing this lawless directive,\" said Paul Castillo, senior counsel at Lambda Legal. Brian Klosterboer, an attorney with ACLU of Texas, said \"trans young deserve to live freely as their true selves.\"\"The court's decisive ruling today brings some needed relief to trans youth in Texas but we cannot stop fighting,\" Klosterboer added.The DFPS employee who is suing spoke off-camera on Friday and was identified only as Jane Doe. Dr. Megan Mooney, the psychologist in the suit, testified the state's order \"goes against medically-necessary research about what gender-affirming care is. It goes against my ethical standards.\"Randa Mulanax, a supervisor in the Child Protective Services department of DFPS, said in court on Friday that department workers were not given discretion over whether to pursue a child abuse investigation under the governor's order, which prompted her to submit her resignation. \"I felt that this was an overreach and placing us in a situation that our department should not be in,\" Mulanax testified, \"meaning private medical decisions between a parent, the child, and doctors.\"Paxton said on Twitter late Friday evening he would appeal the judge's decision. 'Gender affirming care is life-saving care'The ruling came the same day parents and advocates spoke out against such investigations during a meeting of the Texas Family and Protective Services Council in Austin. \"Children will die because of Governor Abbott's order,\" warned the mother of a teenager who, she said, attempted suicide at the age of 12 after coming out as transgender. At the Texas Family and Protective Services Council meeting, dozens of people urged the state to remember its duty to protect all minors, including transgender children. Advocates, including nurses and child care workers, read statements from trans youth and parents who they said were terrified to appear in person. In one statement, a parent asked, \"How can someone not want a child to feel comfortable in their own skin?\"\"We hope to be able to provide them with the tools to make them the best version of themselves without the fear of our child being ripped from a loving home,\" the parent added. The news out of Florida and Texas exemplifies a larger conservative trendAn attorney read a statement from a grandparent of a transgender child who said her son's family will be moving out of Texas because of the governor's directive. \"I'm relieved that both my grandchildren won't have to deal with the stress of the newest way to single them out,\" the grandparent said.Another statement was titled, \"Don't Make Us Write Our Transgender Son's Obituary.\"The family wrote that \"gender affirming care is life-saving care.\"Ricardo Martinez, CEO of the LGBTQ rights group Equality of Texas, said he had a message for youth: \"To trans young people across Texas and the country, you have done absolutely nothing wrong. You are perfect just the way you are. And there are countless people across Texas, across this country, across the world that are fighting to protect your right to exist authentically.\" Rocio Fierro Perez, a political coordinator with the Texas Freedom Network, read a letter from a 13-year-old transgender girl: \"Having support can literally save a child's life and hearing from people in power that your parents are abusing you and you're not real will and has ended the lives of many children.\"Texas has opened nine alleged abuse investigations of minors receiving gender-affirming health care, Patrick Crimmins, a DFPS spokesman, told CNN Thursday.

Jeffers allegedly attacked the victim with a hammer in the 14th Street and 7th Avenue 1, 2, 3 station, causing injuries including a laceration to the victim's head, the complaint outlined. Jeffers also threatened the victim's wife with the hammer, according to the complaint.Read MoreIn an unrelated incident, Jeffers also faces two robbery charges and a petit larceny charge after allegedly stealing ice cream from a drugstore and punching a store employee after he was confronted about the theft, according to the complaint.It's unclear if Jeffers entered a plea to charges in either of the incidents.Jeffers' bail was set at $300,000 on the attempted assault as hate crime complaint and $40,000 on the robbery complaint, according to the DA's office.Jeffers is expected back in court on March 15.Incidents rising in NYC subway systemOn Tuesday at approximately 9:05 p.m., the 29-year-old victim was walking at the 14th Street and 7th Avenue 1, 2, 3 subway station when he bumped into Jeffers, according to police. Jeffers then became \"irate and aggressive\" before hitting the victim in the head with a hammer, the NYPD said.The spokesperson would not say what kind of dispute it was or what was said.Following the attack, emergency medical services was called, and the victim was transported to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition, the spokesperson said.\"We are grateful for the outstanding police work by the NYPD who were able to locate and arrest the person who attacked one of our riders within 24 (sic) of the incident,\" said MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber on the incident in a statement shared with CNN. \"We will always stand up for our customers and their safety, and we expect this perpetrator of a hate crime will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\"The incident comes amid a spate of recent subway attacks that have pushed city officials to implement new safety measures to combat crime. Mayor Eric Adams, a former transit police officer, and Gov. Kathy Hochul highlighted a joint initiative last month to deploy law enforcement agencies and social services to tackle the issue.Michelle Go's death hasn't been labeled a hate crime but it adds to the fear that Asian Americans feelSeveral of the attacks have targeted Asian Americans, including the death of 40-year-old Michelle Alyssa Go, who was pushed in front of a Times Square subway train in January. The NYPD described her death as a \"random\" attack, and it was not investigated as an anti-Asian hate crime.Still, hate crimes against Asian Americans have increased significantly over the past two years due to what experts say is anti-Asian bigotry related to the Covid-19 pandemic, which originated in Wuhan, China. In New York, hate crimes involving Asian Americans increased from 28 in 2020 to at least 129 incidents in 2021, said James Essig, NYPD chief of detectives, in a news conference in December. The subway attacks have been particularly pronounced this year. There have been 54 incidents of crime that occurred within the New York City Transit system so far in 2022, compared to 19 incidents at this point last year, according to NYPD data. This marks a 184.2% increase in crimes committed within the transit system, which include grand larceny, robbery, and felony assault.Three weeks ago, a 57-year-old scientist with the NYC Department of Health was hit with a hammer several times and robbed at the Queens Plaza subway station. A man was arrested and charged with attempted murder for the incident, police said.The victim in the attack, Nina Rothschild, is relearning how to walk and climb stairs and is recovering from other injuries, including a broken arm, her brother Gerson Rothschild told CNN. \"She is very cheerful -- no change at all in personality or cognitive abilities -- and very determined to overcome her problems and I believe she will and will return to work at the Department of Health,\" he said.CNN's Laura Studley, Mark Morales, and Eric Levenson contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Former \"Empire\" actor Jussie Smollett was sentenced Thursday to 30 months of felony probation, including 150 days in jail, and ordered to pay restitution of more than $120,000 and a $25,000 fine for making false reports to police that he was the victim of a hate crime in January 2019. After the judge announced his sentence, Smollett lowered his face mask and said he was innocent. \"Your honor, I respect you and I respect the jury, but I did not do this,\" the actor told the judge, before turning to the court. \"And I am not suicidal. And if anything happens to me when I go in there, I did not do it to myself. And you must all know that.\"Actor Jussie Smollett found guilty of lying to police in hate crime hoaxJust before he was taken into custody, the actor yelled again that he was innocent and raised a fist in the air. Cook County Judge James Linn spoke for more than 30 minutes before announcing Smollett's sentence, telling the actor that he wrote the script and picked the actors for the hoax, and that his premeditation for the act was an \"aggravating factor\" in the case.\"There's a side of you that has this arrogance, and selfishness and narcissism that's just disgraceful,\" the judge said. \"You're not a victim of a racial hate crime, you're not a victim of a homophobic hate crime. You're just a charlatan pretending to be a victim of a hate crime, and that's shameful.\"Read MoreThe judge ordered Smollett to be held in protective custody \"by Mr. Smollett's request and this court's recommendation,\" according to court documents obtained by CNN.On Friday, the actor was being housed \"in his own cell, which is monitored by security cameras in the cell and by an officer wearing a body worn camera who is stationed at the entrance of the cell to ensure that Mr. Smollett is under direct observation at all times,\" the Cook County Sheriff's Office said.The office stressed Smollett was not being held in solitary confinement, noting he is entitled to \"substantial time out of his cell\" and is able to use a telephone, watch TV and interact with staff. Social justice figures urged for leniencySmollett, 39, was found guilty in December on five counts of felony disorderly conduct for making false reports about what he said was an anti-gay and anti-Black hate crime. The actor, who is Black and gay, told Chicago police that on a frigid night in January 2019 two unknown men attacked him, yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him, poured bleach on him and wrapped a noose around his neck. Celebrities and politicians rushed to defend him publicly, and Chicago police investigated the case as a possible hate crime. But they soon determined the actor orchestrated the incident and paid two brothers he knew from the Fox drama \"Empire\" to stage the incident for publicity.Smollett maintained his innocence under oath during the trial, but the jury convicted him on five of six felony charges after nine hours of deliberations. While a conviction for disorderly conduct for a false crime report is punishable by up to three years in prison, it is rare for a judge to sentence an offender with no prior felony convictions to prison time for the charge.Prosecutors on Thursday urged the judge to give Smollett an \"appropriate\" sentence, pointing to the fact that the actor has never taken responsibility for his actions and saying he may have hurt efforts of real hate crime victims to come forward. Smollett's attorneys argued that he should be given a more lenient punishment such a probation, citing his lack of criminal history and community service he has performed. They read several letters which attested to that part of his life. Before announcing the sentence, the judge also spoke of the leading figures in social justice circles that asked for a lenient sentence for Smollett. \"You do have quite a record of real community service and quite a record of attaching with people,\" the judge said. \"I'm mindful of pleas of mercy, particularly from people that are in the arena.\"But ultimately, the judge said, this act showed Smollett's \"dark side.\"Smollett attorney Tina Glandian also argued the guilty verdict should be overturned and a new trial granted based on legal errors leading up to and during the trial. Judge Linn denied the defense's request, saying he believed Smollett received a fair trial.Smollett's attorneys have indicated they plan to appeal his conviction. 'He shamed my brother'In a news conference following the sentencing, Smollett's brother, Jojo Smollett, told reporters he was disappointed with the outcome. \"He shamed my brother. He spoke about his arrogance,\" Jojo Smollett said. \"He doesn't know the struggles my brother is encountering. He doesn't know anything that he's dealing with.\"Chicago Police body camera footage from the night of the incident showed Smollett with a noose still around his neck. He testified that he removed the noose after the attack but then put it back on to show police.Jazz Smollett, the actor's sister, called the decision a \"miscarriage of justice.\"\"My brother is innocent,\" Smollett's sister said. \"This should not be a controversial statement because it is the absolute truth.\"Special Prosecutor Daniel Webb said he was \"extraordinarily pleased\" with the sentence, adding that Smollett's  \"conduct denigrated hate crimes.\" Webb said the judge's comments showed \"he clearly has understood ... that this was a course of conduct that deserved severe punishment.\"Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx also commented on the sentencing. Foxx had separated herself from the case to address potential concerns of impartiality over \"familiarity with potential witnesses,\" her office previously said. In March 2019, a grand jury indicted Smollett on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct. In a dramatic reversal days later, the state's attorney office dropped all charges. In an op-ed published in the Chicago Sun-TImes on Thursday night, Foxx said the justice system \"failed\" in Smollett's case by pursuing his prosecution, which cost taxpayers \"millions.\" Foxx defended her office's decision to drop the initial charges, saying Smollett had already forfeited a $10,000 bond, had never been accused of a violent crime and already paid a \"reputational price.\"But, Foxx wrote, because of a \"relentless, organized and effective\" mob that criticized the decision, a special prosecutor was later assigned the case and Smollett was \"indicted, tried and convicted by a kangaroo prosecution in a matter of months.\"In a separate statement Thursday night, the Cook County State's Attorney's Office said it will \"continue to prioritize violent crime and supporting victims as we respond to the relentless violence we are seeing.\"How we got hereSmollett was initially indicted in March 2019 on 16 counts of felony disorderly conduct after police determined his reports were false. The decision from Foxx's office to drop all charges set off debate over whether Smollett had received preferential treatment, leading a judge to appoint Webb, the special prosecutor to look into it in August 2019. That led to a second grand jury, which in February 2020 indicted Smollett on the six felony charges.What Jussie Smollett's guilty verdicts tell usThe incident effectively ended Smollett's acting career. His character was written out of \"Empire,\" which ended in 2020, and though he has since directed and produced a film, he's yet to appear in another TV or film acting role.In court late last year, the brothers, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, were among seven witnesses for the prosecution at the trial. They testified that Smollett directed them and paid them to stage the attack in an attempt to garner sympathetic media coverage. \"Who was in charge of this thing?\" special prosecutor Dan Webb asked.\"Jussie was,\" Abimbola Osundairo told the jury.Smollett testified in his own defense to deny any such plan and said he paid the brothers only for training advice and nutritional tips. He cast doubt on their true motivations and said he had a sexual relationship with one of the brothers, which the brother denied.Smollett has no prior feloniesThe primary question at sentencing was whether Smollett, who has no prior felonies, would be sentenced to prison.CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney Joey Jackson previously told CNN that Smollett \"exposed himself to jail time\" when he testified in court.\"What Jussie Smollett said was resoundingly rejected by that jury. The jury did not buy what he was selling. That's not lost upon a judge. You came into the courtroom and fabricated,\" Jackson said.The city of Chicago also filed a lawsuit against Smollett in April 2019 after the actor declined to pay the city $130,106.15 for the police investigation, court documents show. Smollett filed a countersuit in November 2020.Chicago's Department of Law noted in the city's suit that over two dozen police officers and detectives spent weeks working on Smollett's case in 2019, resulting in 1,836 overtime hours.Following Smollett's conviction in December, the city said it intended to continue pursuing its lawsuit.During the sentencing, the judge highlighted the amount of police work that went into the investigation, telling Smollett that police resources are valuable and limited. \"You took away a lot of resources from other places, from other real victims of real crimes and used up the police resources for your own benefit, and that's a big problem here,\" the judge said.

        "content": "(CNN)Actor Jussie Smollett is headed to jail for lying to police and orchestrating a hate crime hoax, but with his legal proceedings largely over, the questions now turn to the former \"Empire\" star's future in Hollywood.On any potential return to acting, a Smollett family representative told CNN, \"clearly he would like to\" but also that at the moment \"everything is up in the air.\"Hollywood is no stranger to handing out redemption to talented men and women who make mistakes, whether it be an offense that lands them in Twitter jail or actual jail. The question is whether Smollett will clear the invisible bar set for him to make his way back onto screens big and small or end up on a list of uncastable actors. There are indications that at least some notable figures in Hollywood have not distanced himself from Smollett, who got his start in the industry at 12 years old in a short-lived ABC's sitcom in which he starred alongside his siblings. At a hearing on Thursday, at which Smollett was sentenced to 150 days in jail, Smollett's team presented the judge with letters of support from actor Samuel L. Jackson and his wife LaTanya, among others. Read MoreIn their letter, the couple argued that Smollett should be spared jail time and that the 39-year-old \"has already suffered a great deal of punishment as this situation has destroyed his existing career and impuned his reputation.\" Smollett's sister, Jurnee Smollett, arguably the most acclaimed of the family's six entertainer siblings, remains well connected and regarded in the industry, as well. Even as the family navigated Jussie Smollett's legal troubles, she was among the cast of HBO's horror drama \"Lovecraft Country,\" which debuted in 2020. (CNN, like HBO, is owned by WarnerMedia.) It was on the press tour for that series that the actress, known for her past roles on shows like WGN's \"Underground\" and HBO's \"True Blood,\" publicly opened up about her brother's scandal in detail and reiterated her support for him.Smollett was found guilty back in December on five counts of felony disorderly conduct for making false reports about what he said was an anti-gay and anti-Black hate crime. The actor, who is Black and gay, told Chicago police that in January 2019, two unknown men attacked him, yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him, poured bleach on him and wrapped a noose around his neck.Chicago police investigated the case as a possible hate crime and at the time, celebrities and politicians rushed to defend him publicly.  That support wavered as the incident's twists and turns played out, particularly as investigators soon determined the actor orchestrated the incident and paid two brothers he knew from the Fox drama \"Empire\" to stage the incident for publicity.On Thursday, the silence from some of Smollett's original defenders was deafening.Actress Yvette Nicole Brown was an exception. Among those who expressed her \"love\" for the Smollett family in 2019, Brown shared her thoughts once again on Friday, tweeting, \"The way that judge reprimanded Jussie, you'd think he murdered 2 people or used a gun instead of a taser on a Black man at a traffic stop.\" Smollett's attorneys have indicated they intend to appeal.CNN's Jason Kravarik and Brad Parks contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Immigration arrests in the United States have plunged under President Joe Biden compared to his predecessor, who cast a wide net of who was eligible to be taken into custody, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement data released Friday.   Under Biden, the Department of Homeland Security rolled out a series of policy changes that marked a departure from the Trump administration's aggressive enforcement measures. That included modifying guidance to focus arrests on national security, public safety and border security risks.  ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations made more than 74,000 administrative arrests -- for immigration violations -- in fiscal year 2021, according to agency data, down from the Trump administration when annual administrative arrests hovered over 100,000. ICE, under the previous administration, had given officers more latitude to make arrests.   Senior ICE officials on Friday emphasized the impact of the pandemic on operations, pointing out the difficulty of comparing the data to past years. \"I can't overemphasize how impactful Covid has been on the agency over this, really the past year and a half, but certainly this fiscal year,\" a senior official said, noting shutdowns, and other countries that refused to accept deportations cases. Read MoreThe fiscal year 2021 data encompasses the final months of the Trump administration and the start of the Biden era. Of the total arrests conducted, 45,755 occurred after ICE modified its guidance last February under Biden, newly released data shows. Nearly half of those arrests were of convicted criminals, while 55% of those arrested were classified as \"threats to border security,\" which includes people apprehended by US Border Patrol.   The return to a priority system for arrests was among several policy changes instituted under Biden. Over the last year, ICE also ended contracts with two detention centers, stopped long-term detention of families, discontinued mass worksite immigration raids, and began moving toward alternatives to detention, like ankle bracelets. A senior ICE official told reporters Friday the \"focused approach yielded measurable success,\" including, for example, a doubling of arrests of aggravated felonies over the prior year. Deportations also dropped dramatically in the first year of the Biden administration. ICE deported around 59,000 last year, down from 185,884 the year before.  Overseeing the structural changes is acting ICE Director Tae Johnson, who's remained at the helm of the agency during the months-long confirmation process for Biden's pick to lead ICE, Ed Gonzalez.  This week, Gonzalez's confirmation hit a snag after Senate Democrats withdrew a vote to advance his nomination when an alleged domestic complaint surfaced. The White House has said it still stands by Gonzalez, who called the accusations in the complaint false. While immigrant advocates and Democratic lawmakers have welcomed change at ICE, they've been critical of the continued use of private detention and access to Covid-19 vaccines for those who are detained.  Earlier this month, the American Civil Liberties Union also filed a nationwide class-action lawsuit against ICE, claiming that the federal agency has failed to provide Covid-19 booster vaccines to medically vulnerable detainees.",

        "content": "(CNN)Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has devastated the country, killing hundreds of civilians, sparking a humanitarian disaster and resulting in a wave of sanctions from the West. Following the constant flow of developments can be confusing and overwhelming. As the war in Ukraine continues, here's a guide to some of the terms you may have heard or seen: What they mean, and why they matter. DPR and LPRThese are acronyms for two pro-Russian separatist-held regions in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine: the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LPR). Read MoreThe breakaway territories have been the site of a low-intensity war since 2014, when Russian-backed rebels seized government buildings across the region. The eight-year conflict has left more than 14,000 people dead. Kyiv and the West insist that the self-declared republics are part of Ukraine, although the Ukrainian government asserts that the two regions are, in effect, Russian-occupied, and refuses to talk directly with either the DPR or LPR.On February 21, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed decrees recognizing the independence of the separatist territories, and ordered his troops into the region on what the Kremlin called a \"peacekeeping\" operation. The move was widely seen by the West as the opening salvo of a larger military operation targeting Ukraine. Three days later, Russian forces invaded the country.\n\nShellingRussia has relied heavily on shelling key Ukrainian cities and towns as it seeks to seize control of locations in the country. Shelling refers to artillery fire from large guns, and has been used against administrative and residential buildings. Dozens of deaths as a result of Russian shelling have been reported by Ukrainian emergency services. United Nations officials say more than 500 civilians have died since the invasion, from all causes including air strikes and shelling -- though they caution that the true number is likely to be far higher.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russian forces of shelling indiscriminately since the invasion began. In a message on his Facebook page last Friday, he said Russian troops have been \"shelling our people, our children, residential neighborhoods, churches, schools, destroying everything that provides a normal life, human life.\"'Humanitarian corridors'Humanitarian corridors are demilitarized pathways out of or into fighting zones during a war, which allow people to flee conflict or allow aid to be brought in. They are intended to reduce civilian casualties. Ukraine has called on global leaders to pressure Putin to open such corridors and \"prevent a large scale humanitarian catastrophe\" in Ukrainian cities.But the \"humanitarian corridors\" being discussed by Russian officials in the Ukraine conflict largely do not meet this description. Ukrainian officials rejected one unilateral Kremlin proposal for evacuation corridors for civilians as an unacceptable non-starter -- since most of the routes lead to Russia or its staunch ally Belarus, and would require people to travel through active areas of fighting.A man carries a woman as they cross an improvised path to flee the town of Irpin, near Kyiv.In recent days, hopes for opening up safe evacuation corridors for civilians out of a number of cities have been repeatedly dashed, with Ukraine accusing Russia of attacking escape routes.\"Evacuation through humanitarian corridors is only possible when the ceasefire regime is fully upheld. The Ukrainian side is ready for that,\" the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Monday.NATOThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization is a defense alliance of 30 North American and European nations. According to NATO, its purpose \"is to guarantee the freedom and security of its members through political and military means.\"The group was created in 1949, as the Cold War escalated. Its original purpose was to protect the West from the threat posed by the Soviet Union. Since the end of the Cold War, many former Soviet nations have joined NATO, to the frustration of Putin, who sees it as a threat. Ukraine is not a member of NATO, but has long hoped to join the alliance -- something Russia vehemently opposes.The best-known aspect of the NATO alliance is Article 5 of its treaty, which states that \"an attack against one Ally is considered as an attack against all Allies.\"Since Ukraine is not part of NATO, the alliance is not compelled to protect the country in the same way it would if a NATO member nation was attacked; indeed, countries from the alliance have said they have no intention of sending their troops into Ukraine. But many of Ukraine's neighbors are members, and if a Russian attack extended into one of those countries, Article 5 could trigger direct involvement from the US and other NATO members.And the alliance can take collective defense measures without invoking Article 5. It has done just that in recent weeks, increasing land, sea and air forces on its eastern flank; Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas has also asked for a more permanent NATO deployment in the Baltics. No-fly zoneA no-fly zone is an area where certain aircraft cannot fly for any number of reasons. In the context of this invasion, it would likely mean a zone where Russian planes are not allowed to fly, in order to prevent them from carrying out airstrikes on Ukraine. Zelensky has urged NATO to institute a no-fly zone, but NATO's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has said that it is not an option being considered by the alliance. If it imposed a no-fly zone over Ukraine, NATO would likely have to step in to enforce it, at the risk of escalating the conflict.Why hasn't NATO imposed a no-fly zone in Ukraine?NATO has imposed no-fly zones in non-member countries before, including in Bosnia and Libya, but doing so is always a controversial move because it means getting involved in a conflict without fully committing ground forces. Putin has said that any countries imposing a no-fly zone will be considered as participants in the armed conflict. If NATO were to do this over Ukraine, it could lead Russia to retaliate against NATO member states.Javelins and StingersThe US and other Western nations have been sending key military equipment to Ukraine to assist in its fight against Russia. These include portable anti-aircraft missiles known as Stingers, which are launched by soldiers on the ground to bring down aircraft flying overhead. They allow troops on foot to engage in the battle for Ukraine's skies.Ukraine and Russia's militaries are David and Goliath. Here's how they comparePortable anti-tank weapons, including US-made Javelin missiles, are also being sent to Ukrainian forces. Also launched by ground troops, these target heavy-duty military vehicles including tanks, and work to slow and disrupt Russian military convoys as they move towards key locations. The US and NATO have so far sent Ukraine 17,000 anti-tank missiles and 2,000 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, a senior US official told CNN on Monday. There are different generations of Stingers that the US produces and US officials have been cognizant of not providing the newest model to the Ukrainians in case they fall into the hands of Russia, which could steal the US technology.  Cluster and 'vacuum' bombsNATO's Stoltenberg has accused Russia of using cluster bombs as part of its attacks on Ukrainian cities. These are bombs that not only deliver an initial explosion on impact, but also contain multiple smaller bombs that spread over a wide area. They are largely condemned by the international community due to the risk of civilian casualties when they are used in populated areas.US President Joe Biden's envoy to the United Nations has separately accused Russia of preparing to use banned weapons, including \"cluster munitions and vacuum bombs,\" in Ukraine. \"Vacuum bombs,\" or thermobaric weapons, suck in the oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a powerful explosion and a large pressure wave that can have enormous destructive effects. Russia previously used thermobaric weapons in Chechnya with horrifying consequences, according to Human Rights Watch. A CNN team spotted a Russian thermobaric multiple rockets launcher near the border with Ukraine in late February. War crimesThe Geneva Convention, signed in 1949 in the wake of World War II, establishes global standards that must be observed during warfare.The International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, Netherlands, can prosecute grave breaches of those standards; it has specific definitions for genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression.Everything you need to know about war crimes and how Putin could be prosecutedThe ICC has already launched an active investigation into possible war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine, including targeting civilian populations, violating the Geneva Convention and targeting specific groups of people. The US Embassy in Kyiv alleged on Friday that Russia had committed a war crime by attacking the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine -- the largest in Europe. \"It is a war crime to attack a nuclear power plant,\" the embassy said on its official Twitter feed. \"Putin's shelling of Europe's largest nuclear plant takes his reign of terror one step further.\"SanctionsSanctions are economic penalties applied by one country against another, or against specific companies or people. Western nations have imposed a stream of tough sanctions on Russia that have stunned its economy since Moscow invaded Ukraine. Measures imposed on the country have included cutting off Russia's two largest banks, Sberbank and VTB, from trading in US dollars and removing seven institutions from SWIFT, a global messaging service that connects financial institutions and facilitates rapid and secure payments -- essentially isolating Russian banks from the Western financial system.As a result, the value of the Russian currency, the ruble, and of several Russian companies trading on foreign exchanges, has plummeted.Key individuals linked to the Kremlin have also been targeted, with Western nations moving to seize their properties or assets.SWIFTOf all the Western sanctions imposed Moscow so far, perhaps the most damaging is the removal of some Russian banks from SWIFT. What is SWIFT and how is it being used against Russia?The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication was founded in 1973, replacing the telex, and is now used by more than 11,000 financial institutions to send secure messages and payment orders.SWIFT doesn't move money around the world. What it does is allow banks to send each other instructions on how to transfer funds across borders. With no globally accepted alternative, it is essential plumbing for global finance.Disconnecting an entire country from SWIFT is considered the nuclear option of economic sanctions.CNN's Ivana Kottasova, Luke McGee, Paul LeBlanc, Zachary B.

        "content": "(CNN)Tina Peters, the county clerk in Mesa County, Colorado, and her deputy clerk, Belinda Knisley, have been indicted by a county grand jury stemming from an election security breach investigation by local authorities. District Attorney Dan Rubinstein announced Wednesday morning that Peters faces 10 counts, including three felony counts of attempting to influence a public servant, two felony counts of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation, one felony count of identity theft, and misdemeanor counts for first-degree official misconduct, violation of duty and failing to comply with requirements of the Colorado secretary of state. Knisley faces six counts, including three felony counts of attempting to influence a public servant, one felony count of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation, and misdemeanor counts for violation of duty and failing to comply with the requirements of the secretary of state.  Warrants were issued for Peters' and Knisley's arrests. Both of their bonds were set at $500,000 cash only. The Mesa County Sheriff's Office said in an emailed statement Wednesday evening that Peters had turned herself in to the Mesa County Detention Facility. Knisley has been booked into the Mesa County Jail, according to sheriff's office spokesperson Megan Terlecky. Colorado county clerk turns herself in to authorities for charges of obstructing a peace officer and obstructing government operations\"Yesterday, the Mesa County grand jury returned an indictment after the presentation of evidence in an ongoing investigation into the alleged election system breach in Mesa County,\" Rubinstein and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said in a statement. \"The grand jury, randomly selected from the same pool of citizens that elected Clerk Tina Peters and chosen months before any of these alleged offenses occurred, concluded there is probable cause that Clerk Peters and Deputy Clerk Knisley committed crimes.\"Read MorePeters, a pro-Trump Republican running for Colorado secretary of state this year, has publicly asserted that the investigation was partisan and politically motivated. In a statement on her campaign website Wednesday, she said the grand jury indictment was \"one of the last cards the Democrats have to play here.\"\"Using legal muscle to indict political opponents during an election isn't new strategy, but it's easier to execute when you have a district attorney who despises President Trump and any constitutional conservative like myself who continues to demand all election evidence be made available to the public,\" she said.CNN has reached out to attorneys for Peters and Knisley for comment on the indictments.A district judge set new bond terms for the women Thursday after hearing arguments from Rubenstein and their attorneys. Peters' bond was set as a $25,000 cash surety bond that must be paid by her and not a third party. She is not allowed to have contact with Knisley, the victims mentioned in her felony indictment or any employee in the Mesa County Clerk and Recorder office. She also must turn over her passport and must seek the court's permission before traveling outside Colorado.The judge set Knisley's personal recognizance bond at $10,000. She also is not allowed to have contact with Peters, the alleged victims or employees in the Clerk and Recorder Office, except for a family member who works in the office. The sheriff's office confirmed Thursday that Knisley and Peters had been released on bond.Both women are scheduled to be arraigned on May 24.The criminal investigation into the clerk's office began after Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat, accused Peters and her deputies of facilitating a security breach in May. The breach resulted in confidential voting machine logins, and forensic images of their hard drives, being published in a QAnon-affiliated Telegram channel in early August 2021, according to previous CNN reporting.Beginning in April 2021, according to the indictment, in advance of a May 25-26, 2021, trusted build of voting machines, Peters and Knisley \"devised and executed a deceptive scheme\" to influence public servants, breach security protocols, exceed permissible access to voting equipment, and set in motion the eventual distribution of confidential information to unauthorized people. A \"trusted build\" is \"the origin of the chain-of-custody for any software and firmware component of the voting system,\" according to the indictment.In a statement released after the indictment, Griswold said Peters' actions \"constituted one of the nation's first insider threats where an official, elected to uphold free, fair, and secure selections risked the integrity of the election system in an effort to prove unfounded conspiracy theories.\"Every eligible Coloradan -- Republican, Democrat, and Unaffiliated alike -- has the right to make their voice heard in safe, accessible, and secure elections,\" added Griswold. \"To do that, we need election administrators who are committed to following the law and election rules. Officials tasked with carrying out elections do so in public trust and must be held accountable when they abuse their power or position.\" On Friday, Peters is scheduled to appear in a Mesa County court on two separate charges of obstructing a peace officer and obstructing government operations when she was arrested by Grand Junction police at a local business in early February.This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.

Colin Allred, told ESPN a day earlier.\"I do think that it's really unusual that we've not been granted access to her from our embassy and our consular services,\" Allred, D-Texas, told ESPN on Wednesday.\"The Russian criminal justice system is very different than ours, very opaque. We don't have a lot of insight into where she is in that process right now, but she's been held for three weeks now, and that's extremely concerning,\" Allred said.News of Griner's arrest broke in the US last weekend, with Russian media reporting she was detained at a Moscow airport on some unspecified day in February. Read MoreAllred's office has been working with the US State Department and learned she was detained February 17, he told ESPN. His office confirmed that date to CNN on Thursday.A State Department spokesperson said Thursday the department is \"aware of and closely engaged on this case.\"Many details still are in question, including precisely where Griner is now.Russian authorities said Griner, 31, had cannabis oil in her luggage while at the airport and accused her of smuggling significant amounts of a narcotic substance, an offense the Russian government says is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.Basketball star Brittney Griner is the latest American to be detained in Russia as supporters work desperately to free themGriner, a two-time Olympic basketball gold medalist and WNBA star, plays for the Russian club UMMC Ekaterinburg during the WNBA offseason. A photo posted to social media on February 16 appears to show Griner at a hotel in New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. Four days later, Griner's Russian team played in a game and she was not in the lineup.As word spread in the US of Griner's plight, legislators have pushed for the federal government to intervene. The Biden administration is working to try to get Griner out of Russia, members of the Congressional Black Caucus said after meeting Monday with President Joe Biden.The backdrop of Russia's invasion of Ukraine -- which has led to widespread international condemnation and the severing of many diplomatic ties -- has led analysts and government officials to note it may be very difficult to get Griner and other Americans incarcerated in Russia back home.Supporters of Griner and two Americans who've been detained in Russia much longer -- Trevor Reed and Paul Whelan -- having been pleading for help freeing their loved ones, even as diplomatic channels fade. Reed, 30, and Whelan, 52, were arrested and convicted separately for alleged crimes they've emphatically denied well before the Russian incursion of Ukraine, and the pair remain in prison, serving extended sentences denounced by US officials as unfair. \"What's obviously different (in Griner's case) is that Brittney is an extremely high-profile athlete, and it's happening during the course of a Russian-begun war in Ukraine, in which we are deeply opposed to what they're doing,\" Allred told ESPN.Allred hopes the US can move quickly to get Griner out of Russia, he told ESPN.\"I'm sure her lawyer in Russia is working through the process, but every day for anyone being held, particularly being held overseas, is a lifetime,\" Allred said. \"I recognize that for her friends and family, this must be incredibly difficult time. And for her, I'm sure the uncertainty about what's happening is probably just terrible. And so, hopefully, whatever happens, we can get this moving quickly and get her out.\"The current location of Brittney Griner, seen here during Game Three of the 2021 WNBA semifinals in October, has not been publicly revealed.Little clarity over what comes nextThe scarcity of details provided by Russian authorities has troubled those close to Griner and has others asking what, if anything, can be done to ensure her safety and freedom while Russian troops mount their offensive against Ukrainians. Citing a law enforcement source, the Russian news agency TASS identified an American woman arrested on drug charges at a Moscow airport as Griner, according to The New York Times. The Russian Federal Customs Service confirmed the arrest of an American athlete in February yet did not identify the person by name nor the exact date of the arrest, per a statement initially reported Saturday by Russia's Interfax News Agency.What Brittney Griner's quiet face is saying to the worldThe customs service said the American was placed in pretrial detention and noted a criminal case was opened for smuggling significant amounts of narcotic substances, and the offense carries a punishment of up to 10 years imprisonment. \"The customs inspection of the hand luggage being carried by the US citizen confirmed the presence of vapes with specifically smelling liquid, and an expert determined that the liquid was cannabis oil (hash oil), which is a narcotic substance,\" the customs service said.Russian state-owned news channel Russia 24 reported a photo was taken by authorities of Griner at a police station holding a sign with her name on it.A member of the US House Armed Services Committee told CNN on Monday that \"it's going to be very difficult\" to get Griner out of Russia. \"Our diplomatic relationships with Russia are nonexistent at the moment,\" US Rep. John Garamendi, D-California, said. \"Perhaps during the various negotiations that may take place, she might be able to be one of the solutions. I don't know.\"Brittney Griner: Why so many WNBA stars play basketball overseasHe also noted that \"Russia has some very, very strict LGBT rules and laws\" -- though it's not clear whether those rules and laws might impact the case of Griner, who is gay and married. Russia has passed LGBTQ-related legislation and outlawed the \"propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors.\"Organizations such as the WNBA, the Phoenix Mercury and the WNBA players' union have shared their concerns for Griner and their hopes for her safety. The WNBA's other players have left Russia and Ukraine, it has said.The arrest of one of the top athletes in women's basketball also has struck a chord with many Americans. An online petition started on Change.org by Tamryn Spruill, a journalist covering women's basketball, has garnered tens of thousands of signatures. Griner's high school basketball coach, Debbie Jackson, worries Griner's case will be used for political purposes, she told CNN this week.\"My biggest fear is that ... she will become a political pawn,\" Jackson said.Griner's wife, Cherelle Griner, shared Monday on Instagram her and others' grief over the situation and the scarcity of information provided from overseas. \"We love you babe! People say 'stay busy.' Yet, there's not a task in this world that could keep any of us from wondering if you are safe,\" she said.\"My heart, our hearts, are all skipping beats everyday that goes by without hearing from you. I miss your voice. I miss your presence. You're our person! There are no words to express this pain. I'm hurting, we're hurting.

The Class 3 misdemeanor charge, which could carry a maximum penalty of up to 20 days in jail, is one of three pending traffic citations against the Republican congressman in his home state. The charge was first reported by the Asheville Citizen-Times.According to North Carolina Highway Patrol spokesperson Marcus Bethea, at 10:26 p.m. on March 3, a trooper pulled over \"a 2019 Toyota for a left of center violation on US 74B in Cleveland County.\"Bethea said that after determining Cawthorn's license \"was in a state of revoke,\" the driver was charged and given a court date of May 6. Read MoreCourt records show a previous charge against Cawthorn of driving while license revoked in 2017 was dismissed in Buncombe County. According to Bethea and court calendars, the 26-year-old congressman also faces two additional charges of speeding issued by the NCHP in separate incidents in different counties. On October 18, 2021, according to a synopsis provided by Bethea, Cawthorn was pulled over in Buncombe County in a 2009 white Dodge for \"driving 89 mph in a 65-mph zone.\"  Court records list his court date for that violation as May 3.And on January 8, 2022, the congressman was pulled over in a 2009 Dodge by state highway patrol in Polk County. Bethea told CNN that Cawthorn was cited for \"driving 87 mph in a 70-mph zone.\" He has an April 18 court date.Luke Ball, Cawthorn's communications director, told CNN in a statement: \"Our office expects the traffic matters to be resolved quickly and we remain focused on serving the constituents of NC-11.\"In North Carolina, a license can be revoked for several reasons, including moving violations while license is suspended, speeding and accumulation of points, among other violations. It is not known why Cawthorn's license was revoked. Driver license histories are confidential under federal privacy law.Correction: A previous version of this story misrepresented the time period in which one of the citations occurred. Cawthorn was pulled over on January 8, 2022.",

        "content": "(CNN)When Sherri Papini claimed she was abducted in Northern California, investigators were led to believe they were looking for two Hispanic women who spoke Spanish, played Mariachi music and fed her mostly tortillas and rice. Papini's elaborate story of her 2016 kidnapping, which federal prosecutors now allege was false, reinforced a number of racist stereotypes and the anti-Latino rhetoric that has fueled racial division across the United States in recent years, advocates and scholars say.\"She fell into stereotypes about the Latino community that are far too prevalent in the population at large but clearly, she was also counting on law enforcement relying upon stereotypes,\" said Thomas Saenz, the president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), a Latino legal civil rights group. California woman's alleged fake abduction cost the public hundreds of thousands of dollars, authorities sayNearly six years after she went missing in Shasta County, the 39-year-old mother of two has been charged with making false statements to a federal law enforcement officer and mail fraud, the Department of Justice said.  If convicted, she faces up to 25 years in prison. Papini, who was was arrested last week, was released on bond and mandated to receive psychiatric treatment by a federal judge on Tuesday.CNN has reached out multiple times to Michael Borges, an attorney for Papini, for comment.Read MoreIn a 55-page affidavit filed last week in federal court, prosecutors detailed what Papini told authorities after she was found. She told police she was abducted and branded by two Hispanic women who kept her chained in a closet. Papini mentioned hearing them talking about a buyer and getting paid for the kidnapping, the document states.While Papini offered only a few details about her alleged abductors, claiming they wore masks and she could not understand them because they mostly spoke Spanish, the way she described their appearance and behavior signaled a biased view of Latinas, said Stephanie L. Canizales, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of California at Merced.Two sketches released by the FBI were based on Papini's description of her alleged abductors.She told police that one of them wore \"those big hoop earrings\" and had thin, \"almost drawn in\" eyebrows, according to the affidavit. A sketch based on Papini's statements and released by the FBI showed one of the women wearing a bandana over her face.Canizales, who has researched the causes and consequences of racism against Latinos, said Papini's description of the alleged abductors aligned with tropes of Mexican women in which hoop earrings and bandanas are linked to the cholo/chola subculture and proximity to gang culture.The political climate at the time of the alleged fake abduction can't be ignored, said Saenz, the president and general counsel of MALDEF.  Anti-Latino sentiment had been surging and Papini's story likely fed into it. In 2015 and 2016, former President Donald Trump centered part of his campaign on offensive remarks about Mexican immigrants, calling them criminals. For Saenz, that behavior ultimately gave \"license\" to those who listened to Trump to openly \"indulge in racial stereotypes about not just Mexican immigrants but other Latino immigrants and more broadly about the Latino population regardless of citizenship.\"The impact on the Latino communityThe search for Papini and her claims to police in 2016 took a financial and mental cost in a county with a growing Hispanic community, Shasta County Sheriff Michael Johnson has said.Sherri PapiniIn all, the cost of the investigation borne by public safety agencies was an estimated $150,000, Johnson said in a statement on Facebook last week. The case also diverted resources from real cases with real victims.\"Not only did this charade take valuable resources away from real criminal investigative matters,\" the sheriff said, \"but in a time where there is serious human trafficking cases with legitimate victims Sherri Papini used this tragic societal phenomenon to gain notoriety and financial gain.\"In a 2020 report, the anti-trafficking organization Polaris said thousands of women and girls from Mexico, Central America, Latino communities in the US are victims of sex and labor trafficking across the country. In California, advocates and lawmakers have said human trafficking is \"rampant,\" \"pervasive\" and many victims are Black and Hispanic women. \"Not only did this charade take valuable resources away from real criminal investigative matters,\" Johnson said, \"but in a time where there is serious human trafficking cases with legitimate victims Sherri Papini used this tragic societal phenomenon to gain notoriety and financial gain.\"Bill Garcia, a private investigator who volunteered to help find Papini in 2016, said Shasta County sits on Intestate 5, which is known to be a corridor for trafficking between Mexico and Canada. That made me him believe Papini could be a possible target of trafficking like other women in the region. 'Racialization of crime' played a role, scholar saysSome people have drawn comparisons between Papini's case and the behavior that other White women have shown in past controversial interactions with people of color.In 2020, Amy Cooper, a White woman, called police on a Black man while he was birdwatching in New York's Central Park. The incident, which was partially filmed and posted on Facebook by the man, Christian Cooper (no relation), was shared widely as another example of White people calling the police on Black people for mundane things. In the recording, he is silent for the most part, while she frantically tells police he is threatening her and her dog. Amy Cooper faced a misdemeanor charge of falsely reporting an incident to police but the Manhattan District Attorney's Office dropped the charge last year after she completed education and therapy classes on racial equity.\"She wasn't under threat, but she had very much internalized that 'if a Black man is speaking to me, I'm being threatened and when I tell the police that a Black man is threatening me they will believe me,\" Canizales said. \"In the Sherri Papini case, she was evoking the same sort of racialization of crime.\"When Papini described her alleged abductors as Mexican women, she had a similar confidence \"that no one would question her because the public has accepted that this is what criminal looks like,\" Canizales said.Advocates and scholars said the notion that Latinos are viewed as part of a migration crisis or being criminal has not stopped or disappeared. \"It's a great concern that we are in 2022 and we are dealing not with less, but in many ways with more open statements of racial bias against the Latino community,\" Saenz said.",

        "content": "(CNN)A federal judge dismissed on Wednesday a January 6 lawsuit brought against Rep. Mo Brooks that had alleged the Alabama Republican engaged in a civil conspiracy. US District Judge Amit Mehta's move to dismiss the claims against Brooks was anticipated. Mehta wrote in a previous opinion in the case, which was brought by California Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell, that he was inclined to dismiss the claims against Brooks and the judge invited Brooks to formally request the dismissal.Mehta on Wednesday also denied as moot a request from Brooks that the judge certify that the House member was acting in his official capacity in his January 6 rally remarks, which were a focus of Swalwell's lawsuit. The Justice Department had previously refused to certify the alleged conduct as within the scope of his official role in a July filing, in which the department said it opposed stepping in as a defendant for Brooks in the case. By dismissing the case against Brooks altogether, the judge avoided resolving that dispute.In his Wednesday order, Mehta echoed the conclusion that he had come to in the previous opinion, issued last month: that the remarks by Brooks at the rally -- as well as the rally speeches by Rudy Giuliani and Donald Trump Jr. also targeted in Swalwell's complaint -- were protected by the First Amendment. \"The allegations against Brooks do not support a plausible inference that 'he was advocating . . . any action' or that 'his words were intended to produce, and likely to produce, imminent disorder,'\" Mehta wrote, referencing a relevant Supreme Court precedent. The judge likewise dismissed against Brooks other claims in Swalwell's lawsuit that had been previously dismissed against Giuliani and Trump Jr.Read MoreMehta has allowed Swalwell's case -- and lawsuits filed by other Democratic lawmakers and by Capitol law enforcement officials -- to move forward against former President Donald Trump, having rejected in the February 18 opinion Trump's motion to dismiss.",

        "content": "(CNN)Four men accused of conspiring to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2020 are heading to trial with opening statements beginning Wednesday.  Adam Fox, Barry Croft, Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta face federal charges of conspiring to kidnap the Democratic governor. Fox, Croft and Harris face additional charges of conspiring to use weapons of mass destruction including explosive devices, according to court documents. Croft and Harris are also charged with possessing destructive devices -- counts added in a second indictment last April.  All have pleaded not guilty.  The case underscores the political tensions in Michigan that reached new heights as Whitmer faced backlash for restrictions she had imposed in 2020 in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Observers have pointed to then-President Donald Trump's rhetoric toward the governor and her state, including a tweet in which he called on residents to \"liberate\" the state from the restrictions.  The presiding judge in the case has said the parties should avoid political discourse about hot-button current events like the 2021 attack at the US Capitol, but the defendants' alleged politically motivated involvement in anti-government activities will likely come out at trial to some extent.  Read MoreThe jury will see the defendants' chat messages and social media communications, photographs and video recordings of group events, and undercover audio recordings of the defendants discussing the plot, according to court documents.  Two FBI agents who infiltrated the defendants' extremist group undercover are expected to testify as well.The alleged co-conspirators, associated with a Michigan-based group called \"Wolverine Watchmen,\" had \"intended to use the destructive devices to facilitate their plot to kidnap the Governor, by harming and hindering the Governor's security detail and any responding law enforcement officers\" at Whitmer's vacation home, the prosecutors said.  Fox allegedly ordered $4,000 worth of explosives from an FBI agent posing as a co-conspirator in September 2020 and Croft and Harris detonated an IED containing shrapnel near human silhouette targets \"to assess its effectiveness as an anti-personnel weapon\" that same day, according to the superseding indictment. The FBI became aware of the scheme in early 2020 through a social media group.  Several other people were charged in the case by the state, in addition to those charged in federal court.   What to expect at trial     Prosecutors have said they plan to call more than 25 witnesses to the stand in the government's case, which could take about three weeks. The entire trial in federal court in Grand Rapids, Michigan, is expected to last about four to five weeks, the attorneys have estimated.   Two men who were previously charged in the case but took a guilty plea deal are expected to testify against their alleged co-conspirators in court.  Ty Garbin and Kaleb Franks each pleaded guilty to one count of kidnapping conspiracy. Garbin was sentenced to six years in prison last year.    At Garbin's sentencing hearing, a federal prosecutor said that \"It's hard to overstate how significant Mr. Garbin's cooperation was here. He didn't hold back. He would come right out and say, 'We planned to do this and I was knowingly a part of it.'\"  Franks, who pleaded guilty about a month before the trial was scheduled to begin, is to be sentenced in June. He confirmed in court during a change of plea hearing that he had not been entrapped by undercover agents or informants who had infiltrated the group.  \"Among other things, they will testify that Fox and Croft initiated the kidnapping plot; that Harris and Caserta voluntarily joined it; and that none of the defendants were entrapped by law enforcement,\" a government court filing says.   At least one paid confidential informant and about a dozen \"civilian witnesses with knowledge of the plot\" are also expected to testify, according to court documents.  Attorneys for the four remaining defendants have indicated they may make an entrapment defense argument for the jury. Fox's attorney alleges his client was drawn in by paid informants, leading him to be caught up in the crimes alleged in the indictment.   Judge Robert Jonker empaneled a jury of 12 plus six alternates Tuesday after nine hours of jury selection.  The jurors, defendants and attorneys will not be required to wear masks during trial proceedings, the judge ruled.",

        "content": "(CNN)DNA evidence taken from a bite mark left on a victim led California detectives to charge a man with murder nearly 28 years after a woman was stabbed to death in her apartment, officials said Tuesday. Sharron Eugene Gadlin, 48, was arrested Friday and charged with first-degree murder in the killing of Cheri Huss on April 24, 1994, according to a news release from the Riverside County District Attorney. \"I hope Cheri and her family will finally get the justice they deserve and have waited so long for,\" District Attorney Mike Hestrin said in a statement.Read More Gadlin remains in custody on a $1 million bail, court records show. CNN reached out to his public defender for comment but has not yet received a response. Brutal killing of a mother and son in 1994 is solved through DNA evidence, police say Huss, 39, was stabbed multiple times and bitten by her killer during the attack in her apartment in Desert Hot Springs, a city about 100 miles east of Los Angeles, according to the news release.  Huss fought her attacker, investigators concluded at the time, which caused the killer to leave blood at the crime scene, the release said. Forensic testing showed DNA from the male attacker's blood matched the DNA of the saliva from bite marks found on Huss, the release said. The Riverside County Regional Cold Case Team last month identified Gadlin as a person of interest after using forensic genetic genealogy and discovering that he lived about 12 miles from Huss' apartment at the time of the killing, the DA's office said. Investigators obtained a saliva sample from Gadlin on February 14, and days later, the state's justice department lab matched Gadlin's DNA to the profile of the suspected killer, the release said.CNN has reached out to the District Attorney's office for further information.Gadlin's next court date is March 25, according to court records.CNN's Taylor Romine contributed to this report.",

Fernandez, who is not one of the CITGO 6, had been detained in the western city of San Cristobal shortly after entering Venezuela from neighboring Colombia. He was accused of terrorism for carrying a small domestic drone, Poleo told CNN. Flying a drone without a license is illegal in Venezuela.The releases follow a high-profile visit by US officials to Caracas on Saturday -- the first since diplomatic relations between the two countries broke down in 2019.Read MorePresident Joe Biden praised the release of the two men in a statement Tuesday night, saying they were \"wrongfully detained\" and will now \"be able to hug their families once more.\"The President said that unjustly holding Americans captive was always unacceptable.\"And even as we celebrate the return of Cardenas and Fernandez, we also remember the names and the stories of every American who is being unjustly held against their will -- in Venezuela, in Russia, in Afghanistan, Syria, China, Iran, and elsewhere around the world. My Administration will keep fighting to bring them all home,\" Biden said.Lawyers and relatives of the CITGO 6 have often accused Venezuelan embattled leader Nicolas Maduro of using the group as \"pawns\" to exert pressure on the US government. In recent months, the men were taken to prison from house arrest in apparent retaliation for the US extradition of Alex Saab, a Colombian financier close to Maduro.The group consists of C\u00e1rdenas, Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Pereira, Jorge Toledo, Jos\u00e9 Luis Zambrano, Tomeu Vadell and Alirio Jos\u00e9 Zambrano. The former executives of CITGO Petroleum Corp. were arrested in 2017 in Caracas on embezzlement charges, which they deny.US National Security Council Senior Director for the Western Hemisphere Juan Gonzalez and US Ambassador James Story met with Maduro and his wife in Caracas to discuss the health of US citizens detained in Venezuela and the state of US sanctions on the Venezuelan oil market, both the US government and the Venezuelan government said on Monday.The current whereabouts of C\u00e1rdenas and Fernandez are unclear, although former prisoners in similar circumstances in the past were allowed to fly to the United States hours after their release.This story has been updated with additional reporting Tuesday.",

        "content": "(CNN)A dual Russian-American citizen has been charged with acting as a spy in the US, according to court filings that say she ran organizations that \"sought to spread Russian propaganda.\" Elena Branson was charged Tuesday with acting and conspiring to act in the US illegally as an agent of the Russian government, willfully failing to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, conspiring to commit visa fraud and making false statements to the FBI, according to a criminal complaint. The complaint alleges that Branson fled to Russia in 2020.From at least 2011, Branson worked on behalf of the Russian government and Russian officials to advance Russian interests in the US, the complaint says. Prosecutors allege she coordinated meetings for Russian officials to lobby US political officials and businesspeople, and operated organizations to publicly promote Russian government policies.US spy chiefs say Putin is likely to escalate in Ukraine with no concern for civilian casualtiesCNN has attempted to contact Branson for comment on the charges.Read MoreThe charges come as tensions between the US and Russia continue to intensify following Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine last month, with the US front-and-center in a multinational effort to punish Russia for its actions. Among the allegations, prosecutors say Branson exchanged a series of emails in March 2016 with a Russian minister, who asked her to organize a meeting with Donald Trump, who was then a Republican presidential candidate, or his daughter, in New York. The complaint says Branson sent the minister a draft letter to the now-former President inviting him to the Russia Forum New York in April 2016, but there is no indication that Trump or his children attended the meeting.CNN has reached out to representatives of Trump for comment.Prosecutors allege Branson ran an organization in New York City called the Russian Center New York, which allegedly received \"tens of thousands of dollars in funding from the Russian government and have taken direct orders from Russian officials concerning events and public messaging,\" according to the complaint. US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams said that Branson is alleged to have corresponded with Russian Vladimir Putin, and met with a high-ranking Russian minister before founding a \"propaganda center\" in New York City.\"Branson's promotional outreach, including an 'I Love Russia' campaign aimed at American youths, exemplifies her attempts to act at the behest of the Russian government to illegally promote its interests in the United States,\" Williams said in a statement. \"Particularly given current global events, the need to detect and hinder attempts at foreign influence is of critical importance, and the Southern District of New York is proud to do its part in the fight against tyranny,\" he added. Prosecutors said the FBI interviewed Branson in September 2020 and that she falsely claimed she'd never been asked by Russian officials to coordinate meetings between US business leaders or politicians and Russian government officials.  The organization's offices were searched by the FBI in 2020, and prosecutors allege Branson flew to Moscow about a month after the search.In 2021, prosecutors said, Branson did an interview with Russian state-controlled network Russia Today, where she said she left the US because she was \"scared\" and thought it was likely that she'd be arrested if she stayed in the country.",

Russian authorities said Griner had cannabis oil in her luggage and accused her of smuggling significant amounts of a narcotic substance -- an offense punishable by up to 10 years in prison. It's still not clear exactly when Griner was arrested last month, or where she's being detained now. But escalating tensions between the US and Russia over Russia's invasion of Ukraine has stoked concerns that getting Griner out of Russia will be \"very difficult.\" 'She's been there for quite some time'Read MoreAdaora Elonu, a former WBNA player who has also played in Russia, said she was \"extremely worried\" about Griner. The state-owned Russia 24 channel said this photo of Brittney Griner was taken at a police station.\"Right now, I'm just very, very concerned -- also knowing that she's been there for quite some time,\" Elonu told CNN on Tuesday. She described feeling detached from much of the world while living in Russia. \"Being in Russia, I was kind of in a bubble,\" Elonu said. \"I didn't feel unsafe. I felt as if there was not much happening in that country. I know there was a lot going on outside of the country. But as far as when I was in Russia, we weren't getting much news about what was happening. Aside from my family and friends and my agent, they were letting me know about what was happening. But it was hard to balance what was actually happening and what I felt,\" she said. \"But once things started escalating, my agent was definitely pushing for me to get out. And I'm glad I listened to his advice and got out.\" 'There are no words to express this pain'Griner's whereabouts aren't publicly known. CNN has reached out to the Russian Foreign Ministry for comment but has not heard back. It'll be 'very difficult' to get detained US basketball star Brittney Griner out of Russia, lawmaker saysA member of Russia's Federal Customs Service described the charge against Griner to Russia 24, the country's main state-owned news channel. \"A criminal case has been opened against an American citizen under section 2 of 229 YK RF (Russian law) for smuggling of a significant amount of drugs,\" Irina Begisheva of the Main Directorate for the Fight Against Smuggling of the Federal Customs Service told Russia 24.In an Instagram post, Griner's wife described the agony of waiting. \"People say 'stay busy.' Yet, there's not a task in this world that could keep any of us from worrying about you. My heart, our hearts, are all skipping beats everyday that goes by.\" Cherelle Griner posted Monday. \"There are no words to express this pain. I'm hurting, we're hurting.\"Over the weekend, she thanked supporters and asked for privacy \"as we continue to work on getting my wife home safely.\"What we know (and don't know) about the arrest of Brittney GrinerBut a member of the US House Armed Services Committee said \"it's going to be very difficult\" to get Griner out of Russia. \"Our diplomatic relationships with Russia are nonexistent at the moment,\" Democratic Rep. John Garamendi of California told CNN on Monday. \"Perhaps during the various negotiations that may take place, she might be able to be one of the solutions. I don't know.\"He also noted that \"Russia has some very, very strict LGBT rules and laws\" -- though it's not clear whether those rules and laws might impact Griner's case. Russia has passed LGBTQ-related legislation and outlawed the \"propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors.\"Griner's high school basketball coach, Debbie Jackson, said she worries Griner's case will be used for political purposes.\"My biggest fear is that ... she will become a political pawn,\" Jackson told CNN.But the Biden administration is working on trying to get Griner out of Russia, members of the Congressional Black Caucus said after meeting with President Joe Biden on Monday. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, who represents Griner's hometown of Houston, said she raised the issue of Griner's detainment and the \"need for her to be immediately released and for her to receive the help of the United States to demand and facilitate that release,\" in that meeting with the President, according to a statement Tuesday.A storied careerGriner has spent her entire WNBA career with the Phoenix Mercury and won the league's championship in 2014. The WNBA has confirmed that all other league players have departed Russia and Ukraine.Like many other WNBA players, Griner plays overseas in the offseason where salaries can be much higher than what female professional basketball players are paid in the US.She won the EuroLeague Women championship last year with Russian club UMMC Ekaterinburg, where she has played since 2015 during her offseasons. Fans around the world have called for Griner's release, with more than 34,000 people signing the \"Secure Brittney Griner's Swift and Safe Return to the U.S.\" petition on Change.org as of Tuesday.CNN's Lucy Kafanov, Wayne Sterling, Rosa Flores, Lisa France, Chris Boyette and Chenelle Woody contributed to this report.",

Gunshots were fired by multiple shooters from multiple vehicles, police said.A 15-year-old boy who did not attend the school was killed, and police said he was the intended target of the shooting. Two female students also were shot and remain hospitalized -- a 16-year-old in serious condition and an 18-year-old in critical condition, according to police.The incident is at least the 13th shooting at an American campus with K-12 students in 2022, according to a CNN tally.After the shooting, Des Moines police detectives carried out five residential search warrants and six vehicle search warrants and recovered six firearms, police said in a news release. Six Des Moines residents between the ages of 14 and 17 have been charged with one count of murder and two counts of attempted murder, according to police.Read MorePolice said they started receiving multiple calls reporting gunfire at the school at 2:48 p.m. and found the three victims outside when they arrived. All three were rushed to hospitals.\"While this incident occurred outside of a school, it could have occurred in any one of our neighborhoods,\" Des Moines police said on Facebook. \"The school is where the suspects found their target. The rapid response by DMPD officers, and the swift action by the school staff placing the building in lockdown and sheltering students and staff in place, certainly had a positive impact on safety and scene management.\"East High School Student Kaylie Shannon told CNN affiliate KCCI that she was in a car outside the school when she heard shots.\"I was just sitting in my friend's car and then all of the sudden I heard 11 gunshots and some boys screaming,\" Shannon said.The school went under lockdown for more than 40 minutes, but students were dismissed around 3:30 p.m. when police gave an all clear, according to a statement from Des Moines Public Schools.Sgt. Paul Parizek called the incident \"a punch in the gut,\" KCCI reported. \"The kids in that school are our community's most precious cargo,\" he said.Shooting is 'everyone's worst nightmare'East High School was closed Tuesday, the statement from Des Moines Public Schools said.\"The DMPS grief team will be available at East High for students and staff beginning tomorrow through the remainder of the week. School counselors will be available at our other schools for students who need additional support,\" the district said in a news release.1 teen is dead and 2 are in critical condition after shooting\"I think we can all agree an event like this is everyone's worst nightmare. Tonight, hug your students and love them,\" Principal Jill Versteeg said in the statement.Shootings in and near schools have become too common, Superintendent Thomas Ahart said. \"Our staff and students are forced to train for these incidents and the trauma associated with the repeated drills and incidents will remain with them for years to come. It's unfortunate that our state and our country have become a place where firearms are far too easily accessible. We remain committed to protecting our students and staff, but real change to gun laws and access would go a long way to help us,\" Ahart said in the statement.The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) of Kansas City went to the scene to assist in the investigation, the agency tweeted.

        "content": "(CNN)A California woman's abduction claim, which federal prosecutors allege was false, cost the public hundreds of thousands of dollars, according to statements from authorities and court documents. Sherri Papini vanished in November 2016, launching a massive search, only for the Northern California mother of two to turn up three weeks later, telling investigators she'd been kidnapped, beaten and branded. California woman accused of hoax kidnapping was driven by 'narcissistic behavior,' sheriff saysThe Justice Department says Papini made the whole thing up. She was arrested last Thursday and has been charged with making false statements to a law enforcement officer and mail fraud, the department said in a news release. Papini, who had been detained since her arrest, appeared before a judge via Zoom on Tuesday. US Magistrate Judge Jeremy Peterson ruled she could be released on an $120,000 bond, with certain conditions, including that her travel be limited to only one part of California, that she must receive psychiatric treatment, must surrender her passport and cannot use firearms, among other terms. Read MoreThe judge addressed Papini directly, warning her that if she violated those conditions, there would be further penalties.Assistant US Attorney Veronica Alegria argued against Papini's release, claiming Papini is an \"extreme flight risk\" and has a \"lengthy pattern of dishonesty.\"Papini's alleged fraudulent disappearance was not without consequences to others: It cost upward of $230,000 and \"countless hours\" of manpower, according to officials.\"Ultimately, the investigation revealed that there was no kidnapping,\" US Attorney Phillip A. Talbert said in the DOJ news release, \"and that time and resources that could have been used to investigate actual crime, protect the community, and provide resources to victims were wasted based on the defendant's conduct.\"CNN has reached out multiples times to Michael Borges, an attorney for Papini, for comment. During Tuesday's virtual court appearance, Borges said his client has no intention to flee while she awaits trial.  Sheriff: Investigation took resources from real casesPapini's husband reported her missing November 2, 2016, after she failed to pick up her kids at day care. She was found three weeks later, alone on Interstate 5 about 140 miles from home. She told police she had been kidnapped by two women who wore masks and spoke Spanish. They held her at gunpoint, she said, kept her chained in a closet and branded her. But last week, the Justice Department said Papini was actually with an ex-boyfriend in Southern California and that she caused her own injuries in support of her abduction claim. In all, the cost of the investigation borne by public safety agencies was around $150,000 -- a conservative estimate, Shasta County Sheriff Michael Johnson said in a statement on Facebook last week. But the cost isn't only measured in dollars, Johnson said. Papini's case and her story diverted resources from real cases with real victims.Years ago, she told police she had been abducted, beaten and branded. Now she's charged with making it all up\"Not only did this charade take valuable resources away from real criminal investigative matters,\" the sheriff said, \"but in a time where there is serious human trafficking cases with legitimate victims Sherri Papini used this tragic societal phenomenon to gain notoriety and financial gain.\"  \"Finally,\" he added, \"all of law enforcement in Shasta (County) was put on a national stage and subjected to scrutiny and criticism for the handling (of) this case.\" Papini's case cost the public in other ways, too.According to an affidavit in support of the criminal complaint, between 2017 and 2021, Papini received $30,000 from the California Victim Compensation Board, which assists and reimburses victims of violent crimes for \"crime-related expenses\" they suffer. In Papini's case, the affidavit says, $1,000 was used so Papini could buy blinds for her home and nearly $2,000 were paid to the ambulance provider who transported Papini after she was found. The rest of the money were payments for Papini's therapy and treatment for anxiety and post-traumatic stress stemming from her supposed kidnapping. Then, there was the GoFundMe campaign that allegedly netted just over $49,000. Per the affidavit, donors were told the funds would be used to \"find and bring Sherri home.\" In fact, federal prosecutors say, more than $30,000 was withdrawn by a family member from the campaign's bank account and more than $11,000 was used to pay off the family's personal credit cards.The remaining amount was \"spent on personal expenses,\" the affidavit says.A GoFundMe spokesperson told CNN the fundraiser has been removed from the platform and has not been actively receiving donations since 2016. \"We are working with law enforcement to assist with their ongoing investigation,\" the spokesperson said.Regarding the GoFundMe campaign, family spokesman Chris Thomas referred questions to Borges, the attorney for Papini.Last week, Thomas criticized Papini's arrest, which the spokesperson said happened in front of her children. \"If requested, Sherri would have fully complied and come to the police station,\" he said, \"as she has done multiple times before, where this could have been handled in a more appropriate way.\"Papini and her husband \"cooperated\" with law enforcement, Thomas said, adding, \"We are confused by several aspects of the charges and hope to get clarification in the coming days.\"CNN's Taylor Romine contributed to this report.",

We are obviously very pleased with the outcome,\" Giuffre attorney David Boies told CNN. Boies would not disclose the amount the two parties agreed upon.CNN reached out to counsel for Prince Andrew for comment.After the payment was made, attorneys for both parties filed a stipulation for the lawsuit to be dismissed with prejudice, meaning Giuffre cannot refile the claim in the same district court in New York. Read MoreThe settlement brings to a close a civil lawsuit that sprung from the sprawling and disturbing allegations against Jeffrey Epstein, the wealthy sex offender who befriended a series of powerful men despite a sketchy history.In the lawsuit, Giuffre alleged Epstein trafficked her and forced her to have sex with his friends, including Prince Andrew, and that Andrew was aware she was underage in the US at the time. She alleged Andrew sexually abused her at Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands, at his mansion in Manhattan and at his former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell's home in London.Prince Andrew and Virginia Giuffre agree to settle sex abuse lawsuitThe prince has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. Still, the allegations against Andrew, 62, dramatically tarnished his public standing, and he stepped back from royal duties in late 2019.In January, US District Judge Lewis Kaplan denied Andrew's motion to dismiss the lawsuit, and he had been scheduled to give a statement under oath on March 10, a source told CNN.However, the parties reached an out-of-court settlement agreement last month. The settlement included Prince Andrew's payment of an undisclosed amount to Giuffre and to her charity supporting victims' rights, according to court documents.\"Prince Andrew intends to make a substantial donation to Ms. Giuffre's charity in support of victims' rights. Prince Andrew has never intended to malign Ms. Giuffre's character, and he accepts that she has suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks,\" according to a letter filed to the court last month announcing the settlement.Epstein was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges in July 2019 as prosecutors accused him of carrying out a decades long scheme of sexual abuse of underage girls. He died by suicide in jail before he could face trial.Maxwell was arrested in 2020 and accused of facilitating the abuse scheme. A federal jury convicted her in December on five federal counts, including sex trafficking a minor and conspiracy. However, that conviction could be upended as the court weighs concerns about a juror's false statements on his questionnaire.CNN's Eric Levenson and Brian Vitagliano contributed to this report.",

Bragg said the case is still active, but the resignations and grand jury point make clear that the case is all but closed. Did he puff up the value of his properties, or not? The question seems painfully straightforward. It's not. I have been a lawyer for nearly 20 years, with part of that time as a federal prosecutor. I have found that one of the most confounding concepts to explain to others is \"criminal intent\": the defendant's mental state that prosecutors must establish to convict him. Cases rise and fall on whether prosecutors can prove intent, which varies from crime to crime.  Here, prosecutors would have had to prove not just that he inflated the value of his assets, but that he intended to break the law by doing so. It is a subtle but profound distinction, and one in which the clich\u00e9 \"ignorance of the law is no excuse\" doesn't apply cleanly.  Gumming things up is the fact that property valuation is inherently subjective. For instance, the fact that I might genuinely believe that my home is worth $50 million dollars (for the record, it is not) would complicate prosecutors' ability to prosecute me for conveying that belief to a lender.These court rulings are a major blow to Trump and his family Financial fraud cases are most easily proven on the strength of electronic documents linking the defendant to misconduct. However, Trump is notorious for using computers and email infrequently. Here, there wasn't likely to be a smoking-gun email or document pulled from the defendant's hard drive or cell phone. This fact might not be fatal, if other evidence, particularly from witnesses, could have helped establish his state of mind. But who would testify against him? Trump is famously surrounded by loyal senior staff. For instance, Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization's longtime finance chief facing criminal tax charges, might have been a promising candidate to testify, but he resisted pressure from prosecutors to do so. (Weisselberg maintains his innocence.) And, thus far, it doesn't appear that prosecutors can get solid on-the-record testimony from anyone else in the inner circle. Which brings us to the possible testimony of Trump's former self-described \"fixer,\" Michael Cohen. Despite Cohen having already testified under oath before Congress about Trump's assets, he would have been a disaster on the witness stand. He has pleaded guilty to nine criminal offenses, including lying to Congress, tax fraud and campaign finance violations for helping pay off two women following alleged affairs with Trump. (Trump denies the affairs.) Cohen would have faced questions of personal bias, given his own multiple lawsuits against Trump and his associates. He would have faced questions about whether he received a benefit from prosecutors for testifying. Trump wouldn't have needed a skilled defense attorney; a middle schooler with basic mock trial training could have eviscerated Cohen's credibility on the stand, likely dooming the prosecutors' case.JUST WATCHEDGeorgia DA on how she's going up against Trump for election interferenceReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHGeorgia DA on how she's going up against Trump for election interference 03:22Criminal cases do not materialize from the ether; prosecutors must be able to prove their facts to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. It would be irresponsible, and perhaps unethical, for lawyers to proceed with a prosecution they weren't confident they could win. Put another way, the fact that something might be true doesn't mean that even the best prosecutors will be able to establish it in court. That truth is not comforting to people who are frustrated by the fact that nothing seems to stick to Trump. They are onto something; it cannot be coincidental when the same individual or organizations with his name on them face, at once, a civil investigation regarding property valuation from the New York attorney general; separate criminal investigations from the Fulton County, Georgia, and Westchester County, New York, district attorneys and the Washington, DC, attorney general; civil suits alleging election misconduct in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, and Michigan; a defamation suit by a voting machine company; congressional investigations into his tax returns, conflicts of interest, the lease of his Washington, DC, hotel and potential mishandling of government documents; civil suits from multiple police officers who were injured on January 6; an allegation from the January 6 House Select Committee that he was part of a criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States; a defamation suit from someone who has accused him of sexual assault; and a suit from his niece alleging fraud around her inheritance. And those were just the ones I could remember. (Trump, the Trump Organization and his campaign deny wrongdoing in all.) Those who are frustrated are right to be upset.  Tempting as it may be to conflate every allegation against the former President, most have little to do with each other beyond their least common denominator -- the name at the center of them. Get our free weekly newsletterSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook And accountability may not always come through the criminal justice system. For instance, civil suits have a lower burden of proof than criminal cases. Trump could face serious civil liability in some of the places the criminal justice system can't reach. More importantly, allegations -- particularly ones judges have reviewed and allowed to stand -- carry some weight outside the courtroom. The dizzying number of them help demonstrate that the former President was manifestly unfit to serve when in office. He should never hold elective office again. Congress, led by the overwhelming majority of Senate Republicans, failed the American public and history, twice, by not barring him from future office following his impeachment trials. If the raft of claims isn't enough to convince the electorate to stop rewarding this unfit individual with high office, nothing will. That continued failure, which started with his first election in 2016, is on the American people -- not the Manhattan district attorney.",

Outlaw said the officer will be suspended for 30 days and at the end of that period will be fired. She did not go into details about what action the officer took that violated the department policy.The officer who is being terminated is one of four officers riding in an unmarked police car when the rear window was struck by a bullet, police said. The officer and another officer chased Siderio and a 17-year-old. The officer fired his service weapon, striking Siderio in the back.Thomas Siderio In a statement, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner said his office is investigating the incident along with the police department, as is standard practice. Without going into further detail, Krasner said the death is \"a factually complex and deeply troubling one based on preliminary investigative information.\"  Read MoreThe union that represents the police officer declined to comment.Outlaw did not name the officers involved, citing security threats, instead referring to them as Officers number one, two, three and four. \"I've made the decision to utilize Commissioner's Direct Action to suspend Officer number one with the intent to dismiss the officer at the end of 30 days due to violations of our use of force directive,\" the commissioner said in a Tuesday news conference. \"Due to our use of force directive, or the collective bargaining agreement between the city and the FOP (Fraternal Order of Police), the soonest I can serve this action will be 72 hours after communicating my intent to the FOP. So therefore, the soonest the 30 days can begin, is this Friday afternoon.\"Based off of the evidence that I reviewed, it was clear that the use of force policy was violated,\" Outlaw said. \"I will tell you that all use of force has to be proportionate to the resistance they're trying to overcome. I will also tell you that our policy clearly states that excessive force will not be tolerated.\"Philadelphia police shoot and kill 12-year-old after a shot was fired into officers' carOutlaw said evidence collected so far indicates it was Thomas Siderio who discharged the firearm into the police vehicle. Siderio was still in possession of the firearm as he fled on foot, according to Outlaw. Officer number two maintained cover as Officer number one continued to pursue Siderio on foot and discharged two additional times, striking Siderio in the upper right back, one time, the bullet exiting from the left chest area, the commissioner said.Outlaw said police are also certain it was Officer number one who fired the shot that struck and killed Thomas Siderio.\"It's just it's just a sickening and saddening situation all around,\" the commissioner added. \"By the grace of God our officers were not shot and killed or not shot in the head. So, there's a miracle there. It's tragic that a 12-year-old had access to a gun. It's tragic that we have trigger pullers as young as 12. It's tragic the circumstances that even lead our young people out there in the first place. And it's tragic that we had one of our own again, go against everything who we say we are.\"Conor Corcoran, the Siderio family attorney, accused the police commissioner of \"utterly refusing to provide any details about what she knows.\" Corcoran has also filed an intent to file a lawsuit.The DA investigation will determine if any criminal law was violated, while the police department will determine if there are department violations.",

        "content": "(CNN)The Cincinnati Police Department implemented a new policy limiting police chases to \"violent felony offenses,\" the latest city to restrict the risky police tactic. The Atlanta Police Department updated its policy last summer, similarly limiting police to pursuits in cases where violence is suspected. Chicago police are forbidden from chasing for traffic or theft offenses and required to balance the police action against the risk to the public. The policy in Volusia County, Florida, updated last January, states that apprehending a suspect is \"never more important than the safety of innocent motorists or (deputies).\" Controversial Police Encounters Fast FactsLike many tactics that came into vogue in the 1980s and 1990s as police departments across the country led the \"war on drugs,\" police chases have fallen out of favor among police leadership and the mayors and city councils that oversee them. \"I started looking at this in 1980 and it was 'chase until the wheels fall off.' It's not that now,\" said Geoffrey P. Alpert, a professor of criminology at the University of South Carolina. \"For the first time, national statistics show more departments have restrictive policies than judgmental policies. We're seeing more and more departments are restricting (pursuits).\" Chases are frequently deadly. A woman and her baby, both passengers, were killed when the driver they were with crashed into a semitrailer while fleeing police in January. The driver was charged with carrying a gun, but the stop started because of a suspected red light violation. In New Mexico, a police officer and a bystander were killed as police chased a suspected kidnapper.Read MoreSuch accidents have cost millions of dollarsAccording to data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 532 people (including three \"occupants of a police vehicle\") died in police pursuits in 2020. At least one, and as many as 10, occupants of police vehicles have died during pursuits each year since the mid 1980s.More than 5,000 bystanders and passengers were killed in car chases between 1979 and 2013, according to one study. A study of data published in 2007 estimated that 323 people died in police pursuits between 1982 and 2004. Police engaged in about 68,000 pursuits in the year 2012, according to one study, which estimated about 355 people died each year in police pursuits.  Regardless of how serious the underlying crime may be, experts say that any police pursuit brings risk to police, suspects, and the public. Aside from a backlash to all manner of aggressive policing that followed unrest in 2020 over the murder of George Floyd, municipalities have paid out large sums of money in lawsuits resulting from police chases. Philadelphia police shoot and kill 12-year-old after a shot was fired into officers' carThe city of Portsmouth, Virginia, settled a lawsuit this this week for $11 million after a police pursuit resulted in a death. In Chicago, the city agreed to a $1.4 million settlement for a woman whose toddler was hit by a car fleeing police in 2015. A judge in Alabama issued a $3.2 million verdict against the city of Birmingham in connection with a police chase in 2020. Cincinnati's policy, enacted at the end of February, requires officers to balance the risk of the chase against the risk created by a fleeing suspect's escape. It permits chases when an officer is trying to catch a suspect in a \"violent felony\" or when an officer sees something that \"constitutes a risk of serious physical harm\" to officers or the public. Officials from the Cincinnati Police Department and Cincinnati Mayor's Office both declined to comment. \"My line is violent crime. It's reasonable to start a pursuit. It doesn't mean continue,\" Alpert said. \"An example is if it's running through school zones, when bars close at 2 a.m. and you know a lot of people are out. Yeah, if it's violent it justifies starting (a pursuit), it doesn't mean always continue.\"Michael Chitwood, sheriff of Volusia County, said deputies have to consider the risk of chases, the totality of circumstances, and what other ways there are to achieve the goal of taking someone into custody. That could include closing down highway entrance ramps to lessen the risk of traffic and crashes miles ahead, or it could mean giving up on a chase once there's a helicopter overhead that can follow the wanted car. \"You see if you can manage it,\" he said. \"If you can't manage it, there's no disgrace in saying, 'I just can't do this, let it go.' \" \"Good policing is using tools in a responsible, accountable, legally accepted manner,\" Chitwood said. \"Aggressive policing is, (doing something) because you can. State law allows for almost anything ... but cities and counties are more restrictive than state laws, because we have to live with the repercussions.\" 'In too many cases, the costs are too high'Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, said that pursuit driving is one of the riskiest actions any police officer can take. The risks are great to officers and suspects, but also to uninvolved pedestrians or motorists. \"There's still departments that have people chasing people for shoplifting, for larceny, chasing because they didn't stop. Just chasing them. In 2022 we know the consequences of a chase that goes out of control is astronomical,\" Wexler said. \"There are people who've died needlessly because departments don't have guidelines or really strict guidelines.\"These are the faces of the new generation of police officers in AmericaEven pursuits for violent crimes should have controls built in, Wexler said, like rules for supervision and for when officers should end chases. \"You just have to ask a basic question: Do the benefits of risk outweigh the costs? That's what it comes down to. In too many cases, the costs are too high,\" Wexler said. Alpert said he favored an approach like Cincinnati's, where the policy sets out a clear line for what officers are allowed to initiate pursuits for, and what they're not. \"When you have a judgmental policy, you're putting cops in unreasonable situations. You're making them go through a whole variety of factors in a short period of time and to make a decision,\" Alpert said. \"My opinion is (that) the chief should make a decision for them. There are certain crimes for which pursuits are justified, certain crimes for which they aren't ... Cops would rather be told what to do than put in a bad situation, make bad decisions and be second guessed by the department.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the far-right Proud Boys, has been charged with conspiracy in the US Capitol attack on January 6, 2021, the Justice Department announced on Tuesday.The superseding indictment unveiled Tuesday includes several other members of the Proud Boys who are already facing charges for actions relating to January 6. It also reveals that Tarrio allegedly met with Oath Keeper leader Stewart Rhodes in a Washington, DC, parking garage leading up to the riot.Tarrio and Rhodes met for approximately 30 minutes, according to the indictment, and at least one participant \"referenced the Capitol.\" Tarrio then traveled to Baltimore, according to the indictment, and he was not in the District during the Capitol riot.According to the Justice Department Tuesday, \"Tarrio and his co-defendants...conspired to corruptly obstruct, influence, and impede an official proceeding, the certification of the Electoral College vote.\"   \"On Jan. 6, the defendants directed, mobilized, and led members of the crowd onto the Capitol grounds and into the Capitol, leading to dismantling of metal barricades, destruction of property, and assaults on law enforcement,\" the Justice Department said in a statement.Read MoreTarrio appeared in court Tuesday afternoon in Florida and will remain in jail until a detention hearing Friday. The Justice Department has asked that he be detained pending trial, saying he is a flight risk and a threat to the community.Shackled and wearing shorts and a T-shirt, Tarrio said he has just gotten a job printing T-shirts, that he doesn't own a car and has no savings when the judge asked him about his finances.The indictment marks a newly aggressive step in a conspiracy case against Proud Boys leadership that had appeared to stagnate in recent months in federal court. The new set of charges adding Tarrio come shortly after prosecutors expanded their January 6 case into another right-wing extremist group, the Oath Keepers, whose leaders are accused of seditious conspiracy for actions they took on January 6 and leading up to Joe Biden's inauguration.The developments with the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers now put both groups' top people under arrest.Tarrio previously served a jail sentence in DC for burning a church's Black Lives Matter banner in December 2020, and for bringing high-capacity rifle magazines to Washington, DC. That conduct occurred days before the attack on the Capitol.JUST WATCHEDProud Boys leader: I'll celebrate the moment government fears the peopleReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHProud Boys leader: I'll celebrate the moment government fears the people 08:31According to the new court filings, Tarrio did not immediately comply with an order issued after his January 4, 2020 arrest in the flag-burning case that he leave DC upon his January 5 release.Tarrio is charged in the indictment with five other Proud Boys leaders.The other defendants are Ethan Nordean, the \"sergeant at arms\" of the Proud Boys and president of his local chapter; Joseph Biggs, a self-described organizer of Proud Boys events; Zachary Rehl, who runs the Philadelphia chapter of the Proud Boys; Charles Donohoe, the president of a local Proud Boys chapter in North Carolina; and Dominic Pezzola, a New York Proud Boy who goes by \"Spaz.\"Rehl, Donohoe, Biggs and Nordean were initially charged together with conspiracy and other charges relating to the attack on the Capitol in March of last year.The conspiracy that the prosecutors allege included the use of social media and other means to raise fund to support travel and \"equipment purchases\" for the trip to DC. The indictment pointed to plans by the Proud Boys to dress \"incognito\" on January 6, as well as their efforts to allegedly obtain gear and supplies. They used encrypted messages in the lead up to plan for the attack, the indictment said, as well as handheld radios to \"coordinate\" the breach. They're accused of carrying out the conspiracy by directing and mobilizing the crowd into the Capitol grounds, by dismantling and storming past its barricades, by destroying property and assaulting law enforcement.\"The purpose of the conspiracy was to stop, delay, and hinder the Certification of the Electoral College vote,\" the indictment said.'I'm not playing games'After the plans for the rally were publicly announced, Tarrio allegedly discussed in a messaging group with several of his co-defendants and others plans for a \"national rally planning committee.\"By late December, according to the filings, Tarrio and a handful of his associates had created the new Proud Boys chapter, referred to as \"Ministry of Self Defense (or \"MOSD'); its leadership was divided into three branches -- operational, marketing and a second tier of eight regional leaders.  It messages, they allegedly discussed raising funds online for \"protective gear and communications\" to be used on January 6, and other logistics around the day -- including plans to abandon the usual Black and Yellow worn by the Proud Boys.On December 30, a person not identified in the indictment allegedly messaged Tarrio a nine-page document entitled \"1776 returns.\" it set forth a plan to occupy a few \"crucial buildings\" in DC, including House and Senate office buildings around the Capitol, with as \"many people as possible\" to \"show our politicians We the People are in Charge.\"The person said that revolution was \"more important than anything,\" according to the indictment, to which Tarrio said, \"That's what every waking moment consists of... I'm not playing games.\"The same night, Rehl allegedly warned prospective members that had been convened on a video call that January 6 would be a \"completely different operation,\" the indictment said.The discussions continued in the following days. Someone identified in the indictment as \"Person-3\" allegedly posted a voice note in the messaging group that said \"main operating theater...should be out in front of the Capitol building. That's where the vote is taking place and all of the objection.\"After Tarrio's arrest in the flag-burning case, Donohue created a new group chat without Tarrio initially and informed the group that it was \"nuking\" the previous messaging chain, according to the indictment.The night before the attack, Tarrio was allegedly added back into the messaging group, and the indictment also highlights public social media posts published by Tarrio on January 6 cheering on the breach.Just before 1 p.m. that day, according to the indictment, Biggs spoke to an unidentified individual who, a minute later, crossed the barrier that was first to be breach in the attack, according to the indictment. It was also the access point for Biggs and others named in the indictment.Tarrio, according to the filings, was also trying to communicate directly to Nordean and Biggs as they were moving in and out of the Capitol. The indictment describes photos and video the defendants took allegedly capturing their participation in the breach.The high profile face of the Proud Boys groupTarrio, as chairman of the Proud Boys, has been its highest profile face since he became close to Trump adviser Roger Stone and he's continued to speak about the national right-wing group.In the plea deal Tarrio reached with the government in the flag burning case, the agreement included a carveout for the potential of federal charges being brought related to the January 6 insurrection.Tarrio has led the far-right extremist organization since 2018.Prosecutors previously accused the group of reorganizing their leadership for the attack after Tarrio left the city. Prosecutors have said in court they believed the Proud Boys wanted another member of the group already charged with conspiracy, Nordean, to assume \"war powers\" in Tarrio's absence. Tarrio's five co-defendants have all pleaded not guilty to January 6-related charges.Outside of criminal court, the Proud Boys and Tarrio have been accused in civil complaints of conspiracy -- alongside Donald Trump -- related to January 6. A federal judge overseeing the civil case in Washington, DC, recently allowed Democratic members of Congress and the Capitol police to move forward with their accusations, after finding it plausible Tarrio coordinated with others.When asked at a presidential debate in 2020 about the Proud Boys, Trump responded the group should \"stand back, and stand by.\" To that, Tarrio tweeted a response: \"Standing by sir.\"The flag-burning case played out in DC local court. It concerned a flag was burned at Asbury United Methodist Church, a historically Black church, on December 12, after Tarrio and other Proud Boys attended a pro-Trump rally in Washington that preceded violent clashes. When Tarrio was arrested upon his returned to DC on January 4, he was found with two high-capacity magazines that are banned under DC's strict gun control laws.He was previously released from jail in January.This story has been updated with additional information.",

The United States has been leasing the 45 square miles that the base sits on since 1903. The base shares a 17-mile fenced border with Cuba. The lease can only be terminated by mutual agreement. Read MoreDetention FacilitiesIn response to the 9/11 attacks in 2001, and subsequent military operations in Afghanistan, existing migrant detention facilities at Guant\u00e1namo were repurposed to hold detainees in the \"war on terror.\" During the administration of President George W. Bush (2001-2009), the United States claimed that Guant\u00e1namo Bay detainees were not on US soil and therefore not covered by the US Constitution, and that \"enemy combatant\" status meant they could be denied some legal protections.There are 38 detainees at Guant\u00e1namo Bay.More than 700 detainees have been held at Guant\u00e1namo since it opened. Peak population was 684 detainees in June 2003. According to Human Rights First, 500 detainees were transferred or released during the Bush Administration and 197 detainees were transferred or released during the Obama Administration.At least nine detainees have died in custody.The US Defense Department spent about $445 million to run Guant\u00e1namo Bay in 2015, down from $522.2 million in 2010.  Timeline1903 - The new Republic of Cuba leases 45 square miles of land in Guant\u00e1namo Bay to the United States for construction of a naval station. Building on the naval station begins that same year.1934 - Cuba and the United States sign a perpetual lease that rents the 45 square miles of Cuba to the United States for $4,085 a year. 1991 - Approximately 34,000 Haitian refugees are detained on the base after they flee a coup in Haiti. 1994-1995 - More than 55,000 Cubans and Haitians captured at sea are kept at Guant\u00e1namo.January 11, 2002 - The first detainees from Afghanistan and Pakistan arrive at the temporary facility of Camp X-Ray.June 28, 2004 - A divided US Supreme Court rules that the Guant\u00e1namo detainees have some rights but leaves open how these rights will be exercised.January 18, 2005 - The Supreme Court refuses to consider whether the government's plan for military trials unfairly denies the detainees basic legal rights.July 13, 2005 - A report presented to the Senate Armed Services details the interrogation of the suspected \"20th hijacker\" in the 9/11 attacks, Mohamed al-Khatani. He was forced to wear a bra, dance with a man and do dog tricks while tied to a leash. Military investigators said that was not considered prohibited, inhumane treatment.April 19, 2006 - Following a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by the Associated Press, the Pentagon releases the most detailed and extensive list of detainees ever provided.

Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who's representing the family of the Black teenager, said in a recent statement that the incident pulled into focus \"the kind of racial bias that we need to root out of our system of policing.\"But it's not only the country's policing system that fails to recognize the humanity of Black boys. The impulse in the US to treat them not as children but as brutes, as villains, extends far beyond law enforcement.The New Jersey incident occurred just as many prepare to observe the 10-year anniversary of the death of Trayvon Martin, the Black 17-year-old whom George Zimmerman gunned down on February 26, 2012. Read MoreOn the night of the shooting, Zimmerman, who was a neighborhood watch captain in Sanford, Florida, called 911 on Martin. Zimmerman described the teenager using a label that's long been tagged to Black boys: suspicious. Disregarding police orders not to engage, Zimmerman confronted the teenager. An altercation broke out; Martin was shot dead.Zimmerman claimed that he acted in self-defense, and he was eventually acquitted. The case illustrated in heartrending fashion a long US history of weaponizing the principle of self-defense against Black men and boys and, more to the point, portraying them as unpredictable aggressors whose every move must be controlled.A history of dehumanizationTo understand this genealogy, let's rewind to the second half of the 19th century.Many White Americans responded to the emancipation of Black Americans in 1863 by stoking the anxiety that Black men \"would exact sexual revenge against White men through their daughters,\" per the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC).The NMAAHC further notes that this fearmongering had horrific repercussions for Black communities, because bolstering stereotypes of Black men as \"animalistic and brutish gave legal authority to White mobs and militias who tortured and killed Black men for the safety of the public.\"It's worth emphasizing that these anti-Black narratives and their effects weren't limited to the American South; as the NMAAHC says, \"headlines of newspapers across the nation, beginning around the turn of the century, document a frenzy of arrests, attempted lynchings and murders of 'Black brutes' accused of insulting or assaulting White women.\"While many of these sensationalist news stories focused on Black men, Black boys weren't spared from dehumanizing stereotypes, either.\"Through brain measurements, doctors and anthropologists set out to prove that Black children's frontal lobes closed up during adolescence,\" Stacey Patton, an associate professor of journalism at Howard University, wrote for The Washington Post in 2014. \"And when that happened, their brains stopped learning and their genitals became over-developed and a sexual threat to Whites. Some politicians openly advocated for the castration of Black boys.\"No matter that there was never any evidence to support these theories; the important thing was to plant the idea, water it with fear and watch the animosity grow.Emmett TillHistory is filled with examples of the sometimes lethal consequences that racist perceptions have for Black boys. Maybe the most infamous example occurred in 1955.In August of that year, 14-year-old Emmett Till, who was visiting relatives in Money, Mississippi, was accused of flirting with or making advances at a 21-year-old White woman, Carolyn Bryant (later Bryant Donham). Four days later, her then-husband and his half-brother kidnapped Till, beat him, shot him in the head, tied a 75-pound cotton-gin fan to his neck with barbed wire and then discarded him in the Tallahatchie River -- all punishment for the boy's alleged violation of the state's racial order, for the danger he, a mere child, posed to it.An all-White jury acquitted the two men not even a month after Till's swollen and mangled body was retrieved from the river.Till's story exemplifies a wider truth: Black boys are often viewed differently than their White peers simply because of their race.A study published in 2014 found that one result of the decades-long dehumanization of Black boys is that they're \"seen as older and less innocent and that they prompt a less essential conception of childhood\" than do their White counterparts.Put more bluntly, Black boys aren't seen as children at all -- instead, they're a menace.The cycle continuesThough history offers egregious examples, you don't have to comb through bygone decades to observe the disdain that many Americans have for Black men and boys. You can just look at recent headlines.On Tuesday, a jury issued a guilty verdict in the federal hate crimes trial of the three White men who killed 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery, supporting the prosecution's case that the men chased and murdered Arbery precisely because he was Black.Perhaps coincidentally, the verdict was released almost two years ago to the day -- February 23, 2020 -- on which Travis McMichael, Gregory McMichael and their neighbor William \"Roddie\" Bryan followed Arbery through the streets of a Georgia neighborhood and gunned him down.To illustrate that the McMichaels and Bryan pursued Arbery out of racial animus, the prosecution highlighted that the three men talked about Black Americans using racist language.Prosecutor Christopher J. Perras said during closing arguments on Monday that Arbery's killers saw \"a Black man in their neighborhood and assumed the worst of him.\"\"This wasn't about trespassing. This wasn't about neighborhood crimes, either. It was about race -- racial assumptions, racial resentment and racial anger,\" Perras said.Last year, during the state murder trial of the three men, Laura Hogue, one of Gregory McMichael's lawyers, unsuccessfully sought to win sympathy for her client by making a comment to jurors about Arbery's \"long, dirty toenails\" -- a move that was decried as a sop to racial assumptions that cast Black men and boys as beasts.\"What she was doing was pulling a page from the age-old textbook on anti-Black violence,\" Caroline Light, a senior lecturer at Harvard University, where her research focuses largely on histories of citizenship and belonging, told CNN. \"That has a very long history in this nation -- the criminalization of Black men and boys as somehow being less than human.\"Light also drew parallels between the McMichaels and Bryan trial and the Zimmerman trial.\"If you look at George Zimmerman's case, the defense did everything it could to smear Trayvon Martin, to make him appear as some terrifying villain rather than a child. And that (practice) is formulaic.\"Of course, the two trials ended in dramatically different ways, at least in part because of the role that video of Arbery's murder played in advancing justice.\"What's true now, that was never true before, is that a White family sitting in their home can have to watch with their own eyes,\" writer Wesley Lowery, who covered the unrest that occurred in Ferguson, Missouri, after a White policeman fatally shot Black 18-year-old Michael Brown in August 2014, told CNN's Laura Jarrett. \"(Video) forces a level of empathy that has otherwise never existed between Black and White America.\"Former US Attorney General Eric Holder echoed some of Lowery's sentiments.\"The jury is actually witnessing what happened,\" Holder told Jarrett. \"Video helps the prosecution a great deal.\"Yet 10 years after Martin's death, it's hard to say that the US is in a fundamentally better place when it comes to the treatment of Black men and boys, even with the recent conviction of Arbery's killers of hate crimes.\"The fact that we still see this (dehumanization of Blackness) is, I think, proof that we've not really come that far,\" Light said. \"I wish that I had a silver lining. But I think that we're going to continue to see these kinds of narratives play out because they're so effective, ultimately (at reinforcing existing power structures).\"",

Boudin's refusal to file charges based on the DNA evidence brought the issue to light.\"Victims of sexual assault should be encouraged and supported in coming forward to undergo sexual assault examinations to identify their perpetrator,\" Boudin said in a news release on Monday. \"Instead, the practice by a police crime lab that my office exposed treats victims like criminals.\"\"It not only violates their privacy, but it dissuades victims from reporting sexual violence -- which makes us all less safe.\" The San Francisco Police Department has implemented immediate changes to the handling of victims' DNA and is currently working on permanent policy changes in conjunction with the DA's office and California's Department of Justice.Read MoreSan Francisco Police will review its policies after DA claims it used sexual assault victims' DNA in unrelated investigations, chief says\"When revelations came to our attention about our department's possible misuse of a DNA profile, I ordered an immediate change to our crime lab practices assuring that it doesn't happen again,\" Scott said in a statement.In addition to victim DNA, the genetic markers of those close to the victim, like housemates or consensual partners may also be collected in order to eliminate them as suspects.Neighboring county isn't waiting for legislation to take a stanceCalifornia's Santa Clara County, home to San Jose, isn't waiting for legislation to make its intentions known.\"Victim DNA does not go into an offender database, period,\" said Santa Clara District Attorney Jeff Rosen on Monday. \"We want to protect victims of sexual assault, not collect evidence from them that can be used against them later.\"San Francisco rape controversy will have a chilling effectRosen joined Santa Clara County Supervisor Cindy Chavez for a news conference \"to make crystal clear\" the county is addressing the issue independently of the state and national efforts.\"We want to make sure that all of our policies are airtight when it comes to the DNA rape kit samples collected,\" said Chavez, who represents the east side of San Jose.",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)A Saudi detainee at the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, was sent back to his home country for mental health treatment after being detained by the US government for more than 20 years, the Defense Department announced Monday.Authorities once alleged that the detainee, Mohammed al-Qahtani, was an al Qaeda operative who had planned to be the \"20th hijacker\" on 9/11 but failed to board United Airlines Flight 93, which crashed in rural Pennsylvania. Al-Qahtani was captured near the border of Afghanistan in December 2001 and was transferred to the Guantanamo Bay detention facility in February 2002. After his capture, al-Qahtani was imprisoned, tortured by the US government and -- when charges against him were dropped in 2008 -- left to languish behind bars.But in February, the Periodic Review Board -- a government entity established during the Obama administration to determine whether detainees at the facility were guilty -- recommended repatriating al-Qahtani to a mental health facility in Saudi Arabia. The board \"determined that continued law of war detention of the detainee is no longer necessary to protect against a continuing significant threat to the security of the United States,\" according to public documents.\"The United States appreciates the willingness of Saudi Arabia and other partners to support ongoing U.S. efforts toward a deliberate and thorough process focused on responsibly reducing the detainee population and ultimately closing of the Guantanamo Bay facility,\" the Defense Department said in a statement Monday.Read MoreCNN previously reported that al-Qahtani's lawyers had said he is severely mentally ill, battling schizophrenia, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his torture. While his lawyer, Ramzi Kassem, who has been representing al-Qahtani for over a decade, does not believe al-Qahtani's repatriation means that \"justice was done,\" he is glad his client will be able to receive the care he needs back in Saudi Arabia, Kassem said in a statement. Kassem is a law professor at the City University of New York and has represented al-Qahtani in collaboration with the Center for Constitutional Rights.\"It would not be right to say that justice was done with Mohammed's repatriation because nothing can make up for the torture of a sick man and his incarceration without trial over two decades,\" Kassem said. \"For Mohammed, this is about survival. The end of his long nightmare at Guantanamo means that he finally has a chance to receive the medical attention he desperately needs in Saudi Arabia, with the support of his loving family.\"This is the second repatriation of a Guantanamo detainee during the Biden administration, and the first person to be cleared by the Periodic Review Board and repatriated under President Joe Biden. The other detainee, who was transferred in July 2021, had been cleared by the board for transfer during the Obama administration.Thirty-eight detainees now remain at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. Of those, \"19 are eligible for transfer; 7 are eligible for a Periodic Review Board; 10 are involved in the military commissions process; and two detainees have been convicted in military commissions,\" the Defense Department said.Biden has said publicly that he wants to close the detention facility, and the National Security Council is undergoing a review of the facility.CNN's Mary Kay Mallonee contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)A Chinese government-backed hacking group has breached local government agencies in at least six US states in the last 10 months as part of a persistent information-gathering operation, investigators at cybersecurity firm Mandiant said Tuesday.  The wide range of state agencies targeted include \"health, transportation, labor (including unemployment benefit systems), higher education, agriculture, and court networks and systems,\" the FBI and US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said in a separate, private advisory to state governments obtained by CNN.For agencies in two states, the hackers broke into networks using a critical software flaw that was revealed in December just as the Biden administration was scrambling to respond to the flaw's discovery, according to Mandiant.The revelation shows how difficult it can be to keep state-backed hackers from accessing US networks \u2014 even when US officials are sounding the alarm about a potential threat. And it's a reminder that as many analysts are watching for Russian cyber threats during the Ukraine war, other foreign governments aren't letting up in targeting US networks. The hackers' motives aren't clear, but their victims are \"consistent with an espionage operation,\" the firm said. The list of state agencies affected by the hacking could grow as the investigation continues.Read MoreCISA on December 10 publicly warned that Log4J \u2014 software used by big tech firms around the world \u2014 had a vulnerability that hackers could easily exploit to gain further access to computer systems. Hundreds of millions of computers around the world ran the vulnerable software, US officials later estimated. For weeks, US officials urged companies to update their software; the White House hosted a meeting in January with tech executives to try to address the root problem of software that is not secure by design. Within hours of the CISA advisory, the Chinese hackers had begun using the Log4J flaw to break into the two US state agencies, according to Mandiant. Agencies in four other states were hacked via other means. In one state, Mandiant said, the hackers accessed personal data on some Americans, including names, email addresses and mobile phone numbers. Mandiant declined to name the US states or agencies affected. While the hackers' ultimate objectives are unclear, state agencies could provide a wealth of useful information to foreign spies, whether data related to elections or government contracting. \"This campaign is likely still going on. [The hackers] probably haven't completed their mission,\" said Rufus Brown, senior threat analyst at Mandiant's Advanced Practices team. The hackers have used multiple methods to access the state agency networks, and in some cases have returned to the same compromised network after Mandiant specialists contained the activity.\"CISA is actively working with our JCDC [Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative] private sector partners, including Mandiant, and government partners to address this advanced persistent threat to state government agencies and assist impacted entities,\" a CISA spokesperson said. \"We encourage all organizations and critical infrastructure entities impacted by cyber intrusions to report to CISA, and to visit CISA.gov to take action to protect themselves.\"Mandiant blamed the hacking campaign on a group that the Justice Department has linked with China's civilian intelligence agency. That hacking group, according to a US indictment unsealed in September 2020, has been linked to attempts to breach hundreds of organizations around the world, from hardware makers to pro-democracy politicians in Hong Kong.  \"We firmly oppose and combat cyberattacks of any kind,\" Chinese Embassy in Washington spokesperson Liu Pengyu said in an email. \"We oppose making groundless accusations against China on cyber security and other related issues.\"While Russian spying operations, such as the so-called SolarWinds hacking campaign, have gained considerable attention, analysts say Chinese hacking continues to pose a challenge to the Biden administration's efforts to defend government networks. Suspected Chinese hackers compromised at least five US defense and technology firms in an apparent espionage effort, CNN reported in December.\"We assess that China presents the broadest, most active, and persistent cyber espionage threat to US Government and private sector networks,\" US intelligence agencies said in their annual assessment of global threats released on Tuesday.",

The 24-year-old Pennsylvanian -- who serves as the communications director for the American Conservation Coalition, a conservative environmental group -- often gets pushback from both Democrats and Republicans who say her beliefs are contradictory. \"At this point in my life, I kind of laugh off criticism like that,\" Matthews told CNN, adding that she received similar feedback in college for being young and conservative, as if the two are mutually exclusive.\"Caring about climate change and being conservative and believing in small government are compatible,\" she said. Matthews is representative of the young conservatives who have come of age in a time marked by one crisis after another -- from 9/11 to the 2008 financial collapse, school shootings, climate change and Covid-19. Read MoreYouth activism on these issues, both in the streets and online, gives the impression that this generation is exceptionally liberal, and young Americans ages 18-29 do lean to the left -- only 36% voted for former President Donald Trump in 2020, according to CNN's exit polls. Yet there are a number of young voters who are for limited government and fiscal conservativism but didn't align with Trump and his policies. Now, frustrated by record-high gas prices, grocery prices and Russia's invasion in Ukraine, conservatives believe that both Trump voters and non-Trump voters alike will rally around these core issues, leading to electoral success for Republicans in the 2022 midterms.\"Young Americans are being left behind in Biden's America -- we're facing skyrocketing prices, Biden's gas hike, and we've lost precious time in the classroom that we can't get back. Meanwhile, states with Republican leadership have led the way in economic recovery and getting students back in school and young Americans back to work,\" RNC Deputy Press Secretary Will O'Grady told CNN in a statement. \"The RNC has been on the ground since last cycle, engaging and recruiting our next generation of conservative voters who value freedom, opportunity, and love for our country.\" The RNC said that ahead of 2022, it continues to build out its network with young Americans and is recruiting campus team leaders as part of its Campus Team Leader Initiative, a youth engagement program which started as part of the Trump Victory Fund.One of the largest groups of young Republicans, the College Republicans organization, told CNN it has beefed up its \"volunteer strike force\" which, ahead of the midterms, will focus on making phone calls and knocking on doors for GOP candidates. \"On the right, we're really motivated right now because we're fed up and want change,\" Courtney Britt, the 25-year-old chairman of College Republicans, told CNN. \"The youth vote in the middle is leaning our way right now because they see the things Democrats promised them are not coming to fruition. Maybe it's time to give Republican policies a try.\" Courtney Britt, chairman of College Republicans.A chance for the GOP to win back moderate young AmericansMidterm elections usually don't bode well for the party in power, and 2022 may be no different. It presents an opportunity for the Republican Party to win back some young conservative voters who either withheld from voting for president or voted for Joe Biden in 2020.Since taking office, President Biden's approval rating has declined among young voters and non-Democrats who once supported the Democratic President, according to CNN's latest full CNN/SSRS poll.According to the poll, those younger than 45 make up 60% of the voters who say they cast a ballot for Biden in 2020 and don't approve of the job he is doing. They're only 33% of the voters who say they voted for Biden and approve of him.\"Leadership is up for grabs with young people. We're just really hungry for leadership,\" Matthews, who didn't vote for president in 2020, told CNN.Matthews said that despite not casting a ballot for president in 2020, her decision did \"not necessarily,\" mean she was \"rejecting the conservative movement.\"\"I think Republicans should be looking at 2022 as a huge opportunity to really appeal to the young disillusioned voter,\" she said.Karly Matthews, communications director for the American Conservation Coalition.Like Matthews, Ally Chun, a 20-year-old Republican from New York, said, \"I think that a lot of people are extremely dissatisfied with how things are going now.\" \"How Biden has acted during the situation we've been in with Ukraine is a huge red flag,\" Chun, who voted for Biden in 2020, said. \"I think that's really going to incentivize young Republicans and people who are moderate.\" In 2020 groups like College Republicans for Biden and Gen Z GOP formed, aiming to give center-right Gen Z voters a home amid a Republican administration and presidential reelection campaign they felt did not represent their beliefs or values. At the time, these conservative voters -- who said they prioritized small government, capitalism and free market values but cared deeply about climate change, racial justice and health care access -- told CNN they were disillusioned with Trump and the state of the Republican Party, which they said spewed hate and misinformation. But they were also uncomfortable with Biden and the Democratic platform.For his part, Christopher Trzaska, who founded College Republicans for Biden in 2020 and is from New Jersey, said in 2021 he excitedly cast a ballot for Jack Ciattarelli, the then-Republican candidate for governor in his home state.The 21-year-old, who told CNN he disaffiliated with the Republican Party after the insurrection at the Capitol on January 6, 2021 and re-reregistered as an independent, is eager to vote Republican again in 2022, he said, insisting he is still and always has been a conservative.\"You could drop me in the Bush administration, and I'd feel right at home,\" Trzaska said, although he does understand Gen Z's craving for something new and different. \"Gen Z and many conservatives of my age are looking for someone to shake up the system, but not to burn the country down in the process.\" He noted that his vote for Biden wasn't an endorsement for progressives like Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York or Ilhan Omar of Minnesota.\"Looking ahead to 2024, who knows? If it's Trump, absolutely not,\" Trzaska said. \"But if it's Ron DeSantis against Kamala Harris, that's a decision to make, and that's not a given one.\" \"Trump is the leader of the Republican Party, I think that's pretty evident in terms of just the mathematics of it,\" Trzaska said, and while he opposes the former President, he said that \"not every Trump endorsement is created equal,\" adding that he could back a Trump-endorsed candidate, depending on who that candidate is.Christopher Trzaska, who founded of College Republicans for Biden in 2020.The key issues for young Republicans: Gas prices, grocery prices, and foreign policyAccording to Britt, who listed high gas and grocery prices as issues for young Americans, College Republicans are \"not as different from the general population\" when it comes to the issues they care about most this election cycle.\"We definitely hear from a number of people especially with inflation these days, complaining about gas prices and groceries and other day to day things that affect them,\" Ebo Entsuah, a city councilman in Clermont, Florida, said.Ebo Entsuah, a city councilman in Clermont, Florida.Despite his position as a nonpartisan elected official, Entsuah, who is 28 years old, leans to the right. Entsuah said he's heard from many of his peers, even those who lean further to the left who feel, \"fed up and sick of the way the current administration has been going about its work and having nothing to show for it.\"\"What's happening in Ukraine right, and with foreign policy, just adds to additional frustration that Republicans across the board have with this current administration, have with Congress. That doesn't fare well for Democrats in 2022,\" said Iowa state Rep. Joe Mitchell, a Republican who founded Run GenZ, a group that is recruiting, mentoring and training young conservatives to run for down ballot office. The group plans to work with 36 candidates across the country running for state and local offices in 2022.Likewise, Topher D'Anna, spokesperson for Karoline Leavitt -- a Gen Z Republican running for Congress in New Hampshire's 1st Congressional District -- said the young voters Leavitt talks to along the campaign trail have expressed the same concerns as their older counterparts.\"In years past you've seen younger voters be focused on issues such as climate change or things like that, and they still are, but the turnaround if you will... you have all of these generations focused on the same thing is pretty incredible,\" D'Anna said.\"Despite these people being younger, high gas prices are hitting them. They're seeing the cost of inflation as well. So it's a lot about the economics and why we need fiscal conservative policies in the cycle that we're in right now,\" he said.Leavitt, who worked as an assistant press secretary in the Trump White House under press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, and following the 2020 election, served as communications director for GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, is part of House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy's \"Young Guns\" recruitment program, which includes promising candidates in competitive races who have met key fundraising benchmarks. The congressional candidate has also touted false claims that Trump won the 2020 presidential election.While young Republicans are emphasizing spending and inflation as the issues they care about most this election cycle, a focus on the economy is not unprecedented for young conservative voters.\"It is not remotely unusual for economic issues, debt, to be top of mind for young Republicans,\" said Abby Kiesa, who has been polling young Americans for over a decade and is the deputy director of CIRCLE. On top of inflation and concerns about the war in Ukraine, John Olds, the 22-year-old founder of Gen Z GOP, said that young Americans still care about the lasting impact of Covid-19 restrictions.\"When you're a young person, you're super frustrated that your senior year of college was ruined by the pandemic, or you're not getting to go to your own graduation or your own prom, or any one of these seminal life moments that we used to take for granted,\" Olds said. \"Life has been put on hold for little bit too long and that sentiment is associated more with Democratic leadership,\" he said.Like Olds, Gurtej Singh Narang, who is the vice chair of Georgia College Republicans and a student at Georgia State University, believes that politicians' comments and actions on Covid restrictions will also be the \"number one messaging factor with GOP for young people in Georgia,\" he said. \"When it comes to (the race) against Stacey Abrams, we were one of the first states to open,\" Narang, who is 22 years old and worked on both of Trump's presidential campaigns as well as Georgia Governor Brian Kemp's 2018 election campaign and former Sen. David Perdue's 2020 reelection campaign, said. He believes young Republicans will automatically assume Abrams holds many of the same policies as the Biden administration and Democrats who were strict on Covid restrictions. Gurtej Narang, vice chair of Georgia College Republicans.Trump's pull still there but waning with younger Republicans, some sayAs for young Republicans' vision for the party moving forward, both Olds and Narang said they believe the weight of Trump's endorsement is still noteworthy but waning with younger Republicans.\"The Trump endorsement kind of has been losing its power among young people,\" Narang told CNN. \"That being said there are your kids that still like are very, 'whoever Trump endorses should be the guy,'\" he said, adding that Trump is \"definitely\" still a factor in Georgia's GOP primary races, especially when it comes to the state's gubernatorial race between Kemp and Perdue.Olds said he believes the Republican party is making an effort to recruit \"post Trump\" candidates, citing Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who notably improved the GOP's standing with younger voters since the state's last gubernatorial election in 2017. \"Donald Trump obviously still has a hold on a good bit of the party, but I think that hold is certainly weakening,\" Olds said. \"Just speaking with activists on the ground and seeing what happened in Virginia, you can tell that the party still values electability, and since the former President lost, his brand is not as associated with electability.\"While Olds' view may match other moderate young Republicans, on the whole Republican and Republican-leaning voters are about evenly split between wanting their party to nominate Trump again (50%) or wanting a different candidate (49%) in 2024, according to a CNN poll conducted by SSRS last month.\"Where we see ourselves plugging in is defining where the party is moving forward, and not necessarily on the past,\" Olds said of Gen Z GOP, who phone banked for Youngkin. According to CNN's exit polls, 45% of 18- to 29-year-olds voted for Youngkin in Virginia last fall, compared to the 32% of 18-year-olds who voted for 2017 Republican candidate Ed Gillespie.\"If Virginia's elections last year indicated anything, it suggests that we are holding and gaining momentum on the right and they are losing it on the left, at least among youth voters,\" Britt said, noting College Republicans enthusiasm for Youngkin in Virginia last fall.After his victory, Youngkin was credited with writing a new Republican playbook for keeping Trump's base engaged without alienating the voters who were repelled by the former President in recent elections.His popularity with younger Republicans suggests there may be momentum for the \"post-Trump\" candidates Olds described.\"Young Republicans might not be marching in the streets, but they are mobilizing,\" said Mitchell, who, in his role as president of Run Gen Z, travels the country speaking to young Republicans across the ideological spectrum including chapters of College Republicans, Young Republicans and Turning Point USA -- the right-wing organization closely tied to Trump.\"It's not necessarily the sexy protest scene that you're going to see on TV, but you're going to see these things on college campuses, in local races, and so I think all those things add up to proving that there is a lot of mobilizing happening that maybe hasn't happened in years past,\" Mitchell said.\"Will there be a larger number of young Republicans who show up in 2022 than in the last midterms in 2018, 100%,\" he said. \"I do think this year -- 2022 -- will be an unprecedented year for Republicans in the midterms, which naturally will bring along young Republicans as well.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Earlier this year an underwater volcano erupted in Tonga, triggering a widespread tsunami. While advisories were issued, there was confusion at the time because the event wasn't triggered by an earthquake, which tsunami forecasting models don't take into account.And last week a 7.4 magnitude earthquake in Japan sparked tsunami alerts across the country. The Japanese tsunami system worked very well, issuing alerts within minutes of the earthquake.But how would have the US Tsunami Warning System handled a similar situation?According to a recent report, experts are skeptical that the United States would have been able to issue alerts at similar speeds.The report, written by an advisory panel of tsunami experts, says the US warning system is in dire need of an overhaul, struggling with outdated technology, delayed forecasts and disjointed communication.Read MoreIt warns the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Science Advisory Board (NOAA SAB) that there is an \"urgent need for action\" as it is only a matter of time until another tsunami poses a threat to the coastal US.\"The problems we observed and commented on result in a great deal of confusion among local officials, the public, and the media when a tsunami occurs,\" Rocky Lopes, co-chair of the Tsunami Science & Technology Advisory Panel (TSTAP), and a co-author of the report, told CNN. People watch waters rise from beaches in Santa Cruz, California, amid a tsunami advisory following the Tonga volcanic eruption.Tsunamis are extremely large waves that occur as a result of a sharp displacement in the ocean. They are most commonly caused by earthquakes but can also be triggered by volcanic eruptions and landslides. These towering waves can cause widespread damage to coastal communities and, most importantly, result in high death tolls. Areas along the Pacific Ocean such as California, Alaska and Hawaii are particularly at risk of tsunamis. That's because earthquakes and volcanic activity are heightened around the Pacific Ocean basin, nicknamed the \"Ring of Fire.\"\"It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of residents and employees as well as millions of visitors are within tsunami-prone areas along the coastal regions of the U.S. each year,\" Dr. Nate Wood, supervisory research geographer for the United States Geological Survey, said in the report. Given Tonga's recent volcanic eruption, and the ensuing tsunami waves that reached the West Coast of the United States, urgent updates are needed to protect a growing US coastal population, according to the advisory panel. Two different offices can mean two different messagesThe report's most urgent recommendations include improvements to the NOAA's Tsunami Warning System and its two Tsunami Warning Centers. There are \"gaps and inconsistencies throughout the tsunami warning and forecast process,\" the report warns.Problems include delayed communication of warnings, outdated technology and lack of coordination between the two centers, which often lead to conflicting messages to the public. The National Tsunami Warning Center, located in Palmer, Alaska, covers the Lower 48 states and Alaska and Canada, while The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, located in Honolulu, serves the Hawaiian Islands as well as the US Pacific Islands, Caribbean territories and British Virgin Islands. Tsunamis Fast FactsDue to differing locations and needs, the two centers have individually diversified their technology and methods, causing discrepancies and preventing a seamless backup if one of the two centers were to malfunction, according to the report. The website used to consolidate all of the tsunami bulletins from both warning centers, tsunami.gov, also presented many concerns for TSTAP.\"Tsunami.gov is a consolidated website that presents information in real time from both tsunami warning centers. Unless you really understand where the information is coming from and drill down into all the data, it is hard to know which center is issuing which bulletin and which applies to where,\" Lopes told CNN. The lack of organization and consolidation makes the website difficult for the public and local officials to understand. That has led to problems in recent months. \"For example, when the Tonga volcanic eruption happened on January 15th, some media reported that the US West Coast was under a tsunami warning, and it was not a warning. It is called a tsunami advisory, which is a lower level alert that doesn't require, for example, evacuations,\" Lopes said. Timing is keyAlthough initial reports come quickly from the two warning centers, a full forecast detailing where and when the tsunamis may occur can take up to three hours, according to the report. The advisory panel notes that after an 8.2 magnitude earthquake hit Alaska on July 28, 2021, West Coast states were \"under evaluation\" for three hours after the event. This would have left one hour -- before the tsunami had reached land -- for officials to make announcements regarding evacuations if they had been needed. The advisory panel emphasized the need for the tsunami warning centers to issue earlier estimates of impacts. It said that delayed messaging \"leaves decision makers lost and unable to make important life safety decisions in the time frame necessary to issue a successful evacuation if needed.\"New technology, including data from satellites, could potentially help the warning centers to make more accurate and timely forecasts, according to the advisory panel. And the tsunami experts highlight the lack of a \"standardized system for real time monitoring of the activity, tsunami potential, and tsunami risk\" for sources other than earthquakes.JUST WATCHEDExpert explains what's happening in 'jaw-dropping' eruption video.ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHExpert explains what's happening in 'jaw-dropping' eruption video. 02:12This means for tsunamis caused by landslides or volcanic eruptions, like the Tonga volcano, there are currently no forecasting tools, which could have catastrophic effects. TSTAP encourages collaboration between state and federal agencies to help forecast these events in the short term, while NOAA works to integrate these other sources into their tsunami forecast database. The advisory panel hopes its report will help the two tsunami warning centers to \"better coordinate and align their methods, forecasting, and messaging.\" \"NOAA will provide a formal written response to our report, which is due by the end of this calendar year. That report will detail what they are doing in response to our recommendations and that will be posted on the NOAA SAB website,\" Lopes said.He said that if there are actual changes to the systems, there will also be a public notification statement on the NWS website.The time is now to prepare for tsunamis Sunday is the start of Tsunami Awareness Week, which encourages people who live in high risk areas to prepare for potential events. State, federal and local offices urge coastal communities to recognize the risk they are under and become as \"tsunami ready\" as possible. Tsunami Advisories remain in effect for Alaska, Hawaii, and the West Coast.

Tsunami Awareness Week coincides with the anniversary of the 1964 Alaska tsunami that killed over 130 people and caused unprecedented damage to property.",

        "content": "(CNN)As the US attempts to wean itself off its heavy reliance on fossil fuels and shift to cleaner energy sources, many experts are eyeing a promising solution: your neighborhood big-box stores and shopping malls.The rooftops and parking lot space available at retail giants like Walmart, Target and Costco is massive. And these largely empty spaces are being touted as untapped potential for solar power that could help the US reduce its dependency on foreign energy, slash planet-warming emissions and save companies millions of dollars in the process.At the IKEA store in Baltimore, installing solar panels on the roof and over the store's parking lot cut the amount of energy it needed to purchase by 84%, slashing its costs by 57% from September to December of 2020, according to the company. (The panels also provide some beneficial shade to keep customers' cars cool on hot, sunny days.) Could Russia's war kick-start a renewable-energy revolution? It depends where in the world you lookAs of February 2021, IKEA had 54 solar arrays installed across 90% of its US locations.Big-box stores and shopping centers have enough roof space to produce half of their annual electricity needs from solar, according to a report from nonprofit Environment America and research firm Frontier Group. Read MoreLeveraging the full rooftop solar potential of these superstores would generate enough electricity to power nearly 8 million average homes, the report concluded, and would cut the same amount of planet-warming emissions as pulling 11.3 million gas-powered cars off the road.The average Walmart store, for example, has 180,000 square feet of rooftop, according to the report. That's roughly the size of three football fields and enough space to support solar energy that could power the equivalent of 200 homes, the report said.\"Every rooftop in America that isn't producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them,\" Johanna Neumann, senior director for Environment America's campaign for 100% Renewable, told CNN. \"Now is the time to lean into local renewable energy production, and there's no better place than the roofs of America's big-box superstores.\" Advocates involved in clean energy worker-training programs tell CNN that a solar revolution in big-box retail would also be a significant windfall for local communities, spurring economic growth while tackling the climate crisis, which has inflicted disproportionate harm on marginalized communities.Yet only a fraction of big-box stores in the US have solar on their rooftops or solar canopies in parking lots, the report's authors told CNN.  Why record-high gas prices won't be solved by drilling more oil in the US CNN reached out to five of the top US retailers \u2014 Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, Costco and Target \u2014 to ask: Why not invest in more rooftop solar?Many renewable energy experts point to solar as a relatively simple solution to cut down on costs and help rein in fossil fuel emissions, but the companies point to several roadblocks \u2014 regulations, labor costs and structural integrity of the rooftops themselves \u2014 that are preventing more widespread adoption.The need for these kinds of clean energy initiatives is becoming \"unquestionably urgent\" as the climate crisis accelerates, said Edwin Cowen, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University.\"We are behind the eight ball, to put it mildly,\" Cowen told CNN. \"I would have loved to see policy help incentivize rooftop solar 15 years ago instead of five years ago in the commercial space. There's still a tremendous amount of work to do.\"What's the holdup?Neumann said Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, possesses by far the largest solar potential. Walmart has around 5,000 stores in the US and more than 783 million square feet of rooftop space \u2014 an area larger than Manhattan \u2014 and more than 8,974 gigawatt hours of annual rooftop solar potential, according to the report. It's enough electricity to power more than 842,000 homes, the report said. \"Every rooftop in America that isn't producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them.\"Johanna Neumann, Environment AmericaWalmart spokesperson Mariel Messier told CNN the company is involved in renewable energy projects around the world, but many of them are not rooftop solar installations. The company has reported having completed on- and off-site wind and solar projects or had others under development with a capacity to produce more than 2.3 gigawatts of renewable energy.Neumann said Environment America has met with Walmart a few times, urging the retailer to commit to installing solar panels on roofs and in parking lots. The company has said it's aiming to source 100% of its energy through renewable projects by 2035.\"Of all the retailers in America, Walmart stands to make the biggest impact if they put rooftop solar on all of their stores,\" Neumann told CNN. \"And for us, this report just underscores just how much of an impact they could make if they make that decision.\"According to Environment America, Walmart had installed almost 194 megawatts of solar capacity on its US facilities as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year and additional capacity in off-site solar farms. The company's installations in California were expected to provide between 20% to 30% of each location's electricity needs.Solar panels on the roof of a Target store in Inglewood, California, in 2020. Target ranked No. 1 for on-site solar capacity in 2019, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.Target ranked No. 1 for on-site solar capacity in 2019, according to industry trade group Solar Energy Industries Association's most recent report. It currently has 542 locations with rooftop solar \u2014 around a quarter of the company's stores \u2014 a Target spokesperson told CNN. Rooftop solar generates enough energy to meet 15% to 40% of Target properties' energy needs, the spokesperson said.Richard Galanti, the chief financial officer at Costco, said the company has 121 stores with rooftop solar around the world, 95 of which are in the US. Walmart, Target and Costco did not share with CNN what their biggest barriers are to adding rooftop or parking lot solar panels to more stores.Approximate number of households companies could power with rooftop solarWalmart \u2014 842,700Target \u2014 259,900Home Depot \u2014 256,600Kroger \u2014 192,500Costco \u2014 87,500Source:  Environment America, Frontier Group report, \"Solar on Superstores\"\"My suspicion is that they want an even stronger business case for deviating from business-as-usual,\" Neumann said. \"Historically, all those roofs have done is cover their stores, and rethinking how [they] use their buildings and thinking of them as energy generators, not just protection from rain, requires a small change in their business model.\"Home Depot, which has around 2,300 stores, currently has 75 completed rooftop solar projects, 12 in construction and more than 30 planned for future development, said Craig D'Arcy, the company's director of energy management. Solar power generates around half of these stores' energy needs on average, he said. Aging rooftops at stores are a \"huge impediment\" to solar installation, D'Arcy added. If a roof needs to be replaced in the next 15 to 20 years or sooner, it doesn't make financial sense for Home Depot to add solar systems today, he said.\"We have a goal of implementing solar rooftop where the economics are attractive,\" D'Arcy told CNN. CNN also reached out to Kroger, which owns about 2,800 stores across the US. Kristal Howard, a Kroger spokesperson, said the company currently has 15 properties \u2014 stores, distribution centers and manufacturing plants \u2014 with solar installations. One of the \"multiple factors affecting the viability of a solar installation\" was the stores' ability to support a solar installation on the roofs, Howard said.A worker walks among solar panels being installed on the roof of an IKEA in Miami in 2014. As of February, IKEA had solar installed at 90% of its US locations.Cowen, the engineering professor at Cornell, said solar is already attractive, but that labor costs, incentives and the different layers of regulation likely pose some financial challenges in solar installations. \"For them, this means usually hiring a local site firm that can do that installation that also knows local policy,\" Cowen said. \"It's just another layer of complexity that I think is beginning to make sense because the costs have come down enough, but it needs kind of reopening that door of getting into an existing building.\"'Delay means death': We're running out of ways to adapt to the climate crisis, new report shows. Here are the key takeaways Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois, who co-chairs the power sector task force in the House, said the US has \"failed to provide the incentives to people who have the expertise to go in and build these things.\" The reason both retail companies and the power sector have not made much progress on solar is because \"our system is so disjointed\" and has a complex regulation structure, Casten said.\"Why aren't we doing something that makes economic sense? The answer is this horribly disjointed federal policy where we massively subsidize fossil energy extraction, and we penalize clean energy production,\" Casten told CNN. \"For a long, long time, if you wanted to build a solar panel on the rooftop of Walmart, your biggest enemy was going to be your local utility because they didn't want to lose the load.\"We could have done this decades ago,\" Casten added. \"And had we done it, we would not be in this dire position with the climate, but we'd also have a lot more money in our pocket.\"Acting on climate, equitablyFor Charles Callaway, director of organizing at the nonprofit group WE ACT for Environmental Justice, strengthening the rooftop solar capacity in big box retail stores is a no-brainer, especially if companies allow the local community to reap benefits either through installation jobs or sharing the electricity produced later.Either way, it would put a massive dent in curbing the climate crisis and help usher in an equitable transition away from fossil fuels \u2014 and it's doable, Callaway told CNN.Solar panels on the roof of a Costco store in Ingelwood, California, in 2021. Costco told CNN 95 stores in the US have rooftop solar installations. The New York City resident led a worker training program that helped train more than 100 local community members, mostly people of color, to become solar installers. He also formed a solar workers cooperative to ensure many of the participants of the training program get jobs in a tough market. In the last two years, Callaway said his group has not only installed solar panels on roofs of affordable housing units, but also equipment capable of producing 2 megawatts of solar energy on shopping malls up in upstate New York. He emphasized that hiring locally would be most beneficial since local installers know the community and local regulations best. Allergy season will start much earlier than normal and be far more intense because of climate crisis, study suggests \"One of my huge concerns is social equity,\" Cowen said. \"Access to renewable energy is a fairly privileged position these days, and we've got to figure out ways to make that not true.\"Jasmine Graham, WE ACT's energy justice policy manager, said the potential of building rooftop solar on big box superstores is encouraging, only \"if these projects use local labor, if they are paying prevailing wages, and if this solar is being used in a manner such as community solar, which would allow [utility] bill discounts for folks that live in the same utility zone.\"Pressure is mounting for global leaders to act urgently on the climate crisis after a UN report in late February warned the window for action is rapidly closing.Neumann believes the US can meet its energy demand with renewables. All it takes, she said, is the political will to make that switch, and the inclusion of the local community so no one gets left behind in the transition. \"The sooner we make that transition, the sooner we'll have cleaner air, the sooner we'll have a more protected environment and better health and the sooner we'll have a more livable future for our kids,\" Neumann said. \"And even if that requires investment, it is an investment worth making.\"CNN's Judson Jones contributed to this report.",

The submarine, which opened as an exhibit more than four decades ago, closed to the public in December due to \"safety concerns caused by a leak in a main ballast tank,\" the museum said in a news release. Ballast tanks are used to control the buoyancy of a vessel.The submarine has undergone repairs for more than a decade due to \"extensive corrosion,\" the museum added. One 2019 assessment found it would cost \"upwards of $9 million\" to fully restore and repair the vessel, the museum said. There are also environmental concerns -- including the presence of PCBs and lead batteries -- with keeping the submarine at Patriots Point, said executive director Dr. Rorie Cartier.\"Leaving this submarine in the Charleston Harbor could cause serious environmental problems with the landfall of a major hurricane,\" Cartier said.  The museum is located in Mt. Pleasant, less than 10 miles from Charleston.Read MoreThe USS Clamagore is the only submarine of its design that is preserved in the US, according to the museum's website. Commissioned in June 1945, the boat operated in the Caribbean, the Atlantic and the Mediterranean until 1962. The submarine is best known for its service off of Florida's Key West coast, where it became known as the \"Gray Ghost of the Florida Coast,\" according to the museum. It was decommissioned in 1975 and opened as a museum about six years later. It's the smallest of the three military vessels kept on display at the museum. But the museum \"cannot financially sustain the maintenance\" of all three, Cartier said. \"The USS Yorktown and USS Laffey also need repair, and we are fighting a never-ending battle against the corrosion that comes from being submerged in saltwater,\" Cartier said.Some key parts of the submarine will be removed and preserved for a smaller exhibit, the museum said. Other parts will be sold and reused or recycled. The full dismantling project will take months and cost around $2 million, according to the museum. \"The vast majority of the steel will be used to make new products, lowering the demand for mined iron ore and reducing energy costs in the steelmaking process,\" it said.",

So there's a number of patterns that could fit the story,\" he added.One of the largest studies done on the topic, the report's results clarify prior research in smaller populations that showed an inconsistent association between BPA and respiratory disorders, Trasande said. The six countries in the study were Spain, France, Greece, Norway, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.The American Chemistry Council, which represents the chemical industry, provided CNN the following statement:\"The limited study design is based on single samples to measure exposure and therefore is not capable of establishing a causal relationship between BPA and childhood asthma or wheeze. It is problematic to draw any meaningful conclusions from this report,\" said Jennifer Garfinkel, director of product communications for the American Chemistry Council.Can linings and thermal paperOne of the most studied bisphenols, BPA is a known endocrine disruptor, capable of altering hormones in the body. Fetuses and babies are especially vulnerable: BPA has been linked to fetal abnormalities, low birth weight, and brain and behavior disorders in infants and children.High BPA levels linked to 49% greater risk of death within 10 years, study saysIn adults, BPA has been linked to diabetes, heart disease, cancer, obesity and erectile dysfunction. Premature death was also associated with BPA exposure, a 2020 study found. People who had higher levels of bisphenol A in their urine were about 49% more likely to die during a 10-year period. Around since the 1950s, bisphenol A can be found in beverage containers, the lining of canned foods, dental sealants and many toys, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The chemical was used to create baby bottles, sippy cups and infant formula containers until concerned parents boycotted those products more than a decade ago. The US Food and Drug Administration responded with a 2012 ban on use in baby bottles and sippy cups, followed by a 2013 ban on use in infant formula packaging.However, the FDA has not banned use of BPA in other food products, saying \"the available information continues to support the safety of BPA for the currently approved uses in food containers and packaging.\"Only BPA connected to asthmaUrine samples were collected from pregnant women in the study between the years of 1999 and 2010, when BPA was commonly used. The study found BPA in 90% of maternal urine samples taken during pregnancy.BPA-free plastic alternatives may not be safe as you thinkChildren born to those mothers had their lungs tested by spirometry between the ages of 7 and 11; mothers filled out questionnaires on their child's wheezing and lung function. Of the several bisphenols analyzed, BPA was the only one associated with respiratory symptoms such as asthma and wheezing during elementary school age, according to the study. \"The result is quite significant and it seems to align with the latest European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reevaluation of the risk to public health related to BPA exposures,\" said independent consultant Maricel Maffini, a biological scientist who has published studies on bisphenols and was not involved with the study.\"EFSA identified the immune system as the most sensitive health outcome associated with BPA toxicity. It included effects such as asthma, allergy, and wheeze, among others,\" Maffini added.Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.The researchers also examined bisphenol F and bisphenol S, which manufacturers sell as \"BPA-free\" plastic substitutes that are intended to be safer than BPA. The study found extremely low levels of BPF and BPS in urine samples and did not find any consistent associations with respiratory outcomes. That's likely because the study was conducted before those alternatives became widely available, Trasande said.However, research in animals is finding the same effects on prenatal development from BPS, linking it to problems with embryonic development and premature birth. Studies are also finding links to disruptions in the thyroid hormone system and heart arrhythmia.How to avoid BPAToday, BPA exposure is mostly through food and water contaminated by the linings of aluminum cans and beverages, followed by exposure to the thermal paper used to create shopping receipts, Trasande said.You can limit your exposure by avoiding plastics as much as possible, he said. When using plastics, never put them in a microwave or dishwasher, because the heat can break down the linings and make them more easily absorbed. Other tips include:Cook at home often to reduce your use of processed foods.Use unscented lotions and laundry detergents.Use cleaning supplies without scents.Use glass, stainless steel, ceramic or wood to hold and store foods.Buy fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables instead of canned and processed versions.Encourage frequent handwashing to remove chemicals from hands.Avoid air fresheners and all plastics labeled as No. 3, No. 6 and No. 7.",

The US and other NATO member nations have fulfilled a number of Zelensky's requests, while stopping short of certain measures they say could risk an escalation in the war. Weapons assistanceThe military aid provided to Ukraine so far includes weapons that range from portable drones to complex, long-range missile systems. Read MoreSwitchblade drones. Small, portable, so-called kamikaze drones that carry warheads and detonate on impact. The smallest model can hit a target up to six miles away, according to the company that produces the drones, AeroVironment.

This guided missile system can be shoulder-fired by a single solider and has a range of up to 8,200 feet. AT-4 anti-armor systems. These Swedish anti-armor weapons are \"lightweight, single-shot and fully disposable,\" according to the company that produces them, Saab Bofors Dynamics.Patriot air defense missile system. The US also delivered two missile defense systems to Poland this month intended to deter Russia and boost Poland's security amid Western concerns that the Ukraine conflict could spill into NATO-aligned nations.The Patriot air defense missile system -- Patriot stands for \"Phased Array Tracking Radar to Intercept of Target\" -- is designed to counter and destroy incoming short-range ballistic missiles, advanced aircraft and cruise missiles.The battery includes missiles and launching stations, a radar set that detects and tracks targets, and an engagement control station, according to the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance.Other actionsBeyond military aid to Ukraine, the US and its NATO allies have issued a slew of sanctions against Russia.Putin. The United States, European Union, United Kingdom and Canada have announced they would introduce sanctions targeting Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.SWIFT.

The House of Representatives has passed a bill to suspend normal trade relations with Russia. The final vote was 424-8 with strong bipartisan support for the legislation, which next heads to the Senate.Energy and oil. EU officials said the bloc would slash imports of Russian natural gas by two-thirds this year, and the EU announced a plan to achieve energy independence from Moscow \"well before 2030.\" That would separate Europe from its single biggest energy supplier.Separately, President Joe Biden announced a ban on Russian oil, natural gas and coal imports to the United States. And the UK government said Tuesday it would phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022 and explore ways of ending natural gas imports as well.Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Germany has halted certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline following Moscow's actions.Unfulfilled Ukrainian requestsAs Russia's deadly invasion has continued, Zelensky has requested some actions that Western allies fear would put them in direct conflict with the Kremlin and escalate the war.No-fly zone. Zelensky has repeatedly called on Ukraine's allies to establish a no-fly zone over the country. A no-fly zone is an area where certain aircraft cannot fly for any number of reasons. In the context of a conflict such as the one in Ukraine, it would probably mean a zone in which Russian planes were not allowed to fly, to prevent them from carrying out airstrikes against Ukraine.The problem with military no-fly zones is that they have to be enforced by a military power. If a Russian aircraft flew into a NATO no-fly zone, then NATO forces would have to take action against that aircraft. Those measures could include shooting the plane from the sky. That would, in Russia's eyes, be an act of war by NATO and would likely escalate the conflict.S-300 missile defense systems. This surface-to-air missile system can strike targets that are both higher in altitude and farther away than Stinger missiles are designed for. Slovakia has preliminarily agreed to provide Ukraine with a key Soviet-era air defense system to help defend against Russian airstrikes, according to three sources familiar with the matter. But the US and NATO are still grappling with how to backfill that country's own defensive capabilities, and the transfer is not yet assured.MiG fighter jets. Earlier this month, the US dismissed a proposal from Poland to transfer its MiG-29 fighter jets to the United States for delivery to Ukraine. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement that the US did not believe Poland's proposal was \"tenable\" and that it was too risky. \"The prospect of fighter jets 'at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America' departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,\" Kirby said.",

President Joe Biden revived the metric on his first day in office, setting it at $51 per ton of carbon dioxide emissions -- the same level set by the Obama administration.Biden's administration had been expected to update the figure in February but was blocked by the earlier ruling.Read MoreTen Republican-led states brought the lawsuit against the Biden administration. In the February ruling blocking the metric, US District Judge James Cain of the Western District of Louisiana sided with the states, saying the administration's carbon cost estimate \"will significantly drive up costs\" while decreasing state revenue.The appeals court disagreed with Cain's argument.\"The government defendants are likely to succeed on the merits because the plaintiffs states lack standing,\" the appellate ruling states, adding that the arguments of Republican attorneys general that their states were injured by the metric were \"purely hypothetical.\"The Biden administration, meanwhile, has \"shown they will be irreparably harmed absent a stay,\" the court wrote. \"The preliminary injunction halts the President's directive to agencies in how to make agency decisions, before they make those decisions.\"The previous injunction blocking the metric had delayed several rule makings in the administration as well as decisions on upcoming oil and gas leases on federal lands.\"We appreciate the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit's decision to grant a stay of the preliminary injunction related to the use of social cost of greenhouse gases,\" Melissa Schwartz, a spokesperson for Interior, said in a statement. \"Calculating the social cost of greenhouse gas emissions provides important information that has been part of the foundation of the work the Interior Department has undertaken over the past year. With this ruling, the Department continues its planning for responsible oil and gas development on America's public lands and waters.\"Hana Vizcarra, a senior attorney for Earthjustice, said the appellate court's decision \"sent a strong message that the rule of law cannot be short-circuited to score political victories.\"\"It puts the government back on track to address and assess climate change,\" Vizcarra added.This story has been updated with a response from the Interior Department.",

        "content": "(CNN)As Russia's brutal war in Ukraine disrupts energy supply and forces world leaders to examine their dependence on Russian oil and natural gas, leaders in the United States and Europe are scrambling to fill the gaps.  UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson this week advocated for new oil and gas drilling in the North Sea in the name of energy security, and there are talks in the UK and in Germany of delaying the closure of some coal-fired power plants.  Why record-high gas prices won't be solved by drilling more oil in the USThere's also increased pressure on the oil- and natural gas-rich US to produce more to send to Europe, and US President Joe Biden is trying to get Middle Eastern countries to produce more oil to help bring sky-high gasoline prices down.  This is all bad news for the climate crisis \u2014 which is caused by the burning of fossil fuels \u2014 but they are short-term responses. There is also good reason to believe that the upheaval brought by Russia's war will speed the transition to clean energy in the long run.  While Johnson wrote of more drilling, he also wrote of doubling down on renewable energy, such as solar or wind power. A UK government spokesperson told CNN that a new energy strategy to be revealed next week will \"supercharge\" its renewables and nuclear capacity.Read MoreIn Germany, which is highly dependent on Russian gas, the government brought forward its deadline for a full transition to renewables in its power sector by at least five years, to 2035. But in the US, the path toward a clean energy transition has stalled in the Congress.  An 'excruciating year': Climate activists reset with Biden's agenda on life support  \"The war will supercharge the European energy transition \u2014 most European leaders understand that diversifying from fossil fuels is a path to greater security,\" Nikos Tsafos, an energy expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNN in an email interview. \"The response in the United States has been more bifurcated \u2014 some calling for more oil and gas production, others for more investments in renewable energy.\" Ultimately, Europe and the US are on a different footing with their clean energy transitions. The European Union, for example, has a detailed emissions target in law and a road map to cut emissions 55% by 2030. Biden's administration has undertaken a number of executive actions and federal regulations to work toward the US emissions goal to cut 50-52% of emissions by 2030. But his target is lacking legislative teeth.  \"We must walk and chew gum \u2014 address supply in the short term because families need to take their kids to school, and go to work, get groceries and go about their lives \u2014 and often that requires gas,\" a White House spokesperson told CNN. \"But in the long term we must speed up \u2014 not slow down \u2014 our transition to a clean energy future.\" The Westlands Solar Park near Lemoore, California.The EU road map still needs a vote, but it is backed by policies already underway. And many European countries have more developed clean energy infrastructure than the US, which is just starting to build out its offshore wind. In 2020, the EU and UK had the capacity to produce around 49% of their electricity from renewables, almost twice that of the US' 25%, according to the International Renewables Energy Agency. The EU and UK combined have about double the solar power capacity and wind capacity of the US, the agency has reported.  \"It's clear Europe has a game plan and the US has a target, which is not the same thing,\" said John Larsen, a partner at the nonpartisan Rhodium Group.  The renewables raceIn an interview with The Washington Post, International Energy Agency executive director Fatih Birol said Monday he believed the current situation in Europe was the first truly global energy crisis the world has faced \u2014 and could shape global energy for years to come.  \"It can be a turning point,\" Birol said, noting that governments responded to the oil shortage of the 1970s by making cars more fuel efficient and investing in nuclear energy. \"I am also hopeful that at the end of the first global energy crisis, countries, not just states, will come up with new energy policies accelerating the clean energy transitions.\" Europe is already heading in that direction.  \"It's amazing how fast the Europeans have moved,\" said Sam Ori, executive director of the University of Chicago's Energy Policy Institute. \"They're racing toward clean electricity.\" The Burbo Bank Offshore Wind Farm in Liverpool Bay on the west coast of the UK.Biden's administration has done several things on its own: proposing new regulations on vehicle emissions and methane; greenlighting offshore wind projects as well as onshore renewables; and taking executive actions on industrial emissions. Still, Biden has been unable to get much of his clean energy and climate agenda through Congress so far, and experts say he doesn't have much hope of reaching his emissions targets without it.   Fact check: Despite claims of Trump-era 'energy independence,' the US never stopped importing foreign oil A recent Princeton University analysis showed that the clean-energy provisions in Biden's now-shelved Build Back Better Act would have prevented 1.3 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions from entering the atmosphere through 2035. US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm told CNN Wednesday that the current global energy crunch should spur action in Congress as soon as possible. \"This is a moment for Congress to be able to act,\" Granholm told CNN at a clean energy event Wednesday. \"There can be a compromise. There can be movement on this. The bottom line is this is a moment to have this happen; it's an urgent moment.\" But there is no clear path in Congress to transition the US away from fossil fuels. Getting off Russian oil is one thing Democrats and Republicans can agree on; a bipartisan group recently came together to pass a House bill banning Russian oil imports to the US.  That's where harmony on energy ends.  Instead of simply drilling for more oil and gas, officials in Biden's administration and many Democrats in Congress have long argued that passing billions in tax credits for electric vehicles and renewable energy is a key way to relieve the US from its dependence on foreign oil, and will help insulate the country against future gas price shocks.  Traffic moves along Interstate 80 in Berkeley, California. As climate action in Congress stalls, the Biden administration has taken steps on its own, including proposing new regulations on vehicle emissions.Republicans, on the other hand, argue this is a moment to get drilling.   In the middle of the two sides sits Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the Democrats' swing vote on climate and clean energy legislation. Manchin has expressed support for Biden's clean energy package, but he represents a coal state, and wants more drilling and fossil fuel infrastructure built. Natural gas is expensive, dirty and financing war. Here are 5 ways to use less of it to heat your home Beyond the future of the US clean energy legislation, more questions remain. Russia is also a major exporter of metals needed for electric vehicles and clean energy technology, which could hamper the transition to EVs.  The fate of Biden's climate policy \u2014 and how quickly the US can transition to clean energy \u2014 largely depends on Manchin's vote. There's still no actual legislative package that's been agreed upon, and Biden and congressional Democrats realistically have the spring and summer to get a Democrat-only bill through Congress before the midterm elections could upend the balance of power in Washington.  Larsen said that while market forces, like continued high oil prices, could nudge consumers away from gas cars and toward electric vehicles, massive federal investment in EVs and clean energy would still be needed. \"Should these higher prices last for a while, they're going to help make the case for accelerating the transition we see with wind and solar, but it's not the same as policy support to actually get there,\" Larsen said. \"Build Back Better and the [clean energy] tax credits, all of that would do 10 times more than these high prices would.\" CNN's Angela Dewan contributed to this report.",

Satellite imagery from NASA shows the blanket of Saharan dust over Western and Central Europe.The strong winds from Storm Celia off the northwest coast of Africa picked up dust from the Sahara desert and lofted it into the atmosphere. The southerly winds then pushed the dust northward into Europe, creating haunting scenes across the region.

Stunning orange and red skies can be expected as the sun rises and sets with reduced visibility and hazy skies anticipated throughout the day. With enough dust in the air to alter the hues of the natural landscape across Western Europe, there is an obvious concern for air quality as well. Spain, France, and Portugal are particularly at risk for decreased air quality as a result of experiencing the highest volumes of dust from the plume.Hazy skies from the Saharan dust plume in Granada, Spain, on Tuesday. On Tuesday, the European Environment Agency already measured dust concentrations in Spain over five times the European Union's recommended threshold for air quality, according to Copernicus, the EU's Earth observation program. Air quality continues to be poor in the region today as well. \"Air quality is recognised as being vital to human health as high concentrations of dust can have health impacts on the respiratory systems of all people in the affected regions and add to particulate matter air pollution from local sources,\" Copernicus states.The reduced air quality leaves those with respiratory issues, such as asthma, particularly vulnerable over the next few days as the air quality continues to diminish. What goes up must come back downLate in the week, Storm Celia is forecast to bring showers across much of Western Europe, with heavy rain expected in southeastern Spain. This chance for greater precipitation brings the potential for \"blood rain\" to parts of Spain as the rain mixes with the high dust concentration. \"It is understood that blood rain occurs when relatively high concentrations of red coloured dust or particles get mixed into rain, giving it a red appearance as it falls,\" the United Kingdom Met Office said. As the rain falls through the atmosphere, it grabs the dust particles that are in the air causing dust deposits to fall and cover cars, houses, and roads. With more dust forecast to move into Western and Central Europe through the end of the week, there will be ample dust in the atmosphere for the rain to bring down to the surface. Once the dust settles, Europe should expect to see the dust clear out by early next week, welcoming back blue skies and increased air quality. Saharan dust plumes are not an uncommon phenomenon in Europe Dust storms are a familiar occurrence in the meteorology world, particularly in dry areas. They are usually caused by storm systems moving into an area where the strong winds are able to lift up the dust across a large region, the WMO notes. We will likely see more of these events in the near future. Climate change could be worsening the Saharan dust transport to Europe, as wind and precipitation patterns change as a result of warming temperatures of the land and ocean. Widespread desertification in Northern Africa and stronger winds over the Mediterranean could be making these dust events more intense, research has shown.",

        "content": "(CNN)The cost of natural gas was already rising fast as the world emerged from repeated Covid lockdowns and demand for energy soared. Now the war in Ukraine is pushing prices even higher.In Europe, countries are planning to dramatically slash their reliance on Russian gas, and while the US doesn't import much gas from Russia, it's also feeling the pain of high prices, which are linked to global markets. It's the same for the UK, which only relies on Russia for 3% of its gas.Millions of people are set to shell out hundreds, possibly even thousands, of extra dollars just to keep their homes warm this year. But there are plenty of ways to keep bills down, and a lot of them will help tackle climate change, too, and help damp gas prices -- which means less money for exporters like Russia. Turn the thermostat downTurning the heat down can have a big impact on energy bills.This is one of the simplest things you can do to save on energy. The International Energy Agency (IEA) says the average building in Europe is set at 22 degrees Celsius (71.6\u00b0Fahrenheit) in the heating season. If all the buildings in the European Union turned down the heat by just 1\u00b0 Celsius, for example, the bloc would need 10 billion cubic meters less gas per year.Read MoreThat's roughly the same amount of natural gas that New York City consumes in three months, or what Hungary or the Czech Republic consume over a year.In the UK, homes can save \u00a380 ($104) a year on their heating bills, according to experts from uSwitch, a UK energy comparison company.This may be a small amount of money, but in terms of climate change, it's 19 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions saved. To put that into perspective, that's around the same as what 4.2 million American cars emit over a year, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.  Lower temperatures indoors are something you can get used to. In Australia, for example, people are advised by the Climate Council to warm their homes to 18\u00b0-20\u00b0C. Sometimes Australians live in those temperatures simply because it's hard to heat houses well there -- many aren't set up for the cold weather and insulation can be poor. Still, people manage.In the US, the Department of Energy recommends people set their thermostats to 68\u00b0 Fahrenheit (20\u00b0C), but the most popular average indoor temperature in American homes is 70\u00b0-75\u00b0F (around 21\u00b0-24\u00b0C). So there's a lot of room to turn temperatures down. \"Having better control over our heating systems doesn't cost anything to do, and it would immediately reduce our bills,\" Will Rivers from the UK-based Carbon Trust, a group that provides solutions to the climate crisis, told CNN.Fit some solar panels Solar panels can provide power for all household appliances and heating.Whether or not you can do this will depend on if you own your own property. Solar panels are more effective in houses with roofs, but some companies can install panels for apartments, too.Solar energy is renewable, and its panels -- also known as photovoltaics (PV) -- are a good source of cheap energy in many countries. The panels capture the sun's energy and convert it into electricity, which can be used to power appliances in homes directly or stored in a battery for later use. If some of that electricity is not used or stored, the excess power can typically be sold back to a central power grid. On a good run of sunny days, you could even make money from the energy you sell.The panels do not need direct sunlight to work, so they can still be effective on cloudy days, as solar radiation is still present. However, the stronger the sun, the more electricity will be generated.The Energy Saving Trust, a UK organization promoting energy efficiency, says a home solar PV system could cut electricity bills by up to 15-25% in the UK.In the US, the average household could save $260 a month using solar panels and battery storage. That's between $10,000 and $35,000 over 20 years, according to the energy market website EnergySage.Solar panels are able to provide power to run a heat pump (more on that below) and other household appliances, as well as directly for heating water and air.  \"This way, all of your space heating, water heating, lighting and appliances will use electricity, and solar PV will become well utilized in your house all year round. It's a zero-carbon set-up,\" he said. There are a number of factors that determine the cost of a solar panel system, such as the system size, equipment used, roof characteristics, labor involved in installation and location. According to Energy Sage, solar panels in the US cost about $20,474 for a 10 kilowatt (kW) system, which will give a large family home adequate power. On average, it takes seven to eight years to see a return on investment. But many countries, states or even local authorities offer subsidies, so you could break even much sooner. Heat pumps Workers install a heat pump in Folkestone, England. Energy experts CNN spoke to said the best way to reduce your carbon footprint at home is through the \"electrification of heat.\" In fact, \"electrify everything\" in general is a mantra for many advocates of climate action. That's because you can power most things now with electricity from clean, renewable energy sources, and that means less need for coal and gas for power, or oil for cars.So, what exactly are these heat pumps everyone is talking about? They are big boxes that sit outside and extract heat from the air, ground or water to funnel into a home. They typically use four times less energy than gas boilers. \"We need to get off gas, and the best way to do that is to switch to heat pumps. That way, you are completely removing gas from the property,\" said Ed Matthew, a campaigns director from European think tank E3G.The IEA said that doubling the current EU installation rates of heat pumps would save an additional 2 billion cubic meters of gas use in one year. This could also reduce a household's gas consumption by 90%. And as the EU imports most of its gas, that's an action that could greatly reduce reliance on Russia for energy.Heat pumps work particularly well in very cold climates. Nordic countries, including Finland, Sweden and Norway, have the highest heat pump installation rate in Europe, said Matthew.In the US, switching to a heat pump could save households an average of $557 a year on their home heating and cooling bills, according to a study conducted by energy research firm Carbon Switch.The pump itself and installation, however, can be expensive -- an average of around $10,000 -- so depending on your current heating system, it can be a while before you break even. But a lot of countries and states offer good rebates to install heat pumps, in which case, you'll start to see savings more quickly. In the UK, for example, grants of up to \u00a36,000 ($7,800) are available for new heat pumps. The average British household could save up to \u00a3261 ($340) a year by switching to one, according to analysis from the Regulatory Assistance Project (RAP), a Brussels-based not-for-profit group. That's significant, as annual energy bills are expected to rise by at least \u00a3600 ($780) after the government lifted a cap on prices so energy companies can survive the power crunch.Get better insulationAround one-third of all heat lost in an uninsulated home escapes through the walls.Depending on how old your building is, there's a good chance a lot of the heat is escaping your home through poorly fitted windows and poor insulation. This is a big problem in the UK, which has the oldest and \"leakiest\" housing stock in Europe, according to BRE, a UK environmental advisory group. To keep energy bills low and reduce carbon emissions, installing insulation is one of the most efficient and cost-effective ways to keep buildings warm.According to the UK Energy Agency if you live in a home with solid walls, rather than ones with cavities, up to 45% of your heat could be escaping through them. That's likely to be the same regardless of which country you live in.One way to improve the energy efficiency of our homes is to insulate them from the roof down to their foundation, E3G's Matthew said. Home insulation involves materials used to prevent heat from escaping or entering. \"There are different kinds of insulation measures,\" Matthew told CNN. \"Cavity wall insulation, loft insulation and draft-proofing are very cost-effective, while solid wall installation is much more complex and expensive.\" Cavity walls are insulated by a professional who injects materials into the cavity or space in the wall. Solid walls can be insulated from the outside -- a technique used to keep older homes warmer for longer.To insulate the roof, a mineral fiber material is laid between and over the joists. This material captures heat and prevents any drafts from getting in. Flooring can also be improved by laying down new insulation.Insulating water tanks, pipes and radiators, and draft-proofing using sealant, are other easy and quick ways to save money on energy bills.Around one-third of all heat lost in an uninsulated home escapes through the walls, while up to 25% can be lost through the roof. While the exact impact of insulation will differ between households, Rivers from the Carbon Trust says it could reduce heat demand by up to 50% in some cases. It's worth doing this before switching to renewable energy. Heat pumps, for example, are far more effective with robust insulation.Underfloor heatingUnderfloor heating is a cost-effective way to warm your home.OK, so this one involves tearing up your floors, but if you find yourself in a position to do that, underfloor heating is a great option. Historically considered a luxury, it's actually one of the most cost-effective and energy-efficient ways to heat your home.Underfloor heating operates at a lower temperature than standard radiators, it regulates heat in a larger space, it's quick to heat up a room and can retain heat for a good length of time after it's switched off.There are two main types of underfloor heating -- water-based and dry. Both can be powered using solar panels or wind turbines. Water-based underfloor heating uses heat pumps, while dry underfloor heating uses electricity and is easier to install than water pipes. But beware -- if your electricity comes mostly from coal or gas, this isn't a green option, and may not even save you much money.  Reducing reliance on Russian gas will not be simple, Matthew explains, but it's clearer now than ever that the world needs to use less natural gas.  \"The crisis in Ukraine is a wake-up call for the powers in the US and Europe to accelerate the transition away from gas. Not just for the climate, but for our energy security too,\" he said. Of course, if you rent or own an apartment, your options to make many of these changes may be limited. But you can always contact your landlord or building management to express your preference for cleaner ways of heating over natural gas. These measures should dramatically cut down your energy bills, too.",

Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, announced his opposition to the nomination on Monday, setting off a White House scramble to find Republican support in a 50-50 Senate.None materialized, rendering her nomination all but dead, even as White House officials continued to support the selection.Raskin's withdrawal was first reported by the New Yorker.In a statement on Tuesday, Biden said Raskin was qualified for the job and blamed partisan politics and attacks from special interests for her inability to gain support. \"Despite her readiness \u2014 and despite having been confirmed by the Senate with broad, bipartisan support twice in the past \u2014 Sarah was subject to baseless attacks from industry and conservative interest groups,\" Biden said. \"Unfortunately, Senate Republicans are more focused on amplifying these false claims and protecting special interests than taking important steps toward addressing inflation and lowering costs for the American people.\"Opponents, including Manchin, Senate Republicans and the US Chamber of Commerce, argued that Raskin's promotion of green energy, renewable resources and environmental issues threatened to keep gas prices high -- particularly at a time when the Russia-Ukraine conflict is sending fuel prices through the roof.On Monday, Manchin \u2014 who is not a member of the Senate Banking Committee that votes on Fed nominations \u2014 said Raskin's \"previous public statements have failed to satisfactorily address my concerns about the critical importance of financing an all-of-the-above energy policy to meet our nation's critical energy needs.\" Senate Republicans boycotted a vote last month in protest of Raskin's nomination, halting a slate of pending nominees for the central bank, including the renomination of Fed Chair Jerome Powell.Raskin's candidacy, however, was hailed by progressives. Biden has pledged to make the Fed more diverse in terms of both its gender and racial makeup and urged the Senate Banking Committee to confirm his other nominees, Philip Jefferson and Lisa Cook -- who would be the first Black woman to serve on the Fed's board.\"This group has the experience, judgment, and talent necessary to lead the Federal Reserve at this critical moment in our economic recovery, and the Senate should move their nominations forward,\" Biden said.",

        "content": "(CNN)Future allergy seasons will start more than a month earlier and be far more intense because of the climate crisis, new research shows.The study, published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications, found by the end of the century, pollen season could begin as much as 40 days earlier than it has in recent decades in the US because of global warming. Researchers also found annual pollen counts could climb by up to 250%.\"Pollen is something that is on people's radar because it influences their daily lives if you are allergic,\" Allison Steiner, author of the study and professor at the University of Michigan, told CNN. \"A huge component of the population is affected by these allergies, and people are really interested in understanding how [their allergies] might change so they can manage their symptoms better.\"Amazon near tipping point of shifting from rainforest to savannah,  study suggestsWhile there have been studies in the past pointing out how allergy season is getting longer and pollen concentrations are getting higher, Steiner -- who has two children suffering from allergies -- said their research is unique because it breaks down the individual types of pollens and tree sources by region, specifically analyzing a variety of plant sources including oak, cedar or ragweed. The timing of tree pollen is released -- especially in regions where there are a number of deciduous trees -- varies. For instance, in Michigan -- where Steiner lives -- birch trees typically pollinate first, then oak or pine, followed by other species over the course of a few months. Read MoreIn the future, though, the study found different tree pollen varieties that once varied in timing will eventually overlap with each other, leading to overall higher concentrations that threaten public health. \"Some people are allergic to certain pollen; some are not; and some have more allergenic proteins that can drive more allergies. If you're an allergy sufferer, you may or may not know what you're allergic to, depending on what kind of testing you've done,\" Steiner said. \"The [projected] higher concentrations of pollen is in addition to what you might be allergic to individually.\"Different tree pollen varieties that once varied in timing will eventually overlap with each other, leading to overall higher concentrations, the study suggests.Lewis Ziska, a plant physiologist and associate professor at Columbia University, suffers from allergies himself and carries a rescue inhaler at all times. He said the study extends the work that's already been done and makes clear the climate crisis will, at some point, exacerbate allergies, asthma and other public health problems.\"It's a very solid piece of science,\" Ziska, who is not involved with the report, told CNN. \"Looking at forecasting, particularly for both the high and low projections, it's a very good indication of the kind of impact that climate change can directly have with respect to people's health.Size of drought in US increased by the area of California in the past month\"I was impressed by the granularity of the study that it was looking at more on a very specific regional basis and also looking in regard to specific plant species,\" he added. Wind-driven pollen, which plays an important role in plant fertilization, is closely tied to temperature and precipitation changes. So as spring seasons get warmer earlier due to climate change, plants could pollinate much earlier and for a longer period of time than they currently do. Climate change also impacts the number of winter chill hours and spring frost-free days, which then affects the timing and duration of pollen season. As temperatures get warmer in the South and drought plagues the Southwest, pollen from plants like ragweed or poaceae -- a plant that typically grows on grassland or salt-marshes -- is projected to be higher across those regions than in the North.A longer and earlier start to pollen season could trigger a public health emergency, researchers say. More than 24 million people in the US experience pollen-induced respiratory allergies or hay fever, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While more research is needed in determining larger socioeconomic implications, Steiner said this could result in a large economic loss due to missed work, school days, medical expenses, and early deaths. 'Delay means death': We're running out of ways to adapt to the climate crisis, new report shows. Here are the key takeawaysA recent UN climate report emphasized greenhouse gas could be removed from the atmosphere by planting more trees and plants in green spaces, which could lead to an increase in pollen in those areas. But not all plants produce pollen. Steiner said as long as planners are careful of what trees to plant, people shouldn't worry about more trees intensifying pollen concentration. As the window to adapt to the climate crisis rapidly closes, Steiner said the projections could still be avoidable if the world reduces greenhouse gas emissions at a large scale, while simultaneously getting carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere to a manageable point. \"What happens between 2050 and 2100 really depends on human choices,\" she said. \"We're really hoping that's going to change. A lot [of us] in the climate community want to see those cuts, this concentration start to level off and hopefully start to have temperatures plateau, but a lot of work has to happen to make that change.\"",

        "content": "New York (CNN Business)Starbucks has a love-hate relationship with its cups. The company's white \u2014 or sometimes holiday-themed \u2014 logo-emblazoned paper cups for hot drinks, and clear plastic cups for cold drinks are instantly recognizable symbols of the brand. But that's not entirely a good thing. \"Our cup is ubiquitous, and we love that,\" said Michael Kobori, Starbucks chief sustainability officer. \"But it is also this ubiquitous symbol of a throwaway society.\" That's because the cups are disposable. When they are thrown away, the cups end up in landfills or as litter in streets and waterways. Some might be recycled, but recycling is an imperfect option \u2014 recyclable items still end up in landfills.The best solution? \"Eliminating the disposable cup,\" Kobori said. He called that option \"the holy grail.\"The traditional Starbucks disposable cup.Read MoreBy 2025, the company wants every customer to be able to either use their own mug easily or borrow a ceramic or reusable to-go mug from their local Starbucks. That could mean rolling out more borrow-a-mug programs that require a deposit. Starbucks is also planning, by the end of next year, to let customers use their own personal mugs at every Starbucks in the United States and Canada, even if they order ahead or use the drive-thru. The goals don't mean Starbucks will get rid of the paper and plastic cups. But they do want to make that option less attractive. That won't be easy to do, as most Starbucks customers are used to that simple, single-use option. But the company has a plan. Testing out Borrow-A-Cup programs  Examples of Starbucks' reusable cups. To phase out disposables, Starbucks is considering a widespread borrow-a-cup program, in which customers pay a deposit for a durable cup that they take with them and drop back off after use. Amelia Landers, a vice president of product experience whose team is responsible for sustainable packaging at Starbucks, expects that this model will resonate more with customers compared to other sustainability efforts. \"I think that will take the lead,\" she said. \"We are testing a number of different [borrow-a-cup] programs around the globe,\" including \"20 different iterations and in eight different markets.\" In Seattle, Starbucks tested a beta version of such a program last year.\"We developed a new cup that had a very low environmental footprint, was lightweight polypropylene, ultimately recyclable and could replace 100 single-use disposable cups,\" Landers explained. For that test, customers paid a $1 deposit, and had to return the cup to a smart bin located in the store to get their dollar back. Customers also earned rewards for using the cup.Kim Davis, who manages a store where the program was tested, said that customers were curious about the bin, and once baristas explained it to them, many were on board with the concept.  \"The excitement and engagement was really high among my customers and my [employees],\" she said. For baristas, the process was straightforward enough \u2014 they just used the reusable cup instead of a regular one to prepare drinks. A third-party company collected the dirty cups for cleaning, so baristas didn't have to worry about that part of the process. Starbucks (SBUX) is running similar pilot programs in Japan, Singapore and the United Kingdom.The model is the most promising because it's the easiest to integrate into customers' daily lives. You don't have to remember to bring your own reusable mug or, if you do, get stuck with a dirty cup for the rest of the day. And you don't need to sit and sip your coffee at a Starbucks, something most people don't have time for on a weekday morning. But that model is still just being tested, so the company wants to encourage the use of reusable mugs in other ways. Bringing back the personal cup  Starbucks wants all customers to be able to use reusable mugs and glasses at its stores. Early in the pandemic, when people feared that the coronavirus could spread easily on surfaces, Starbucks barred customers from bringing their own mugs. It has since brought back the option and is now trying out ways to make it more attractive. \"We're testing an incentive on the personal cup to go up from where it is today \u2014 from 10 cents to 50 cents,\" Landers said. \"We are also going to be testing a disposable cup fee.\" She added that the chain is also experimenting with discounted prices for people who use a Starbucks-provided ceramic mug in stores. That's simple enough. But it gets a lot more complicated when customers bring their own cups to the drive-thru or when they order ahead through the Starbucks app. Years ago, ordering ahead or using a drive-thru might have been a rare enough occasion. But since the pandemic, more customers have been coming through the drive-thru or ordering ahead.During a February analyst call, Starbucks CFO Rachel Ruggeri said that Starbucks' drive-thru windows and its mobile orders together account for about 70% of sales at US stores operated by the company.  So to achieve its zero-disposable-cups goal, Starbucks needs to figure out how to get reusables through a drive-thru, and make them available to customers who order ahead. To that end, Starbucks has been testing different options at its innovation center. \"We've got mock stores set up,\" said Landers. \"We have different versions of the drive-thru layout.\" Customers can simply give their cups to baristas at the drive-thru window. But Starbucks is exploring ways to make the process smoother. Pantene and Stubb's will be sold in reusable containers at some Kroger storesOne option is to allow customers to drop off their cups at an earlier point in the drive-thru lane so that the drink is ready in a personal cup once they swing around to the window, Landers said. Another is for baristas to pre-make drinks when customers place their orders, and pour them into personal tumblers at the window or when they arrive at a store to pick up their order. Starbucks is also testing out cup-washing stations in stores. The team is trying \"different things, over and over again,\" to figure out what might work, she said. \"We're right now in the middle of all of that work.\"It's crucial for Starbucks' mobile order and drive-thru experiences to be seamless. After just a few sluggish pickups, customers may take their business elsewhere.But Starbucks also has to be careful not to put too much additional burden on employees, who already have to prepare complicated, customized orders at high speeds. That's especially important now. Workers across the country are considering unionization, going against the wishes of the company's  leadership. A Starbucks, in Buffalo, New York, was the first to vote to unionize in December. Employees at a handful of other stores have since made similar efforts and several Starbucks around the country are preparing for their own votes.If the company's initiative leads to the end of paper and plastic cups at Starbucks, it will be quite an achievement.\"We know that even the most ardent of sustainability champion customers, they really don't change their behavior all that easily,\" Landers said. \"Even though they really, really want to.\"",

        "content": "LondonEnvironmental lawyers ClientEarth said on Tuesday they were preparing legal action against the directors of Shell over the company's climate transition plan, in what they said would be the first such case of its kind.The lawyers from ClientEarth \u2014 which is a Shell shareholder \u2014 said they are seeking to hold the oil and gas company's 13 directors personally liable for what they consider to be a failure to adequately prepare for the global shift to a low-carbon economy. They say that the board has failed to adopt and implement a climate strategy that aligns with the 2015 Paris Agreement, claiming that amounts to an alleged breach of the directors' duties under the UK Companies Act.ClientEarth said it had written to Shell notifying it of its claim and was waiting for it to respond before filing papers at the High Court of England and Wales. For the case to proceed, ClientEarth would then need permission from the court to do so.\"We believe that there are sufficient grounds to assert that Shell's board is mismanaging the material and foreseeable climate risk facing the company,\" said ClientEarth lawyer Paul Benson in a statement. \"Unless the board changes course, long-term value will be eroded, and eventually destroyed,\" he added.In a written response to Reuters, Shell said it was delivering on its global strategy that supported the Paris Agreement on climate, including by \"transforming our business to provide more low-carbon energy for customers.\"Read More\"Addressing a challenge as big as climate change requires action from all quarters. The energy supply challenges we are seeing underscore the need for effective, government-led policies to address critical needs such as energy security while decarbonizing our energy system. These challenges cannot be solved by litigation,\" Shell said.Court orders Shell to slash CO2 emissions in landmark climate rulingThe legal action comes less than a year after a Dutch court made a landmark ruling that Shell must dramatically reduce its carbon emissions. Shell is appealing that ruling.ClientEarth, a not-for-profit, has a track record of winning climate litigation cases. Last year it won a case against the European Investment Bank, in which the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled it had illegally avoided environmental scrutiny of its financing decisions. In 2020, the company Enea suspended construction of a coal plant in Poland after the group took it to court. The court ruled that authorizing the project was legally invalid. Energy companies are facing a challenge to their business model as countries look to cut use of fossil fuels, a major cause of human-made global warming, and reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century.Shell has pledged to halve the greenhouse gas emissions from its operations by 2030, but its plans to reduce emissions from the actual use of its products was not far-reaching enough, ClientEarth said. Shell's net-zero target was also not reflected in the company's operating plans or budgets, ClientEarth added.UN climate scientists have reiterated the need for faster global action and said failure to hit the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial norms would cause irreparable damage. The UK Companies Act would require Shell to act in a way that promotes the company's success, and to do so whilst exercising reasonable care, skill and diligence.ClientEarth said it was bringing the action as a shareholder in Shell on behalf of all stakeholders to help protect the long-term viability of the company.",

        "content": "A version of this article originally appeared in the weekly weather newsletter, which releases every Monday. You can sign up here to receive these every week and during significant storms.  (CNN)With 61% of the contiguous US in drought, wouldn't it be nice if we could just \"make it rain\" or just \"make more snow?\"Well, certain parts of the country are doing just that, sort of. It's called cloud seeding, and it's nothing new.It's been around since the 1940s and countries all over the world have been doing it for various reasons (most notably China), but it's a growing practice in the US, especially in the drought-stricken West.It's also surrounded with controversy.We spoke with Julie Gondzar who is the program manager for Wyoming's Weather Modification Program, who admits she gets lots of calls about what they are doing.Read MoreGondzar said some people say \"you're playing God,\" others say \"you are stealing moisture from the storm,\" making other areas drier than they normally would be, kind of like robbing Peter to pay Paul.There are also environmental factors to consider, as well as the cost-effectiveness versus the reward, which in the West these days water is liquid gold.\"Think about it like water storage, but in the winter on mountaintops,\" is how Gondzar described what cloud seeding is trying to achieve in her state, \"in a nutshell.\"Wyoming started cloud seeding in 2003 as part of a study. Then eight seasons ago, they started doing it in an official capacity after their 10-year study proved it works.This season, they have gone on 28 flight missions for cloud seeding in Wyoming. King Air's twin engine plane that is used for cloud seeding.She pointed out there are four weeks left in the season, so she is hoping for more opportunities before it winds down.  When you compare Wyoming to other states such as Utah and North Dakota, who have been cloud seeding since the '70s and '80s, the state is fairly new to the game.Cloud seeding uses an already existing cloud, and injects silver iodide into the cloud, which adds tiny particles called ice nuclei (which water needs to freeze).Clouds, in basic terms, are a collection of water droplets and/or ice crystals floating in the sky. The nuclei help the cloud produce precipitation, and artificial ice nuclei help create more precipitation than the cloud would produce otherwise.  It's done in two ways: One way is from the ground and the other is from the air, using silver iodide as the seeding agent.\"The ground-based generators kind of look like small weather stations, are like 20 feet tall, and they aerosolize into the atmosphere,\" Gondzar explained. \"But you have to wait for the right atmospheric conditions so that the plume goes over the mountain range.\" It makes seeding a little more tricky, because if the wind is blowing in the wrong direction, you'll completely miss your target.The most popular way is by plane, using flares. \"There are flares on the wing of the planes with silver iodide inside of cardboard casings and there are flares on the belly of the plane,\" Gondzar pointed out.This photo shows flares fixed on the aircraft's wing that house the silver iodide used for cloud seeding.Once the pilot flies into the storm, they ignite the cardboard casings full of silver iodide and \"seed\" the clouds. The result is more moisture in the cloud, resulting in more precipitation.The silver iodide \"is a natural salt compound,\" Gondzar emphasized. \"The reason it's used is because the geometric shape down to a molecular level is very similar to that of an ice crystal. And if you don't have that, you're not going to create additional ice crystals, which will then accumulate into snowflakes.\"But if you think you can bust the drought by using planes to modify the weather, Gondzar said think again. Is it working?\"Cloud seeding does not fix the drought,\" Gondzar said. \"You can't break a drought with cloud seeding. It's a tool in the toolbox.\"Gondzar admitted while they know the method makes more snow than they would otherwise receive, it's difficult to know exactly how much more they are getting.\"There's evidence of it in radar and all kinds of papers written,\" Gondzar noted. \"The question that they're trying to answer now is how well does it work? And that's a difficult question to answer. Because there's an abstract piece of this. There's really no way to know how much snow a particular system would have produced.\"She knows cloud seeding doesn't generate a lot of additional snowfall, but every little bit helps these days.According to Wyoming's Water Systems Data Map, some areas in the state are only at 60% of average for snowpack this season, and the window for additional snow is slowly closing as the season winds down.Since most of the West gets the majority of its water from snowmelt, she hopes what they are doing helps a tiny bit in the long term.\n\n\"It's a small incremental change over a long period of time. That's why consistency is important,\" Gondzar urged.She added at $28-$34 per acre foot, cloud seeding is relatively cheap. \"Those numbers tell us that this is an inexpensive way to help add water to the system. Essentially, we are creating a little bit of additional snowpack, that becomes additional streamflow in the spring and summer.\"But you need a cloud, to cloud seed. You can't just go out to the Mojave Desert and make it rain.\"This is not something that we can do out of thin air,\" Gondzar cautioned. \"The criteria is very specific for this to actually work.\"It can only be done within already existing clouds that were going to produce snow anyway and there has to be a certain temperature range.\"The silver iodide in the cloud is initiating that snow,\" Gondzar said. \"But you can't just make snow out of nothing. You have to have the supercooled liquid water in the cloud.\"She explained part of what made this year difficult was the much drier weather during the last month. There were fewer opportunities to cloud seed.\"A lot of people think it's manipulating the weather pattern,\" Gondzar remarked. \"We are essentially just playing with cloud dynamics and cloud physics, on a super, super-small scale.\"She is a meteorologist as well and points out the moisture from the weather systems come from much bigger areas like the Gulf of Mexico or the Pacific.\"There's always a huge stream of moisture that our systems are tapping into, and cloud seeding probably brings an additional one to 2% down to the surface.\"Playing God  While Gondzar is confident cloud seeding doesn't steal snow from another area, some scientists disagree. Daniel Swain is a climate scientist at UCLA and spoke with my colleague and climate writer Rachel Ramirez. He told her \"It is possible that you're actually stealing water from someone else when you do this, because it may be, at least on a regional basis, a zero-sum game where if water falls out of the cloud in one spot, it's even drier by the time it makes it downwind to the next watershed.\"\n\nHe went on to ask, \"To what extent are you just shifting around the spatial distribution of precipitation during a scarcity period rather than actually causing it to rain or snow more overall?\"He believes water equity issues need to be researched more.Another note of controversy has been the safety of the chemicals used in cloud seeding. Gondzar stressed it is not made of harmful chemicals like some people claim.She pointed out they did lots of testing for before they started officially cloud seeding and could not find any traces of harmful amounts of silver.\"There's silver in natural background levels in the water in the soil everywhere, on the surface of the earth,\" Gondzar noted. \"So you already have a natural background level of silver, it's been really difficult to find anything beyond background levels.\"She said the amount of silver iodide used is only a few grams at a time. What she's hoping is a small price to pay for bigger rewards down the road.There have been climate concerns surrounding cloud seeding. Here's more from Ramirez, who reached out to a few scientists, to get their take on cloud seeding's climate angle.  Climate scientists remain skeptical this is the silver bullet Although cloud seeding has been around for decades and is currently being operated in roughly 50 countries, many climate scientists remain skeptical of the technology's efficacy as well as the time and effort put into trying to manipulate weather.Swain pointed out it has been historically difficult to design scientific experiments to test the effectiveness of cloud seeding, leaving behind a trail of unclear, intangible evidence on what the benefits are.\"How do you know how much precipitation that might actually end up falling from that cloud occurred due to the seeding? Or how much would have fallen without the seeding?\" Swain told CNN. \"This isn't a setting where you can do a truly controlled experiment.\"Cloud seeding experiments typically deal with a narrow set of parameters, according to Swain, taking into account weather conditions including cloud cover, time of the day, and location. Additionally, the rapidly changing climate adds another layer to the list of variables. As the planet warms, weather patterns and clouds will constantly evolve, often in unexpected ways.That's what Sarah Tessendorf, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and other researchers from universities and an Idaho power company, set out to examine in 2017. Their results, published in 2020 in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences, managed to quantify how effective cloud seeding is. Yet uncertainties still linger.During the cold winter months in 2017, the researchers flew aircraft to inject silver iodine, the seeding chemical used, into clouds over the Payette Basin in Idaho, while simultaneously using radars and models to measure its impact on snowfall.In three cloud-seeding events, the scientists identified \"unambiguous seeding patterns,\" in cold cloud decks not producing ice at all; but once seeded, ice crystals formed inside mirroring the same pattern the aircraft had flown. They were then able to track the formed ice and snow to the ground and measure how much additional snow fell from the seeded clouds.Despite the results, Tessendorf said more experiments need to be done to improve the technology for it to become a sweeping solution to the climate crisis. The amount of precipitation produced by cloud seeding \u2014 up to 10% \u2014 isn't enough at all to quench the drought-stricken West.\n\n\"It could help over the years augment the storage levels in reservoirs, so that when you get into that extract, you might just go into that drought with a little bit more than you would have otherwise,\" she said. \"That to me is the way that cloud seeding should be viewed. It's not going to be the silver bullet, but it could be a helpful tool in a water manager's toolbox.\"When it comes to tackling climate change as a whole, many also question the methods such as the deployment of fossil fuel-powered aircraft to inject silver iodide into clouds, arguing it is counterintuitive to the overall climate goals of slashing fossil fuel emissions. But Tessendorf argued it is a small price to pay in order to improve the technology.\"I will say that the number of aircraft and the duration of these flights to do cloud seeding and the programs that are currently having it done pales in comparison to the number of commercial flights and aircraft we have in the skies all over the world right now,\" she contended. \"So it's to me a drop in the bucket of extra fossil fuels being burned.\"\"But that does not mean that there isn't room for improvement there in order to have more of a clean process,\" Tessendorf added.With the climate crisis accelerating, climate scientists like Swain say resources are much better invested in climate solutions already guaranteed to make significant and equitable impacts.\"There needs to be controlled studies that actually shows it was the seeding that increased the precipitation in a meaningful way,\" Swain asserted. \"The best case scenario is it's a small incremental adjunct to other water-saving or conservation measures during scarce periods, but even that's not clear if it would really work in that capacity in any systematic way.\"CNN meteorologist Judson Jones contributed to this article",

(CNN)Marine scientists have discovered deep sinkholes -- one larger than a city block of six-story buildings -- and ice-filled hills that have formed \"extraordinarily\" rapidly on a remote part of the Arctic seafloor.Mapping of Canada's Beaufort Sea, using a remotely operated underwater vehicle and ship-mounted sonar, revealed the dramatic changes, which the researchers said are taking place as a result of thawing permafrost submerged underneath the seabed. The changes the scientists observed occurred between 2010 and 2019, during which four mapping surveys had taken place, covering an area of up to 10 square miles (26 square kilometers). Mapping autonomous underwater vehicles detailed the unusually rough seafloor terrain along the edge of the continental shelf in the  Arctic. Sinkholes have developed where permafrost at depth has thawed. It's the first time an area of submerged permafrost, a frozen layer of Earth's surface, has been surveyed in this way, and it's not known how widespread similar changes are elsewhere in the Arctic. On land, thawing permafrost has led to radical shifts in the Arctic landscape, including ground collapses, the formation and disappearance of lakes, the emergence of mounds called pingos, and craters formed by blowouts of methane gas contained in the permafrost. These extreme features have affected infrastructure such as roads and pipelines. Read More\"We know that big changes are happening across the Arctic landscape, but this is the first time we've been able to deploy technology to see that changes are happening offshore too,\" said marine geologist Charlie Paull, a senior scientist at Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute and one of the lead authors of a study on the phenomenon published Monday in the peer-reviewed scientific journal PNAS. \"Clearly, such large changes would have significant implications for any infrastructure that might be placed on the seafloor. Currently, there is little infrastructure in this remote region of the Arctic. However, this may change as continued warming makes the region more accessible,\" he added.'Unexpected'About one-quarter of the land in the Northern Hemisphere is underlain by permafrost, Paull said, including large areas under the sea. This is because at the end of the last ice age around 12,000 years ago, large swaths of permafrost were submerged as glaciers melted and sea levels rose.In the 10-square-mile (26-square-kilometer) area of study, mapped in 2010 and again in 2019, the researchers found 41 steeply sided holes in the more recent mapping that weren't there before. The holes were roughly circular or oval-shaped and averaged 22 feet (6.7 meters) deep. The greatest change was a depression 95 feet (29 meters) deep and 738 feet (225 meters) long and 312 feet (95 meters) wide -- around the size of a city block made up of six-story buildings. The research team also found \"numerous\" hills, typically 164 feet (50 meters) in diameter and 33 feet (10 meters) high, that contained ice. They are similar to pingos -- ice-filled mounds found on land -- the study said.Surveys of smaller areas of the seafloor took place in 2013 and 2017, allowing researchers to understand the changes in finer detail.Repeated mapping surveys with autonomous underwater vehicles revealed a massive sinkhole developed over just nine years.Evgeny Chuvilin, a research scientist at Skoltech in Russia who has studied the Siberian permafrost, said it was surprising to see changes like these occurring in such a short span of time.Greenland's ice is melting from the bottom up -- and far faster than previously thought, study shows\"Permafrost degradation is a slow process. We're usually talking about centimeters per year. This here is more than merely degradation, it's also a qualitative change. So, I would say that yes, it is unexpected to see,\" Chuvilin, who wasn't involved in the research, said. \"Hypotheses had been voiced in the literature concerning the possibility of such processes, but this is the first time they have been directly observed.\"Rapid changesMassive craters have been discovered in parts of the Russian Arctic that formed when the buildup of pockets of methane gas in the ground spontaneously exploded. However, the Beaufort Sea researchers ruled out a similar origin for the marine sinkholes they discovered. The team didn't find rocks and earth on the seafloor that would have been scattered by such an explosion. Mysteries of massive holes forming in Siberian permafrost unlocked by scientistsPlus, brackish (slightly salty) water near the seafloor suggested the seawater was mixed with groundwater and the submarine permafrost wasn't a sealed system where overpressure could build up. Nor did they detect significant amounts of methane in the leaking groundwater.\"We do not have evidence that the rapid changes in this area are associated with explosive events,\" Paull said via email.The role of climate changeMany of the landscape changes seen on terrestrial permafrost have been attributed to warmer temperatures as a result of the climate crisis -- the Arctic is warming two times faster than the global average. However, the authors said the changes they'd identified could not be explained by human-caused climate change. \"Since this is the first study of the decay of submerged permafrost, we don't have long-term data for the seafloor temperature in this region. The data we do have aren't showing a warming trend in these waters 150 meters (almost 500 feet) deep,\" Paull said. Sprawling sponge gardens found deep beneath the Arctic sea iceInstead, the holes were likely caused by much older, slower climatic shifts that are related, he said, to our emergence from the last ice age and appear to have been happening for thousands of years. \"Heat carried in slowly moving groundwater systems is contributing to the decay of submerged permafrost, creating large sinkholes in some areas and ice-filled hills called pingos in other areas,\" Paull said.Water-filled cavities had replaced the excess ice that was once contained within the permafrost. When these cavities collapsed, the large sinkholes observed in this study were rapidly formed, he explained. The pingo-like mounds formed where the brackish water produced by the permafrost decay migrated upward and froze, blistering the seafloor with ice-cored mounds.While the temperature of the groundwater was unknown, if it was 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) above freezing, it could melt an ice column over thousands of years, the study said.Unlike land-based permafrost, which can respond on the scale of years to decades to climate change, subsea permafrost has a much slower response time in terms of climate impacts, said Sue Natali, Arctic program director and senior scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Massachusetts. \"Changes described in this study are responding to events that occurred over the centennial to millennial time frame. That said, these changes can still impact climate if they are resulting in emissions of greenhouse gases as the subsea permafrost thaws.\" Natali was not involved in the study.",

The lines you need to see from it are below.1. \"It's freezing out here. But we're gonna warm it up. We're gonna warm it up.\"\"Warm it up, Kris/I'm about to.\" And away we go!2. \"Just show the crowd. They never do it. They never do it.\"Read MoreThis is an oldie but goodie for Trump. He spent much of the 2016 -- and 2020 -- campaign insisting a) his crowds were massive and b) the media refused to show the crowds because they were so big. It has never been true that the media refused to show them.3. \"We had a big victory. And we actually had an honest vote count.\"Trump won South Carolina by 12 points over Joe Biden in 2020.  And he still hasn't proven that there was widespread fraud in any vote count in the country.4. \"He abolished our southern border.\"There's plenty of fair criticism of Joe Biden's border policy -- you can read some of it here. But one thing Biden didn't do is \"abolish\" the border.5. \"Millions and millions of people, many of them from jails from other countries, are being dumped into our country.\"[narrator voice] No, they aren't.6. \"There were more Covid deaths in 2021 then in all of 2020 and hospitalizations shattered every record even while Biden imposed illegal mandates all over the place.\"It's true that there were more deaths attributed to Covid in 2021 than 2020. But it's also worth remembering that Covid didn't hit in full force in America until March 2020. \n\n\n\n\n\n THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\n\n\n7. \"You can take the five worst presidents in American history and put them together, and they would not have done the damage Joe Biden has done in just 13 months.\"Who are the five worst US presidents, you ask? According to C-SPAN's 2021 survey of presidential historians, they are: James Buchanan, Andrew Johnson, Franklin Pierce, William Henry Harrison and -- wait for it -- Donald Trump.8. \"We have a president representing our country at the most important time in history, who is physically and mentally challenged.\"What evidence did Trump give that Biden is \"physically and mentally challenged?\" Oh, none.9. \"Russia would not have dared to annex one inch of territory if I was in the White House.\"It's not at all clear that Trump can make this claim. While he has repeatedly insisted that no one had been tougher on Russia as president than he had, there's little evidence to suggest that it's true. Also, not for nothing, Russia meddled in the 2016 election to help Trump.10. \"It was always 'America first.' Very simple, very simple. It's all about America first. It was also about 'make America great again,' but it was about America first because that's how you make it great.\"So, MAGA -- or something?11. \"I hate to do it, and I hate to tell you, but our nuclear weapons -- I rebuilt them and we have brand new -- and I hate to even mention it because the last thing we ever want to use is nuclear weapons.\"[narrator voice] He doesn't hate to tell you this.12. \"And you never want to use it, but the way you don't use it is by letting everyone know that we have it bigger and better, stronger than they do.\"Donald Trump on the possibility of using nuclear weapons: \"The way you don't use it is by letting everyone know that we have it bigger and better, stronger than they do.\"13. \"We got rid of ISIS 100%\"Nope! 14. \"We respected each other, but I said President [Xi], we're eating chocolate cake. And it was beautiful chocolate cake.\"Trump apparently told Chinese President Xi Jinping about American airstrikes in Syria in 2017 over chocolate cake. Oh, excuse me, over \"beautiful\" chocolate cake.15. \"I have to tell you, not that you go back to your beautiful room and say he never even told me that.\"\"Beautiful room.\" Much like the aforementioned cake.16. \"So he knew everything we were saying, so don't talk behind their back.\"In which Trump says he didn't think President Xi spoke or understood English, but then realized he did. Good preparation!17. \"But actually, my personality is what kept us out of war.\"\"Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!\"\" -- Donald Trump to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, in 2018. 18. \"And Adam -- Adam Kinzinger, you ever see him? He gets on television. He cries all the time. He starts crying.\"As far as I can tell, what Trump is referring to is the fact that the Illinois Republican congressman was near tears during a hearing with four police officers who were in the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. So, yeah.19. \"We call him Crying Adam Kinzinger.\"\"I call him Cryin' Chuck because I saw him cry one time while making a speech. I said, 'Isn't that sad? I've never seen him cry before.' I call him Cryin' Chuck.\" -- Donald Trump on Chuck Schumer, in 2019. And, yes, he is just recycling his old material at this point.20. \"We also have to clean out the rot of our failed foreign policy establishment.\"Say \"Deep State\" without saying \"Deep State.\"21. \"We have to continue to drain the swamp. We did a lot of it, but the swamp was deep, deeper than anybody believed.\"The biggest swamp in the world is the Pantanal, which is on the border of Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay. Information for life!22. \"You had somebody to talk to [Vladimir Putin] with me. Nobody was ever tougher on Russia than me.\"\"I hold both countries responsible. I think that the United States has been foolish. We've all been foolish. We're all to blame.\" -- Donald Trump on Russian meddling in the 2016 election. And, oh yeah, he was standing next to Putin in Helsinki when he said this.23. \"We break Elvis' records. We were in Texas, two weeks ago. ... They turned away 50,000 people.\"Yes, he is still talking about crowd size. In particular, the crowd at a rally at the Montgomery County Fairgrounds on January 29 of this year. The Houston Chronicle said the crowd numbered in the \"thousands,\" although there was no mention of 50,000 people being turned away.24. \"So we made a lot of really great stars sitting there.\"I think Trump is saying that the people who sat behind him at campaign rallies became stars because they were on television. So, yeah.25. \"Now Biden is crawling around the globe on his knees begging and pleading for mercy from Saudi Arabia, Iran and Venezuela.\"Remember when past presidents would refuse to make any public comment about their successor? Good times. Gooooooood times.26. \"The woman that thought of the Green New Deal didn't even go to a college to study.\"Trump appears to be talking about New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez here -- who went to Boston University and graduated in 2011 with a degree in international relations and economics.27. \"The world is going to be destroyed because the oceans are going to rise 1/100 of an inch within the next 300 years. It's going to kill everybody. It's going to create more oceanfront property. That's what it's going to do.\"Trump is mocking climate change activists here. If you know literally anything about science, it's not funny.28. \"The real threat we have is the nuclear threat.

        "content": "(CNN)A group of 89 House Democrats, including progressives and moderates, sent a letter to President Joe Biden Monday morning urging him to restart negotiations on a Democrat-only spending bill centered around climate action.The letter comes a few weeks after Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia opened the door for new negotiations by outlining what he wants to see in a Democrat-only spending bill. Manchin previously said he wants to pass tax reforms and measures to reduce the deficit but also said revenue from that should be put towards climate funding.Meanwhile, Democrats in the House want to start with policies that address the climate crisis.An 'excruciating year': Climate activists reset with Biden's agenda on life support  \"The more than $555 billion in climate investments in the House-passed Build Back Better Act can serve as the building block to restart negotiations,\" the groups of House Democrats wrote in their letter to Biden. \"Given the widespread agreement in the U.S. Senate for House passed climate provisions, we have an opportunity to recommence negotiations with climate serving as a key starting point.\"Reps. Sean Casten of Illinois, Jamaal Bowman of New York and Nikema Williams of Georgia led the letter. Members signing include Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Kathy Castor of Florida. Castor serves as chair of the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis.  Read MoreIt's unclear whether Manchin will want to replicate the $555 billion worth of clean energy and climate spending in Biden's original Build Back Better Act, or trim that figure down as well.There have been limited negotiations on a new spending bill, and most of that conversation has been driven by Senate committee chairs. House members are now urging Biden to take on a central role in restarting talks. \"Your leadership in these negotiations will ensure that we can pass on a safe, healthy, and vibrant society and planet to our children,\" members wrote. The lawmakers stressed that Biden cannot fail to act on climate change. \"Leading the world in limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius will require a monumental effort, and the climate components of Build Back Better are an indispensable foundation,\" the House Democrats wrote.\"It is clear that climate change is a threat multiplier to our economy. The longer we wait, the more expensive it will be to transition at the speed required, and we will have incurred billions in damages and harm to our communities, infrastructure, environment, and public health and safety along the way.\"",

It backs reports from the beginning of the Russian invasion that the island came under assault after its Ukrainian garrison rejected Russian surrender demands.The Ukrainian troops were all killed  -- and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said they would be \"awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine posthumously\" -- but later the Ukrainian military said they were \"alive and well\" and taken prisoner.JUST WATCHEDUkrainian Navy says soldiers who cursed out Russian warship are still aliveReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHUkrainian Navy says soldiers who cursed out Russian warship are still alive 02:59According to the Ukrainian Navy, the garrison on the island repelled two attacks by Russian forces but in the end was forced to surrender \"due to the lack of ammunition.\"A Ukrainian statement said that Russian attackers destroyed the island's infrastructure, including lighthouses, towers and antennas -- some of the damage that can now be seen in the new satellite photo.Read MoreIn the image, some of the red-roofed buildings in the island's center are shown to have been significantly damaged by Russian shelling.

        "content": "(CNN)In a year weighted by\u202fdisappointment for the US climate movement, the lowest low of 2021 might have taken place nearly 3,500 miles away in Glasgow, Scotland, where world leaders gathered early\u202flast\u202fNovember for the largest United Nations climate summit in history.\u202f  The UN's COP26 summit had been touted as an opportunity, however slim, to forge an off-ramp from climate catastrophe. Instead, negotiators walked away with another series of ambitious goals and commitments, with no mechanism for enforcement.\u202f\u202f  President Joe Biden \"was supposed to show up with Build Back Better in his back pocket and slam it down on the table and say, 'China, India, how do you like them apples?' climate activist and writer Bill McKibben told CNN, referring to Biden's ambitious climate and social policy package. \"But he showed up with nothing. And had nothing really to say.\"\u202f  The story of Washington's failure so far to move major climate legislation with Democrats in full control of government is one fraught with slim congressional majorities, rising economic inflation and the breakout of war in Europe. Underlying it all is what climate activists see as major legislative missteps. Biden was the first president to center his administration around the threat of climate change, but major progress has proved difficult to achieve. The new year has brought unexpected and heightened complications. The global crisis set off by Russia's invasion of Ukraine has further scrambled the politics of clean energy. Biden's move to ban oil imports from Russia, which is expected to cause even higher gas prices, has the American fossil fuel industry primed to increase output. And though some clean energy advocates are hopeful the squeeze will inspire renewed investment in renewable sources, the administration has been focused in recent days on discussing how to get more oil on the market, which has included the highest-level discussion with Venezuela in years and encouraging increased production from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Read MoreEven before war seized Europe, Congress's inability to take the steps scientists agree would offer a baseline for curbing, if not reversing, the climate crisis and sending a statement to other high-polluting countries is a maddening one for a movement that came within spitting distance of a generational victory. 'We really don't have a plan': Biden's climate promises are sunk without Build Back Better, experts sayIn Glasgow, Biden arrived with the framework of a climate and social spending package the White House said all House and Senate Democrats -- including pro-coal Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia -- had agreed to.  But as the international conference took place, Democratic leaders in the US House of Representatives allowed for the passage of a $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill that -- as many on the left had predicted when they sought to tie it to the Build Back Better plan -- all but eliminated pressure on Manchin to back the President's signature proposal.\u202fA month later, Manchin announced his opposition to the Build Back Better bill, effectively killing it in a 50-50 Senate, where every Democratic vote would be needed for passage. In the months since COP26, the already fragile climate credibility of the US has been thrown further into doubt. Build Back Better is \"dead,\" Manchin declared in February. And even though Biden's climate provisions are one of the few things in the original bill he's publicly expressed support for, they have\u202flittle momentum behind them.\u202f\"We threw everything we had at this moment\"  Varshini Prakash, executive director of the Sunrise Movement, a youth-led climate activist group, was among those who had worked for years to create the circumstances for federal action on climate. In an interview, she reflected on what she described as \"this last, laborious, excruciating year.\" \"We threw everything that we had at this moment,\" Prakash said. \"We got people out to vote for a candidate (in Biden) they weren't that excited about. We elected climate champions., We did action after action. We showed up at the debates. We pressured people to increase their ambition. We even sat in on policy formations\" that secure a beefed-up climate platform for Biden's 2020 campaign. For Prakash and many other activists, Manchin, along with another Democratic holdout on Build Back Better, Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, has emerged as the central villain in the story.\u202f\u202f  \"There was so much that young people did in the last two to three years to set the stage for climate action at the federal level,\" Prakash said. \"And I think in this moment, it's just very hard to see the way in which all of that has been whittled down to one man standing in the way of that action.\"  The Sunrise Movement is an early winner in the Biden transition. Now comes the hard part.There is also some frustration among advocates the President's recent actions. \"It does seem like since then, Biden tried to go back to the old way of doing things,\" Evan Weber, a co-founder of Sunrise, told CNN. \"He forced progressives to break their block on passing the bipartisan infrastructure bill, and other things that show a naivete about American politics for a guy who has seen a lot of transformation in the way the Republican Party and the national media operates.\"  White House officials take exception to that narrative.   \"From Day One, the President has spurred an all-systems-go effort to take on the climate crisis -- one that harnesses an all-of-government approach,\" Ali Zaidi, deputy White House national climate adviser, told CNN.He pointed to the administration's climate-related successes such as phasing out super-pollutants, turbo-charging offshore wind development in federal waters, tightening fuel mileage standards and enacting funding for a nationwide electric vehicle charging network.The long path to a stalemate The Sunrise Movement arrived unannounced.\u202f\u202f  On a November morning in 2018, days after Democrats won a sweeping House majority in the midterm elections, young activists from the group staged a sit-in in once and future House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office on Capitol Hill. They had a simple demand: \"Back the Green New Deal,\"\u202fan ambitious agenda for reducing carbon emissions over a decade and recreating the American economy and social safety net in the process.\u202f  Fifty-one people were arrested by the time Pelosi's office was cleared and the group's specific request, to resurrect a select committee on climate change, had been mostly brushed aside. (A lesser version of what Sunrise envisioned was eventually formed.) But over the next two years, the organization would emerge as the preeminent force in American climate activism, a siloed and often incoherent movement that had for decades operated on the fringes of official Washington.\u202f  Within days of the sit-in, the Green New Deal became a rallying cry for a new generation of progressive activists, who saw it as the only viable off-ramp on the road to further climate disaster.\u202f\u202f  Early in 2019, freshman Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York -- the youngest woman elected to Congress -- formally introduced the Green New Deal resolution.\u202f\u202f  \"The goal was to create a movement that would elevate climate change to one of the top three to five issues in our country,\" Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ed Markey, who introduced the resolution in the Senate, told CNN.\u202f\u202f Facing a climate crisis, these youth activists stay focused on solutionsSupport for the program quickly became a litmus test for ambitious Democrats in the runup to the 2020 presidential election -- as the party's progressive grassroots sought to reassert itself after Donald Trump's election and, in a broader scope, after a decade of deference to more cautious and technocratic-minded party leaders. \u202f  The stage was set and Sunrise, a group McKibben described to CNN as \"the best combination of far-reaching, idealistic and politically pragmatic that I've almost ever seen,\" nailed their lines. Aligned with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, Sunrise and its allies successfully set the bar for climate policy in a field that would eventually swell to more than 20 candidates.\u202f\u202f  When a climate adviser to Biden suggested to Reuters in a May 2019 interview that carving out a \"middle ground\" on climate was the only feasible policy-making route, the movement swarmed. At a Sanders rally at Howard University in Washington, Ocasio-Cortez declared, \"I will be damned if the same politicians who refused to act are going to try to come back today and say we need a middle-of-the-road approach to save our lives.\"\u202f\u202f\u202f  The remark, which set off chants of \"No middle ground\" inside the packed hall, prompted Biden into a defense of his record. A spokesman for Sunrise at the time offered a more measured appraisal: \"We're nervous about where (Biden) stands ... but there's time for him to do the right thing.\"\u202f  Eleven months later, the moment arrived.\u202f\u202f  All but defeated after Biden scored a decisive victory in the South Carolina primary before cleaning up on Super Tuesday and consolidating support from the primary field, Sanders dropped out of the race. Biden, whose climate platform Sunrise graded as \"F-\" early in the primary, would be the Democratic standard-bearer in the campaign to unseat Trump and, if he succeeded, the chief agenda-setter in Washington.\u202f  Biden was a willing listener on climate, David Kieve, a top campaign climate adviser, told CNN. Clean energy investment was of personal interest to the former vice president -- who had managed the 2009 Obama stimulus package and seen how its investments spurred renewables development in the US. Biden wanted to find a way to marry climate action with a message on delivering middle-class union jobs, according to Kieve.\"He also understood that if we were going to turn a corner and sell climate to the American people in a way we never have before, we needed to be really explicit in connecting it to the jobs piece,\" said Kieve, who later served as director of public engagement at the Council on Environmental Quality in the Biden White House and is now president of climate advocacy group EDF Action. \"Labor was treated as a partner rather than an interest group.\"The Biden campaign, sensing a need to engage and energize young progressives, forged an alliance with Sanders and his allies. Most notably, they formed task forces designed to close the gap on a number of issues on which the candidates had clashed. Climate, ultimately, produced the most coherent set of goals and fostered a sense of partnership between Democrats' establishment and progressive wings. After Biden won the presidency, Democratic lawmakers moved swiftly to pass the American Rescue Plan, a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 stimulus package. The legislation included billions for public transit, a win for climate advocates, but the real test lay ahead -- and the memory of false dawns from more than a decade ago sharpened the minds of veteran Democratic lawmakers. Biden touts one-year anniversary of American Rescue Plan in PhiladelphiaMarkey told CNN that the last major Democratic push on climate, a 2010 cap-and-trade bill that bore his name, failed in part because \"we did not have a movement outside to ensure it would get passed through the Senate.\" Markey still believes the movement around the Green New Deal is the missing piece.  Recent history has shown it is more complex. The barriers imposed by the coronavirus pandemic, leading activists told CNN, have blunted the movement's energy and taken many of its most passionate supporters off the streets. Now, the legislative path forward, if one exists, sits largely in the hands of Manchin and Sinema and a possible resurrection of Build Back Better. Or, as it's now called: \"Building a Better America,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said\u202fearlier this month.  \"No one cares about the name in the American public,\" Psaki said. \"They care about what's in it and what it's going to do. And so that's what we're most focused on.\"  Biden and Democrats consider their options Increasing public and governmental attention, however, on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and domestic\u202finflation at home, has pushed climate legislation to a tenuous position in Congress. And outside efforts to squeeze financial institutions out of the fossil fuel industry and encourage divestment -- a direction some in the movement have pivoted toward -- are complicated by worries of an energy crisis tied to the European conflict. On the legislative front, Manchin appears to be nudging along a process he previously halted. Climate is one of the few things in Biden's agenda that has survived Manchin's red pen. The West Virginian outlined a potential deal to CNN that could include allowing the government to negotiate prescription drug prices and raising taxes on the rich and corporations. The new revenue, he said, could be directed to climate investment. For now, though, it's just scattered discussions and sound bites. Conversations on a path forward are happening among Senate committee chairs, but, even with Manchin's latest gesture, a cohesive framework for a new bill remains far off.\u202fAnd Manchin, in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has pushed for boosting fossil fuel production and infrastructure immediately.There's new momentum in Congress for a climate bill, but a lot of questions on what it could includeWith the clock ticking until 2022 midterm campaigning picks up in earnest this summer, climate groups are feeling anxious.  \"Where we are right now as a climate movement is feeling pretty panicked, I would say,\" Christy Goldfuss, senior vice president for energy and environment policy at the Center for American Progress, told CNN recently. \u202f  Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee, who campaigned for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination on a climate platform, said Congress and the administration cannot wait too long and suggested passing the Build Back Better climate provisions as a standalone package.\u202f  \"I would certainly defend, embrace, even advocate for getting that done tomorrow,\" Inslee told CNN. \"It'd be wonderful to get these other things done as well, but if it means you're waiting till next September to think you're going to get climate through two weeks before the election ... I am very concerned that that is not going to be a successful strategy.\"\u202f  The White House maintains it is continuing to push every lever it can -- both on the legislative side and with executive action and federal regulation to meet Biden's emissions target and spur job creation. \u202f  A White House official, while acknowledging that climate advocates' role is to continue to push for more, emphasized that the White House climate office is pushing a lot of smaller policy changes across the administration -- infusing them with environmental justice and climate considerations.\u202f  And even if full climate investments of Build Back Better are passed, that would only be the beginning, some Democrats say. \u202f  \"We have to get as much done as we can get every year,\" Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii told CNN, \"and whether it was a good year or a bad year realize we're nowhere near where we need to go yet.\"",

(CNN)As humans, we can't seem to help leaving traces of ourselves behind everywhere we go. And some of these artifacts are bigger than others. In South America, there is a wall of rock art created by early humans 8 miles (13 kilometers) in length that serves as a record of when Homo sapiens arrived from Africa.By contrast, the International Space Station is 356 feet (109 meters) from end to end. And in 2031, it will fall to Earth and become another piece of space junk resting in watery Point Nemo. Just like the archaeological investigations of early human sites, there are efforts underway to illuminate what life has been like aboard the space station through space archaeology.The very first experiment began in January and will come to an end later this month. The findings could show how humans have turned the floating laboratory into a unique home -- and preserve the cultural heritage of a habitat beyond Earth before it slips beneath the waves. Read MoreAnd this week, we explore another vestige of human exploration, found deep beneath the wild waters at the world's edge.Ocean secretsThe stern of the Endurance, with the name and emblematic polestar, can be seen at its final resting place underwater.The HMS Endurance, the ship of polar explorer Ernest Shackleton that sank in 1915, has been discovered intact off the coast of Antarctica. Shackleton and his crew set off from the UK in 1914. But when they reached McMurdo Sound, the ship became stuck in the thick ice of the Weddell Sea. The crew was forced to abandon the ship and eventually reached a Norwegian whaling station. The ship is resting 1.9 miles (3,008 meters) beneath the sea. Now that Endurance has been found, she can be studied and photographed while the story of her great journey continues to be shared.Wild kingdomThis spider is anything but itsy-bitsy. And if you live in the southeastern US, chances are you've already seen a Jor\u014d spider tending to its massive sticky web.These giant arachnids can reach about the size of the palm of your hand or larger, and they have distinctive color patterns of black, yellow and gray.But there is nothing to fear. The spiders may be venomous, but researchers say they pose no threat to humans.Experts believe the spiders could rapidly spread into the Northeast this year because they can survive in colder climates. How the spiders reached the US from their original home in southeastern Asia remains a mystery, but these crawlers are effective travelers and can even create their own parachutes.A long time agoThis South American rock art stretches for miles and may depict extinct creatures.About 12,000 years ago, South America was home to car-size giant ground sloths, elephantlike creatures and deerlike animals with trunks.Fossils aren't the only remnants telling the tale. The dramatic story of these ice age beasts is thought to be preserved in a frieze of rock paintings created by early humans in the Colombian Amazon rainforest. The depictions reveal the diversity of animal life that migrating Homo sapiens may have encountered when they entered this unusual landscape.To some, the idea that the paintings show now extinct creatures is considered controversial because they could be interpreted as modern animals. But researchers are conducting an investigation that could solve the mystery once and for all.ConsequencesThe Amazon rainforest may be letting us know it's reaching the tipping point. The lush ecosystem, home to unique species of animals and plants, may become a grassy savannah. Three-quarters of the rainforest show signs of \"resilience loss\" because the Amazon is struggling to recover from droughts, fires and logging. The world's largest tropical rainforest is critical to Earth's health because it stores a tremendous amount of carbon and even influences global weather patterns. New research suggests that if the rainforest crosses the environmental threshold, it could disappear within decades. Fantastic creaturesThe adult male rose-veiled fairy wrasse looks like a living rainbow.The ocean's \"twilight zone\" is full of gems, like the rose-veiled fairy wrasse, a striking species new to science.The rainbow-hued fish was found living at ocean depths ranging from 131 to 229 feet (40 to 70 meters) around the Maldives. While hundreds of species thrive in the waters near and surrounding the archipelago nation, this is the first fish to be described by a Maldivian scientist. During recent dives, researchers found more of this fairy wrasse -- as well as at least eight potential new fish species -- living deep beneath local recreational diving zones. ExplorationsConsider us intrigued: -- Our sun's activity is ramping up -- like this massive solar flare caught on video on March 2 -- and two solar missions are poised to witness every moment.-- The oldest ancestor of modern octopuses lived 328 million years ago and had 10 arms, according to new research. The fossil was so well preserved that scientists could see the suckers on each arm.-- A wolverine sighting was captured on video this week in Yellowstone National Park. The rare creature was seen galloping in the snow.Like what you've read? Oh, but there's more.

It is the largest portion of the country in a state of drought since 2012, the year when the continental US saw an all-time record of 65% during September.And in recent weeks, drought has increased significantly. In the last month alone, the percentage of the continental US in drought has jumped from 55% to more than 61%, an increase of nearly 170,000 square miles; an area larger than the size of California.Why record-high gas prices won't be solved by drilling more oil in the US\"The drought is pretty baked in,\" Justin Mankin, assistant professor of geography at Dartmouth College and co-lead of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Drought Task Force, told CNN. \"My expectation is fully that the American West is going to be in a drought through the rest of this year, at the very least.\"\"To recover from this thing, we're talking about multiple seasons of above-average precipitation,\" Mankin added.Read MoreBut across many parts of the West, precipitation has \"flatlined\" since the beginning of the new year, scientists told CNN. California's snowpack, which had been at 160% of normal in December, is down to around 90% due to the lack of new accumulation and some midwinter melting. A recent snow survey from the state Department of Water Resources (DWR) showed reservoirs across the state will likely not fill up again this year.\"Barring any unforeseen miracle March, which we don't actually see coming, we will end this year below average,\" Sean de Guzman, manager of the Snow Surveys and Water Supply Forecasting Program with the DWR, previously told CNN.\n\nThe same forecast is shaping up to be the case for the Colorado River basin. For the first time since it was filled more than 50 years ago, Lake Powell, the second-largest reservoir in the country, is projected to dip past a critical threshold, threatening water supplies and putting a key source of hydropower generation at heightened risk of being forced offline.The US Bureau of Reclamation told CNN it is currently anticipating water levels in Lake Powell to reach a significant elevation of 3,525 feet above sea level sometime in the next week. Drought contingency plans define the 3,525-foot mark as a significant \"target elevation\" for the reservoir, under which the situation becomes dire.Lake Powell is about to drop below a critical level never reached before, as drought rages onWhile the West continues to see much drier conditions than the rest of the country, this week's US Drought Monitor emphasized \"the southern Plains and South continue to dry out.\"\"As spring approaches and dormancy is broken, impacts are already showing in these areas and drought intensification is widespread with quickly expanding extreme and exceptional drought areas,\" it noted.As the planet warms, drought and extreme heat will also fuel deadly fires. Multiple studies have linked planet-warming emissions and high temperatures to increased acreage of burning across the West, particularly in California.On the other side of the country, the Bertha Swamp Road Fire is raging across the Florida Panhandle, and has moved through land covered by \"thick, dry, and dead trees and vegetation left behind from Hurricane Michael,\" the Florida Forest Service said.\"Fire is one of the early impacts of the dryness,\" the Drought Monitor explained, noting the Florida fire and several others across the state as well as Georgia in recent weeks. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, the country has seen more than double the normal amount of fires and area burned. Through the end of last week, 8,349 fires were recorded, the most at this point in the year in at least a decade.Globally, UN scientists found droughts that may have occurred only once every 10 years or so now happen 70% more frequently due to climate change. In the US alone, it has drained reservoirs, triggered water shortages, and primed the landscape for deadly wildfires. Scientists say what the country has experienced in the past several years is just a preview of what's to come, unless the world cuts its reliance on fossil fuels and finds ways to quickly adapt to the crisis.

        "content": "(CNN)On Wednesday, former President Donald Trump sat down with the \"Full Send\" podcast for nearly an hour. Why? Who knows! (It does have more than 1 million YouTube subscribers and the likes of Donald Trump Jr. and MAGA favorite Candace Owens have appeared on it.) During that conversation, the topic of Ukraine -- and Russia's invasion -- came up. Which led to this exchange between host Kyle Forgeard and the 45th president:Forgeard: \"What do you see happening next then? 'Cause it seems like the tensions are high. How does this all end? Is this going to be like a long-term thing? How do you see it unfolding?Trump: \"Well, and I said this a long time ago, if this happens, we are playing right into their hands. Green energy. The windmills. They don't work. They're too expensive. They kill all the birds. They ruin your landscapes. And yet the environmentalists love the windmills. And I've been preaching this for years. The windmills. And I had them way down. But the windmills are the most expensive energy you can have. And they don't work. And by the way, they last a period of 10 years and by the time they start rusting and rotting all over the place, nobody ever takes them down. They just go on to the next piece of prairie or land and destroy that.\"This is not a joke. That is actually what he said. You can watch it for yourself here.Read MoreWhen asked how Russia's invasion into Ukraine ends, the former President of the United States went into a riff on windmills and how they don't work. Yup.While that is super weird given the question he was asked, it's not an uncharacteristic riff for Trump. He's been consistent on very few things in his life, but his hatred of windmills -- as I laid out recently here -- is definitely one of them.A quick bit of history: When Trump bought land in Scotland to build a golf course and resort, he opposed a plan to build wind turbines on the country's coast. \"I want to see the ocean, I do not want to see windmills,\" Trump said in 2006.In a speech to the Scottish Parliament in 2012, Trump went further. \"I am an expert on tourism,\" he said. \"If you dot your landscape with these horrible, horrible structures, you will do tremendous damage. ... Many countries have decided they don't want wind, because it doesn't work without massive subsidies, it kills massive amounts of birds and wildlife, and there are lots of other reasons.\"Trump eventually lost that fight, as 11 wind turbines were built in 2018. Trump also frequently criticized windmills during his presidency. In a 2019 speech to House Republicans, Trump said: \"If you have a windmill anywhere near your house, congratulations, your house just went down 75% in value. And they say the noise causes cancer.\" (I can't believe I have to say this, but the noise from windmills does not, in fact, cause cancer.)Later that same year, Trump went on another rhetorical screed against windmills. \"I never understood wind. You know, I know windmills very much,\" Trump said. \"They're noisy. They kill the birds. You want to see a bird graveyard? Go under a windmill someday. You'll see more birds than you've ever seen in your life.\"So, yeah. He really doesn't like windmills.What was Trump trying to say in his response on Ukraine on Wednesday? If I had to guess, he wanted to talk about how America has to become more energy independent -- a point on which he and President Joe Biden agree -- so they aren't dependent on oil from countries like Russia and Iran. And that that process of energy independence has been slowed by liberals who are pushing for \"green energy\" rather than more fossil fuel-driven energy.  But, man, there are a whole lot of elisions of thought in Trump's answer. Just major logic gaps and, you know, explanations for what he is saying. All I know is that he thinks windmills are bad. Like, really bad.",

        "content": "(CNN)As US oil and gasoline prices skyrocket, politicians in both parties have called for a seemingly easy solution: Drill our way out of the problem to ease prices at the pump and supply additional energy to Europe. \"The president must end his war on American energy,\" Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said in a recent statement. \"Republicans have been demanding the administration take the shackles off American energy producers since President Biden took office. We have the energy at home and we must use it.\" But the US is already the world's top producer of crude oil, producing about 11.6 million barrels of oil per day as of December -- and that supply is increasing, energy experts told CNN. The country is also the world's largest consumer of oil, using about 21 million barrels per day in 2019 -- 20% of the world's total. Why US gas prices are at a record and why they'll stay high for a long timeBuried under US soil lies an estimated 38.2 billion barrels worth of proven oil reserves that are still untapped, according to the US Energy Information Administration. But there's a big impediment to the US using that oil: It tends to be lighter and different from the heavier imported oil we currently rely on.  The idea that the US can be fully energy independent -- and that it would combat rising gas prices -- is a fantasy, numerous experts told CNN. Read More\"What Americans and US officials really care about is the price of gasoline, and that has almost nothing to do about whether we're energy independent or not,\" said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group. \"Can the US wall itself off from volatility in the global oil market? The answer is no.\" It's too early to tell whether the current price shock will spur a change in how Americans consume oil, but experts said it's forcing a hard look at how the country uses it.  \"The issue the US is grappling with from a security standpoint -- we're dependent on oil,\" Sam Ori, executive director of the University of Chicago's Energy Policy Institute, told CNN. \"The idea that if we produce more oil in some way it would help with that problem -- it's just not true.\" Why more drilling won't curb gas prices There are many reasons for this, but the biggest one is that oil is truly a global commodity, experts told CNN. The global price of oil determines gas prices in the US, and it's impossible to divorce that price from the shifting global dynamics. \"Energy markets are global, the oil market even more so than natural gas,\" said energy analyst Rachel Ziemba. \"It's not really realistic, in my mind, to close [the US] off and be energy independent and say, 'Sorry, guys, we're independent and we don't care about you.' \" The push to ban Russian oil is gaining steam. Here's what that means for US energy pricesThe US gets the vast majority of its imported crude oil from Canada (4 million barrels per day), Mexico (492,000 barrels per day) and Middle East oil giants like Saudi Arabia and Iraq (a combined 695,000 barrels per day). Organizations like OPEC+ have a huge influence on prices, which fluctuate due to production targets. Oil prices were already rising before Russia's war in Ukraine, because Saudi Arabia and Russia were producing less fuel than they promised, CNN reported.  \"Everybody pays the same price for crude oil,\" said McNally.  There's also the fact that the US consumes a different kind of oil than it produces. McNally likened the kind of light crude the US produces to champagne, and the heavy crude it imports to coffee.  Importantly, US oil refineries are built to refine this \"heavy and gunky\" imported crude -- akin to separating out coffee grounds, McNally said.  \"Even setting aside the complexities related to crude qualities and refinery diets/configurations and the role of biofuels, the US still needs to import oil as domestic supplies still sit below its gigantic oil demand, despite growing tremendously in the past 10 years,\" Claudio Galimberti, an oil markets expert and senior vice president of analysis at Rystad Energy, told CNN via email. Oil pumpjacks in the Inglewood Oil Field in Los Angeles, California. The oil the US produces is not the same kind that it is set up to refine.Natural gas presents a different picture; unlike Europe, which is largely dependent on Russia for its natural gas supply, the US produces nearly all of its natural gas at home. In fact, one of the short-term fixes to help Europe detach from Russian gas is increasing liquid natural gas shipments to Europe from the US. Turn down the heat to stop Putin? Europe wrestles with its Russian gas addictionBut McNally said the concept of \"energy independence\" doesn't matter for most Americans; what matters are the prices at the pump. There are also stark climate change implications to new drilling: Last year, the International Energy Agency said no new oil and gas projects should be approved if we intend to keep the global temperature increase below 1.5 degrees -- a critical threshold that scientists warn the planet should stay under. President Joe Biden, Democrats in Congress and climate advocacy groups have also called for the US to boost the domestic production of renewable energy like wind and solar and to shift the auto industry and consumers toward electric vehicles. If most consumers were driving electric vehicles, gas-price shocks wouldn't hit so hard. \"Even if we supplied our entire oil and gas needs today domestically, we'd never have full control over the price because Putin's actions factor into the price,\" Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico told CNN. Heinrich said cleaner technologies like electric heat pumps and electric vehicles \"sever that influence.\" Biden's oil and gas permitting at pace with Trump's Republican lawmakers in particular have blasted the Biden administration for what they have characterized as an energy agenda that prioritizes climate and clean energy action over fossil fuel drilling. \"This is about replacing Russian oil with American and North American resources that this administration has stifled -- let's face it -- in its executive order on public lands, its decision to stop Keystone,\" Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio said recently. \"There are things we can do to get our production back up to where it was.\" Chevron Phillips will pay nearly $120 million to clean up 3 chemical plants after allegations it violated Clean Air ActThe Biden administration has indeed put more of an emphasis on developing renewable energy. Its offshore wind development goal, for example, is far beyond what the Obama administration had set out to achieve. But even with its clean energy priorities, the Biden administration's oil and gas permitting numbers have so far kept pace with the early years of the Trump administration.  The Biden administration approved 3,537 permits to drill in its first year, more than the number issued by the Trump administration in each of its first three years, according to a CNN analysis of Bureau of Land Management drilling permit data. The Trump administration approved 2,658 permits in 2017, 3,332 in 2018 and 3,415 in 2019 before accelerating the number of approvals to 5,367 in 2020. Biden paused new oil and gas leasing at the start of his administration, but that pause is long gone after a federal judge in Louisiana blocked it. And the most recent delay in oil and gas permitting is the result of a lawsuit brought by Republican state attorneys general.Now the administration is caught between its short-term goal of easing gas prices and its long-term goal of installing more clean energy and vehicles and cutting carbon emissions. \"I think what they're trying to do now is to recognize that there is a near-term goal of reducing global reliance on Russian energy,\" Ziemba said. \"That both means finding additional supplies of oil and gas from other jurisdictions, including at home, just as it means conservation and consumption changes and additional deployment of cleaner energy.\"",

(CNN)Far beneath the waves surrounding the Maldives, there's a living rainbow in the ocean's \"twilight zone.\" Say hello to the rose-veiled fairy wrasse, a colorful species of fish that's new to science.The fish, which bears the scientific name Cirrhilabrus finifenmaa, was found living at depths ranging from 131 to 229 feet (40 to 70 meters) beneath the ocean's surface. The name honors the fish's stunning pink hues, as well as the pink rose, the national flower of the Maldives. \"Finifenmaa\" means \"rose\" in the local Dhivehi language.The waters of the Maldives are home to a hundreds of species of fish.While hundreds of species thrive in the waters near and surrounding the archipelago nation, this is the first fish to be described by a Maldivian scientist -- Ahmed Najeeb. A study describing the fish published Tuesday in the journal ZooKeys.\"It has always been foreign scientists who have described species found in the Maldives without much involvement from local scientists, even those that are endemic to the Maldives,\" said study coauthor Najeeb, a biologist at the Maldives Marine Research Institute, in a statement. Read More\"This time it is different and getting to be part of something for the first time has been really exciting, especially having the opportunity to work alongside top ichthyologists on such an elegant and beautiful species.\" A fish by any other nameThe fish has a history of mistaken identity. Researchers first found it in the 1990s, but they thought it was an adult belonging to Cirrhilabrus rubrisquamis, or the red velvet fairy wrasse. This different species had only been described from a single juvenile fish found 621 miles (1,000 kilometers) south of the Maldives in the Chagos Archipelago. Wrasses, a family of largely bright colored fishes, have been known to change in color as they transition from juveniles to adults, said senior study author Luiz Rocha, the California Academy of Sciences curator of ichthyology, in an email.While the juveniles of many species look alike, it's the adults who carry distinguishing characteristics, he said.The scientific name Cirrhilabrus finifenmaa is a nod to the pink rose, the Maldivian national flower.\"A few months ago, Yi-Kai Tea (our first author) received (remotely operated vehicle) footage from Chagos showing adults, which were very different from the adults from the Maldives,\" Rocha said. \"That's when we decided that the species from the Maldives was new and different from C. rubrisquamis.\"In their study, the researchers focused on the details of adults and juveniles, analyzing the height of the spines supporting their dorsal fins, counting scales and cataloging the colors of the adult males.The rose-veiled fairy wrasse adult males have a unique color pattern including bright magenta, peach, orange-pink and dark purplish-red. Discovering that finifenmaa and rubrisquamis were two separate species can help scientists understand the range of these fish, which becomes especially important when trying to protect them.(From left) Ahmed Najeeb and Luiz Rocha inspect some fish they collected during a recent expedition in the Maldives.\"What we previously thought was one widespread species of fish, is actually two different species, each with a potentially much more restricted distribution,\" said lead author Yi-Kai Tea, a University of Sydney doctoral student, in a statement. \"This exemplifies why describing new species, and taxonomy in general, is important for conservation and biodiversity management.\" The name may be new, but the rose-veiled fairy wrasse is already a target of the aquarium hobby trade.\"Though the species is quite abundant and therefore not currently at a high risk of overexploitation, it's still unsettling when a fish is already being commercialized before it even has a scientific name,\" said Rocha, also a codirector of the California Academy of Sciences Hope for Reefs initiative. \"It speaks to how much biodiversity there is still left to be described from coral reef ecosystems.\" Exploring 'twilight zone' reefsThe Hope for Reefs initiative aims to research and restore coral reef systems. Last month, researchers from Hope for Reefs and the Maldives Marine Research Institute surveyed some of the Maldives' twilight zone reefs. These reefs can be 160 to 500 feet (50 to 150 meters) beneath the ocean's surface and provide a unique environment for fish like fairy wrasses.A fish called Wakanda: New purple fish honors 'Black Panther'\"It's a really different environment: It's darker (because the water functions as a filter absorbing light, so the deeper you go, the darker it gets) and colder,\" Rocha said. \"There are much fewer corals, and almost no algae (because of the lack of light), so the fish community is very different and most fish at this depth feed on plankton (tiny marine invertebrates that live in the water column).\"The recent dives, funded by an award from Rolex, show just how difficult it is to survey the largely unexplored twilight zone reefs -- located below recreational diving limits. The divers must use rebreathers and helium mixed into the gas they breathe to avoid the negative effects of breathing oxygen under so much pressure, in addition to using an abundance of gear that requires a lot of training, Rocha said. But it's well worth it, according to the researchers.\"Diving there is like visiting another planet,\" Rocha said. \"We are always the first ones to see those reefs, and always find new species. It is very challenging, but also very exciting!\"Divers prepare to explore the twilight zone reefs of the Maldives during a recent expedition.During the recent surveys, the research team found more of the rose-veiled fairy wrasse as well as at least eight potential new species of fish.The California Academy of Sciences and the Maldives Marine Research Institute are continuing their partnership to explore more Maldivian reefs in the future.\"Our partnership will help us better understand the unexplored depths of our marine ecosystems and their inhabitants,\" Najeeb said. \"The more we understand and the more compelling scientific evidence we can gather, the better we can protect them.\"\"We hope to collect a few more specimens of the other eight new species we recently found,\" Rocha said. \"Additionally, we are closely working with our Maldivian partners to keep using Maldivian names in our species.\"",

(CNN)The age of a 31-kilometer (19-mile) wide meteorite crater discovered under a kilometer of Greenland ice had long puzzled scientists.The Hiawatha crater was exceptionally well preserved despite glacier ice being incredibly effective at erosion. Its state fueled talk that the meteorite might have hit as recently as 13,000 years ago.  However, the crater, which is one of the world's largest, has now been definitively dated -- and it is much, much older. In fact, it slammed into the Earth just a few million years after dinosaurs went extinct, about 58 million years ago.\"Dating the crater has been a particularly tough nut to crack, so it's very satisfying that two laboratories in Denmark and Sweden, using different dating methods arrived at the same conclusion. As such, I'm convinced that we've determined the crater's actual age, which is much older than many people once thought,\" said Michael Storey, head of geology at the Natural History Museum of Denmark, in a news release. When the asteroid hit, the Arctic was covered in balmy rainforest with temperatures of around 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius). Local inhabitants would have included crocodiles, turtles and primitive hippo-like animals, said Storey, who was an author of a new paper on the crater published in the journal Science Advances.  Read MoreThe Hiawatha impact crater could swallow up Washington DC and is larger than about 90% of the roughly 200 previously known impact craters on Earth. The researchers collected sand and rock samples in Greeland to determine when the meteor hit. It's not yet known whether the meteor that struck Greenland disrupted the global climate in the same way the 200-kilometer wide asteroid that created the Chicxulub crater in Mexico -- that doomed the dinosaurs -- did some 8 million years earlier. But the Greenland meteorite would have devastated plant and animal life in the immediate region. To date the glacier, researchers collected sand and rocks from rivers flowing from the glacier. Those samples would have been heated by the meteor impact. They were dated using techniques that detect the natural decay of long-lived natural radioisotopes contained in the rock. Crystals of the mineral zircon contained in the rock were dated using uranium-lead dating. The uranium isotopes start decaying as zircon crystallizes, transforming into lead isotopes at a steady and predictable rate.  The technique pointed to a date of about 58 million years ago. The grains of sand were heated with a laser, and the researchers measured the release of argon gas, which is produced from the decay of the rare but naturally occurring radioactive isotope of potassium, known as K-40.\"The half-life of K-40 is exceptionally long (1,250 million years) which makes it ideal for dating deep-time geological events like the age of the Hiawatha asteroid,\" Storey said.The technique suggested a similar time frame for the meteor strike. \"It is fantastic to now know its age.

It is also allowing other states to adopt California's stricter standards in lieu of the federal rules.This move officially reverses a Trump-era action that had revoked the Golden State's authority to set its own vehicle emission standards, amid an environmental battle between the Trump administration and the state. In 2019, the Trump administration rolled back California's decades-old waiver that had allowed it to set its own air pollution standards.The EPA signaled last month that the move was coming.Biden administration rolls out new regulations and funding for cleaner trucks and buses\"Today we proudly reaffirm California's longstanding authority to lead in addressing pollution from cars and trucks,\" EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement. \"Our partnership with states to confront the climate crisis has never been more important. With today's action, we reinstate an approach that for years has helped advance clean technologies and cut air pollution for people not just in California, but for the U.S. as a whole.\"In 2021, President Joe Biden issued an executive order on public health and the climate crisis, which included instructing agencies to review the Trump-era fuel emissions action, known as SAFE-1.Read MoreAs part of Wednesday's announcement, the EPA has decided to rescind the SAFE-1 action, the agency said. As a result, the waiver granted to California \"to implement its Advanced Clean Car (ACC) program in 2013 is back in force,\" according to an EPA fact sheet.In rescinding the SAFE-1 action, the EPA said Wednesday, it is \"withdrawing the SAFE-1 interpretation of the Clean Air Act that would prohibit other states from adopting the California [greenhouse gas] emission standards,\" according to the fact sheet.  This means other states are now allowed to adopt California's emission standards in lieu of federal standards, in accordance with the Clean Air Act.\"When you clear a traffic jam, the first thing you do is take your foot off the brake. That's exactly what the Biden Administration is doing by reinstating California's long-standing authority under the Clean Air Act to set tailpipe standards and allow other states, like Delaware, to adopt them,\" said Democratic Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware, who chairs the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.Chevron Phillips will pay nearly $120 million to clean up 3 chemical plants after allegations it violated Clean Air ActCalifornia Air Resources Board member Daniel Sperling previously told CNN the state won't use its waiver to implement stronger standards for cars and light trucks, and the state will instead implement Biden's national EPA standards, which will increase the fuel mileage rule for cars and trucks to 40 miles per gallon by the 2026 model year.Where California will likely go further than the federal government is in standards for heavy-duty trucks, Sperling said. \"I would say California wants everyone to go forward fast\" on zero-emission vehicles, Sperling said. \"If you look at political realities, the attitude is yes, we have to be the leader because the feds are not, and other states are not following fast.\"Biden's national climate adviser, Gina McCarthy, said in a statement that Wednesday's announcement along with the EPA's new tailpipe rules \"provide the opportunity for the Biden-Harris Administration and the State of California under Governor Newsom's leadership, to once again move forward in the direction of a harmonized national program that will benefit families all across America.\"The increase of fuel mileage standards -- nationally and in California -- plays a pivotal role in Biden's climate agenda. Transportation emissions account for nearly 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions. The new national standards will prevent billions of tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere, according to the EPA.\"In addition to helping us meet our climate goals, this action will reduce pollution in communities across the country, save Americans money at the gas pump, and strengthen our nation's energy independence,\" said Carper.CNN's Ella Nilsen contributed to this report.",

It is the largest earthquake ever to hit Japan.Number of people killed and missingRead More(Source: Japan's Fire and Disaster Management Agency)The combined total of confirmed deaths and missing is more than 22,000 (nearly 20,000 deaths and 2,500 missing). Deaths were caused by the initial earthquake and tsunami and by post-disaster health conditions.Other FactsAt the time of the earthquake, Japan had 54 nuclear reactors, with two under construction, and 17 power plants, that produced about 30% of Japan's electricity (IAEA 2011).Material damage from the earthquake and tsunami is estimated at about 25 trillion yen ($300 billion).There are six reactors at Tokyo Electric Power Company's Fukushima Daiichi plant, located about 65 km (40 miles) south of Sendai. A microsievert (mSv) is an internationally recognized unit measuring radiation dosage. People are typically exposed to a total of about 1,000 microsieverts in one year.      The Japanese government estimated that the tsunami swept about five million tons of debris offshore, but that 70% sank, leaving 1.5 million tons floating in the Pacific Ocean. The debris was not considered to be radioactive. READ MORE: Fukushima: Five years after Japan's worst nuclear disasterTimelineAll times and dates are local Japanese time.

The total evacuated so far is about 185,000.- 50,000 Japan Self-Defense Forces personnel, 190 aircraft and 25 ships are deployed to help with rescue efforts.- A government official says a partial meltdown may be occurring at the damaged Fukushima Daiichi plant, sparking fears of a widespread release of radioactive material. So far, three units there have experienced major problems in cooling radioactive material.March 14, 2011 - The US Geological Survey upgrades its measure of the earthquake to magnitude 9.0 from 8.9. - An explosion at the Daiichi plant No. 3 reactor causes a building's wall to collapse, injuring six. The 600 residents remaining within 30 kilometers of the plant, despite an earlier evacuation order, have been ordered to stay indoors. - The No. 2 reactor at the Daiichi plant loses its cooling capabilities. Officials quickly work to pump seawater into the reactor, as they have been doing with two other reactors at the same plant, and the situation is resolved. Workers scramble to cool down fuel rods at two other reactors at the plant - No. 1 and No. 3.- Rolling blackouts begin in parts of Tokyo and eight prefectures. Downtown Tokyo is not included. Up to 45 million people will be affected in the rolling outages, which are scheduled to last until April.March 15, 2011 - The third explosion at the Daiichi plant in four days damages the suppression pool of reactor No. 2.

(CNN)The oldest ancestor of modern octopuses lived 328 million years ago and had 10 arms, according to a new study. Researchers have named the previously unknown species Syllipsimopodi bideni after US President Joe Biden.The creature's discovery pushes back the time frame when vampyropods, the group to which cephalopods like octopuses belong, appeared in the ocean by almost 82 million years.The study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.World's deepest octopus, complete with Dumbo ears, captured on film 4 miles below the surfaceVampyropods are known for having eight legs, an internal shell made of chitin and a soft body -- the last of which doesn't show up often in the fossil record because it tends to deteriorate more quickly than hard structures like bone. A well-preserved fossil was discovered in Montana's Bear Gulch Limestone formation and donated to Canada's Royal Ontario Museum in 1988. The specimen represents the earliest-known ancient relative of these creatures, a new analysis of the fossil revealed. Read More\"This is the first and only known vampyropod to possess 10 functional appendages,\" said study author Christopher Whalen, a postdoctoral researcher in the American Museum of Natural History's Division of Paleontology, in a statement.The exceptionally well-preserved vampyropod fossil is located at the Royal Ontario Museum in Canada.\"All previously reported fossil vampyropods preserving the appendages only have eight arms, so this fossil is arguably the first confirmation of the idea that all cephalopods ancestrally possessed ten arms.\"Syllipsimopodi is the best known fossil for understanding how vampyropods originated, as well as helping researchers to trace their evolution, said Whalen, who is also a National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellow in Yale University's Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences. It has long been thought by researchers that the vampyropods began with 10 arms and eventually lost two of them over time -- and now, scientists have direct evidence.Tiny but mightyThe detailed fossil clearly shows a creature about 4.7 inches (12 centimeters) long with 10 arms, with the suckers still attached -- an incredibly rare find since these arms were essentially just muscle. Two of those arms seem to be longer than the other eight, and its body was shaped like a torpedo, similar to modern squid. The researchers also found remnants of its ink sac.Soft-bodied cephalopods are divided into vampyropods and decabrachians. Vampyropods include octopuses and vampire squids, both of which are different from actual squid. Vampire squid basically look like octopuses with a built-in parachute because they have a membrane that stretches between and connects their arms. They also have two structures to help them feed called filaments in addition to their eight arms. Do octopuses dream? Maybe. But they definitely change colors while they sleepMeanwhile, decabrachians include modern squids and cuttlefish, which have 10 arms, including 2 tentacles. There are a number of differences that separate cephalopods like squid and octopuses, but the number of arms is one of the most recognizable.So why is this fossil considered to be a vampyropod, even though it has 10 arms?The team's phylogenetic analysis, which indicates evolutionary relationships, placed the species within the vampyropod side of the evolutionary tree, Whalen said. The new species also had several key anatomical traits that mark it as a vampyropod, including the loss of a chambered cephalopod shell used to regulate buoyancy, called a phragmocone, which is seen in existing creatures like nautilus.\"The age makes the fossil very significant -- it indicates that vampyropods (and by extension decabrachians) are much older than was previously thought (at least 82 million years older),\" Whalen said. \"It indicates that there is a long interval of time during which fossil vampyropods must have existed but have not yet been found.\"What's in a nameSyllipsimopodi likely used its longest pair of arms to capture prey and the rest of its shorter arms to hold small creatures and pry them from their shells. It also had fins, which probably helped it maintain stability and swim.\"Syllipsimopodi may have filled a niche more similar to extant squids, a midlevel aquatic predator,\" said study coauthor Neil Landman, a curator emeritus in the American Museum of Natural History's Division of Paleontology, in a statement. The team was surprised to discover that Syllipsimopodi had a gladius, or the tongue-shaped and semitransparent part of a cephalopod's internal shell.How octopuses taste their meals by touching them, according to a new study\"The gladius functions to provide structural support, as a rigid structure that the muscles can pull against, and as an anchor for the fins (the overall function is similar to our bones),\" Whalen wrote in an email. \"A gladius is considered a rather advanced feature in the grand scheme of cephalopod evolution. Today, only squids and their relatives, and vampire squid, have a gladius. Octopods have reduced it to a fin support or stylets, which are small, hard, bar-shaped structures.\"The creature's genus name, Syllipsimopodi, is a nod to the Greek word \"syll\u00edpsimos,\" meaning \"prehensile,\" and \"p\u00f3di\" for foot because it's the oldest cephalpod discovered so far to have suckers on its arms. And the species name, bideni, is in honor of Biden, who had just been inaugurated when the study was first submitted for publication. \"I was encouraged by the plans President Biden put forward to counter anthropogenic climate change, and his general sentiment that politicians should listen to scientists,\" Whalen said.",

(CNN)The Amazon rainforest may be nearing a critical tipping point that could see the biologically rich and diverse ecosystem transformed into a grassy savannah. The fate of the rainforest is crucial to the health of the planet because it is home to a unique array of animal and plant life, stores a huge amount of carbon and strongly influences global weather patterns.Scientists say that about three quarters of the rainforest is showing signs of \"resilience loss\" -- a reduced ability to recover from disturbances like droughts, logging and fires. Their study is based on month-to-month observations of satellite data from the past 20 years that has mapped the biomass (the area's organic material ) and the greenness of the forest to show how it has changed in response to fluctuating weather conditions.This decreasing resilience since the early 2000s is a warning sign of irreversible decline, the authors said. While it isn't possible to tell exactly when the transition from rainforest to savannah might happen, once it was obvious, it would be too late to stop. 'Delay means death': We're running out of ways to adapt to the climate crisis, new report shows. Here are the key takeaways\"It's worth reminding ourselves that if it gets to that tipping point and we commit to losing the Amazon rainforest, then we get a significant feedback to global climate change,\" Timothy M. Lenton, one of the authors of a new study and a director of the Global Systems Institute at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom, told a news briefing. Read More\"We lose about 90 billion tons of carbon dioxide mostly in the trees but also the soil (of the Amazon),\" Lenton said. If the Amazon is no longer a rainforest, it won't store as much carbon.Aerial view showing a boat speeding on the Jurura river in the municipality of Carauari, in the heart of the Brazilian Amazon Forest, on March 15, 2020. Previous studies based on computer simulations have reached similar conclusions about an ecological point of no return for the Amazon rainforest -- but the authors said their research, published in Nature Climate Change on Monday, used real world observations. Once we reach the tipping point, the authors said the rainforest could disappear fairly quickly. \"My hunch, for what it's worth, (is that) it could happen in the space of decades,\" Lenton said.The study found that loss of resilience was most stark in areas closer to human activity as well as those that received less rainfall. The study also noted that loss of resilience does not equate to a loss in the area of forest cover -- meaning that the rainforest could be close to the point of no return without clearly determinable changes. The climate crisis is messing with birds' body shapesChantelle Burton, a senior climate scientist at the Met Office Hadley Centre in the UK, said that there had been a question mark over how the Amazon rainforest would stand up to the challenges of climate change, land-use change and fires. She said this new study was \"really important.\"\"What this study does is offer some observational-based evidence for what is already happening to this significant carbon sink, and shows that human land-use and changes to weather and climate patterns are already driving an important change in the system,\" Burton, who wasn't involved in the research, told the Science Media Centre in London. \"Passing a tipping point of this kind would make it even more difficult to achieve our goal of Net Zero emissions globally because of the loss of the \"free service\" provided by the Amazon carbon sink which currently removes some of our emissions.\"Richard Allan, a professor of climate science at the University of Reading, said the study was a \"a comprehensive and rigorous assessment of the durability of the Amazon.\"\"It reaches the tantalising conclusion that much of the Amazon is showing signs that it may be approaching a tipping point towards irreversible decline; but because multiple satellite sensors are used to infer the 'lushness' of the vegetation, we need to be sure those data records are showing accurate trends,\" Allan was quoted by the SMC statement as saying.\"In any case, it is undeniable that human activities are waging a war of attrition from multiple sides against the natural world, though thankfully in this case the solutions are known: to cease deforestation while rapidly and massively cutting greenhouse gas emissions.\"",

The fuel will be repositioned in \"a few locations,\" Kirby said.Navy agrees to halt operations at a Hawaii fuel facility tied to tainted water after military families got sickThe fuel facility sits 100 feet above the Red Hill aquifer, which supplies drinking water to Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam and other parts of Hawaii. Nearly 1 million people on Oahu rely on it for water, according to the Hawaii Board of Water Supply.On November 28, the Navy shut down the well after reports of people on base suffering nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches and skin-related problems. More than 4,000 families were relocated from their homes, according to the Pentagon.Read MoreTesting revealed petroleum hydrocarbons and vapors in the water, the Navy said.

Closing Red Hill meets that commitment,\" he said.The Defense Department will also create an \"environmental mitigation plan\" to address any future contamination concerns, Austin said.\"We will continue our work with the Hawaii Department of Health, national and local elected officials, and other community leaders, to clean up the water at the Red Hill well. And we will develop an environmental mitigation plan to address any future contamination concerns,\" he said.Hawaii's state health department ordered the Navy in December to halt operations at the fuel storage facility. The department also demanded the Navy install a drinking water treatment system at the Red Hill well; submit a plan to assess system integrity; and defuel the Red Hill underground storage tanks within 30 days of corrective action, Gov. David Ige said.The Navy initially said it would contest the health department's order but would pause operations. In January, the Navy agreed to follow the health department's order.The fuel facility supports US military operations from all branches of service in the Pacific, according to the Navy.Built during World War II, the Red Hill facility could store up to 250 million gallons of fuel in 20 steel-lined underground storage tanks encased in concrete.A history of fuel leaksRecords show a history of fuel leaks plaguing Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in the past decade, with the most recent leak occurring 11 days before the Navy announced it had discovered contamination in the Red Hill well.Another incident in May involved the release of more than 1,600 gallons of jet fuel from a pipeline inside the storage facility, according to the Navy.\"An investigation determined that operator error caused the release of 1,618 gallons of jet fuel (JP-5) from a pipeline inside the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility (RHBFSF) on May 6, 2021,\" the Navy said. \"The release was not from the fuel tanks.\"In October, the Hawaii Department of Health cited the Navy for violations related to operation and maintenance of the facility, records show. The fines and violations resulted from a routine inspection from September 28, 2020, through October 9, 2020, according to the health department.The Notice of Violation and Order consisted of five counts with a total penalty amounting to $325,182, the Hawaii Department of Health said in a news release.In the release, the health department said the five counts were:Failure to operate and maintain ongoing corrosion protection to metal components of the portion of the Navy's tank and piping that contain regulated substances and are in contact with the groundFailure to perform line tightness testing of repaired piping before return to serviceFailure to perform an annual liquid tightness test on spill prevention equipment to prevent releases to the environmentFailure to perform an adequate visual walkthrough inspection of hydrant pitsFailure to maintain adequate release detection for two double-walled underground product recovery storage tanksIn January 2014, during the refueling of a tank, the Navy identified a fuel release estimated at up to 27,000 gallons of JP-8 jet fuel, according to the Hawaii DOH.The US Navy \"subsequently drained the tank and collected samples from existing monitoring wells.

        "content": "Abu Dhabi, UAE (CNN)A revival of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal appeared to be imminent by the end of last week. The main parties to the talks indicated that an agreement was close, until an unlikely hurdle emerged.  Russia, which has largely stood by Iran in its conflict with the West, said Saturday that its own national interests would have to be taken into account for a deal to go through.  The warning came after Tehran said on Friday it had agreed a roadmap with the UN nuclear watchdog to resolve outstanding issues, suggesting that talks were close to conclusion.  The surprise Russian move demonstrates how far Moscow is willing to go to use its leverage in faraway conflicts to pressure the West while it wages war on Ukraine, even at the risk of displeasing its allies in Tehran. It also shows Russia's realization that the United States needs a nuclear agreement now more than ever to find a replacement for disruption to Russia's crude supplies on the global market. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said Monday that his country would not \"allow external factors\" to affect their national interests in the talks. Read MoreIn a phone call later on Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told Amir-Abdollahian \"that the resuscitation of the JCPOA should ensure that all its participants have equal rights regarding the unhindered development of cooperation in all areas,\" the Russian embassy to Iran said, using the acronym for the 2015 nuclear deal. France warned Russia not to resort to \"blackmail.\" US getting closer to reviving Iran nuclear deal but officials warn efforts could still failA restoration of the 2015 nuclear agreement between world powers and Iran could see over a million barrels of sanctioned Iranian oil coming back to the market. Russia's warning came as the US said Sunday that it is exploring banning imports of Russian oil with its European allies in response to the invasion of Ukraine. Brent crude climbed near $139 a barrel after the announcement, its highest since 2008. Lavrov said Russia wanted a written guarantee from the US that Moscow's trade, investment and military-technical cooperation with Iran would not be hindered in any way by Western sanctions on Moscow. \"Both Russia and China were written into the JCPOA to handle specific elements,\" said Trita Parsi, vice-president of the Quincy Institute in Washington, DC. \"Some of the low enriched uranium was supposed to be shipped out to Russia\" and some of that activity could fall under the new sanctions the US is imposing on Russia, he said. Russia's demands could be legitimate, said Parsi, but they could also be a pretext to delay a new agreement with Iran. Western sanctions could significantly curtail Russia's oil exports but they would drive global prices even higher as the US grapples with high inflation. That would make the need for alternative sources of crude more urgent for Western states. Moscow supplies 8% of the world's oil. Iran would quickly be able to raise its output to 3.8 million barrels per day if sanctions are lifted, Oil Minister Javad Owji said last week. It pumped 2.4 million barrels per day on average last year. \"That will take pressure off the US and add pressure on the Russians, whose only export [to the West] at this point is gas and oil,\" said Parsi. \"At a minimum it seems the Russians want to delay it. At a maximum they may actually want to scuttle it altogether.\" Western states need more oil on the global market to bring inflation under control domestically. But they also see it as a tool to make the Ukraine war costly for Russia. Oil income accounted for 36% of Russia's total budget last year and rising crude prices have only helped fill the state's coffers, fueling the war. Russia's new demands come as Moscow and Tehran grow distant on some global matters. Iran abstained from a vote at the United Nations General Assembly condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine last week. Its Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei earlier refrained from condoning his ally's actions, opting instead to condemn NATO's expansion. Iran's UN abstention came after Russia voted in favor of a United Arab Emirates-backed Security Council resolution sanctioning the Iran-allied Houthi rebel group, after previously abstaining from a similar vote. Other top Middle East news Yemen's Houthis sign deal with UN to offload decaying oil tanker  Yemen's Houthis on Saturday said they had signed an agreement with the United Nations to deal with a decaying oil tanker that has been stranded on the country's Red Sea oil terminal for six years. Background: The Safer has been stranded on Yemen's Red Sea oil terminal of Ras Issa for more than six years, threatening to spill 1.1 million barrels of crude oil off the war-torn state's coast. Why it matters: The decaying tanker is an environmentally disastrous ticking bomb. The UN has warned it could spill four times as much oil as the 1989 Exxon Valdez tanker spilled off Alaska's coast. Last month, the UN said there was an agreement in principle to move oil from The Safer onto another ship, but no timeline was given.   Global financial crime watchdog adds UAE to 'grey' list  The UAE on Friday was added to Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF)'s 'grey' list, subjecting the Middle East business hub to closer monitoring for possible money laundering. Background: The UAE has emerged as the region's business and gold trading hub, attracting some of the world's wealthiest individuals. It has recently taken steps to combat its image as a center for illicit money, especially after a 2020 FATF assessment that called for \"fundamental and major improvements\" by the UAE.  Why it matters: The Gulf nation is trying to position itself as a competitive economy to attract global investment and talent. The listing by FATF could be a hurdle in those efforts. UN envoy urges end to oil blockade on two oilfields as daily output slashed The UN's envoy to Libya Stephanie Williams on Monday urged the country's National Oil Corporation to lift the force majeure imposed on two oilfields, saying that \"blocking oil production deprives all Libyans of their major source of revenue.\" Background: Libya's NOC said it had to impose a force majeure on Libya's El Feel and Sharara oilfields after a pipeline valve shut down, resulting in the loss of 330,000 barrels per day (bpd), and over 160 million dinars ($34.69 million) on a daily basis. Why it matters: Libya's oil output is one of its sole remaining sources of revenue. Production has been repeatedly halted over the country's past tumultuous decade. The global oil market is already gravely undersupplied, with crude prices soaring to their highest since 2008. Around the regionEgyptian female judges sit at the State Council in Cairo, Egypt, on March 6. Female judges on Saturday took the bench for the first time at Egypt's State Council, a landmark event that finally brought women to top court positions in the male-dominated Arab country.  Last year, a presidential decree saw 98 women sworn in as judges to the council for the first time since the council's establishment in 1946. The appointment took effect on Saturday.  There is no law that bans women from taking high-level judicial positions in Egypt, but women's applications have been rejected for decades at higher ends of the judicial ladder. The council repeatedly rejected female applicants until last year's decree, said the state-owned Al Ahram newspaper. Museum displays parity of women in ancient EgyptEgypt's first-ever female judge was Tahany al-Gebaly, who in 2003 was appointed as vice-president of the Supreme Constitutional Court. Gabaly was removed from her post in 2012 under then President Mohamed Morsy. She died in January after contracting Covid-19. There were more than 45 million women in Egypt as of 2018, according to data from the state statistics agency CAPMAS, representing almost half the population. Egypt's population is more than 102 million.

        "content": "(CNN)The Biden administration is rolling out more stringent emissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles like large trucks and buses and announcing more than $1.3 billion in funding to deploy more clean transportation and school buses.  The US Environmental Protection Agency is also announcing stricter standards regulating nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from heavy-duty trucks, updating the standard for the first time since 2001. In addition, the EPA said it plans to tighten greenhouse gas emissions standards for medium and heavy-duty vehicles -- standards on which the agency is now accepting public comment.   Much of the Biden administration's focus on cutting vehicle emissions has so far been on light-duty vehicles like passenger cars. Transportation emissions account for the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US, and light duty vehicles account for 58% of total emissions.  Still, heavy-duty vehicles like big trucks and buses make up about 23% of total emissions; though there are fewer of them on the roads than smaller cars, they emit a lot of pollution and planet-warming greenhouse gases.  In addition to the new regulation, Vice President Kamala Harris held a Monday event to announce new spending on cleaner transit and school buses provided by the bipartisan infrastructure law. Harris and the Department of Transportation announced the more than $1.3 billion in 2022 funding to help states buy electric transit buses.Read More\"Imagine a future: The freight trucks that deliver bread and milk to our grocery store shelves and the buses that take children to school and parents -- all the heavy-duty vehicles that keep our supply lines strong and our economy to grow -- imagine that they produce zero emissions,\" Harris said at the event. \"We are all in the midst of a turning point.\"The administration is also rolling out $17 million for electric zero-emission and low-emission school buses. The new funding comes in addition to $7 million through the American Rescue Plan to replace older diesel school buses with electric buses in underserved communities. The newly proposed EPA rules on NOx starting with mileage year 2027 vehicles largely focuses on cutting air pollution and improving air quality. The agency's fact sheet states the new rules will make truck engine manufacturers build engines with better emissions controls, to help vehicles not emit so much NOx while trucks are idling or in stop-and-go traffic.  \"This proposed rule would ensure that the heavy-duty vehicles and engines that drive American commerce and connect people all across the country are as clean as possible, while charting to advance zero-emission vehicles in the heavy-duty fleet,\" EPA Administrator Michael Regan said Monday.The agency is proposing two options for its new rule; both would go into effect in 2027, but one option would implement even stronger standards in mileage year 2031. This option would bring down NOx emissions under 400,000 tons annually, compared to about 500,000 tons for the less stringent option. The current baseline is over 900,000 tons of NOx per year.But one state regulator said the interim NOx rule is missing the bigger picture -- a transition to zero-emissions trucks.  \"The real goal here is zero emissions vehicles, that's really California's more compelling priority on this,\" California Air Resources Board member Daniel Sperling told CNN. \"This is a transition issue really. NOx is a problem; it forms ozone, but we'll get more NOx reduction with zero-emissions vehicles.\" Zero-emissions trucks are on the horizon  While the EPA's new rule focuses heavily on cutting nitrous oxide emissions, the trucking industry and state pollution regulators are watching for the emergence of zero-emissions trucks.The California Air Resources Board -- which sets California vehicle emissions standards -- already passed its own rule requiring truck makers to sell more zero-emission trucks in the state, and other states are following.  EPA's rule does not go that far -- yet.  The agency announced Monday it is looking at updating federal regulations due to \"these market shifts to zero-emission technologies, which the agency did not foresee when it issued the 'Phase 2' GHG emission standards\" for medium and heavy-duty vehicles. But the EPA is still taking comment on new greenhouse gas rules for heavy-duty vehicles, not issuing a new rule just yet. The trucking industry has been wary of a fast shift to zero-emissions vehicles, due to the increased cost of the vehicles themselves and relative lack of charging stations for heavy-duty trucks that drive all over the country.  \"If they don't feel they meet the same needs, they're just going to keep their old trucks longer,\" said Jed Mandel, president of the Truck and Engine Manufacturers Association -- a trade association representing engine and truck manufacturers.  Mandel added that while zero-emissions \"technology is coming and we want it to come,\" truck manufacturers also \"don't want this rule to be so stringent as to take away the investment needed for the real prize which is zero-emissions vehicles.\" California setting its own standard is important because of the state's massive economy, which has a huge influence on the national market. The Biden administration is soon poised to reinstate California's waiver to set its own stricter vehicle emission standards -- which was rolled back by the Trump administration.The federal waiver will be a major step in the state being able to move the ball forward on zero-emissions trucks, which Sperling said will be going a step further than the federal government.  \"Clearly California has taken the lead, and California wants the feds to closely follow,\" Sperling said, adding that is important because the majority of trucks traveling through California are out-of-state trucks that don't have to comply with the stricter standards.  \"I would say California wants everyone to go forward fast\" on zero-emissions vehicles, Sperling said. \"If you look at political realities, the attitude is yes, we have to be the leader because the feds are not, and other states are not following fast.\"",

They say the four named companies are not the only businesses receiving IFC funds in the region.\"I think it's clear that the IFC needs to divest from all their investments in the Uyghur region,\" said report author Laura Murphy, a professor in Human Rights and Contemporary Slavery at Sheffield Hallam University, who added that it is \"incumbent on the IFC based on their own standards that they ensure that their clients are not involved in forced labor.\"I think it's clear that the IFC needs to divest from all their investments in the Uyghur regionLaura Murphy, Sheffield Hallam UniversityIn a statement, an IFC spokesperson told CNN the corporation has \"strong environment, social and governance (ESG) standards\" that are diligently applied during the life of the investment and are considered a model for development finance worldwide.\"We do not tolerate discrimination or forced labor under any circumstances,\" the spokesperson said. \"Whenever such serious allegations are brought to our attention, we work to verify and address them with our clients with urgency.\"Beijing responded to the report on Thursday, saying it was \"false\" and \"full of lies and groundless accusations.\"\"It is understood that the organization has no staff in Xinjiang. There was no field investigation, no real research, no evidence to back up the report,\" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said in a briefing. \"The Chinese government attaches great importance to the protection of human rights and workers' rights and interests. For some time now, certain countries have been hyping up social lies and extending their reach to multilateral development institutions,\" Wang added. CNN sought comment from the four Chinese companies named in the report but did not receive a response. The report's authors also said they attempted to contact them but did not receive a response. Police officers patrolling the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China in 2018.'Punished with internment'Xinjiang has become a geopolitical hotspot because of the breadth of human rights abuses alleged to have taken place in the region, including what some Western governments have called the \"genocide\" of Uyghurs and other minorities. The US State Department has estimated that since 2017 up to two million members of religious and ethnic minorities have been imprisoned in a shadowy network of internment camps. China has described the facilities as \"vocational training centers\" where people learn job skills, Chinese language and laws, and officials declared in 2019 that such centers  \u2014 also aimed at deradicalizing local Muslims \u2014 had been closed down. They also claimed that the original detainees had graduated but that people were still enrolling to gain new skills. Western governments and human rights organizations have alleged that minorities in the region have been subjected to forced labor through job creation schemes run by the Chinese government to achieve \"poverty alleviation.\"Workers who have participated in those job programs have told CNN that if they did not take the jobs they were offered, for a fraction of the usual rate of pay, they were warned they would be sent to camps.\"The Chinese government has embarked on a massive campaign which they deem to be poverty alleviation,\" said Murphy of Sheffield Hallam. \"These programs are often non-consensual, and people who refuse can be punished with internment.\"Such attempts to attack and smear China based on lies and disinformation are bound to failChinese government statementChina has consistently denied all allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang and told CNN in a statement prior to publication that claims of forced labor were lies created to smear its reputation.\"China has repeatedly emphasized that the so-called issues of 'forced labor' and 'repression' against ethnic minorities are huge lies concocted by anti-China forces in the US and the West. They are entirely baseless. Such attempts to attack and smear China based on lies and disinformation are bound to fail,\" the statement said.A watchtower at a high-security facility near what is believed to be a re-education camp on the outskirts of Hotan, Xinjiang.Concerns raised about IFC outcomes Based in Washington, D.C., the IFC describes itself as the \"largest global development institution focused on the private sector in developing countries.\" It is part of the World Bank Group and says it provided roughly $31.5 billion in loans and other financial assistance \u2014 including nearly $12 billion in \"fragile, conflict-affected, and poverty-stricken countries\" \u2014 last fiscal year to private companies and financial institutions in emerging and developing economies around the world.The IFC spokesperson told CNN its mission is to \"fight poverty by helping the private sector thrive.\" \"In doing so, we create jobs and raise living standards, especially for the poor and vulnerable,\" the spokesperson said.But its investments have been criticized for years by charities that accuse the IFC of sometimes causing more harm than good by failing to carry out due diligence. In 2015, Oxfam International published a report compiled with input from several NGOs that claimed the IFC sent billions of dollars in \"out of control\" investments to third parties that caused \"human rights abuses around the world.\"IFC said at the time that it was working with its clients to resolve issues raised by Oxfam and other civil society organizations and that it valued any insights into those concerns. The organization also said that it took additional efforts to train its staff and be more selective about its clients and was strengthening oversight and supervision. The World Bank Group had been acknowledging concerns even prior to that report. In 2013, the organization's Independent Evaluation Group highlighted declining \"outcome ratings\" for IFC-financed projects and advised the IFC to focus on \"supervision\" and \"enhancing the quality of projects\" through \"intensified efforts.\"CNN approached the World Bank Group for comment about the Helena Kennedy Centre's findings, and a spokesperson directed CNN to the IFC's response.The World Bank headquarters in Washington, D.C. Alleged connections to forced labor The four Chinese companies with ties to Xinjiang named in the Helena Kennedy Centre report work in sectors ranging from food to pharmaceuticals and energy. Using corporate documents, stock exchange filings, Chinese state media reports, IFC disclosures and satellite imagery, the report claims these companies have ties to parts of the region where allegations of forced labor are rampant. In some cases, the report says these companies have participated in state-endorsed \"labor transfer\" or \"poverty alleviation\" schemes, which international human rights organizations and foreign governments have for years claimed perpetuate forced labor in the region. CNN has independently verified that the four companies named in the Helena Kennedy Centre report have all received loans from the IFC in recent years. At least two of those loans, made to Camel Group and Jointown Pharmaceutical, have been used to finance projects in Xinjiang. Because the firms are all publicly traded on Chinese stock exchanges, corporate filings detail some of their dealings in the region. Chinese state media reports also explain some of their work, while the IFC's own records shed some light on the organization's involvement in providing financing to these firms. One company, Chenguang Biotech Group, makes food additives, natural dyes and pigments, and sources its raw materials primarily from India and Xinjiang. In Xinjiang, the company is involved in the production of marigolds.The IFC, which loaned Chenguang $40 million in 2019 so the company could increase production, conducted an assessment that found the company's risk of being implicated in forced labor with respect to marigold growers to be \"low\" and that overall \"the risks in Chenguang's primary supply chain are low to medium.\" But according to the Helena Kennedy Centre report, Chenguang sources some of its workforce from \"coercive\" state-sponsored labor and land transfer programs. The report claims that in some cases farmers have no say in whether to participate in major farming projects, or what they want to plant. Companies, too, are under pressure to support state programs.JUST WATCHED'How can we feel safe?': Uyghur on Chinese government policyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'How can we feel safe?': Uyghur on Chinese government policy 03:55Citing an official press release, the report said that, in one case, the paramilitary organization Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), which controls the region economically and politically, conducted \"ideological work\" on those who expressed reluctance about changing their farming methods, which the report described as a method of \"coercing\" minorities. Those people are encouraged by government agencies to \"relinquish their land, change their crops, alter their farming methods, work for cooperatives or large-scale farms that have expropriated their lands, or move to factory labor,\" the report said. Another company, the battery maker Camel Group, received nearly $36 million in funding from the IFC in July 2019 to expand its battery recycling operations in parts of China, including Xinjiang, according to IFC documents. Chinese corporate records also show the company has at least two subsidiaries in the region.An IFC risk assessment did acknowledge \"potentially significant adverse environmental or societal risks\" on account of smelting waste lead but added that Camel promised the organization it would promote the hiring of more local minority residents in Xinjiang.  IFC also assessed that \"no forced labor practices\" are used by Camel Group and that its battery suppliers are subject to quarterly audits by the company to ensure they are complaint with child and forced labor inspections.However, the Helena Kennedy Centre report cited government press releases that it says show Camel has benefited from state-sponsored labor transfer programs. In July 2017, according to one government release, 165 laborers were taken across Xinjiang for a 10-day long \"closed pre-job training,\" which the report authors say was an indication that their movements were restricted. During that time, according to a government press release, the participants received \"military and ideological training,\" and \"were required to sing patriotic songs\" and learn Mandarin Chinese \u2014 measures that human rights organizations worry can lead to the erasure of culture for Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs and Kyrgyz in Xinjiang. Those groups speak languages closer to Turkish than Mandarin Chinese. Before the laborers were dispatched to their assigned companies \u2014 one of which was Camel \u2014 they were made to attend a flag-raising ceremony, affirm their loyalty to the ruling Chinese Communist Party and pledge to \"make due contributions to national security, national unity, social stability and harmony,\" according to the government press release. A third company, the fertilizer and materials firm Century Sunshine Group, received $165 million from the IFC between 2014 and 2016, according to IFC documents.  That figure includes $125 million to upgrade a fertilizer manufacturing facility in Jiangsu province, north of Shanghai on China's eastern coast. As of December 2020, IFC had roughly a 17% stake in the company, according to an annual report from Century Sunshine.Century Sunshine also has ties to Xinjiang. The report cited local state-run media from December 2017 that said the company's Xinjiang subsidiary took in 10 rural laborers from a township in eastern Xinjiang through state-sponsored labor transfer programs. Two years later, that same subsidiary was one of nine firms that participated in a state-backed labor recruitment event that encouraged off-season farmers to work for industrial manufacturing facilities in the area \u2014 an event involving labor transfer the report's authors said was at \"high risk\"of violating standards for labor and working conditions.The final company implicated in the report, Jointown Pharmaceutical, received nearly $200 million in debt financing from the IFC in the last few years, according to IFC documents. IFC assessed their investments in Jointown Pharmaceutical as having \"limited\" environmental or social risks.The company \u2014 which distributes personal protection equipment, medical devices and pharmaceutical drugs \u2014 received nearly $150 million in July 2019 to build distribution centers and upgrade four warehouses in middle and western China, including Xinjiang. In October 2020, Jointown Pharmaceutical received another $50 million to buy pharmaceutical products and expand distribution because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Like Camel and Century Sunshine, the Helena Kennedy Centre report alleges that Jointown Pharmaceutical has participated in Xinjiang-related labor transfer programs. The report cited an article published in December 2020 by the Xinjiang Food and Drug Administration on its official WeChat account that said Jointown Pharmaceutical acknowledged receiving \"more than 200\" workers \"transferred\" from southern Xinjiang and other remote and underdeveloped prefectures through the labor programs. The report also said that Jointown Pharmaceutical has \"many\" facilities in Xinjiang that are located next to buildings identified as internment camps by the Australian Strategy Policy Institute, a Canberra-based think tank. One of Jointown Pharmaceutical's facilities in the regional capital of Urumqi, for example, is in one of the city's \"largest prison districts,\" according to the report.Efforts to monitor investments in XinjiangWhile travel to Xinjiang by foreign organizations has become almost impossible in recent years, the Helena Kennedy Centre report says the IFC paid a one-day visit to the region in 2019, during the height of the government crackdown there.Report co-author Kendyl Salcito, the Executive Director of human rights research non-profit NomoGaia, told CNN she spoke via phone to an IFC representative who went on the trip. The employee told Salcito that their group was temporarily detained by police three times within a roughly 24-hour period, adding that the atmosphere was very uncomfortable and they wanted to leave quickly.The IFC continued to fund projects in the region after that visit, as seen in IFC documents reviewed by the report authors and by CNN. In November 2020, Salcito said, the IFC told her that it did not have alternative arrangements for monitoring projects there. The IFC did not respond to CNN's questions about Salcito's account of the trip. However, the spokesperson told CNN that in the last two years the IFC has dedicated more resources to supervising companies it works with in Xinjiang.\"While accessing projects on the ground has been more difficult for all development actors in the last two years due to the Covid-19 pandemic and travel restrictions, IFC has dedicated more resources to supervising the companies we work with regarding adherence to our ESG standards. These standards are legally binding, include protections for workers, communities, and the environment, and expressly prohibit discrimination and the use of forced labor,\" the spokesperson said. Paramilitary police vehicles on a road in Artux in China's northwest Xinjiang region in June, 2019.The IFC has taken some steps to withdraw from the region. It ceased its relationships with three other Chinese firms that \"were engaged or sourcing from companies engaged in repression in the Uyghur Region,\" according to the report. The IFC did not respond to CNN's questions about why it chose to divest those companies and not others. In 2020, the IFC told Salcito in email exchanges viewed by CNN that the Chinese companies it works with assured the organization they did not use any forced labor. The IFC did not respond to CNN's questions about that correspondence. The Helena Kennedy Centre report authors say that form of self-reporting is wholly insufficient. \"The continued willingness to provide financing in the region, without any direct oversight, indicates that its investment strategy in the region continues to overlook the ongoing crimes against humanity and Performance Standards violations that render the IFC's investments complicit,\" the report said. A lack of due diligenceMultinational corporations have for years found it difficult to perform due diligence on their supply chains linked to Xinjiang because of limited access, surveillance and the threat of government interference. That makes the use of publicly available records and satellite imagery all the more important in determining whether a firm has ties to forced labor in the region. Satellite images, for example, have shown that detention facilities are often built up simultaneously alongside factories and business parks, which human rights activists say is a clear indication that factory workers are being drawn from the prison or camp population.Maxar satellite imagery of a re-education internment camp in\nHotan, Xinjiang, China.Some companies, investors and other organizations have pulled out of the region because of the difficulties in auditing activity there. Many international auditors will no longer certify products made in Xinjiang, and the Fair Labor Association \u2014  a Washington-based non-profit whose members include multinational corporations and Ivy League universities \u2014 has banned its members from sourcing from Xinjiang due to an inability to gather accurate information, or to verify if workers there are under duress.\"The underlying problem in the Uyghur region is the political repression is so great, we're of the view that no company can do adequate human rights due diligence,\" said Sophie Richardson, China Director of Human Rights Watch. \"Where  [a company] can't do adequate human rights due diligence, it should withdraw.\"Foreign governments have also been piling pressure on companies. In December, US President Joe Biden signed into law new rules that will effectively ban imports of products made in Xinjiang.

In December, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that the United States would not continue do \"business as usual\" and participate in the \"fanfare\" of the Games because of the \"ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang.\"But activists also point out that governments that work with the IFC should also review their funding plans. The United States, after all, has plowed more than $23 billion over the last 20 years into the World Bank Group, and as of June 2021 was the largest IFC shareholder with a stake of about 21%. That funding has increased during the pandemic: In March 2020, the World Bank Group announced that the US government authorized a $5.5 billion capital increase for the IFC as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act.In a statement to CNN, the US Treasury Department said that it \"works closely with other parts of the United States government to strongly condemn and respond to the atrocities taking place in Xinjiang.\"It said the government had pressed multilateral development banks (MDBs) \u2014 including the IFC \u2014 to strengthen their safeguards so projects \"do not inadvertently support companies that participate in or benefit from forced labor.\"The statement added: \"The US has been \u2014 and will continue to be -\u2014 a lead voice on this issue in all the MDBs and will continue working with other shareholder countries to make companies with alleged linkages to forced labor practices ineligible for MDB investments.\"",

The world has watched the Russian invasion of Ukraine unfold during a pandemic that still holds the globe within a firm grip after more than two years. The attacks and the resulting sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe have a far-reaching impact -- and even space isn't off-limits. The crisis is likely to delay the launch of Europe's first Mars rover slated for this September, and questions linger over cooperation between NASA and Russia regarding the International Space Station.A relentless cycle of events that spark despair can feel exhausting, but turning to sources of awe in difficult times can be heartening. When the pandemic began, many discovered a passion for the scintillating delights of stargazing.Fortunately, natural wonders never cease. Let's keep exploring the inspiring world of discovery -- and always keep hope alive.Read MoreLunar updateImpact craters can be seen across the surface of the moon.I'll see you on the far side of the moon. A rocket part was on a collision course with its surface on Friday morning, moving at about 5,500 miles per hour (8,851 kilometers per hour). We may not have confirmation for some time. But what could have been a lunar lemon has turned into a unique research opportunity. And don't worry -- you didn't miss a spectacular show since it was expected to hit on the shadowed lunar far side (but we have an idea of what it may have looked like). NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter -- which did not witness the event -- will keep an eye out for a crater that may have formed from the possible collision. The moon has plenty of craters -- this could just be the first one created by errant rocket leftovers. And tracking space junk, especially to avoid unwanted collisions, has become the passion project of none other than Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak.Dino-mite!You know that dramatic showdown between Stegosaurus and T. rex in \"Fantasia\"? It never happened. The two highly recognizable dinosaurs never coexisted, and the time separating them is greater than the time between T. rex's reign and humans. But both dinos share the spotlight this week. And, as it turns out, Tyrannosaurus rex may be misunderstood. The differences between fossils of the fearsome predator may suggest there was more than one species roaming the planet, according to a new study. This means the tyrant lizard king may have existed alongside Tyrannosaurus imperator and the more slender Tyrannosaurus regina. Meanwhile, a new fossil may belong to one of the oldest stegosaurs ever discovered. The specimen has a \"really weird mix of features\" including physical traits that can't be traced in other stegosaurs, revealing how these armored dinosaurs evolved.

        "content": "London (CNN Business)When you turn on the heating in your home, you may not think much about where your energy comes from, let alone where the money you pay for it goes. For millions of people living in Europe, there's a good chance that money is flowing to the Russian state \u2014 much of it into President Vladimir Putin's war chest.Russia has been building a network of natural gas pipelines throughout Europe since the 1960s. Washington has been warning its Western allies ever since that more Russian gas will only make Europeans more vulnerable to Moscow. There are fears now that the Kremlin may turn off the supply of natural gas to the European Union, in retaliation for its support for Ukraine \u2014 Europe, among other allies, has been sending weapons and aid to Ukraine to help it defend itself against Russia's invasion.It's only been just over a week, but so far, Russia has let the gas flow. But that presents another problem. Russia is earning hundreds of millions of dollars a day from its oil and gas exports, undermining the financial sanctions Western powers have introduced to choke off financing for Putin's war effort. The European Union, Russia's biggest gas customer, is now grappling with the reality that its energy spending has helped empower Putin to carry out a bloody war on its borders.Read MoreAccording to the European think thank Bruegel, with prices at record highs, the value of Russian natural gas exports to the European Union has soared to about \u20ac500 million ($545 million) every day. That's up from about \u20ac200 million ($220 million) in February. Before the invasion, Russia was also exporting oil worth hundreds of millions a day to Europe. EU leaders have been talking about reducing reliance on Russian gas for years. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki put it plainly last week. \"We are buying, as [the] European Union, lots of Russian gas, lots of Russian oil. And President Putin is taking the money from us, from the Europeans. And he is turning this into aggression, invasion,\" he told an EU summit, according to reports. For gas alone, the 27-country bloc relies on Russia for 40% of its needs. By country, Germany is Russia's biggest customer, relying on the nation for more than half of its gas, according to Bruegel.In turn, Russia needs Europe's money. Russian oil and gas revenues in 2021 were worth 9.1 trillion rubles, which in January this year converted to $119 billion, Reuters reports. That made up 36% of the country's budget. Moscow's international reserves now stand at $630 billion, its highest ever, making for a huge war fund. But its financial firepower has been severely constrained by Western sanctions that analysts estimate have frozen about half of those assets.The push to ban Russian oil is gaining steam. Here's what that means for US energy pricesThose sanctions are battering the Russian economy, but they haven't yet targeted fossil fuel exports directly, so concerned are Western governments about soaring energy prices and the cost of living. Ultimately, they want Russian gas, at least, to keep flowing.Oil is another story. While the price of benchmark Brent crude soared this week, trading at around $115 a barrel on Friday, Russia's flagship Urals crude was offered at a discount of $18 a barrel, a sign that some buyers are shunning it.Banks and traders fear getting caught up in financial sanctions, and shipping companies and insurers are worried about the risk to tankers in the Black Sea. Besides, Europe can buy oil from elsewhere. Replacing Russia natural gas is more difficult.Turning the heat down can save huge amounts of gasProponents of climate action have for years pushed for a plan to wean the world off natural gas, which is a potent planet-warming fossil fuel. It has taken an energy crisis and bloodshed in Ukraine to finally kick EU institutions into gear. EU energy chief Kadri Simson said Thursday that the bloc will release its plan next week for reducing its reliance on Russian gas, and for speeding up the adoption of more renewable energy.\"Beyond the short term, ultimately ... the only lasting solution is the Green Deal, boosting renewables and energy efficiency as fast as technically possible. So we are still far too dependent on fossil fuel imports,\" she said at a press conference with the International Energy Agency. Germany, which had aimed to transition to 100% renewables by 2040, has already brought its target forward by five years, since Russia invaded Ukraine last week.The Ukraine crisis has also injected new urgency into conversations about whether the world can go on using as much energy as it does. Europe should be able to replace some of Russia's gas supply, but cutting it out altogether simply isn't an option for this heating season, experts told CNN previously. Even down the line, replacing Russian gas in full will be difficult. IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol suggested that Europeans could turn down their thermostats as part of the solution.According to a 10-point plan aimed at reducing reliance on Russian gas, the IEA says that if all buildings in the European Union turned down the heat by just 1 degree Celsius, the bloc would save 10 billion cubic meters of gas. That's roughly the same amount of natural gas New York City consumes in three months, or what Hungary consumes over a year.Actually asking people to do this would be something of a last resort, said Ben McWilliams, a climate and energy analyst at Bruegel.These US cities tried to cut natural gas from new homes. Republicans and the gas lobby stepped in\"But who knows? It's an unprecedented situation. I could imagine a kind of political campaign, a real push by European leaders saying, look, if you can help us by turning down 1 degree on your thermostat, it's going to help. And you can see people uniting behind this, against Russian gas,\" he told CNN. \"But ultimately, you'll need much more than this in response.\"One approach would be to replace around half the gas from other sources, McWilliams said. The United States is already shipping Iiquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe, and EU officials are also looking to countries like Azerbaijan and Qatar. The other half will need to come from cutting demand, McWilliams said, especially as Europe prepares for next winter.Heavy industries, like steelmaking and chemical production, will need to reduce their operations. Homeowners investing in solar panels and heat pumps could help take some pressure off heating systems.Tara Connolly, a campaigner with the international NGO Global Witness who specializes in gas, says that Europe must launch an emergency program to insulate homes, replace gas boilers with heat pumps and accelerate the transition to renewable energy.\"It is abundantly clear that Europe's gas dependence has provided Putin with the resources to engage in his bloody venture in Ukraine, whilst hampering Europe's response,\" she said. \"This moment has shown that not only are fossil fuels wrecking the climate, they are contributing to a more volatile and dangerous world.\"CNN's Charles Riley and Julia Horowitz contributed to this report.",

Previously known as \"gypsy moth,\" the species Lymantria dispar is now \"spongy moth,\" according to the Entomological Society of America, which makes the Common Names of Insects and Related Organisms List, an essential database for anyone working with insects.  For the Romani people -- an ethnic group originating in northern India that was at one time misidentified as Egyptian -- the word \"gypsy\" has been offensive, dangerous and dehumanizing since it first appeared in the 1500s, Margareta Matache, director of the Roma Program at the FXB Center for Health and Human Rights at Harvard University, told CNN in July 2021. Sign up for CNN's Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. Matache was one of several Romani scholars consulted during the name removal process. \"This process to rename the G moth can serve as a truly effective practice on how to create better common names and ensure substantive and just participation of the affected communities in the process,\" Matache said via email.Read MoreNative to Europe, Asia and North Africa, the spongy moth is an invasive pest in North American forests, destroying the leaves of hundreds of tree and shrub species and costing hundreds of millions of dollars in damage and management efforts annually, according to the Entomological Society of America. This moth spends most of its 10-month life in the egg stage, which is when it travels on firewood, outdoor equipment and vehicles en masse. Pictured is the spongy moth in larval form.\"Public awareness is critical in slowing its spread,\" said the society's president, Jessica Ware, in a news release. \"'Spongy moth' gives entomologists and foresters a name for this species that reinforces an important feature of the moth's biology and moves away from the outdated term that was previously used.\" \"We are grateful to the diverse community of people and organizations who have been involved in this renaming process and have committed to adopting 'spongy moth' as well,\" Ware added. The moth's new name was chosen from more than 200 nominations evaluated by a group of more than 50 scientists convened by the society. The group sought insight from many experts and organizations and collected more than 1,000 responses about seven finalist names. \"Spongy moth\" refers to its sponge-like egg masses and comes from the common name \"spongieuse,\" used for the insect in France and French-speaking Canada, according to the news release. Spongy moth egg masses cluster on tree bark. In addition to the new name now being listed on the Common Names List, \"spongy moth\" will be used in the society's publications, presentations and social media. The society's Better Common Names Project has launched a toolkit for adopting the new name as a resource for other organizations and experts.\"'Spongy moth' is already beginning to appear in media stories and other online resources, which we're excited to see,\" Ware said. \"But we know this name change won't happen overnight.\"\"In books or print products, or regulations related to L. disphar, phasing in use of the new name may take some time,\" she added. \"ESA will continue to provide supporting resources for organizations adopting this change.\" Prejudice has \"produced profound harm in the lives of Romani Americans and the global Romani diaspora,\" Matache said in an email. \"Changing the name of this insect is very relevant in rectifying the mainstream, White narratives about Romani people. I hope that the decision to give up the G-word gets to be followed by others who also need to change the names of businesses, events, websites, fashion collections, cakes, food, drinks and college parades that include the G-word.\"CNN's Neelam Bohra and Radhika Marya contributed to this story.",

        "content": "(CNN)For the first time since it was filled more than 50 years ago, Lake Powell, the second-largest reservoir in the country, is projected to dip past a critical threshold, threatening water supplies and putting a key source of hydropower generation at heightened risk of being forced offline, as climate change-fueled drought continues to grip the Western US.The US Bureau of Reclamation told CNN it is currently anticipating water levels in Lake Powell to reach a significant elevation of 3,525 feet above sea level sometime between March 10 and 16.Drought contingency plans define the 3,525-foot mark as a significant \"target elevation\" for the reservoir, under which the situation becomes dire. As of Thursday, Lake Powell had fallen to just over 3,526 feet in elevation, which is just over 24% of capacity and less than two feet away from the critical level.\n\n\n\nInteractive: The Colorado River's shortage is a sign of a larger crisis\n\n\n\"We're kind of in some uncharted territory, socially and economically,\" Justin Mankin, assistant professor of geography at Dartmouth College and co-lead of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Drought Task Force, told CNN. \"It's totally within reason to expect that the next couple of weeks or so for [Lake Powell] to fall below the critical level.\"Lake Powell's plunging water level threatens Glen Canyon Dam's capacity to produce hydropower, much like Lake Mead and Hoover Dam. Glen Canyon Dam provides power for many states including Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and Nebraska. \n\nRead MoreThe 3,525-foot target is crucial because it allows a 35-foot buffer for emergency response to prevent Lake Powell from dropping below the minimum pool elevation of 3,490 feet above sea level, the lowest at which Glen Canyon Dam is able to generate hydropower.Lake Powell and nearby Lake Mead, the nation's largest reservoir, have drained at an alarming rate in the last year. In August, the federal government declared a water shortage on the Colorado River for the first time after Lake Mead's water level plunged to unprecedented lows, triggering mandatory water consumption cuts for states in the Southwest which began in January.The significance of the dwindling supply in the two reservoirs, fed by the Colorado River watershed, cannot be overstated. Water flowing down the Colorado River fills both Powell and Mead, which are part of a river system supplying more than 40 million people living across seven Western states and Mexico. Both reservoirs provide a critical supply of drinking water and irrigation for many across the region, including rural farms, ranches and native communities.The low water levels in the critical reservoirs, according to Mankin, only \"amplifies inequities\" across the Western states, where the \"poorest cultivators and those who have the least senior water rights are not going to get any water,\" he said.The 'central bank' of the Colorado RiverFor months, Western water managers have tried to prevent the worst-case scenario from happening. Last summer, they made emergency releases from other upstream reservoirs across the region including the Blue Mesa, Flaming Gorge and Navajo reservoirs. The water transfer  made levels in Colorado's Blue Mesa drop by 8 feet, forcing an early end to the region's boating season which was detrimental to the local economy. Antelope Point Marina on Feb. 3, 2022, in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area near Page. Lake Powell was at 26% of capacity, 168 feet below its full elevation of 3,700 feet above sea level at the time.\nOnce Lake Powell drops below 3,525 feet, the Bureau of Reclamation would have to release more water from the smaller reservoirs once the spring snow melt dwindles toward the end of the summer, as part of the 2019 Colorado River Drought-Contingency Plan to keep it afloat. \"It's kind of like the central bank of an economy, drawing money from local banks to kind of keep the economy afloat,\" Mankin said. \"Lake Powell is the central bank of the Colorado River Basin. Maybe that's workable for a little while, but just like a household, the longer it's in debt, the harder it gets. And it's really the same thing with these reservoirs.\"Monthly water releases are essential to keeping the reservoir's elevation from dropping below the target level through the winter months until spring runoff materializes. Water managers are expecting Lake Powell's water levels to rise back up above 3,525 feet as a result of spring runoff season; however, drought conditions might cause it to plunge back down again. \"The effects of Lake Powell dipping below its critical threshold in spring could reverberate through the states reliant on that water months down the road,\" Mankin said, pointing to impacts in Glen Canyon's capacity to deliver hydropower, \"given the propensity for the American West to suffer some pretty gnarly heat waves.\"There's a 1-in-3 chance Lake Powell won't be able to generate hydropower in 2023 due to drought conditions, new study saysWater managers were hopeful when the 2022 water year got off to a promising start, after the Colorado River Basin experienced a wetter-than-normal October, but the very next month saw the second-driest November on record, quickly diminishing the outlook. Lake Powell lost around 1.5 million acre-feet of inflow in November, according to the Bureau of Reclamation. Across many parts of the West, the latest US drought monitor update shows the promising early-season snowpack \"flatlining\" during January and February. In California, a recent snow survey from the state Department of Water Resources showed reservoirs across the state will likely not fill up again this year.It may also be the case for the Colorado River basin. While it recently experienced substantial snowpack, the critically low water levels in reservoirs, coupled with the uncertainty of future snowpack, might require unprecedented action from governments. If future projections show the monthly releases are not enough to protect Lake Powell, the Bureau of Reclamation will need to consider other avenues. At the moment, the agency and the Upper Basin states are continuing to work on a Drought Response Operations Plan, which they expect to complete this April.Exclusive: Experts say the term 'drought' may be insufficient to capture what is happening in the WestBut given the rate at which the planet is rapidly warming, Mankin worries about the potential aftermath recovery process: \"Then what? Do we go back to kind of normal operations?\" he said. \"I feel a bit nervous about the fact that the climate is changing, but our management of water is not.\"Climate change's impacts on water in the West may just be a preview of what's to come.Around half of the world's population already experiences severe water scarcity each year in part due to climate-related factors, a major UN report released Monday said. It also concluded as many as three billion people around the world will experience \"chronic water scarcity\" under uncontrolled global warming.\"The drought is pretty baked in,\" Mankin said. \"My expectation is fully that the American West is going to be in a drought through the rest of this year, at the very least. To recover from this thing, we're talking about multiple seasons of above-average precipitation.\"",

With today's resolution we are officially on track for a cure.\"The resolution, which UNEA calls \"the most significant environmental deal since the Paris accord,\" is written in broad strokes and an intergovernmental committee is now tasked with negotiating a binding treaty that will have ripple effects on businesses and economies around the world.Read MoreAny treaty that puts restrictions on plastic production, use or design would impact oil and chemicals companies that make raw plastic, as well as consumer goods giants that sell thousands of products in single-use packaging.This would also have a significant impact on the economies of major plastic-producing countries, including the United States, India, China and Japan.Although UN officials were united in celebrating the agreement to have a plastic treaty, there remain disagreements over what should be include in a final pact, Switzerland's ambassador for the environment Franz Perrez said.\"This is a division between those who are ambitious and want to find a solution and those who don't want to find a solution for whatever reasons,\" he told a news conference in Nairobi on Tuesday.There is overwhelming public support for a UN treaty on plastic pollution, according to an IPSOS poll released this month, and delegates were swift to celebrate what they had achieved in Nairobi.

        "content": "London (CNN Business)Global crude oil prices surged to more than $110 per barrel and the cost of natural gas skyrocketed to a new record in Europe on Wednesday as Russia's escalating military campaign in Ukraine stoked fear in markets about a supply shock.Brent crude futures, the global benchmark, jumped nearly 9% to $113.65 per barrel, the highest level since 2014. US oil futures also gained more than 8% to trade at $112.25 per barrel. In Europe, the price of wholesale natural gas spiked 60% to a record high of \u20ac194 ($215) per megawatt hour. That's more than double where it stood last Friday.\"The market panic is here,\" said Louise Dickson, senior oil market analyst at Rystad Energy. \"The initial upward price reaction after the conflict in Ukraine started six days ago is only intensifying.\"Russia's energy riches haven't been directly targeted by Western sanctions imposed following the invasion of Ukraine. But it's a huge card the United States and Europe might yet play if Russia presses on with its assault.\"It's still on the table, it's not off the table,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told CNN on Wednesday.Read MoreBut she added that President Joe Biden does not want to \"topple the global oil markets or the global marketplace, or impact the American people more with higher energy and gas prices.\"Moscow is already finding it harder to sell shipments of Russian crude oil to traders and refineries worried about being caught in the fallout from sanctions targeting the financial system. Tanker operators are wary of the risk to ships in the Black Sea, and major global oil companies are ditching operations in the country.\n\nRussia's flagship Urals oil grade was trading at an $18 per barrel discount to Brent crude on Wednesday as buyers shunned Russian exports, according to analysts at Commerzbank. The discount hasn't been that wide since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the analysts said.\"Oil price differentials are reflecting a clear unwillingness to take Russian crude, and there continues to be [a] risk of more sanctions that could indirectly or directly impact oil purchases or supplies,\" said S&P Global Commodity Insights' Shin Kim, head of oil supply and production analysis.The massive price hikes come despite efforts by the West to calm markets, and risk further fueling already elevated global inflation. On Tuesday, the United States and 30 other members of the International Energy Agency authorized the release of 60 million barrels of emergency oil reserves, which would cover roughly two weeks of Russian oil shipments.\"The bottom line is this is not enough to cool off the market. It's a bit of a band-aid solution,\" said Michael Tran, managing director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.Surplus gas is burned off at a crude oil processing plant in Germany. The huge prices increases will make fuel more expensive around the world, hiking the cost of travel and commuting. They will also add to inflation and could act as a drag on economic growth, complicating decisions by global central banks as they try to counteract rising prices.Investors are afraid that Russian energy exports will be limited or halted as a result of the conflict in Ukraine \u2014 a key pipeline route, additional Western sanctions that could target the heart of Russia's economy, or retaliation by Moscow.\"Russian oil is seeing buying interest evaporate,\" said Commerzbank analysts. \"The market appears to be increasingly pricing in an outage of Russian oil shipments,\" they added.Russian natural gas is continuing to flow to Europe, according to Alex Froley, a market analyst at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services. But there's \"a lot of uncertainty and concern about how things could change,\" he said.Froley noted that the United Kingdom has banned Russian owned and controlled ships from its ports, which could disrupt shipments of liquefied natural gas from Russia that account for between 3% and 4% of the country's gas supply.\"Traders may be concerned whether continental Europe introduces a similar ban on Russian ships,\" he said.OPEC on the sidelinesThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied producers including Russia agreed on Wednesday to stick with their plan of gradually adding oil to the market, defying pressure from developed economies to do more to ease prices.The Saudi-led group, called OPEC+, said in a statement that it would increase output by 400,000 barrels per day in April \u2014 a small fraction of Russia's 10 million barrels per day crude oil production.\"Current oil market fundamentals and the consensus on its outlook pointed to a well-balanced market, and that current volatility is not caused by changes in market fundamentals but by current geopolitical developments,\" said OPEC+.Nuclear negotiations between Iran and the United States could put more Iranian barrels on the market, but that wouldn't ease the situation in the near term.Exit RussiaMany of the world's biggest oil companies are quitting Russia or halting new investments in projects to explore and develop fields.ExxonMobil said Tuesday that it was quitting its last project in the country, Sakhalin-1 \u2014 which was billed as \"one of the largest single international direct investments in Russia.\" An Exxon subsidiary was the project's operator, and the company's decision to walk away will end its presence of more than 25 years in Russia.BP, Shell and Norway's Equinor have all said this week they intend to exit their Russian businesses at a likely hit of billions of dollars to their balance sheets.

        "content": "(CNN)Winter is California's wet season, but a discouraging snow survey performed on Tuesday, along with an ominous (lack of) precipitation record set in Sacramento, shows that California reservoirs will likely not fill up again this year.\"With below-average precipitation and snow up until this point, our team's latest statewide snow melt forecast are only about 66% of average,\" said Sean de Guzman, manager of the Snow Surveys & Water Supply Forecasting Program with the California Department of Water Resources (DWR).\"That's not enough to fill up our reservoirs and without any significant storms on the horizon, it's safe to say that we will end this year dry and continue on into the third year of this drought.\" Snowfall in the Sierra Nevadas is imperative to replenishing the state's water supply. The DWR surveys the mountains for snow periodically during the winter months in order to better predict water levels later in the year. Tuesday, the third survey of the winter was conducted on the Phillips Station snow course in the Sierra Nevadas. Snow melts and runs off the Sierra Nevadas, working to fill up California's reservoirs. \"The winter season is California's wet season, when we count on storms from the tropical Pacific to bring precipitation to pack mountains with snow, and fill rivers, streams, reservoirs and soils with badly needed water,\" said Justin Mankin, an Assistant Professor of Geography at Dartmouth College.Read More After a great start to the winter season, de Guzman -- standing  in a field of snow with blue skies -- said, \"The majority of the snow pack that we are standing on right here today is basically the same snow that fell during December. There hasn't been much that has fallen ever since.\"And they are not expecting to see much more.\"Barring any unforeseen miracle March, which we don't actually see coming, we will end this year below average,\" de Guzman added. The third snow survey of the 2022 season is conducted at Phillips Station in the Sierra Nevadas.Most of California's major reservoirs are below average. Statewide reservoir storage stands at about 73% of average. Lake Oroville is only 47% full and Lake Shasta, the largest reservoir in the state, is 37% full.\"This past January and February were actually the driest, consecutive January and February on record dating back over 100 years in the Sierra Nevada,\" de Guzman said. It isn't just the lack of snowfall in the mountains that is setting records this winter. The lack of precipitation in one of California's major cities is expected to set a dismal rain record Tuesday.A record winter dry spell With no precipitation Tuesday, Sacramento will break the record for the longest dry stretch during the wet season -- going a whopping 53 days without rain. Monday, Sacramento tied the record for most consecutive days without rain in the wet season and is looking to blow past the 52-day record, according to the National Weather Service Sacramento.After a wet start to the water year we have shifted into an extended dry stretch of weather for the start of the year. At the end of today Sac will be tied for longest dry stretch of weather in the wet season and will break the old record of 52 days at the end of tomorrow. #CAwx pic.twitter.com/W34iBEKm4m\u2014 NWS Sacramento (@NWSSacramento) February 28, 2022\n\nThis dry spell came as a shock after a wet start to the water year, which starts October 1. Sacramento saw an impressive 14.37 inches of precipitation from October to December, which is more than double the average of around six inches for this period. This was followed by only 0.05 of an inch of precipitation in January and only trace amounts in February.Dry conditions are not unusual for many areas in California; however the timing of these dry conditions is. \"We aren't getting the amount of rain that we would normally get this time of year. January and February are two of our wettest months of the year, so when we are so dry it's not great for our numbers,\" Hannah Chandler-Cooley, NWS Sacramento meteorologist, told CNN. \n\nThere is, however, rain on the horizon for Northern California.Later this week, Sacramento is forecast to receive the most rain they've seen all year. Around a quarter to a half of an inch of rain is forecast, ending the almost two-month long dry spell. But this won't be nearly enough to significantly aid the water reserves. \"It is not a lot of rain for this time of year, especially considering how dry we've been the last couple of months,\" said Chandler-Cooley. \"At this point, anything helps. But in terms of the overall water storage, this won't have much of an impact.\"Lack of rain and snow has left California high and dryThis dry period is just one event within a multiyear drought that contributes to the even longer multidecade megadrought in the area. \"You can think of the current drought as an expression of the longer term megadrought that is unfolding across the American Southwest,\" Mankin says. Stepping back to look at the big picture is important in cases such as these.\"Just like we can have floods in the midst of a drought \u2014 a single storm missed does not make a drought like this; a single storm caught does not break a drought like this -- we can have multiple wet and dry periods in the context of a much longer dry period,\" Mankin added. \n\nClimate change has played a large role in more than two decades of drought.\"Recent work has suggested that the global warming that has occurred to date has made the drought over the last year about 20% worse than it otherwise would have been,\" Mankin said. The most dire consequence of below-average precipitation, especially in the context of a multiyear drought, is that there is less water for everything. Ecosystems, households industries, and agriculture may all suffer from lack of water, Mankin emphasized. The lack of precipitation in this region has and will continue to lead to devastating impacts on the environment and people who live there, such as the water restrictions placed on the Colorado River for first time.",

        "content": "(CNN)A large majority of Americans say the US should prioritize developing renewable energy, but remain wary of transitioning off fossil fuels entirely, according to new polling from Pew Research Center.The survey of 10,237 US adults was conducted weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine, which has increased energy costs around the world and raised concerns over energy security and reliance on fossil fuels. The results show 69% of American adults favor developing alternative energy, including wind and solar, over increasing production of fossil fuels like oil, coal and natural gas. It also found 69% of Americans want the US to take steps to become carbon neutral by 2050 -- as President Joe Biden is seeking to do.'Delay means death': We're running out of ways to adapt to the climate crisis, new report shows. Here are the key takeaways That being said, most Americans don't support phasing out fossil fuels completely, and the polling shows a partisan split on the issue. Just 31% of Americans want the US to completely phase out fossil fuel use, while 67% say the country should use a mix of renewable energy and fossil fuels.Read MorePew researchers found that while there's some concern that a renewable energy transition would lead to higher costs for everyday goods, 59% of respondents said they thought the prices they paid to heat and cool their homes would either improve or stay the same, compared to 39% who thought it would get worse. The poll didn't directly ask whether respondents would be willing to pay more for renewable energy.\"There's particular concern around prices,\" Alec Tyson, a lead author on the poll, told CNN. \"Slightly more [respondents] think the impact of this shift would make prices of everyday goods worse, not better.\"People participated in the poll via a self-administered web survey. If participants didn't have access to internet, a tablet with wireless access was provided. The margin of error on the poll was plus or minus 1.5 percentage points.The poll comes a day after the release of a major UN-backed climate report that found that the impacts of burning fossil fuels for energy were larger than previously thought, and humans and ecosystems are running out of ways to adapt to the climate crisis. The report's authors said the impacts are happening much faster and are more disruptive and widespread than scientists expected 20 years ago.Supreme Court hears case that could limit EPA's authority to regulate planet-warming emissions from power plantsThe poll found 72% of respondents said a clean energy transition would not happen quickly enough to prevent \"severe problems from climate change.\" Pew found majorities from both parties -- 85% of Democrats and Democratic leaners as well as 58% of Republicans and Republican leaners -- believed the energy transition wouldn't happen fast enough.In this State of the Union address on Tuesday, Biden \"will call on Congress to deliver on a legislative agenda for clean energy and climate action that has overwhelming support from the American people -- Republicans, Democrats and independents,\" a senior administration official said.More specifically, he is expected to ask for for renewed investment in and tax credits for domestic energy manufacturing and deployments, steps the administration says could save Americans an average of $500 a year in energy costs. He will also address the crisis in Ukraine, which has driven up the price of oil and gasoline.Pew researchers say that partisan affiliation \"remains the dominant divide\" for US adults in their views of climate and energy issues. Very large majorities of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents want the US to prioritize renewable development, while Republicans and Republican-leaning independents tend to favor expanding fossil fuel production. However, the GOP is not monolithic when it comes to energy issues.Pew researchers found disagreement in the party when it came to the question of the US becoming carbon neutral: 66% of self-described moderate and liberal Republicans favor taking steps toward carbon neutrality, while 64% of conservative Republicans opposed it. Pew found a similar divide when asking Republicans whether the US should prioritize renewables over fossil fuel development: 64% of moderate and liberal Republicans said the country should be developing alternative sources like wind and solar, while 67% of conservative Republicans favored expanding fossil fuel production.Wind and solar development are particularly popular; 72% of US adults said the federal government should encourage wind and solar production, compared to 51% who said the government should encourage the use of electric vehicles, 35% who said it should encourage nuclear power, 33% who said it should encourage oil and gas drilling. Less than 20% said the federal government should encourage coal mining.",

        "content": "New York (CNN Business)Coors Light is ditching plastic rings on its six-packs and replacing them with an environmentally friendlier option.Beginning later this year, Coors Light will instead be packaged in cardboard wrap carriers that are recyclable and sustainably sourced.Molson Coors (TAP) announced the change Tuesday, saying Coors Light is the largest beer brand in North America to make the switch. By 2025, all of the company's roughly 30 brands it distributes in North America \u2014 which include Blue Moon and Miller Lite \u2014 will use the cardboard packaging. Plastic rings have been used for decades to link together multi-packs of canned drinks, but they pose a risk to wildlife and have been linked to increased ocean pollution. Experts expect there will be more plastic than fish in global oceans by 2050, according to the World Economic Forum.Coors Light's new cardboard beer packaging.Such sobering statistics have fueled growing calls to eliminate single-use plastics across the business world, including from consumers. Molson Coors CEO Gavin Hattersley told CNN Business the change is \"pretty important\" to its customers, which have increasingly been seeking out more sustainable products. Read More\"Our consumers like the thought of products they consume being environmentally friendly,\" Hattersley said. \"The amount of plastic recycled is very, very low.\" Molson Coors says the switch to cardboard wrap carriers will eliminate 1.7 million pounds of plastic annually, Hattersley noted, adding that \"that's a significant amount of plastic that will be out of the system forever.\" The trends Coors is seeing in its customers are backed up by wider statistics: A recent survey from GlobalData found 57% of US consumers say that plastic-free packaging is very important in their purchasing decisions. The research firm said that plastic rings used in beer packaging have received \"heavy backlash following viral images of ocean wildlife getting caught up in them.\"Molson is beginning the plastic-ring phase-out with Coors Light because it's the largest brand in its portfolio. The company is investing $85 million in new machinery at its factories to make the switch.Cardboard packaging is already in use for Molson Coors beer brands distributed in the United Kingdom, and Hattersley said the company has made \"significant progress\" in the changeover in Canada. So far, the product has received \"very positive\" feedback in countries where cardboard is currently in use, he added. Molson joins other brands making changes in the US and worldwide. other Guinness, owned by Diageo (DEO), announced in 2019 it would switch to cardboard packaging. A year later, Budweiser Brewing Group in the United Kingdom announced similar changes, but still uses plastic rings for its US products. In Europe,  Carlsberg went a different route and created a \"Snap Pack\" that bonds cans together with glue.",

        "content": "Taipei, Taiwan (CNN)As a young man, Fred Chin spent years imprisoned on a craggy island off Taiwan. Before he was sentenced, guards punched him, forced him to drink his own blood, and hung him upside down while they poured salty water into his mouth, he said.Malaysian-born Chin had come to Taiwan to study at university in 1967, but attracted the attention of the island's secret police in 1971. He doesn't know why.They accused him of bombing a US government office in Taiwan the year before and working as a communist spy to overthrow the government in Taipei. There was no evidence, according to Chin, so secret police tortured him until he confessed to the crimes and imprisoned him for 12 years. \"They treated us like animals and didn't respect our dignity,\" said Chin, now 72. \"They wanted me to admit that the explosion was done by me.\" Former political prison Fred Chin in a former prison at Jing-Mei White Terror Memorial Park, where he was tortured by secret police in the 1970s.Read MoreChin was one of up to 200,000 people imprisoned during what became known as Taiwan's \"white terror,\" a four-decade crackdown on political dissent imposed by an authoritarian regime between 1947 and 1987, according to Taiwan government estimates. Both political activists and apolitical people like Chin were caught up in the crackdown. Until martial law lifted in 1987, the \"white terror\" events were considered a taboo subject. China's leaders may be watching Ukraine with an eye on TaiwanSince 1995, the \"white terror\" has been commemorated each year on February 28, the date the government violently suppressed a 1947 uprising in the capital Taipei, considered to be the start of the crackdown. The date is also shorthand for its popular name -- the 228 incident.The Taiwan government estimates that between 18,000 and 28,000 died during the uprising, while another 10,000 died in the subsequent four decades.As Taiwan marks 75 years since the event, interest in the island's painful journey to democracy is growing -- as are fears that it could be taken away.Experts have warned that Beijing could be taking notes from Russia's invasion of Ukraine for a similar move towards Taiwan. Tensions between mainland China and Taiwan have risen significantly in the last few years -- Beijing claims self-governed Taiwan as part of its territory and has refused to rule out the use of military force.  Activists and onlookers say the \"white terror\" period only highlights how difficult it has been to win democracy on the island -- and how much Taiwan potentially stands to lose. A long fight for freedomTaiwan, an island off the southeastern coast of mainland China and home to 24 million people, has had a long history of being governed by overseas powers.  For five decades, Taiwan was under the control of Japanese colonial rulers. But in 1945, after Japan's defeat in WWII, the island was handed to China's then-ruling Nationalist Party -- or Kuomintang.Less than two years later, rising tensions between local Taiwanese and their rulers from mainland China erupted into the 228 incident, said Wu Jieh-min, a political sociology professor at Taiwan's Academia Sinica. On February 27, 1947, Taipei police hit a contraband cigarette seller in the head while confiscating her wares. When bystanders came to her defense, police fired and killed one of them. The bystander's death sparked protests which evolved into sometimes violent riots, with demonstrators expanding their complaints to include growing inflation, corruption and conflicts between locals and mainland Chinese officials.Facing defeat in a civil war in mainland China, Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek retreated to Taiwan in 1949 and imposed martial law which lasted for 38 years -- one of the world's longest periods of martial law.President Chiang Kai-shek in Taipei in 1956.Hundreds of unwanted statues of former president Chiang Kai-shek were moved to a park in Taoyuan city, as Taiwan reflects on his oppressive role during the \"white terror\" period.Nevertheless, activists continued to fight for democracy.In December 1979, pro-democracy activist Annette Lu stood in front of a crowd of about 80,000 people at a human rights parade in Kaohsiung city. She hadn't planned to speak, but as she criticized the Kuomintang government for denying freedom to the Taiwanese people, she remembers the crowd falling silent. Some had tears in their eyes, she said. Suddenly, she saw military troops and police fire tear gas into the crowd. She was arrested along with other activist leaders and sentenced to 12 years in prison for sedition, during which time she says she wrote a novel on toilet paper. Ultimately she was released after five and a half years. Annette Lu in 2007, in Taipei, Taiwan. In 1987, martial law was lifted, and it was only in 1996 that Taiwan held its first direct Presidential election. In Taiwan's second-ever presidential election, Lu -- who had once been locked up for her political beliefs -- become the island's first female vice president. \"Once I joined the opposition movement, I knew sooner or later I would be jailed,\" she added. \"I told the crowd we had to fight together...The message landed me in prison, but so many people (were) inspired by me.\" Taiwanese identity Although the events of \"white terror\" took place decades ago, this period of history is gaining prominence in Taiwan.\"Among the younger generation, there has been heightened awareness about white terror and our history of democratization in recent years,\" sociology professor Wu said. \"New creations of literature and artwork on this topic are evidence that more people are paying attention.\"Earlier this month, Taiwanese indie rock band Sorry Youth invited a victim to appear in a music video filmed at a former detention center.  In 2019, Taiwanese horror film \"Detention,\" set during the \"white terror\" period, was a hit at the box office, and won numerous awards at Taipei's Golden Horse Award -- often dubbed the \"Chinese-language Oscars.\"And in 2018, President Tsai Ing-wen -- only the second-ever Taiwanese president not affiliated with the Kuomintang -- set up a transitional justice committee to review injustices committed during its authoritarian era. The committee officially exonerated former prisoners like Chin and Lu and offered compensation.

For many, human rights and democracy are very important,\" he said. Discussions about the \"white terror\" period -- and the importance of democracy -- have only grown in recent years as Beijing has piled military, economic and diplomatic pressure on Taiwan to achieve its longterm goal of \"reunification\" with the island. China's ruling Communist Party views Taiwan as an inseparable part of its territory, despite having never controlled it.  Some politicians and analysts have raised concerns that Beijing may be watching Russia's invasion of Ukraine with an eye on Taiwan. Last week, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said \"echoes\" of what happens in Ukraine \"will be heard in Taiwan,\" while US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also said \"others are watching\" the Western response to Russia, \"even if it's half a world away from Europe.\" China isn't about to invade Taiwan. But the two sides are on a dangerous pathFor its part, China says Taiwan is not Ukraine, claiming the island has belonged to China \"since ancient times.\"\"China's sovereignty and territory have never been divided and cannot be divided. This is the status quo of the Taiwan question,\" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said last week when asked about comparisons made between Taiwan and Ukraine.But while experts also pointed out differences between the geopolitical situations in Ukraine and Taiwan, the island's leaders put its military on \"a high level of vigilance.\"Last year China sent hundreds of warplanes into the skies above waters southwest of the island, prompting the island to issue radio warnings and deploy air defense missile systems to monitor the activities. Taiwan's Defense Minister, retired general Chiu Kuo-cheng, made a dire prediction -- by 2025, China could be able to mount a \"full-scale\" invasion of Taiwan.Beijing has previously criticized Taiwan's government for using the 228 incident as a tool to promote the island's separation from mainland China.\"If China invades or takes Taiwan in the foreseeable future, I'm very worried that the 228 tragedy would happen again,\" Wu said.\"The tragedy of the past is why many people are scared about establishing political ties with China again,\" he said. \"For Taiwanese people, many want to avoid this tragedy from happening again. And this is the reason why many people do not want to see Taiwan falling into the hands of a foreign regime again.\" The past as a warningVictims of the \"white terror\" continue to process what happened to them -- but they also hope their experiences serve as a lesson to younger generations. Chin, who became a Taiwanese citizen after his time in prison, now spends time reminding the younger generation of Taiwan's painful history by offering guided tours at a memorial park.\"We didn't want these kinds of things to happen again, to anyone else,\" he said. A memorial wall inside a former political prison on Green Island, Taiwan, bears the names of thousands of prisoners sentenced during the \"white terror\" period.Another white terror victim, Chen Wu-jen, was imprisoned for two years from 1969 after he scribbled words opposing the ruling Kuomintang on the back of an aptitude test during his military conscription. He was 20.Chen, now 73, went on to become an artist. Last year he became the first \"white terror\" victim to hold an exhibition at Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in Taipei, a building commemorating the leader who once oppressed him. The exhibition included his oil paintings and woodcarvings showing what it was like to be persecuted, and an area that invited visitors to reflect how Taiwan should correct its past mistakes and achieve transitional justice. Taiwan's former vice president Annette Lu spent more than five years in prison.He said it is important for the younger generation to understand the sacrifices many people made for democracy. \"The freedom we enjoy today did not fall from the sky, and only came about because many people worked hard for it,\" he added. Lu said this message is especially important to present-day Taiwan.\"We have to insist our principles -- democracy, freedom and the dignity -- are what our people desire for,\" said Lu, now 77. \"Our future has always been decided by outsiders,\" she said. \"We really want to be ourselves.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)The Supreme Court on Monday heard what could be one of the most consequential cases for climate change and clean air in decades, with Republican attorneys general and coal companies asking the court to strip the Environmental Protection Agency of its authority to regulate planet-warming gas emissions from power plants. During oral arguments for West Virginia v. EPA, which lasted about two hours, not all of the court's conservative majority appeared to be aligned with the petitioners, though some entertained the idea that the authority should be turned back to Congress. The Supreme Court hears a major case on EPA's authority over planet-warming gases. Here's what's at stake.The hearing came on the same day that a major UN-backed climate change report showed the impacts of burning fossil fuels were larger than previously thought, and that society is running out of ways to adapt to the crisis. Justices on the conservative wing of the court focused their questions on legal theories being argued by state attorneys general, including the scope of the Clean Air Act, which gives the EPA authority to regulate air pollution, and the role of the Major Questions Doctrine, which states that questions of significant political or economic importance must be decided by Congress.  West Virginia Solicitor General Lindsay See argued that the rise of renewable energy like wind and solar powering electricity is \"a major question, because it allows EPA to determine what the power sector as a whole should look like and who can be in it.\" Read MoreOn the other side, US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued the petitioners' case should be dismissed because there is no federal regulation for power plants on the books right now -- with both the Obama-era Clean Power Plan and the Trump-era Affordable Clean Energy rule dead. President Joe Biden's EPA has not yet issued a new rule.  'Delay means death': We're running out of ways to adapt to the climate crisis, new report shows. Here are the key takeawaysPrelogar was joined by Beth Brinkmann, an attorney representing power companies who want the EPA to keep its regulating authority. Both argued the court should not speculate on potential regulations, nor restrict the EPA from issuing them in the future.  The three liberal justices on the court seemed to agree with this idea in their line of questioning, which emphasized how big a shift it would be to strip the EPA's authority, both for the government and the power industry.  \"This is really a step further than anything we have said before,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor said. \"All of our other cases, whether its regulation of tobacco, or regulation of evictions under major questions doctrine, have not addressed the 'how.' Now ... you want us to look at the 'how.'\" Conservatives question scope of Clean Air ActDue to their current 6-3 majority on the US Supreme Court, there's no doubt the court's conservatives will be the important votes in this case. But some of their questions cast doubt that they would necessarily agree with the petitioners.  Justice Amy Coney Barrett pointed out that unlike in past cases where there's been a legitimate question of whether an agency is operating outside of its boundaries, the EPA is indeed charged with regulating greenhouse gas emissions -- something that has been reaffirmed by the Supreme Court twice. Cities tried to cut natural gas from new homes. The GOP and gas lobby preemptively quashed their effort\"Here, thinking about EPA regulating greenhouse gases, there's a match between the regulation and the agency's wheelhouse, right?\" Barrett asked coal company attorney Yaakov Roth. \"You're saying when you look at the scheme, this is a really big deal. That's a little bit different than a mismatch between the subject of the regulation and what the agency does.\" Similarly, Justice Clarence Thomas seemed skeptical about the arguments that power companies should only have to retrofit their plants to lower emissions \"inside the fence\" -- including coal scrubbers or carbon capture -- rather than pushing them to add cleaner sources of energy. \"I don't know how you can draw such clean distinctions,\" between inside and outside the fence, Thomas told Roth. \"It would seem as though EPA could regulate the source in a way that actually requires change in the mix of energy generation. That for example, the cost of running a facility is so high that you begin to change your generation sources say from coal to natural gas, or natural gas to solar.\" Biden administration freezes new oil and gas drilling leases after court rules against key climate toolOther conservatives, including Justice Samuel Alito, seemed more inclined to lean into the petitioners' argument -- asking the power utility attorney how far an agency would have to go in wielding its power before she considered it a major question.  Alito questioned whether considering the impacts of climate change could mean the EPA has very few limits on regulations, asking Prelogar if the agency could extend its power by regulating emissions from single-family homes -- something she said it is unable to do. \"What weight do you assign to the effects of climate change, which some people believe is matter of civilizational survival, and the costs and the effect on jobs?\" Alito said. \"I really don't see what the concrete limitations are in any of what you said if you take the arguments about climate change seriously, and this is a matter of survival.\" Justice Neil Gorsuch asked few questions during the hearing, but noted that the EPA's case was a \"strong argument\" that the states are not harmed given there's no rule in place. Liberal justices seemed skeptical  The three liberal justices, Elena Kagan, Stephen Breyer, and Sotomayor appeared skeptical of petitioners' arguments. Breyer questioned See on how delegating EPA's authority to Congress would work on a practical level.\"I had thought we have a whole US Code filled with delegations to different agencies, and many of those words are fairly technical,\" Breyer said. \"Is it a minor matter having to do with administration that they're more familiar with? Is it something that's going to change the whole United States of America -- that cuts the other way?\" Kagan asked why generation shifting -- or moving to generate electricity from renewable sources -- shouldn't be allowed by the EPA if it is a cheaper alternative for power companies and gives them flexibility. \"The way the grid works -- it prefers cheaper methods,\" Kagan said. \"And so EPA could come out with a rule that is plant by plant but makes coal plants hugely more expensive. This is essentially what the market is already doing, but EPA could do it faster.\" Kagan pointed to Thomas's earlier argument, saying that inside and outside the fence retrofits to coal plants would have the same end result and therefore didn't have much of a difference. \"This system, it's actually going to cost less for everybody than if we did something like what you're talking about,\" Kagan said. \"So why shouldn't EPA have that ability? Why shouldn't the states have that ability?\"",

The report's authors say these impacts are happening much faster and are more disruptive and widespread than scientists expected 20 years ago.Supreme Court hears case that could limit EPA's authority to regulate planet-warming emissions from power plantsThe authors point to enormous inequities in the climate crisis, finding that those who contribute the least to the problem are the worst affected, and warn of irreversible impacts if the world exceeds 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming.UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres called the report \"an atlas of human suffering and a damning indictment of failed climate leadership,\" and he warned that \"delay means death.\"\"The facts are undeniable. This abdication of leadership is criminal,\" Guterres said in a statement. \"The world's biggest polluters are guilty of arson of our only home.\"Read MoreHe also said that \"current events\" showed the world was too reliant of fossil fuels, calling them \"a dead end,\" in an apparent reference to the Ukraine conflict and energy crisis.

At warming of 2 degrees, for example, as many as 18% of all land species will be at high risk of extinction, according to the report. At 4 degrees, 50% of species are threatened.\"There are many challenges already with 1.5 degrees for several systems that we know about,\" said Hans-Otto P\u00f6rtner, a co-chair on the report and a scientist at the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research. \"Clearly for coral reefs, we must say that in many locations, they are already beyond tipping points. They are on the downslide.\"A man works in the Swiss Alps at the Rhone Glacier in October 2021, which is partially covered with insulating foam to prevent it from melting due to global warming.Highly vulnerable ecosystems in the Arctic, mountains and on the coasts are at the greatest risk to these changes, the authors say. Ice sheet and glacier melt will cause accelerated sea level rise, irreversible for centuries. Forests, peatlands and permafrost \u2014 places where greenhouse gas is naturally stored \u2014 risk being pushed into a situation where they are emitting those gases into the atmosphere, causing even more warming.We're running out of ways to adapt\"Adaptation\" is finding ways to live with the change \u2014 like putting up walls to ward off sea level rise or implementing new building codes to ensure homes can withstand more extreme weather. Scientists note some of our adaptations have blunted the impact of the climate crisis so far, but they are not adequate in the long-term. Our options to adapt will become even more limited at 1.5 degrees.A flood defense wall being constructed on the east side of Manhattan in New York City on December 11, 2021.And although the natural world has adapted to changing climates over millions of years, the pace of human-caused global warming is pushing many of the planet's most critical systems \u2014 like rainforests, coral reefs and the Arctic \u2014 to the brink. More extreme weather doesn't just affect humans, it is causing mass die-offs in plants and animals.Population growth and development, which has not been carried out with long-term adaptation in mind, are also luring people into harm's way. As many as 3.6 billion people live in places already highly vulnerable to climate hazards, some of which will increase beyond the ability to adapt once the planet hits the 1.5-degree mark.A lot of the world's resources, particularly international finance, goes toward reducing greenhouse emissions, which is known as mitigation. At the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland, last year, developing nations complained that the rich world was failing to help adequately fund adaptation in their countries.\"We have seen that the vast majority of climate finance goes towards mitigation rather than adaptation,\" said Adelle Thomas, an author on the report and a climate scientist at the University of the Bahamas. \"So although adaptation is taking place, there is not enough funding, and it is not a high priority, which are then leading to these limits.\"Up to 3 billion people will experience 'chronic water scarcity'Residents fill water containers during a shortage in Nairobi, Kenya, in January.Around half of the world's population experiences severe water scarcity each year in part due to climate-related factors, the report showed. Water will become even more scarce at higher global temperatures.At 2 degrees of warming \u2014 which scientists predict the planet will reach by midcentury \u2014 as many as three billion people around the world will experience \"chronic water scarcity,\" according to the report. It increases to four billion people at 4 degrees.Water shortages will put enormous pressure on food production and increase the world's already dire food-security challenges. A water crisis is already brewing in the Western United States. Multiyear drought has drained reservoirs and triggered unprecedented water cuts for the region. Lake Mead, the country's largest reservoir, plunged to record lows in recent months, threatening water supply for tens of millions of people. Dead almond trees lie in an open field after they were removed by a farmer because of a lack of water to irrigate them, in Huron, California, in July 2021. The authors say drought has put a hard limit on adaptation for almond growing.Most of the Middle East is experiencing high levels of water stress, expected to worsen the more the Earth warms, raising questions over how long those parts of the region will remain inhabitable. Vast swaths of Africa have also struggled in recent years with prolonged drought.  The report focuses on the interconnectedness between the Earth's ecosystems and humans, including how the climate crisis is altering water resources.\"What we really wanted to show is that ecosystems and all sectors of human society and human well-being fundamentally depends on water,\" Tabea Lissner, a scientist at Climate Analytics and an author on the report, told CNN. \"And it's not just the water resource itself that plays an important role in water security, but also what form and in what quality we can access it, and really showing how many different ways climate change really affects humans and ecosystems through various channels.\"The people who are least responsible are the most affectedFlooding in the Sudanese  capital of Khartoum on September 7, 2021.The countries that emit the least planet-warming gases, mainly those in the Global South and island territories, tend to be the ones disproportionately harmed by climate hazards, the report showed.\"We live in an unequal world,\" Eric Chu, an author of the report and scientist at University of California, Davis, told CNN. \"The losses are inequitably distributed among communities, especially those communities that have historically been disadvantaged from decision-making, and now we're seeing some of that inequality manifest as well in the choices we make to adapt.\"Camille Parmesan, an ecologist at CNRS Ecology Station and an author of the report, said as climate change worsens, more Indigenous people will lose the land, water and biodiversity they depend on. An overhead view of Ejit in the Marshall Islands, which are being increasingly overwhelmed by sea level rise.\"There's increasing evidence that many Indigenous communities that do rely a lot more on the natural systems for their food and their livelihoods are not only the most exposed, because those natural systems are being very heavily impacted, but they're the most vulnerable because often they're there in areas with high poverty or poor access to health care,\" Parmesan said.As the climate crisis advances, more people will be forced to relocate, adding stress and vulnerability to other regions.\"When the Earth doesn't become farmable, the dependence in the livelihood that communities have on farming and on production of food, not only will the incomes be lost, but that food security will be lost,\" said Vivek Shandas, a professor of climate adaptation and urban policy at Portland State University, who was not involved with the report. \"That ability to survive every day is lost. As humans, throughout history, we moved from places that are less habitable to places that are more attainable and habitable.\"We can still avoid the worstEmployees from Akfen Renewable Energy Group's Canakkale Wind Power Plant in Turkey do a routine maintenance check of equipment on the top of a wind turbine in December 2021.While many regions in the developing world are unable to adapt because of a lack of finance and capacity, the IPCC singles out North America as a region where misinformation and politicization are a barrier.That's led to a misunderstanding of how great the risk is, and has polarized the response to the crisis, ultimately \"delaying urgent adaptation planning and implementation,\" the report's authors say.In Europe, they note a lack of political leadership and a low sense of urgency are among the hurdles to overcome.But these are barriers that can be overcome, and the authors say there is still a window of opportunity to implement meaningful action \u2014 though it's closing, fast.  \"There are opportunities to adapt between now and 1.5 [degrees],\" in addition to making deep cuts to heat-trapping fossil fuel emissions, Chu said. \"But as we go beyond 1.5, the opportunity space becomes much more constrained and reduces the effectiveness.\"Lissner said the report is \"an urgent call for action\" for world leaders to move toward climate-resilient development: reducing emissions as low as possible while also investing in adaptation to cope with the changes we already see.Decision makers also need to be intentional in helping the most disadvantaged communities and countries, so no one gets left behind in the process. \"It's important for this to also be done in an inclusive or equitable manner,\" Lissner said, \"looking into how the most vulnerable regions can really be supported in adaptation.\"CNN's Angela Dewan contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Heat waves are the deadliest weather disaster in the US. They account for nearly 150 fatalities per year, more than hurricanes and tornadoes combined. New legislation in California hopes to reduce heat-related deaths by ranking heat waves similarly to hurricanes, by using categories and names. However, the National Weather Service (NWS) is currently in a multiyear experiment to also categorize heat waves.\"Globally, people are suffering from heat because of a deadly awareness gap,\" said Kurt Shickman, the director of Extreme Heat Initiatives at the Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center (Arsht-Rock), which is helping lead the legislative action. \"On one hand, there is still a low level of awareness of the risks of heat illness and death. People simply don't think of themselves as vulnerable. And on the other hand, heat quietly kills about half a million people per year globally, making it the deadliest natural disaster we face.\"Both the NWS and the groups behind the new measures are working to fix the deadly awareness gap.Read MoreLegislation to save livesThe new legislation proposed in California is in the form of two separate bills with one goal, to create a statewide heat ranking system, similar to the Saffir-Simpson scale used for hurricanes, to better prepare the public.\"Assembly Bill 2238 is tightly focused on preparing and safeguarding people from heat,\" Shickman said. \"Assembly Bill 2076 covers a broad set of heat efforts that will result in better heat resilience and mitigation.\"The bills would establish a Chief Heat Officer role, create an interagency heat task force and an extreme heat advisory council. 'Hotlanta' is even more sweltering in these neighborhoods due to a racist 20th-century policyShickman added there have also been discussions about naming heat waves.\"Putting a name to a heat wave is [supported] by studies on human behavior, psychology, and finding the right trigger to spur action to prepare for an extreme heat event,\" Shickman noted.Naming extreme temperature events could begin as early as this summer.\"Athens, Greece and Seville, Spain, are the first two cities globally to pilot heat wave naming and categorization beginning on May 1, 2022,\" Shickman pointed out. Arsht-Rock fully anticipates other cities, including those in the US, to similarly follow suit in the coming years.The bill also wants to categorize the heat waves into a simple numerical system.\"For example, people and authorities prepare and take action very differently when facing an imminent Category 1 versus a Category 5 hurricane,\" Shickman explained. \"This bill would give us the same capacity to encourage safer citizens in a similar way when facing heat.\" He argued there is merit to the effort because social scientists have noted humans tend to do better at deciphering simple messages rather than complex ones containing too many words.Matthew Bautista, 24, left, and friend Bobby Kraemer, 27, right, spend the morning at Surfrider Beach in Malibu as a spate of unseasonably warm weather continues on April 30, 2021, at Surfrider Beach in Malibu, California.\"It's important to make information easily accessible, easily digestible, and actionable,\" said Makenzie Krocak, a research scientist for the University of Oklahoma Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis. \"People are much more consistent about interpreting numbers. That doesn't necessarily mean that they are more likely to respond, but it does mean that interpretation is more consistent from person to person.\"However, the new categories and names would not necessarily come directly from the NWS, as weather information usually does. Instead, the legislation charges California's EPA for the naming and categorizing of the heat waves, but the NWS would provide the raw weather data to the EPA and would be the conduit for any of their warnings or messaging.\"We've made a great effort to design and pilot a categorization process for heat events that would work smoothly with the NWS process,\" Shickman said. \"We see categorization and the inclusion of human health outcomes as enhancements to a good warning system, not a replacement for it.\" Though Shickman also pointed out, \"We are not currently working with the National Weather Service, but would very much like to collaborate in the future.\"A similar system is currently in placeThe NWS has its own experimental \"HeatRisk tool\" currently in place.The tool provides a quick view of heat risk potential over the upcoming seven days, categorizing the heat both numerically (0-4) and with a color (green/yellow/orange/red/magenta), along with identifying groups potentially most at risk at each level.When #heatrisk reaches the magenta color it means a rare, dangerous, & very possibly deadly event. This is the case for Sunday - the hottest day of the holiday weekend. Don't take chances with heat - more people die from heat than all other weather hazards COMBINED! #LAheat #CAwx pic.twitter.com/lAo0aDmM2Z\u2014 NWS Los Angeles (@NWSLosAngeles) September 3, 2020\n\n\"Using this HeatRisk tool, we are able to move away from hard temperature thresholds and toward societal impacts when making decisions surrounding heat advisories, watches, and warnings.\" meteorologist Jenn Varian at the NWS office in Las Vegas said.Similarly, Shickman noted one of the main goals of the legislation is to \"establish categories for heat waves, based on how dangerous they are estimated to be for human health.\"The NWS developed the HeatRisk program in order to better assess the risks and allow people to prepare for upcoming heat events.\"We developed these categories based on climatology, but also based on collaborative work we've done with the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention],\" said Paul I\u00f1iguez, a Science and Operations Officer at the NWS office in Phoenix.Through collaboration, they were able to determine the yearly death toll caused by heat stroke and heat exhaustion.\"From there we were able to determine threshold temperatures of when you start to see impacts, the worse impacts from the heat, and that is how we determined our yellow level threshold,\" I\u00f1iguez explained.I\u00f1iguez and his colleagues surveyed several hundred locations across the country, then mapped the results to show the varied thresholds across the entire country.\"Just last year in Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located, there were 330 heat-related deaths,\" I\u00f1iguez pointed out. \"And as we know with climate change, locations are warming up. Phoenix and the Southwest are showing a drastic increase in temperature trends.\"People pose by an unofficial thermometer reading 132 degrees Fahrenheit/55 degrees Celsius at Furnace Creek Visitor Center on July 11, 2021 in Death Valley National Park, California. The program was developed nearly 10 years ago and became utilized in regional policy five years ago, I\u00f1iguez said. However, it is still in its experimental phase and will not become fully operational for another few years, which may line up with the timeline California wants to use. They would like their program to begin January 1, 2024, according to the legislation. Heat is relative to where you liveAn important thing to note is a number scale alone does not tell the whole story. \"As we've seen with hurricanes, the Saffir-Simpson scale only takes into account wind speed and not storm surge or flooding, and that causes some of the most damage from hurricanes, but that's not included in the category scale at all,\" said Dr. Peter D. Howe, an associate professor of geography at Utah State University.Miami broke its all-time heat record for June, but no warnings were issued. Here's why\"What I hope is these [new EPA] warnings take into account all possible dimensions of a heat event, so not just temperature but also humidity, the duration of the event, and nighttime low temperatures, things we know really cause a lot of the most serious health impacts.\"California is geographically complex, as the topography and climatology vary widely from one end of the state to the other.Both the highest elevation point and the lowest elevation point in the contiguous US are in California; Mount Whitney and Badwater Basin, respectively.\"Death Valley regularly exceeds 115 degrees in the summer, but areas like Mount Whitney do not,\" Varian said. \"So elevation, the type of terrain out West, and even the time of year play a major role in how we issue these excessive heat warnings.\"A few western NWS offices also take into account the number of tourists coming to the city and the transient population unaccustomed to extreme desert heat.As the abnormal heat increases, keep in mind any outdoor workers, travelers from colder climates, as well as those represented in vulnerable populations below!Secondly, children and pets should NEVER be left in vehicles parked in direct sunlight. Look before you lock! #cawx pic.twitter.com/14Ns1XJFPv\u2014 NWS San Diego (@NWSSanDiego) February 8, 2022\n\nIt could also be an issue if the system were to be implemented across other states.For example, in Columbia, South Carolina, the heat index must reach at least 110 degrees in order to have a heat advisory issued. However, in Minneapolis, a heat advisory is issued when the heat index only reaches 95 degrees.What is considered extreme heat in one city may be a normal summer day in another.\"100 degrees in Chicago is obviously going to be a much bigger deal, I\u00f1iguez said. \"In Phoenix, 100 degrees in July is actually going to be a below-normal day, so it's not going to be as drastically different to the climatology.\"What it all boils down to is how best to protect the public from various heat-related illnesses.Howe stressed communication and education will also be paramount. Media will need to communicate the new scale and educators will need to teach it to students, so they understand what it means. It may not matter what type of method they use, such as numbers, colors, or names, but rather the way they effectively communicate the new system.\"I think the main challenge is going to be making sure this system is used across the spectrum of people who are using it,\" Howe said. \"From broadcast meteorologists to local health departments, other local and state level folks such as the National Weather Service.\"Research shows messaging needs to be repeated early and often in order to be effective.CNN Meteorologist Haley Brink contributed to this story",

        "content": "(CNN)The Environmental Protection Agency faces a Supreme Court case on Monday that could deal a significant blow to the federal government's ability to fight the climate crisis and prevent its worst outcomes.  Republican attorneys general will argue the EPA has no authority to regulate planet-warming emissions from the power sector. Instead, they will say that authority should be given to Congress. The case also has enormous implications for Biden's climate agenda. With legislative action on climate looking uncertain at best, a Supreme Court decision siding with coal companies could undercut an important way the administration planned to slash emissions at a moment when scientists are sounding alarms about the accelerating pace of global warming.The power sector is the country's second-largest emitter of greenhouse gas. Power emissions rose last year, mainly driven by coal. Experts say West Virginia v. EPA is a highly unusual case, because there is no current EPA rule on power plant emissions. Plaintiffs are asking the court to block the EPA from implementing future rules. Read More\"All of this feels quite unprecedented,\" Jody Freeman, a Harvard Law School professor and former Obama administration official, told CNN. Here's what you need to know about the case and its possible outcomes. Who brought the lawsuit and what do they want? West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey is the main plaintiff in this case, joined by Republican attorneys general from more than a dozen other states. Morrisey's office is also representing two coal companies: The North American Coal Corporation, and Westmoreland Mining Holdings, LLC. The plaintiffs are challenging the EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions coming from power plants and saying this power should be taken away from the agency and given to Congress.  West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey speaks during a news conference on February 16.\"I think this is really about a fundamental question of who decides the major issues of the day,\" Morrisey said at a media event earlier this month. \"Should it be unelected bureaucrats, or should it be the people's representatives in Congress? That's what this case is all about.\" US power plants have historically generated electricity by burning coal; however, coal use is declining as renewables and natural gas have grown in the power sector.  West Virginia and several other plaintiff states are also coal mining states.  What do the defendants say? The US Solicitor General is representing the Biden administration and the EPA. Several environmental groups, Democratic lawmakers, power companies and their trade association have filed amicus briefs in support of the defendants. The Biden administration says the case should be dismissed, in large part because there is no federal regulation for power plants on the books right now. The Obama-era Clean Power Plan is long dead, as is the Trump-era Affordable Clean Energy rule that replaced it.  President Joe Biden's EPA hasn't yet issued its own rule to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and is expected to do so after February 28 oral arguments. \"Normally courts review actual regulations, and there is no regulation to review right now,\" New York University law professor and environmental law expert Ricky Revesz told CNN. \"Whatever the court does will involve speculation, and courts don't normally -- they stress this -- give advisory opinions. That's not what courts do.\" Who else is involved? In an interesting twist, some power companies are siding with EPA and will have the opportunity to argue their case directly during oral arguments.  The power sector is very nervous about the implications of repealing the EPA's regulatory authority. In its amicus brief, the industry's powerful trade group, Edison Electric Institute, said that stripping EPA of its authority \"would be chaos\" for its companies and open them up to constant litigation.  \"Instead of EPA utilizing its world of expert authority to craft regulations, our members would be thrown into a world of tort and nuisance suits,\" Alex Bond, deputy general counsel for climate and clean energy at EEI, told CNN. \"That's a world of tremendous risk and uncertainty.\" Legal experts and environmental groups are watching to see whether this argument from the power industry could strike a chord with conservative justices. \"I think the court is attentive to business,\" said Freeman. \"It is striking that the industry that is the one to be regulated is not the petitioner.\" What's being argued? The things being argued in front of the Supreme Court are quite broad.  Morrisey and other plaintiffs say the Clean Air Act doesn't explicitly say the EPA can regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. But rather than asking for limits on EPA's authority, are urging the Supreme Court to invoke two legal theories which would, in effect, give Congress the power to make decisions about regulating power plant emissions, instead of agencies. Greenland's ice is melting from the bottom up -- and far faster than previously thought, study shows\"These federal agencies don't have the ability to act on their own without getting a clear statement from Congress,\" Morrisey said at the media event. \"If you have something that's major, you have to make sure Congress steps in, and Congress gets to make these major decisions of the day.\" But legal experts say Congress already used its broad delegation power with the Clean Air Act, which has been reaffirmed by the Supreme Court itself. In two separate rulings -- one of them unanimous -- the Supreme Court found the EPA does have the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions (Massachusetts v. EPA and American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut). In addition, delegating this power to an already slow-moving branch of government could present an obvious logistical challenge. \"On the surface it sounds like a reasonable thing to say: Congress should speak clearly,\" said Freeman. \"But historically in practice we have taken 'broad delegation' as just that -- broad delegation\" to the agencies to make decisions.  What are the range of outcomes?The conservative supermajority makes the outcome of this case tough to predict, but there are a few possibilities. Biden administration freezes new oil and gas drilling leases after court rules against key climate toolCase dismissal: In its brief, the US Solicitor General's Office asks the Supreme Court to dismiss the case, saying the Republican state attorneys general and coal companies lack standing because there's no EPA regulation currently in effect. Administration lawyers are also proposing the court could vacate and nullify the DC Circuit Court's January 2021 ruling that spurred West Virginia's challenge. In effect, that could wipe the slate clean and allow Biden's EPA to proceed with its own power plant rules. A narrow ruling: The court could issue a narrower ruling that allows EPA to keep its authority to regulate, but says the agency can only issue rulings that impacts power companies \"inside the fence.\" This would restrict EPA to narrower regulations that power plants could achieve inside their own fence lines -- like carbon capture -- rather than pushing them to add cleaner sources of energy. EPA's worst-case scenario: The court could overturn Massachusetts v. EPA and give the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants to Congress.  Are there justices to watch? Most of the action will be on the court's conservative bench.  Defendants, plaintiffs and outside experts say they'll be watching the court's newest justices: Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh, and Neil Gorsuch. Barrett is a bit of an unknown when it comes to environmental law, experts told CNN. \"I think everybody's bet is she would tend to be more skeptical of broad agency authority,\" Freeman said.",

(CNN)As a space enthusiast, I've always wanted to sail among the stars to a galaxy far, far away.I got a step closer this week when I boarded the Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser at Walt Disney World for a preview of the first-of-its-kind immersive experience, opening on March 1. As a Star Wars fan, I was delighted to interact with characters new and old and live out a choose-your-own adventure at a resort simulating a cruise among the stars. Joining a secret mission, I trained with a lightsaber, traded messages with spunky droids and helped Chewbacca sneak around the ship to aid Rey and the Resistance against the First Order.But my breath caught as I stepped inside my cabin and beheld a window with a constant view of shimmering stars, asteroid fields, passing ships and a dazzling array of planets. Standing on the ship's bridge, I spied sparks of lightning as storms brewed in the tumultuous clouds of Bespin, a planet familiar to fans of \"The Empire Strikes Back.\"As a science journalist, I've often imagined what it might be like to travel to space. Now, I finally know -- sort of, just with more gravity, and of course, the Force. Read MoreSolar updateThe Full Sun Imager onboard the ESA/NASA Solar Orbiter spacecraft captured a giant solar eruption on February 15.A spacecraft studying the sun was in the right place at the right time when our star decided to have a bit of a temper tantrum. The Solar Orbiter found itself in the perfect position to capture an unprecedented image of a massive solar eruption on February 15.The striking event extended millions of miles into space from the sun -- and luckily, it was traveling away from Earth rather than toward us.It's another sign that our sun is getting more active as it builds toward a peak of stormy activity in 2025.Fossils and fireballsImagine enjoying a nice, sunny day when, all of a sudden, a 33-foot-high (10-meter-high) wall of water comes rushing in while fiery spheres of glass rain down. This is likely what happened to the dinosaurs 66 million years ago when a city-size asteroid struck the planet. The cataclysmic impact took place during springtime in our world's Northern Hemisphere, according to new research. Scientists made this determination after studying the bones of paddlefish preserved in rocks in North Dakota. The fish died within an hour of the event.\"This deposit literally looks like a car crash frozen in place. It looks like the most violent thing I have ever seen, preserved in pristine condition,\" one of the researchers said.A long time agoThese jars were recovered from a site near Cairo.Hundreds of pottery jars and other tools used for embalming have been recovered deep inside a cemetery shaft near Cairo. Ancient Egyptians used these for storage as they prepared the bodies of the dead for the afterlife more than 2,500 years ago. Researchers are trying to learn more about the jars and the intriguing inscriptions they bear to determine who owned them.Meanwhile, flattened stones and spiky clay balls sitting in a Japanese museum have shed light on the origins of throwing stars. These throwing weapons were used by ninjas, the mysterious covert agents of feudal Japan, 430 years ago.Across the universeSay hello to 1 million newly discovered space objects. These are just some of the 4.4 million objects newly mapped by astronomers that are billions of miles away from our corner of the universe.

As meltwater falls from the top, gravity creates kinetic energy that warms water pooling at the base. The Greenland ice sheet produces more energy than the world's 10 largest hydroelectric dams combined, new research revealed.But instead of generating electricity, this is speeding up the melting process.The wonderYou won't believe your eyes:-- A doghouse, once the home of a German Shepherd named Roky, was struck by a meteorite fragment in April 2019 and sold during an online Christie's auction this week. -- An \"exceedingly rare\" fossil belonging to a giant flying reptile was found on the shore of the Isle of Skye.

        "content": "Abu Dhabi (CNN)Less than a month into his presidency, the White House said Joe Biden would \"recalibrate\" his relationship with Saudi Arabia, effectively refusing to speak to the Kingdom's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.  Biden would speak with his counterpart, 86-year-old King Salman, said White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki last February. It is the crown prince, however, who handles day-to-day affairs of the kingdom, including oil policy.  But a lot has changed over the past 12 months. Inflation is now at its highest in 40 years, midterm elections loom and Russia has just plunged Europe into its biggest security crisis in decades by invading Ukraine. But perhaps most importantly for America's relationship with the Middle East, oil prices have soared above $100 to an eight-year high.  Brent crude breached $100 per barrel for the first time since 2014 Thursday after Russian troops attacked Ukraine. Western states are now scrambling to find alternative sources of energy should Russia's vast supplies of oil and gas be interrupted.   Biden's appeals for more oil from OPEC's de-facto leader Saudi Arabia have thus far been rebuffed by King Salman, who has pledged to stick to the oil cartel's pact with Russia to limit production hikes. The kingdom has about 2 million barrels of spare capacity.  Read MoreBut as diplomacy broke down with Russia over the past week, progress was made on another front, in Vienna, where world powers have been negotiating with Iran to revive a 2015 nuclear agreement that President Donald Trump abandoned in 2018. A conclusion of the agreement could give Washington and global oil markets much needed reprieve by releasing Iranian oil that was sanctioned by the United States.  Biden is now faced with a dilemma. Does he reconsider his refusal to call the crown prince of his closest Middle East partner and make a new appeal to Saudi Arabia? Or might he find an unlikely savior in his biggest Middle East foe, Iran?  How Putin's attack on Ukraine unfolded inside the White HouseBiden's issue with the crown prince is personal, said Abdulaziz Sager, chairman of the Saudi-based Gulf Research Center. \"If you have something that you wanted to deliver to Saudi, as a message, or to the crown prince, say it loud and clear. Say this is what you want,\" he said. \"It's only logical\" for the US to change its approach to Saudi Arabia with oil at $100, he added.  But even if Saudi Arabia agrees to raise output, will that relieve pressure on oil prices? Not necessarily, said Ellen Ward, senior non-resident fellow at Washington's Atlantic Council. \"The [OPEC] oil ministers have indicated that they are skeptical about the ability to set prices precisely simply by increasing production,\" she said. \"In other words, the causes of the recent rise in oil prices are due more to financial speculation and geopolitical risk than a lack of supply.\"  And even if Biden makes that much anticipated call to the crown prince, \"there is no indication that Mohammed bin Salman would capitulate because of a personal request,\" she added.   If the Russia-Ukraine crisis drives oil to about $110 a barrel, US inflation would exceed 10% on a year-over-year basis, according to consulting firm RSM. That hasn't happened in the US since 1981 and would cause a \"real short-term shock,\" it said.   The predicament Biden faces won't go unnoticed in Tehran, possibly strengthening its hand at the Vienna negotiations. On Wednesday, it recalled its top negotiator for consultations and called on the West to be \"realistic\" about talks.  S&P Global Platts expects that an interim nuclear deal could allow Iranian exports to grow by 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) in April and May, while a comprehensive agreement could allow 1.5 million bpd of export growth within nine months. Iran pumped 3.83 million bpd before Trump's pullout from the nuclear pact in 2018.  \"Every US president used to lobby Saudi Arabia to increase production,\" and the kingdom often obliged, said Yousef Alshammari, senior research fellow at London's Imperial College. \"During the past four years we saw Saudi Arabia either raising production or making voluntary cuts during the Trump era. But now the kingdom is sticking to a more standard approach.\"  The more Biden \"personalizes\" his dispute with Saudi Arabia, the more it will force the kingdom to seek strategic alternatives to the US, Sager said.   \"I don't think that Saudi Arabia is going to allow the situation between the US and Russia to jeopardize its relationship with Russia,\" said Ward. \"The energy relationship between Saudi Arabia and Russia exists outside of the geopolitical issues between Russia and Ukraine and as long as Saudi Arabia can remain above the situation without having to choose sides, it will likely refrain from even commenting on Russia's actions in eastern Ukraine.\" Other top Middle East news UAE to buy Chinese fighter jets as it 'diversifies military capabilities' The UAE said on Tuesday it will order 12 L-15 planes from China, with the option of ordering 36 more, as it continues to \"diversify and modernize\" its military capabilities.  Background: In December, the UAE suspended a multi-billion-dollar deal to buy US-made F-35 fighter jets. That month, it also placed a $19 billion order for 80 French Rafale fighter jets and 12 military helicopters. Why it matters: The decision is a sign of Abu Dhabi's growing frustration with Washington's attempts to limit Chinese technology sales to the Gulf state. The UAE has been skeptical about US claims of potential security breaches and has expressed anxiety about getting caught up in a \"new cold war\" between a top trading partner and its main strategic ally. Iraq's requirement to pay victims of 1990 Kuwait invasion ends after three decades The UN Security Council voted unanimously on Tuesday to end a three-decade-long requirement for Iraq to compensate people in Kuwait affected by Saddam Hussein's invasion in 1990.  Background: More than $50 billion was paid out by Iraq through a fund set up by the UN to cover losses and damages suffered as a direct result of the 1990-1991 Gulf War. The last chunk of payment was submitted last week.  Why it matters: Since the overthrow of Hussein in 2003, Iraq has worked to shift its regional policy to repair ties with former adversaries. The end of reparations to Kuwait marks a symbolic end from the foreign policy of the Hussein era.  Qatar says replacing Russian gas to Europe quickly is 'almost impossible' Qatar's Energy Minister Saad Sherida al-Kaabi said that 10% to 15% of the country's long-term gas exports are divertible away from existing customers, as Western nations continue talks over a Russian gas substitute to Europe following the invasion of Ukraine.  Background: Qatar and other countries such as Japan have recently been approached by the US to reroute gas supplies to Europe in case conflict between Russia and Ukraine escalates. Why it matters: A large proportion of Europe's gas supplies come from Russia. Kaabi's comments renewed concerns over Europe's security of gas supplies as the US and its allies race to draw up contingency plans. Around the regionThe WaterWill startup provides clean water to those who can't afford it, here in Minya, Egypt.Having access to clean drinkable water is often taken for granted. For some in rural Africa, however, it can be a real challenge. More than 2 billion people globally do not have access to clean drinkable water, according to a 2019 report from the World Health Organization and the UN Children's Fund.  The Middle East and North Africa region is reported to be the most water-scarce in the world. In Egypt, nearly 57% of people live in poverty-struck rural areas, where access to clean, affordable water is a luxury. An Egyptian social startup is trying to change that.  \"Water is a very basic need that everyone in the world should have,\" says Mohannad Hisham, founder of WaterWill, which says it aims to create sustainable and affordable water solutions in Africa. Hisham founded \"WaterWill\" in 2019, and in 2021, came up with an initiative called \"Buy Me Filter\" to manufacture eco-friendly and affordable water filters. \"The idea of the filters is to be cost-efficient and sustainable,\" says Hisham. The filter costs 300 Egyptian pounds ($19); the average Egyptian family makes around $321 per month, according to official statistics. The filter is made from local resources. Clay is the main ingredient, molded into a candle that is treated with nano silver particles that kill bacteria and germs. It's designed to clear water of diseases and microbes, killing 99.9% of bacteria, according to Hisham, and is meant to last for two years without maintenance. \"Our ultimate goal is to work with as many rural communities in Egypt and Africa, giving everyone and each one access to clean water which is their basic right,\" says Hisham.

        "content": "London (CNN Business)The West is promising \"massive\" sanctions on Moscow in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron said Thursday that European sanctions would target Russia's military, economy and energy, and Germany's decision this week to halt certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline built by Russia's Gazprom shows that the vast oil and gas sector isn't off limits.But any action that affects Russia's energy interests will highlight the role played by some of the West's biggest players, which have generated billions of dollars for the Russian state and are among the country's leading foreign investors. Here's how ExxonMobil (XOM), BP (BP) and Shell (RDSA) are helping keep Russia's oil-dependent economy afloat. ExxonMobilRead MoreThe American oil giant has more than 1,000 employees in Russia, and has been in the country for over 25 years. Its subsidiary, Exxon Neftegas Limited (ENL), has a 30% stake in Sakhalin-1 \u2014 a vast oil and natural gas project located off Sakhalin Island in the Russian Far East. It has operated the project since 1995 on behalf of a consortium that includes Japanese and Indian partners, as well as two affiliates of Russia's largest oil company, Rosneft. ENL employs more than 700 Russian nationals at five major sites and production locations. ExxonMobil also has offices in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Since its startup, Sakhalin-1 has generated more than $18.3 billion in payments to Russian federal and regional governments. Russia isn't as important to ExxonMobil as it used to be, however.ExxonMobil previously partnered with Rosneft to conduct exploration and research activities in Russia but withdrew from those joint ventures after sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.It valued its Russian assets at $4 billion in its annual financial report released Wednesday. That represented less than 2% of its fossil fuel assets. The word \"Russia\" was not mentioned in its recent earnings call with analysts.ExxonMobil did not immediately respond to a request for comment.BPOn its website, BP proclaims itself \"one of the biggest foreign investors in Russia.\"That investment largely takes the form of a strategic partnership with Rosneft, in which it owns a 19.75% stake. The British company gets to nominate two directors to the Rosneft board \u2014 BP CEO Bernard Looney and former CEO Bob Dudley. The Russian government is Rosneft's biggest shareholder.Through three joint ventures with Rosneft, BP owns a 20% stake in the Taas-Yuryakh oil project in eastern Siberia. BP completed the deal to acquire that stake in 2015, and production from the project was expected to reach 100,000 barrels per day last year. BP also owns 49% of Yermak Neftegaz \u2014 formed in 2016 \u2014 which is conducting onshore exploration over a combined area of about 260,000 square kilometers in the West Siberian and Yenisey-Khatanga basins.The third joint venture covers the Kharampur project, in which BP has a 49% interest. Kharampur is a mature oil field but BP and Rosneft are planning to develop the project to pump gas. BP says there is potential to \"double overall field production.\"BP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The tanker Sun Arrows loads its cargo of liquefied natural gas from the Sakhalin-2 project in the port of Prigorodnoye, Russia, on Friday, Oct. 29, 2021. ShellThe UK-based company's biggest engagement in Russia is Sakhalin-2, which it describes as one of the world's largest integrated oil and gas projects.Shell has a 27.5% stake in the venture, which is controlled by Gazprom. Other investors include Mitsui (MITSY) and Mitsubishi of Japan. The project includes three offshore platforms, an onshore processing facility, 300 kilometers (186 miles) of offshore pipelines and 1,600 kilometers (994 miles) of onshore pipelines, an oil export terminal and a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant.Shell says Sakhalin-2 supplies about 4% of the world's current LNG market. Japan, South Korea and China are the main customers for oil and LNG exports.A Shell spokesperson said it was monitoring the situation closely, but declined to comment on the company's investments in Russia.\u2014 Chris Liakos and Chris Isidore contributed reporting.",

        "content": "(CNN)Climate advocates are sounding the alarm ahead of Biden's Tuesday State of the Union speech amid what they see as slow action on the climate crisis. Now that President Joe Biden's signature climate bill is effectively dead, and with little momentum in Congress to revive it, these groups are applying pressure at the start of what they say is a make-or-break year for climate action. \"It's time to go faster,\" Sam Ricketts, co-founder and co-director for climate group Evergreen Action, told CNN. \"You're going to need to see federal agencies to do things more aggressive, more climate-oriented than they've ever done before.\" Biden administration freezes new oil and gas drilling leases after court rules against key climate toolEvergreen on Thursday is releasing a report, shared first with CNN, detailing specific actions it wants to see from the Biden administration to meet the President's goal of cutting the country's planet-warming emissions in half by 2030. The group wants the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, fossil-fuel burning appliances and the industrial sector. It also wants to see new appliance efficiency standards from the Department of Energy. And it's urging the Department of Interior to \"do everything possible to end all new onshore and offshore leasing.\" Read MoreRicketts told CNN Evergreen is not pushing for increased executive action in lieu of Congressional action -- they want both. As their report details, \"multiple analyses have shown that these investments will need to be complemented by executive action if the US is going to reach this 2030 goal.\" Cities tried to cut natural gas from new homes. The GOP and gas lobby preemptively quashed their effort\"The job isn't done; failure's not an option,\" Ricketts said. Evergreen isn't the only group that's applying pressure ahead of the State of the Union. Climate Power also shared first with CNN its plan to spend over $600,000 on new ads touting clean energy to run nationwide. The ads will run on several TV networks, stations and news websites, including CNN, MSNBC and Axios.The Center for American Progress will release an analysis the average consumer could save hundreds of dollars a year on energy costs if the government invests significantly in renewables like wind and solar. \"It's just connecting the dots for folks,\" Lori Lodes, executive director of Climate Power told CNN. \"We have a very narrow window if we're going to lower emissions as much as we must. Because of all the advances in clean energy, it's the cheapest energy source right now. And if we invest in it, it's going to get cheaper.\"  2022 is a decisive year Biden began his presidency by promising to tackle the climate crisis. In its first year, the administration introduced regulations to raise fuel mileage standards, phased out hydrofluorocarbons and passed a bipartisan infrastructure bill that included $7.5 billion for a network of electric-vehicle charging stations around the country.But climate groups haven't gotten what they really want: Major legislation.Greenland's ice is melting from the bottom up -- and far faster than previously thought, study showsOver $550 billion in climate and clean energy provisions were tucked into the Build Back Better Act, which is no longer being considered by the Senate. While some Senate Democrats are hopeful that a smaller, climate-central bill can be agreed on, there's not much forward momentum in Congress.  With the clock running out for the 2022 midterms, climate advocates are getting nervous. \"Where we are right now as a climate movement is feeling pretty panicked, I would say,\" Christy Goldfuss, senior vice president for Energy and Environment Policy at the Center for American Progress told CNN. While all advocates CNN spoke to said strong administrative action is important, Goldfuss and others stressed Congress should pass significant investments in clean energy, especially $320 billion worth of clean energy tax credits in Biden's bill, to help pave the way for regulation. They said Biden's infrastructure bill, while a starting point, is not the whole ballgame.  Build Back Better's climate commitments are \"also what's going to help the average household and business in their bottom line,\" said Ryan Fitzpatrick, director of the Climate and Energy Program at center-left think tank Third Way. \"We need to make sure we follow through with the second part of the agenda.\" What is black carbon? The latest way humans are causing changes in AntarcticaAs a new geopolitical crisis unfolds in Europe with potential repercussions for rising gas prices, other climate groups told CNN Biden and Congressional Democrats can't lose focus on passing clean energy provisions to help Americans transition away from fossil fuels. \"We need to see the White House and climate champions in Congress really make the case for investing in renewables at home now, as an answer to the fossil fuel fluctuations we see every decade, basically,\" said Goldfuss. \"What we're seeing now that we're facing inflation is just how important those climate investments are in driving down energy costs.\" The courts pose another potential roadblock for the administration. Republican attorneys general have already sued to block some of Biden's climate initiatives, and the administration is facing a major US Supreme Court case over power plant emissions regulations -- even though it has not yet implemented its own power plant rules.  Ricketts said that even with a tough legal landscape, Biden's agencies should forge ahead with bold steps to bring down carbon emissions dramatically.  \"The administration can only do what the administration can do,\" Ricketts said. \"They can't and should not anticipate future roadblocks and use those as excuses not to do something. They've got to use every tool they've got access to.\"",

He did not break into the garage, however, which is where the trash was kept.Read MoreOfficers banged on the exterior of the home until he left through the back door. On February 18, Hank broke through a small window and squeezed his way into a home.And Saturday, he is believed to have broken down a front door to enter another home. Police said they haven't confirmed the bear is Hank yet, but believe it is likely him.There have been no direct attacks on humans or pets in the area, the fish and wildlife department said.Residents have flooded police lines with worried calls, and the wildlife department said more than 100 individual reports of the bear have been come in to South Lake Tahoe police. Wildlife department spokesperson Peter Tira told CNN they have been tracking incidents with this black bear since the spring of 2021.\"The incidents primarily occurred during the summer and fall of 2021, when the bear was in hyperphagia, adding calories to survive the winter,\" Tira said. Hyperphagia, according to the US National Park Service, causes bears to eat and drink nearly nonstop during the fall in preparation for hibernation.A South Lake Tahoe police officer's foot next to Hank's footprint shows the bear's large size.This bear, according to CDFW, has lost its fear of people, and is associating people with access to food. His large size helps him break into homes as he can push through front doors and garage doors.In October, a California woman was mauled by a different black bear that broke into her northern Lake Tahoe cabin and rummaged through her kitchen. The woman suffered scratches and other wounds all over her body.There are a few options to keep the community and bear safe: relocation, placing the bear in a facility, or euthanasia. This last option has local bear advocacy groups such as BEAR League concerned.Ann Bryant, executive director of the group, told CNN affiliate KCRA the bear does not have to die.You come across a bear. Your next move is very important. Do you know what to do?\"The BEAR League reached out to the director of an excellent out-of-state wildlife sanctuary who agreed he has room and would be very willing to give this bear a permanent home,\" Bryant told KCRA.However, the wildlife department said relocation comes with a lot of requirements and can take a toll on the animal's mental health.According to KCRA, the BEAR League group has offered to pay all relocation expenses.\"While the Lake Tahoe area has a healthy and dense bear population, euthanizing an animal is always our last option,\" Tira said.If the wildlife department does capture the bear, it said it will evaluate the possibility of moving him to the out-of-state facility. It said his current location, as of Friday, is unknown, but the last reported sighting was a few days ago when he was seen walking down a street in Tahoe Keys.The department is advising residents in the area to stay vigilant and responsibly store and dispose of food, as bears are driven by scent.",

        "content": "(CNN)The US Postal Service is moving ahead with a plan to replace its current fleet with 90% gas-powered trucks and 10% battery electric vehicles, after the Environmental Protection Agency and White House objected to the move and asked for further study of the impact of emissions. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy reiterated that the Postal Service currently doesn't have the funding available to increase the number of electric vehicles in its fleet. \"As we have reiterated throughout this process, our commitment to an electric fleet remains ambitious given the pressing vehicle and safety needs of our aging fleet as well as our fragile financial condition,\" DeJoy, who was selected for the Postmaster General role during the Trump administration, said in a statement. \"The process needs to keep moving forward.\"In a letter sent earlier this month, EPA associate administrator Vicki Arroyo said the USPS plan was \"inconsistent\" with clean-energy policies at state, federal and international levels, and called it a \"crucial lost opportunity to more rapidly reduce the carbon footprint of one of the largest government fleets in the world.\"Brenda Mallory, chair of the White House Council of Environmental Quality, penned a separate letter urging USPS to improve its environmental review in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act and adding that the agency could face repercussions from Congress or the courts if it failed to do so.Read MoreDespite their objections, the EPA and the White House can't stop the USPS plan from happening; the USPS is an independent agency responsible for funding itself.  In a statement, Mark Guilfoil, vice president for supply management at USPS, said the agency \"determined that EPA's request for a supplemental [environmental impact statement] and public hearing would not add value to the Postal Service's already year-long review,\" adding that neither were legally required.  USPS said it will leave some flexibility to increase the number of EVs in the fleet \"as financial resources become available.\"Adrian Martinez, a senior attorney at the environmental law group Earthjustice, said environmental groups would pursue litigation to get USPS to reverse course. \"DeJoy's environmental review is rickety, founded on suspect calculations, and fails to meet the standards of the law,\" Martinez said. \"We're not done fighting this reckless decision.\" CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct DeJoy's connection to Trump.

        "content": "(CNN)Wildfires have intensified around the globe, providing a stark reminder of how the climate crisis is upending lives and inflicting billions of dollars a year in damage. And it will only get worse, according to dozens of global fire experts. A report released Wednesday by the UN Environment Programme suggests it's time we \"learn to live with fire\" and adapt to the uptick in the frequency and severity of wildfires that will inevitably put more lives and economies in harm's way.Exclusive: Experts say the term 'drought' may be insufficient to capture what is happening in the WestThe number of extreme wildfire events will increase up to 14% by 2030, according to the report's analysis. By 2050, the increase will climb to 30%.Even with the most ambitious efforts to slash heat-trapping emissions, the report shows that those near-term consequences are locked in. Although the situation is dire and that eliminating wildfire risks is impossible, communities can still reduce their risk and exposure, said Andrew Sullivan, principal research officer with Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization and editor of the report.Read More\"Uncontrollable and devastating wildfires are becoming an expected part of the seasonal calendars in many parts of the world,\" Sullivan said at a Monday news conference. \"Where wildfires have historically occurred, they may increase; however, where wildfires have not historically occurred, they may become more common.\"A large bushfire is seen from Bargo, Australia, southwest of Sydney in December 2019. A state of emergency was declared in Australia's most populated region that month as an unprecedented heatwave fanned out-of-control bushfires, destroying homes and smothering huge areas with a toxic smoke.Wildfires affect every aspect of society including public health, livelihoods, biodiversity and the already changing climate. UNEP researchers, including over 50 experts from universities, government agencies and international organizations around the world, say the report serves as a \"roadmap\" for adapting to a burning world. The changing pattern of wildfiresFires have always served a vital ecological purpose on Earth, essential for many ecosystems. They restore the soil's nutrients, helping germinate plants and remove decaying matter. Without fires, overgrown foliage like grasses and shrubs can prime the landscape for worse flare-ups, particularly during extreme drought and heat waves. Burning parts of the land on purpose has historically prevented larger, more destructive fires. Indigenous people have been applying this preventative method, known as controlled or prescribed burns, for thousands of years.A firefighter battles flames during the Creek fire in the Cascadel Woods area of unincorporated Madera County, California, in  September 2020.But as humans warmed the planet, developed more land and created fire suppression policies while neglecting forest management, wildfires have become more deadly and destructive than ever before. These factors, according to the UNEP report, drastically changed the fire regime.Wildfires now burn longer and are becoming hotter in places where they have always occurred; meanwhile, fires are also igniting and spreading in unexpected places, including wetlands, drying peatlands and on thawing permafrost in the Arctic. What is black carbon? The latest way humans are causing changes in Antarctica\"What is eye catching is that there are ecosystems now that start to burn that we did not expect in that intensity,\" Tim Christophersen, head of the Nature for Climate Branch at UNEP, told CNN. \"For example, there's a lot more wetlands which, as they're called, you would think that they don't catch fire easily. We see more and more fires also in the Arctic Circle, where fires are naturally rare.\"Wildfires, which are often ignited by lightning strikes or human activity, are becoming more frequent because of human-caused climate change. Scientists found, for instance, that climate change made the extreme weather conditions that fueled the 2019-2020 destructive fire seasons in Australia 30% more likely to occur. Additionally, a recent study found that high-elevation forests in the Rocky Mountains are burning more now than any time in the past 2,000 years. In the last two years, wildfires in the US West were exhibiting extreme fire behavior and wafting smoke across the country while also creating their own weather.A hazy San Francisco skyline is seen from Dolores Park in September 2020 as more than 300,000 acres burned across the state.Fires are also increasingly harming public health. A recent study found that the annual exposure to wildfire smoke results in more than 30,000 deaths across the 43 countries analyzed in the study. Another study found that increases in fine particulate matter from wildfire smoke in 2020 led to a surge in Covid-19 cases and deaths in California, Oregon and Washington.Wildfires have also become more costly. In the US, the UNEP report noted data from the National Interagency Fire Center that shows that average annual federal firefighting costs have skyrocketed to $1.9 billion as of 2020 -- a rise of more than 170% in a decade. Researchers say governments aren't learning from the past, and they are perpetuating conditions that are not environmentally and economically beneficial for the future.\"The world needs to change its stance towards wildfires -- from reactive to proactive -- because wildfires are going to increase in frequency and intensity due to climate change,\" Christophersen said. \"That means we all have to be better prepared.\"A shift in thinkingThe report predicts that the likelihood of intense events, similar to those seen in Australia's so-called Black Summer wildfires in 2019 and 2020 or the record-setting Arctic fires in 2020, will increase by up to 57% by the end of the century. And because of the ever-shifting conditions in which wildfires now occur, researchers say authorities and policy-makers need to work in tandem with local communities, bring back Indigenous knowledge and invest money to prevent wildfires from igniting in the first place to reduce the damage and loss that comes after. A forest fire in central Yakutia, Russia, in June 2020.UNEP researchers suggest that governments adopt a \"fire ready formula,\" which commits two-thirds of spending to planning, prevention, preparedness and recovery, with only a smaller percentage put toward response to damages and losses. Greenland's ice is melting from the bottom up -- and far faster than previously thought, study shows\"This formula needs to be fine-tuned to each regional and national context,\" Christophersen said. \"But in general, it's a shift away from investing only in the response and more into prevention, planning and recovery.\"Christophersen added that building stronger regional and international cooperation to help other countries is crucial as well.\"Some countries are more advanced in this than others and they can share their knowledge with other countries,\" he said. \"At the moment, what keeps me up at night is that there's no real global response yet, so we need more investments also in that kind of a global platform.\"The report acknowledges that the UN system itself \"lacks robust wildfire expertise dedicated to this challenge,\" which they plan to change through a series of initiatives that would help countries.",

Even the smallest amounts of the dark pollutant can have a significant impact on melting because of its very low \"albedo,\" or reflectiveness: things that are light in color, like snow, reflect the sun's energy and stay cool; things that are dark, like black carbon, absorb the sun's energy and warm up.Take bright, white snow and sprinkle some black pollution on it, and it's a recipe for melting. Read MoreAnd what happens in Antarctica has global repercussions. It's a massive, white continent that reflects a significant amount of the sun's energy back to space. Losing ice and snow cover means land and ocean temperatures warm further, and that again causes more melting, in what becomes a vicious cycle of climate change. \"(Antarctica) is currently one of the most rapidly warming regions on the planet,\" said Alia Khan, a snow and ice scientist at Western Washington University. \"Snow is already melting due to impacts of climate change, but this is an exacerbating factor on snow melt.\"Penguins are seen with a cruise ship in the background in Antarctica. Roughly 74,000 tourists visited Antarctica during the summer of 2019-2020, more than twice as many as a decade ago, according to the IAATO.The researchers sampled snow around tourist sites and research-heavy locations from 2016 to 2020 and found the black carbon found in those samples was considerably more abundant than levels measured elsewhere on the continent. The research found the highest levels of soot were measured near the Argentine research station in Hope Bay on the Trinity Peninsula, near the northern most part of Antarctica.\"(Tourist) ships in Antarctica generally use less-polluting marine diesel, and some vessels are supplementing fuel with battery power,\" the study said. But the researchers note that their results show there's more to be done to reduce pollution as tourism continues to increase. The Ukraine conflict has put a major gas pipeline on the scrap heap. Here's why that mattersRoughly 74,000 tourists visited Antarctica during the summer of 2019-2020, the researchers reported, a 32% increase from 2018-2019 and more than twice as many as a decade ago.Khan said this study was important not just to understand what's happening in Antarctica, but because global climate models \u2014 which scientists use to predict environmental changes decades and centuries in advance \u2014 need a better grasp on the impact of snow albedo on the climate system.\"The snow albedo effect is one of the largest uncertainties in regional and global climate modeling right now,\" Khan told CNN. \"That's one of the motivations for the study, to quantify the impact of black carbon in Antarctica due to local emissions from research and tourist activities on regional snowmelt, which is important for quantifying the role of black carbon in the global loss of snow and ice.\"Marilyn Raphael, a geography professor and director of UCLA's Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, explained that messing with the Antarctic could throw our planet's delicate balance out of whack.Exclusive: Experts say the term 'drought' may be insufficient to capture what is happening in the West\"[Antarctica] is sitting there pretty much silently all year. But, if it weren't there, in the state that it is meant to be, the balance that we have in the climate system \u2014 the balance that we enjoy in the Northern Hemisphere \u2014 will no longer be,\" Raphael said.Tuesday's study comes alongside an alarming record in Antarctica: the area of ocean covered by sea ice around the continent will hit a new low this year. Raphael said changes in sea ice, too, could have a global reach. Antarctica's sea ice is also important to maintain a balance in atmospheric circulation, Raphael said. This circulation drives the winds and is the means by which energy is transported into or out of the continent.\"If the atmospheric circulation changes, the global climate changes,\" she said.As waters get warmer and sea ice depletes, some Antarctic creatures are finding their homes more and more unlivable. Penguin colonies in Antarctica, for example, rely heavily on krill in their diets, and the krill rely on sea ice. Scientists have seen a shocking decline in penguin colonies recently, as krill becomes harder to find. \"Everything we do has consequences,\" Raphael said. \"We need to educate ourselves about those consequences, especially in systems that we know relatively little about. We have to be careful that we don't upset the climate balance.\"This story has been updated with additional information.",

        "content": "(CNN)The ice sheet covering Greenland is melting rapidly at its base and is injecting far more water and ice into the ocean than previously understood, according to new research, which could have serious ramifications for global sea level rise. \"Unprecedented\" rates of melting have been observed at the bottom of the ice sheet, caused by huge quantities of meltwater falling down from the surface, according to the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. As the meltwater falls, its gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic energy, which ultimately warms the water as it pools at the base of the ice sheet. In that process, the study found that the Greenland ice sheet produces more energy than the world's 10 largest hydroelectric dams combined.\"However, the heat generated by the falling water is not used to generate electricity. Instead, it melts the ice,\" Poul Christoffersen, a Canmridge University senior scientist who took part in the study, told CNN. Meltwater on the surface of the ice sheet falls through cracks to the base.During warmer months, meltwater pools into lakes and streams on the surface of the ice sheet. Some of that water drains to the bottom of the ice sheet, falling through cracks and large fractures that form in the ice with movement and stress.Read MoreThat meltwater contributes to more melting at the bottom of the ice sheet, and it also behaves as a lubricant that promotes faster flow and increases the quantity of ice discharged into the ocean.What is black carbon? The latest way humans are causing changes in AntarcticaChristoffersen explained that when researching the melting of ice sheet and glaciers at their bases, studies tended to focus on external heat sources. \"But what we hadn't really looked at was the heat generated by the draining meltwater itself,\" he said. \"There's a lot of energy stored in the water that forms on the surface, and when it falls, the energy has to go somewhere.\"The Greenland ice sheet is the second largest in the world and is already the biggest single contributor to global sea level rise. \"The ice in Greenland is melting on the surface faster than the snowfall can keep up with, so there is quite a big loss from the melting,\" Christoffersen told CNN. \"In a substantial part of the ice, we get melt rates which can be up to five or six centimeters a day.\" However, directly measuring conditions at the base -- around 1 kilometer below the surface -- poses challenges, particularly in Greenland, where glaciers are among the world's fastest-moving.\"Unprecedented\" rates of melting have been observed at the bottom of the ice sheet.The Cambridge researchers teamed up with scientists at the University of California Santa Cruz and the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland for this study. It focused on the Store Glacier, a large outlet from the Greenland ice sheet. Antarctica will likely set an alarming new record this year, new data showsTo measure the melt rates, the researchers used a technique developed at the British Antarctic Survey called phase-sensitive radio-echo sounding, a process by which they can measure the thickness of the ice.It's a method that had previously been used on floating ice sheets around Antarctica.\"We weren't sure that the technique would also work on a fast-flowing glacier in Greenland,\" said Tun Jan Young, first author of the study, who installed the radar system on Store Glacier. \"Compared to Antarctica, the ice deforms really fast, and there is a lot of meltwater in summer, which complicates the work.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)The Biden administration has once again put a pause on new leases and permits for federal oil and gas drilling after a judge blocked the administration from using a metric that estimates the societal cost of carbon emissions.Earlier this month, US District Judge James Cain of the Western District of Louisiana issued an injunction preventing the Biden administration from using what's known as the \"social cost of carbon\" in decisions around oil and gas drilling on public land, or in rules governing fossil fuel emissions. The ruling has consequences for a range of Biden administration actions on climate change, but especially on the Interior Department's federal oil and gas leasing program. In an appeal filed by government attorneys on Saturday night, the Biden administration argued Cain's injunction necessitated a pause on all projects where the government was using a social-cost-of-carbon analysis in its decision-making.The appeal is the latest in a legal battle in the courts between several Republican-led states and the Biden administration over the social cost of carbon, a metric that uses economic models to put a value on each ton of carbon dioxide emitted. The idea is to quantify the economic harm caused by the climate crisis like sea level rise, more destructive hurricanes, extreme wildfire seasons and flooding.Cities tried to cut natural gas from new homes. The GOP and gas lobby preemptively quashed their effortThe metric was first implemented during the Obama administration and substantially weakened by the Trump government. Read MoreBiden revived the social cost of carbon on his first day in office, setting it at $51 per ton of CO2 emissions -- the same level as set by the Obama administration. The administration was expected to release an updated figure this February. \"The consequences of the injunction are dramatic,\" the Biden administration's filing reads. \"Pending rulemakings in separate agencies throughout the government -- none of which were actually challenged here -- will now be delayed. Other agency actions may now be abandoned due to an inability to redo related environmental analyses in time to meet mandatory deadlines.\"The filing also said that internal agency discussions on a new social cost of carbon have stopped, and that Cain's ruling has even undermined Biden's ability to discuss the estimate with other foreign leaders or White House staff.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. (CNN)Few ancient wonders still stand, but their remnants captivate us with the promise of untold stories. The first excavations at Stonehenge began in the 1600s, and researchers have tried to unlock its secrets ever since. Generations of people labored to create the iconic stone circle 4,500 years ago, which still stands in southwest England. Further into the distant past, there is evidence of wooden poles to mark the location that date back 10,000 years.Although a distinctly English site, Stonehenge bears the marks of long-distance links to other countries like Germany. But one enduring question remains: Why was it built? No written records exist to shed light on the monument's significance. However, the best way to understand something is to look at who created it.Read MoreA long time agoStonehenge was built 4,500 years ago, but the true purpose of the monument remains elusive.Stonehenge was once at the center of a rapidly changing world, bearing witness to the shift from mobile hunter-gatherer societies to the founding of farms that sprawled across the United Kingdom.A new exhibition at The British Museum in London has collected 430 illuminating objects from an 8,000-year span across Europe, during which stone tools gave way to stunning metalwork. The rare artifacts shows what life was like when the megaliths were raised, offering an enticing glimpse into their secrets.Some objects could have cosmic significance, like the Nebra sky disc, which may have functioned as an astronomical calendar.Other fascinating items include an antler headdress, a jadeite axe-head and a carved stone drum, considered to be \"the most important piece of prehistoric art to be found in Britain in the last 100 years.\" Other worldsIt has been a year since the Perseverance rover landed on Mars with its helicopter sidekick, Ingenuity. Since then, the robotic duo have made history, simultaneously setting and breaking exploration records on the red planet.Ingenuity has taken to the Martian skies 19 times, while Perseverance has collected six samples from rocks that will be returned to Earth in the 2030s. This year, the intrepid adventurers are setting their sights on an intriguing new target: the remains of an ancient river delta. Exploring this destination is the prime reason scientists wanted to visit Mars' Jezero Crater. Samples collected there could contain microfossils, which would be evidence of ancient life -- if it ever existed on Mars.Fantastic creaturesFlorida manatees are chowing down on 20,000 pounds of lettuce a week.Florida's manatees are being treated to an aquatic salad bar, and it may save their lives. A new feeding program dumps roughly 20,000 pounds (9,072 kilograms) of romaine and butter lettuce into a popular manatee lagoon each week, serving about 350 manatees a day.These marine mammals are dying at an alarming rate, largely due to starvation. There are only about 7,500 Florida manatees, and last year, more than 1,000 died.The manatees are responding well to the program so far, showing up to chomp on leafy greens that give them the nutrients and digestible carbohydrates they need.Dig thisA fossil first discovered in 2010 is actually a previously unknown species of crocodile that lived in Australia 95 million years ago. But even more rare was the surprise waiting inside of what was once the 8.2-foot-long (2.5-meter-long) reptile's stomach: a young dinosaur. The find is the first evidence of a crocodile preying on a dinosaur in Australia. The creature's last meal suggests that it killed the dinosaur or foraged it soon after the dinosaur died. The discovery is causing researchers to question the role dinosaurs played in the food chain, especially when they became the prey of other animals.Climate changedThis lichen species lives in the arid Atacama Desert of northern Chile.Rapid changes in our climate may outpace the evolution of some of Earth's most wide-ranging organisms, like lichen.Those funky-looking patches you see on trees and rocks cover 7% of the planet's surface. Algae live inside of greenhouse-like structures provided by fungus, and together they form lichen, anywhere from the Arctic tundra to the most arid desert. Lichens create oxygen, retain moisture and contribute to water cycling in ecosystems. They also serve as a food source for many species, including some mammals, like reindeer.And scientists were shocked to discover that the tiny algae within lichen may take hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of years to adapt as Earth's climate changes more quickly than ever.\nAre you trying to live greener? It's easy to say we want to go green -- to be more conscious of our impact on the planet and live in a way that doesn't add to the climate crisis. But where do you start?

        "content": "(CNN)Demonstrations in Ottawa turned violent Friday as protesters, according to authorities, assaulted officers and tried to remove their weapons.\"All means of de-escalation have been used to move forward in our goal of returning Ottawa to (its) normalcy,\" police in Canada's capital said in a tweet.Police tweeted a photograph of mounted officers forming a line and later said people fell when officers on horseback tried to disperse the crowd.\"Anyone who fell, got up and walked away. We're unaware of any injuries,\" police said on Twitter.One person was arrested when a bicycle was thrown in the direction of a horse farther down the line, police said. Read MoreCity, provincial and federal law enforcement officers began an unprecedented operation Friday morning to remove protesters and their trucks and cars that have been blockading Ottawa's streets for weeks. By Friday night, more than 100 people had been arrested and 21 vehicles were towed.\"You must leave. You must cease further unlawful activity and immediately remove your vehicle and/or property from all unlawful protest sites,\" police tweeted on three occasions Friday night. \"Anyone within the unlawful protest site may be arrested.\"At an afternoon news conference, interim Ottawa Police Chief Steve Bell said authorities would work all day and all night to move protesters out.\"We're in control of the situation on the ground and continue to push forward to clear our streets,\" Bell said. Officers on horseback try disperse protesters in Ottawa on Friday.Several trucks and cars have voluntarily left the protest but dozens continue to block streets in and around Parliament. Fact check: Strong majority of Canadians oppose convoy protests, poll after poll findsOttawa police earlier tweeted protesters placed children between police operations and the protest site. \"The children will be brought to a place of safety,\" the tweet said. CNN has observed those children on the protest site in the last several days. Bell said police have not needed to interact with The Children's Aid Society of Ottawa in connection with children in the crowd. The society, according to its website, is a non-profit community organization funded by Ontario's government and is legally mandated to protect children and youth from abuse and neglect.\"Even through all the planning, it still shocks and surprises me that we are seeing children put in harm's way, in the middle of a demonstration where a police operation is unfolding,\" Bell said. \"We will continue to look after their safety and security but we implore all the parents who have kids in there, get the kids out of there.\"Local media showed live pictures of several arrests that occurred earlier Friday without incident. Police searches and arrests took place at a location less than a half-mile from the main protest site at Parliament Hill.

He was released on conditions and a bond, she added. Lich is scheduled to appear in court Saturday morning for her arraignment.Video posted on social media shows Lich interacting with a police officer, then being handcuffed and led away to a police cruiser. Lich has encouraged protesters to convene in Ottawa, and recently called for supporters to continue their protest despite it being declared unlawful. She created a GoFundMe campaign for the \"Freedom Convoy\" which raised millions of dollars before it was suspended by the platform.The convoy first arrived in Ottawa on January 29 to express their disapproval of a vaccine mandate to enter the country or face testing requirements. Over the course of more than two weeks, the protest has since spiraled into a wider grievance against all Covid-19 measures, including mask-wearing and vaccinations.Ottawa police began erecting barriers and fencing throughout the downtown core Thursday in an effort to clear the area of demonstrators, who have used trucks to block city roads and remained defiant amid calls by police to disperse.Overnight, the three police forces hardened the perimeter in the downtown core, which includes checkpoints at on-ramps from highways and side streets. Ottawa police chief is leaving his post, city officials say amid ongoing protestsThe secured area would ensure that those seeking entry for an \"unlawful reason such as joining a protest cannot enter the downtown core,\" according to Bell.With nearly 100 checkpoints, the perimeter encompasses most of Ottawa's downtown area and is far larger than the protest footprint to date.Those who live, work or have a lawful reason to be in the area would be allowed access, authorities said. Trudeau defends call for emergency powersAmid opposition in Parliament, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau defended his decision to invoke emergency powers to put an end to the demonstrations during an address Thursday to legislators.  Officials have said a primary aim of invoking the Emergencies Act is to stifle funding to the demonstrators in Ottawa. Law enforcement officers confront protesters during a demonstration in Ottawa on Friday.\"These illegal blockades are being heavily supported by individuals in the United States and from elsewhere around the world,\" Trudeau said. \"We see that roughly half of the funding that is flowing to the barricaders here is coming from the United States. The goal of all measures, including financial measures in the Emergencies Act, is to deal with the current threat only, and to get the situation fully under control.\"Traveling to Canada during Covid-19: What you need to know before you goThe act, passed in 1988 and never before invoked, can temporarily suspend citizens' rights to free movement or assembly. It can also provide for the use of the military, but Trudeau has said this would not be necessary.\"We did it to protect families and small businesses. To protect jobs and the economy. We did it because the situation could not be dealt with under any other law in Canada,\" Trudeau said. \"For the good of all Canadians, the illegal blockades and occupations have to stop, and the borders have to remain open.\" Border crossing blockades in Alberta and Ontario came to an end this week, with arrests being made as police cleared the areas. Four individuals have been charged with conspiracy to commit murder at the blockade at Coutts, Alberta, and multiple weapons and rounds of ammunition were seized.Another blockade in Manitoba ended without incident, authorities said. The port of entry connecting Surrey, British Columbia to Blaine, Washington, has also been reopened.

It strengthens and supports law enforcement agencies, so they have more tools to restore order and protect critical infrastructure.\" CNN's Raja Razek, Chris Boyette, Amir Vera and Jenn Selva contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)As surging global temperatures alter the landscape of the Arctic, scientists are observing what's shaping up to be a new record at the other end of the globe. Preliminary data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center suggests Antarctica will likely set a record this year for the lowest sea ice extent -- the area of ocean covered by sea ice. On Wednesday, sea ice around the continent dropped lower than the previous record minimum set in March 2017. \"What's going on in the Antarctic is an extreme event,\" Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder and lead scientist at NSIDC, told CNN. \"But we've been through this a bit.\"The ice shelf holding back the 'Doomsday glacier' could shatter within the next five years, scientists warnWhat he means by \"this\" is a roller coaster of sea ice extent over the past couple of decades, swinging wildly from record highs to record lows. Unlike the Arctic, where scientists say climate change is accelerating its impacts, Antarctica's sea ice extent is highly variable.\"There's a link between what's going on in Antarctica and the general warming trend around the rest of the world, but it's different from what we see in mountain glaciers and what we see in the Arctic,\" he added.Read MoreSatellite data that stretches back to 1978 shows that the region was still producing record-high sea ice extent as recently as 2014 and 2015. Then it suddenly plunged in 2016 and has stayed lower-than-average since.\"That kind of drop is pretty much unprecedented in the record,\" Marilyn Raphael, geography professor and director at UCLA's Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, told CNN. \"Antarctic sea ice does vary from year to year, but that was a bigger variation than what normally happens.\"\n\nScientists say the recent shift doesn't yet necessarily signify a change in the long-term trend. But Raphael said the sea ice is retreating earlier now, which can be concerning. \"There are two parts of me that answer this -- the scientist part says, 'wait a little bit longer and see.' That's my cautious part,\" Raphael said. \"Then the other part of me says, this is unusual variation in the ice. The degree is unusual, and it could be that that's a sign that climate is changing, and that's the speculation part.\"The rate of sea ice loss in the Arctic and the Antarctic differs in part due to their location and proximity to other continents. In the Arctic, surrounded by land, sea ice forms and extends throughout Europe, Asia, North America and Greenland. Meanwhile, the Antarctic is a large continent surrounded by a vast ocean where sea ice can stretch across the Southern Ocean.Scambos said because continents are warming rapidly, snow cover is melting earlier than usual and exposing the dark surface of the ground, which absorbs more heat, causing the Arctic to melt faster. In contrast, the Antarctic stays covered in ice, which reflects sunlight and keeps the surrounding air cooler.A Turkish science expedition vessel creeps through Grandidier Channel and Penola Strait in Antarctica on February 7, moving slowly to avoid icebergs.Despite the complex climate signals in Antarctica's record low sea ice, scientists point out that the increasing warming trend in the polar regions amplifies the consequences of the crisis globally. \"Polar regions really have a way of making these small changes a bigger deal,\" Scambos said, \"either through sea-level rise, which is the main cause for concern from Antarctica, or through warmer climate generally, because the Arctic is sort of the air conditioner for the places where most of us live in the Northern Hemisphere.\"US sea levels will rise rapidly in the next 30 years, new report showsHe adds it would take more than a decade of a persistent downward trend in order to link the dwindling sea ice in the Antarctic to climate change, even though temperature conditions in many parts of Antarctica are already exhibiting a warming trend.But on the continent itself, some alarming effects of climate change have started to take shape: Just last year, researchers, including Scambos, observed that the critical ice shelf holding back the Thwaites glacier in western Antarctica could shatter within the next three to five years, which could result in devastating sea-level rise.From their camp in the middle of the Antarctic to their stations on the coast, researchers flew over the gargantuan Thwaites glacier, also known as the \"Doomsday Glacier,\" for two hours. Scambos said they could see \"massive cracks in this ice shelf, places where the ice is tearing apart.\" He said it's an example of how the climate change impact in one very specific location could have consequences for the entire planet.\"The trends have rearranged a little bit because fundamentally over the last four decades, Antarctica has just been pushed around by the changes in ocean temperature and wind,\" said Scambos. \"The thing about Antarctica and sea ice is it is very unconstrained, sort of at the mercy of wind patterns, storms, snowfall, and ocean temperatures -- all these things have an impact.\"He said that the only rational way to tackle climate change is to rapidly adapt to the impacts and slash the planet-warming emissions that are the root cause of the crisis and have thrown our planet's most pristine places, such as the Antarctic, into a downward spiral.Recalling his time in West Antarctica, Scambos said he looked in the horizon with the cracking ice shelf holding back the Doomsday glacier in the background, and saw sobering signs of what's likely to happen in the future. He realized how much more climate research needs to be done.\"It raises your level of concern quite a bit,\" he said. \"I won't say it's scary because you're not scared in the moment. You're in awe of what's going on here.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)President Joe Biden pledged during his first days in office that 40% of federal funds for climate and clean energy initiatives would be prioritized for underserved communities -- a key pillar of his environmental justice agenda. On Friday, the administration announced that around 29% of the US population is eligible for those prioritized funds. The White House Council on Environmental Quality's methodology accounts for income, health and climate risks, and a community's proximity to polluting industries or wastewater.  But it notably leaves out race as a factor to determine whether a community is eligible for the initiative, prompting some pushback from environmental justice advocates who say the point of Justice40 is to address environmental racism. What a hurricane means when you live in Louisiana's 'Cancer Alley'A CEQ official said that while the White House team fully acknowledges \"the role of racism and race in determining where environmental burdens are and have been in this country,\" it also wants the tool to pass legal muster.  \"We have a desire to make sure this tool is legally enduring,\" the CEQ official told reporters. \"I think both folks within the government and externally have made clear that we cannot be using race as an indicator to guide resource decisions to have that highest threshold for legal defensibility.\" Read MoreResearch has shown that communities of color often face disproportionate exposure to air pollution that leads to respiratory illnefss. The American Lung Association's 2021 \"State of the Air\" report showed that people of color are 61% more likely than White people to live in a county with a failing grade for at least one pollutant.  Studies have also found that communities of color are more likely to be on the front lines of the climate crisis. \"Too many American communities are still living with water that isn't safe to drink, housing that isn't built to withstand climate change-fueled storms, and too few opportunities to benefit from the nation's bright and clean future,\" CEQ Chair Brenda Mallory said. \"The Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool will help Federal agencies ensure that the benefits of the nation's climate, clean energy, and environmental programs are finally reaching the communities that have been left out and left behind for far too long.\"New York City residents sort through damaged and destroyed items after a night of deadly flooding from the remnants of Hurricane Ida in September 2021.New York state passed a law in 2019 with a similar goal, to invest 35% to 40% of its climate and clean energy funds into \"disadvantaged communities.\" New York's methodology diverges from the White House approach by including race as a qualifying category.  The White House is launching a website with a searchable map to identify the most environmentally disadvantaged communities around the country. A census tract on the map will be considered a disadvantaged community by CEQ if it exceeds at least one of eight criteria in both the climate and environmental risk category and the socioeconomic risk category. For some environmentalists, 'I can't breathe' is about more than police brutalityCEQ officials said federal agencies will be the primary users of the tool, identifying which communities can qualify for federal climate and clean energy funding. Friday's launch is a beta version of the website, and CEQ will be taking public comment on the tool for 60 days. \"We want to build the tool in a way that reflects the realities that racism and race are big determining factors in where pollution is concentrated in this country,\" the official said.  The CEQ official was not aware of any potential legal challenges to the tool. The Biden administration hopes that states and local communities will take advantage of the tool to see who is eligible for federal funding, the official said. \"I think what we're hoping is that people will explore the tool and give us feedback on it and help build this tool in a way that reflects the experiences and priorities in their own states,\" the official said.",

        "content": "(CNN)Meteorologists in the UK have issued a rare danger-to-life alert as Storm Eunice is forecast to batter parts of the country Friday, potentially creating a \"sting jet\" that could bring havoc to streets.On Thursday, the UK's weather service, the Met Office, issued the rare red alert -- the highest weather warning category in the UK -- warning that Eunice is forecast to bring \"significant and damaging\" gusts of up to 90 mph and threaten life.It could also bring high waves and coastal flooding in the west, southwest and south coast of England, the Met Office said.The warnings come as thousands of people went without power in the UK's north after Storm Dudley brought down trees and cut households from the grid. Dudley hit England's north, Scotland's south and Northern Ireland on Wednesday, disrupting railways, roads and businesses with high winds and local flooding.Read MorePlane battling winds at Heathrow nearly topples overPeter Inness, a meteorologist at England's University of Reading, said that the back-to-back storms had formed as a result of a strong 200 mph jet steam blowing across the Atlantic Ocean. It is not unusual to see \"two or more damaging storms\" form in quick succession, he said in a statement. But what makes Eunice potentially \"rare\" and more potent is that it could evolve into a \"sting jet\" -- a \"narrow, focused region of extremely strong winds\" amid a \"larger area of strong winds.\"The Met Office is urging people to only travel if \"necessary\" and warned drivers that road closures could be in place on Friday. People across the UK should also secure outdoor furniture and bins, and should avoid parking near trees.Severe storms to become more frequent Met Office meteorologist Jonathan Vautrey told CNN he expected Friday's storm to have \"high impacts,\" with flying debris and damage to homes likely. \"It's developing out in the Atlantic at present, [and] it's heading directly for the UK so to speak,\" he said. \"It will clear out of the UK over the course of Friday and travel towards Denmark and the Scandinavian countries.\"Computer weather modelling shows extreme wind gusts will impact the UK Friday.Vautrey said that, while it was \"too early\" to say whether storms Dudley and Eunice were \"aided by climate change,\" but that the frequency of severe weather event generally was increasing.High-elevation forests in the Rockies are burning more now than in the past 2,000 years\"Global warming has led to changes in our weather patterns, and that is something we will increasingly have to take note of and be ready to deal with in the future,\" he said. Hannah Cloke, a professor of hydrology at the University of Reading, warned people not to take the red alert \"lightly.\"\"Red means you need to act now because there is an imminent danger to life,\" she said in a statement.\"Winds of 70 mph will uproot trees, which can block roads and crush cars or buildings. They can pick up roof tiles and hurl them around.  If you're hit by one of those you will be seriously hurt or killed.  Wind that strong will sweep people and vehicles off streets, and topple electricity lines.\"",

He said Wednesday that he had spoken to ministers and asked for \"immediate assistance\" to be sent to the victims.Since the 1960s, southern Brazil has experienced an increase in both the number of extreme rain events and the mean amount of rainfall, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This is partly explained by natural variability in weather patterns, but also because of climate change, as well as aerosols and the depletion of ozone in the atmosphere. Average global temperatures are now at least 1.1 degrees Celsius higher than they were before industrialization. Warming of 2C would mean even more intense and frequent of extreme rain events and flooding in southern Brazil, according to the IPCC.Scientists say the world needs to make deep, sustained cuts to greenhouse gases, primarily by transitioning away from fossil fuels, to contain global warming to 1.5C.Brazil has seen a number of natural disasters in recent months.At the beginning of February at least 24 people died after heavy rain battered S\u00e3o Paulo, home to Brazil's financial center, triggering floods and landslides across the southeastern Brazilian state.More than 1,546 families were displaced, according to a statement released by the State Civil Defense, which also said that at least eight children died in the disaster.And at the end of December it was announced that the death toll from floods and heavy rain, which had blighted the Brazilian state of Bahia since November, had risen to 20.Flooding also caused two dams to burst and the displacement of an estimated 62,800 people, state officials say.",

        "content": "(CNN)Florida's manatees -- which are dying at an alarming rate, largely from starvation -- are being treated to tons of lettuce a week as part of a new feeding program that state wildlife officials say is showing signs of success.An average of 350 manatees a day are now coming to eat the greens being distributed at a temporary field response station in Cape Canaveral, along Florida's east coast, officials from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) said Wednesday.The manatees gather at the temporary feeding ground.The program was launched earlier this year as officials work to address the unusual manatee mortality event along the state's Atlantic coast. Last year, more than 1,000 manatees in the state died, according to the commission -- the highest recorded number of manatee deaths in decades.State wildlife officials, along with the US Fish and Wildlife Service and in coordination with Florida Power & Light, set up the temporary feeding ground at the utility's Cape Canaveral Clean Energy Center in Brevard County. \"The energy center is located in the northern Indian River Lagoon and is a critical stop-off point where manatees congregate as they migrate south during the winter,\" Florida Power & Light wrote in a December news release.Read MoreOn Wednesday, during a weekly video conference, officials said they have increased the amount of food they are distributing to roughly 20,000 pounds of vegetation a week, primarily romaine and butter leaf lettuce.Both are known forages used in rehabilitation centers, according to Ron Mezich of the FWC. The produce has nutrients and digestible carbohydrates that the animals need, he added.\"At this point in time, we have been successful. Manatees are eating the romaine,\" said Mezich. \"We are exposing large amount of animals to this food source and we are making a difference.\"Produce is distributed to the manatees, also called sea cows.The number of animals per day has ranged from 25 to as many as 800, according to Mezich, and depends on the cold weather.While officials have seen some success, commission spokesperson Tom Reinert said they have seen an uptick on mortalities, likely a combination of the stress the animals are already under due to the lack of food resources and the cold temperatures. This year there have been 261 manatee deaths in the state, according to FWC data updated February 11. Many of those deaths are pending necropsy for an official cause of death.There are currently more than 7,500 Florida manatees, according to FWC. Reinert said it will take years before any kind of impact to the manatee population as a whole will be known from this unusual mortality event. The feeding program is anticipated to continue through March, according to Mezich. The program has been funded greatly by donations from the public to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Foundation, which has paid for the produce shipments, according to Reinert.

        "content": "(CNN)President Joe Biden on Thursday announced $1 billion in funding from his administration's signature bipartisan infrastructure law would go toward cleanup and restoration of the Great Lakes. \"It's going to allow the most significant restoration of the Great Lakes in the history of the Great Lakes,\" Biden said in remarks in Lorain, Ohio. The bulk of funding is targeted to restore what the Environmental Protection Agency has identified as severely degraded \"Areas of Concern.\" The administration projects that funding from the infrastructure law -- combined with funds from annual Great Lakes Restoration Initiative appropriations and other sources -- should allow restoration of at least 22 areas of concern across Wisconsin, New York, Ohio, Minnesota, Michigan, Indiana and Illinois by 2030, with infrastructure funding also benefiting three additional sites over the same period.Exclusive: Experts say the term 'drought' may be insufficient to capture what is happening in the WestThe President said some of the sites that will be addressed have been \"dangerously polluted for decades.\"Biden noted the lakes provide drinking water and support more than one million jobs in manufacturing, tourism, transportation, warehousing, farming and fishing. A 2020 EPA analysis of the Great Lakes found the region supports more than 1.3 million jobs and generates $82 billion in wages annually.Read MoreThe President quoted Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison, who was born in Lorain, in his speech. The book the President quoted, \"Beloved,\" has been the target of some conservatives trying to ban the book from public school curriculums in Virginia. Biden noted Friday would have been Morrison's birthday -- she died in 2019 -- and said she is one of first lady Jill Biden's favorite authors. \"She once wrote, 'We got more yesterdays than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow.' Places like Lorain have a lot of proud yesterdays. Now, you're going to have some brighter tomorrows,\" the President said. The President made the announcement from the Black River in Lorain, Ohio, a tributary of Lake Erie and one of the 22 areas listed in Thursday's funding disbursement.\"The Great Lakes are a vital economic engine and an irreplaceable environmental wonder, supplying drinking water for more than 40 million people, supporting nearly 1.5 million jobs, and sustaining life for thousands of species,\" EPA Administrator Michael Regan wrote in a statement shared with CNN on Wednesday. \"Through the investments from President Biden's bipartisan infrastructure deal, we will make unprecedented progress in our efforts to restore and protect the waters and the communities of the Great Lakes basin.\"Per the EPA, the river earned the nickname \"river of fish tumors,\" \"due to its long history of industrial, agricultural, and urban uses, which led to poor water quality, loss of biodiversity, habitat degradation and sedimentation.\"\"This $1 billion investment will accelerate the cleanup across sites across the Great Lakes Basin, from Duluth, Minnesota, to Buffalo, New York, and everywhere in between, including several major areas of concern in Ohio, where the President will be traveling tomorrow,\" a senior administration official told reporters Wednesday. \"This accelerated cleanup and restoration effort will deliver environmental health and recreational benefits for communities throughout the region. It will also help revitalize the economy in these communities, like it's doing, and Loraine's Black River waterfront.\"White House to unveil multi-pronged approach to reduce emissions in the manufacturing sectorCleaning up degraded waterways is a costly and labor-intensive endeavor, with extensive sediment remediation required. One official estimated that cleanup projects for areas of concern near Milwaukee and Detroit could cost up to $100 million each. Per the administration, the funding will be disbursed in accordance with the White House's Justice40 Initiative, which tasks agencies with ensuring that at least 40% of federal award dollars are directed to those it designates \"disadvantaged communities,\" including cities like Sheboygan, Wisconsin, Buffalo, New York, Lorain and Duluth, Minnesota.\"With this investment, President Biden is delivering major environmental, public health, and economic wins for the Great Lakes region,\" former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, who's tasked with implementing the infrastructure law, wrote in a statement shared with CNN on Wednesday.\"Building a better America requires us to confront legacy pollution and clean up the environment -- ensuring our kids drink clean water and creating good-paying jobs in the process. We know that cleaning up these waterways and improving the health of the Great Lakes will also create great economic opportunities for communities across the eight-state region and beyond.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)In 2019, the city council in Berkeley, California, held a stunning vote: it would ban natural gas hookups in all new building construction to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the city's impact on the climate crisis.  No gas furnaces in new homes, the council said. No gas stoves or ovens.Other progressive cities followed suit with similar bans. San Francisco passed its own ban in 2020. New York City became the largest US city to pass a version in 2021, with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul vowing to pass a statewide law that would ban natural gas by 2027.But other municipalities looking to take similar action are running into a brick wall. Twenty states with GOP-controlled legislatures have passed so-called \"preemption laws\" that prohibit cities from banning natural gas.It's bad news for municipal climate action: Taking natural gas out of the equation and switching to electric appliances is one of the most effective ways cities can tackle the climate crisis and lower their emissions, multiple experts told CNN.\n\nRead More\"Natural gas bans are kind of low-hanging fruit,\" said Georgetown Law professor Sheila Foster, an environmental law expert. Foster said cities can make a significant impact by moving away from natural gas and toward electricity, especially considering what little federal action there's been on climate, and the mixed record of states.The climate stakes are high. Residential and commercial emissions made up 13% of total US emissions in 2019, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. About 80% of those emissions came from the combustion of natural gas, the fuel that heats homes or powers a restaurant's cooking stoves, and emits planet-warming gases like methane and carbon dioxide in the process.Gas stoves are a threat to health and have larger climate impact than previously known, study shows But clean alternatives exist: Electric heat pumps can heat homes more sustainably than gas furnaces; induction ranges can replace gas stoves. And experts stress that to fully transition to renewable energy sources like solar and wind, homes and businesses need to operate on electricity -- not gas. President Joe Biden's Build Back Better bill, which fizzled in the Senate after objections from Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, contained billions in tax incentives to help consumers switch to cleaner ways of heating their homes. But people who own and rent homes in big, multi-unit buildings depend on developers and city planners to make the switch.  Advocates worry these preemptive bills could stall impactful climate action at a critical time. \"We're afraid that's going to have a chilling effect on cities that want to take action,\" said Alejandra Mejia Cunningham, a building decarbonization advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \"Many cities and towns have small staffs, they don't want to be taken to court, being seen as going outside state law.\" A 'new trend'In November, a GOP bill to block natural gas bans in new buildings was passed in North Carolina but ultimately failed to make it into law when Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed it. Two more similar bills are being considered in Pennsylvania and Michigan this year.  \"To me that's what's interesting about this new trend, it seems like states are trying to eliminate the possibility before cities try to catch onto this,\" Sarah Fox, an associate law professor at Northern Illinois University School of Law, told CNN. \"The natural gas industry realized this was in the water a while ago and has been very aggressive in getting this passed.\" The American Gas Association, the natural gas industry's powerful trade group, told CNN it lobbies at the federal level but isn't directly lobbying in any state. But many of the association's members, including gas utilities, have gotten involved at the state level, according to an analysis by independent climate think tank InfluenceMap for CNN.  InfluenceMap \"found high levels of engagement on preemption bills within the power sector, including its key trade associations.\" The American Gas Association and its members \"appears to have played an early role encouraging these bills,\" according to the analysis. There's also evidence that suggests the AGA is running the playbook for its members to lobby state lawmakers for the preemptive laws. The world is addicted to natural gas. Fossil fuel companies are lobbying hard to keep it that wayIn audio of a private AGA call obtained by watchdog group Energy and Policy Institute and shared with CNN, the AGA's Vice President of Advocacy and Outreach Sue Forrester discussed the group's strategy modeling \"preemptive legislation\" in certain states. \"We launched in partnership with Southwest [Gas]. Well, they launched it, but we were helping on the back end: Energy choice language in Arizona that was passed and signed by the governor at the beginning of the year,\" Forrester said in the recording. When asked about Forrester's comments, an American Gas Association spokesperson reiterated the trade association doesn't get involved in state-level legislation. \"Sue's comments make it sound that way, and that's unfortunate, but the American Gas Association is not set up with lobbyists on the ground in the states,\" the spokesperson said, adding the \"we\" Forrester was referring to is \"we as the industry and all who have an interest in gas.\" CEO of the American Gas Association Karen Harbert told CNN in a statement that \"AGA is educating policymakers at every level about the supportive policy frameworks necessary for natural gas and our infrastructure to help achieve our nation's ambitious environmental goals.\" While the AGA and other industry groups are messaging that they are advocating for more fuel choices for consumers, climate advocates say the preemption laws are having the opposite effect.  \"I'd say the industry has put decades of effort and resources into fine tuning their messaging to the American public -- and they do it well,\" NRDC's Mejia Cunningham told CNN. Some cities in the US want to ban natural gas hookups in new homes and buildings, to reduce their fossil fuel emissions and meet their climate targets. Natural gas is primarly made of methane, an extremely potent planet-warming gas.Most cities and towns in the US that are pursuing natural gas reforms are not shooting for stringent bans like what Berkeley passed -- many are trying to find a middle ground that incorporate and encourage electrification and heat pumps as an alternative to gas.  Broadly written state laws can discourage that transition, Mejia Cunningham said. \"We don't expect Berkeley to be the right model for most of America,\" she said. \"That doesn't mean we should completely slash out a whole bucket of policies that could work for communities across America.\" An attempt to electrify gets quashed In 2019, officials in Flagstaff, Arizona, were working on their city's plan to get to net-zero emissions by 2030. Building emissions were an obvious target; the built environment is the largest contributor to Flagstaff's greenhouse gas emissions, Nicole Antonopoulos, Flagstaff's sustainability director, told CNN. Flagstaff's plan didn't include an explicit ban on natural gas; instead, it said the city would promote \"aggressive building electrification,\" thereby decreasing reliance on fossil fuels.  That was still enough to get the attention of members of the Republican-controlled Arizona state legislature, which in 2020 passed a bill preventing cities and towns from passing their own natural gas bans. The West's megadrought is worst in 1,200 years. Los Angeles is taking wastewater recycling to the extreme\"It was a huge setback, in a nutshell,\" Antonopoulos told CNN. \"The state preemption threw a huge kink in our efforts towards carbon neutrality. This isn't the first time the state has preempted things that have made us go back to the proverbial drawing table and figure out how we get creative and innovative in a space where we don't have funding.\" Arizona's 2020 law -- the first natural gas preemption law of its kind -- was a harbinger of what was to come. Since then, 19 other states have adopted them. These laws have largely been concentrated in red states in the Rust Belt and Southwest, a cluster of southwestern states including Utah and Wyoming, and New Hampshire. And currently, there's not much favoring cities' ability to sue states. The 1907 US Supreme Court case Hunter v. Pittsburgh favored states' authority to craft laws for their cities, and gave cities little legal recourse to sue. \"It's not a very coherent line of case law, but that's the official stance,\" said Fox, who added she'd be very surprised if the current conservative Supreme Court majority allowed a challenge to the current law from progressive cities. \"There's a lot of legal uncertainty,\" Foster said, adding that there's not much current litigation to speak of around natural gas bans and preemption laws. In Flagstaff, Antonopoulos said her office is trying to find ways around Arizona's law. It's meant a lot of active outreach to local developers building in Flagstaff, encouraging them to build all-electric housing developments. It's also reaching out to residents whose gas appliances are at the end of their lifecycles to consider buying electric. \"Our challenge here is we have a 2030 deadline\" to get to net-zero, Antonopoulos told CNN. \"The urgency is so great so sometimes we don't have that luxury in time.\" CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct that Mejia Cunningham was speaking on behalf of the Natural Resources Defense Council.CNN's Rene Marsh contributed to this report.",

Environmental Protection Agency spokesperson Nick Conger confirmed the EPA's final decision on the waiver is expected soon.\"We are working to finalize a decision on the California waiver and we expect to issue a decision in the near future,\" Conger told CNN.

President Joe Biden's administration announced last year that it would start the process of putting the waiver back in place.Read MoreCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, applauded the move.\"We welcome the Biden Administration's expected move to recognize our authority to continue setting the pace with bold policies, investments and partnerships to clean the air and accelerate the global zero-emission vehicle transition,\" Newsom said in a statement. \"The restoration of our state's decades-long Clean Air Act waiver will be a major victory for the environment, our economy and the health of Americans across the country in states that have chosen to adopt our pioneering standards.\"Outside environmental groups also said finalizing the waiver was an important step to restore state authority on emissions.\"States play an essential role in driving us toward a zero emissions transportation future,\" said Earthjustice President Abigail Dillen in a statement. \"By restoring California's authority to set stronger clean car standards, the Biden administration is taking a critical step to protect public health and combat the climate crisis.\"California Air Resources Board member Daniel Sperling told CNN that the state won't use its waiver to implement stronger standards for cars and light trucks and will instead use the Biden EPA's recently adopted standards. The new federal fuel emissions, setting standards for those vehicles to 40 miles per gallon by the 2026 model year, were finalized in December.  DOE will build nation's first large-scale facility to turn fossil fuel waste into rare materials for techWhere the state will likely go farther than the federal government is in standards for heavy-duty trucks, Sperling said.  \"California has decided it will go along with the federal greenhouse gas emissions standards for light-duty vehicles,\" Sperling told CNN. \"Where it's diverging is these heavy-duty and light-duty zero-emission rules for cars and trucks.\" In 2020, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed an executive order mandating that all vehicles sold in the state must be zero-emissions by 2035. \"This is the most impactful step our state can take to fight climate change,\" Newsom said in a news release at the time. \"Californians shouldn't have to worry if our cars are giving our kids asthma. Our cars shouldn't make wildfires worse \u2014 and create more days filled with smoky air. Cars shouldn't melt glaciers or raise sea levels threatening our cherished beaches and coastlines.\"Sperling said Newsom's order includes new heavy-duty vehicles as well.\"The commitment is to zero-emission vehicles, all on-road vehicles,\" Sperling told CNN.

        "content": "(CNN)As the American West continues into its 22nd year of a parching megadrought, officials at the federal government's top water resource management agency are trying to plan for an uncertain and unprecedented time for the nation's largest reservoirs.  \"When [the system] was built 100 years ago, you could look outside your window if you're in Colorado and see snow, and know that that's your reservoir for the spring,\" Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Camille Touton told CNN in an exclusive interview. \"It's not like that anymore. What you're seeing there is just a completely different way in which the system is managed.\" Winter weather conditions in the West have been, in a word, inconsistent.  The West's megadrought is worst in 1,200 years. Los Angeles is taking wastewater recycling to the extremeAfter California's Sierra Nevada mountains were blanketed by 17 feet of snow in late December, the state then experienced one of its driest Januarys on record. Denver went an unusually long stretch with no snow in the early winter before the state saw storms in January.This lack of consistency and predictability with winter snowpack means Reclamation is \"operating in a completely different regime, as we've never done before,\" Touton told CNN. Read More\"What we're seeing in 2022 is good snow, generally, in some places -- but at the same time, not consistent,\" Touton told CNN. \"You're seeing record events, followed by record dry months. Now add to that low reservoir level, because we didn't get a lot of inflow into our reservoirs last year.\" The bigger picture is stark. The West's megadrought is the region's worst in at least 1,200 years, according to a study published Monday, and researchers said the human-caused climate crisis has made the megadrought 72% worse.Western water experts echoed the concern that the term \"drought\" may be insufficient to capture the region's current hydrology. \"Aridification\" might be more accurate, said Eric Kuhn, a retired former manager of the Colorado River Water Conservation District.  \"Are these temporary conditions? We don't know; the science is suggesting they're not,\" Kuhn said. \"It puts Reclamation in a tough situation, because they're learning how to deal with a changing climate. Operating these systems under deep uncertainty is not what they were designed for.\" Competing for water The Bureau of Reclamation, situated in the Department of Interior, has a big role to play in how the West manages its declining water resources.  Established in the early 1900s, Reclamation built some of the West's largest reservoirs and dams. It works with states, Native American tribes, farmers and other stakeholders to manage water, generate electricity from hydroelectric dams and prepare for drought. Touton is overseeing the bureau at a time when competition over the remaining water resources is intensifying. Last summer, the federal government declared a water shortage on the Colorado River for the first time as Lake Mead's and Lake Powell's levels hit new lows. An aerial image shows Lake Mead on the Colorado River during low water levels in July.But a megadrought of this proportion had already been planned for on the Colorado River -- a complex, negotiated priority system that favors some water shareholders ahead of others based on need and historical dependence.\"We've never been in these conditions before,\" Touton said. \"But with the partnerships that we've had in the basin for decades, there was always a concern that it could get there. And it was planned for and, unfortunately, that's what we're seeing now.\" 17 feet of snow sparked hope for quelling California's drought. Then precipitation 'flatlined' in JanuaryThe bureau is due to receive $1.66 billion per year for the next five years from the bipartisan infrastructure law, effectively doubling its yearly budget. Most immediately, that means it can spend $420 million on rural water projects, $245 million for water recycling projects, $100 million each for dam repair and aging infrastructure fixes, and $50 million on drought contingency planning for the region. Touton said that as Reclamation repairs some aging reservoirs and water facilities, it will also look at new water sources -- including capturing stormwater when it rains and treating it to use later.  John Fleck, a Western water expert and professor at University of New Mexico, said that for Reclamation, the challenge of repairing aging water infrastructure pales in comparison with drought contingency planning with states, tribes and farmers. The Colorado River basin \"has a fundamental problem with overallocation of the water,\" Fleck told CNN. \"These rules that were written down on pieces of paper over 100 years ago promised more water to users in states than the river can actually provide.\" 'A moment of opportunity' Even in years with decent snowpack, the climate-fueled megadrought has meant the parched ground soaks up what moisture there is faster. That means intense competition for lower levels of water used for drinking, agriculture and electricity generation. As CNN has reported, the first group of people impacted by Colorado River water cuts will be farmers in Arizona -- but municipalities in the state could also see reductions depending on far the river levels fall.Cows graze on dry grass in California's drought-stricken Central Valley in July.\"The vast majority of this water is used for irrigated agriculture across the basin; there's just no way around the footprint of irrigated agriculture shrinking,\" Fleck told CNN.  Kuhn said that in-home water use ultimately doesn't account for much of the overall usage, as many cities re-treat and recycle water from appliances. Los Angeles, for example, is working on a plan to treat and recycle all of its wastewater. US sea levels will rise rapidly in the next 30 years, new report showsThe bigger problem is how to sustain agriculture and lawns. \"The future of the river is going to be about grass, it's not going to be about indoor plumbing,\" said Kuhn. \"The action is outdoors. It's crops and grasses.\" Last summer, Nevada banned nonfunctional grass that uses up too much water, and some cities are looking at planting native plants and grasses that don't need constant watering. Fleck said that even though the drought is anxiety-inducing, it also creates opportunities for the federal government, states and stakeholders to have a realistic conversation about how to save water. \"When the reservoirs are full, people blow it off,\" Fleck said. \"When they are draining, that's when these opportunities arise. This creates a moment of opportunity; there are hard decisions to be made.\"",

(CNN)As global temperatures steadily rise, our planet may be changing too quickly for some of nature's most wide-ranging organisms to adapt. Thousands of species of tiny plantlike organisms may evolve too slowly to keep up with Earth's changes as the climate crisis continues, according to new research. These tiny organisms are algae, something you likely picture floating as a green film on top of a pond or lake. But when algae team up with fungus, they form colonies of lichen -- those light-colored, curly patches growing on rocks and trees in your backyard. And with lichen as their vehicle, algae have the versatility to inhabit a vast range of ecosystems around the globe, living anywhere from the Arctic tundra to the most arid desert. Lichen is the dominant vegetation, covering 7% of the planet's surface.Lichen housing Trebouxia algae can be seen growing on rocks in the Czech Republic.Lichen grow on the order of millimeters per year and can be thousands of years old. Even if the middle of the lichen begins to break down and decompose, the outer edge will keep spreading out like a ring.Read MoreBut these slow-growing lichens also move at a snail's pace when it comes to evolutionary change: They don't adapt quickly enough to match the pace with which our planet is shifting, especially as it heats up.Algae enjoys a symbiotic relationship with a fungus, living inside this lichen on a rock in the Atacama Desert.Tracking evolutionary changeResearchers studied Trebouxia, single-celled algae that live inside lichen. There are more than 7,000 kinds of these lichen with algal partners, making them common across the globe. The study published Tuesday in the journal Frontiers in Microbiology.In order to understand how lichen may adapt, the researchers looked at the genetic relationships of different algae species for comparison, as well as their varied environments. By creating family trees of algae, researchers could track its evolutionary changes. The scientists realized how long it takes for algae to get used to an environment and its temperatures, precipitation amount and seasonal changes. The algae within lichen can take hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of years to adapt to their preferred climates, according to the new study.\"I was shocked,\" said lead study author Matthew Nelsen, a research scientist at Chicago's Field Museum. \"I should have known better from the other papers I've read, but I was disturbed to see it. It's so close to home, on a group of organisms near and dear to my heart.\"A symbiotic relationshipWhen it comes to lichen, the algae supply food in the form of sugars while the fungus serves as a habitat, creating a symbiotic relationship. And over time, lichen have evolved to appear in the most extreme environments, including around volcanoes. Their purpose varies depending on where they live, but lichen create oxygen, prevent erosion, provide nesting material, retain moisture and contribute to water cycling in ecosystems. They also serve as a food source for many species including some mammals, like reindeer. \"When you see a lichen, you're basically looking at all fungal tissue, with some algal cells hidden away and protected inside,\" Nelsen said. \"Loosely speaking, it's like a greenhouse -- the fungus creates a more hospitable environment for the algae.\"The level of diversity is just part of what makes lichen so charismatic to Nelsen. There are about 20,000 species of fungi that help form lichens -- more than all of the species of mammals and birds combined. \"They may be a bit more subtle and not as cute, but it's still a substantial amount of diversity out there,\" Nelsen said. However, he noted that lichen can appear stunning and almost otherworldly in nature.A changing worldIf the planet continues to warm at its current rate, that will outpace what many Trebouxia can adapt to, which could cause ripple effects. Toxic volcanic lake reveals how life may have been possible on ancient Mars\"In this study, we set out to learn how rapidly the climate preferences of these algae have evolved over time, and relate them to predictions about future rates of climate change,\" Nelsen said.  \"We found that the predicted rate of modern climate change vastly exceeds the rate at which these algae have evolved in the past. This means that certain parts of their range are likely to become inhospitable to them.\"Algae and lichen have been able to survive previous shifts in Earth's global temperatures, but climate change is causing those to occur much more quickly.\"Closely related algal species tend to have similar climatic preferences, as predicted by their evolutionary relationships,\" Nelsen said. \"The most closely related ones might live in really similar climates, whereas distantly related species might differ more in their climatic tolerance.\"Lichen takes many forms all over the world, like this spaghetti lichen growing in the Alaskan tundra.Future impactsWhen a climate changes, it's not uncommon to see plants or animals appear in new environments, where they compete with existing species. While it doesn't mean that the 7,000 Trebouxia algae will simply disappear, it indicates that changes are on the horizon. If the algae partner of lichen begins to die out, the fungus might be taken out as well, or the algae may have to slowly move to another area.\"I think we're going to see the ranges of these things shift, and that could lead to some shuffling of the relationships with fungi-- we might get partnerships that weren't there previously,\" Nelsen said. Sprawling sponge gardens found deep beneath the Arctic sea ice\"Since algae are the food source for the fungus, they're the ones photosynthesizing and making sugars to give to the fungus. If they're forced to move, then the fungal partner would either have to move too, or develop a new partnership.\"Going forward, Nelsen wants to determine how these lichen survive and even thrive in extreme and diverse environments, test the temperature range limits of algae they can withstand, and understand more about the fungus component of lichen and how it reacts to change. As the climate changes, algae may have to disperse to new environments and may not be able to thrive in extreme habitats, like the Alaskan tundra. Nelsen believes lichen research could be applied to other aspects of understanding how climate change will unfold. \"They have interesting stories behind them, and it's just kind of up to us to try to figure out what exactly they're doing out there in nature,\" Nelsen said.",

        "content": "(CNN)A new report provides an alarming forecast for the US: Sea level will rise as much in the next 30 years as it did in the past 100 -- increasing the frequency of high-tide flooding, pushing storm surge to the extreme and inundating vulnerable coastal infrastructure with saltwater. The interagency report, led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, shows how scientists are increasingly confident that US coasts will see another 10 to 12 inches of sea level rise by 2050.The implications of that forecast are enormous.Our underwater future: What sea level rise will look like around the globe\"This report is a wake-up call for the US, but it's a wake-up call with a silver lining,\" NOAA chief Rick Spinrad said at a news conference on Tuesday. \"It provides us with information needed to act now to best position ourselves for the future.\"The projected sea level rise will lead to a significant increase in the frequency of coastal flooding even on sunny days, scientists report. High-tide flood events in coastal cities -- New York, Washington, Miami and others -- have already doubled in annual frequency since 2000, turning what researchers say used to be a \"rare event\" into a \"disruptive problem.\"Read MoreEvery inch of sea level rise also amplifies hurricane storm surge, coastal erosion and wetland loss -- impacts which US coasts are already well familiar with.\"Decades ago, powerful storms were what typically caused coastal flooding,\" NOAA reports. Today, due to sea level rise, \"even common wind events and seasonal high tides regularly cause [high-tide flooding] within coastal communities, affecting homes and businesses, overloading stormwater and wastewater systems, infiltrating coastal groundwater aquifers with saltwater, and stressing coastal wetlands and estuarine ecosystems.\"The report didn't set out to quantify how expensive these events would get in the future or how they would impact the economy. But Nicole LeBeof, the director of NOAA's National Ocean Service, noted that millions of people live along the coast, and the rest rely on products that enter the country through ports on the coast. \"What I will say is that the magnitude of these impacts, direct and cascading, will be high,\" LeBeof said at a news conference. \"Forty percent of the US population lives within 60 miles of our coastlines. There will be highly variable impacts along those coastlines, but there's no denying that a large portion of our economy and revenue and tax base are right there, front and center.\"Catastrophic sea level riseBeyond 2050, the amount of sea level rise the US will experience is highly dependent on how much the world cuts fossil fuel emissions and limits global temperature rise. Robert Kopp, a climate scientist at Rutgers University and co-author on the report, said sea level rise is becoming \"increasingly sensitive to the amount of warming\" the planet is experiencing.For example, if global warming can be held to around 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels, NOAA estimates sea level rise in the US could be limited to 2 feet by the end of the century. If temperatures are allowed to skyrocket, that forecast increases to 7 feet.The ice shelf holding back the 'Doomsday glacier' could shatter within the next five years, scientists warnPart of the reason that range is so large is the uncertainty over future changes in the world's largest ice sheets and how they will respond to rapid temperature rise. Faster melting of the Greenland or West Antarctic ice sheets could lead to catastrophic sea level rise in the United States by the end of the century.Ben Hamlington, the sea level change team lead at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and a co-author on the report, pointed to the potential collapse of Antarctica's Thwaites glacier, also known as the \"Doomsday glacier,\" which scientists have said would lead to irreversible changes around the globe.\"We know where these different events could be triggered that would lead to rapid sea level rise, potentially,\" Hamlington told CNN. \"For right now, it's important that we build in that uncertainty into our scenarios, that possibility of that happening, and that's what we've done.\"William Sweet, oceanographer at NOAA's National Ocean Service and the lead author on the report, said it's important that this report gives decision-makers a range of plausible outcomes beyond 2050.\"Considering the knowns and unknowns are very important for certain types of decision making,\" Sweet said. \"Those that are very risk averse, who really can't stand to be wrong, need to know these types of outcomes.\"Storm surge and 'sunny day' floodingThe report serves as an update to the federal government's 2017 sea level projections, using tide gauge and satellite observations combined with findings from the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report to assess changes the country has already experienced and what is still to come.The frequency of high-tide flooding has grown substantially in the past two decades, the report shows. \"We already are seeing once-rare tidal flooding events becoming increasingly frequent,\" Kopp said. \"So today along the Jersey Shore, flooding events that used to happen in the 1950s every year or two are now happening for several days a year on average.\"A man kayaks through high-tide flood waters in downtown Annapolis, Maryland, on October 29, 2021.Twenty years ago, New York City would experience these \"sunny day\" flood events around five days a year; that frequency has now shot to 10 to 15 days. In Miami, Florida, and Charleston, South Carolina, the frequency ballooned from two days in 2000 to five to 10 days in 2020. Researchers say these increases will continue to accelerate and spread to other coastal cities in the next few decades. And sea level rise has already made tropical cyclones and hurricanes more deadly and more destructive. Storm surge \u2014 the water pushed onshore by a storm's winds \u2014 can now spread farther inland because of higher baseline sea level. 25% of all critical infrastructure in the US is at risk of failure due to flooding, new report findsA 2021 study, which Kopp also co-authored, found that sea level rise caused by the climate crisis added another $8 billion in flood damage to Superstorm Sandy's impacts.And as water piles up along the coast, rivers and streams that drain into the ocean can also be blocked, which forces water back upstream and extends the flooding farther inland. In 2021, Hurricane Ida's powerful storm surge reversed the flow of the Mississippi River near New Orleans \u2014 something the US Geological Survey said was \"extremely uncommon.\"All of these impacts worsen considerably with an additional foot of sea level rise through 2050.\"Today's disruptive, sunny day high tide flooding is a growing problem in many communities, but that will become damaging flooding in 30 years time due to this increase of a foot or more in many East and Gulf Coast communities,\" Sweet said. \"So what is now disruptive will become outright damaging to our infrastructure and to our commerce unless action is taken.\"Limiting the worstEven if the world can slash fossil fuel emissions in the coming decades and put a cap on global warming, the report emphasizes that the sea level rise projections are essentially locked in through 2050. Oceans will continue to climb due to the warming that humans have already caused. These lawmakers' districts are at highest risk of flooding. Here's where they stand on the climate crisis.And because tens of millions of people in the US already live in coastal areas at risk of flooding \u2014 with more people migrating to the coasts each year, partly due to ongoing land development \u2014 researchers say there will be a drastic rise in human exposure as well as the country's critical infrastructure.\"We need to collectively as a country understand that there's only so much sea level rise that can occur until real problems start surfacing in our communities,\" Sweet said. \"We need to recognize that it's largely an elevation issue at this point when storm surge flooding becomes replaced by tidal flooding.\"But we can limit the worst long-term outcomes by reducing fossil fuel emissions, researchers say. The high-end forecasts for 2100 can be avoided if fossil fuel emissions are slashed. \"The next 30 years are pretty well in our headlights right now,\" Sweet said. \"We can give actionable information, but beyond that, emissions matter.\"\"It's collectively in our hands to determine what our future scenario will actually be.\"This story has been updated with additional information.",

        "content": "A version of this article originally appeared in the weekly weather newsletter, which releases every Monday. You can sign up here to receive these every week and during significant storms.  (CNN)You might have heard over the weekend; a man survived an avalanche after falling off a 50-foot cliff while skiing in Colorado.Yes, you read that correctly. The sad truth of the matter is surviving an avalanche burial is rare. According to Jake Hutchinson, an avalanche rescuer and safety instructor in Utah, it's very rare. And recent studies show large-scale avalanches might be on the increase because of climate change. \"That's the hard part about the avalanche rescue world is that we very rarely can get people there in time to make it a live find,\" Hutchinson pointed out. \"Realistically, people have a really a pretty good chance of survival if they can be fully dug out in the first 15 to 30 minutes of burial.\" Hutchinson has been working in the avalanche rescue world for nearly 30 years and admitted he has lost count of the number of bodies he's recovered. He said it's not the cold and hypothermia that kills, it's the lack of oxygen. \"Unfortunately, that results in fatalities really quickly. And so, time is really against us.\" Rescuers working Dutch Draw avalanche in 2004 debris field, search for visual clues of people buried.Hutchinson remembers one avalanche he was lead rescuer on in 2004. The initial call indicated 28 people were buried. Twenty different organizations came to help sift through 40 acres of debris, an area about the size of 30 football fields.Read MoreA four-day operation resulted in only one person being buried and found deceased on the second day. The other 27 skiers who were presumed dead actually escaped the burial and were only enveloped in the avalanche cloud, not the avalanche itself.  He explained most avalanche fatalities come down to human error. Ninety percent of avalanche incidents are triggered by the victim or someone in the victim's party.  Going backcountry skiing without the proper equipment, without the proper training and making just one bad decision can make the difference in life and death.  \"You're walking out there to ski, and you don't take at least a basic avalanche course, you might as well be crossing a highway with a blindfold on. You might make it across, you might not,\" Hutchinson asserted.  It might sound harsh to some, but after more than 50 avalanche rescues Hutchinson has been a part of, with only a handful of live finds, it's the reality of how deadly avalanches are.  \"I think people underestimate either the potential of a slope, like what kind of avalanche it can create, or they have overconfidence in what I call margins, their margin between being Safe and hazardous.\"According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), most avalanches occur during or just after snowstorms on slopes between 30 and 45 degrees. They often occur when there is a weak layer of snow underneath freshly fallen snow. A weak layer of snow is a layer that doesn't stick well to the other layers. It could be from a change in temperature between the layers, or if a layer of frost gets buried under freshly fallen snow, which can cause weakness in the snow as well. It is usually where the snow will fracture, resulting in an avalanche.And it seems avalanches may become more frequent as the climate warms.  Saving lives in Colorado's backcountryAccording to a new study published by Nature in 2021, large-scale avalanches could become more common. The study states there is \"a potential increase in large magnitude events driven by warming temperatures and spring precipitation.\"  Hutchinson added he has seen an increase in large avalanches in recent years.  \"Absolutely. I think this current period has had some of the largest, late December early January avalanches, I remember seeing ever, and they're widespread all over the West.\"  He thinks it's a combination of the big early-season storms, followed by long dry periods, which creates a lot of weak snow. Then larger than usual storm systems occur on top of weak snow, which are producing exceptionally large avalanches. \"With a wetter and warmer snow climate, consequences of burial may become more severe,\" the authors wrote in a review on the 'Effects of Climate Change on Avalanche Accidents and Survival' published in 2021. Their review indicated avalanche activity will decrease in spring and at lower elevations but increase at higher elevations in winter because of more favorable conditions for wet-snow avalanches earlier in the season. It also mentions when avalanches do occur, they could be harder to survive because of the changes in snow density because of climate change.  With the potential for avalanches to increase, your risk while backcountry skiing could go up as well, especially if you aren't careful. JUST WATCHEDHow to survive an avalancheReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHow to survive an avalanche 02:10I recorded a \"how to survive an avalanche\" video for CNN several years ago and was \"buried\" in an avalanche on the mountainside of Steamboat Springs, Colorado, with the help of their avalanche rescue team. I was only buried for a few short moments (and it was all controlled), yet it was absolutely terrifying.  Hutchinson emphasized the best way for people to survive an avalanche burial is \"to have well-trained partners with proper avalanche rescue gear. That is just the sad reality of it. And it's pretty rare for organized rescue to be able to get there in time to make a difference, and it does become recovery.\" Hutchinson noted three tools should absolutely be with you at all times while backcountry skiing: Beacon Shovel Probe He advised to always get the forecast before you go as well.

And it's a huge dopamine high and when you get away with it, that's a really huge hit to the reward center of your brain,\" Hutchinson acknowledged. But he added, \"It doesn't matter what cool thing you did in the mountains if you didn't come home to talk about it, because coming home at the end of the day is the most important part of all this.\"",

        "content": "Los Angeles (CNN)The West is in its worst drought in centuries, scientists reported Monday.A study published in Nature Climate Change found the period from 2000 to 2021 was the driest in 1,200 years. Last year's drought severity was \"exceptional,\" researchers said, and all indications are the extreme conditions will continue through 2022.The human-caused climate crisis has made the megadrought 72% worse, the study noted.Burning fossil fuels is having a direct impact on water availability in the West, which for the past two decades has been characterized by dry weather, with hopeful but fleeting bursts of precipitation.You don't have to look further than Los Angeles in December for an example. With nearly 10 inches of rain, it was the second-wettest such month on record for the city, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.17 feet of snow sparked hope for quelling California's drought. Then precipitation 'flatlined' in JanuaryRead MoreBut the dreams of drought remediation were dashed when it became clear the jet stream did not have more lined up in the new year. Last month, less than a tenth of an inch of rain fell in Los Angeles, making it the eighth-driest January on record for the city. Halfway through February, things are only getting worse. This year is off to a record-dry start.Fluctuations like these are becoming more pronounced due to climate change.\"There's good documentation that, in fact, there is less rainfall. What seems to be happening according to most of the climate scientists is we're getting longer, drier periods,\" said David Feldman, professor of urban planning and public policy at University of California at Irvine, and director of Water UCI. \"But the irony is those longer, drier periods are punctuated by very intense storm events.\"Park Williams, a climate scientist at UCLA and the study's lead author, said it will take several years of above-average rain and snowfall to cut through the megadrought. \"It's extremely unlikely that this drought can be ended in one wet year,\" he said.A rainy day saved for laterOfficials in Los Angeles are acutely aware of the water fluctuations and are working to capture every drop possible. Los Angeles County has dug several large, open dirt basins -- known as spreading grounds -- to absorb rainfall and recharge underground aquifers. The basins also take in water diverted from dams.\"When we know that we're going to get significant storms in the LA area, we obviously work really closely with LA County flood control,\" said Anselmo Collins, senior assistant general manager of the water system for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. \"If they happen to have a lot of water stored in their flood control dams, they can release that water ahead of time; give it an opportunity to percolate and make room in those dams and the reservoirs to be able to collect the water that's coming in at the same time.\"The water's slow journey of filtering down through the soil into the aquifers also cleans the water, Collins explained.\"When we pump it later on, we treat it again, and then it goes into our water distribution system, and it will get treated again,\" said Collins, noting LADWP's rigorous water treatment program. \"When you talk about water, it's something very personal to people ... it's something you put into your body.\"Secondary clarifier tanks at the Hyperion Water Reclamation Plant in Los Angeles.Ultimately, Los Angeles is working to become less dependent on imported water. Currently, as much as 90% of water used in Los Angeles is imported from Northern California, the Sierra Nevada Mountains and the Colorado River Basin. The plan, which is in progress, calls for 70% of the city's water to be locally sourced by 2035.\"One of our major focuses is on recycled water and, in fact, this is a goal that the city of Los Angeles has, to recycle 100% of all wastewater,\" said Traci Minamide, chief operating officer of Los Angeles Sanitation and Environment. \"That will help us provide a local source of water that's sustainable and consistent.\"All the Beijing snow is human-made -- a resource-intensive, 'dangerous' trend as planet warmsAnd she does mean 100% of all wastewater.\"The recycled water is coming through the wastewater collection system, across our whole network of 6,500 miles of sewers. It's coming from all the residents and commercial businesses,\" Minamide said. \"It's all the stuff and then breaking it out and then cleaning it up after that.\"Minamide explained the water is treated to a very high purity -- better than distilled water, she said -- before it is supplied for groundwater infiltration, which is later pumped up, treated and used for drinking water.LA Sanitation and Environment is already treating and supplying up to 12 million gallons a day to the aquifers, but Minamide said they are planning to boost the figure to more than 200 million gallons a day.\"Hyperion Water Reclamation Plant is one of the largest treatment plants in the country and that water right now is being treated and discharged. We're just losing it out to Santa Monica Bay,\" Minamide said. \"There's an opportunity for us to treat that water in a very advanced fashion under regulations, to a point where it can actually be used to help the water supply system.\"Hydrogen peroxide removal tanks for the treatment of groundwater at the North Hollywood West Wellhead Treatment Facility in Los Angeles.Sanitation and Environment also has other dry weather diversion projects aimed at capturing runoff on the city's streets, cleaning up water and then offering it for irrigation locally. In other parts of town, the landscape is designed for the ground to absorb the water right where it is into aquifers and some renovations are required to factor in water conservation, for example, switching to permeable pavers instead of asphalt.A 'political and social' questionAs climate change continues to pound the region, leading to less rain and more excessively hot days, Los Angeles is using innovations to manage the city's water needs down the line. \"Whether we will in fact manage it is a political and a social question, not a technical one. The technologies are there,\" said Feldman.The drought in California this summer was the worst on recordWhile some projects slated to store much more water are years away, experts say it might have been harder to get legislation passed if residents weren't on board. A couple of decades ago, voters might not have been willing to pay more in taxes to recycle water and capture rainfall when conserving water wasn't a hot topic. However, now it seems the will is there.Minamide pointed to data which shows more people are concerned about being wasteful.\"Despite the increase in the population over the past 20 years of roughly a million, we have seen our water use, and then our wastewater commensurately, actually go down,\" Minamide said.So people are saving water, but more could be done. \"I'd like to see for us to get smart on our end uses of water. Don't use as much water for outdoor landscaping,\" offered Feldman. \"Think about ways of replacing and more efficiently using our appliances.\"In fact, the largest hurdle may be getting people to change how they think about water.\"Water isn't free,\" Feldman said. \"Somebody has to go and acquire the water, treat it, distribute it to our homes and then treat the wastewater after it leaves our homes. We need to think about water as a precious commodity.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)The vast majority of critical minerals and rare earth elements that help power electric vehicles and wind turbines come from mining operations overseas. But a new initiative spearheaded by the US Department of Energy is looking for ways to extract them from fossil fuel waste. The Energy Department plans to build the nation's first large facility to extract critical minerals like nickel and cobalt from waste like coal ash. Those metals could then be used in components for renewable-energy batteries, cell phones and electric vehicles, among other technologies. On Monday, the department is releasing a request for information from industry, developers and research institutions on how to build and operate the new facility, shared first with CNN.  A giant donut-shaped machine just proved a near-limitless clean power source is possible\"Since we get fossil fuels from the earth, there's a lot of other components other than just the carbons,\" Jennifer Wilcox, the principal deputy assistant secretary for the Department of Energy's Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management, told CNN. \"There's critical minerals like cobalt and nickel, and there's also rare earth elements.\" As demand for critical minerals surges, the US is at a supply-chain disadvantage for them. The US currently imports more than 80% of its rare earth elements from offshore suppliers. Much of its critical mineral supply needed to power batteries is also shipped from overseas.  Read MoreChina in particular has cornered the global market on processing critical minerals and rare earth elements, but countries including Australia and Malaysia are also involved. Department of Energy officials like Wilcox see coal waste as a new opportunity to make the US less reliant on foreign supply. Even so, it will take years to realize this vision. The new facility -- which the department plans to construct by 2026 and have operational by 2028 -- will both refine materials and show private industry how to scale up extraction of rare earth elements and critical minerals from used fossil fuels. The department aims to have the facility be able to process about 1,000 metric tons of mixed rare earth oxides, increasing that to 10,000 metric tons per year by 2035 and 20,000 metric tons per year by 2040. And although foreign countries lead the US in processing critical minerals from mining, this concept of processing fossil fuel waste for minerals is a relatively new and untested one. \"I think we are really in the lead on these concepts,\" Wilcox said.  Focusing on coal waste As the US tries to build out its domestic mining supply, it should also pursue secondary sources of obtaining the material, said Sarma Pisupati, an energy professor and minerals expert at Penn State University. \"We need to find domestic sources, and secondary sources are important to look at,\" said Pisupati. \"These are coming from waste piles particularly. If we can develop the technology, we can clean up the environment as well as get these resources.\" The West's megadrought is worst in 1,200 years. Los Angeles is taking wastewater recycling to the extremeThe project will primarily focus on extracting minerals from coal waste. However, byproducts from oil and gas drilling -- such as the water used to extract the fuel -- can also be good sources of minerals like lithium.  \"This is really focused on coal, but it doesn't mean that what we learn from the chemical, physical, thermal extraction processes we're investing in -- that they can't also be applied to other energy resources as well,\" Wilcox said. \"That's what we would like to see in the future.\" A site for the refinery hasn't yet been selected, but the request for information process will help the department scout a location. Still, Wilcox told CNN that a region with heavy coal waste concentrations like Appalachia, Wyoming or North Dakota could make a good location. \"Absolutely in regions where there's been legacy fossil production, but also looking at these for an opportunity for these communities to transition,\" Wilcox said. Ultimately, she added, the mineral extraction technology developed by the Department of Energy could be transported to sites of coal waste all around the country to extract critical minerals and rare earth elements. Pisupati told CNN that an important job of a processing facility would also be identifying and cataloging what kinds of coal ash and other waste materials can actually be used to build batteries. \"Not all coal ash samples would have the highest concentration\" of critical minerals, he said.   Another challenge is that there will be smaller concentrations of critical minerals found in fossil fuel waste, compared with the concentrations that can be mined directly from rocks in the earth, Wilcox said. Separating them out can be expensive, which is why the Department of Energy is aiming to pilot the research and technology first.",

(CNN)African elephants have drastically dwindled as targets of the illegal ivory trade, but the DNA contained within their tusks is pointing to the very criminal networks that poached them.Researchers used genetic testing on ivory shipments seized by law enforcement and were able to trace the international crime ring shipping the ivory from Africa. The team tested more than 4,000 elephant tusks from 49 different seizures, made between 2002 and 2019, across 12 different African countries. The findings published Monday in the journal Nature Human Behaviour.The study establishes familial connections between the elephants that are being poached for their ivory tusks and reveals the poaching and shipping practices and interconnectedness of the traffickers. This kind of DNA detective work can expose the tactics employed by transnational criminal organizations, believes the research team, comprised of scientists and US Department of Homeland Security special agents. These illicit organizations have operated out of Africa for decades, leading to the heavy decline of thousands of elephants in recent years, according to the study.Read MoreElephant DNA helps authorities make $3.5 million international ivory trafficking bust\"These methods are showing us that a handful of networks are behind a majority of smuggled ivory, and that the connections between these networks are deeper than even our previous research showed,\" said lead study author Samuel Wasser, a University of Washington professor of biology and co-executive director of the Center for Environmental Forensic Science, in a statement. Linking elephant family membersDrawing connections between the separate seizures of ivory made at ports that were thousands of miles apart can create a trail of evidence and strengthen cases against those arrested for poaching and smuggling the tusks.This study builds on previous work, published by Wasser and his colleagues in 2018, which showed tusks from the same elephant were often separated and smuggled in different shipments before being seized. These identifications linked the trafficking networks that smuggled ivory from three African port cities in Kenya, Uganda and Togo.The new research broadened the DNA analysis to find elephants that were related in some way, including parents, offspring and siblings. Drawing connections between families of elephants, rather than trying to match individual tusks, helped the researchers understand the scope of the trafficking network.The three networks established in the 2018 study \"are involved with many more seizures and more connected to each other than previously discovered,\" according to the new paper.\"If you're trying to match one tusk to its pair, you have a low chance of a match. But identifying close relatives is going to be a much more common event, and can link more ivory seizures to the same smuggling networks,\" Wasser said.Special Agent John Brown, study coauthor and  a criminal investigator with US Homeland Security Investigations, has worked on environmental crime issues for more than 25 years. The forensic analysis in the study can provide \"a roadmap for far-reaching multinational collaborative investigations,\" Brown said.Targeted populationsThe tusks came from both forest elephants and savannah elephants. Forest elephants represent about 6% of the remaining African elephant population and live in the humid forests of West Africa and the Congo Basin. Based on the tusk data from the seizures, tusks were heavily poached from Gabon and Republic of the Congo.DNA tests on elephant tusks expose 'three major export cartels operating in Africa'Savannah elephants roam across the grassy plains and bushlands in West and Central Africa and most of East and Southern Africa. Many of their tusks were poached in Tanzania, northern Mozambique and southern Kenya -- including some from the Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area of southern Africa most recently. Then, the tusks were shipped from ports in different countries. But the fact that the separated tusks were still shipped from the same ports helped the researchers determine there were fewer networks moving mass ivory shipments than previously suspected, Wasser said.In elephant populations, females tend to remain in the same family group and males don't move very far even when they emigrate. The genetic connection between the tusks showed how the poachers were targeting specific populations. Dozens of shipments were found to have tight familial connections, some of which spanned years.\"Identifying close relatives indicates that poachers are likely going back to the same populations repeatedly -- year after year -- and tusks are then acquired and smuggled out of Africa on container ships by the same criminal network,\" Wasser said. \"This criminal strategy makes it much harder for authorities to track and seize these shipments because of the immense pressure they are under to move large volumes of containers quickly through ports.\"Holding traffickers accountableA small group of smuggling networks are the most likely ones responsible for large ivory shipments, which can move mass quantities of tusks on container ships. The genetic data from the tusks linked seizures from the Ivory Coast along the Atlantic Ocean to Mozambique, bordering the Indian Ocean.\"There has been a lot of movement to make the sale of ivory illegal in many countries around the world,\" Wasser said. \"However, it has not had a great impact on the kinds of trade that we are talking about when we're getting these big seizures. And when I say a big seizure, it's a minimum size of a half-ton and that can go up to 10 tons or more.\"The 17-year span of the study also showed how the networks have shifted to different ports over time, moving from Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda to Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.Criminals are often linked with one ivory shipment seizure, or \"one block of physical evidence,\" Brown said. But tracking this kind of data could help prosecutors establish links and ensure the criminals are held accountable for everything they've done. \"Extinction of species and ecological collapse through wildlife trafficking can have long-lasting, irreversible, catastrophic impacts on our global community as a whole,\" Brown said. \"So the global effort to combat these illicit crimes is paramount to protecting our environment.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)A federal judge reversed a Trump administration decision that removed the gray wolf from the endangered species list in the continental United States after a coalition of wildlife organizations argued the move seriously threatened the animal's population. On Thursday, US District Judge Jeffrey S. White in Northern California ruled in favor of a lawsuit brought by the Humane Society of the United States and other wildlife organizations against the US Department of the Interior in January 2021. The US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) \"failed to adequately analyze and consider the impacts of partial delisting and of historical range loss on the already-listed species,\" White wrote in his decision, which restored gray wolf protections in 45 states. The lawsuit claimed the USFWS did not take proper consideration when it stripped the animal of Endangered Species Act (ESA) protections, which went into effect in January 2021, under the assumption its population sufficiently recovered. \"Today is a monumental victory for wolves who will now be protected from state-sponsored bloodbaths,\" Kitty Block, president and CEO of the Humane Society, said in a statement. Read More\"After having yet another wolf delisting overturned in federal court, the US Fish and Wildlife Service should finally learn its lesson,\" she added. \"Instead of continuing to devise convoluted excuses to strip these beloved animals of legal protections, the agency must develop a plan for meaningful recovery across the species' range and ensure that states will not decimate their wolf populations.\" The federal government has 60 days to appeal the court's decision. Only the Northern Rockies population of wolves remains unprotected as a result of laws that passed in Idaho and Montana, according to the Humane Society, but the USFWS is currently considering relisting them to the act. Six Native American Ojibwe tribes also sued the state of Wisconsin last year, claiming the state's planned wolf hunts go against their treaty-protected rights, CNN previously reported.  After the species were stripped of federal protections, Wisconsin hunters killed more than 215 wolves in under three days as part of a February 2021 trophy hunting season, exceeding the state's quote by nearly double, according to the Humane Society. The gray wolf received protection from the ESA in the 1970s, when the population dwindled due to declines in their populations and frequent conflict with farmers and ranchers. Certain wolf populations on the West Coast and in the Southern Rocky Mountains are especially vulnerable and were at risk of \"disappearing forever\" as a result of the Trump-era decision, the Humane Society said in a statement when the lawsuit was filed. \"Our lawsuit argues that by treating the plight of these fragile populations as insignificant and ignoring the natural and manmade threats that wolves nationwide still face, the government is in violation of the Endangered Species Act and its legal duty of protecting wolves and helping them recover,\" the statement read.Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, who took part in an amicus brief in the coalition's lawsuit, said her state is home to roughly 700 gray wolves. \"These magnificent animals serve important roles in our Great Lakes ecosystems, and they show us that dedication to family is not unique to humans,\" Nessel said in a statement. Some hunter advocacy groups rejected the decision, however, arguing it will affect predator management programs that aim to reduce predation. \"We are disappointed that an activist judge from California decided to tell farmers, ranchers, and anyone who supports a balanced ecosystem with common-sense predator management that he knows better than them,\" said Hunter Nation President and CEO Luke Hilgemann in a statement. \"At Hunter Nation, we prefer to trust local experts and conservation and hunting partners to come up with predator management programs that make sense for them rather than putting our faith in bureaucrats who don't spend time in the woods or never have to deal with the negative consequences of an uncontrolled wolf population.\"Amanda Jackson contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)A Trump-appointed judge dealt another blow to Biden's climate agenda on Friday, barring the administration from using a metric that estimates the societal cost of carbon emissions.US District Judge James Cain of the Western District of Louisiana issued an injunction on Friday that prevents the Biden administration from using what's known as the \"social cost of carbon\" in decisions around oil and gas drilling on public land or in rules that govern fossil fuel emissions.The metric uses economic models to put a value on each ton of carbon dioxide emissions, to help quantify the economic harm caused by the climate crisis: sea level rise, more destructive hurricanes, extreme wildfire seasons and flooding, for example.A giant donut-shaped machine just proved a near-limitless clean power source is possibleAgencies then weigh that economic harm in decisions that involve things like emissions regulations or fossil fuel drilling approvals.It was first implemented during the Obama administration and substantially weakened by the Trump administration. Biden revived the social cost of carbon on his first day in office, setting it at $51 per ton of CO2 emissions -- the same level as set by the Obama administration. Read MoreThe Biden administration had not yet used the metric in many decisions, but was expected to release an updated figure later this month.Ten Republican-led states brought the lawsuit against the Biden administration. In his ruling, Cain sided with the states, saying the administration's carbon cost estimate \"will significantly drive up costs\" while decreasing state revenue.Cain added that his home state of Louisiana \"will be directly harmed by the reduction of funds necessary to maintain the state's coastal lands.\"The Department of Justice did not immediately return a request for comment.Earthjustice attorney Hana Vizcarra, whose organization is not involved in the case, said she'd be surprised if the government's attorneys didn't appeal.\"I can't imagine not appealing this, if I were the Justice Department,\" Vizcarra said. A home collapsed into the ocean as rising seas eat away at the North Carolina coastVizcarra added there's not much legal precedent to support Cain's ruling, as a similar lawsuit brought by Republican states was tossed by an Obama-appointed federal judge in Missouri last year.Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry praised the decision in a statement. \"Biden's attempt to control the activities of the American people and the activities of every business from Main Street to Wall Street has been halted today,\" Landry said. \"Biden's executive order was an attempt by the government to take over and tax the people based on winners and losers chosen by the government.\"This is not the first time a Trump-appointed judge has dealt a blow to the Biden administration's climate goals. In June, another federal judge in Louisiana blocked Biden's temporary pause on new oil and gas leasing on federal lands -- saying Biden had exceeded his authority.That decision paved the way for the Department of Interior to hold a November auction for oil and gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. Even though administration officials insisted at the time it ran counter to their climate goals, they maintained they had to follow the law. A federal judge in DC District Court later invalidated the sale.Biden's administration will face perhaps the most serious legal challenge to climate policies later this month in a US Supreme Court case that could limit the EPA's ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.This story has been updated with additional information.",

(CNN)Thousands of birds die each spring and fall when they collide with Chicago's skyscrapers, which lie on a major migration path between Canada and Latin America. But the birds don't die in vain. Since the 1970s, many of them have been collected from the street and cataloged by the city's Field Museum. This unique and detailed set of data has been a scientific windfall, revealing that North American migratory birds appear to be shrinking in response to climate change. A new study of this data has highlighted an important nuance in this trend: Birds that have bigger brains, relative to their body size, are not shrinking as much as their smaller-brained counterparts.Climate change could be making birds shrink in size, study findsThe study is the first to identify a potential link between cognition and animal response to human-made climate change, according to the researchers from Washington University in St. Louis.\"As temperatures warm, body sizes are decreasing,\" said Justin Baldwin, a doctoral student at Washington University and author of the study that published this week in the journal Ecology Letters, in a news release. \"But larger-brained species are declining less strongly than small-brained species.\"Since the 1970s, migratory birds that died after colliding with Chicago buildings have been collected and cataloged by the Field Museum. The data set is showing how birds are affected by climate change. Read MoreRelative brain size is often considered an indicator of behavioral flexibility in birds, according to the research. The idea is controversial when it's applied to some other animals, Baldwin said, but it works for birds.\"Relative brain size correlates with increased learning ability, increased memory, longer lifespans and more stable population dynamics,\" Baldwin said.\"In this case, a bigger-brained species of bird might be able to reduce its exposure to warming temperatures by seeking out microhabitats with cooler temperatures, for example,\" he said.The climate crisis is messing with birds' body shapesThe researchers analyzed information from 70,000 birds that died when they collided with buildings in Chicago between 1978 and 2016. They added brain volume measurements and life-span data for 49 of the 52 species in the database.Birds that had big brains, relative to their bodies such as the song sparrow and other New World sparrows, had body-size reductions that were only about one-third of those observed for birds with smaller brains, the study found. Wood warblers (Parulidae) tended to have smaller brains and tended to shrink more. \"The authors from that amazing study shared their raw data ... which allowed us to add to it and discover more,\" Baldwin said via email.A Blackburnian warbler, pictured here, was another of the species of smaller-brained birds that were more strongly affected by climate change.  Shape-shifters It's not known exactly why birds are shrinking in size. Larger body size helps animals in cold places stay warm, while a smaller body retains less heat. Bird wingspans may have increased to compensate for smaller bodies that produce less energy for the incredibly long distances traveled during migration, researchers have also found.Similarly, other research has found that some animals are developing larger beaks, legs and ears that allow them to better regulate body temperature as the planet gets hotter. While most of the morphological changes have been in birds, bats and shrews have also been affected. Climate change has even altered human bodies.Animals are 'shape shifting' in response to climate changeHowever, downsizing comes at a potential cost for a bird, with an increased risk of falling prey to predators or making it harder to compete for resources with other bird species, said study coauthor Carlos Botero, assistant professor of biology at Washington University, in the statement. It's in this context that having a larger brain may offer alternatives that are not available to small-brained species, he said. \"One of the first things that jumps out to me from these findings is that we can already see that climate change is having a disproportionate effect on species that have less capacity to deal with environmental change through their behavior,\" Botero said.\"This doesn't mean that climate change is not affecting brainy birds ... or that brainy birds are going to do just fine. What our findings suggest is that climate change can have a much stronger effect on the less-brainy birds.\"",

        "content": "Paris (CNN Business)France has announced plans to build up to 14 new nuclear reactors in a move that could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide a buffer against volatile energy prices.President Emmanuel Macron said Thursday that France would construct six nuclear reactors, and study the possibility of commissioning a further eight.\"Given the electricity needs, the need to also anticipate the transition and the end of the existing fleet, which cannot be extended indefinitely, we are going to launch today a program of new nuclear reactors,\" Macron said.Construction will commence in 2028, and the first new reactor could be commissioned by 2035. The push deeper into nuclear marks a policy reversal for Macron, who promised four years ago to close 12 nuclear reactors as part of a move away from the power source. France was forced to turn to coal power this winter to meet its energy needs after more than a fifth of the country's nuclear reactors went offline.Read MoreFrance wasn't the only country in Europe to struggle this winter as wholesale gas prices spiked to record levels, pushing up heating bills for households across the continent. Struggling consumers in France received payments and grants from the government to help defray costs.Barbara Pompili, France's minister for energy transition, said the nuclear policy shift was needed due to an \"acceleration\" of the \"unprecedented\" energy situation.\"To have more electricity, we need to produce more,\" Pompili told CNN affiliate BFMTV.\"Even if we develop a lot our renewable energies, we have a nuclear sector that constitutes 70% of our electricity supply, we have to use this sector as much as possible,\" Pompili added.French President Emmanuel Macron delivers a speech at the GE Steam Power System main production site for its nuclear turbine systems on February 10, 2022.Climate concernsNuclear power is a low-carbon source of energy. But nuclear plants are notoriously expensive to build, and construction tends to run over budget and time. How to safely store the radioactive waste it produces is another headache. Despite those limitations, some analysts argue the technology has a big role to play in addressing climate change.The International Energy Agency says that nuclear power generation should more than double between 2020 and 2050 in the pursuit of net zero. Its share in the electricity mix will drop, but that's because demand for power will soar as the world electrifies as many machines as possible, including cars and other vehicles.The European Commission was criticized earlier this month when it unveiled a proposal to designate natural gas and nuclear power \"sustainable\" sources of energy.Including the energy sources on the EU green list could unlock a wave of private investment into new nuclear and gas projects. But the plans have angered climate activists and could still be blocked by European lawmakers, who are also deeply divided over the issue along national and political lines.The European Union is aiming to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 55% from 1990 levels by 2030 and become a net-zero-emissions economy by 2050. Net zero is where emissions are dramatically reduced, and any that remain are offset, whether using natural methods like tree planting or technology to \"capture\" emissions. \u2014 Julia Horowitz, Ivana Kottasov\u00e1 and Angela Dewan contributed reporting.",

        "content": "New York (CNN Business)SpaceX CEO Elon Musk spoke for over an hour Thursday night in a hotly anticipated discussion about Starship, which the company hopes will one day take humans to Mars and that will play a key role in NASA's plans to return humans to the moon for the first time in a half century. Still, not many new details were shared.Musk once again said that he wants to pursue a city on Mars, but did not provide any updates in regard to who would live there or how it would be governed. And he reiterated how some design changes, like an updated rocket engine design, will help reduce costs.Many more unanswered questions remain. NASA has awarded SpaceX a contract to take astronauts to the moon, but Musk did not delineate what testing SpaceX will have to do before it can carry out its promised crewed missions, nor what the roadmap will look like to getting Starship ready for a moon or Mars mission.But Musk used the media event to engage with his core fanbase and employees, touting the company's progress during a speech that was back-grounded by the full Starship vehicle \u2014 spacecraft and rocket \u2014 on a launch pad just behind Musk at the company's South Texas facilities. SpaceX has been working at a rapid clip to get Starship ready for launch, but so far the company has only sent early prototypes on a few so-called \"hop tests,\" and it's still waiting for regulatory approval to put the vehicle atop its gargantuan rocket booster and attempt to send it to orbit. Musk said that the company had managed to lower the cost and weight of its individual Raptor rocket engines, in large part by consolidating parts and changing flanges to welds in the design. Musk also said that the second generation of the Raptor engine would produce more thrust than the first generation.Read MoreThe update comes more than two years after Musk announced Starship's first space tourism customer, Japanese fashion mogul Yusaku Maezawa. Maezawa paid SpaceX an undisclosed amount of money to secure a seat for himself and a group of artists on a Starship trip around the moon, hoping it could take off as soon as 2023. Maezawa is still in the process of deciding who he'll take with him. Musk did hint that there will be more Starship sales announced in the future, but declined to share Thursday, noting he didn't want to steal the spotlight from customers who may be planning their own announcements. All about StarshipStarship is at the core of SpaceX's plans to develop the technology necessary to establish a human settlement on Mars. SpaceX has achieved regular crewed flights to the International Space Station, sent the first all-tourist crew to orbit, and made its mark as the exciting-newcomer-turned-reliable-mainstay of the US aerospace industry.But as NASA demonstrated in the mid-20th century, going from brief jaunts to space to getting a spacecraft all the way to the moon isn't easy. And to this day, no human has ever traveled as far as Mars. For all of Musk and SpaceX's achievements, there is still a long way to go. And for all that Musk has achieved, he has also accrued a reputation for missed deadlines on ambitious projects. Space industry year ahead: SpaceX's Mars rocket, tourism, and more billionaire battlesSince 2019, however, SpaceX has mostly been in show-don't-tell mode, executing about a dozen test flights of various early prototypes that went from hopping a few feet off the ground to soaring more than 30,000 feet. A few high-altitude tests ended in explosions as the test rockets smashed back into the ground. But its latest test launch, in May 2021, managed to land upright without bursting into flames.  Lately, SpaceX has largely been waiting for federal regulators to clear the full-scale Starship for the first orbital launch attempt. It'll be no small feat \u2014 getting to orbit requires speeds that exceed 22 times the speed of sound, and to get the Starship spacecraft moving that fast, it'll ride atop a towering rocket booster, called Super Heavy, affixed with roughly 30 high-powered engines. And even then, going to Mars entails more challenges than just building a rocket to get there. On Thursday, SpaceX showed off the vehicle fully stacked, with the Starship spacecraft sitting atop its Super Heavy booster on the company's newly constructed orbital launch pad that lies next to a remote stretch of beach on the Gulf of Mexico. Large \"grabber arms\" held the rocket in place, as Musk's dream of rapidly reusable rockets would entail a need for the rocket to return to its launchpad after hurling its payload into orbit.If successful, Starship will become the most powerful rocket humanity has ever launched, boasting up to twice the power of the Saturn V rocket NASA used to take astronauts to the moon in the 1960s. FAA approvalBefore Starship can even get to space, however, SpaceX needs to get a thumbs up from the Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial space launches in the United States. Musk had indicated the company was prepared to launch Starship's orbital test flight as soon as July of last year. But the back half of 2021 was full of hangups. The FAA was carrying out an environmental assessment to review what the impact would be of launching such a massive rocket from a stretch of rural Texas coastline. A public comment period in October aired the voices of many local residents strongly opposed to the idea, as well as some fervent supporters who weren't necessarily from the area.Judge rules against Blue Origin in standoff with SpaceX, NASAThough SpaceX initially expected to get the all-clear by the end of 2021, according to the FAA, the environmental assessment will continue until at least February 28, 2022.The agency cited \"the high volume of comments submitted\" and \"discussions and consultation efforts with consulting parties\" as reasons for the delay.Musk did not provide a firm update on the anticipated approval, but said that if the FAA required a more thorough review, the company would likely shift some operations to Cape Kennedy in Florida.CNN's Rachel Crane contributed",

        "content": "(CNN)At a meeting with energy executives on Wednesday, President Joe Biden made what might seem like a bit of an odd comment. \"Are you getting less resistance when you start talking about wind and the windmills?\" Biden asked. \"I know they cause cancer. [Laughter.] Bad joke. I shouldn't kid about that. I shouldn't have kidded.\"What, exactly, was Biden talking about? Well, he seemed to be referencing former President Donald Trump's obsession with windmills -- and his predecessor's false claims that they are shown to cause cancer. The history of Trump's animosity toward windmills is long -- and deeply personal.Back in the mid-2000s, Trump bought land in Aberdeen, Scotland, on which he planned to build a luxury golf course and resort. Shortly thereafter, he became aware of -- and opposed -- a plan to build 11 wind turbines off the Scottish coast.Read More\"I am not thrilled,\" Trump said in 2006, according to the BBC. \"I want to see the ocean, I do not want to see windmills.\" And he didn't stop there. Not by a long shot.\"This is a very, very serious problem that we are addressing. In my opinion, it is one of the most serious problems that Scotland will have or has had,\" Trump told the Scottish Parliament in 2012 as he sought to keep the wind farm from being built. Trump added: \"I am an expert on tourism. If you dot your landscape with these horrible, horrible structures, you will do tremendous damage. ... Many countries have decided they don't want wind, because it doesn't work without massive subsidies, it kills massive amounts of birds and wildlife, and there are lots of other reasons.\"In 2013, Trump tweeted about high winds damaging a turbine in Scotland and added this important message: \"Any turbine in close proximity to a school must go!\" That same year, Trump had this message for the Scots: \"Economics behind ugly, bird killing wind turbines do not work -- will destroy Scotland's beautiful coastline.\"Despite Trump's dire warnings, the wind turbines were built anyway. The UK Supreme Court ruled against his lawsuit to block the construction in 2015. The 11-turbine facility was completed in 2018. Trump was ordered to pay the Scottish government's legal bills for the wind turbine fight in 2019.Getting elected president did nothing to change Trump's vendetta against windmills. If anything, he became even more outspoken.\"If you have a windmill anywhere near your house, congratulations, your house just went down 75% in value,\" Trump told House Republicans when he spoke at a fundraiser in April 2019. \"And they say the noise causes cancer.\"  (Fact Check: Not true!)And on the 2020 campaign trail, Trump worked windmills into his regular riff.\"If Hillary (Clinton) got in ... you'd be doing wind. Windmills,\" he said at a campaign rally in Michigan in the spring of 2019. \"And if it doesn't blow, you can forget about television for that night. 'Darling, I want to watch television. I'm sorry! The wind isn't blowing.' ... I know a lot about wind.\"And then there was this from an August 2019 rally in Pittsburgh:\"Unlike those big windmills that destroy everybody's property values, kill all the birds,\" Trump said. \"One day, the environmentalists are going to tell us what's going on with that. And then all of a sudden, it stops. The wind and the televisions go off. And your wives and husbands say: 'Darling, I want to watch Donald Trump on television tonight. But the wind stopped blowing and I can't watch. There's no electricity in the house, darling.'\"And this from December 2019 speech in Florida:\"I never understood wind. You know, I know windmills very much,\" Trump said. \"They're noisy. They kill the birds. You want to see a bird graveyard? Go under a windmill someday. You'll see more birds than you've ever seen in your life.\"Donald Trump has been consistent about very few things in his life -- and political career. But he's always hated windmills.",

        "content": "(CNN)There's no silver bullet to the climate crisis, but nuclear fusion may be the closest thing to it. In the quest for a near-limitless, zero-carbon source of reliable power, scientists have generated fusion energy before, but they have struggled for decades to sustain it for very long. On Wednesday, however, scientists working in the United Kingdom announced that they more than doubled the previous record for generating and sustaining nuclear fusion, which is the same process that allows the sun and stars to shine so brightly.Nuclear fusion is, as its name suggests, the fusing of two or more atoms into one larger one, a process that unleashes a tremendous amount of energy as heat.The core of the JET tokamak machine in Culham, England. Nuclear power used today is created by a different process, called fission, which relies on splitting, rather than fusing, atoms. But that process creates waste that can remain radioactive for tens of thousands of years. It's also potentially hazardous in the event of an accident, such as Japan's 2011 Fukushima disaster, triggered by an earthquake and tsunami. Fusion, on the other hand, is much safer, can produce little waste and requires only small amounts of abundant, naturally-sourced fuel, including elements extracted from seawater. This makes it an attractive option as the world transitions away from the fossil fuels driving climate change.Read MoreIn a giant donut-shaped machine known as a tokamak, scientists working in the English village of Culham, near Oxford, were able to generate a record-breaking 59 megajoules of sustained fusion energy over five seconds on December 21 last year. Five seconds is the limit the machine can sustain the power before its magnets overheat. \n\n\n\n\nThe JET tokamak near Oxford, England, produced a record amount of sustained energy from nuclear fusion. Credit: EUROFusion. \nA magnetic field is required to contain the high temperatures needed to carry out the fusion process, which can be as high as 150 million degrees Celsius, 10 times hotter than the center of the sun.\"Our experiment showed for the first time that it's possible to have a sustained fusion process using exactly the same fuel mix planned for future fusion power plants,\" Tony Donn\u00e9, CEO of EUROfusion, said at a press conference.EUROfusion, a consortium that includes 4,800 experts, students and staff from across Europe, carried out the project in partnership with the UK Atomic Energy Authority. The European Commission also contributed funding.The potential for fusion energy is enormous. The experiment used the elements deuterium and tritium -- which are isotopes of hydrogen -- to fuel the fusion. Those elements are likely to be used in commercial-scale fusion, and can be found in seawater.\"The energy you can get out of the fuel deuterium and tritium is massive. For example, powering the whole of current UK electrical demand for a day would require 0.5 tonnes of deuterium, which could be extracted from seawater -- where its concentration is low but plentiful,\" Tony Roulstone from the University of Cambridge's Department of Engineering told CNN.He said the fusion generated by the tokamak -- called the Joint European Torus (JET) -- was around the same as a wind turbine, and could power one house's energy for a day.A view of Torus Hall, where the JET tokamak machine lies.\"But if generated repeatedly, it could power thousands of houses.\"Experts say the results prove that nuclear fusion is possible, and no longer a pipedream solution for the climate crisis. \"These landmark results have taken us a huge step closer to conquering one of the biggest scientific and engineering challenges of them all,\" said Ian Chapman, CEO of the UK Atomic Energy Authority. Mark Wenman, a nuclear materials researcher at Imperial College London, said in a statement that the experiment's results are \"exciting,\" and that they show \"fusion energy really is no longer just a dream of the far future -- the engineering to make it a useful, clean power source is achievable and happening now.\"JET has been subject to such extreme heat and pressure that this experiment is likely the last it will cope with.But its results are seen as a huge boon for ITER, a fusion megaproject in the south of France supported by the US, China, the European Union, India, Japan, Korea and Russia. The ITER project is 80% built and aims to begin nuclear fusion sometime in 2025-26.While JET's goal was to prove that nuclear fusion could be generated and sustained, ITER's aim is to produce a tenfold return on energy, or 500 MW of fusion power from 50 MW of energy put in. Nuclear energy scares people. The climate crisis is giving it another chanceThe results are promising, but mastering nuclear fusion as an everyday energy source is still likely a long way off.\"The JET results are impressive and probably will get better as they proceed through their experiments. They are producing high power 12 MW, but right now just for five seconds. Much longer fusion burn is what is required,\" Roulstone said. The most recent report from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on the latest science shows that the world must nearly halve its greenhouse gas emissions this decade and reach zero net emissions by 2050 to keep global warming in check. That means making a rapid transition away from fossil fuels, like coal, oil and gas. Those actions are required to have any hope of containing warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, seen as a threshold to substantially worsening climate impacts, according to the IPCC.This story has been updated with additional information.",

The waves are also spreading the home wreckage along the Outer Banks shoreline, according to the National Park Service.This isn't the first Rodanthe home the Atlantic Ocean has claimed, according to local media. In 2012, a beach house damaged by Hurricane Sandy also collapsed into the ocean; another home washed away in 2020, leaving a trail of debris along the shore. The home collapsed onto the beach in Rodanthe, North Carolina.The National Park Service also said in 2020 it was planning to relocate the Long Point Cabins in Cape Lookout National Seashore, which is south of Rodanthe, because more frequently they were being overwhelmed by high tides and hurricane storm surge.A giant donut-shaped machine just proved a near-limitless clean power source is possible\"The NPS cannot sustain the Long Point Cabins where they are right now,\" the Park Service wrote on Facebook at the time. \"20 years ago, there was over 300' of beach and dunes between the cabins and high tide. Today, there is 48' of flat sand.\"Read MoreBecause of the home collapse and the associated debris, Park Service officials warned visitors to Cape Hatteras, which includes Rodanthe, to use caution when walking along the beach or engaging in any recreational activities along the shores between the villages of Rodanthe and Salvo. The Park Service said rangers are working with county officials to clean up the debris as well as remove the remnants of the home.\"The bulk of the debris is at the site of the collapsed house, located at 24183 Ocean Drive, Rodanthe,\" Cape Hatteras National Seashore said on a Facebook post. \"However, smaller amounts of debris have been spotted as far south as off-road vehicle ramp 23, more than seven miles away.\"The five-bedroom beach cottage was built in 1980, according to real estate records, and was listed as a vacation rental home, with a market value of $328,900.Rising tidesWhile authorities have not determined the precise cause of the latest collapse in Rodanthe, scientists have showed the increasing risk coastal communities face due to sea level rise, worsening erosion and high-tide flooding. Coastal communities in the Northeast have seen a significant uptick in tidal flooding, including around Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis, Maryland. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has noted that by 2030, there will be 7 to 15 days of high-tide flooding nationally. By 2050, the frequency increases to 25 to 75 days. The five-bedroom cottage was listed as a vacation rental home.More broadly, a 2020 study found that as many as half of all sandy beaches around the world could disappear by the end of the century because of sea level rise. Even by 2050, scientists say, many coastlines could be unrecognizable compared to what people see today, with 14-15% facing severe erosion.Ice that took roughly 2,000 years to form on Mt. Everest has melted in around 25Sea level in this part of coastal North Carolina has risen roughly 3 inches since the early 1980s, according to NASA. Coastal erosion costs around half a billion dollars each year in the form of deteriorated structures and land that is lost to the rising ocean.Many coastal communities in the United States experience nuisance flooding, or high-tide flooding, on a regular basis. Higher sea levels, caused by warmer water temperatures and melting glaciers and ice sheets, increase the hazards coastal homeowners are exposed to. Hurricane storm surge is creeping higher, and homes and other critical infrastructure are now exposed to saltwater and erosion that they weren't a few decades ago.The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has concluded that risks associated with climate change-induced sea level rise will increase significantly along all low-lying coastal communities unless meaningful and major adaptation efforts are made. An update on that report, set to be released later this month, is expected to emphasize those projections and also show how the climate crisis is already impacting coastal communities.",

But Beijing's Big Air Shougang Olympic venue is drawing attention for its much edgier, urban setting.Behind the skiers launching themselves off the 60-meter-high (196-foot) ramp are furnaces, tall chimney stacks and cooling towers on the site of a former steel mill that for decades contributed to the Chinese capital's notoriously polluted skies. The mill, founded in 1919, ceased operations more than 15 years ago, as part of efforts to clear the air in the capital ahead of the 2008 Summer Olympics.That left a large stretch of prime city center land, ripe for rehabilitation and regeneration, says engineering and design company ARUP, which transformed the site into a bustling hub for tourism and art exhibitions, in 2013 it even played host to an electronic music festival.A view of the big air slope for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics at Shougang Industrial Park.

One of the cooling towers even bears the logo for the Games. Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics: Top 15 athletes to watchThe jump has captured the attention of social media users, in part for the mountains of fake snow generated to host the event, but also due to intrigue over what these towers are and why they're still standing, right behind the jump.Some Twitter users wondered if it might be a nuclear plant.\"The Big Air stadium at the Olympics seems to be right next to the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant,\" a user by the name of @jlove1982 wrote.Another, @LindsayMpls, wrote: \"Feels pretty dystopian to have some kind of nuclear facility as the backdrop for this Big Air skiing event.\"The Shougang Big Air is the world's first permanent big air venue for long-term usage. It sits on the bank of the Qunming Lake, on the west side of the cooling towers at 88 meters (288 feet) above sea level, according to architecture firm TeamMinus, which designed the jump.TeamMinus outlined the inspiration behind its design on its website, citing the influence of Chinese flying apsaras, celestial beings which appear in both Buddhist and Hindu cultures.

New Zealand's Finn Bilous competes during the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games at the Big Air Shougang.The Beijing government calls the site a \"Green and Eco Demonstration Area,\" according to ARUP, that could be scaled up in other parts of the country. While the regeneration project is a good example of how to repurpose aging infrastructure, the mill's closure was not necessarily a \"green\" decision, as operations -- and the greenhouse gas emissions associated with steelmaking -- were in actual fact moved to another part of the country.Panda-monium: From medal podiums to spectator stands, Winter Olympics mascot Bing Dwen Dwen is everywhereIn 2005, the entire production plant, which is owned and operated by state-owned steel company the Shougang Group, relocated to Caofeidian, in the adjoining Hebei Province, according to ARUP. The decision to move the plant was part of the Beijing government's economic restructuring and pollution control initiatives. China is the world's biggest emitter of the greenhouse gases fueling the climate crisis, producing more than a quarter of the world's annual emissions.The Big Air is not the first element of the Beijing games to raise questions about the games' environmental credentials. The artificial snow being generated for the Games is made using large quantities of water and electricity.A recent CNN report also showed how the Yanqing venue was built in the former core area of the Songshan National Nature Reserve, a park founded in 1985 to protect its dense forests, alpine meadows and rich biodiversity.JUST WATCHEDWhy Beijing's pledge for green Olympics may be hypocritical ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhy Beijing's pledge for green Olympics may be hypocritical  05:27The Beijing Organizing Committee did not respond to CNN's request for comment over whether it was aware the ski center was built inside the former core area of the nature reserve.

        "content": "(CNN)The late-afternoon sun shone down on a sandstone ridge in Montana, illuminating a large sinkhole that had been soaked from rain showers earlier in the day. Commercial paleontologist Craig Pfister said he spotted parts of a pelvis and femur bones glinting in the light while he was meandering on private land.Little did Pfister know that he had stumbled across one of the most complete skeletons of the mighty Triceratops. \"At that time, I suspected or hoped it was something special, but it took another month of excavation before I knew the extent and quality of the specimen,\" he said. It's called Horridus, a name given to the specimen by its new owner Museums Victoria, Australia's largest public museum organization. The nickname is derived from its full name Triceratops horridus, and it lived 67 million years ago.A new armored dinosaur species from the early Jurassic period was discovered in ChinaPfister is the owner of Great Plains Paleontology, a company based in Madison, Wisconsin, that scouts for and digs up fossils. Over his nearly 30-year career, he's discovered multiple Tyrannosaurus rex specimens along with other rare dinosaurs, but Horridus remains one of his all-time favorites, he said.Read MoreAfter finding the dinosaur remains in 2014, Pfister took more than a year to excavate the bones with a couple of his colleagues. That's understandable, considering the Triceratops left more than 266 bones for the paleontologist to unearth. The skeleton made the long trek from North America in eight special crates to reach its new home at the Melbourne Museum. A fearsome herbivoreErich Fitzgerald helped curate Horridus the Triceratops' exhibit at the Melbourne Museum.These bones make up the most complete dinosaur remains at any Australian museum, according to Erich Fitzgerald, senior curator of vertebrate paleontology at Museums Victoria. Horridus is nearly 85% complete, standing about 2.5 meters (8 feet) tall, 7 meters (23 feet) long and weighing 1,000 kilograms (2,205 pounds), he said. The skull is 98% complete and features three horns along with a majestic frill, the flat bone plate jutting out from the top of the Triceratops' head. The dinosaur may have used its horns to protect itself from predators or to attract potential mates, Fitzgerald said. Not much is known about how the plant-eating dinosaur became so perfectly preserved, but Fitzgerald said he believed the creature would have had to been buried shortly after dying.Sex traps can lure thousands of male giant hornets to their death, study finds  \"I suspect the carcass got washed intact into a river channel, sank quickly to the bottom and then was rapidly covered by sand and mud on the riverbed,\" he said. It could have also died in the water, he added.Paleontologists are rarely able to decipher a dinosaur specimen's sex, so it's not clear if this Horridus was male or female. Unless physicists invent a time machine, it's unlikely humans will be able to answer that question within the century, Fitzgerald said. \"In the meantime, it's these enduring mysteries that continue to spur paleontologists to find out more about our planet's past and ignite wonder in us all,\" he said.Sign up for CNN's Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. How to see HorridusThe Melbourne Museum opened the Triceratops exhibit, called \"Triceratops: Fate of the Dinosaurs,\" this month. It's a permanent part of the museum collection, so visitors don't need to worry about the dinosaur exhibit going away anytime soon, according to Fitzgerald. Its housing in a public museum also allows scientists to engage in scientific research on the skeleton, he said.If a trip to Melbourne isn't on your bucket list, you can examine the bones of a 3D model of Horridus online.",

Cosmonauts Oleg Artemyev, Denis Matveev and Sergey Korsakov lifted off aboard a Soyuz MS-21 spacecraft from the Baikonur Cosmodrome launch pad in Kazakhstan at 11:55 a.m. ET. The crew's launch and trip to the space station, which should take just over three hours, will be streamed live on NASA's website. It's the first spaceflight for Matveev and Korsakov, and the trio will spend the next six and a half months aboard the space station. \n\nThe cosmonauts manually guided the Soyuz through docking with the space station and successfully docked at 3:12 p.m. ET. The hatch opened at 5:48 p.m. ET and they were welcomed aboard the ISS by two Russian cosmonauts, four NASA astronauts and one European Space Agency astronaut. The crew were all smiles and embraced one another after floating through the hatch.This brings the station's crew count to 10. Read MoreTypically, Russian Soyuz launches include two cosmonauts and at least one NASA astronaut or another international partner due to a crew swap agreement between Russian space agency Roscosmos and other agencies. It's not the first time an all-Russian mission has occurred -- a Russian crew flew to the station in October to film the first movie in space.Russian crew wraps trailblazing movie in space, safely returns to EarthAlthough this cosmonaut launch occurs at a time when geopolitical tensions are mounting, the absence of other nations' involvement is coincidental and based on a prior agreement between NASA and Roscosmos to a delayed crew swap for future missions in 2022.\"We still plan to work the crew swap,\" said Joel Montalbano, the manager of NASA's International Space Station program, during a press conference Monday. \"And so we still have scheduled training for Rocosmos to come to Houston, Hawthorne and our team to go over to Star City and train for the Soyuz. \"As far as interactions with the White House -- they are aware that we're continuing these operations. We get questions from time to time, and we answered them, but today we're continuing to work those agreements.\"Cosmonauts lift off aboard a Soyuz MS-21 spacecraft from the Baikonur Cosmodrome launchpad in Kazakhstan.Montalbano did not respond to a question about extending the ISS partnership with Russia to 2030.When asked whether the current tensions on Earth have translated to the crew aboard the space station, Montalbano said, \"When you're in space, there's no borders. You don't see you don't see country lines or state lines.\" \"The teams continue to work together. Are they aware of what's going on Earth? Absolutely. Astronauts and cosmonauts are some of the most professional groups you'll ever see. They continue to operate well, and there's really no tension with the team. This is what they've been trained to do and they're up there doing that job.\"Returning to EarthOn March 30, NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei is set to return to Earth alongside Russian cosmonauts Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov.Vande Hei -- who launched to the ISS in April 2021 -- surpassed NASA astronaut Scott Kelly's record of 340 days in space on March 15, and when he lands in Kazakhstan, he will have set a new record for the amount of time a human has spent in space: 355 days. The space agency sought to reaffirm Monday that it's still working closely with Russian space agency Rocosmos on the International Space Station, despite mounting geopolitical tensions.Joint operations between NASA and Roscosmos at the Russian facilities at Baikonur, Kazakhstan, \"continue to go well,\" according to Montalbano. \"I can tell you for sure Mark [Vande Hei] is coming home\" on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft, Montalbano said Monday. \"We are in communication with our Russian colleagues, there's no fuzz on that.\"NASA says American aboard International Space Station will come back on Russian rocket 'for sure'NASA officials did not say there would be any significant changes to plans to get Vande Hei back to the United States after he lands. He'll travel home via a Gulfstream jet, as other US astronauts have before him.For nearly a decade, Russia's Soyuz vehicles had been the only means of getting astronauts to and from the space station. But that reliance ended after SpaceX debuted its Crew Dragon capsule in 2020, and the US regained human spaceflight capabilities.When Montalbano was asked by CNN's Kristin Fisher about whether NASA has contingency plans in place if the US-Russia relationship further deteriorates, he said: \"The International Space Station, I'll tell you, it's been the flagship model for international cooperation. We talked earlier (about) the interdependency that we have between the US and the Russian segment. That is why we are able to operate and how we're operating...At this time there's no indication from our Russian partners that they want to do anything different. So we are planning to continue operations as we are today.\"",

(CNN)The Artemis I mission is another step closer to its lunar launch. The massive 322-foot-tall (98 meters) stack, which includes NASA's Space Launch System rocket topped by the Orion spacecraft, rolled out for its testing debut at Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Thursday.The integrated stack, which sits on a mobile launcher, began its slow-moving crawl into launch position Thursday afternoon. The rollout officially began at 5:47 p.m. ET.The NASA Artemis I stack, including the SLS rocket (right) topped with the Orion spacecraft, leaves the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center in Florida on March 17.The 4-mile (6.4-kilometer) ride aboard one of the Apollo-era giant NASA crawlers from the assembly building to the launchpad took almost 11 hours. The stack arrived at the pad at 4:15 a.m. ET on Friday.As the stack emerged on Thursday, it became the first moon-bound rocket to leave the building since Apollo 17 in 1972, or 50 years ago -- also the last time anyone set foot on the moon.\ud83d\ude2e \ud83e\udd2f pic.twitter.com/woEq6oLhvn\u2014 NASA's Exploration Ground Systems (@NASAGroundSys) March 17, 2022\nRead More\"Every single vehicle that has carried humans beyond the bounds of low-Earth orbit has undergone integration and testing in that Vehicle Assembly Building, crawled down this roadway and launched right here from the Kennedy Space Center,\" said Janet Petro, director for Kennedy Space Center, as the rollout began on Thursday.Together, the rocket and spacecraft stand just taller than the Statue of Liberty. The Artemis I rocket stack completed a nearly 11-hour journey to the launchpad on Friday morning.\"Rolling out of the (Vehicle Assembly Building) is really an iconic moment for this vehicle,\" said Tom Whitmeyer, associate administrator for exploration systems development at NASA Headquarters during a Monday press conference. \"Thursday is going to be a day to remember.\"A final testFollowing a couple weeks of tests at the pad, the vehicle will be ready for its wet dress rehearsal the weekend of April 1 -- the final test before launching the first uncrewed Artemis mission beyond the moon and back to Earth. NASA is collecting names to be put on a flash drive and sent into space on the Orion spacecraft. The wet dress rehearsal includes running through the full set of operations to load propellant into the fuel tanks and a launch countdown -- basically everything necessary for a launch without actually launching. During the hours of prep leading up to the wet dress rehearsal, more than 700,000 gallons of cryogenic propellants will be loaded into the rocket If the test is successful, the stack will go back into the assembly building until it's ready to launch. NASA will send your name around the moon. Here's how to sign up\"Artemis I is such an important mission for us,\" said Howard Hu, manager of the Orion program at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, during the Monday press conference. \"It's gathering very critical engineering data and validating our performance capability as spacecraft for our next mission and beyond -- Artemis 2 with the crew and future missions as we go further and expand our capabilities in the solar system.\" The Artemis program has experienced a multitude of delays. The mission was originally scheduled to launch in November 2021, but the pandemic, storms like Hurricane Ida and other factors have drawn out the mission time line. Artemis I is the first step of NASA's ambitious program to land the first woman and the first person of color on the moon later in the 2020s. It's all in preparation to establish a long-term lunar presence and to prepare for exploring Mars. Depending on the results of the wet dress rehearsal, the uncrewed mission could launch in May, June or July.Kennedy Space Center employees and their families gathered to watch the NASA Artemis rocket stack move.During the flight, the uncrewed Orion spacecraft will launch atop the SLS rocket to reach the moon and travel thousands of miles beyond it -- farther than any spacecraft intended to carry humans has ever traveled. This mission is expected to last for a few weeks and will end with Orion splashing down in the Pacific Ocean.Artemis I will be the final proving ground for Orion before the spacecraft carries astronauts to the moon, 1,000 times farther from Earth than where the space station is located, said Cathy Koerner, former Orion program manager, in October. Koerner is now NASA's deputy associate administrator for exploration systems development.After the uncrewed Artemis I flight, Artemis II will be a crewed flyby of the moon and Artemis III will return astronauts to the lunar surface. The time line for the subsequent mission launches depends on the results of the Artemis I mission.\"There's no doubt that we are in a golden era of human space exploration, discovery and ingenuity in space, and it all begins with Artemis, I,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson during the rollout.\"The Space Launch System is the only rocket capable of sending humans into deep space. It's the most powerful rocket in the world. Orion will venture farther than any spacecraft built for humans. And after a three-week journey of over a million miles, Orion will come home faster and hotter than any vehicle has before.\"NASA astronaut Victor Glover Jr. was also at the rollout and reflected on the importance of the Artemis program.\"This is our rocket, it's humanity's rocket,\" Glover said. \"When those four RS-25 (engines) and two solid (rocket boosters) light, I hope the whole world is watching. And I hope a lot of kids decide to study science and math because of it. And that's really what it's about, inspiring kids to go out and be their best selves.\"An iconic crawlArtemis I rode on top of Crawler-transporter 2 for its trip to the launchpad, just like the shuttle missions and Apollo Saturn V rockets once did.Crawler-transporter 2 was used to move the mega rocket stack to the launchpad.The 6.6 million-pound (3 million-kilogram) crawler carried the towering rocket stack and its mobile launcher at a top speed of 1 mile per hour (1.6 kilometers per hour).The iconic crawler is one of two that have operated for more than 50 years at Kennedy Space Center. They were first operated in 1965 and can each transport 18 million pounds (8.2 million kilograms), or the weight of more than 20 fully loaded 777 airplanes, according to NASA. They are so wide that a professional baseball diamond could sit on top of each crawler.\"It's gonna be amazing,\" said Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, Artemis launch director for NASA's Exploration Ground Systems program at Kennedy Space Center on Monday. \"She has been in operation for 50 plus years and underwent significant upgrades as part of getting ready for this vehicle and for Artemis operations.\"After upgrades, Crawler-transporter 2 should be able to keep hauling massive rockets to the launch pad for years to come.",

Research on the specimens began in 2019, according to study author Shundong Bi, professor at Indiana University of Pennsylvania.Holes the size of city blocks are forming in the Arctic seafloor The ancient creature belongs to the thyreophoran group, the same as its distant cousin the Stegosaurus, said study author Paul Barrett, merit researcher at the Natural History Museum in London. It likely lived 192 million to 174 million years ago and is the first thyreophoran from that time period to be recognized in the region, according to the study. \"This is the first early armoured dinosaur to be named from the entire Asian continent and helps to show how the group spread around the world shortly after its origin just a few million years earlier,\" Barrett said via email.

The dinosaur's heavy build and distinctive armor hinted that the researchers had a new species on their hands, Bi said. Additionally, the findings show how diverse the group of dinosaurs was and how rapidly they spread across the northern hemisphere, he said.The armored dinosaur's closest relatives are the herbivorous Scelidosaurus and the Emausaurus -- both of which originated in Europe during the Jurassic period, Barrett said.",

The March full moon, known as the worm moon, will be at its peak at 3:18 a.m. ET on Friday, March 18, according to NASA. It will appear full through Saturday morning. This moon will appear larger to viewers because of the \"moon illusion,\" according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. This occurs when the moon is near the horizon and our eyes compare the moon's size to trees, buildings or other earthly objects. By comparing these reference points to the moon, our brain tricks us into thinking the moon is bigger.Equinox Fast FactsSouthern Native American tribes named the worm moon after the earthworm casts -- essentially feces -- that emerged as the ground thawed at winter's end, according to NASA.Another account in the Old Farmer's Almanac says that the name refers to beetle larvae that would come out of winter hideouts as spring arrived. Read MoreNorthern Native American tribes, however, lived among forests without native earthworms due to glaciers having wiped out the species, according to NASA. Some of these groups instead referred to the moon as the crow moon, as a nod to the birds whose cawing would signal the end of winter. NASA astronauts conduct spacewalk to provide space station power upgradesIn the Hindu month Phalguna, the March full moon marks the beginning of the Holi Festival, a two-day celebration known as the \"Festival of Love,\" \"Festival of Colors\" and \"Festival of Spring,\" according to NASA. There are nine full moons left in 2022, with two of them qualifying as supermoons. Here is a list of the remaining moons for 2022, according to the Farmers' Almanac:April 16: Pink moonMay 16: Flower moonJune 14: Strawberry moonJuly 13: Buck moonAugust 11: Sturgeon moonSeptember 10: Harvest moonOctober 9: Hunter's moonNovember 8: Beaver moonDecember 7: Cold moonWhile these are the popularized names associated with the monthly full moons, the significance of each one may vary across Native American tribes.Lunar and solar eclipsesThere will be two total lunar eclipses and two partial solar eclipses in 2022, according to The Old Farmer's Almanac.Partial solar eclipses occur when the moon passes in front of the sun but only blocks some of its light. Be sure to wear proper eclipse glasses to safely view solar eclipses, as the sun's light can be damaging to the eye.A partial solar eclipse on April 30 can be seen by those in southern South America, the southeastern Pacific Ocean and the Antarctic peninsula. Another one on October 25 will be visible to those in Greenland, Iceland, Europe, northeastern Africa, the Middle East, western Asia, India and western China. Neither of the partial solar eclipses will be visible from North America.'Tiny' asteroid strikes Earth testing early warning system A lunar eclipse can occur only during a full moon when the sun, Earth and moon align, and the moon passes into Earth's shadow. Earth casts two shadows on the moon during the eclipse. The penumbra is the partial outer shadow, and the umbra is the full, dark shadow.When the full moon moves into Earth's shadow, it darkens, but it won't disappear. Sunlight passing through Earth's atmosphere lights the moon in a dramatic fashion, turning it red -- which is why this is often referred to as a \"blood moon.\"Depending on the weather conditions in your area, it may be rusty, brick-colored or blood red.Capturing the heritage of the International Space Station before it crashes into the oceanThis happens because blue light undergoes stronger atmospheric scattering, so red light will be the most dominant color highlighted as sunlight passes through our atmosphere and casts it on the moon.A total lunar eclipse will be visible to those in Europe, Africa, South America and North America (excepting northwestern regions) between 9:31 p.m. ET on May 15 and 2:52 a.m. ET on May 16.Another total lunar eclipse will also be on display for those in Asia, Australia, the Pacific, South America and North America on November 8 between 3:01 a.m. ET and 8:58 a.m. ET -- but the moon will be setting for those in eastern regions of North America.Meteor showersThis year kicked off with the Quadrantid meteor shower in January, but the next meteor shower won't peak until April.Here are the remaining 11 showers to watch for in 2022:\u2022 Lyrids: April 21-22\u2022 Eta Aquariids: May 4-5\u2022 Southern delta Aquariids: July 29-30\u2022 Alpha Capricornids: July 30-31\u2022 Perseids: August 11-12\u2022 Orionids: October 20-21\u2022 Southern Taurids: November 4-5\u2022 Northern Taurids: November 11-12\u2022 Leonids: November 17-18\u2022 Geminids: December 13-14\u2022 Ursids: December 21-22If you live in an urban area, you may want to drive to a place that isn't littered with city lights that will obstruct your view.Find an open area with a wide view of the sky. Make sure you have a chair or blanket so you can look straight up. And give your eyes about 20 to 30 minutes -- without looking at your phone or other electronics -- to adjust to the darkness so the meteors will be easier to spot.",

        "content": "(CNN)An everyday item in your kitchen is a better home for many diverse types of bacteria than a petri dish in a laboratory, new research revealed.A common sponge's spatial partitioning -- the way it's divided into different sectors of various sizes -- caters to bacteria that prefer isolated environments and those that prefer to be around other organisms, making it the best of both worlds for microbial communities, according to a study published recently in the journal Nature Chemical Biology. Bacteria that thrive in secluded spaces, like the smaller pores of a sponge, won't \"bully\" other organisms for room, while the sponge's bigger wells allow for microbes that depend on the presence of others to survive.\"It's just like we are going to parties and there are individuals who will really enjoy having huge room interactions with a lot of people, and it will draw energy from that,\" said the study's senior author Lingchong You, professor of biomedical engineering at Duke University in North Carolina. \"But there are also individuals who feel like they want to be in a smaller environment.\"Researchers tracked bacteria growth by marking them different colors. While the results may help you better understand why your kitchen sponge is habitat central for germs, the aim of this research is to find a means to engineer diverse microbial communities that produce chemicals of medicinal or biotechnological value, You said. Home sweet homeRead MoreTo arrive at these results, researchers tested E. coli density and presence in two different ways. They used plates with varying degrees of spatial partitioning, ranging from six to 1,536 isolated wells. The plates showed that the amount of division in spaces has an impact on what type of bacteria tend to thrive the most.Researchers then performed another experiment with a kitchen sponge and a tube. The results revealed that in a sponge, there are \"60% more diverse members than in a well-mixed environment,\" You said, referencing the compacted habitat bacteria are in when placed inside a tube. \"The degree of this spatial partitioning plays a critical role in maintaining the microbial community diversity,\" You said. \"And it could be that the optimal degree of partitioning also depends on the nature of interactions in a particular community (of bacteria).\"The germiest place in your home and the best way to combat those microbesOverall, what they found was that environments that can provide a mix of large chambers and small wells allow for the most diverse microbial communities.Because sponges are a \"perfect growth environment for microbes,\" You recommended that consumers be \"mindful\" and replace their sponges on a periodic basis or find a way to disinfect them. It is recommended sponges be replaced on a weekly basis, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Scientific Reports. To sterilize bacteria on sponges, the United States Department of Agriculture suggests consumers use microwave heating and dishwashing with a drying cycle.The results provide an understanding of the microbial point of view where \"distances and spaces are dramatically different\" from a human's point of view, said Slava Epstein, a professor of microbiology at Northeastern University, who was not involved with the study. By studying the distance between cells, which is measured in microns, researchers are better able to understand how the importance of scale impacts microbial interactions, Epstein said. Sign up for CNN's Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. Microbial communities in natureEpstein added that a \"natural extension\" of this research would be to examine the role of spatial partitioning in nature, such as how bacteria work in soil, since the bacteria used in the study were grown artificially and controlled by researchers.Bacteria are able to find both isolated and shared enviornments in sponges. \"Working with well plates clearly indicates a very significant role in the size of compartments they can grow and whether or not there is a separation between such compartments,\" Epstein said. \"Once we know this, it gives you ammunition and drive to go after actual natural communities.\"Although the study cannot prove quite yet how spatial partitioning affects microbial communities in nature, You said he is optimistic overall that the results should remain consistent. Researchers are interested in experimenting with natural microbial communities, but You said these bacteria need to learn how to live with each other first. \"One member will control one step of the pathway, another member will control another step of the pathway,\" You said. \"But in order for this to work, they will need to co-exist, so we need to maintain their diversity, and then we're using this partitioned environment, precisely to help maintain different members.\"",

(CNN)The James Webb Space Telescope has taken one giant step closer in its mission to unlock the mysteries of the universe. The world's premier space observatory has successfully completed a number of steps crucial for aligning its 18 gold mirror segments. Having checked this milestone off of Webb's list, the telescope team expects that the observatory may even exceed the goals it was meant to achieve. Webb will be able to peer inside the atmospheres of exoplanets and observe some of the first galaxies created after the universe began by observing them through infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye.On March 11, Webb completed \"fine phasing,\" a critical stage that ensures Webb's optical capabilities are working how they should. During the tests, the team didn't encounter any issues and determined that Webb can observe light from distant objects and feed that light into the science instruments aboard the observatory.For the test, Webb focused on a star called 2MASS J17554042+6551277. A red filter was used to show contrast. Webb's observational capabilities are so sensitive that individual galaxies and stars can also be seen behind the star in the image.Read MoreThis $10 billion space telescope will reveal the secrets of the universe\"The images are focused together as finely as the laws of physics allow,\" said Marshall Perrin, Webb deputy telescope scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. \"But as we were focusing on those bright stars, we couldn't help but see the rest of the universe coming into focus behind them, to see the more distant stars and galaxies coming into view.\"While the first high-resolution images Webb collects of the cosmos aren't expected until the end of June, the new test images released by NASA on Wednesday show that Webb can use the individual segments of its mirror as one giant 21-foot, 4-inch (6.5-meter) mirror and capture the light from a single star.Galaxies and stars can be seen behind the star 2MASS J17554042+6551277 in this image captured by the James Webb Space Telescope. \"The engineering images that we saw today are as sharp and as crisp as the images that Hubble can take, but are at a wavelength of light that is totally invisible to humans, so this is making the invisible universe snapping into very, very sharp focus,\" said Jane Rigby, Webb operations project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.The mirror is so large that it had to be folded to fit inside the rocket for its December 25 launch. After reaching an orbit a million miles from Earth in January, Webb began the careful process of unfolding and aligning its mirror. Webb telescope's first test images include an unexpected 'selfie'\"More than 20 years ago, the Webb team set out to build the most powerful telescope that anyone has ever put in space and came up with an audacious optical design to meet demanding science goals,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. \"Today we can say that design is going to deliver.\"Although the process is ongoing, the team is encouraged to see Webb performing even better than expected. Now that the fine phasing stage is complete, the Near-Infrared Camera, which serves as the telescope's primary imager, is aligned to the mirror.This new \"selfie\" shows all of Webb's 18 primary mirror segments collecting light from the same star.Webb also captured a new \"selfie\" using a lens focused on capturing images of the actual mirror segments. The selfie shows the alignment of the mirror segments as they capture starlight in unison.The completion of fine phasing, and all of the critical steps before it, also brings a sigh of relief for the team.\"All of the sleepless nights I've had and the worries I've had, they're all behind us now,\" Zurbuchen said. \"There's still a mountain to climb, but we're way up that mountain now.\"For the next couple of months, the team will finish the last steps of the alignment process and ensure all of the science instruments are calibrated.\"We're exactly where we thought we'd be at this point about three months after launch and that sets us up to be on track for completing the rest of the commissioning within the six months after launch and turning over to science starting this summer,\" Perrin said.Once Webb is fully operational, it will \"move into a very demanding year of science operations,\" Rigby said.",

        "content": "(CNN)Eugene Parker, an astrophysicist who pioneered the solar research field of heliophysics, has died at age 94. Parker died Tuesday, according to the University of Chicago, where he joined the faculty in 1955 and eventually became the S. Chandrasekhar Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus.Parker's work revolutionized human understanding of the sun and interplanetary space. In 1958, he proposed the concept of solar wind after realizing the sun had a magnetic field that created a structure in our solar system, populated by plasma and hot particles. He realized that this stream was a flow of gas. \"It hit me that it's a solar wind,\" Parker told CNN in 2018.Astrophysicist Eugene Parker is pictured receiving the public service medal and a model of Parker Solar Probe during a meeting at the William Eckhardt Research Center in Chicago on May 31, 2017. \"We were saddened to learn the news that one of the great scientific minds and leaders of our time has passed,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson in a statement. \"Dr. Eugene Parker's contributions to science and to understanding how our universe works touches so much of what we do here at NASA. Dr. Parker's legacy will live on through the many active and future NASA missions that build upon his work.\"Read MoreOn August 12, 2018, the Parker Solar Probe launched from Florida on a seven-year mission to unlock the mysteries of the sun. It was named in honor of Parker's pioneering work that established heliophysics in the 1950s. This made Parker the first living person to have a spacecraft named after him, and he was present in Cape Canaveral for the launch.The journey to make the mission possible took 60 years. On board the craft is a chip carrying photos of Parker, his groundbreaking 1958 paper on solar wind and more than 1.1 million names submitted by the public. The chip is attached to a card that reads, \"The Parker Solar Probe mission is dedicated to Dr. Eugene N. Parker whose profound contributions have revolutionized our understanding of the sun and solar wind. 'Let's see what lies ahead.' Gene Parker, July 2017.\" \"The field of heliophysics exists in large part because of Dr. Eugene Parker,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's associate administrator for science, in a statement. \"Honoring his work by giving Parker Solar Probe his name is one of the proudest accomplishments of my career. My work, my passion for science, and my drive to keep exploring is strongly influenced by this great man. Parker Solar Probe 'touching the Sun,' is a fitting accomplishment for his namesake mission.\"Parker (center) is seen with NASA Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate Thomas Zurbuchen (left) and President and Chief Executive Officer for United Launch Alliance Tony Bruno in front of  the ULA Delta IV Heavy rocket with NASA's Parker Solar onboard on August 10, 2018.Solar wind is not the only thing credited to Parker. He worked out the dynamics of cosmic rays in the galaxy alongside a few other colleagues, and he discovered the Parker Spiral (the shape of the wind from the sun) and the Parker limit for monopoles, which is about the survival of galactic magnetic fields that places a limit on the flux of magnetic monopoles (the magnetic version of charged particles) in the universe. Parker retired from the University of Chicago in 1995, but remained an active researcher as he continued to publish articles and books. He served as chair of the university's department of astronomy and astrophysics twice and also served as chair of the National Academy of Sciences' astronomy section.Over the course of his lifetime, Parker received the U.S. National Medal of Science, the Kyoto Prize, the Crafoord Prize, the American Physical Society Medal for Exceptional Achievement in Research and its James Clerk Maxwell Prize. He was a fellow of the American Physical Society and a Legacy Fellow of the American Astronomical Society.\"We are devastated by the loss of my father, but we know his legacy spans not only our family and friends, but the international community of scientists around the globe,\" said his son Eric Parker in a statement. \"We extend our gratitude to everyone who has reached out with memories, for his colleagues over the years who worked with him to explore a subject which gave him much joy, and for the many people at NASA and the Applied Physics Laboratory who welcomed my father and gave him a profound gift -- the chance to see the launch of the Parker Solar Probe, which moved him deeply.\"A voyage of curiosityAs a child, Parker lived in Buffalo, New York, two blocks from a railroad yard. The trains fascinated him. His father, an aeronautical engineer at the Consolidated Aircraft Company, would explain things in a way he could understand. Parker Solar Probe detects a radio signal from Venus' atmosphereParker did experiments with \"tin can\" telephones to learn how sound traveled. He inherited a microscope from his grandfather and studied microorganisms. The wonders of the world never ceased for him.But school was a different story, and Parker said he was \"not an enthusiastic student\" -- at least until high school, when he was introduced to algebra, Euclidean geometry and trigonometry. Their simplistic principles, he said, piqued his interest in a way biology or social studies did not. And in his senior year, he was introduced to physics. Parker had the epiphany that physics was the basis for all of his interests over the years, and he quickly realized that he wanted to become a physicist like his grandfather and an uncle, who both worked at Bell Laboratories. Parker pursued a bachelor's degree in physics at Michigan State University and then received his doctorate from the California Institute of Technology in 1951. He began his teaching career at the University of Utah before joining the faculty at the University of Chicago and its Enrico Fermi Institute. Discovering solar windParker wasn't viewed as a pioneer in 1958. Instead, he battled the old guard for his new ideas to be accepted. The then-30-year-old submitted a paper to the Astrophysical Journal for review before publication. In it, he proposed the concept of solar wind.A flow of charged gases from the sun, solar wind is present in most of the solar system. It screams past Earth at a million miles per hour, and can cause disruptive space weather that impacts our planet. Parker is shown at the University of Chicago in 2017.The mathematics to predict solar wind were simple: four lines of algebra. But the two esteemed referees reviewing his paper rejected Parker's \"radical\" idea. There were no errors in his study or his math. The concept, however, conflicted with astronomers belief at the time that the space between planets was a vacuum.Parker went to the editor of the journal, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, an astrophysicist who would be awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize for Physics. Chandrasekhar overruled the referees and agreed to publish the paper.\"Many of his colleagues thought he must be wrong, but when (the probe) Mariner 2 was on the trip to Venus in 1962, it revealed that a supersonic wind was always present,\" said Ed Stone, longtime project scientist for NASA's Voyager mission, who worked across the hall from Parker at the University of Chicago.A lasting legacyParker was humble when he reflected on his legacy -- perhaps because he was surrounded by pioneers of astronomy and astrophysics in the 1950s and 1960s, during the Space Age. He was contemporaries with Nobel laureates Chandrasekhar, Enrico Fermi and Arthur Holly Compton. All of these former University of Chicago professors have posthumously had spacecraft named for them, including the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Fermi Gamma-Ray Telescope and the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. NASA's Parker Solar Probe becomes first spacecraft to 'touch' the sun\"The University and the department has lost one of its giants,\" said Michael Turner, the Bruce V. and Diana M. Rauner Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Chicago, in a statement. \"Gene changed the course of science with his work on magnetic fields literally everywhere in the cosmos, but he remained humble and approachable, with a wry sense of humor. He ranked up there with Stephen Hawking in his ability to express the gist of an issue, scientific or otherwise, in a few clear sentences.\"Parker is pictured his Hyde Park home in 2019.Next month, Parker's family will travel to Sweden to a ceremony celebrating the Crafoord Prize, which he won in 2020. \"Anyone who knew Dr. Parker, knew that he was a visionary,\" said Nicola Fox, director of the Heliophysics Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"I was honored to stand with him at the launch of Parker Solar Probe and have loved getting to share with him all the exciting science results, seeing his face light up with every new image and data plot I showed him. I will sincerely miss his excitement and love for Parker Solar Probe. Even though Dr. Parker is no longer with us, his discoveries and legacy will live forever.\"",

(CNN)The early warning system to detect asteroids that pose a threat to Earth, operated by NASA and its collaborators around the world, got to flex its muscles. It successfully detected a small asteroid 6 1/2 feet (2 meters) wide just hours before it smashed into the atmosphere over the Norwegian Sea before disintegrating on Friday, March 11, according to a statement from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory on Tuesday. That's too small to pose any hazard to Earth, NASA said. A still from an animation showing asteroid 2022 EB5's predicted orbit around the sun before crashing into the Earth's atmosphere on March 11.Often such tiny asteroids slip through the surveillance net, and 2022 EB5 -- as the asteroid was named -- is only the fifth of this kind to be spotted and tracked prior to impact. (Fear not, a larger asteroid would be discovered and tracked much further from Earth -- years ahead of any potential devastating impact.)\"Tiny asteroids like 2022 EB5 are numerous, and they impact into the atmosphere quite frequently -- roughly every 10 months or so,\" said Paul Chodas, the director of  JPL's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies, which tracks potentially hazardous comets and asteroids that could collide with our planet. \"But very few of these asteroids have actually been detected in space and observed extensively prior to impact, basically because they are very faint until the last few hours, and a survey telescope has to observe just the right spot of sky at the right time for one to be detected.\"Read MoreThe asteroid was spotted just two hours before it made impact by astronomer Kriszti\u00e1n Sarneczky at the Piszk\u00e9stet\u0151 Observatory in northern Hungary, who flagged it to the Minor Planet Center's Near-Earth Object Confirmation Page, NASA said. NASA astronauts conduct spacewalk to provide space station power upgrades NASA's \"Scout\" impact hazard assessment system, which automatically searches the Minor Planet Center's database for possible new asteroids or other space objects took these early measurements to calculate the trajectory of 2022 EB5. As soon as the system determined that 2022 EB5 was going to hit Earth's atmosphere, NASA flagged the object on the Scout web page to notify the near-Earth object observing community, which was able to provide more observations.\"Scout had only 14 observations over 40 minutes from one observatory to work with when it first identified the object as an impactor. We were able to determine the possible impact locations, which initially extended from western Greenland to off the coast of Norway,\" said Davide Farnocchia, a navigation engineer at JPL who developed Scout. \"As more observatories tracked the asteroid, our calculations of its trajectory and impact location became more precise.\"Former astronaut to back off Twitter war with head of Russian space agency NASA said \"this real-world event\"  suggested that the \"impact prediction models at CNEOS are highly capable of informing the response to the potential impact of a larger object.\" Asteroids and other near-Earth objects zip past our planet multiple times a week. In September, NASA will deliberately crash a spacecraft into an asteroid to change its motion in space -- testing technology developed to deflect an asteroid hit.Known as the DART mission, or the Double Asteroid Redirection Test, the spacecraft is aiming for Dimorphos, a small moon orbiting the near-Earth asteroid Didymos. Near-Earth objects are asteroids and comets with orbits that place them within 30 million miles (48 million kilometers) of Earth.",

(CNN)Veteran former astronaut Scott Kelly tells CNN he is backing off his high-profile Twitter war with the head of the Russian space agency, following a warning from a NASA official that such attacks are \"damaging\" to the International Space Station mission.The warning came in an email, obtained exclusively by CNN, that was sent to all former US astronauts last week from a current NASA official who urged caution before \"attacking our Russian partners.\"The war in Ukraine has pushed some former NASA astronauts, including Kelly, to speak out against the head of Russia's space agency, and it's putting NASA in a tough spot as it works to preserve its 20-year partnership with the Russians at the International Space Station.\"As Americans, each of us enjoys freedom of speech and you are all empowered to speak your mind,\" the email reads.  \"However, please know that as former NASA astronauts, your words carry additional weight and attacking our Russian partners is damaging to our current mission.\"CNN obtained a copy of the email with the stipulation that the name of the high-ranking NASA official not be revealed. Read MoreOn the same day the email went out, Kelly, one of NASA's most famous former astronauts, was blocked on Twitter by Roscosmos Director General Dmitry Rogozin after Kelly criticized both Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Rogozin's repeated threats to pull out of the International Space Station.  \"Get off, you moron!\" Rogozin said in a quickly deleted Tweet. \"Otherwise, the death of the International Space Station will be on your conscience.\"\"Dimon, why did you delete this tweet?\" Kelly replied via Twitter in Russian. \"Don't want everyone to see what kind of child you are?\"Former NASA astronaut Scott Kelly and Russian space chief engage in Twitter fight Kelly told CNN in an interview last week that he felt compelled to speak out after Rogozin shared a Roscosmos-produced video showing two Russian cosmonauts floating inside the space station and waving goodbye to NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei, who is supposed to return to Earth with them on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft on March 30.  But after receiving the email from the NASA official, Kelly told CNN that he's decided to refrain from engaging in another Twitter fight with Rogozin, something he hinted at in an op-ed on Tuesday.\"Yes, I saw the email and backed off Rogozin. I didn't have to, but I respect NASA, NASA's position and the (official) that sent it,\" Kelly told CNN, though he intends to keep opposing the war in fluent Russian for his more than 5 million Twitter followers. NASA's position is that it wants the International Space Station to continue to be \"the flagship model for international cooperation.\"\"For over 20 years, the International Space Station partnership has operated successfully, and nothing has changed in the last three weeks,\" Joel Montalbano, the manager of NASA's International Space Station program, said at a Monday news conference.  \"We are aware of what's going on, but we are able to do our jobs to continue operations.\" That includes the successful completion of a nearly seven-hour long spacewalk on Tuesday by NASA astronauts Kayla Barron and Raja Chari. While inside the space station, Vande Hei surpassed Kelly's record for the single longest spaceflight by a US astronaut.\"Congratulations!\" Kelly told Vande Hei on Twitter.  \"Broken records indicate progress.  Looking forward to seeing you safely home soon.  Ad astra!\"Vande Hei, who launched to the space station in April 2021, is expected to log a total of 355 days in orbit by the time he returns to Earth on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft and lands in Kazakhstan.  He'll travel home on a Gulfstream jet, as other US astronauts have before him.\"I can tell you, for sure, Mark is coming home on that Soyuz. We are in communication with our Russian colleagues. There's no fuzz on that,\" Montalbano said Monday.NASA says American aboard International Space Station will come back on Russian rocket 'for sure'Despite tensions remaining white hot between the US and Russia on Earth, the International Space Station continues to be a beacon of diplomacy between the teams in mission control and the fliers on board. \"Are they aware of what's going on on Earth? Absolutely,\" Montalbano said.  \"But the astronauts and cosmonauts are some of the most professional groups you'll ever see. They continue to operate well and there's really no tensions with the team. This is what they've been trained to do -- a job -- and they're up there doing that job.\"NASA declined to specifically address the email, but NASA Administrator Bill Nelson acknowledged the \"substantial\" challenges that the agency is currently facing.\"Despite challenges on Earth -- and they are substantial -- NASA is committed to the seven astronauts and cosmonauts on board the International Space Station. NASA continues the working relationship with all our international partners to ensure their safety and the ongoing safe operations of the ISS,\" Nelson said.",

(CNN)Watch out giant hornets, your next mating could be your last. Researchers found that giant hornets can be lured into traps using sex pheromones, according to a new study published in the journal Current Biology. Honeybees make a chilling warning noise when attacked by hive-destroying murder hornets The hornets, Vespa mandarinia, are an invasive species in North America and are originally from Asia. While Asian bees have adapted to protect themselves from the predatory hornets, North American bees have not. Giant hornets have wreaked havoc on the bee population in the United States. It's estimated the giant hornets -- the largest in the world -- harm over $100 million of bee-pollinated crops production annually. Many people often refer to them as \"murder hornets,\" but it's a sensational name that should be avoided, said study author James Nieh, professor and associate dean in the department of biological sciences at the University of California San Diego. Read More\"They are predators, but so are lions and tigers, and we don't call them murder lions,\" he said.Trapping the invasive insectsNieh's team created a series of traps using sex pheromones to attract male hornets. Pheromones are chemicals that are produced to convey information within a species, according to Nieh.Male hornets are attracted to the female hornet's sex pheromone, so researchers used their own mixtures of synthetic pheromones along with a natural sex pheromone from a female Vespa mandarinia to test which traps would perform the best.Each trap was outfitted with a dummy female hornet to attract the males as well, Nieh said. Rare wolverine sighting in Yellowstone was captured on video\"Hornets would be attracted and fly around the traps, but none of them would land if there was nothing there that looked like a female hornet,\" he explained.After setting them up near hornet colonies in China's Yunnan province, the researchers found that the queen-equivalent pheromone was the most successful. It's made of hexanoic acid, octanoic acid and decanoic acid, the study said.The winning trap captured more than 16 times more hornets than a trap without pheromones, according to the study. After leaving the traps out for a day, the scientists were able to capture thousands of hornets, Nieh said. Stopping the hornets in their tracksResearchers used materials similar to a sticky mouse trap, making it easy for other scientists to re-create them and use them on hornets around North America, Nieh said. Newly discovered rainbow-colored fish lives in the ocean's 'twilight zone'The chemicals can also be easily purchased at chemical suppliers in the United States, which makes it even easier to implement this trapping method, he added.While it's an effective method to capture a large number of giant hornets in a short period of time, it may not be an ideal system, said Allen Gibbs, a professor in the department of life sciences at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who was not involved in the study. \"This method attracts males, but if they've already mated, the females are free to fly off and start a new colony,\" he said. Additionally, the hornets only mate for a few months in the fall, so the trapping method could only be implemented during that time, Gibbs noted.",
