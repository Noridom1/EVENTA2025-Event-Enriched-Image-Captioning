        "content": "London (CNN Business)The battle to elbow rivals away and get to the front of the bar is a proud weekend tradition stretching back generations \u2014 but it causes headaches for bar staff trying to work out who has been waiting the longest. Now, British developers behind a new \"AI bar\" are promising to consign shouts of \"who's next\" to history, with the help of facial recognition.The new system will use a webcam to film arrivals at the bar, feeding back the order of a virtual line to bartenders via a display screen behind the counter.It means that, in theory, customers may never have to stare down a line-jumper who gets their order as soon as they've muscled their way to the front. It also means bar staff won't have to navigate a frustrated crowd. The AI bar will help bartenders sort out who's next for a pint.The technology was tested in June at a bar in central London, and will be trialed at more establishments starting in September.Read MoreIt will alert customers to their place in the line, and will also scan their faces to analyze their age, with the aim of reducing the time it takes to ask for identification.DataSparQ, the company behind the system, says it carried out research that revealed British people spend about two months of their life waiting at bars. \"Queuing is a part of British life that we all have to endure \u2014 but we wanted to do something to improve the experience,\" John Wyllie, managing director at DataSparQ, said in a statement.WeWork to limit free beer all-day perk to four glasses\"It's the uncertainty of waiting times alongside queue jumpers that's adversely affecting consumer behaviours in bars and pubs,\" he added. The company is in talks with pubs around the United Kingdom with a view to rolling out the software. The software will cost pub landlords \u00a3199 ($240) per month.The company also hopes the technology can serve a wider purpose \u2014 slowing down the punishing decline of pubs across Britain. Fourteen pubs close each week in the country, according to the Campaign for Real Ale.DataSparQ said its technology will provide landlords with data about when a pub is getting more orders, allowing them to adjust staffing and other costs accordingly.",

        "content": "Like thousands of others, Megha Mathur moved to the Indian city of Gurgaon for a coveted job in tech. She soon realized she wouldn't be able to live there very long. The pollution was so bad she had to check an air quality app on her phone several times a day to see whether it was safe to go outside without a mask. \"Having to live like that can cause a lot of anxiety and stress in knowing that's constantly your life,\" Mathur, 27, told CNN Business. \"Even though there are exciting opportunities in terms of companies and jobs, it just wasn't a place that I could see myself living long term and I think a lot of people share that opinion.\"Gurgaon, around 25 miles from India's capital New Delhi, is one of the country's newest tech hubs \u2014 home to global players such as Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) as well as some of India's biggest startups like food delivery firm Zomato and India's biggest hotel chain OYO. Mathur, who worked for Zomato, stayed there only nine months before moving with her fianc\u00e9e Harshvardhan Singh to the southern city of Bangalore.     \"If you want to work in tech then Bangalore is your number one choice,\" says Singh, who left OYO for Flipkart, India's top online retailer that was bought by Walmart (WMT) last year. Often described as India's Silicon Valley, the city is also the main India base for Amazon (AMZN), Flipkart's main rival, the birthplace of ride-hailing firm Ola and home to leading outsourcing companies such as Infosys (INFY) and Wipro (WIT). Gurgaon and Bangalore have exploded in the past two decades as the main centers of India's tech boom, with millions like Mathur and Singh taking up the highly prized and well paid jobs that come with it. The cities underscore one of the main dilemmas the country faces: The rapid growth needed to drive its $3 trillion economy and sustain 1.3 billion people has spawned an environmental emergency.     Read MoreIndia's energy needs are rising as it tries to extend the manufacturing and tech boom to lift millions more out of poverty. That means more factories, more offices, more residences and vehicles. The country has set itself ambitious targets since signing the Paris Climate Agreement, aiming to source 40% of its energy from renewable sources like wind and solar by 2030. There has been significant progress \u2014 renewable energy now accounts for nearly 23% \u2014 but India is still one of the world's largest oil importers, and more than half of its electricity still comes from burning coal. A perfect stormWhen Sanjay Gupta and his family first moved to Gurgaon in 1999, there was hardly anything around. \"It was sparse, desolate, and for most requirements we would have to go to Delhi,\" he said. \"It was a distance away from everything that we needed.\" Gupta, who worked for American Express, soon moved overseas for stints in New York and Singapore, before returning to Gurgaon as the company's India head in 2006. By then the tech frenzy was firmly underway. \"You always felt that you were in a construction war zone,\" says Gupta, now the CEO of AI education startup EnglishHelper. Today, the drive into Gurgaon \u2014 now officially known as Gurugram \u2014 is a blur of glass buildings and company logos. It's now one of India's fastest-growing cities but mostly makes headlines for having the world's most toxic air, based on an index compiled by Greenpeace and AirVisual that measures the level of fine particulates.As recently as the first week of November, Gurgaon and neighboring New Delhi were blanketed by a layer of smog so thick that officials declared a \"public health emergency,\" dozens of flights were canceled and schools were closed. Traffic pollution and construction dust are partly to blame, but the annual burning of crop waste by local farmers makes the situation worse at this time of year. It's a public health crisis that resurfaces every winter, thanks to what experts refer to as a \"perfect storm\" of pollution. And it only seems to be getting worse. People wearing pollution masks have become an increasingly common sight in Gurgaon. (Ruhani Kaur/Bloomberg/Getty Images)\"Gurgaon had an opportunity to make this a world class city and we are nowhere close to it,\" says Latika Thukral. A former Citibank executive, Thukral quit her job in 2004 and co-founded I Am Gurgaon, a citizen's group that has been working to increase the city's green cover, clean up its water supply and create more open spaces.\"I think the exodus is happening,\" Thukral says. \"There will be no water, pollution is at its peak. Why would people not move out?\"Bangalore's tech boom preceded Gurgaon's and its transformation was even more dramatic. The city, now officially called Bengaluru, used to be dubbed \"Garden City\" or \"Pensioner's Paradise.\" Not any more. Where Gurgaon has poisonous air, Bangalore has gridlock \u2014 the number of vehicles in the city has gone from around 1.4 million in 2000 to more than 8 million this year.           Singh's four-mile commute in Gurgaon used to take him around 15 minutes. In Bangalore, his five-and-a-half mile journey to work usually takes close to an hour. The longest he can recall is two and a half hours.He also says it's not uncommon at Flipkart for people to email colleagues in the morning saying they're working from home because there's just too much traffic, or there were no ride-hailing cabs available. \"The biggest worrying factor seems to be that there seems to be no immediate solution,\" he says. \"The city seems like it was built for 10 people and we've put in 10,000.\"     According to estimates last year from the Japan International Cooperation Agency, which is helping build a system to ease Bangalore's traffic woes, the average speed on the city's roads during the morning rush is just 8 miles per hour. \"The biggest challenge which Bangalore is facing now is that of unbridled growth,\" the city's municipal commissioner B.H. Anilkumar told CNN Business. City authorities are thinking about introducing bus lanes and even a London-style congestion tax to ease the pressure on roads, he said. But those will take time to put in place. Bangalore's higher elevation and moderate climate mean it doesn't get blanketed by smog like Gurgaon and Delhi.  However, multiple independent studies from recent years have said transportation is the biggest source of harmful emissions in the city \u2014 contributing about 40%. Running out of water Both cities have another huge problem in common \u2014 they're using up water faster than it can be replenished. Their populations are projected to more than double over the next decade after rapid expansion in recent years, further straining already maxed-out  infrastructure. Gurgaon and Bangalore (and 19 more Indian cities) will run out of groundwater next year, according to estimates by government-run think tank NITI Aayog. \"Industrial growth in and around cities will be severely compromised as companies will move their operations to more water-secure locations,\" the think tank said in a recent report.\"There will be no water, pollution is at its peak. Why would people not move out?\" Latika Thukral, co-founder, I Am GurgaonMillions already rely on private water tankers because government supplies are often inadequate. Bangalore's groundwater usage is running at 143%, according to the latest government data, meaning it's consuming more every year than comes from rain and runoff. For Gurgaon that number is 220%. \"If you look at the map of Gurgaon in the 1970s and trace out the rivulets... it's like a web,\" says M.D. Sinha, a senior official at the city's metropolitan development authority, the GMDA. \"Now you trace it and you'll see that a lot of these have become roads.\"Millions in India's big tech cities depend on private water tankers because government supplies are inadequate. (Manjunath Kiran/AFP/Getty Images)Set up in 2017, the GMDA is focusing on recycling water and setting up sewage treatment plants. \"Water... can be viewed as both a waste and a resource,\" says Sinha, who heads the city's conservation efforts. \"It is now being viewed as a resource, and that is the shift we need for all our resources. We need to understand that we must save it or it will destroy us.\"Getting involvedCompanies that rode India's tech boom know they have to pitch in because the future of their business may depend on it.\"If some things are not done or a lot of things are not done, can it get worse? Yes, it can absolutely can get rapidly worse so it is important that everybody gets with it,\" says Aditya Ghosh, a member of OYO's board. (Ghosh was OYO's India and South Asia chief until Dec. 2 when he was succeeded in that role by Rohit Kapoor.)OYO, which operates over 20,000 hotels across 80 countries, is in the process of moving to a bigger headquarters in Gurgaon. Ghosh says the company has tried to make its new office sustainable, ensuring proximity to public transportation, creating larger open spaces to reduce the need for air conditioning and lighting, and cutting down paper and plastic use. It is making similar efforts in its hotels to promote recycling, waste management and rain water harvesting.OYO's current office has 3,000 employees across eight floors. The new office will accommodate those employees across five floors. \"Every time you add that next floor you're actually leaving behind a bigger footprint,\" Ghosh says. \"You can be despondent that this is never going to be enough but you have got to take those small steps and believe that can make a difference.\" Aditya Ghosh, OYO board memberMore than 1,300 miles south in Bangalore, Flipkart and Amazon are locked in a race to reduce their impact on the environment, even as they fight for top spot in India's online retail market. Flipkart announced in late August that it would eliminate single-use plastic packaging from its supply chain by March 2021. Amazon said a week later that it would do so by June 2020. The companies are testing out alternatives made of paper, cardboard and other recyclable materials. Flipkart has also started collecting plastic packaging material from customers so it doesn't end up in landfills.Both companies also say they're trying to reduce the amount of packaging each delivery requires and the carbon footprint of their vehicles. \"If I was to compare last year versus this year, we have doubled the number of customers who have received more than one item in one box,\" says Akhil Saxena, Amazon India's vice president of operations. India's top online retailers are on a mission to increase the amount of recycled material in their packaging. (Manjunath Kiran/AFP/Getty Images)The US company has installed solar power and rainwater harvesting technology at several of its warehouses, as well as motion sensing lights that switch off as soon as workers exit. Flipkart says it has over two dozen warehouses with an ISO 14001 certification, a global standard that rates companies on how well they manage energy consumption, water usage and waste management. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos pledged in September that the company would become carbon neutral by 2040. India poses a particularly large challenge. \"I think if we do get off to a good start in a sustainable manner then the scale up becomes much easier,\" says Saxena. As part of its September pledge, Amazon said it would have 100,000 electric delivery vehicles in operation worldwide by 2023. But the company hasn't yet revealed how many of those will be deployed in India. Walmart-owned Flipkart has already begun using electric delivery vehicles and says 40% of its fleet will be electric by March next year.  Amazon India uses recycled water at its Bangalore headquarters and at its new campus in Hyderabad \u2014 Amazon's largest office building in the world. The company also partnered with a local NGO, city authorities and several other tech firms to help fund and construct a sewage treatment plant at one of Bangalore's dozens of lakes.Flipkart says it has eliminated single-use plastic inside its Bangalore headquarters, which currently accommodates around 8,500 employees, by using alternative materials like stainless steel and glass. The e-commerce firm says the amount of waste it produces has gone down despite its rapid growth. Flipkart executive Mahesh Pratap Singh, who became the company's first head of sustainability earlier this year, says raising awareness among its thousands of employees has had a wider impact on the community.\"When you do something at this scale... it goes back to their homes,\" Singh told CNN Business.No time to loseWhile some of the biggest names in tech and finance are committed to solving India's environmental crisis, there's much more to be done. When it comes to fighting India's pollution, congestion and water shortages, the country's lack of infrastructure can be a challenge. Amazon's Saxena says it's harder to procure plastic substitutes like wood and paper in India in large enough quantities than in more mature economies, and the fact that most deliveries take place on motorcycles rather than vans or trucks means the packaging has to be a lot more flexible and adaptable.\"It's not like a cut paste copy because the contexts are different, the environment is different, the infrastructure is different,\" Saxena adds. Simply put, it's tough for companies in India to keep pace with its growth and drastically reduce their carbon footprint at the same time. \"We are at a stage where we're figuring out mass scale alternatives we can actually take to people,\" says Singh, Flipkart's sustainability head. Flipkart is having to design custom electric vehicles from scratch with a local startup because there aren't viable options locally. Ghosh at OYO says companies only really start changing the way they behave when two things happen: \"When consumers demand it more \u2014 and consumers have started demanding it more \u2014 and secondly when the cost of technology needed to make it happen also starts coming down.\"Gurgaon is consistently ranked among the world's most polluted cities, and the crisis appears to be getting worse. (Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images)The companies all acknowledge the sense of urgency and the enormity of the problem. Time is running out.\"While leadership companies have begun to factor sustainability thinking (including climate change) into their business strategies ... the process clearly needs to be deeper, wider, and faster,\" Shankar Venkateswaran and Mukund Rajan, former heads of sustainability efforts at Indian conglomerate Tata, wrote in \"India and a Warming World\" published earlier this month.Mathur, who now works at Indian e-commerce startup Meesho, says she prefers Bangalore to Gurgaon. But that hasn't stopped her from worrying completely, and she says she feels \"exceptionally\" lucky that her building has a reliable water supply, at least for now.\"For a lot of people that live in Bangalore ... there are massive water outages. That is becoming more and more real and I imagine over the next couple of years that will become a big part of our lives as well,\" she adds.As the water runs out, plastic waste piles up and the air gets ever more toxic, everyone has to do what they can. \"You can be despondent that this is never going to be enough but you have got to take those small steps and believe that can make a difference,\" Ghosh says. \u2014 Esha Mitra contributed to this report",

        "content": "London (CNN Business)Today's classroom is a far cry from the traditional image of locker desks, chalkboards and pencils. With education expected to prepare children for a fast-changing digital workplace, technology-led learning is becoming the norm and kids may be coding before they can read and write. As a result, global spending on educational technology is booming. It's expected to double to $341 billion between 2018 and 2025, according to data and research firm HolonIq. \"We're asking young people what they want to be when they grow up, when maybe more than half of the job's tasks and industries they may work in have not been invented yet,\" says Heather McGowan, a future work strategist who helps to prepare people and organizations for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which will see the world reshaped by artificial intelligence, robotics and other technological breakthroughs.A report by the World Economic Forum notes that 65% of the children entering primary school in 2017 will have jobs that do not yet exist and for which their education will fail to prepare them. Education must adapt accordingly. McGowan thinks this means less focus on transferring knowledge, and more on the ability to learn for yourself. Read More\"The foundational knowledge of the future is your own ability to learn and adapt, because if you don't your career will come to a screeching halt after a couple of years,\" she says. Tools for the futureThis new era of education also demands a fresh set of tools. Take Cubetto, a small wooden robot that moves on a board when a child inserts blocks with commands such as left, right or forward into a connected base. The Cubetto kit, costing $225, is being used by schools and parents to teach children as young as three to code. \"It's a skill that you can apply to anything: you basically learn to think in a very logical and rational manner,\" says Filippo Yacob, founder and CEO of Primo, the toy maker that developed Cubetto.\"For us, it's about making children future proof,\" he adds.The Cubetto kit is helping to teach 3-year-olds to codeHowever, the effectiveness of such tools depends on maintaining the attention span of a young child. \"It needs to be something fun and adventurous, not just homework,\" says Alex Klein, CEO and founder of Kano, an educational technology company. Kano's signature product  \u2014 the Kano computer kit \u2014 is a build-your-own computer or tablet. Students follow a step-by-step guide to connect the parts, and once it's up and running they can play on several apps, from learning to code to creating music and games. \"Kano offers paradigm game-changing opportunities for teaching computer science,\" says Allen Tsui, a teacher at a school in London that uses the device. \"(It) also enables project based learning opportunities to extend collaboration, creativity, communication and critical thinking skills.\"  In the United Kingdom, educators are welcoming the use of technology. According to a survey by Promethean, 54% of teachers are using educational technology this year, and 94% acknowledge that it can improve engagement among students. In October, the Kano PC -- a build-your-own Windows computer -- will be available to purchase for $299Not just for teachingTechnology is not only helping to teach kids, it's also creating a better learning environment. Danish companies Velux and Leapcraft have been working together to introduce sensors into the classroom. They developed the Ambinode \u2014 a small white box that monitors noise, temperature, air particles and CO2 levels. Data is then fed to a smartphone app, so that a teacher or facility manager can monitor the environment and make sure it is as comfortable and productive an environment as possible. One report by the University of Salford found that physical factors such as natural light, temperature and air quality can increase the learning progress of primary school pupils by as much as 16% in a year. \"The danger is, if you don't get these things right, that children are really being hampered in their learning and it's undermining their efforts to progress academically,\" says professor Peter Barrett who led the study.",

        "content": "London (CNN Business)Robots are one step closer to gaining a human sense that has so far eluded them: Touch. Scientists last month unveiled an artificial skin that enables robots to feel and respond to physical contact, a skill that will be needed as they come in increasingly close contact with people.In 2017, manufacturers worldwide used roughly 85 industrial robots per 10,000 employees, according to a report by the International Federation of Robotics. The same report predicts the global supply of industrial robots to grow 14% per year until 2021. But if robots end up working more closely with their fleshy colleagues, one concern is how they will interact safely.\"Currently, robots do not have any sense of touch,\" Professor Gordon Cheng, who developed the special skin with his team at the Technical University of Munich, tells CNN Business. Professor Gordon Cheng with the H-1 robot, covered in 13,000 sensors that enable tactile sensationRead MoreRobots are able to exert forces that could seriously injure a human being, so employers need to ensure they are aware of their surroundings and able to navigate around people.  \"Touch enables safe robot operation, by detecting contact with unseen obstacles and giving the possibility to apply the correct force for achieving a task, without damaging objects, people and the robot itself,\" Chiara Bartolozzi, a robotics expert at the Italian Institute of Technology, independent of the research, tells CNN Business. Not only could this special skin make collaboration between humans and robots safer, it could also enable the future of robots as caregivers, health workers and companions. Mimicking human skinTo develop the synthetic skin, the researchers began by studying humans.Each person has about 5 million skin receptors that register what's happening on the body's surface and send signals to the brain. But the brain can't digest information from each one at the same time. Instead, the nervous system prioritizes new sensations. Mimicking this, the team covered a human-size autonomous robot (known as H-1) with more than 13,000 sensors from shoulder to toe, that are able to detect temperature, acceleration, proximity and pressure.\"These [factors] are fundamental to sense in humans... [they] are what make interactions between human and human very safe,\" says Cheng.The team is currently working on creating smaller sensor cells that could be produced in bulk.Some scientists are skeptical of its scalability. The high cost of each sensor and its fragility is a major barrier for mass production, Etienne Burdet, a professor of human robotics at Imperial College London, tells CNN Business.With a sense of touch robots would be able to respond to physical contact, and could work more closely with humansFor years, scientists have been scrambling to develop technology that enables tactile sensation \u2014 both for robots and humans. Last week, a team at Northwestern University unveiled a wireless and battery-free smart skin that could add touch to virtual experiences, such as a Skype call. Cheng has already overcome one challenge that has hindered previous attempts at creating a robotic sense of touch. Most have relied on vast computing power to process signals from all the artificial skin cells, while his creation only sends signals when individual cells are activated. This means the system is not overloaded with data, and, in that way, it acts just like the human nervous system. For instance, we feel gloves when we first put them on, but eventually our bodies learn to ignore them.Future colleagues or carersThese traits could enable robots to perceive their surroundings with more sensitivity, and give them the ability to interact with humans and anticipate and avoid accidents. \"Technology like this could open opportunities where robots could work much more closely with humans, such as caregiving professions,\" Bob Doyle, vice president of the Robotic Industries Association, tells CNN Business. \"They could help someone get out of bed, or help them around the house,\" he adds. However, Doyle acknowledges that these technologies are still a long way from actual application in the field, and that ensuring the safety of humans will come first.",

        "content": "London (CNN Business)The world has a gargantuan waste problem. Two billion tons of municipal solid waste is generated globally per year, according to the World Bank \u2014 equivalent to the weight of the Great Pyramid of Giza, in trash, every single day. As urban populations continue to grow, some cities are struggling to cope. Many are turning to new technologies for cost-effective solutions to clean up waste.The global waste management market is booming as a result, expected to reach $530 billion by 2025 from $331 billion in 2017, according to a report by Allied Market Research.Cities that address waste problems immediately have the best chance to avoid severe long-term consequences, says Ricardo Cepeda-M\u00e1rquez, solid waste director for C40 Cities, a global network of cities committed to tackling climate change.Waste that goes uncollected can lead to blocked drains, flooding and the spread of waterborne diseases. Organic matter dumped in landfills \u2014 where it lacks the air to decompose quickly \u2014 generates methane gas, accelerating climate change.Trash being separated at an optical sorting plant in Oslo, Norway.Read MoreGenerating energy from wasteCopenhagen, Denmark, recently opened its innovative waste-to-energy power plant, known as Copenhill or Amager Bakke, which is topped with an artificial ski slope. The plant, which burns waste instead of fossil fuels, is capable of converting 450,000 tons of trash into energy annually, delivering electricity to 30,000 households and heating to 72,000. Though it still produces CO2 emissions from burning, the city plans to install a system to capture the carbon released by the incineration process, and then store the carbon or find a commercial use for it. By tapping an otherwise unused resource, it will also help the city move away from its dependence on fossil fuels. \"Instead of placing waste outside in a big landfill, we use the waste to produce energy for heating and electricity in the most efficient way currently available,\" the Lord Mayor of Copenhagen Frank Jensen told CNN Business in an email. \"Efficient waste incineration supplies district heating for 99% of the buildings in Copenhagen, so we will eliminate the pollution from coal, oil and petroleum,\" he adds, helping the capital meet its goal to become the world's first carbon-neutral city by 2025. The plant, located a couple of miles from the city center, will be a city landmark as well as an energy supply.Cities such as Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, Shenzhen in China, and Hanoi in Vietnam are experimenting with similar waste-to-energy plants.But Cepeda-M\u00e1rquez warns that this technology has its limits. A city needs solid infrastructure and a strong waste collection system already in place before it can reap the benefits of one of these plants.  \"Many global south cities, with badly managed waste management systems, expect that with the ideal incinerator or waste-to-energy facility all of their problems will go away,\" he says. \"But if you have a broken system, there is no technology that is going to fix it.\" Smarter systems Other cities are starting on a street level, using artificial intelligence and automation to sort recyclables, or sensors to reduce the amount thrown away. For instance, Singapore and Seoul, South Korea, have installed smart, solar-powered trash cans on their streets. Each is equipped with a compactor, enabling it to hold more trash. Once the bin is full, its sensors alert the waste collectors. By 2050, 68% of the world's population will live in urban areas, according to the UN, putting a strain on existing city infrastructure. Typically, cities send out different trucks to collect different types of waste - one truck collecting plastic for recycling, another collecting food waste, for example. But that requires a lot of trucks, which means added costs and more traffic.\"In many cities in Europe, the streets are very narrow, and there isn't a lot of open space for multiple waste collection trucks to be doing the rounds,\" says Cepeda-M\u00e1rquez.Norway's capital Oslo has designed a clever model to avoid this. Since 2012, city residents have been required to use different colored bags for different types of waste, and instead of collecting them separately, trucks gather all the bags at once and take them to an optical sorting plant. The green bags containing food waste and blue bags with plastic waste are separated from other residual waste by sophisticated optical reading technology, which detects the color of the bags with approximately 98% precision. The city claims that increased waste segregation and public awareness campaigns have had a positive effect, reducing the amount thrown away by each household and increasing the amount that is reused and recycled. In 2018, 37% of household waste was recycled, up from 10% in 2004.",

        "content": "New York (CNN Business)Traditional brick-and-mortar stores alone are not enough to stay ahead in the digital era. America's shoppers want convenient, hassle-free experiences.So Walmart and Nordstrom are building physical stores that don't actually sell anything. The two retailers are creating small hubs in big cities and dense suburban areas for shoppers to retrieve their online grocery and clothing orders. These new locations give them access to shoppers who want their stuff in a hurry without schlepping out to regular big-box stores or waiting around for home delivery.Retail's Amazon antidote: Buy online, pickup in store Earlier this month, Walmart opened Walmart Pickup Point, a 40,000 square-foot prototype store outside of Chicago in Lincolnwood, Illinois, to cater to customers' online pickups and deliveries. Customers drive up to the site to designated parking spots, and a Walmart worker will load up their trunk with their order.The inside of the Lincolnwood locations looks like a Walmart with groceries and everyday items such as diapers, household cleaners and pet supplies. Unlike a traditional Walmart supercenter, however, customers won't be able go inside. It is also testing a similar model near its Arkansas headquarters.The new location \"gives busy customers the ability to shop how, when and where they want,\" store manager Nicole Olson said in a release. Read MoreThe new Walmart locations share similarities with Nordstrom Local, a concept Nordstrom (JWN) first introduced in Los Angeles in 2017. Nordstrom Local hubs are smaller than its traditional department stores. They give customers a place to make pickups and returns and take advantage of Nordstrom's alteration and tailoring services. Nordstrom has three Local stores in Los Angeles and is slated to open its first two in New York City in September. Walmart and Nordstrom's innovations are the latest examples of how retailers are attempting to create distinctive services to fight off Amazon (AMZN).Nordstrom Local in Melrose doesn't carry inventory. Nordstrom has three Local stores in Los Angeles and is slated to open its first two in New York City in September. Buy online, pickup in store growsRetailers have been successfully expanding online pickup options in their stores in recent years. Nordstrom offers pickup at all its more than 100 full-priced locations around the United States, while Walmart is on track to offer pickup at more than 3,000 of its stores by the end of 2019.Walmart Pickup Point and Nordstrom Local are another way these retailers are trying to capitalize on the growth of pickup, especially among younger and wealthier shoppers.More than 15% of US shoppers have already tried online pickup, and sales will hit $35 billion annually by next year, Cowen analysts estimated in a report. Curbside pickup is the \"natural evolution of the traditional in-store shopping experience,\" Cowen analysts said in the report.Pickup appeals to shoppers who want to grab their stuff and go without waiting in checkout lines or interacting with sales workers on the floor, analysts say. Picking up orders from stores can also be faster than home delivery.Walmart's online grocery pickup location in Bentonville, Arkansas.For retailers, pickup is a better economic model for them than delivery because they can avoid paying expensive shipping fees. Many retailers' profit margins have dipped in recent years due to investments in their e-commerce supply chains.Creating customer loyaltyWalmart points out that its Lincolnwood hub broadens its ability to attract shoppers in an area where it can't fit one of its 178,000 square-foot jumbo stores. For Nordstrom, customers who visit Local stores spend two and a half times more on average than regular customers, according to the company. Customers also tend to be younger and more frequent Nordstrom shoppers than those who don't shop at Local.\"The expansion of our local market strategy in New York City is a cornerstone of how we will improve service to our customers,\" Jamie Nordstrom, president of stores, said in May.",

Would we do the same for a computer?As the global market for artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare surges \u2014 expected to rise from $1.3 billion in 2019 to $10 billion by 2024, according to Morgan Stanley \u2014 it seems we may have to. Deep learning is an AI approach modeled on the neural networks of the brain. It can analyze complex layers of information and identify abnormalities or trends in medical images.AI and eyesThe algorithm can detect diseases such as glaucoma from a simple scanPearse Keane, a consultant ophthalmologist at Moorfields Eye Hospital, embraced the potential of deep learning five years ago.Read More\"We're drowning in the numbers of patients that we have to see, and because of that, there are some people who are losing sight irreversibly as they can't get seen and treated quickly enough,\" he tells CNN Business. By applying the technology to OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) scans, he thought it would help prioritize patients with sight-threatening diseases. Keane approached DeepMind, a UK-based AI research center owned by Google (GOOGL), and with them developed an algorithm, trained on 14,884 retinal scans, that can return a detailed diagnosis in roughly 30 seconds. It can detect 50 different eye diseases including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration, provide a score and recommend how urgently patients should be referred for care.Early results for the system, published in the journal Nature Medicine, show that it has the same level of accuracy as leading specialists, correctly identifying types of eye disease 94.5% of the time.   However, before the technique can be implemented in Moorfields Eye Hospital and beyond it must pass through the lengthy process of regulatory approval and clinical trials. \"We're tremendously excited about AI,\" says Keane, \"but also, we're kind of cautious. We know that it has huge potential, but there are some ways that it might not work.\"Improving IVFThis technology could help improve the success rate of IVFScientists at Weill Cornell Medicine are also deploying deep learning algorithms as a time-saving device, identifying which embryos have the best chance of developing into a healthy pregnancy during in vitro fertilization (IVF).The algorithm, dubbed Stork, analyzes time-lapse images of early-stage embryos and is able to discriminate between poor and good embryo quality. According to the research paper published in NPJ Digital Medicine, it performed with 97% accuracy. Usually this is a manual process, by which an embryologist sorts through multiple images, assigning a quality score that helps them decide which ones to implant first. \"Grading of the embryo by a human is very subjective,\" Nikica Zaninovic, an embryologist at the Center for Reproductive Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine, tells CNN Business. \"Using AI to grade the embryos means we can do some standardization.\"The tool would also have a positive impact on the process of IVF as a whole. It could improve the success rate, minimize the risk of multiple pregnancies, and help to reduce the cost of the procedure, says Zev Rosenwaks, director of the Center for Reproductive Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine.Currently, the tool is only available to embryologists at Weill Cornell Medicine in an experimental setting. Expect it to be in practice more widely \"within the next year or two,\" says Zaninovic.Predicting cancer riskAn algorithm, developed by MIT researchers, could identify a woman's risk of breast cancer and help to catch it earlyOne initiative by MIT's Computer Science and AI Lab can predict from a mammogram if a patient is likely to develop breast cancer in the future. The model, trained on breast scans from 60,000 women, learned patterns in breast tissue that were precursors to cancer and too subtle for the human eye to detect. It outperformed existing approaches, placing 31% of all cancer patients in its highest-risk category compared to 18% for traditional models. \"I was interested in creating a model which can identify your future risk of cancer,\" says Regina Barzilay, MIT professor and senior author of the study published in Radiology about the project.As a breast cancer survivor herself, she subsequently applied the technology to her own mammograms. \"I discovered that my cancer was in the breast two years before I was diagnosed,\" she says.Aged 43 at the time and with no history of breast cancer in the family, she had never considered herself at risk. But guidelines like these are unreliable, she says \u2014 only 15% to 20% of breast cancer cases are familial, according to a study from the Journal of Medical Genetics.Using AI could identify women at risk and help them take preventative steps. \"In the early stages cancer is a treatable disease ... If we can identify many more women early enough, and either prevent their disease or treat them at the earliest stages, this will make a huge difference,\" says Barzilay. The model has been implemented in Massachusetts General Hospital, and they are in talks with other hospitals across the country and internationally, says Barzilay.",

        "content": "New York (CNN Business)With growing mental health concerns in the United States, the tech industry continues to search for a solution to get more people in front of therapists and modernize the experience.Some investors are betting on a new mental health startup called Alma, a membership-based group for mental health professionals.Alma launched in October 2018 with a brick and mortar location on New York's Madison Avenue. Local mental health providers can apply for membership to use the space to treat patients, as well as form relationships with other therapists. Providers \u2014 which include psychiatrists, psychologists and clinical social workers, as well as an acupuncturists \u2014 pay $165 per month, plus an hourly rate for booking private rooms, which are outfitted with precisely the same furniture and modern decor so patients benefit from the familiarity, no matter which room they meet in.In exchange, Alma provides members with a suite of services, such as billing, scheduling, and tools for treating patients over video chat. The idea is to make it easier, and possibly more affordable, for them to perform tasks associated with running their own business. There's also a communal kitchen and frequent events held in the space.Read MoreAlma has a \"matchmaker\" on staff who specializes in mental health counseling, and is devoted to pairing patients with professionals that suit their specific needs.This week, founder and CEO Harry Ritter told CNN Business that Alma has raised $8 million in new funding towards its expansion. The round was led by venture capital firm Tusk Venture Partners, bringing Alma's total funding to $12.5 million to date. Other investors include Sound Ventures, First Round Capital, Primary Ventures, and Box Group.People are sick of drinking. Investors are betting on the 'sober curious'Alma is rolling out a community membership option for those who aren't interested in using the physical space but want in on its other services. For now, it's available to those in New York who may have their own offices but want access to Alma's network, referrals, client matching, events and billing services. The cost for community membership is $145 per month.Alma has \"meditation stations\" in its lobby so patients can take guided meditation from the Headspace app before or after sessions.In other words, Alma aims to build a \"community\" for providers both online and offline \u2014 a term that's become something of a buzzword in the tech space, with companies like The Wing and WeWork raising millions to form \"communities\" for their members.\"Alma\" in Aramaic and Latin means \"world\" and \"soul,\" according to Ritter, who said the company aims to draw \"soulfulness down into the world.\" Ritter, who has law and medical degrees, previously served as Oscar Health's vice president of care delivery, where he helped open the healthcare startup's brick and mortar location in Brooklyn in 2016. Ritter said he created Alma to serve a need he saw in the mental health space: supporting mental health professionals -- who are often running their own private practices -- with community, and the tools needed to help them run their businesses. Why these companies are giving employees a mental health break\"Our customer is the client-provider relationship,\" Ritter said. \"We respect the sanctity of two people needing to sit in a room and talk.\"While access to affordable mental health care is a significant barrier for many considering seeking help, Ritter said providers set their own fees, and can decide for themselves whether they accept insurance. The hope is that they'll pass on any savings as a result of belonging to Alma to patients, Ritter added.According to Jasmin Terrany, a therapist based in New York City who is not affiliated with Alma, a pain point facing young therapists is that \"you've done all this training and you have all these skills, but getting clients is a whole other animal. You didn't go and get your Master's in business.\" (Ritter said that most of the therapists currently part of Alma's network have between six and 15 years of experience.)Terrany added that while she's been practicing for more than a decade, anything that can make mental health professionals feel less alone and supported would be a good thing. \"I think burnout is real.\" Former WeWork VP sues the company alleging age discriminationThere's a growing need to address mental health issues in the US. The most common mental illness in the US are anxiety disorders, which affect 40 million adults, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. They're highly treatable, but only about 37% of those suffering get treatment. Technology is also making people more anxious, according to one recent study. It found that psychological well-being was higher when adolescents spent more time doing real-world activities, and lower when they were on their screens. That can make the issue feel more personal to the tech world, which often touts its abilities to solve societal problems.Tech investors have poured money into the space before, including in telemedicine startups devoted to mental health.",

Vertical farming refers to produce that's grown indoors, often in stacks that resemble a bookcase. It requires less space and water than traditional cultivation methods. The UK company said it has formed a joint venture called Infinite Acres with vertical farming company 80 Acres Farms, and Priva Holdings, which sells industrial horticultural systems.Ocado (OCDDY) has also taken a majority stake in Jones Food Company, which it describes as the largest operating vertical farm in Europe.

It's already well known for building warehouses where thousands of robots zoom around the premises to pack groceries.\"The fusion of technology, sustainability and innovation is relatively new, but is a growing trend in the industry,\" said Mike Watkins, head of retailer and business insight at Nielsen UK.Vertical farms can help reduce water use. But critics say they use too much energy.The company is increasingly focused on licensing its robotic warehouse tech to other retailers, and already has deals with Kroger (KR) in the United States and Casino (CGUSY) in France.It is also developing a robot called \"SecondHands\" that can pick and package produce without damaging it.Ocado's stock jumped 3% in London, pushing its gains so far this year to 45%.

        "content": "New York (CNN Business)Instagram is great for sharing photos, interacting with celebrities and discovering trendy looks \u2014 everything even Amazon has struggled to perfect. Fashion houses, retailers and big brands see an opportunity.Until recently, brands have used Instagram mostly as an advertising tool to reach consumers. But Instagram has made a series of moves to become a shopping hub, forcing companies to adapt their digital strategies.Although Instagram remains a very small player in retail, if the platform disrupts shopping one day, retailers who got blindsided by Amazon years ago want to be ahead of the curve this time. Instagram Checkout.In March, Instagram introduced a new checkout option that allows customers to purchase products directly off a handful of companies' pages within its app. Previously, shoppers had to leave Instagram when they found a product on the app and buy it off retailers' websites. That was an irritation for customers, analysts say. Instagram has also added tools that allow customers to shop items on its Stories and Explore pages. And shoppers can buy looks that Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian West and other celebrities wear on their Instagram feeds directly through their posts.Read MoreInstagram is a useful tool for shoppers to easily discover a curated mix of clothing from brands and celebrities, experts say. This type of hunt can often be frustrating for customers online. That's because browsing to find clothing is challenging on Amazon or retailers' websites and apps, where shoppers often have to scroll through dozens of pages and hundreds of products. \"What the internet hasn't been particularly good at is solving for discovery and window shopping,\" said Andrew Lipsman, analyst at eMarketer. \"Instagram is starting to help fill that need for shoppers.\" Instagram launched long-form video last year. Is anyone watching?Instagram's efforts to transform into a shopping hub have enticed some brands. These companies see an untapped market to sell their merchandise directly to their large Instagram followings. Companies like Adidas say they are taking advantage of the new tool by launching new sneakers and clothes on Instagram.\"Our consumer spends a ton of time on Instagram,\" said Emily Maxey, vice president of marketing at Adidas. \"The consumer is using Instagram to research our products, connect with friends to get recommendations about our products, and ultimately buy.\"Instagram's strategy resembles the popular social media app WeChat in China, said Lipsman. WeChat, the dominant messaging platform in China, has been successful getting shoppers to purchase off the app.A growing opportunity Shopping off Instagram could be a $10 billion market by 2021, according to Deutsche Bank, and the platform allows brands to woo shoppers beyond their own websites, brick-and-mortar stores and Amazon (AMZN). Instagram says that 80% of the app's users follow a business. More than 130 million users every month tap Instagram posts to see shopping product tags.\"It's early days for shopping on Instagram, but we're excited about this over the long run,\" Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said on an analyst call last month. Facebook (FB) owns Instagram. Social influencers see stardom potential on LinkedIn and PinterestMore than 20 brands, including Nike (NKE), Adidas, Uniqlo, Warby Parker, Outdoor Voices, Prada, Dior and Kylie Cosmetics, are testing an updated checkout feature with Instagram. These companies hope the option will make it easier for customers to purchase through Instagram and boost their sales off the platform. Companies like Adidas (ADDDF) and Burberry (BURBY) also say they are teaming up with Instagram to gain a larger stake in the future of shopping through social media. \"We can be a first mover,\" said Maria Culp, spokesperson for the sportswear company.Warning signs for retailersInstagram does not disclose the fee it takes when shoppers buy a product off its app and brands have stayed mum about their financial arrangements.Despite Instagram and its partner brands' optimism, analysts say there are challenges for retailers selling through the platform and embracing Instagram too closely.It's hard for companies to make a profit on Instagram, said Jason Goldberg, chief commerce officer at advertising firm Publics. On Instagram, retailers sell one item at a time to customers, instead of trying to get them to buy a basket of items like they do on their e-commerce sites. \"You can't say 'Oh, would you like socks with those shoes?' If someone wants to buy two things, they have to go through checkout twice,\" he said.Sucharita Kodali, analyst at Forrester Research, argued that brands should be wary of becoming too dependent on Instagram for sales. That's because brands don't have as much control over their customers on Instagram as they do at their own physical stores or e-commerce sites.\"You're basically handing over some of your most important proprietary information to companies that have no commitment to your privacy and have no respect for the delineation between their customers and yours,\" she said.\u2014 CNN Business' Kaya Yurieff contributed to this article.",

        "content": "London, UK (CNN Business)Do you ever think about where your food comes from? Or whether your coffee was harvested by someone who was paid a fair wage? These are questions that blockchain can help answer.Consumers are becoming more interested in where their food comes from, and how it is packaged. Many people are even changing their shopping habits based on that information.Blockchain can help track the production of consumer staples across complicated supply chains, giving consumers the data they need to make informed choices. The online public ledger creates a permanent and unchangeable record of transactions. Each transaction is time-stamped and linked to the last, so that it can't later be altered. Read MoreCreating a fair supply chainA yellowfin tuna is tagged with a QR code on board fishing vessel in FijiThe traceability offered by blockchain is invaluable when trying to untangle supply chains that are associated with illegal practices and human rights abuses.Take fishing, for example. Illegal fishing accounts for up to 31% of catches worldwide, according to the Environmental Justice Foundation. World Wildlife Fund is trying to address the issue with a blockchain traceability project focused on tuna in the Pacific. In January, the group launched a tracking platform called OpenSc.An electronic tag is affixed to each fish as it comes on board a vessel, which automatically registers at the dock and processing facility. As the fish is prepared for sale and packaged, it receives a specific QR code.The consumer can then scan the code to see where the fish was caught, manufactured, processed and how it was transported to the shop.World Wildlife Fund uses the data to focus on human rights abuses in the industry such as forced labor and modern slavery. It can learn about staff in the supply chain and their working conditions. \"It's no magic bullet,\" says Dermot O'Gorman, CEO of World Wildlife Fund Australia, \"but it's a tool that helps to stamp out slave trade.\"O'Gorman says the World Wildlife Fund hopes to extend these practices to other commodities, such as paper, beef, palm oil and dairy.\"Unless we're able to address, for example, the illegal aspects in fisheries or human rights abuses in the palm oil industry, we're not going to be able to deliver a sustainable planet,\" he says.Streamlining the supply chainWalmart introduced blockchain technology for food safety purposesComplex supply chains can be hard to digitize. The challenge is convincing fishermen or farmers to apply technology at the source.O'Gorman says it helps to offer a financial incentive. He says that many smaller producers are interested in OpenSC because it helps to optimize operations and reduce costs, through eliminating bottlenecks and enabling more accurate forecasts of supply and demand.Ramesh Gopinath, one of the leaders of the IBM Food Trust, a global network of suppliers and retailers including Walmart and Carrefour, says that blockchain can also have a huge impact on efficiency. \"If along the supply chain there is a sharing of information, that will have significant benefits in terms of improved freshness to the end consumer and reducing waste overall,\" he says.Access to data allows suppliers to predict market conditions more accurately and to localize the sourcing of ingredients -\u2014 ultimately shortening the supply chain, Gopinath explains. The adoption of digital supply chain tools could reduce food loss and waste by up to $120 billion annually, according to a 2018 report by the Boston Consulting Group.Trustworthy supply chainsBellucci olive oil prides itself on being able to prove its provenance to consumers through blockchainTraceability also means accountability, because blockchain can give a tamper-proof guarantee of a product's origin. This is crucial for products where food fraud is common, such as olive oil, which the European Commission has marked as a major target for fraudulent activity. \"You can have an Italian name, but not necessarily have Italian oil in the bottle,\" says Susan Testa, director of culinary innovation at the olive oil producer Bellucci. To prove their provenance, both to consumers and retailers, Bellucci is deploying blockchain technology developed by Oracle along their supply chain. \"They want to know how close the product is to the source,\" says Testa. \"That way, they feel good about the brand and what they're buying.\"",

        "content": "London (CNN Business)Cities are difficult to navigate at the best of times, but for people with disabilities they can be like an obstacle course and a maze wrapped into one.A UK national travel survey found that adults with mobility difficulties took 39% fewer trips than those with no disability in 2017. Yet that could change as devices and cities grow smarter. Assistive tech is playing a big role in the transformation. The global value of the industry is expected to increase from $14 billion in 2015 to $30.8 billion in 2024, according to Zion Market Research and Coherent Market Insights.Here are three high-tech solutions making cities easier for people with disabilities.A wheelchair that can climb stairsThe Scewo wheelchair has rubber tracks that can climb stairsRead MoreJose Di Felice, from Switzerland, was paralyzed in both legs and one arm after a high-speed motorcycle accident three years ago.  While adjusting to life in a wheelchair, he realized that stairs were his biggest hurdle. He took to YouTube to look for alternatives and discovered Scewo. The startup has built a wheelchair that can be controlled through a smartphone. It can tackle a range of terrains, and has special rubber tracks for climbing stairs.Di Felice requested a test drive and soon after he was climbing the steps of the local town hall in a wheelchair. \"It was really emotional to go up these stairs, and look down there and say that it's possible,\" he says.The wheelchair is expected to be distributed to users by the end of 2019, and Di Felice will be one of the first to receive the product.\"We cannot wait on having all these ramps built,\" Bernhard Winter, the CEO and founder of Scewo, says of urban mobility. \"This is why we developed this product, so it gives you back mobility and freedom.\"A robotic exomuscle suitMichael Hagmann, who suffers from a degenerative muscle disease, completed a 7km leg of the Zurich marathonWearable tech is also becoming more sophisticated. Zurich-based start-up MyoSwiss has developed an exomuscle suit with a combination of robotics and textiles.The robotic garment, weighing less than 5 kilograms (11 pounds), adds a layer of muscle that supports movements and provides stability to people with mobility impairments. It uses sensors at the knee and hip to detect movements the user wants to make and helps accordingly.\"It assists people that need extra force or extra assistance in their daily life,\" says Jaime Duarte, CEO of MyoSwiss. \"[It's] for people that can still walk to some extent but maybe struggle to stand out from a chair or struggle to go upstairs.\"This year the MyoSuit enabled two people with mobility limitations to take part in a relay version of the Zurich marathon. Smart walking stick Kursat Ceylan (right) uses the WeWalk smart stick on his way to workAnother technology that could transform lives is a smart walking stick designed by engineers from Young Guru Academy (YGA) in Turkey. The WeWalk stick has an ultrasonic sensor that detects obstacles above chest level and uses vibrations to warn the user. It can be paired with a smartphone to help navigation, and is integrated with a voice assistant and Google Maps.According to the World Health Organization, 39 million people worldwide are blind and another quarter of a billion are visually impaired. \"In these days we are talking about flying cars,\" says Kursat Ceylan, CEO and founder of WeWalk, \"but these people have been using just a plain stick.\"Ceylan, who has been blind since birth, says that connecting the stick to the Internet of Things and smart city solutions makes it user-friendly. \"As a blind person, when I am at the Metro station I don't know which is my exit ... I don't know which bus is approaching ... [or] which stores are around me. That kind of information can be provided with the WeWalk,\" he says.But will these high-tech solutions be accessible?\"These are all really exciting initiatives that will make a huge difference to some people,\" says Anna Lawson, the director of the Center for Disability Studies at Leeds University in the United Kingdom. \"But they are very expensive ... they're not going to be available to the vast majority of disabled people,\" she added.Bryan Matthews, a lecturer at the Institute for Transport Studies at the University of Leeds, shares the concerns about cost. He says there should also be a focus on inclusive design. But anything that helps people navigate their environment is positive. \"By making disabled people more visible and more mainstream then you foster more potential for understanding and empathy,\" says Matthews.",

Einride said the trial, which is due to run until the end of 2020, is the first time a fully self-driving truck without a backup driver has been allowed on a public road. This self-driving electric truck is now being tested in an industrial zone in Sweden.The \"T-Pod\" truck is supervised remotely by an operator who can take control if necessary. Other companies have completed test runs on public roads with a driver inside the vehicle ready to take over.The 26-ton truck is equipped with cameras, radars and 3D sensors, which give it 360-degree awareness of its surroundings. Built by Einride, it uses an autonomous driving platform made by NVIDIA (NVDA), and its systems are connected via a 5G network. It has a range of 200 kilometers (124 miles). Read MoreThe route it takes from a warehouse to a freight terminal building is just 300 meters long, but it includes five right-angle turns and a 100-meter stretch of road used by other trucks and vehicles.Germany is opening its first electric highway for trucksAn Einride spokesperson said the T-Pod will be making the trip several times a day during the trial. The truck can reach speeds of up to 85 kilometers per hour (53 miles per hour), but is only allowed to drive at 5 kilometers per hour (3 miles per hour) during the trial. The speed limit was set by the Swedish Transport Agency.While the road can get busy, traffic speeds are generally low, the spokesperson added.The truck is only allowed to go slowly during the test runs. Businesses around the world are getting excited about the prospect of driverless trucks given the growing shortage of drivers. The American Trucking Associations said transport companies need roughly 60,000 extra drivers. In Europe, there are 150,000 unfilled truck driver positions, according to Transport Intelligence, a logistics research company.",

Instead, VaakEye uses behavior to predict criminal action.Company founder Ryo Tanaka said his team fed the algorithm 100,000 hours worth of surveillance data to train it to monitor everything from the facial expressions of shoppers to their movements and clothing.Since VaakEye launched last month, it has been rolled out in 50 stores across Japan.Vaak claims that shoplifting losses dropped by 77% during a test period in local convenience stores. That could help reduce global retail costs from shoplifting, which hit $34 billion in 2017 according to the Global Shrink Index.Read MoreMoral questionsUsing AI to catch thieves raises all kinds of ethical questions. \"While the incentive is to prevent theft, is it legal or even moral to prevent someone from entering a store based on this software?\" said Euromonitor retail analyst Michelle Grant. This should not be up to the software developer, says Tanaka. \"What we provide is the information of the suspicious, detected image. We don't decide who is criminal, the shop decides who's criminal,\" he said.Europe is making AI rules now to avoid a new tech crisisYet that is precisely what concerns the human rights charity Liberty, which is campaigning to ban facial recognition technology in the United Kingdom.\"A retail environment \u2014 a private body \u2014 is starting to perform something akin to a police function,\" said Hannah Couchman, Liberty's advocacy and policy officer.  Liberty is also worried about the potential of AI to fuel discrimination. A 2018 study by MIT and Stanford University found that various commercial facial-analysis programs demonstrated skin-type and gender biases. Tanaka explains that since the Vaak software is based on behavior rather than race or gender, this should not be a problem. But Couchman remains skeptical. \"With technologies that rely on algorithms \u2014 particularly in regards to human behavior \u2014 the potential for discrimination is always there,\" she said. \"Humans have to teach the algorithm what to treat suspiciously.\" Customer consentThen there is the issue of transparency. \"Are people aware of what's happening?\" asked Couchman. \"Do they consent? Is it meaningful consent? What happens to the data? How is it protected? Might it be shared?\"Google scraps its controversial AI ethics council days after it was announcedGrant said consumers are willing to sacrifice some privacy for convenience \u2014 such as using face recognition for payment authentication \u2014 but only when they're aware the technology is being used.Tanaka does not dispute this. \"There should be notice before they [customers] enter the store so that they can opt out,\" he said. \"Governments should operate rules that make stores disclose information \u2014 where and what they analyze, how they use it, how long they use it,\" he said. Christopher Eastham, a specialist in AI at the law firm Fieldfisher, said the framework for regulating the technology is not yet in place.\"There is a need for clarity from lawmakers and guidance from regulators, who will ultimately need to decide in what circumstances the use of this technology will be appropriate or desirable as a matter of public policy,\" he said.",

Next-generation 5G networks can be 100 times faster than 4G, making communication between devices and servers much quicker. 5G can also carry much more data than other networks.That makes the technology ideal for transmitting information from remote sensors and drones, key tools that are being tested by farmers. 5G is also helping to automate farming processes.Drones that use 5G are helping to improve potato production in the Netherlands. And in Japan, 5G sensors are used to monitor the water temperature and salt concentration of oyster farms. 5G collarsRead MoreUK initiative 5G RuralFirst launched a smartphone app in March called Me+Moo, which lets farmers track a \"connected\" cow and receive daily updates on the animal's health and behavior.The system, which is being tested on cows at the Agri-Epi Center in Somerset, England, is funded in part by a UK government grant and supported by the tech company Cisco (CSCO).Cows are equipped with 5G-connected collars that monitor their health and habitsThe cows wear 5G-connected collars that send data to the app on everything from what they're eating to how they're sleeping. Farmers can see the info instantly, and pass it on to veterinarians or nutritionists.\"This provides peace of mind that the cows are happy, healthy and behaving normally, as well as early warning if they are getting sick, are pregnant or need to be checked,\" said project manager Duncan Forbes.How 5G will make daily life better 5G evangelists argue that because farms cover large areas that are difficult to monitor, the agriculture sector is well placed to benefit from remote data collection.The technology could help irrigation systems to turn on at the optimal time of day, or cattle to be grazed on areas that provide the best nutrition. By improving efficiency, it will be possible to produce more food. Yet to make a difference, 5G will first need to be installed in rural areas.Automation mattersThe UN Food and Agriculture Organization predicts that in order to provide for the world's rapidly rising population, the planet will need to grow 70% more food in 2050 than it did in 2009. \"To respond to those demands, farmers will need new technologies to produce more from less land, with fewer hands,\" reads one report from the organization. That's where automation comes in. In 2017, another 5G RuralFirst project became the first in the world to successfully plant, tend and harvest a crop without a single human stepping foot in the field. How do you insure a driverless car? Autonomous tractors sowed the seeds, drones with sensors monitored the crops, and smaller machines took samples to assess what fertilizers and pesticides to apply and where. The project, called Hands-Free Hectare, reported another successful harvest in 2018. It's now going even further by using 5G technology to increase precision and efficiency in crop spraying. \"This will help not only sustain farming, but also make it easier and less demanding for those doing it,\" Jonathan Gill, a researcher at Harper Adams University, said of the innovations.",

But who will pay when a crash does happen?The transportation revolution raises big questions for insurers around liability, data and future revenues. With driverless car trials ongoing in a number of markets, policymakers are already preparing for the new landscape. In the United Kingdom, work is underway to ensure a regulatory framework is in place when automated vehicles hit roads. Last year, lawmakers approved the Automated and Electric Vehicles (AEV) Act, bringing greater clarity on insurance policies and liability for road accidents involving driverless vehicles.In other markets -- such as the United States, for example -- the state of play is less certain.What about liability?Read MoreDavid Williams, technical director at AXA Insurance UK, explained that British rules set out a clear structure for liability, with car owners still required to purchase an insurance policy that complies with road traffic rules.Read: How 5G will make daily life betterMany automated cars will be able to switch modes, from automated to driver-controlled, but having two distinct insurance policies to cover each scenario is \"too complicated,\" according to Williams. Instead, car owners will buy one insurance policy that covers both driving modes. Insurers will continue to pay out for claims, but could recoup some costs from carmakers when their technology causes an accident.Williams expects the number of road accidents to decline, which means insurers will likely face fewer motor claims. \"And a proportion of these claims will be passed on to the manufacturers,\" he said.Insurers want to see similar rules put in place throughout Europe.  \"We take the view that compulsory third-party liability insurance works well in protecting road users and that this will continue to be the case with ongoing technological developments, such as connected and autonomous vehicles,\" said Nicolas Jeanmart, head of personal insurance, general insurance and macroeconomics at Insurance Europe.JUST WATCHEDInside look at driverless carsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHInside look at driverless cars 01:50Safer roadsAccording to figures from the US Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, human error is a factor in 94% of car crashes.Automated cars could remove this human error factor and lead to safer roads -- and lower insurance premiums -- for car owners. \"If, in time, 50% of cars are safer and have less accidents, that means the remaining manual cars will have less accidents too,\" Williams said. Read: Can technology make these cities smartest?Claims costs for accidents involving automated cars might initially be high due to the cost of replacing damaged technology, such as sensors. But Williams thinks costs will decline as production of autonomous vehicles ramps up.When accidents do happen, new technology will mean greater insights on what happened and who is at fault. \"For claims to be handled as swiftly and smoothly as possible, it will be vital that insurers and other parties with a legitimate interest have access to the relevant in-vehicle data that establishes the facts of an accident, so that liability can be correctly apportioned,\" said Jeanmart.A changing marketInsurers expect that a shift towards driverless vehicles will ultimately lead to lower car insurance premiums and new types of products.Read: How VR is transforming HRFor example, Williams said that insurers might offer insurance products that encourage car owners to use autonomous mode more frequently, offering a premium incentive to reflect the reduced risk.In the future, automated vehicles could allow for shared car ownership, which would mean new types of insurance policies. \"Even in the case of shared vehicles, the vehicle itself still needs to be insured, regardless of whether the insurance is shared between the owners or otherwise,\" Jeanmart said.",

Or if it's technological advances, San Francisco and Silicon Valley might come to mind. But, the cities at the forefront of this growing urban revolution are often the unexpected. Take Kalasatama, a city being built from scratch on the outskirts of Helsinki, Finland. Developers say that by its completion in 2030, residents will get an average hour of their day back by living there.Finland's smart city Kalasatama is custom-built to make daily life more efficientCity residents will never again be stuck behind a rubbish lorry on their commute. Engineers have outfitted the whole city with a vacuum waste system, where people simply take their trash to a port and it gets sucked to an underground disposal center. Another time-saving design is the city layout itself. Public services, such as schools, hospitals and transportation are close to one another and easily accessible. Read More\"Five more minutes walking in the park, five more minutes with the kids before I have to leave for work, five more minutes earlier at home when I don't have to spend on logistics,\" Kerkko Vanhanen, the program director for Smart Kalasatama, tells CNN.  \"Your life is easier because of living in the most functional city in the world,\" he adds. However, only 3,500 people currently live in Kalasatama. By 2030, developers hope to have housed 25,000 people and created 10,000 jobs. UrbanizationWith 68% of humanity expected to live in urban areas by 2050, according to a 2018 UN report, urban expansion and innovation are vital.This is not a new phenomenon: such transformations have been going on for centuries, from city planning in Mesopotamia to 17th-Century canal systems in Amsterdam installed for defense and water management. Amsterdam is contributing to smart city development with its innovative open data programBut now development is less about infrastructure and more about an interconnected system of devices, known as the Internet of Things (IoT). Cisco defines the IoT as the point in time when more \"things or objects\" were connected to the Internet than people. It estimates that by 2020 there will be 50 billion \"things\" talking to each other.With the shift to 5G and superfast bandwidth speeds, IoT has the potential to make cities more convenient -- enabling technology such as traffic sensors or autonomous drones. New meets oldCities don't have to be custom-built to be able to unlock this potential. The ancient cliffside city of Matera in southern Italy is working to become one of the first 5G-enabled cities in Europe. It believes 5G can help it become a center of digital tourism, using technology such as Virtual Reality to show off the cultural and artistic heritage of the city that was named European Capital of Culture in 2019. \"There's been a real focus to rejuvenate this area. And to make it a center first of all of tourism but also to take efforts to make it a place for investment in an industry,\" says Jonathan Reichental, an expert on emerging technology trends in urban environments.The ancient Italian city of Matera aims to become one of the first 5G-enabled cities in EuropeCitizen dataHigh-tech conveniences come at the cost of sharing personal data. \"Data about you is used for delivering all sorts of both public and private services. And people are concerned about what that means to their privacy,\" says Reichental.As smart cities evolve, governments need to gain the trust of citizens to use their private data responsibly, says Udo Kock, deputy mayor of Amsterdam, where an open data program is helping to make it one of Europe's most innovative environments.\"Don't think of Smart Cities as just a technology solution, think of it as collaboration. Involve communities, involve citizens and it's very important for governments to work together with businesses and private citizens,\" says Kock.",

Nor do I see it becoming a machine-only model for a long, long time.\"Philip Watson, chief innovation officer at Citi Private BankMuch of the technology that elite investors use isn't really new. Financial firms are just better able to harness the power of AI and machine learning because today's computers can process information much faster. And there now exists vastly more data than there did years ago.Read MoreThe rise of machine learningStill, technology is rapidly disrupting the financial industry -- and will continue to do so.\"The rise of machine learning will really make our industry unrecognizable in the future,\" said Anthony Cowell, head of asset management for KPMG in the Cayman Islands. His clients include some of the world's largest asset managers, hedge funds and private-equity firms.IBM's fast-talking AI machine just lost to a human champion in a live debateFor instance, Citi Private Bank has deployed machine learning to help financial advisors answer a question they're frequently asked: What are other investors doing with their money? By using technology, the bank can anonymously share portfolio moves being made by clients all over the planet. \"Traditionally that kind of information was sourced from your network. You might have had a few coffees or heard about it over a cocktail,\" Philip Watson, head of the global investment lab at Citi and chief innovation officer at Citi Private Bank, told CNN Business. \"Now, we can share insight that is very valuable.\"Citi also built a recommender engine that uses machine learning tools to advise clients. The platform recommends tailored research reports, solutions and even alerts clients of major events such as the maturity of a bond in their portfolio. Machines assist high-speed tradersDomeyard, a Boston hedge fund that focuses on high-frequency trading, depends on machine learning to decipher 300 million data points in the New York Stock Exchange's opening hour of trading alone.\"We rely on the help of machines to make easier and faster predictions of what will happen in the next second or minute,\" said Christine Qi, Domeyard's co-founder and partner. We do believe that 100% of all roles and jobs could be impacted.\"IBM's Mark FosterBut Qi cautioned that machines are \"only as smart as the data you're feeding it.\"Earlier this year, PanAgora, the Boston quant shop, expanded its exposure to China by launching a \"self-learning\" algorithm that deciphers Chinese \"cyber slang\" used by investors on social media to get around government censorship, Chen said. The findings give portfolio managers at PanAgora a valuable window into sentiment among retail investors, who dominate the market in China. Man vs. machine?Technology executives warn not to believe all the hype about artificial intelligence and machine learning -- especially about robots taking over. \"Some of the effects can be wildly exaggerated,\" said Citi's Watson. \"It's a human plus machine world. It's not a machine-only model. Nor do I see it becoming a machine-only model for a long, long time.\"PanAgora's Chen agreed. \"It's not man versus machine. It's man plus machine.\"At PanAgora, humans have the final say on investment decisions and at times override what the computer models tell them to do.\"Machines are not sentient. Terminators are not going to rise up and kill us all in the next 10 years,\" Chen said. \"I hope.\"Most jobs will be impactedBut that doesn't mean humans won't be disrupted.  \"We do believe that 100% of all roles and jobs could be impacted,\" said Mark Foster, senior vice president of IBM (IBM) Global Business Services.Foster said that the most optimistic outcome is that businesses, governments and education systems get ahead of this disruption by re-skilling workers. Trump to sign executive order launching artificial intelligence initiative \"Probably the world is moving more slowly than that. There is a risk that people will be left behind,\" Foster said. \"It's incumbent upon us in business that we're helping our workforces get ahead of the curve.\"Rather than getting outright displaced, Citi's Watson thinks many workers doing menial back-office jobs could be moved to more rewarding positions.What's next?In the future, the financial industry will be further disrupted by the rise of emerging technologies -- like quantum computing.\"It will be able to solve problems we could never touch before,\" said Mark Jackson, scientific lead at UK-based Cambridge Quantum Computing. IBM (IBM), Google, Intel (INTC) and other major companies have spent heavily to develop quantum technologies, but experts aren't exactly sure what these super computers will be used for. \"We actually don't know yet,\" Jackson said when asked for specific use cases. \"We're just beginning to understand the power of this.\"He said it's already clear that quantum computers will excel in several areas: encryption, security, chemistry and machine learning. \"It will live up to the hype,\" Jackson said. There are still many things that computers can't do in the financial realm.For instance, sophisticated investors often use game theory to map out how other market players will react to a given situation. Game theory allows firms to cash in by positioning themselves -- before sharp market swings occur.  PanAgora's Chen said that machines can't do that -- yet. \"I hope to see it in the next five to 15 years,\" he said.",

        "content": "Barcelona (CNN Business)In Barcelona, everyone's talking about 5G. As 100,000 people gathered in the Spanish city this week for the Mobile World Congress, the industry's annual conference, the next generation mobile network took center stage.This is not just to do with its super-fast speeds, it's because 5G will create a ripple of developments that will change daily life. \"5G is going to have a massive impact on people lives,\" says Laila Worrell, CEO of Altran North America, a high-tech engineering company. \"We are going to see a big advance in quality of life that 5G can deliver for individuals.\"5G and driverless carsThe BMW iNEXT model is due to hit the market in 2021Read MoreFor starters, there's the part it can play in your commute. Self-driving cars have been on the radar for a while, but with a 5G network they could become reality. Industry players claim 5G can be 100 times faster than 4G and that a huge number of devices will be able to connect to the network simultaneously. This will enable vehicles to talk to each other in real time: they'll know when another car is changing lanes or braking and can adjust to manage traffic accordingly. The BMW iNEXT, an electric SUV expected to come onto the market in 2021, is fitted with sensors that collect and process data from the car's surroundings. \"This car is permanently surveying the road around it and sending relevant bits of information up to the cloud, generating a true real-time map that in turn is pushed down to all the other cars,\" Christoph Grote, senior vice-president of electronics at BMW, tells CNN's Samuel Burke. 5G and beesEven bees will benefit from 5G The benefits of 5G do not stop there. The network could also have environmental impacts when used in smart agriculture.5G is revolutionary but will anybody pay for it?David Houghton, general manager of Asset Tracking Solutions at NimbeLink, tells CNN how 5G and the Internet of Things can help protect honeybees, and in turn the world's food supply.\"Beehives are valuable and as such they are in demand, so hive keepers need to protect them. So, they use asset trackers to essentially monitor the health of the hive,\" he says.  NimbeLink, in partnership with The Bee Corp, has developed a hive tracking and management system by which essential data such as temperature, humidity, movement and location is collected by sensors and can then be transmitted back for analysis. The futureAt the Mobile World Congress people are already talking about the next big development, 6GOf course, just as we get our heads around what 5G can do, scientists are already working on the next big thing.It's all about Huawei. World's biggest mobile tech show gets started\"5G is good but 6G is better,\" says Ari Pouttu, a science professor at the University of Oulu, Finland. Expected to roll out in 2030, 6G will be a development beyond the smartphone. \"Let's throw the smartphones away and think about how humans interact with infrastructure,\" says Poutto. \"You can have smart surfaces with electronics in them, smart glasses so you can have devices everywhere.\"So, stay tuned",

        "content": "London (CNN Business)A growing number of companies are using virtual reality to recruit and train staff, with immersive experiences giving employers new ways to deliver training and foster empathy at work.German railway company Deutsche Bahn began using VR four years ago to attract new staff. Potential hires can wear a VR headset and \"within a matter of seconds can experience a job in a very real-life atmosphere,\" according to Kerstin Wagner, Deutsche Bahn's head of talent acquisition.VR can also help companies to pick the best people for their team. Israeli technology company Actiview has developed a recruitment platform that uses a VR interface to assess candidates. Its technology also allows employers to offer new recruits a virtual tour of their offices or a chance to virtually meet the chief executive.Using Actiview's platform, candidates participate in a puzzle-based test. \"The VR simulation allows us to control what the user sees, hears, feels. We see their behavior, and we can collect that data,\" explained Roy Elishkov, Actiview's vice president of strategy and business development. \"We can monitor their approach. Do they explore the space first, strategize? Are they mission-oriented, do they solve the puzzles in a linear order?\"Transforming the way companies trainRead MoreVR is transforming the way training is delivered. For example, the British Army recently unveiled a pilot program that will use VR to train soldiers and, since 2017, fast-food chain KFC has been using a VR game to teach staff how to cook fried chicken.VR experiences are being developed to give staff a sense of the day-to-day reality of their jobs. While the use of VR for staff training and recruitment is not yet mainstream, experts believe it will be in the future.\"VR allows the user to feel immersed in an experience, which is really useful from a skills perspective. There's a cost argument too, as it can be logistically challenging to create these training scenarios in the real world,\" said Jeremy Dalton, head of VR at consulting firm PwC UK. \"VR allows you to explore workplace scenarios and understand the impact of your choices and actions. It is also an effective tool for hands-on training, letting people perform the actions with their own hands,\" he added.According to Arturo Schwartzberg, co-founder of e-learning company SweetRush, putting on a headset and being immersed in a VR experience can help build empathy. \"You can experience what is it like to be in a wheelchair, or be the minority in the room, or to do someone else's difficult job that you never really thought about,\" he said.SweetRush worked with Hilton to develop a VR experience to give office staff a taste of the reality of running a hotel, from the front desk to housekeeping. After a successful pilot, the VR experience has been rolled out to six of Hilton's corporate offices globally.\"During the immersion, team members can walk through the hotel and participate in unique operational tasks, like setting up a room service tray,\" said Gretchen Stroud, vice president of talent, learning and engagement at Hilton. \"They are guided through the process by 'Vic' our Virtual Concierge.\"The hotel chain Hilton has adopted VR in their training. Tackling the gender pay gap? A new wave of technology companies are now looking at innovative ways to further utilize VR in the workplace. For example, Vantage Point has developed a VR-based training platform to deliver immersive anti-sexual harassment training for companies. Its training walks users through a number of situations, such as an office party where the lines between the personal and the professional are blurred, with the user choosing how to react to specific comments and actions.\"VR allows the employee to see the body language, hear the tone, experience the context of the situation,\" said Vantage Point founder Morgan Mercer said. \"Is John leaning into Sally's space when he makes a specific comment? What's his tone? Does she appear uncomfortable? Those are things you have to see, hear, feel.\"Mercer is now working on a VR program aimed at helping women develop negotiation skills in a bid to address the gender pay gap.\"It will allow you to sit across the table from your boss in a virtual negotiation, to say the words you will say, to practice and then to get a sense of your outcome versus your peers,\" she said. \"It could be incredibly impactful for gender parity.\"",

Levi's and Tommy Hilfiger are among the brands getting in on the act.Now Greek startup Tribe Wearables wants to use high-tech clothing to make your workouts more effective.The company is developing gym shorts that sense your every move, tell you how to improve your workouts and help prevent injuries.A laboratory in your shortsOnce a keen basketball player, Tribe Wearables founder Demetres Stordopoulos suffered a knee injury in 2010 during his studies at university. The computer science student was frustrated by weeks of physiotherapy exercises, unable to check whether he was healing in between check-ups with his doctor. Read MoreA trip to a biomechanics lab in 2013 inspired Stordopoulos. He wanted to take the lab's monitoring technology and put it into gym clothes. He hoped these smart garments could track the wearer's progress and health outside the lab -- at a fraction of the cost.But making a complex technology suitable for everyday use was not an easy task. The prototype was \"like a pair of shorts, a computer and an octopus had a child,\" says Stordopoulos.  Tribe Wearables clothes analyze your body's performance during exercise, using artificial intelligenceNikos Aggelousis, Tribe Wearables' lead bioengineer, admits he was skeptical at first and felt the project was too ambitious. \"The idea was to develop a wearable by putting an entire biomechanics lab on a pair of shorts, using an embedded technology that itself was under research and development,\" he said.Now, paper-thin sensors make the smart technology in the clothes almost unnoticeable.The 'living laboratory': Inside a neighborhood of smart homesEach pair of Tribe Wearables shorts contains sensors that collect data and send it to an app, which then suggests which exercises would best suit the user. It also provides virtual coaching, offering feedback and making sure that a workout is at the right level of intensity.Stordopoulos believes this technology will prevent sports injuries and give people more control over their own fitness. A smart T-shirt is also under development. Smart watches lead the way\"It's early days for smart clothing,\" says Ed Thompson, of data analytics company GlobalData. \"Only a few products are seeing the commercial light of day.\" Thompson says recent progress in areas such as smart fabrics, motion capture technology and artificial intelligence allow wearable tech companies to develop clothing for specific tasks.\"Smart clothes also have uses in the healthcare and defense sectors, where continuous monitoring of body activities is of the utmost importance,\" he adds.Would you trust an algorithm to diagnose an illness? The industry is dominated by the smart watch, which makes up 60% of the wearables market, according to GlobalData. Biochemical sensors, fall detection and heart rate monitors are becoming standard in these devices, which can also carry out smartphone functions like playing music and tracking location.Meanwhile, fitness trackers are losing popularity because they have fewer features than smart watches, GlobalData states. Aggelousis believes there is a unique opportunity for fitness technology in the multi-billion-dollar wearables market. The task is to make that technology \"unobtrusive and invisible to the user,\" he says. So the most important challenge for future fitness technology may be to make you forget you're wearing it.",

What are the traffic conditions?\" She leaves for work, checking an app on her phone that warns her if any doors or windows have been left open at home. She looks at the app two or three more times during the day to monitor the thermostat or let a delivery in. At the grocery store, she checks to see if she has enough milk, via the refrigerator's in-built camera. Kennedy is living in Reynolds Landing, a neighborhood of 62 smart homes developed by Alabama Power on the outskirts of Birmingham, Alabama. It is part of an experiment by the utility company to imagine how homes will look in 2040. With North America's smart home market expected to grow from $12 billion to $36 billion in yearly revenues between 2017 and 2022, according to market research firm Berg Insight, this experiment could foretell the future of home design. By 2022, the report estimates that 63 million households in North America will have adopted smart home systems.\"What we've done here is create some very efficient homes, connect them up, and we're trying to understand how we're serving those customers...and how they're using that energy and interacting with those devices in their homes,\" Todd Rath, Alabama Power's marketing director, tells CNN Business. Homes are powered by a microgrid located about a mile down the roadRead MoreEnergy-efficient technologyHomes at Reynolds Landing are 35% more efficient than standard newly built homes in the area, earning Alabama Power the Alliance to Save Energy's 2019 Stars of Energy Efficiency Award. The electricity that powers them is generated locally, by a microgrid made up of solar panels, battery storage and a backup natural gas generator.  The biggest energy savers are the temperature control systems, which are particularly important in Alabama's extreme climate. \"Here in the southeast United States, we have hot summers but also really cold snaps in the winter,\" says Rath. \"The biggest energy user in an individual home is the heating and air-con system.\"Homeowners can control temperature ranges in multiple zones in their home to prevent wasting energy heating or cooling unused rooms. The microgrid helps to maximize these energy savings \u2014 if it's a mild day and homes don't need as much energy, it turns on the heat pump and water heater to store excess energy for later.Each home is equipped with smart features and technology that give the residents more control Outsmarted?The houses are kitted out with a smart home system that includes thermostats, voice-activated security and interconnected kitchen appliances. This means that the homeowner can control almost everything remotely: from room temperature to opening the door and turning on the oven.Such smart devices use less energy than heating and air conditioning units, and consumers love remote control and tactile interaction, says Nick Lange, a consultant at sustainable energy company VEIC.\"The little things do add up\" he says. \"Smart thermostats are a good example of a relatively pain-free way to have a big impact.\"For some, advanced technology can be an obstacle. \"There are always moments when I feel like it's a step ahead,\" says Kennedy, especially with older people like her parents who might not have had access to technology at a younger age. \"But when they hear about the impact that we're seeing financially ... how we're using less energy and living more efficiently, I would say they are both open and interested,\" she says. The houses look like any other in the area, but the tech stands them apartLiving laboratoryHouses in the smart neighborhood came onto the market in the usual fashion, costing around $400,000 each \u2014 about average for a home in the area, says Rath. When buying a home, residents agreed to share anonymized data on energy usage with Alabama Power and meet researchers monthly to discuss their experience and likes and dislikes. \"Each of the homeowners is part of this research project, we call it the living laboratory,\" says Rath.But smart products could make homeowners less secure. A 2019 report by Avast, a cybersecurity software company, found that 40% of digital homes worldwide contained at least one device vulnerable to cyber attacks \u2014 citing printers as the most common entry point. The study suggests that the rapid growth of the Internet of Things \u2014 a system of devices and objects connected to the internet, which is predicted to more than triple by 2025 to over 75 billion devices \u2014 puts manufacturers under pressure to deliver affordable smart devices and security features can be neglected. \"A low cost smart thermostat is very open to the world, and if that's the one that is present in the market it becomes a juicy target for someone to exact ransom software,\" says Lange.\"But I think the benefits outweigh the risk,\" he adds. By 2040, both smart home technologies and the security software available will be far more sophisticated. \"What [Alabama Power] put together is a realistic example of what future homes communities are likely to have, but I can say almost certainly that those future homes will be better versions of them,\" he says.",

        "content": "New York (CNN Business)When Amazon opened a sprawling warehouse in her community in March 2020, Jennifer Bates never guessed she'd find herself testifying before members of Congress one year later about the \"grueling\" conditions she experienced working inside it. Bates, grandmother of seven, had been excited Amazon was coming to Bessemer, Alabama, because of the economic growth she thought it would bring to the area \u2014 and the possibility that a job there would allow her to spend more time with family.What she found at Amazon instead was a job with 10-hour shifts that she felt were \"more strenuous\" than the 12-hour days she pulled at a previous company. The amount of walking required to get around a warehouse the size of 14 football fields, including going up and down flights of stairs, hurt her knees and caused her legs to swell, she said. Jennifer Bates was thrust into the national spotlight after her efforts to help organize a union at the Amazon facility in Bessemer, Alabama.\"Working 10 hours at the pace that they push you to go, the time off is either going to the doctor for something, soaking, resting, taking it easy on your days off,\" Bates, an Amazon associate, said in a CNN Business interview this month.She considered quitting. But Bates determined there was a better response: fighting to improve it. \"Why couldn't I stand still and have an opportunity to fix something that was broken?\"Read MoreThat decision would ultimately thrust Bates into the national spotlight thanks to her role as part of a high-profile union push inside the Bessemer facility. The face of the fightThe workers and organizers behind the effort were fighting to create what would have been the first US-based union in Amazon's 27-year history. In the process, they rattled one of America's largest employers, which put on full display its aggressive tactics to combat unionization. More than any other Amazon worker, it was Bates who became the face of this effort, potentially risking her livelihood in the process.At the invitation of Sen. Bernie Sanders, Bates testified before the Senate Budget Committee on March 17. Speaking via Zoom, Bates appeared read damning prepared remarks. \"Amazon brags it pays workers above the minimum wage. What they don't tell you is what those jobs are really like,\" she said. \"From the onset, I learned that if I worked too slow or had too much time-off-task I could be disciplined or even fired.\" Her testimony sparked a flurry of press coverage about Amazon's warehouse conditions, with Bates' name at the center.Bates testified before a Senate Budget Committee, detailing the working conditions she said she experienced at the Bessemer warehouse.In a statement at the time, an Amazon spokesperson pushed back on her characterizations: \"We take employee feedback seriously, including Ms. Bates', but we don't believe her comments represent the more than 90% of her fulfillment center colleagues who say they'd recommend Amazon as a great place to work to friends and family.\"The risks of speaking out so publicly were substantial. \"Anytime a worker gets involved in organizing with their coworkers, they're taking a risk and Jennifer Bates has been willing to take that risk on behalf of the people she works with,\" said Rebecca Givan, an associate professor of labor studies and employment relations at Rutgers University. \"She's been willing to talk to the media, to talk to Congress, to really fight very, very publicly.\" Bates knew this from the start. \"I had to be very careful [of] how I moved, how I spoke and what I did,\" she recalled. \"What good is it if I lose my job and the work that I started is not complete?\" The election to unionize, which took place by mail due to the pandemic over a nearly two-month period ending in April, resulted in workers largely voting against a union. But whether that vote will be upheld is still an open question. The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) appealed the election, alleging that Amazon \u2014 which vigorously fought the effort \u2014 wrongfully interfered. In August, a National Labor Relations Board official recommended the results of the election be scrapped and that a new election be held due to alleged illegal misconduct by Amazon. The NLRB has yet to make its determination on the matter and Amazon has indicated it may appeal the NLRB's findings.For now the union effort continues at Bessemer \u2014 and so does Bates' sense that she might lose her job at the warehouse, where she still works, before that work is done. A long road to taking on AmazonFor a decade before she joined Amazon, Bates worked in a unionized job at a US Pipe plant. She described her colleagues there as \"more like family\" and said workers \"didn't get any disrespect\" because they had the union. That experience informed her action after she joined Amazon. It moved quickly: One day, she and a group of Amazon coworkers were secretly meeting with the RWDSU at the local Cracker Barrel about possibly organizing a union. Before long they had garnered enough interest from other Amazon employees to hold a union election at the facility, which would draw attention from prominent figures including President Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams. Amazon had long faced criticism over workplace conditions inside its warehouses, including around the rates of serious injuries. But the scrutiny grew during the pandemic as households leaned even more on its delivery services. Workers, advocacy groups and politicians sounded the alarm on everything from the backbreaking pace of work to the lack of transparency around confirmed Covid-19 cases. The union vote in Bessemer drew attention from prominent figures including President Joe Biden, Stacey Abrams and Sen. Bernie Sanders. Bates is pictured on the left.Several employees-turned-activists had pushed for Amazon to improve working conditions during the pandemic and later accused the company of retaliating against them \u2014 allegations that the company has denied. Just last month, Amazon settled with two corporate workers who claimed they were illegally fired. As part of the settlement, Amazon is required to post a notice to workers nationwide acknowledging that it cannot fire workers for organizing.\"Companies have devalued employees into thinking that [they're] not valuable ... people have begun to stand up and say, you know what? They're nothing without us.\" Jennifer BatesThere were a host of issues Bessemer workers like Bates believed could be improved with the help of union representation, including adequate break time, better procedures for filing and receiving responses to grievances, higher wages and protection against Amazon allegedly wrongfully applying policies to discipline workers who express concerns. (Amazon has repeatedly said safety is a priority and it has a \"zero tolerance for retaliation against employees who raise concerns.\")To combat the union organizing, Amazon sent numerous text messages to workers, pulled them into one-on-one meetings on the warehouse floor and, in the kickoff to the election, required them to attend group meetings every few shifts. It launched an anti-union website that warned against paying dues, and posted signage in bathroom stalls.Union supporters gathered outside of the Bessemer facility on March 29, 2021.In a statement to CNN Business earlier this year about the union effort, Amazon spokesperson Heather Knox said: \"We opened this site in March [2020] and since that time have created more than 5,000 full-time jobs in Bessemer, with average pay of $15.30 per hour, including full healthcare, vision and dental insurance, 50% 401(K) match from the first day on the job; in safe, innovative, inclusive environments, with training, continuing education, and long-term career growth.\"The aftermathAhead of her decision to be more front-and-center with the union push, Bates' mother expressed some discomfort. \"She was the only one who felt kind of, you know, leery about me pushing,\" said Bates, who added that her mom came around. \"She knows that I have that fire.\" But Bates felt the impact of her Senate testimony almost immediately. The day after, a manager informed her that she was being stripped of her ambassadorship \u2014 a role she'd enjoyed that allowed her to help train new employees in the facility. (According to recommendations from the NLRB hearing officer, \"the evidence was insufficient to establish that Bates was denied ambassador work ... because of her Union sympathies.\") \"Our employees have the choice of whether or not to join a union. They always have,\" Barbara Agrait, a spokesperson for Amazon, said in a statement in response to questions about Bates' experience, including why she lost her ambassadorship. \"As a company, we don't think unions are the best answer for our employees.\"She also felt a shift in how many colleagues viewed her: Some appeared \"frightened\" to talk to her; others said they had been informed by her speech. Even now, when she walks into the Amazon warehouse, there are times her badge temporarily doesn't scan and she thinks: \"Well, today's the day they got me.\"According to Givan, the risk associated with being a vocal workplace organizer, can also extend beyond one's current place of employment to other potential employers.The Bessemer facility where Bates continues to work.RWDSU president Stuart Appelbaum called it \"a very, very scary thing\" to speak out as Bates has done. \"You're putting yourself out there to the whole world. You're facing all the wealth and power in the universe.\"Bates, he said, \"understood the civil rights dimension of what it was that was happening in Bessemer.\" Roughly 85% of the workforce at the facility is Black and the majority are women, he said.\"For her, it is a calling,\" Appelbaum said. Bates frequently talks about her decision to speak out, and even the results of the election, on spiritual terms: \"I believe in destiny. I believe that God [does] things in His own timing and if it's part of the journey, then I'm here for it.\"The outcome of that journey so far may not be quite what Bates had in mind, but Givan said the effort has successfully drawn mainstream attention to what workers are up against when organizing.Bates, too, is hopeful about the broader effects her voice may have. \"I believe for so many years that companies have devalued employees into thinking that [they're] not valuable ... people have begun to stand up and say, you know what? They're nothing without us.\" \"We're not pushovers. There needs to be a change in this country and we're not stopping until there's a change,\" she added. \"We're still moving. We're still on fire and we're not going to stop.\"",

        "content": "New York (CNN Business)Less than a month into her role as the chief executive of Citigroup, Jane Fraser made a decision that shook Wall Street. It was late March, and signs of burnout were everywhere after more than a year of remote work in the pandemic. Deal volume was at record highs and showed no signs of letting up. Over at investment banking rival Goldman Sachs, young analysts made headlines with workplace horror stories that went beyond the typical long hours and cutthroat competition that Wall Street's known for. They were falling apart, mentally and emotionally. Fraser saw an opportunity. And the memo she sent to Citi's 210,000 global staff would set the tone for how she would try to overhaul Citigroup \u2014 long languishing in third place and mired in bad press.\"The blurring of lines between home and work and the relentlessness of the pandemic workday have taken a toll on our well-being,\" she wrote. \"It's simply not sustainable.\"Jane Fraser, pictured at the Milken Institute Global Conference in California in 2019, inherited a difficult job when she took over at Citi. She also became the first woman to lead a top American bank.What followed was a reset plan that included the kinds of work-life balance measures you don't often see on Wall Street. Fraser implemented \"Zoom-free Fridays\" and urged staff to avoid scheduling calls outside traditional work hours. Take your vacations, she pleaded. Veteran bankers must have thought they were in the Twilight Zone. Read MoreThen came the real shock: When Citi ultimately returns to the office, most roles will be designated as \"hybrid\" \u2014 with three days in office and up to two at home. Among American banks, that kind of flexibility was unheard of. It was both a humane reaction to a mass trauma and a calculated strategic decision. By branding itself the \"bank with a soul,\" as Fraser calls it, Citi would have an edge in scooping up and retaining talent that might otherwise eschew Wall Street for the less-frenzied, or at least less formal, world of tech. Fraser readily admits the decision wasn't purely about empathy \u2014 \"I want to crush the competition,\" she told Bloomberg News last month. But by not cracking the whip, she's also staking out a somewhat radical position on Wall Street: that ruthlessness doesn't have to define a bank's culture. By branding itself the \"bank with a soul,\" as Fraser calls it, Citi would have an edge in scooping up talent that might otherwise eschew Wall Street for the world of tech.Banking analysts and investors will be closely watching Fraser in March, when she plans to unveil Citigroup's cultural and structural rehabilitation plan for the next several years. It'll also mark her first full year as CEO \u2014 a timely check-in to see how her strategy is playing out. No one expects her to wave a magic wand and undo decades' worth of mismanagement overnight. But the March investor day will be a crucial early test. Shareholders are hungry for bold action. The biggest risk, says longtime banking analyst Mike Mayo, is not that the plan will be too aggressive \u2014 it's that it won't be aggressive enough. Turnaround jobIt's hard to overstate what a difficult job Fraser, the first woman to lead a top American bank, has inherited. Citigroup's (C) stock is wildly underperforming. Its shares are up about 13% this year \u2014 dismal compared with the broader stock market, which has gained 24% in 2021. Citi's rivals are outpacing it by even more: Bank of America (BAC) is up 60%, and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is up 35%.  It's also under intense pressure from regulators, who for years have been cajoling the bank to overhaul its hodgepodge of internal risk-management and data systems. Regulators' concerns aren't unfounded. In August 2020, Citi committed one of the biggest blunders in the history of Wall Street when it erroneously wired nearly $1 billion of its own money to creditors of Revlon. The fat-finger error ultimately cost Citi more than $500 million when several of those creditors refused to return the funds. Just two months later, regulators slapped Citigroup with a $400 million fine for failing to address \"long-standing deficiencies.\" As Citi employees return to their offices, including the bank's Long Island City, New York, location, most roles have been designated as \"hybrid.\" That kind of flexibility is unheard of among big American banks.Fraser's shakeup of office culture is a relatively easy win \u2014 necessary, perhaps, but far from sufficient, analysts say.\"Every day she gets a grade from shareholders, and that's the stock price,\" Mayo said in an interview with CNN Business. \"And every day that she's been in the role, the verdict is Citigroup is worth more dead than alive.\"It's not enough to change the tone at the top, Mayo said. Fraser, who declined to comment for this article, has to address the sort governance lapses that have gotten the bank in trouble. In a recent note to clients, Mayo and other analysts criticized Citi's decision to identify potential cash bonuses for top managers before their performance targets are even announced. \"That's like charging us for dinner before we know if we're getting hot dogs or caviar,\" the note said. \"Moreover, the awards are in cash vs. stock and seem like extra pay to execs for just doing their job.\"That's terrible governance, Mayo says. \"And that's the terrible governance Citigroup has had for the last 10, 20, 50 or 100 years.\"Better Call JaneThankfully for Citigroup, Fraser's no stranger to cleanup jobs. During the 2008 financial crisis, the bank very nearly collapsed because of its exposure to toxic mortgage-backed securities. As Citigroup hobbled along on life support in the form of a massive government bailout, Fraser \u2014 who joined the bank in 2004 \u2014ran its strategy division, overseeing sales of risky assets to streamline the bank's sprawling operations.She later ran Citigroup's battered mortgage business and its Latin America operations, both decidedly thorny assignments in the fallout of the financial crisis. Fraser, pictured at Citi's Brazil headquarters in 2018, was formerly CEO of the company's Latin America operations. She steered the bank through the devastation of Hurricane Maria.In a 2018 interview with CNN, Fraser recalled people telling her she was \"crazy\" for taking over CitiMortgage just a few years after the housing market imploded. In hindsight, she said, it was the \"best decision I've ever made.\"The lesson: You don't have to know everything.\"You learn from those situations... Because it was a crisis and because I didn't know anything,\" she said. \"You have to hire people that are better than you and more knowledgeable than you.\"Fraser is widely credited for cleaning up Citi's Mexican subsidiary, which was emerging from a money-laundering scandal when she became CEO of Citigroup's Latin America operations in 2015. In that role, she also steered the bank through the devastation of Hurricane Maria. When the storm forced Citi's San Juan, Puerto Rico, branch to close, she oversaw efforts to bring in generators and other necessities to get the bank back up and running a week later. \"We don't leave a country when it's in really bad shape,\" Fraser told the New York Times in an interview in February. \"We can really make a difference.\" Fraser, 54, comes to the role of CEO armed with a resume straight out of Wall Street central casting. She worked as a Goldman Sachs analyst after receiving her degree in economics at Cambridge. Then came the Harvard MBA, followed by a decade of work at consulting giant McKinsey before joining Citigroup in 2004.A 'glass cliff' moment?Fraser regularly downplays the gender question in interviews. The fact that she's a woman running a major bank is historic, but it should hardly matter as long she does the job well. And that's true. But it's also impossible to ignore Corporate America's track record of sticking a woman in the driver's seat when the wheels are about to come off. Research shows that women are more likely to be promoted to senior leadership positions when institutions are in trouble \u2014 a trend known as the glass cliff. Mary Barra, famously, made history as the first woman to run General Motors in 2014. But the automaker was a mess, still crawling out of bankruptcy and, two weeks into Barra's tenure, issuing a massive recall linked to 13 deaths that the company had known about for years. There was a similar sense of crisis at Citi that accelerated Fraser's ascension. Fraser, shown at the White House in October, took over for Michael Corbat \u2014 who wasn't supposed to retire for another year.In the fall of 2020, her predecessor Michael Corbat wasn't supposed to retire for another year. But with regulators breathing down the bank's neck over long-overdue systems upgrades, plus a flurry of bad press over the fat-finger flub, Corbat decided to bounce early, according to the Wall Street Journal. An expensive, time-consuming overhaul needed to begin right away, and Corbat \u2014 who himself was elevated to CEO in 2012 to be Mr. Fix-It \u2014 believed that process should be handled by his successor. Analysts agree Fraser's got her work cut out for her. Her 17 years at the bank, across multiple divisions, means she knows where the bodies are buried, where Citi thrives and where it lags. But, notably, says Mayo, Fraser so far hasn't brought in a heavy-hitting outsider to shake up the upper echelons of management. Allegiances to \"old\" Citigroup could be a huge liability, he says. \"The old managers, the board of directors... these are not her friends or her family, she doesn't owe anything to them. She owes something, if anything, to the shareholders that have been left woefully behind.\"",

        "content": "New York (CNN Business)Two months after former US President Donald Trump was inaugurated in 2017, Twitter (TWTR) executive Vijaya Gadde was asked how she felt about his proposition that he might not have won the White House without the social media platform. \"To me, there's nothing better than having a political discourse in plain and open view and having access to your elected officials, and being able to hold them accountable,\" Gadde, then Twitter's general counsel, told the audience at a New York University School of Law event. \"In that sense, I think it's a great thing because this wasn't always possible before.\"\"Now,\" she added, \"the consequences of that direct dialogue are unfolding in front of us and not something we could've quite predicted.\" Less than three years later, the United States faced the most troubling consequence yet: A group of rioters attacked Capitol Hill on January 6 after Trump spent weeks using social media platforms to agitate his base and spread a lie that the 2020 election had been stolen. Gadde, who by then had become head of legal, policy and trust at Twitter, found herself at the center of deciding whether to take the unprecedented step of banning Trump from Twitter.  Read MoreTwitter's head of legal, policy and trust Vijaya Gadde has been at the center of many of the company's major decisions, including banning Donald Trump.Two days later, Twitter permanently banned Trump, citing a \"risk of further incitement of violence.\" The move was praised by civil rights advocates who called on Facebook and YouTube to follow Twitter's lead \u2014 while others said the move should have come much sooner. Facebook (FB) had blocked Trump's accounts \"indefinitely\" a day earlier, a suspension that was upheld in May by the company's court-like Oversight Board and is up for review again in November. Google-owned YouTube announced a suspension of Trump's channel a week later but has left the door open for him to return to the platform. Twitter's decision to remove Trump didn't happen immediately. The platform initially banned Trump for 12 hours on January 6. Twitter took heat when it let him back on and he quickly tweeted again, calling his followers who stormed the Capitol \"patriots.\" The Washington Post detailed a January 8 meeting in which Gadde made an \"impassioned appeal\" for staffers to have patience as her team deliberated what to do. Hours later, Twitter banned Trump permanently. Multiple outlets reported that Gadde played a central role in the Trump ban decision. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was reportedly vacationing on a private island at the time. (Twitter has said Dorsey was closely involved in the decision.) Asked this month about her role in banning Trump, a Twitter spokesperson told CNN Business: \"Policy enforcement decisions are made by our Trust and Safety team, which report to Vijaya Gadde.\" The spokesperson also said Twitter has \"no plans to reinstate\" Trump's account.\"Vijaya is at the crossroads of some of the most important policy decisions the company is making and how it interacts with governments around the world.\" Former Twitter COO Adam BainThe Trump ban marked the boldest \u2014 and riskiest \u2014 decision in the tech firm's 15-year history: cutting off a sitting world leader and its most high-profile user who had amassed nearly 89 million followers and driven massive attention to the platform. Not only did the ban risk pushback from Trump and regulators, it set a tough new standard for the company to live by in other countries. It also kicked off a larger debate about whether \"deplatforming\" actually works to prevent potential harms from social media platforms. But the decision also highlighted the disproportionate impact that Twitter, and Gadde, can have within the tech industry despite its comparatively small audience and resources.\"It forced the hand of competitors like Facebook and like Google's YouTube, which are much bigger companies in scale,\" said Katie Paul, director of the nonprofit research organization Tech Transparency Project. \"[Banning Trump] was an important moment for the company's really setting a line and showing that they do have the power to shut down these things.\" Now Twitter is facing similarly thorny questions in other major democracies around the world, including conflicts with governments in India and Nigeria. Gadde will likely be heavily involved in resolving these issues, too.\"Vijaya is at the crossroads of some of the most important policy decisions the company is making and how it interacts with governments around the world ... and how Twitter is thinking through the trust and safety of its platform,\" Adam Bain, Twitter's former COO who worked closely with Gadde before leaving the company in 2016, told CNN Business. \"It's an extremely important job at the company.\" Twitter announced the pernament ban of then-US President Donald Trump on January 8, 2021. A 'steady hand' at TwitterGadde immigrated to the United States from India with her parents in the 1970s and grew up on the Gulf Coast of Texas. After attending Cornell University for industrial and labor relations and then NYU School of Law, she spent a decade working in corporate law. She was inspired by her aunt, one of India's first female lawyers, she told the NYU audience.She joined Twitter in 2009, three years after it launched, motivated in part by her father-in-law in Egypt who had begun using Twitter as the country's pro-democracy movement started to brew. Gadde first helped run the corporate legal department, playing a role in Twitter's acquisitions and its 2013 IPO. That year, she became general counsel.  Twitter is known for some volatility, with three CEOs during Gadde's tenure. But inside Twitter, she has been \"an extremely steady hand\" and \"the type of leader that people love working for and with,\" according to Bain. \"What she's focused on is making the right decisions based on facts and the right process. She doesn't predicate the outcome.\"Beyond that, Bain said, she believes Twitter should be \"as open\" as possible with the world to \"build trust,\" as evidenced by her pushing for the company's biannual transparency reports. Twitter declined to make Gadde available for this story.Inside Twitter, Gadde is \"an extremely steady hand,\" according to a former executive who worked closely with her. While Twitter is much bigger now than when Gadde joined, its audience and market cap remain less than a tenth the size of Facebook. Yet the two companies are often mentioned in the same breath given Twitter's outsized importance shaping media and politics. And as Twitter's influence has grown, so has Gadde's. She's met with lawmakers and regulators around the globe, including Trump in 2019. Gadde and her team may also be more empowered to make big moves at Twitter than she would be at other tech firms because of its smaller size.\"It means they have smaller teams and fewer lobbying dollars to work with,\" said Marietje Schaake, international policy director at Stanford University's Cyber Policy Center and a former European Parliament member focused on trade and technology policies.  \"From my experience, the company has been more open to taking proactive steps in their own policies.\"Gadde's next battles Within six months, Twitter went from banning one president to being banned after taking action on another. The company was forced offline in Nigeria in June after taking down a controversial tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari, a ban that remains in place. Twitter has said it will \"continue to engage\" with the Nigerian government, but the company's relatively muted stance has puzzled activists in the country.\"They've been surprisingly quiet,\" said Gbenga Sesan, executive director of the pan-African digital rights group Paradigm Initiative. \"This would have been a good time to, you know, take a categorical stand.\" Meanwhile, taking a stand has put Twitter on a knife edge between its principles and its business in one of its most important global markets: India.Twitter is a mess in India. Here's how it got thereThe company sparked a conflict there in February by taking down hundreds of accounts at the government's behest but refusing to take action against journalists, activists and politicians, resulting in an uneasy stalemate that has now dragged on for months. India passed new technology rules making social media companies liable for what users post on their platforms and requiring each company to appoint designated compliance officials in the country.  Twitter has sent mixed signals, initially pushing back and expressing concerns about a \"potential threat to freedom of speech\" but subsequently pledging to meet the new requirements. Some Indian tech advocates have described it as baffling and said this makes it harder to defend Twitter against what many see as overreach by the Indian government. Twitter is fully compliant with India's rules and \"remains committed to safeguarding the voices and privacy of those using our service,\" the company spokesperson said. \"Twitter leadership, including Vijaya, are continuing to engage in productive dialogue around these issues \u2014 and similar issues around the world.\"Gadde has cautioned against suing the government, as Facebook-owned WhatsApp has done. She referred to litigation as a \"blunt tool\" at a virtual digital rights conference in June. \"It's a very delicate balance to draw when you want to actually be in court, versus when you want to negotiate and try to make sure that the government understands the perspective that you're bringing,\" Gadde said. \"Because I do think you can lose a lot of control when you end up in litigation.\" Among Gadde's next battles are challenges by foreign governments who want to exert control over the platform. Twitter's position in India remains precarious. Its presence there is much smaller than rivals like YouTube, Facebook and its subsidiary WhatsApp, which have hundreds of millions of Indian users, often making Twitter a convenient scapegoat. \"If the [Indian government] were to go out and shut down WhatsApp, that would cause a significant backlash from the general public,\" said Bhaskar Chakravorti, dean of global business at The Fletcher School at Tufts University. \"But shut down Twitter? Not as much.\"There's also more at stake for Twitter. Both India and Nigeria are among the world's largest and fastest-growing internet user bases. The way Gadde's team and Twitter resolve its challenges in those countries could have big implications for the company's growth and the future of the internet, according to Paul of the Tech Transparency Project.  \"This is something that's certainly going to be watched globally and [will be] the model for how companies deal with it moving forward,\" she said.",

        "content": "New York (CNN Business)There was a moment last year, as Covid-19 brought the entire planet to a standstill, when the chef and owner of one of the world's most renowned and expensive restaurants thought he might lose everything.Daniel Humm's restaurant, Eleven Madison Park, has three Michelin stars and had recently topped the World's 50 Best Restaurants list. But like so many other less famous restaurants during the pandemic, it had to lay off all its employees, was struggling to pay its vendors and was facing the once-unthinkable prospect of filing for bankruptcy.\"At times I thought, well, if we're going bankrupt with Eleven Madison Park, maybe that's the end of a chapter,\" Humm told CNN in an interview in August. \"I actually got to the place where I was comfortable with that idea. I mean, you have to.\"Humm came to find the idea liberating, he said. Like many others before him he had previously concluded the food system required less meat consumption to be sustainable long-term. So if he might lose the restaurant anyway, why not take a chance?That thinking laid the groundwork for a decision that shocked the food world: In early May, Humm announced that when Eleven Madison park reopened the following month it would go completely plant-based. (The only exception, he said at the time, would be cow's milk as an add-on for coffee or tea.)Read MoreThe menu -\u2014 which includes items like a vegan caviar service made from tonburi, roasted eggplant with coriander and sesame tofu with squash \u2014 is all served with the signature flair and detail that Eleven Madison Park is known for. Like others before him, Daniel Humm had concluded the food system required less meat in order to be sustainable.But the move comes with significant risks. By going meatless, Humm is potentially shrinking his customer base to a smaller niche of diners.  And those diners currently have cheaper options among other vegan or vegan-friendly fine-dining establishments in New York.Amanda Cohen of Dirt Candy, for example, has been creating plant-based fine dining since 2008, with a tasting menu that runs for $130 per person including wine. Daniel Boulud opened his \"vegetable-forward and seafood centric\" restaurant Le Pavillon earlier this year, and a six-course vegetarian tasting menu is $155. Humm, however, didn't cut the price when cutting the meat. EMP's prix-fixe menu is still $335 per person \u2014 more if you add wine to the tab.Reputation matters a lot for a restaurant like EMP, which is in a tier that relies on staying buzzy. In a pre-Covid-19 world, it was the kind of restaurant people traveled thousands of miles for after working hard to cinch a notoriously difficult reservation. Since the reopening diners have largely been New Yorkers, but that is unlikely to be the case long-term once travel picks up again. The question is whether the new menu can keep up the appeal and the hype that's critical to EMP's survival.The reviews so far \u2014 including a scathing piece from the New York Times' Pete WellsThe early reviews of the new EMP have largely not been positive. Some have even been downright scathing. \"This $1,000 dinner for two is not going to change the world. It is not a redefining of luxury, or anything close to it,\" Eater's Ryan Sutton wrote in September. \"Omnivores have long been seeking out accessible yet ambitious vegetarian and vegan fare, and Humm, based on a mid-August meal, doesn't yet appear to fully possess the palate, acumen, or cultural awareness to successfully manipulate vegetables or, when necessary, to let them speak for themselves.\"One of the items on the new vegan Eleven Madison Park menu: tonburi with pea cream and baby lettuce.New York Times critic Pete Wells' review last month went viral for its withering lines, including one about an EMP beet tasting like \"a cross between lemon Pledge and a burning joint.\" Beyond his problems with the food itself, Wells also pointed out that people who have environmental concerns about meat may not have much reason to celebrate EMP's move. \"People tend to think of factory farms and feedlots when they hear about meat and sustainability. But Eleven Madison Park didn't buy industrial pork for its compressed brick of suckling pig. As the servers were always reminding you in the old days, the pork, eggs, cheese and other animal products came from small, independent regional farms...If every restaurant that supports sustainable local agriculture followed Mr. Humm's new path, those small farms would be in deep trouble,\" he wrote. At times I thought, well, if we're going bankrupt with Eleven Madison Park, maybe that's the end of a chapter. I actually got to the place where I was comfortable with that idea.\" Daniel HummAnd, importantly, he noted that through the end of this year, EMP still offers a meat option for customers who book a private dining room, a \"metaphor for Manhattan, where there's always a higher level of luxury, a secret room where the rich eat roasted tenderloin while everybody else gets an eggplant canoe.\"Wells did note that EMP has a history of correcting itself, however: \"Each time the restaurant has overhauled itself \u2014 the cryptic grid menu, the magic tricks at the table, the themed New York City menu \u2014 it has gone overboard, then pulled back to a less extreme place,\" he said, adding that \"its talent for overcoming its own missteps was one reason I gave it four stars in its last review in The New York Times, in 2015.\"A spokesperson for EMP would not comment on Wells' and Sutton's critiques, noting it is restaurant policy to not comment on reviews. The spokesperson confirmed the restaurant's decision to offer meat in the private room in a statement. Humm and his staff have faced some scathing reviews of the new Eleven Madison Park.\"It is an incredible undertaking to reopen a restaurant, especially in the midst of a rapidly evolving pandemic, and it took the entirety of our staff's focus and efforts to execute this at the level Eleven Madison Park operates,\" the statement said. \"Our intention was always to transition the private dining room to be fully plant-based as well. In early September, we made the decision to remove the last remaining animal products from the private dining room menus by January 1, 2022.\"Taking a cue from TeslaOthers say Humm deserves some credit for his decision to go meatless. \"The problem is [Humm's] going plant-based creates a narrative of novelty and freshness and vision on his part when there have already been chefs going in this direction who haven't gotten this attention,\" Alicia Kennedy, a writer who has written extensively about vegan and vegetarian food, told CNN. Still, Humm's move has significance because of his place in the industry \u2014 similar to how a top luxury fashion designer refusing to use leather or fur still has meaning even now, Kennedy said.\"If Daniel Humm making this choice has influence on chefs who look up to him ... then it is serving a really good purpose,\" Kennedy said. If it trickles down even further, to neighborhood suburban spots, that's even better, she said.As for Humm, he said he felt EMP could do with food what Tesla accomplished with cars. The dining room at Eleven Madison Park on the night it reopened, June 10, 2021.  \"It was only really until Tesla created an electric luxury car that they made it sexy,\" he said. \"They made it luxurious. They made it beautiful. And so it took that for the whole world to change. And I thought of having this similar responsibility of this restaurant that we actually were in a very unique position. Most restaurants don't have the luxury to make that kind of risky move.\"That doesn't address the question of whether a meatless menu will keep people coming through EMP's doors in the long run. But Humm said in August that the wait list was massive, with \"15,000 table requests at one time.\"Reservations for Eleven Madison Park have continued to sell out the morning they are released, a spokesperson said. Since it reopened, the restaurant has been serving roughly the same number of tables as it did prior to the pandemic, but in total, it's serving far fewer people: It's now open for dinner only six nights a week, and before, it served dinner nightly and lunch three times a week. When asked to elaborate on other metrics like sales and profitability, the spokesperson said EMP does not share financial information.Humm, as ever, is focused on the food. And he has remained optimistic that a vegan EMP can be successful.\"I think it's the best cooking we've ever done,\" Humm said. \"By a long shot.\"",

        "content": "New York (CNN Business)Derek Jeter had a problem. In 2020, his third year as chief executive and part-owner of the Miami Marlins, the team broke their long streak of missing the playoffs. But after the team had traded away nearly every big-name player on its roster in recent years, he was looking at rebuilding the Marlins from the bottom up \u2014 with a limited budget. The Marlins had also recently parted ways with its head of baseball operations. When it came time to hire a new general manager, however, Jeter knew exactly whom to call: Kim Ng. As the Yankees' assistant GM from 1998 to 2001, she worked with Jeter during three straight World Series-winning seasons.\"When we decided to make a change, Kim was the first person I called,\" Jeter told the Today Show. \"She was the only person I called.\" Ng had been waiting for that call for a decade. She had 30 years of experience in Major League Baseball, including with two of the winningest teams in the league: the Yankees and the Los Angeles Dodgers. She had also interviewed for other GM roles at least five times, but hadn't yet been offered the job. When she was hired by the Marlins in an announcement made last November, Ng became the first-ever woman GM \u2014 not only in professional baseball, but in the four major American men's sports \u2014 and the second person of Asian descent to become an MLB GM. Read MoreMiami Marlins hire Kim Ng as general manager. She's the first woman and first Asian American GM in MLB historyNg faces not only trying to turn a team with a long history of struggles into a winning franchise, but also working under a different kind of scrutiny than her male peers.\"She's really going to be under the microscope more than a first-time male GM,\" said Bob Dorfman, sports business expert and creative director at Pinnacle Advertising. What's more, the Marlins are \"budgetarily challenged \u2014 they have the lowest payroll in baseball or close to it. They have about the lowest attendance in baseball and they have a team of mostly no-names.\"Taking over during the Covid-19 pandemic, which has hurt attendance revenues across the league and occasionally forced players off the field, adds yet another complicating factor. \"When Derek told me I got the job, there was a 10,000 pound weight lifted off of [one] shoulder \u2014 and then about a half an hour later, I realized that it had just been transferred to [the other] shoulder,\" Ng said during the first press conference following her hiring. \"You're bearing the torch for so many and that is a big responsibility.\"But, she added: \"I take it on.\"Miami Marlins CEO Derek Jeter says Kim Ng was his first and only call when his team needed a new general manager. Three decades of experienceNg's interest in baseball began while playing stickball in the street as a child growing up in Queens, New York. She later played college softball at the University of Chicago, where she majored in public policy and wrote her senior thesis on Title IX, the 1972 law that gave more women access to college sports, according to the university. After graduating in 1990, Ng took an internship with the Chicago White Sox and ascended to assistant director of baseball operations. In 1997, she went briefly to the American League Office before becoming assistant GM for the Yankees and later worked as the Dodgers' assistant GM from 2002 to 2011.Working for two top teams, Ng said, gave her the experience needed to transform a consistently low-performing franchise.\"I got to see what winning at a high, high level for an extended period of time looked like, and what that took,\" Ng said in last November's press conference. The Marlins declined to make Ng and Jeter available for this story. During her time at the Dodgers, she interviewed for the team's GM role and later for the same position with four other teams. Sometimes when she got calls about interviewing for these roles, Ng felt she was there more to fill a diversity quota than for a genuine shot at the job, she told Sports Illustrated earlier this year. She also told the Today Show she suspects she was sometimes passed over because she's a woman. In 2011, she joined MLB's central office as SVP of baseball operations \u2014 until she got the call from Jeter.\"This has been too long in coming,\" Michael Brady, Florida State University marketing professor and former pitcher in the Dodgers' minor league system, said of Ng's hiring. Critics' often argue women don't play pro baseball. But Brady said with many current GMs having no experience beyond high school baseball, \"I think she has better experience being a college softball player than roughly half of the guys who are general managers now.\"Kim Ng's first assistant general manager job was with the New York Yankees where, she says, she learned what 'winning at a high, high level' took. Ng's next challengeAt less than a year as GM, Ng is experiencing the challenges of reviving the Marlins: This season, the team is ranked second-to-last in its division and will again miss playoffs after finally making it back last year. After a series of injuries contributed to a decline in the team's performance in June, Ng told reporters: \"Our depth is being challenged.\"The Marlins are also plagued by legacy issues that have shrunk its fanbase and made it an unappealing destination for top players. After joining the league in 1993 as an expansion team, it won World Series championships in 1997 and 2003, but following both wins, it traded away players key to clinching those titles.\"After they do well, they don't reinvest in their top players, and really try to approach their roster with a small budget,\" Brady said. Although those decisions weren't made by the team's current ownership, the reputation has stuck. It's made players wary of joining the team only to have their careers cut short even if they achieve success, Brady said. And it burned fans who invested in tickets to watch a winning hometown team, only to see its performance nosedive. Jeter, who took over as part of a new ownership group in 2017, has said he hopes to build a more sustainable Marlins.There's little room to make errors that many other men make as a normal part of the learning process, and at the same time, you have to be friendly and you've got a responsibility as a role model.\"Justine Siegal, the MLB's first woman coach, on being a female pioneer in baseballThe Marlins' disappointing record compounds another challenge for maintaining its fanbase: Florida is a famously difficult market for MLB teams, partly because many residents are transplants from other states, Brady said. So the Marlins have struggled to bring in fan-based revenue, including ticket, merchandise and parking sales, plus potentially lucrative television contracts. While GMs typically focus on baseball operations, Ng has already indicated that her turnaround plan will involve working closely with the business side of the franchise, something experts say is essential for growing the team's payroll and attracting top talent. \"From a business perspective, I want to be out there more in the community,\" Ng said. \"I want the Marlins to be seen as a pillar of the community, so I will be out there at different functions, to make sure that people understand who we are and where we're going.\"Attracting promising young players is also crucial to building a championship-caliber team, baseball experts say. And there's some hope: The team has one of the top-rated minor league systems and a roster of talented young players. Ng has made it clear player development is a top priority.As the first woman general manager in the MLB, Kim Ng has said she hopes to show other women that they can pursue successful careers in pro baseball. Making history as the first woman GMIn that first press conference following her hiring, it took 45 minutes for reporters to ask Ng about her strategy for the Marlins. In between queries about her perseverance through her long career, her mentors and her upbringing, she fielded a variety of questions about children, especially young girls. Specifically, she was asked how she feels about inspiring them, how they inspire her, what she would say to them and so on. While Ng \u2014 who has spent countless hours advocating for women and working to expand opportunities for girls in baseball \u2014 answered all of the questions graciously, it was a reminder that women who reach the top of male-dominated fields don't get to just be good at their jobs. Justine Siegal, who in 2015 was hired as the first woman to coach in the MLB for the Oakland Athletics, said she experienced as much when pursuing coaching jobs. \"I would do an interview, and they would never ask me a question about pitching,\" Siegal, who also founded girls baseball nonprofit Baseball for All, told CNN Business. \"It was always: 'How do you think the players will react to you?' ... 'Where will you change [your clothes]?'\"She added: \"Being a woman, being a pioneer, is exhausting. Not only do you have to be excellent all the time, there's little room to make errors that many other men make as a normal part of the learning process. At the same time you have to be friendly and you've got a responsibility as a role model.\" Ng has a legion of other trailblazing women rooting her on. Among the people who sent notes of congratulations following her hiring were tennis legend Billie Jean King, former first lady Michelle Obama and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg. She also has the support of her four sisters and mother Virginia Cagar, who told the New York Times last year: \"You go, girl. Show them boys how it's done.\"The tides in baseball appear to be turning, too. A record 23 women are coaching in the MLB this season, with many others represented in front offices and other key roles. In addition to Ng, Caroline O'Connor, the Marlins' chief operating officer, is among the highest-ranking women in the MLB. Ng plans to make good use of the diversity that Jeter has built into the Marlins organization, she said: \"It's with that diversity of experience and background that we're looking to build a championship-caliber club here in Miami.\"",

        "content": "Hong Kong (CNN Business)Cheng Wei built a world-class ride-hailing app that not even Uber could keep up with in China. But Didi's risky play for expansion and dominance \u2014 culminating in a disastrous IPO this summer \u2014 has caused it to run afoul of Beijing. And now, the company's top executive faces a difficult balancing act: placating regulators at home and investors abroad, while fending off fierce competition.Cheng, 38, who also goes by Will Cheng, is the youngest entrepreneur heading one of China's biggest tech firms. He's been busy in the nine years since Didi was founded: Cheng has knocked out a flurry of powerful opponents and amassed nearly 160 million monthly active users by the first quarter of this year in China alone, nearly double the amount of users that Uber has worldwide.Cheng pushed forward with a US IPO despite indications that Beijing was unhappy.But the ride-hailing behemoth is now in a precarious spot. It's one of the most prominent targets of China's sweeping crackdown on tech and private enterprise that has no end in sight. Its stock has fallen more than 40% since regulators began probing the company, erasing $34 billion in market value.Earlier this summer, Chinese regulators banned Didi from app stores as part of an investigation into its data privacy and collection practices, threatening its future growth. The pressure could dismantle Didi's stranglehold on the Chinese market unless the company can appease the ruling Chinese Communist Party.Read MoreDidi declined to make Cheng available for an interview, and the company did not respond to questions about Cheng or its business.JUST WATCHEDBeijing's master plan behind China's tech crackdownReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBeijing's master plan behind China's tech crackdown 03:10A swift and explosive riseBefore he founded Didi in 2012, Cheng was a sales manager at Alibaba. Starting as an entry-level salesperson making the equivalent of about $200 a month, he rose quickly and in seven years became the company's youngest regional manager. Cheng said he created Didi because he was fed up with being unable to get a taxi during a business trip, according to a profile  published in June in the Business Times, a Chinese financial news outlet. The \"pain\" led him to think about how to fix the problem.\"I was thinking, how about creating a ride-hailing app, so there can be fewer poor losers that get soaked in the rain?\" Cheng said, recalling a depressing experience in Beijing when he couldn't hail a cab for hours during a storm, according to the media outlet.Cheng founded Didi with just 100,000 yuan (roughly $15,000) of his own money, and another 700,000 yuan (roughly $110,000) from Wang Gang, an angel investor who supervised Cheng during his tenure at Alibaba. Wang's initial investment was worth a billion dollars when Didi went public.Didi learned to navigate the regulatory gray zone for ride-hailing services in China.Like its tech peers Baidu (BIDU), Alibaba (BABA) and Tencent (TCEHY), Didi's rise has been swift. When Cheng founded Didi, ride-hailing was still a regulatory gray area in China and taxis controlled the market. Cab shortages were common, as government-approved taxi operators lobbied to limit the supply of licenses. That fueled a boom in ride-hailing apps like Didi. Unlike traditional taxis, ride-hailing companies don't require expensive and difficult-to-obtain licenses for cars or drivers. Before the industry was regulated five years ago, many cities accused ride-hailing apps like Didi of running illegal taxi businesses. Didi argued that it was only providing a platform to connect passengers with cars owned by rental agencies or other third parties.Didi had learned to navigate this gray zone. It even reimbursed drivers for the penalties authorities imposed on them for breaking local laws, to keep Didi drivers on the road and retain customers.\"Reform and innovation always come with a cost,\" Cheng and company president Jean Liu wrote in a letter to employees.\nChina's central government at the time encouraged rapid innovation, and ride-hailing was never explicitly banned in China. And on July 28, 2016, ride-hailing was finally legalized in China. Days later, Didi acquired Uber China.In a letter to employees after buying his \"great rival,\" Cheng and company president Jean Liu hailed the legalization as a \"milestone.\" They said the company's service had been suspended more than 30 times in various places, and that \"countless drivers\" had their cars detained and were fined \u2014 but added that the country had finally embraced the \"dawn of reform.\"\"Reform and innovation always come with a cost,\" they wrote. \"The revolution of smart travel has just begun... [We want to] create a world-class tech company!\"After 2016, Didi continued to cement its command over Chinese ride-hailing, and by 2018 controlled 90% of the Chinese market. That year, the company expanded to Australia, Brazil and Mexico as it set its sights on customers outside of its home country.Its rapid ascent included controversy, however. In 2018, two women passengers were killed by drivers working for Hitch, forcing Didi to suspend operations at its car-pooling offshoot. The killings led to government pressure on Didi to share real-time data with authorities about its vehicles and drivers, an arrangement the company had long resisted. In late 2018, it finally made concessions.Trouble with regulatorsThat pressure foreshadowed Didi's troubles this year. Beijing has taken a sharp turn against internet firms that it fears have grown too big and powerful, resulting in a massive clampdown that has affected tech, education, entertainment and other industries. Under President Xi Jinping, the Communist Party is moving aggressively to rein in unfettered private enterprise and send a clear signal that Chinese organizations must work in lockstep with the government. Companies that have grown too big too quickly will be kept in check to ensure they are aligned with the government's priorities.Didi ran into trouble as it pushed ahead with a $4.4 billion initial public offering in New York, apparently despite evidence Beijing was unhappy. Regulators had expressed concerns about data security and suggested Didi delay its listing, according to Bloomberg.Cheng went ahead, but like other Didi executives he kept a low profile during the IPO that fell on the eve of the 100th anniversary of China's Communist Party. He didn't ring the opening bell or broadcast the news on the company's Chinese social media accounts.Cheng and DIdi's other executives kept a low profile during the company's US IPO, skipping the bell-ringing fanfare altogether.Just days later, the Cyberspace Administration of China banned Didi from app stores, preventing the company from signing up any new users. The internet watchdog accused the company of illegally collecting and mishandling user data \u2014 a trove of locations and routes containing sensitive information about Chinese traffic, roads and citizens.\"From the government's perspective, Didi has become too big to control. Obviously it wants to limit Didi's growth in China,\" said Tu Le, founder and managing director for Beijing-based consultancy Sino Auto Insights. \"The government also wants to make an example of Didi that no one can be out of the step with the Party.\"Didi also faces anger and suspicion from investors abroad. American lawmakers and investors have called on the US Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate Didi's IPO fiasco. Eurasia Group analysts said such demands \"will at the very least intensify political pressure\" on the regulator to enforce a recent law that prevents companies that refuse to open their books to US accounting officials from trading on US stock exchanges.To many analysts, Cheng's decision to press on with the IPO appeared confusing or reckless.  \"No Chinese company can openly challenge the Chinese Communist Party and expect leniency,\" said Alex Capri, a research fellow at the Hinrich Foundation. \"[Didi] is too big and too powerful for its own good and its has already crossed a threshold with China's leadership.\"The company may have had some justification in the form of investor pressure to list the company, as it had raised billions of dollars from venture capitalists. Another reason for urgency was a new data security law taking effect in September that requires all Chinese entities to obtain government approval before providing China-based data to foreign judicial or law enforcement agencies, according to Winston Ma, an adjunct professor at the New York University School of Law.A 'cutthroat market'Didi still operates in China, since users who downloaded the app before July's ban have access, and the company insists that it maintains \"normal operations globally.\" But hundreds of apps are racing to take advantage of Didi's struggles and chip away at its market lead by aggressively expanding, advertising and offering steep discounts.Old Didi rival Meituan, for example, revived its standalone ride-hailing app after Didi was removed from stores, offered coupons to new users and exempted new drivers from commission fees for a week. Other services backed by Alibaba and Geely Auto also advertised cash incentives or coupons. \"This is a cutthroat market,\" said Tu of Sino Auto Insights. \"Everyone wants to get into this multi-billion industry, including traditional car manufacturers.\" Hundreds of rivals are trying to grab market share away from Didi offering major discounts and spending lots of money on advertising.Still, Tu said, rivals are unlikely to threaten Didi's dominance entirely. He pointed out Didi has spent tens of billions to acquire customers, and that ride-hailing a tough business to tackle without a lot of financing since customers aren't typically loyal to a brand if someone else can undercut their prices. Initial government data suggested that Didi's existing business didn't take a hit after the ban, even if it couldn't register new users. The company processed 13% more orders in July than it did in June, according to China's Ministry of Transport.\"The government just wants a healthier market, not killing Didi,\" Tu said, adding that he expected Didi to survive, albeit with a \"less bold\" expansion plan.Capri, the Hinrich Foundation research fellow, was less optimistic about Didi's future \u2014 particularly for as long as it keeps trading in the United States. \"Parts of could be nationalized,\" he said. \"Beijing will also actively fund smaller competitors to even out the market and more easily exert control over the main players.\"\"The longer it stays listed on the US market,\" he added, \"the more ire it will draw from Beijing.\"",

        "content": "New York  (CNN Business)At a time when many investors are content to follow the crowd and buy top techs like Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, Cathie Wood is looking for the next big innovators in buzzy fields like robotics, fintech and space exploration. It's a high-flying, high-risk, high-reward tier of investing. And it's put Wood's fans on a white-knuckle ride in 2021.Last year, Wood's strategy paid huge dividends for investors in her flagship Ark Innovation (ARKK) exchange-traded fund. It surged nearly 150% in 2020 and helped turn her into a Wall Street superstar \u2014 sort of the Warren Buffett of momentum investing.Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Investment Management, has become the face of the growth stock movement on Wall Street.But this year hasn't been nearly as kind to Wood as the last. The Innovation ETF was down 2.5% through late August, despite a red-hot market for tech with the Nasdaq up more than 18% so far in 2021. Wood wasn't available to comment for this story, but she doubled down in an interview with CNBC in August. She's not worried that the Ark strategy of looking for new tech leaders will end badly, and she maintains that this current rally will not be a repeat of the epic 2000 dot-com implosion.Read More\"I don't think we're in a bubble, which is what I think many bears think we are,\" Wood told CNBC. \"We have nothing like that right now. In fact, you see a lot of IPOs or SPACs coming out and falling to Earth. We couldn't be further away from a bubble.\" How Wood developed her strategyWood speaks from experience. She's no millennial or Gen Z investor for whom the 2000 tech implosion is merely a war story told by older traders. The 65-year-old Wood lived through the last major tech crash, as well as the infamous Black Monday of 1987. She worked for Prudential-owned money manager Jennison Associates for 18 years in the 1980s and 1990s and then spent a dozen years at AllianceBernstein before leaving in 2013. \"I have been watching disruptive innovation for my entire career \u2014 why don't I help my own sector along?\" But then, AllianceBernstein passed on her idea to launch a suite of actively managed exchange-traded funds. So she struck out on her own and started Ark in 2014.\"I have been watching disruptive innovation for my entire career \u2014 why don't I help my own sector along?\" she told Forbes in a 2014 interview. That focus on disruption means Wood ties her ETF's fortunes to visionary but mercurial leaders. In the most prominent example, Wood remains an unabashed fan of Tesla (TSLA) and CEO Elon Musk. The EV maker is the top stock, by far, in Ark's Innovation ETF, accounting for more than 10% of the fund's holdings. It's also the biggest position in Ark's Autonomous Technology & Robotics (ARKQ) and Next Generation Internet (ARKW) ETFs. Wood is a vocal fan of Tesla, which is a top holding in several of Ark's funds.Wood is also OK with companies like Tesla issuing more stock to raise money to fund futuristic projects like autonomous vehicles. Some investors are wary of that strategy because the new shares lower the value of existing investors' holdings, but she thinks that's a short-sighted argument, particularly from Tesla bears.\"We're not afraid of dilution ... if we think they're doing it for the right reason,\" she told CNBC. \"We wanted them to scale as quickly as possible because we think if we're right on autonomous ...Tesla could get the lion's share of that market, certainly in the United States.\"You don't have to be rich to cash in on the space raceArk's big investment in Tesla is a bet on Musk continuing to innovate beyond the business of electric cars, Wood explained in an interview with Bloomberg Radio in August. She raved about Tesla's plans to build a humanoid robot, for example. \"Every passing day, especially the more we learn about their AI expertise and how they're really driving the space ... we believe they have the pole position,\" she said, noting that Ark analysts were \"blown away\" by Musk's presentation. Growth at all costsWood recognizes her growth-at-all-costs way of investing is not for everyone. Tesla has lagged the broader market this year. Shares of Teladoc (TDOC), a telehealth company that is the second-largest holding in the Ark Innovation ETF and was a big winner at the start of the pandemic, are down more than 25% in 2021. \"We've seen higher-valuation stocks hit hard this year. But the growth for these innovative companies will still be treated well over time,\" Wood said during a webcast hosted by Cboe Global Markets in March.Wood added that she thinks investors also should put a small percentage of their money in bitcoin, another risky bet. And she stressed that investors have to overlook the inevitable short-term bumps that come with any asset. It's essential to maintain longer-term convictions and invest for future growth, Wood believes. JUST WATCHEDInvestment manager: Worries about China are overdoneReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHInvestment manager: Worries about China are overdone 02:31\"A lot of companies catering to short-term investors who wanted profits now [have] invested more in stock buybacks and dividends over innovation,\" she said. \"That puts them in harm's way.\"A colleague describes Wood's go-big-or-go-home approach as a model for the new way of investing. Too many fund managers are afraid to look far into the future when judging a company's merits, instead focusing myopically on the prior and next quarterly earnings reports.\u00a0\u00a0\"Cathie has been focusing on Tesla for a long time. She looks at it not just as an automobile manufacturer. You can't compare it to traditional car companies,\"\u00a0Ark Invest's Ren Leggi, who works closely with Wood on investment decisions as the company's client portfolio manager, told CNN Business in March.  Wood's criticsBut a growing chorus of skeptics think Wood's funds could eventually collapse. Michael Burry, one of the super-bearish investors made famous in \"The Big Short,\" recently established a short position on the Ark Innovation ETF \u2014 essentially betting that it will fall sharply.Some tech stock veterans also wonder if Wood is just an investing flavor of the month, comparing her to once-popular portfolio managers like Kevin Landis of Firsthand Funds, Alberto Vilar of Amerindo and Garrett Van Wagoner, who ran a popular emerging-growth fund in the late 1990s.Many of those tech funds imploded following the 2000 bubble. The Wall Street Journal wrote a catch-up piece about Van Wagoner and other late 1990s tech gurus in 2010 with the headline \"From Fame, Fortune to Flamed-Out Stars. Post-Bust Fates of Tech-Fund Mavens.\"Is Wood destined for similar ignominy?Rivals take issue with Wood making such big bets on only a handful of stocks. The Ark Innovation ETF, for example, has nearly half its assets concentrated in its top 10 holdings. Beyond Tesla, that fund also owns sizable stakes in Roku (ROKU), Coinbase, Zoom (ZM) and Square (SQ). Roku is another example of a high-risk/high-reward stock that Wood loves.\"Our investment approach is similar to Ark in that we are focusing on tech. But we're different in that we avoid concentration,\"Jeremie Capron, head of research at ROBO Global, told CNN Business in March. The top 10 holdings in the\u00a0ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index (ROBO) ETF\u00a0account for less than 20% of the fund's total assets, and the fund owns about 80 stocks. Ark funds typically own shares in only about 30 to 50 companies.For the time being, Wood is having the last laugh. Yes, her fund's returns may be volatile year-to-year \u2014 the Ark Innovation ETF fell nearly 25% in 2018 before rebounding 30% in 2019 \u2014 but it has tended to smooth out. The five-year average annualized return for the Ark Innovation ETF through mid-2021 was 48.6%, compared to 17.7% for the S&P 500. As long as that long-term trend continues, Ark acolytes may forgive a down year every now and then as Wood continues to swing for the fences.",

He should have been concentrating on the student he was tutoring in physics \u2014 a job he did during his free time while enrolled in a post-baccalaureate pre-med program \u2014 but Omar's eyes kept darting back to the Robinhood app open on his phone. \u202fOmar had invested $6,000 in Beyond Meat options; in the days before that tutoring session he'd seen the value of that investment rocket up to almost $15,000. What he was witnessing now, though, felt like torture. \u202fDown $2,000. \u202fDown $3,000. Read More\u202fBy lunchtime, the stock options Omar had bought were down around $7,000 from their peak. \u202fOmar knew he should probably sell the options before they became worthless. But he followed the mantra of the place where he'd first learned about options trading, the subreddit r/wallstreetbets, and held on. \"It was diamond hands,\" said Omar, using the site's term for holding an option even after incurring extreme losses or gains. \"It was like, all or nothing.\" \u202fWithin two days Omar had lost not only his gains but his entire initial investment.\u202f \u202fDesperate to earn it back, Omar, 23 years old and the child of working-class immigrant parents, took the rest of the money he could scrounge up \u2014 cash from his tutoring gig, his stimulus check, a chunk of his freshly-deposited student loans that was supposed to pay for his living expenses (which were basically non-existent after he had moved home during the Covid-19 outbreak) \u2014 and poured all of it, $22,000, into his Robinhood account. Then he opened up WallStreetBets. \u202fI would not have traded options if I had not found WallStreetBets.\"\"Omar,\" WallStreetBets user\u202f\"I was really scared,\" Omar told CNN Business in an interview in August. \"All I wanted to do was just make my initial money back and pay it off.\" \u202fBy the end of the week, he had lost it all again. \u202fOmar, who spoke on the condition that he be referred to using a pseudonym out of concern over the legality of trading with money from his student loans, said that he blames himself for his losses but regrets ever stumbling upon one of Reddit's most active communities. \u202f\"I would not have traded options,\" Omar admitted, \"if I had not found WallStreetBets.\" This January, with WallStreetBets now an inescapable presence, Omar was back on the board. Back to trading.Stock market meets internet fringe culture  This past week has been a banner one for Reddit's island of misfit investors.  WallStreetBets exploded into the mainstream, moving from the front page of Reddit to the front page of the New York Times and nearly every other major news site. The subreddit's short-squeeze of GameStop helped shoot up the price of the video game retailer's stock a mind-boggling 1,700% from the beginning of January to Wednesday (before it fell again Thursday), captivating the minds and wallets of investors \u2014 both casual and institutional \u2014 and financial regulators.  But while millions are now discovering WallStreetBets for the first time, it has been building momentum throughout the pandemic. One can trace its epic rise to a perfect storm of favorable conditions: the exponential growth of the app Robinhood and its no-fee options trading, the extreme volatility Covid-19 brought to the markets, the stimulus checks mailed to millions of Americans, the lack of televised sports for much of the year, and the unwanted free time stuck at home the pandemic has forced on many people.Describing itself as if \"4chan found a Bloomberg terminal,\" the forum's giddy nihilism, inscrutable language and memes fueled a war on a perceived corrupted mainstream.And it's led WallStreetBets' evolution into an unprecedented force of retail-investing financial radicalism, offering the allure of get-rich-quick gains to a rapidly expanding audience of millions. (5, at last count).\n\nMany celebrated WallStreetBets' war on GameStop short-sellers as a populist campaign against hedge-fund raiders looking to profit off the destruction of a well-known retail brand like GameStop. But unlike many other similar online communities, there is also a clear financial goal for the people in it.  \"It's a means to an end,\" explained one of them, AJ Vanover.  At his retail job in a battery store in Missouri, Vanover makes around $35,000 a year. But on Wednesday, he found himself a paper millionaire. (His Robinhood account exceeded $1 million, according to screenshots he provided, but he hadn't cashed out yet). For months, Vanover had been following GameStop as a \"value play,\" posting his thoughts on WallStreetBets along the way. JUST WATCHEDThis Missouri dad makes $35k.

Vanover said he plans help his parents with their mortgage, and he intends to keep investing in options. \u202f'These guys can move markets' Enter WallStreetBets for the first time and you'll almost certainly be a bit lost. The forum's language can be difficult to understand, even for someone who knows typical Wall Street jargon. The vocabulary specific to the subreddit is extensive, and it will almost never be explained to a newbie earnestly asking for a term's definition. Posters revel in their crudeness; homophobic epithets are tossed around as terms of affection.The site is a chaotic mix of memes, screengrabs of wild losses and gains, the occasional \"deep dive\" into a stock, all unified under the guiding principle of betting as much money as you possibly can on the highest possible risks, generally short-term options trading. Trading individual stocks, as opposed to options, is generally taboo. There's r/investing for you right down the corner, thank you very much. But fringe online movements have shown that internet culture can lead to extreme behaviors, making radical ideas palatable for people raised on memes and 4chan in a way that they likely wouldn't be, at least at first, if presented in a straightforward manner. In the case of WallStreetBets that extremism has a real financial impact.\"These guys can move markets,\" said Jeremy Blackburn, an assistant professor of computer science at Binghamton University who studies extremist communities on the web.  \"That's a huge deal.\" Lana Swartz, assistant professor of media studies at the University of Virginia, describes the subreddit's financial spin on the kind of nihilism seen on 4chan as the idea that its users should have a \"relaxed\" relationship with their money. She characterized the spirit this way: \"Let it come. Let it go. Because the kind of secret that the elites know is that money is. B.S., and only by knowing that money is B.S. can you accumulate a lot of it, which should be your goal.\" It's not even the ends that matter. It's the means. It's the fact that you're placing this bet, that's where the value in all this is. Sure, you may get money, or you may end up broke, but you played the game, and you did it in some crazy way.\"Jeremy Blackburn, assistant professor of computer science, Binghamton UniversityThat ethos on WallStreetBets not only encourages risky trades, but also trading the entirety of your net worth or portfolio in a single risky trade \u2014 a financial move that would be sure to make any certified financial advisor bleed from their ears.\u202f\u202f \"It's not even the ends that matter. It's the means. It's the fact that you're placing this bet, that's where the value in all this is. Sure, you may get money, or you may end up broke, but you played the game, and you did it in some crazy way,\" Blackburn said. \"It is a little bit scary, though, right? Because this is real money. And any time you are more interested in the game than the outcome, that can be incredibly dangerous.\" 4Chan meets a Bloomberg terminal WallStreetBets has long described itself as \"4chan with a Bloomberg terminal.\"  Look closer at communities like 4chan or 8kun, and WallStreetBets, and it's not just a shared use of memes that link them. One key element to 4chan is its opposition to mainstream \"normie\" culture, an idea that has broad applicability. For many on 4chan, normie culture is the popular kids in your high school. For WallStreetBets, the normie culture it stands in opposition to is one of \"safe\" mainstream investing: focusing on long-term gains, maxing out your 401(k)s, buying index funds; Suze Orman 101. \"Boomer\" advice, as users say.  On WallStreetBets, that's all depicted as a sucker's game. \"They don't want to wait 20 years for their bets to pay off,\" Blackburn said. \n\n\n\n\n\nSwartz sees the cynicism surrounding long-term investment advice on WallStreetBets as an understandable reaction for a young generation that has witnessed two economic crises, the chaos of the Trump years, ever-growing inequality and the looming threat of catastrophic climate change. \"We're living in a time of absolutely unprecedented uncertainty,\" she said. \"There really is no reason for anyone in their twenties to imagine that their 401(k) is going to pay off in 50, 60 years the way it did for their parents. And I'm not saying they shouldn't believe it. I'm just saying they have good reason not to.\" The specter of the 2008 financial crisis, in particular, looms large over the community.  \"I was in my early teens during the '08 crisis,\" wrote one user going by the handle ssauronn in a recent post celebrating the site's apparent (albeit potentially fleeting) victory over hedge fund Melvin Capital, which, according to CNBC, closed out its position in GameStop this week after taking a huge loss. \"When that crisis hit our family, we were able to keep our little house, but we lived off of pancake mix, and powdered milk, and beans and rice for a year.\" \"Stop listening to the media that's making us out to be market destroyers, and start rooting for us, because we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to punish the sort of people who caused so much pain and stress a decade ago, and we're taking that opportunity.\" You can also spot a shared nihilism between 4chan and WallStreetBets in their casual and ironic references to suicide. On WallStreetBets, longing \"$ROPE\" is an inside joke for suicide, one that is almost always posted under a disastrous loss. 4chan, 8kun and WallStreetBets exalt a cartoonish version of autism both ironically and sincerely \u2014 \"autists\" is a term of pride on both sites \u2014 as a superpower of persistence that allows one to fully commit to a worldview leagues apart from the stifling conventional wisdom of the mainstream.Stop listening to the media that's making us out to be market destroyers, and start rooting for us, because we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to punish the sort of people who caused so much pain and stress a decade ago, and we're taking that opportunity.\"WallStreetBets userFor political extremists a so-called \"autist's\" powers can be a weapon to be deployed against enemies in destructive doxxing and harassment campaigns. At WallStreetBets, an \"autist's\" power is displayed by committing to a trade with \"diamond hands,\" holding on and refusing to sell even after incurring extreme losses or gains with the goal of attaining ultimate profit. However, there are key differences between WallStreetBets and sites like 4chan.  Unlike other fringe groups, WallStreetBets generally hasn't doxxed its enemies, or brigaded others (when one subreddit aggressively posts on a rival subreddit), and while it has a long-standing rivalry with the staid r/investing \u2014 a subreddit so committed to its ideals of modesty and risk avoidance that it shuns individual stock picks \u2014 StockJock-e, a moderator for r/investing, politely downplayed the beef, calling it \"facetious and exaggerated\" in a message to CNN Business. To Blackburn, who has focused his studies on toxic internet behaviors (\"aholes are my expertise,\" he said), WallStreetBets is \u2014 by the low standards set by others \u2014 a relatively well-behaved online community. \"It's kind of not a bad behaving sub,\" said Blackburn.\"Minus the fact that people are getting wrecked money-wise.\"\u202f Making the big kill To understand how risky the trading strategies employed on WallStreetBets are, it's key to understand just how options trading works. Instead of buying a stock, an options contract allows an investor to purchase the option of buying 100 shares of a stock at a set price in the future. As the expiration date of the contact draws closer, the valuation of the contract can swing rapidly, as it will become worthless to the buyer if it doesn't hit its target price. While options trading is risky \u2014 if you bet wrong you can be stuck with a literally worthless asset \u2014 it also allows for leveraged bets. The shorter the expiration date of an options contact, the riskier and more volatile it becomes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"The nature of stock options convinces people to take a thousand dollars and turn it into a hundred thousand or in some cases, one million dollars,\" said Jaime Rogozinski, who founded WallStreetBets in 2012 but was removed from the site by Reddit in April 2020. (Reddit says he was removed for profiting off the WallStreetBets brand, a claim he denies.) \"You don't feel bad for the person when they lose the thousand dollars.\"  WallStreetBets rise hasn't happened in a vacuum; it coincides with a broader boom in retail options trading.  \"Retail option volumes are completely off the charts,\" said hedge funder Benn Eifert of QVR Advisors, who described the volume as being \"multiples of any prior record that we've ever seen.\" Aided by Robinhood, which revolutionized the ease and cost of trading options \u2014 and which reportedly profits more from them than regular stock trades \u2014 retail investors only have to answer a few short questions to gain access to a volatile world. (Although Robinhood makes this process easy, it cautions that options trading \"entails significant risk and is not appropriate for all investors.\") But if options trading is risky, and short-term options (\"F.D's,\" short for \"Fts Delight\" in WallStreetBets' casually-flung homophobic lingo) are the single riskiest type of options, putting your entire life savings (\"YOLOing\") into a short-term option is, from any \"rational\" financial perspective, complete madness. It's also so common on WallStreetBets that YOLOing has its own flair or tag, allowing you to search through the many, many people posting their life-savings-and-all trades. \"Generally, this kind of behavior tends to result in a loss of most or all of the money of the people involved,\" said Eifert. But of course, high-risk trades come with the tantalizing possibility of high rewards \u2014 rewards that inevitably find themselves on the front page of WallStreetBets. Minhajul, 22, is a college student and part-time pharmacist, born in Bangladesh and raised in Queens, New York, who decided to put his stimulus check into Robinhood after seeing what he described as \"insane\" and \"crazy\" gains posted on WallStreetBets. Buying weekly options trades and reinvesting the entirety of his gains with each successful trade, Minhajul managed to spin his initial $1,200 investment into $280,000 in a delirious two-week period towards the end of July. \"I'm like, 'Holy sh... I'm rich,'\" Minhajul, who did not want his full name printed, recalled in an interview. On the night of July 30th, Minhajul couldn't sleep \u2014 the possibilities now afforded to him by his newfound riches kept swimming his head: a new car, even a new house. But the next morning Minhajul found himself exhausted and passed out for a mid-morning nap. When he woke up, his portfolio had bled $220,000. By the end of the week, he was down to $8,000. Minhajul said he was unfazed by the loss of his unrealized potential gains \u2014 to him he was playing with house money anyway \u2014 but others aren't so lucky. Loss porn and other rituals Click on WallStreetBets' extensive (and always expanding) \"loss\" section, and you'll witness each of the five stages of grief warped through a funhouse mirror of online ironic detachment. \"Loss porn\" is a staple on the site, one with its own rituals. One is expected to post their losses (or gains) with their positions and then face the peanut gallery.\u202f Rubbing salt in the wounds is common (\"Does your sell button not work?\"), as are crude comments about one's \"wife's boyfriend.\" Less prevalent, but still notable, are the genuine words of encouragement when one's despair appears profound enough.\u202f \"Lot of people asking if I'm okay. Honestly, not really. It's going to take a long time to recover financially, and maybe even longer emotionally, knowing how much damage I've done to my own life in more ways than just the money,\" said one Reddit user who claimed to have lost $28,000.\u202f \"Your d still works...You'll feel like s*t for a while, rightfully so, but set yourself a small goal and go achieve it,\" counseled another.\u202f Scroll around Wallstreetbets long enough and you'll inevitably find those in the throes of what can only be seen as a possible gambling addiction.\u202f One Reddit user posted a screenshot of a $134,000 loss titled \"YOLO is a hell of a drug! Farewell boys,\" describing themselves as a healthcare worker who had gambled away years of savings on YOLO trades. In the comments on their farewell post, they described the mindset that led them from being a \"rational investor\" to gambling their life savings on options trades.\u202f I went from a rational investor to some sick irrational desperate gambler.\"WallStreetBets user\"I just [wanted to] break even. If I break even I'll stop. And you never do. Overly aggressive, over margined YOLO plays after that. I study and stared at the charts every trading day in day trading grandeur, thinking my probability has increased that much more from my first big win... Desperate option plays at the end.\" \"I went from a rational investor to some sick irrational desperate gambler.\"Weeks after their \"farewell,\" they were back on the site.\u202f \"No emergency fund. No retirement,\" they wrote. \"And lost my last check on a credit spread.\"A massive new audience WallStreetBets' burst into the mainstream has left it in uncharted territory.  There are the legal questions surrounding the site's collective push to boost GameStop's shares, with the SEC announcing in a statement that it is \"aware of and actively monitoring\" the volatility of the markets. \n\n\n\n\nThe White House and newly sworn-in Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen are \"monitoring\" GameStop's stock bonanza and WallStreetBets briefly went private on Wednesday, as the moderators made the site private to \"ensure Reddit's content policy and the WSB rules are enforceable.\" On Thursday, Robinhood, the trading platform of choice on WallStreetBets, made a controversial move to limit trading on GameStop, AMC, Nokia and other stocks promoted on the subreddit. Reddit said in a statement to CNN Business that its \"site-wide policies prohibit posting illegal content or soliciting or facilitating illegal transactions. We will review and cooperate with valid law enforcement investigations or actions as needed.\"\u202f And even if the forum survives scrutiny \u2014 whether regulatory, legal or from Reddit \u2014 it will have another issue to contend with. When part of the draw of a place online is the community, the shared language and jokes and memes, what happens when new people unfamiliar with any of that come suddenly flooding in?\u202f With WallStreetBets' campaign against Melvin Capital now gracing the front pages of newspapers, those who have been burned by WallStreetBets' advice in the past are finding the allure of striking it rich on weekly options trades hasn't fully disappeared. Omar, the pre-med student who lost tens of thousands of dollars on weekly options trades, told CNN Business that he is back on WallStreetBets, trying to recoup what he lost trading money from his student loans last year. He'd bought one GameStop option which shot up to $10,000 from $7,000 amid Wednesday's rally.  \"There is a pandemic. There is nothing to do. I can't party. I can't go outside, and the prospect of making a little money sounds really good,\"Omar reasoned. \"What's not to like?\"",

        "content": "When Costco opened its first store in China in 2019, it wasn't just the hot rotisserie chickens and discounted Birkin bags that lured frenzied crowds. A fiery, throat-tingling liquor called Kweichow Moutai also flew off shelves.  At 1,498 yuan, or $209 for a half-liter bottle, it might not sound like the kind of bargain Costco shoppers usually go for \u2014 but in this case, it absolutely was. That price represented a steep discount over Moutai sold elsewhere \u2014 that is, if you could get your hands on it. The luxury spirit is so beloved in China, it sold out quickly. Even amid a global pandemic, Kweichow Moutai, the company that makes the eponymous liquor, had a banner year: its stock surged around 70% on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2020. The company, which is part state-owned and part publicly-traded, is China's most valuable firm outside of technology \u2014 worth more than the country's four biggest banks. Globally, its market cap has not only surpassed all other alcohol distillers like Diageo and Constellation Brands, but also Coca-Cola, which had long held the crown as the world's largest beverage maker by market cap. Valued at 2.7 trillion yuan, or $421 billion, Kweichow Moutai is worth more than Toyota, Nike and Disney, too.  \"Anytime they have any stock [of the product] available, it's going to be gone almost instantly,\" said Ben Cavender, the Shanghai-based managing director of China Market Research Group. \"You'll see people clamoring [for it].\" Apart from the Chinese diaspora, however, Moutai is still virtually unknown overseas. Almost all \u2014 about 97% \u2014 of its sales come from China alone, according to its financial reports. Read MoreSo how is a company that sells its products primarily in just one country now worth more than some longstanding global behemoths? And can Kweichow Moutai, which is described by some Westerners as \"drinking liquid razor blades,\" succeed in appealing to non-Chinese consumers?An employee displays China's leading liquor maker Kweichow Moutai at a supermarket in Nantong city, in China's Jiangsu province in 2018.From historic icon to status symbol Moutai has one unmistakable advantage: the drink is China's national spirit.  Moutai baijiu \u2014 the type of liquor the company makes \u2014 is a clear, potent spirit that's been dubbed \"firewater,\" thanks to the fact that it's 53% alcohol. The red-and-white bottles of its flagship product, \"Feitian,\" or \"Flying Fairy,\" are a staple at Chinese state banquets and business events.I think if we drink enough Moutai, we can solve anything.\"Henry Kissinger, US Secretary of State, speaking in 1974 Known as the favorite tipple of Mao Zedong, founder of Communist China, and as the \"drink of diplomacy,\" it was famously used to welcome former US President Richard Nixon on his historic trip to China in 1972, and again in 2013 when Chinese President Xi Jinping met with his US counterpart, Barack Obama, in California.Once, at a state dinner in 1974, US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger told Deng Xiaoping, the future Chinese leader: \"I think if we drink enough Moutai, we can solve anything.\" \"Then, when I go back to China, we must take steps to increase our production of it,\" Deng responded, according to an archived US government transcript.President Richard Nixon toasting Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai at banquet in China in 1972.Being part of so many major public events in China \"really set the brand in the national consciousness,\" said Cavender, who likened it to another giant beverage maker, Coca-Cola, in that regard. \"That's the same reason why Coke has actually done so well from a marketing perspective. If you look at the way they've done their advertising over the past 50 years, they're at pretty much every big event. You see Coke at when the Berlin Wall comes down. You see Coke commercials at Christmas. I think Moutai is that brand for China, and so I think that part explains why it's so popular.\" A Moutai representative declined requests to be interviewed for this story.Some say the story goes back even further in Communist Party lore. During the Red Army's \"Long March\" in China in the 1930s, soldiers used to pour Moutai on their feet to help disinfect wounds, Chinese state media has reported, citing a former army lieutenant general. Legend has it that members of the Red Army even used to turn to the drink to knock themselves out before surgery, said Hao Hong, head of research at BOCOM International, the securities arm of China's Bank of Communications. \"It's a story [that goes around],\" he said. \"They didn't have anesthesia. So they had to use Moutai as a drug to numb [people] from surgery.\" Today, the brand is seen more as a luxury status symbol than for its \"Red\" roots. Some customers buy it not to drink, but to keep as investments. Limited-edition cases are collected and showcased by international auction houses, like Christie's, which says that some bottles can fetch more than $40,000 each. Moutai products being placed in a liquor store in the town of Maotai in Guizhou province, China, last June.Moutai has found a way to be \"approachable for a lot of regular consumers, at least for special occasions,\" while at the same time also offering collectors' items that reach the ultra-rich, said Cavender. \"That's something that makes Moutai, I think, different, from a lot of the international beverage brands,\" he said.  It's also been a tremendous advantage during an economically tough year: wealthy consumers who are spending less on travel may splurge more on liquor, Cavender added.A meteoric rise Moutai has long been seen as one of China's blue-chip stocks. In 2017, it became the world's biggest liquor maker by market value, surpassing Diageo (DEO), the British owner of Johnnie Walker, Guinness and Tanqueray.  In 2019, Moutai also became the first Chinese company since 2005 to see its share price hit 1,000 yuan (about $145), notching another market record. And last year, it became the most valuable non-tech company in China. (Alibaba and Tencent, the country's top two tech giants, are valued higher, with their shares listed in New York and Hong Kong respectively.)In 2020, Moutai's shares soared 69% to record highs.  \n\nHong said that he believed there was no major impetus for the rally last year; just that \"most people are gradually realizing the ability of this company to be able to generate strong cash flow and no debt.\" \"It's like a badge of honor for value investing,\" he added. \"People love the stock \u2014 because year after year, it just continues to deliver.\"Xian Li, a 66-year-old retiree in Shanghai, is one of those people. He's invested in Moutai since 2004, just three years after it went public.

Since then, he's invested more than 136,000 yuan (about $21,000) into the stock. The payoff has been huge: a few years ago, he made enough to put his son through university. \"The dividend [alone] each year could cover my daily expenses,\" said Li, who plans to hold onto the stock indefinitely. \"It's also going to help me to afford medical bills and nursing home expenses.\" Not everyone is so bullish. Allen Cheng, an equity analyst at Morningstar, made headlines in 2019 when he downgraded his rating on Moutai's stock to sell. Cheng, who has since maintained that position, argues that the company's prospects are overblown, and that \"the market has already reflected all the positives of the past 10 years.\" \"Being the only hater is really difficult for me,\" he said with a laugh. \"I think it's a bubble here.\"It's like a badge of honor for value investing. People love the stock \u2014 because year after year, it just continues to deliver.\"Hao Hong, head of research at BOCOM International, the securities arm of China's Bank of Communications Authorities, too, have warned investors of a potential stock bubble. In 2017, Moutai suffered a huge selloff \u2014 wiping $7.8 billion off its market cap in one day \u2014 after state-run news agency Xinhua, which often conveys the Communist leadership's sentiment, urged investors to take a more \"rational view\" of the company.\"It's important for Kweichow Moutai ... to stick to its slow pace,\" Xinhua said in an editorial. \"Pulling up a plant to make it grow inevitably leads to unbearable pain. Short-sighted speculation will cause tremendous damage to the value of investment.\" The move was not uncommon. Beijing frequently tries to sway investors through state media, such as last summer, when a government-run publication encouraged people to buy into stocks. That could have a domino effect, particularly because mainland Chinese stock markets are dominated by retail investors. According to a 2020 survey by the China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation, almost all investors there \u2014 99% \u2014 were individuals.The making of Moutai One of Moutai's biggest advantages is its ability to keep the price of its product high. It claims to have limited capacity since it can only produce its drinks in one place. Similar to champagne \u2014 which comes from the eponymous region in France \u2014 Kweichow Moutai is named after Maotai, a picturesque small town in the southwestern Chinese province of Guizhou. (The company's name is based on an old romanization of the town's Chinese name.) Like champagne, the drink can only be called Moutai if it's produced in that specific location.This is where the company says its baijiu \u2014 distilled from fermented sorghum and rice \u2014 gets the magic touch. A worker at a Moutai distillery in November 2020. Environmental factors, such as the town's climate and seasonal changes in the water of the local river, help give the liquor its unique taste and is \"beneficial to the production process,\" according to the Moutai Museum.Inside the town, Moutai's impact on the economy is deeply felt. As of 2019, Maotai was the richest town in western China, according to disposable income statistics from the municipal government of Renhuai, in Guizhou province. (Guizhou is among the country's poorest regions.) That would never have happened if it weren't for the beverage giant, said Qi Wang, a local resident. \"Kweichow Moutai is the leader of Maotai,\" he said, adding that the company's boom helped encourage him to open his own liquor factory. \"It influences all aspects of the town's development.\"  \n\n\n\n\nIts close ties with the government don't always guarantee protection, though. In 2013, sales slumped when President Xi embarked on an anti-corruption drive, leading the government to stamp out any sign of \"extravagance\" among officials, including of expensive liquor. The campaign led to \"unprecedented pressure\" on the alcohol industry, Moutai noted in an earnings report. Sales still grew that year, but only around 17%, compared to 44% the previous year. In 2014, that number plunged to about 2%.  The firm has since bounced back \u2014 though it now faces other problems. In recent years, it's been dogged by numerous corruption scandals, which has led to the ouster of several top executives, according to state media. Other major firms have faced similar pressure. China regularly investigates powerful executives for corruption \u2014 while using the findings to send a warning to others. This month, a Chinese court sentenced Lai Xiaomin, the former chief of a top, state-owned financial firm, to death for bribery. Is China enough? Moutai has an outsize reliance on the Chinese market. To be sure, the company has tried to push overseas, notably by starting a \"fan club\" in the United States, traveling to Africa to woo new business partners and teaming up with foreign players, such as Italy's Inter Milan soccer club. But for the most part, it's had little to show for it. In 2019, almost 97% of sales still came from China. Last March, the company launched a social media campaign called \"stay at home with Moutai,\" which encouraged users around the world to try new recipes during lockdown. One Instagram and Twitter post, for instance, suggested mixing the drink into a \"sunset cocktail,\" while another offered instructions for a noodle dish that could pair with the liquor. The campaign demonstrated an effort to stay connected with international consumers, even during the pandemic. But analysts have pointed to other challenges ahead.Moutai needs to do more to diversify, according to Spiros Malandrakis, industry manager of alcoholic drinks at Euromonitor International. \"It needs to have started yesterday,\" he said. \"International spirits always start local, like baijiu, but they become international. That's the key. That's how you take over the world. That's how you become sustainably big.\" A customer shops for Kweichow Moutai at a supermarket in Nantong city, east China's Jiangsu province in December 2018.Malandrakis pointed to Mexican tequila, Russian vodka and American bourbon as examples. None of those \"would have survived\" if they didn't go global, he added. The process, of course, doesn't happen overnight. William Dong, managing director of Evershine Australia, which distributes Moutai in Australia, New Zealand and Italy, said that many people still need to be educated about what baijiu even is. \"We have distributed the product into basically everywhere that we could,\" he said in an interview from Sydney.   At the end of the day, most customers are still Chinese, he added. \"I would say probably 80%.\" It doesn't help that the drink is an acquired taste. Some people eschew Moutai's strong kick, while others label it \"firewater.\" \"[Some] Westerners find it, and I quote, 'kind of like drinking liquid razor blades,'\" said Malandrakis. An even bigger threat, however, may be generational and gender gaps within China. Currently, the core demographic for baijiu is 40 to 60-year-old men, according to Malandrakis.  800 drones perform in teams in the night sky to form a \"Moutai wine bottle\" pattern in Renhuai, Guizhou, China in June 2020.\"The next generation of drinkers does not particularly want to do exactly what their father's generation did,\" he explained. \"It's not great for the future, if you don't start having new people coming in.\" Malandrakis compared it to sherry, which was loved for centuries but later fell out of popularity as it \"became synonymous with consumption of older populations.\" The next generation of drinkers does not particularly want to do exactly what their father's generation did. It's not great for the future, if you don't start having new people coming in.\"SPIROS MALANDRAKIS, INDUSTRY MANAGER OF ALCOHOLIC DRINKS AT EUROMONITOR INTERNATIONALNot everyone is so worried. Even with its weak international position, Moutai's baijiu was the world's best-selling liquor in 2019, according to Euromonitor. \"The Chinese market is so big, and it's continuing to become more wealthy,\" said Cavender. He also noted a recent swell in local pride, which could draw more domestic consumers in. For all its challenges, even critics admit the company's dominance is nowhere near diminishing. \"The brand \u2014 and the heritage that the brand has \u2014 it's really impossible to replicate that,\" Cavender said. \"Somebody can't set up a new venture tomorrow and do what they can do. It's not sort of possible to go back in time and get Mao Zedong to be interested in your drink. It's not possible to sort of be located in the town where they make their products. So I think they have a strong built-in story that allows them to flourish.\" CNN's Beijing bureau and Serenitie Wang contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Two years ago, Shani Dowell gave up a stable career and much of her bank account to take a chance on a business idea.\u202fAs a mother and a former math teacher, she knew not all parents felt comfortable raising important feedback to teachers and school administrators. Instead, she found, they'd often chat amongst themselves about issues that came up at school.There had to be a better way, she thought, so she founded Possip.\u202fShort for \"positive gossip,\" the startup, which schools subscribe to annually, uses text messages to get quick surveys and reactions from parents ranging from praise for teachers to feedback on bullying and school culture.\u202fDespite early success getting parents and administrators interested, however, initially attracting investors to scale up the small company was an uphill battle.  Shani Dowell is the founder of Possip, a platform connecting schools with real-time feedback from parents. Read More\"When I originally would go out and pitch Possip to people, especially to typically wealthier men, they sometimes didn't understand the problem, and part of why they potentially didn't see the problem is because they may not have ever had the experience of not feeling entitled and empowered to share their voice or share their opinions,\" Dowell said. \"Some investors in the education technology space had a jarring disconnect from what was happening at schools and what parents might actually need,\" she said.  Luckily, after running the company for almost three years, Dowell had insights from roughly 100 schools to back her up, and finally, she found an institutional investor, too: LaunchTN, a public-private partnership led by a female CEO and funded in part by the State of Tennessee.Today, Possip has a presence in 700 schools across 24 states. And Dowell is one of the few Black women in the US who have raised $1 million or more in funding for their businesses.\u202f Although Black women are the fastest-growing group of female entrepreneurs in the United States, they've long been slighted by startup investors and significantly under-funded. But in spite of the  obstacles they face, these founders are forging ahead and continuing to thrive in their businesses. In fact, the number of Black women who have raised over $1 million in funding has more than doubled since 2018, according to ProjectDiane, a biennial report released Wednesday. The report, which tracks publicly-announced funding of Black and Latinx women-founded businesses, is compiled by digitalundivided, a nonprofit focused on supporting entrepreneurial women of color. It uses data from Crunchbase and Pitchbook to track crowdfunding, angel, seed and venture round investments. It's possible the data doesn't include some founders who are not listed in those databases or didn't disclose funding publicly. According to ProjectDiane, at the start of 2018, just 34 Black women had raised $1 million or more in outside investments for their businesses. But now, in data tracked through August 2020, more than 90 Black women have hit or exceeded that level. The numbers of Latinx women who've reached that milestone also grew quickly, although they remain incredibly underrepresented in VC circles, too. Still, it's an impressive upswing that could signal a shift in a startup landscape largely dominated by White men. \n\n\n\nThis milestone comes amid a backdrop of protests against systemic racism and an unprecedented push to support and buy from Black-owned businesses. Founders and advocates are hoping to build upon that momentum, but also wonder if the support being shown to Black-owned businesses, let alone those founded by Black women, is here to stay.\u202f \"Businesses founded by women of color are in focus now, and specifically those founded by Black women because of the racial reckoning,\" said Lauren Maillian, CEO of digitalundivided. \"But we want and we need to make sure that they continue to gain great investment moving forward.\"  Bridging the funding gap is long overdue\u202f The number of businesses owned by Black women grew 50% from 2014 to 2019, the fastest growth among all female entrepreneurs, according to American Express projections based on Census data. Black women make up nearly 14% of the female population in the US, but 42% of all new women-owned businesses during that time.  Many of these companies are small, local businesses and not necessarily seeking outside investors. That said, for those founders who are focused on scaling up quickly, there's a huge gap between their entrepreneurial ambitions and the funding they're able to secure: Black women have received less than 1% of venture capital funding, analyzed by ProjectDiane since it started tracking the data. Perhaps not coincidentally, few Black women are in a position to make decisions on how capital is invested in startups. Only 4% of the VC workforce is Black, and only 3% of the people actually leading investments are Black, according to data from the National Venture Capital Association.  \"You have this huge deficit within the ecosystem for Black women,\" said Dell Gines, senior community development advisor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City who conducted a year-long study on startups owned by Black women released in 2018.  Venture capitalists still aren't investing in women or minorities, and they're leaving trillions on the table \"Venture capital is by and large a network-based industry, where you have a series of gatekeepers and other hurdles to get in front of because there's greater demand for capital than there's usually supply. You also have these filtering mechanisms that traditionally don't include people of color and women, because that's how the networks originated.\"  There's been improvement in the last couple years, but not enough to close the gaps. Collectively, Black women founders raised $700 million in 2018 and 2019, up from $289 million raised in 2009 to 2017, according to ProjectDiane. Despite the major increase, however, Black women founders accounted for just 0.27% of the $276.7 billion in startup funding raised by all companies in those years, as tracked by Pitchbook.The dearth in numbers stems back to a number of well-documented reasons including unconscious bias, systemic barriers and gender and racial stereotyping. The missed opportunity and economic cost of not investing in Black women is huge, Gines said.  If you improve the rate of Black women entrepreneurship \u2014 their ability to grow and scale \u2014 then you improve the entire community,\" Dell Gines, senior community development advisor, Kansas City Fed\"If you improve the rate of Black women entrepreneurship \u2014 their ability to grow and scale \u2014 then you improve the entire community,\" he said, pointing to research that connects entrepreneurship growth rates with economic growth.   Black women aren't newcomers to entrepreneurship. Even before women could vote, they owned businesses.\u202f  \"We've been entrepreneurs. As soon as we could actually control our own destinies, create our own and monetize our own ideas we've been doing it,\" said Kathryn Finney, founder of digitalundivided and The Doonie Fund, which makes microinvestments in Black-women-owned businesses. \"It's just been times throughout our history where that desire, that force has been artificially depressed by outside forces.\"\u202f Raising funds is not a one-size-fits-all Black women may now be starting businesses at a record pace, but they're still having to overcome massive obstacles in doing so.  Among Black women business owners, 66% describe access to credit and funds for expansion as one of their greatest financial challenges. Only 39% of their nonminority peers say the same, according to the Federal Reserve System's 2016 Small Business Credit Survey, which is based on a convenience sample of businesses. Black women also reported being less likely to receive some or all of the financing they requested and are significantly more likely to not apply for financing because they felt discouraged by a lack of credit opportunities.  \u202f  \u202f \n\nRather than turn to debt or equity financing to fund their businesses, many rely on financial reserves like their savings as the main source of startup capital.\u202f According to the Fed survey, 31% of Black women business owners rely on personal funds to finance their businesses, whereas only 16% of nonminority women business owners say the same. Much of those reserves, Finney says, come from \"our own personal funds, maybe refinancing our mortgages, or taking loans from our 401(k), all things that impact our long-term wealth.\"  \u202fThat was the case for Denise Woodard, a former Coca-Cola executive. She was spurred to create Partake Foods, an allergy-friendly snack company, nearly four years ago in response to her daughter's food allergies.  Woodard started off with a Kickstarter campaign before raising capital from family and friends. In spite of the growing traction her products were getting and local placement in Whole Foods and Wegmans, Woodard was forced to empty her 401(k) and sell her engagement ring to keep the company going.   \"It was definitely difficult,\" she said. \"It was coming in dribs and drabs of like $5,000 and $10,000 checks and not fast enough.\"  But a breakthrough finally did come.  After being turned down by nearly 100 investors, Woodard received the 'yes' she needed from Jay-Z's Marcy Venture Partners, which led a seed round of $1 million for the company last summer that also included her former Coca-Cola boss, Chuck Muth, now chief growth officer of Beyond Meat and The Factory.Denise Woodard founded Partake after her daughter's struggle with food allergies and the lack of allergen-free food options on grocery aisles. She's since raised new investment from Grammy award-winning singer H.E.R. along with additional funding from Marcy Venture Partners. And the company's footprint has expanded to nearly 3,000 stores including retailers such as Target, Whole Foods, Sprouts and Wegmans.  Woodard is also trying to boost Black and brown representation in the food and beverage industry, with the launch of a fellowship program for students at historically Black colleges and universities to explore career pathways at consumer-packaged goods companies. She hopes the program can make the journey smoother and more seamless for others. \"As I've grown the company, I'm realizing that Partake has the opportunity to stand for something much larger than people with food allergies being able to partake, and just this bigger feeling of inclusivity and everyone having a seat at the table, regardless of their gender, race, socioeconomic class or food restrictions, this idea that everyone is welcome,\" Woodard said. \"I started Partake with a tiny picture, and it's really broadened a lot since we've been in business.\"  Changing the ecosystem  The country's racial reckoning may have sparked some new efforts to rectify years of gross underfunding of Black women founders, but there were a number of positive forces that emerged even prior to 2020.  New funds, online communities, programs and alternative sources of funding are focusing on diversifying who receives startup capital.  One significant example, the New Voices Fund was launched in 2017 when Unilever acquired Sundial Brands, the maker of SheaMoisture and other skin care and hair care lines. Richelieu Dennis, Sundial's founder and then-CEO, created the New Voices Fund to invest in companies run by women of color, and Unilever became an anchor investor as part of the partnership. To date, the fund has invested more than $60 million. Companies like The Honey Pot, The Lip Bar and Mielle Organics, all of which are now available in Target stores, were able to expand in part due to those investments.JUST WATCHEDThe Honey Pot Company is changing the feminine hygiene aisleReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe Honey Pot Company is changing the feminine hygiene aisle 02:46Another effort, Founder Gym, founded by Mandela SH Dixon, is an online training program for underrepresented founders including Black women, which teaches them how to raise money to scale their startups. Several of the more than 90 Black women who have raised millions for their startups have been a part of the program, including Shani Dowell of Possip, as well as Olamide Olowe, who founded Topicals, a skincare brand for people with chronic skin conditions and Jasmine Shells, who cofounded Five To Nine, an event management platform.  Another such example, Black Girl Ventures, a nonprofit organization launched by Shelly Bell in 2016, has helped to scale more than 100 Black and brown women-owned businesses across 12 cities through its pitch competitions. Many Black women founders have also found success by tapping into alternative sources of capital such as crowdfunding.  Dawn Dickson-Akpoghene raised over $1 million in an equity crowdfunding campaign in 2019 for her company PopCom, which makes touchless vending machines for regulated products like alcohol, tobacco and cannabis. The founder of Ethel's Club, Naj Austin, raised $25,000 by using crowdfunding to establish her company, a social and wellness club for people of color. She went on to raise more than $1 million from institutional and angel investors.We have a culture of embracing entrepreneurship as Black women and seeing other Black women continue to do it is what really makes the difference,\" Lauren Maillian, CEO of digitalundividedThese efforts haven't come just on the founder side. There have also been a number of initiatives pushing for more diversity among the investors who make decisions on who gets funded and why in the startup landscape. Organizations such as All Raise, BLK VC and HBCUvc have focused on accelerating representation of Black and women investors to build a more equitable ecosystem in venture capital.  With these efforts combined, advocates like Maillian from digitalundivided hold hope that even beyond the moment of racial reckoning in 2020, Black women founders will still continue to thrive. \"We have a culture of embracing entrepreneurship as Black women and seeing other Black women continue to do it is what really makes the difference,\" she said. \"And signals to our peers and to future generations, what is truly possible.\"\u2014 An earlier version of this story included the wrong title for Queen Chinyere Quinn in a photo caption.

        "content": "One day in June 2019, Jitarth Jadeja went outside to smoke a cigarette. For two years he'd been in the virtual cult of QAnon. But now he'd watched a YouTube video that picked apart the last element of the theory he believed in. Standing there smoking, he would say later, he felt \"shattered.\" He had gone down the QAnon rabbit hole; now, having emerged from it, he had no idea what to do next. 'QAnon only hurts people. It has helped nobody.'QAnon is a virtual cult that began in late 2017.The most basic QAnon belief casts President Trump as the hero in a fight against the \"deep state\" and a sinister cabal of Democratic politicians and celebrities who abuse children. And it features an anonymous government insider called \"Q\" who purportedly shares secret information about that fight via cryptic online posts. Travis View is a conspiracy theory researcher who co-hosts the podcast \"QAnon Anonymous.\"Read MoreThe theory's believers \"always fantasize that they are saving children and they're bringing criminals to justice,\" View says. \"But QAnon only hurts people. It has helped nobody.\"There aren't solid estimates for the number of QAnon followers worldwide, but it's clear their ranks are growing. A CNN investigation reviewed QAnon-related Facebook pages and groups based only outside the US and found a total of at least 12.8 million interactions between the beginning of the year and the last week of September.An attendee at a Trump rally holds up a QAnon sign on August 4, 2018. (Bloomberg via Getty Images)Lisa Kaplan and Cindy Otis lead Alethea Group, a company that tracks disinformation to protect its clients' brands. They followed false claims that Wayfair was complicit in a child exploitation plot as they spread from havens for QAnon to the mainstream in the summer of 2020.\"There's not sort of, one sort of set doctrine or belief system,\" Otis said. \"But a lot of it goes down to what goes viral and what doesn't.\" 'It's like a parasite.\" How a dangerous virtual cult is going globalLike many previous conspiracy theory groups, QAnon has become as much about community as its actual theory. The result is a convoluted and ever-changing web of beliefs which branch off from the central worldview. In this case, that includes things like members of the supposed cabal also worshipping Satan, and JFK Jr. having faked his 1999 death in a plane crash to escape the deep state plotters. QAnon has also started assimilating unrelated conspiracy theories, including false ideas about the supposedly dangerous nature of 5G infrastructure and the false, dangerous notion that the Covid-19 pandemic is a ploy to monitor private citizens.Since there's no leadership or structure to QAnon, its supporters incorporate existing conspiracy theories and develop new ones. QAnon \"really does take on a life of its own, which can, in fact make it a more significant threat,\" Kaplan said. 'A car crash you can't look away from'Jadeja, the former QAnon believer, is Australian. But he said he's always been interested in American politics. He spent time studying in the US, living in Queens, New York. His nationality is a testament to the fact that QAnon has spread well beyond the United States. \"If you'd look in Australian politics, it's boring by comparison,\" Jadeja said. \"American politics, it's like, it's like a car crash you can't look away from.\"During the 2016 US presidential election, Jadeja said, he was drawn to then-candidate Bernie Sanders. He liked what Sanders had to say about inequality and his \"anti-establishment sentiment.\" But then Trump won. \"That kind of really kicked it all off for me,\" Jadeja said. Jitarth Jadeja, 32, found QAnon in 2017. He spent two years entrenched in the virtual cult. His biggest regret? Sharing the conspiracy theory with his father. (Bill Code for CNN Business)It felt to him like the world was shocked by Trump's win. How had seemingly no one seen it coming? And most importantly, who had? \"I kind of switched off from all mainstream media,\" Jadeja said.  That's when he began listening to conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and reading Infowars, which exposed him to QAnon theories for the first time. By December 2017, he identified as a Q follower. Around this period, Jadeja said he was in the midst of a 15 year struggle to finish his degree. He'd pulled away from friends and become socially isolated. \"I just felt completely overwhelmed... I was probably in a deep depression I think when I found Q,\" he says. Once Jadeja found QAnon he was quickly sucked in. He would spend time on websites that aggregated posts supposedly from Q, which often first appear on darker corners of the internet like 8kun. Then he'd move on to read the interpretations of those posts from other believers. These interpretations are popular among the QAnon community because posts from \"Q\" are often so vague that they can be read in any number of ways. The tactic tends to lure in supporters the way fraudulent psychics can \u2014 there's little solid information given, so almost anything can be taken as confirmation of a pronouncement by \"Q.\"\"There'd be a lot of Youtube and Reddit mini-celebrities within the community that would be like the anointed decrypter for that point in time,\" Jadeja noted.I was probably in a deep depression I think when I found Q.\" Jitarth Jadeja, former QAnon followerQAnon was all he wanted to talk about. That made life offline increasingly difficult for him, and he pulled away from friends. \"No one believes you. No one wants to talk to you about it. ... You get all angsty and crabby and whatnot. [S]uch shouting, irrational, you sound like the homeless guy on the street yelling about Judgment Day,\" Jadeja said. One of the few people in his regular life with whom he was able to talk with about his newfound interest with was his father. \"We used to talk about it a lot. We used to only talk about it with each other. We show each other things like, did you see that? Did you see that?\" Jadeja said.\"I think superficially it did seem like [QAnon] gave me comfort,\" Jadeja said. \"I didn't realize the nefarious kind of impact it was having on me because it was very insidious how it slowly disconnected me from reality.\"Finding 'answers'Experts say that people often seek out conspiracy theories in times of crisis. \"I think we tend to underestimate the extent to which these sorts of narratives are appealing,\" Alethea Group's Otis said, \"especially when we're in a time of great stress and emotions are high.\"Otis noted that the 2016 US presidential election was one of those times for many people. Now the coronavirus pandemic means uncertainty and anxiety are once again at a high point.\"It's a very compelling narrative to say all of this is orchestrated,\" Otis said. \"There's a cabal coming after you. They're trying to make your life miserable. You want an answer for why bad things are happening? Here they are.\"Protestors hold QAnon-related signs during an anti-lockdown demonstration in Melbourne, Australia on September 5th. Some QAnon followers falsely believe the Covid-19 pandemic is an elaborate hoax. (Darrian Traynor/Getty Images AsiaPac)View, the conspiracy theory researcher, said QAnon preys on vulnerable people who in some cases might be suffering from mental health issues.\"I think it's a mistake to say that QAnon is a conspiracy theory, because this kind of makes it sound like Area 51 or Big Foot,\" he said. \"It's a community of people that radicalizes them into a world view, that just essentially detaches them from reality.\"For Jadeja, the impulses he developed while he believed in QAnon are a source of shame. \"I would have been so happy to see Hillary Clinton dragged in front of a military tribunal, even though she's a civilian,\" he said.\"That still bothers me to this day, how willing and happy and joyfully I would have reacted to something that I would normally want no part in... This is how you get good people to do bad things.\"In a May 2019 bulletin, the FBI warned that conspiracy theories like QAnon could \"very likely\" motivate criminal and sometimes violent activity in the US especially because of the reach and volume of conspiratorial content available online. The platform problemQAnon theories often start out on fringe internet forums like 8kun and 4chan, according to Alethea Group's Kaplan. But once a claim gains popularity there it can quickly catapult onto mainstream social media networks. \"It becomes especially dangerous once these conspiracies go on to platforms like Twitter and Facebook, because it increases the breadth of the reach that these false conspiracies have,\" she said. Reddit banned a popular QAnon subreddit in 2018. In July 2020, Twitter said it had removed more than 7,000 QAnon-associated accounts. Last week, Facebook announced it would ban any pages, groups or Instagram accounts representing QAnon. And on Wednesday, YouTube joined the other platforms, saying it would prohibit conspiracy theory content that threatens or harasses an individual or group. It stopped short of banning QAnon and other dangerous theories completely. But the task of identifying and policing these kinds of accounts is massive. Facebook, for one, has previously made promises to ban certain groups or types of content in the past but enforcement has sometimes been slow or inconsistent.\"This isn't something that there's one solution that will, you know, remove this group from their platform for all eternity,\" Otis said. \"It's going to be an ongoing and dynamic problem.\"View believes these actions may be too late. \"This is a group who are very highly motivated, and they believe that they are fighting essentially an information war.\"Leaving QAfter two years in the world of QAnon, Jadeja said, cracks began to form in his conviction. He believed Wikileaks founder Julian Assange had been instrumental in \"exposing\" Hillary Clinton and had helped win Trump the election. If Trump was trying to bring down the cabal, Jadeja wondered, how could he let Assange face extradition to the US for charges related to publishing secret military and diplomatic documents? On top of that, Jadeja said, he was noticing more logical inconsistencies in QAnon's theories.How QAnon uses religion to lure unsuspecting Christians  But there was one particular piece of \"proof\" he was still holding on to. It went like this: A QAnon follower had supposedly asked Q to tell President Trump to use the phrase \"tip top\" in a speech. Then Trump did. To Jadeja, that had been proof that Q existed and had the ear of the president. But then, as his doubts mounted, he decided to research it further and came across a YouTube video that showed other times Trump had previously said the phrase or something similar. Suddenly \"tip top\" was no longer irrefutable proof, it was probably just coincidence.For others, that might have easily been glossed over, a blip easily dismissed in their belief. But for Jadeja, who was nearing a break with QAnon, it was a turning point.\"It was the worst feeling I had in my life,\" Jadeja said. That's when he went outside for a smoke. 'It starts with empathy and understanding'r/Qult_Headquarters is a forum on Reddit \"dedicated to documenting, critiquing, and debunking the chan poster known as 'Q' and his devotees.\" Its 30,000 members pick apart QAnon theories and point out inconsistencies.It's where Jadeja turned when he stopped believing. He wrote a 659-word post that began with the words \"Q fooled me.\"He thought the group would ridicule him for believing in the conspiracy theory. \"I expected to be torn apart,\" he said.Instead, the opposite happened. According to Jadeja, he got over a hundred responses to his post \u2014 and nearly all of them were supportive. \"These guys put me back together again.\"Three years later, Facebook says it will ban QAnonHe now thinks one of the toughest challenges in trying to deradicalize a QAnon believer is that they view the opposition as \"pure evil.\"\"This is a big problem, not just because people are being taken in and their families are like being ripped apart,\" he said. \"This is an existential battle between good and evil that these people think they're fighting.\" He says he used to think the same thing.This is an existential battle between good and evil that these people think they're fighting.\"Jitarth JadejaAnother Reddit community called QAnonCasualties functions as a support group for friends and family members of QAnon believers. It has more than 28,000 members. There are hundreds of stories of loved ones \"lost\" to QAnon. Friendships ruined. Relationships ended. Families suffering. Looking back, Jadeja said, he doesn't think there is a single relationship in his life that wasn't affected by his time believing in QAnon. \"It's destroyed some of them to this day. It's strained a lot of them to this day.\"But there's one thing in particular that he regrets the most: sharing QAnon with his father. CNN reached out to Jadeja's father multiple times for a comment but he did not respond. Jitarth Jadeja looks at a photo of himself as a child next to his father. (Bill Code for CNN Business)Jadeja thinks it's possible more QAnon believers can follow his path out.\"It has to start with empathy and understanding,\" Jadeja said. That's what the QultHeadquarters community on Reddit gave him.In View's opinion, confronting QAnon believers with facts isn't the best way to deradicalize them. He said the best way to help believers is to remind them of their life before Q. Believers need to be encouraged to ask themselves \"if this new life that they built for themselves is actually productive, if it's actually building towards something good or if it's just a waste of time and it's filling some kind of emotional void.\" Potentially being known as \"the QAnon guy\" among his friends is the last thing Jadeja wants. But he fears the community will continue to grow. That's why, he said, he decided to share his story \u2014 in the hope that other believers might see that there is life after QAnon and reevaluate their choice to support it.Ultimately, he said, he's glad he went down the QAnon rabbit hole. It taught him a lot about hubris, he believes. And, he said, \"It allowed me to really confront, like, the own darkness that's in my own heart.\" \u2014 Additional reporting by Sofia Barrett",

        "content": "Thomas Wall had a problem. It was the summer of 1913 and business was flagging at T. Wall & Sons, his family butcher shop in London.Overheated shoppers just weren't buying the company's specialty sausages. Then, Wall had an epiphany: Selling ice cream could help counteract the seasonal sales slump.The idea was set aside when World War I started a year later. But the arrival of a commercial freezer from the United States in 1922 catalyzed his ambitions. From a factory in west London, Wall's ice cream was soon being hawked to Londoners via horse and cart, and then by salespeople on tricycles. By 1939, there were 8,500 of the company's tricycles on Britain's roads.Wall's ice cream salesmen in Britain in 1922 (left) and 1938 (right).Meanwhile, a consumer goods juggernaut was being created. Wall's was bought by Lever Brothers, then selling Sunlight soap, which merged with Dutch company Margarine Unie in 1930 to create Unilever (UL). The Anglo-Dutch firm has gone on to acquire some two dozen other major ice cream brands, including Klondike and Ben & Jerry's, while pioneering its own Magnum line. It sells ice cream in 63 countries around the world and commands almost a fifth of global ice cream sales, a bigger share than its next four competitors combined, according to market research firm Euromonitor.Read MoreUnilever is now the undisputed king of ice cream. But as the coronavirus pandemic rages on, and lockdowns persist, the company is taking inspiration from the delivery tricycles of its early years to conquer one final frontier: ice cream delivered to your home, on demand.Ice cream around every cornerIt won't have far to travel. Chances are, while reading this article you're no more than a few hundred yards away from a Unilever ice cream.The company owns five of the world's 10 most valuable ice cream brands, including Breyers, Cornetto, Carte d'Or and Ben & Jerry's. But its empire extends far beyond these familiar names. There's Frigo in Spain, Adityaa in India, Holanda in Mexico, Langnese in Germany, Selecta in the Philippines, Ola in South Africa and Ping\u00fcino in Ecuador. In recent years, Unilever has also built out its premium offering to fend off a growing number of innovative rivals, snapping up gelato and sorbet brands such as America's Talenti, Italy's Grom and Australia's Weis.Many of these may be unfamiliar, but you've probably come across the brand that more than any other heralded Unilever's ice cream ambitions: Magnum. The world's best-selling ice cream brand, Magnum's sales to consumers are expected to reach $3.8 billion this year, ahead of sister brand Cornetto ($2.4 billion) and General Mills' (GIS) H\u00e4agen-Dazs ($3.2 billion), said Euromonitor.  Unilever \"got serious\" about ice cream when it launched Magnum in 1989, said Matt Close, the company's executive vice president for global ice cream. Vanilla ice cream bars on sticks, dipped in chocolate that cracks on the first bite and then dissolves in your mouth, were a decadent new taste sensation.\"That really revolutionized the ice cream industry, but also our ice cream business,\" Close told CNN Business. \"Suddenly we moved from being a kind of kids seaside treat to something that people were eating in many more locations.\"The realization that ice cream could be a treat for grownups changed the business. It ushered in a wave of ever more indulgent, upmarket brands, which have in turn given way to healthier, plant-based alternatives as consumer preferences evolve.\n\nUnilever's approach has been to go after the whole market, rather than target any particular segment. Its 35 ice cream brands come at every price point, for all occasions and in just about every size, shape and packaging. There's Breyers Natural Vanilla to eat with apple pie; cheap and cheerful Popsicles on sticks for youngsters; Magnum Bites in small portions to satisfy late-night cravings; and pints of Ben & Jerry's or Talenti for something more extravagant. Sales have soared during the coronavirus pandemic, as families forced to eat at home turn to ice cream to indulge themselves. Sales of Unilever ice cream eaten at home increased by 26% between April and June, and by 16% in the following quarter, compared to the previous year, offsetting a collapse in treats consumed on the go.Lockdowns have also driven millions more people to buy groceries online, ice cream included. That's delivered a shot in the arm to Unilever's e-commerce business and paved the way for its newest market: ice cream on demand.How to make the good stuffMaking ice cream is tricky enough, without adding the logistics of getting it to people whenever they want before it melts.The ice cream business has changed since Wall's started factory production nearly 100 years ago. Now, companies have nearly limitless ways in which to combine milk, cream and sugar with other ingredients to come up with new flavors and formats. Unilever sells 431 different varieties of ice cream just in the United Kingdom and Ireland, while Magnum alone comes in about 35 flavors a year in standard sticks, mini sticks, pints and truffles.Andrew Sztehlo, Unilever's global vice president for ice cream research and development, likens the manufacturing process to a vehicle assembly line. Take the Cornetto, which combines Vanilla ice cream with chocolate coating and hazelnut pieces in a wafer cone.Cornetto ice cream cones in a freezer in Bangkok, Thailand in December 2019.\"Making a Cornetto is the food equivalent of making a motor car,\" he told CNN Business. \"You've got hot things, cold things, things that are at funny angles, things that like water, things that hate water. And they've all got to come together to make this cone. It's very complex and it goes at high speed.\"Even with all this precision and years of experience, technical challenges persist. According to Chris Veitch, a former senior process engineer at Unilever, there are projects every year to try and fix the problem of Cornetto cones occasionally going soggy within their use-by dates.\"Ice cream is an incredibly complex material that's very difficult to model and work with, and there are several highly sensitive processing steps that affect quality,\" Veitch said in a briefing earlier this year hosted by the London-based Institution of Chemical Engineers.That means that whenever Unilever wants to launch a new ice cream or even tweak an existing product by, for example, injecting sauce a little differently, it more often than not has to come up with a new piece of equipment. Hence why there's \"a lot of stainless steel\" and a lot of engineers in Unilever's ice cream factories, according to Sztehlo, who described them as \"Willy Wonka territory.\"\"There's lots of whirling things going up and down, in and out, and so on,\" he added. \"We make billions and billions of ice cream products every year in this way through our factories around the world.\"Twister ice cream lollipops on an assembly line in a Unilever factory in Konya, Turkey.On a missionUnilever executives say they haven't strayed from Wall's strategy of making ice cream as ubiquitous as possible. Beyond getting a Wall's display case into every possible grocery store, that extends to eliminating the need for people to go out and find ice cream in the first place. \"I suppose as an ice cream gang we're a bit messianic,\" said Close. \"We believe that people want it, we've just got to find a way to get it to them.\"Making ice cream available on demand is a key part of Unilever's efforts to reduce its reliance on summer sales, which leaves it vulnerable to changing weather conditions and with a narrow window to earn the bulk of its revenue. \"For Unilever, this has meant repositioning ice cream as an any time snack,\" Euromonitor said in a report earlier this year. A century after Wall's tricycles first hit the roads, the need to make ice cream available at all times means Unilever is once again using workers on wheels to distribute its wares.Ice Cream Now, the company's home delivery business, has boomed during the pandemic. What began as a pilot program in 2016 at Deliveroo's London headquarters with a single freezer and virtual store, is now available in more than 100 cities across 36 markets through partnerships with the likes of Uber Eats, DoorDash, Grubhub (GRUB), Just Eat (JSTTY) and Domino's Pizza (DMPZF).Magnum ice cream boxes in a hypermarket in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in June 2019. Customers can get ice cream delivered within 30 minutes from any number of retail partners, restaurants or cloud kitchens. \"It's about getting ice cream out of [one of those freezers and] into somebody's house,\" Sztehlo said. And it's not stopping at bicycles. The company has teamed up with Terra Drone Europe to explore delivery by air.  It helps that Unilever's ice creams are already in several million freezers around the globe as part of its traditional business. It's grown pickup points for on-demand ice cream to 11,000 globally, an almost four-fold increase since before the pandemic hit. And it's adding more pickup points all the time to get ice cream to people as fast as possible \u2014 crucial for a product that starts to melt at anything above zero degrees Fahrenheit (-18 Celsius).As an ice cream gang, we're a bit messianic. We believe people want it, we've just got to find a way to get it to them.\"Matt Close, UnileverGlobal e-commerce sales of ice cream and frozen desserts were already growing strongly before the coronavirus. But the pandemic is accelerating the shift towards online grocery shopping, benefiting Unilever and rivals with e-commerce businesses, including Halo Top and H\u00e4agen-Dazs.There's room to grow. Euromonitor estimates that online sales of ice cream, including frozen yogurt, will reach around $1.7 billion this year \u2014 a small fraction of the $76.4 billion in overall ice cream sales to consumers.  For Unilever, the growth of ice cream at home, led by brands including Ben & Jerry's and Magnum, is on track to more than offset the collapse in its out of home ice cream revenue this year, which includes sales to restaurants and catering companies.The company has also benefited from some good luck. About two months before much of the world was thrust into coronavirus lockdowns, Ben & Jerry's launched Netflix & Chilll'd, a new peanut butter ice cream flavor with near-perfect messaging for 2020.Ben & Jerry's Netflix & Chilll'd is a peanut butter ice cream with sweet and salty pretzel swirls and fudge brownies.With the path of the pandemic still highly uncertain and some major economies going back into lockdown, Unilever now faces the daunting task of deciding what approach to take next year. Should it make more tubs of Carte d'Or for home consumption or Magnum singles to be eaten on the go? Plans for 2021 are \"a work in progress,\" according to Sztehlo, who joined the ice cream business as an apprentice 35 years ago. He admits that it's been more difficult to come up with the next big idea over video calls, particularly without afternoon office tastings. Those casual gatherings ordinarily take place around a table in New York where 20 kilograms (44 pounds) of different sorts of ice cream are passed around, but they're on hold until further notice. \"We've been missing the social, creativity, interactive moment. That's a bit more sterile,\" he said. The good news, he added, \"is that people want to be happy,\" and they are looking for ways \"to increase their moments of happiness at home.\" Netflix & Chilll'd anyone?",

        "content": "When Costco opened its first store in mainland China last August, absolute chaos ensued. Shoppers lined up for hours and crawled inside before the gates were fully lifted. They wrestled for Birkin bags and rotisserie chickens. Traffic was paralyzed on the surrounding roads, with vehicles clogging up the streets to get into the parking lot. The Shanghai store, unable to handle the rush, closed early and apologized to customers on social media. One year later, the crowds are not quite as frenzied. But Costco (COST) is still flourishing in China \u2014 even during the coronavirus pandemic. The first Costco in China was packed on opening day in Shanghai last year.The company said in March that its Chinese store was one of the best performers globally. While the average Costco counts 68,000 households as members, the Shanghai store had nearly five times that amount, Costco said at the time. The retailer is doing so well, in fact, that it plans to open at least three more stores in the country over the next couple of years.Costco has good reason to expand in China, where a growing middle class is flocking to higher quality products and premium brands. Retail sales in China are expected to grow to more than $6 trillion by 2024, up 16% from 2019, according to estimates published by eMarketer in June. The research firm predicted China could overtake the United States as the world's largest retail market this year.Read MoreCostco's first China store was so popular it shut down traffic. But can it keep the buzz going?But Costco also faces risks. The pandemic has put a damper on consumer spending as unemployment rises and people grow more budget conscious. For the first seven months of the year, retail sales in China fell nearly 10% from a year earlier, government statistics showed, and eMarketer is expecting a 4% decline for the year. Competition from well-established players is also stiff. Sam's Club, a US warehouse chain owned by Walmart (WMT), has been operating in China for more than two decades and is accelerating its expansion in Shanghai, Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces \u2014 the same regions Costco is eying for expansion.Some US firms that do business in China are also wary as tensions between the two countries escalate and Washington threatens to ban the use of Chinese tech by American companies. Still, Costco is optimistic about its chances.\"We have been successful in other countries, and believe our business will work well in China,\" Costco's chief financial officer Richard Galanti told CNN Business via email. \"We typically open 2-3 locations in a country, and see how they operate over the first couple of years,\" he added. \"We are off to a good start with our first opening last year.\"Hot items for 'foodaholics'Like in the United States, Costco has lured customers with big discounts and jumbo-sized products. Rotisserie chicken, boxes of croissants, muffins and Tiramisu cakes are all big hits.It's only $4.99. But Costco's rotisserie chicken comes at a huge price\"To get a rotisserie chicken, one has to wait at least half an hour,\" a Weibo user wrote last December on the Chinese social media platform. \"The three places at Costco you need to line up: cakes, pizzas and rotisserie chicken. But foodaholics think it's so worth it!\"Xinmin Evening News, a government-owned newspaper in Shanghai, described the scramble for the chicken last August like this: \"Everyone who snatched a rotisserie chicken is a winner at life!\"People try to get a roast chicken at the first Costco outlet in China on opening day last August. Products unique to Chinese customers are enormously popular, too. On a call with investors in December, Galanti highlighted one top seller: sea cucumbers, which are considered to be a prized delicacy in China. In traditional Chinese medicine, the animal is said to have healing properties and can treat joint pain and arthritis. The cucumbers are usually sold dried and packaged, and can be eaten after being soaked in hot water for hours. A pack of 10 sold for 549.90 yuan ($80) at the Costco Shanghai store, though the retailer told CNN Business this week that it has stopped carrying the cucumbers right now. It intends to bring them back in October for the Mid-Autumn Festival, a major holiday in Asia when revelers admire what's believed to be the fullest moon of the year.Edible sea cucumbers, like these at a seafood store in Hong Kong, are considered to be a prized delicacy in China.The store also sparked a buying frenzy last September when it launched Moutai Flying Fairy, the flagship brand of baijiu sold by Chinese liquor maker Kweichow Moutai. Baijiu is a drink distilled from sorghum and rice that is immensely popular in China. Shoppers scrambled to pay 1,499 yuan ($217) for a half liter bottle of the spirit, its standard retail price. The cost of the liquor is typically much more elsewhere because of hoarding and speculation.Crowd controlThe popularity of some of its products also created an unexpected problem for Costco during the pandemic: the need to fend off crowds.The company, for example, suspended the sale of rotisserie chicken in February citing anti-virus considerations.\"This is to prevent customers from flocking together and lining up,\" the store said in a May statement. Costco has yet to start selling them again.Crowds were massive at Costco's opening in Shanghai last year.The store paused sales of croissants in late February, too, for similar reasons, Xinmin Evening News reported. Costco started selling croissants again in June. The huge crowds during the pandemic also raised concerns among government authorities. In late February, Shanghai regulators visited Costco for an inspection and warned the store to control its foot traffic. They told the store that fewer than 1,000 people could be inside at any given time, according to a government statement.Galanti admitted Costco felt \"a little bit\" of an impact from those limitations.But overall, \"Covid did not impact our business in China in a meaningful way,\" he told CNN Business.Expansion is on the horizon, but there are challengesAfter the success of the Shanghai store, Costco is already working on plans to branch out in China. Galanti said the company wants to open another store in Shanghai and two more in the nearby cities of Suzhou and Hangzhou. The Shanghai and Suzhou stores are expected to open next year. Retail analysts say Costco has several factors working in its favor as it grows in China.\"Costco is appealing to China's middle class consumers, because they have a strong demand for high-quality products at competitive prices,\" said Michelle Huang, a Shanghai-based consumer food analyst at Rabobank. She added that Costco's in-house brands, such as Kirkland Signature, are trusted by customers because of their quality.And the price of the membership program is attractive to middle-class households. Costco's annual membership program, which accounts for the bulk of its profit, is cheaper in China \u2014 it costs 299 yuan ($42) per year compared to $60 in the United States. Costco is a warehouse club, which requires consumers to pay an annual fee to shop in its stores.How Kirkland Signature powers Costco's successCostco is also good at adapting to local customers in China, said Charles Chan, senior Asia retail analyst at IGD, a UK-based research firm focused on the food and grocery industry.Before the brick-and-mortar store opened in Shanghai, Costco sold goods for five years on Alibaba's e-commerce website, Tmall. The online sales helped Costco gain a better understanding of the Chinese market, Chan said.But as Costco expands, it could face more direct competition from long-established rivals.Sam's Club, for example, recently announced plans to open a flagship store in Shanghai next year. The US chain already has 26 stores in China and could have as many as 45 by the end of 2022. Sam's Club already has 26 stores in China, including this one Nantong. The company could have as many as 45 in the country by the end of 2022.The battle over physical stores is only part of the equation, too. Chan noted the need for Costco to beef up its presence online.Sam's Club parent Walmart has an alliance with JD.com. The Chinese company's delivery network helps Sam's Club fulfill online orders quickly in the markets its stores are in, Chan said. In Shanghai, for example, Sam's Club promises one-hour delivery to local customers who order online. Costco has yet to offer such delivery services through its Shanghai store. And while it still offers online sales and delivery through Tmall, the product selection is limited compared to what is available in the brick-and-mortar store.Chan said he would not be surprised if Costco spends more time bolstering its presence on WeChat, the Chinese super-app where Costco offers product recommendations and promotions. The company also has its own Costco China app. (WeChat, notably, has been threatened with a US ban that some worry could make it harder for American companies to do business in China.)\"Adding new features such as home delivery would enable the retailer to be more aligned with its competitors,\" Chan said, adding that it would help Costco retain existing members and find new ones.",

        "content": "San Francisco (CNN Business)To an outsider's eye, Canyon Cannabis might've appeared like a small-town, rinky-dink pot shop. Housed in an unassuming building off a scenic  highway, it was the lone dispensary in the 500-person city of Gates, Oregon. Inside, though, visitors were greeted with an explosion of color and sound. A vintage Pioneer sound system bathed the room in music \u2014 Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Wonder, old ska and blues \u2014  from owner Thorin Thacker's personal collection of 3,000 vinyl records he kept on site. Sometimes the soundtrack was provided by Thacker himself, a musician and Latin dance instructor, who would pick on an 1882 Fairbanks & Cole banjo or tinker away at the century-old piano placed in the lobby.Thorin Thacker, owner of Canyon Cannabis, sings and picks at a banjo on April 11, 2018, at the Gates, Oregon, dispensary. Canyon Cannabis was destroyed by the Beachie Creek Fire on Sept. 8, 2020.Beyond the experience, the dispensary's curated selection of craft cannabis and hand-blown glass pipes from local artists helped attract a loyal clientele that included Portlanders from 80 miles away. Read MoreNow it's all gone. On Sept. 8, the Beachie Creek Fire tore through the canyon, devastating Gates and leveling Canyon Cannabis. The fire burned so hot, it turned the safe to Swiss cheese, disintegrating the money left inside. The locally made glass pipes and bongs melted into a clump of art. Metal scraps were all that remained of the banjo and piano.\"I'm just all cried out,\" Thacker said. \"I've got no more tears left.\"Canyon Cannabis is one of thousands of pioneers that got in on a fast-growing, multibillion-dollar industry on the West Coast. The recent wildfires underscore the unique hurdles that cannabis businesses encounter in trying to survive.For operators who lost everything to the deadly wildfires, there's little recourse and only the shakiest of safety nets. Insurance companies, like banks, are reluctant to serve cannabis businesses because marijuana remains a federally illegal substance. And because of that illicit status, the enterprises don't qualify for federal disaster aid. Thacker estimates his losses at more than $250,000. His inventory could not be insured. After pouring his heart and soul into his enterprise, and paying almost $500,000 in local, state and federal taxes in nearly three-and-a-half years of business, Thacker's back to square one. \"It just doesn't seem to be fair that after we provide so much tax income that we don't get to participate in any of the reasons you rely on the government to help you out,\" Thacker said.  And even for operators whose cannabis businesses and plants were spared, the wildfires still present a mess of potential issues such as smoke damage, contamination, smaller buds, stressed out plants and end products that might not pass regulatory or consumer muster. The burnt remains of Canyon Cannabis' sign. The Gates, Oregon, dispensary was destroyed Sept. 8 by the Beachie Creek Fire.\"We work all year for this period of time, when we're working around the clock to bring in a successful harvest,\" said Nathan Howard, co-founder and president of East Fork Cultivars, which specializes in breeding and growing CBD-rich, adult-use cannabis and hemp. \"Most of our success in 2021 is determined by how successful we are during these six weeks, the end of September and October.\"For several weeks now, the situation has been touch-and-go, he said. The 155,000-acre Slater Fire has surrounded much of Takilma, the small Oregon community home to East Fork Cultivars' 33 acres. Flames have come within a mile. Howard and a small crew have stayed back to tend to the plants as ash and charred leaves rained down from above. They put out spot fires that cropped up nearby, and they scraped and dug down to the mineral soil to create strips of fire lines to serve as barriers. \"The fire burnt right up to the fire line and no further,\" he said. Still, Howard said, \"It's hard to celebrate or feel good because our neighboring towns, Phoenix, Talent, Ashland, Detroit, they're either all gone or mostly gone.\"The remains of Canyon Cannabis, a Gates, Oregon, dispensary that was destroyed Sept. 8 by the Beachie Creek Fire.East Fork Cultivars has been through fire seasons before, so Howard remains optimistic that the product the farm has been growing won't suffer ill effects.However, the farm lost two weeks of full operations and is now behind the ball on the all-too-critical harvest season. One bad year might not break most farmers, but it could spell ruin for East Fork Cultivars and other cannabis cultivators that don't have access to crop insurance or federal aid, he said. 'Stillness in the air'On Sept. 9, as a red glow filled the sky and ash fell like a light snow, Tina Gordon feared the worst.The historically massive August Complex Fire shredding its way across Northern California was heading toward Gordon's Moon Made Farms, a 40-acre cannabis cultivation site in Humboldt County, California.\"There was a stillness in the air that was absolutely terrifying,\" Gordon said. \"No birds. No wildlife. Everything had taken cover.\"East Fork Cultivars, an adult-use cannabis and hemp cultivation business in Takilma, Oregon. The Slater Fire surrounded Takilma, but hasn't caused fire damage.Growing cannabis, especially outdoors, is an incredibly costly and risky affair, especially when those operations can't easily be insured, but Gordon said her primary goal was to protect human and animal life while also preserving the possibility for recovery. Gordon opted to follow the mandatory evacuations and grabbed some cannabis seeds as she left. \"The stuff doesn't matter, the vehicles don't matter, the infrastructure really doesn't matter,\" she said. \"It's the land and the genetics.\" Gordon returned nine days later, after the evacuation orders had lifted, to find the farm had been mostly spared. They lost some of the vegetables that weren't on automatic irrigation, but the cannabis plants remained.The focus now has been on cleaning the plants, preparing them for harvesting and testing to ensure the products are safe and free from impurities, she said. Concern has risen among some cultivators in California about the potential damage caused by the heat, ash and smoke, said Jill Ellsworth, founder and chief executive officer of Willow Industries, which specializes in decontamination and remediation for cannabis flower and harvested plant material.She said some clients reported instances of smoke damage, premature flowering and other factors that can lower the quality and potency of cannabis or even ruin entire crops.If the environmental stress results in smaller buds and lower yields, that could lead to losses up and down the supply chain, Ellsworth said. Complete lossesIn Oregon, 20 licensed cannabis businesses had operations in wildfire burn zones and 12 were complete losses, according to the Oregon Liquor Control Commission, which oversees the state's cannabis industry. \"But we suspect the impact is greater than what we can find on a [Geographic Information System] map,\" said Mark Pettinger, spokesman for the OLCC's recreational marijuana program.A cast iron plate and piano wire are the remnants of a century old piano once located in the Canyon Cannabis dispensary in Gates, Oregon. Canyon Cannabis was destroyed by the Beachie Creek Fire on Sept. 8, 2020.In addition to the destroyed operations, other cannabis businesses have reported partial crop loss and damages to infrastructure and irrigation systems, according to OLCC.The placement of the Oregon wildfires has been particularly challenging for hemp growers as the fires have eaten into one of the nation's most productive regions for the crop.As of Sept. 16, about 17% of the state's hemp cultivation sites were facing imminent danger from wildfires, according to an analysis from Hemp Benchmarks, a provider of data and research for the industry.The smoke, ash and other fire-generated debris pose a significant contamination risk to hemp crops, especially those that will supply the smokable hemp market, according to the report. Some crops were damaged by the high winds that accelerated the deadly blazes and others suffered water loss as power outages interrupted irrigation systems, Hemp Benchmarks found. \"Hemp [grown for CBD] is a pretty high-cost crop to farm; people are putting a decent amount of money in per acre relative to growing corn or soybeans,\" Adam Koh, Hemp Benchmarks' editorial director, told CNN Business. \"That's sort of an extra kick in the pants right there.\"Melted clumps of what were locally made glass pipes and bongs sold at Canyon Cannabis dispensary in Gates, Oregon. Canyon Cannabis was destroyed by the Beachie Creek Fire on Sept. 8, 2020.Last month, Oregon Senator Ron Wyden and other Oregon Congress members introduced a bill that would allow state-legal cannabis businesses to qualify for disaster recovery programs. Like most cannabis-centric legislation, the bill is expected to face stiff opposition in the Republican-led Senate.Canyon Cannabis' Thacker said he's hopeful for legislation of that nature, but \"I'm certainly not going to hold my breath.\"For now, he's relying on a GoFundMe campaign to help generate funds to rebuild Canyon Cannabis either in Gates or the nearby Mill City, where he once served as mayor. \"That's a lot of magic to recreate,\" Thacker said. \"I know we can do it, but it's not going to be easy.\"",

        "content": "In the 1989 US blockbuster \"Back to the Future II,\" time traveler Marty McFly orders a Pepsi Perfect at Hill Valley's futuristic Cafe 80s. It was an iconic moment of product placement. But if you look very closely at a different scene showing future McFly as he video-conferences a co-worker in 2015, another brand makes a cameo appearance.That drink was called Pocari Sweat. And despite its name \u2014 unappetizing to native English speakers \u2014 it's a well-known Japanese sports drink across Asia and the Middle East. If you look very closely, you'll see a small blue and white Pocari Sweat can in the center of this frame.Though the film's creators didn't have a product placement deal with Pocari Sweat, they had given their art department a general directive to include Japanese elements in the scenes depicting 2015, says Bob Gale, the producer and writer of \"Back to the Future II.\"\"In the late '80s, Japanese companies were buying a lot of American companies, notably Sony purchasing Columbia Pictures and Panasonic buying Universal. Japanese video games were the market leaders, Japanese cars were outselling American cars, and we thought this trend would continue well into the future,\" says Gale.Read MoreThe Japanese powerhouse of the '80s didn't last, but Pocari went on to become a force in the sports beverage market.Last year, 270 million bottles were distributed across more than 20 countries and regions. Around the same number were distributed in Japan, according to Otsuka Pharmaceutical, the Japanese company that makes it. Amid the pandemic, the company donated more than 1.2 million bottles to hospitals and governments across its markets.     Launched in 1980, Pocari Sweat was inspired by the rehydrating effects of an IV solution. The ingredients include water, sugar, citric acid, magnesium, calcium and sodium. Pocari replenishes water and electrolytes \u2014 a set of minerals your body needs to function \u2014 lost through sweat. The beverage is to many Asians what Gatorade is to Americans, and Lucozade is to the British.But, the brand, which turns 40 this year, is virtually unheard of in the West. A drink that mimics sweat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFour Pocari Sweat facts\n\n\n\n\n1980\n\n\n\nPocari Sweat is launched in Japan.\n\n\n\n\n1982\n\n\n\nOtsuka starts exporting Pocari Sweat to its first overseas markets in Hong Kong and Taiwan.\n\n\n\n\n1990s\n\n\n\nPocari Sweat becomes the first non-alcoholic drink in Japan to hit a cumulative shipment value of over $1 billion.\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\nOtsuka establishes a health beverage subsidiary in Mexico, the country that sparked the idea for Pocari Sweat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Otsuka Pharmaceutical\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPocari's story starts with Rokuro Harima, an Otsuka employee who got food poisoning during a business trip to Mexico in the 1970s. At hospital, doctors told Harima to replenish his energy with fizzy soda drinks. But when Harima spotted a doctor drinking from a pouch of IV solution to rehydrate himself after performing surgery, he had an idea.Otsuka had also been producing IV solutions for hospitals since 1946. Harima put two and two together: He wanted to create a tasty, drinkable IV. In the 1960s, he had helped fine-tune the flavor of Otsuka's \"Oronamin C,\" a carbonated nutritional drink targeted at weary businessmen needing a midday pick-me-up. Now the \"king of taste,\" as his peers called him, had set his sights on creating a new market in Japan.Gatorade had been sold in the US since the 1960s. But in Japan in the 1970s, sports drinks were uncharted territory. Non-alcoholic carbonated beverages, such as Coca-Cola and Mitsuya Cider, and orange and apple juices dominated the domestic market, according to the Japan Soft Drink Association (JSDA). But as Japanese white-collar workers powered Japan's economic boom, households gained spending power. People became more health-conscious and Coke sales waned, according to Mark Pendergrast, the author of \"God, Country and Coca-Cola.\" Harima got to work.     Back in the laboratory, he and a team of researchers had discovered that the concentration of sweat was different for people doing sport compared to those just going about their day. They wanted a drink \u2014 with properties similar to sweat \u2014 that could hydrate people whatever they were doing. Researchers developed dozens of prototypes, but they all tasted too bitter. The breakthrough came when they added a dash of citrus powder juice to their translucent solution, eventually refining the formula to two samples with differing sugar levels. Researchers put those solutions to the test by climbing a mountain in Tokushima prefecture in southern Japan, says Jeffrey Gilbert, a spokesman at Otsuka. They concluded that the less sugary version went better with exercise.The formula for Pocari Sweat was born. All they needed was a name and a logo. What's in a name?With its literal nod to perspiration, Pocari Sweat's name has bemused many native English speakers. The first part of its name was chosen for its sound. \"Pocari\" comes off as vaguely European and is easy to pronounce but has no meaning, Gilbert says. As Japan absorbed Western influences in the post-World War II years, European languages were seen as chic and exotic. English slogans adorned everything from billboards to T-shirts, lunch boxes and pencil cases.     A poster for the first Pocari Sweat can launched in Japan in 1980.The word \"sweat,\" on the other hand, conveys the drink's practical purpose. Back in the 1980s, most carbonated and soft drinks were sold in bold red, orange and white containers, according to the JSDA. Yet given the high turnover rate in the Japanese beverage market, Akihiko Otsuka \u2014 then president of Otsuka Pharmaceutical \u2014 knew he had to make a statement. Reminiscent of breaking ocean waves, Pocari's cool blue and white cover was an outlier in terms of design. It was a risk engineered to catch the eye of curious consumers.Creating a new marketPocari Sweat was not a smash hit when it landed in Japanese stores in 1980. \"Because this drink category didn't exist in Japan, people didn't know what to make of it,\" says Gilbert. It didn't have Coke's dark coloring and signature sweet fizz. Nor was it like Suntory's energy drink Regain, which appealed to businessmen prepared to work 24-hour shifts. Instead, Pocari Sweat promised to keep people hydrated.Early marketing campaigns focused on the dangers of dehydration. Television commercials and posters targeted everyone from people with hangovers to sports enthusiasts. For several years, the company handed out free samples at saunas and sporting events. Salespeople went door-to-door to promote it.\"Back then, Japan didn't have as many supermarkets or vending machines as it does today. Shoppers bought drinks at mom and pop stores, so Otsuka made an effort to reach out to people and familiarize them with Pocari's taste and function,\" says Kiyomi Kai, a spokeswoman at the JSDA.When Pocari Sweat first launched in Japan, it struggled to win over consumers.Despite the struggle to launch, Gilbert says giving up wasn't an option. \"Otsuka is very, very sticky and persistent in what it does on both the drug and consumer side \u2014 it goes in deep and stays there,\" he says.Eventually, its efforts paid off. In the mid-1990s, Pocari Sweat became Japan's first domestically produced non-alcoholic drink to hit a cumulative shipment value of over $1 billion.Sold primarily in hot countries across Asia and the Middle East, Gilbert says the hydrating message behind Pocari products \u2014 which now include powder and jelly \u2014 speak to those markets. Private vendors are selling the drink in Western nations, too. But Otsuka never dreamed of dominating the West.Looking to Asia By 1983, Gatorade held 86.5% of the sports beverage market in the United States. In Otsuka's eyes, Western markets were saturated, says Gilbert.Otsuka had exported its IV solutions to Japan's neighbors since the 1960s, so it made sense to ship them to locations near Japan rather than to send them via air freight to America. Besides, the company didn't want to pay for expensive supermarket shelf space in the US.     Pocari Sweat was launched in Japan as the economy boomed. Otsuka predicted that the level of economic growth would spread across Asia. By the 1980s, anti-WWII sentiments toward Japan, which had colonized many parts of Asia, had gradually waned in the region. Japan was now seen as a viable business partner.The drink hit shelves in Hong Kong and Taiwan in 1982 and in Singapore, Bahrain, Oman and Saudi Arabia the following year, along with a slew of other markets over the next decades. The strategy of investing in Asian and Gulf markets for the long haul bore dividends. Before the coronavirus pandemic hit, the Asian economic zone \u2014 spanning the Arabian Peninsula to Australia \u2014 represented 50% of global GDP and two-thirds of global economic growth, according to Parag Khanna, the author of \"The future is Asian.\"The region's spending power was growing, and Pocari Sweat was well-placed to ride the wave.Overcoming cultural hurdlesOtsuka saw huge potential in Indonesia, a country of 273 million people, which is now the company's biggest market outside Japan. But Otsuka knew it had to rethink its marketing strategy for the predominantly Muslim nation. For example, it didn't make sense to advertise Pocari Sweat to Indonesians as a means to rehydrate after a bath or when they had a hangover, as they did in Japan and the Philippines. In Indonesia, people take showers instead of baths. And, as Islam forbids alcohol, there's no Indonesian word for \"hangover,\" says Yoshihiro Bando, the president director of Otsuka's Indonesian branch, in a 2015 YouTube video.Otsuka focused on carving out a niche in the healthcare and sporting community. But even then, the drink only took off after medics started using it as an emergency tonic. #PocariSweat for HANGOVER. Aim for #BetterHealth. Choose POCARI SWEAT. Available in stores nationwide. pic.twitter.com/jW5o8MMHRF\u2014 Pocari Sweat PH (@PocariSweatPH) September 5, 2013 In 2010, a dengue outbreak swept Indonesia. That year, the incidence rate spiked to over 80 people per 100,000 compared to 60 the year before.Symptoms for dengue include vomiting, high fever and internal bleeding, in severe cases. Patients need to stay hydrated, as that allows platelets\u00a0\u2014 tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding \u2014 to mature. Spotting an opportunity in the market, Otsuka partnered with healthcare experts and government officials to promote Pocari Sweat's hydrating powers. Healthcare workers started recommending it to their patients to prevent dehydration, according to researchers from Telkom University in Indonesia. As a vital hydration booster, Pocari became known as a \"form of first aid\" \u2014 deployed in the fight against everything from dengue fever to diarrhea. But it didn't take long for Pocari's image to shapeshift. Pop culture meets ion supplyFrom 2016, running became a popular activity among Indonesians, according to Jakarta-based advertising agency Olrange. It partnered with Otsuka between 2015 and 2018 to produce a series of campaigns to expand Pocari Sweat's appeal. Along with sports campaigns dubbed #SafeRunning and Born to Sweat, Olrange leveraged Japan's pop culture to attract younger consumers.In 2018, Olrange launched a series of online videos \u2014 dubbed \"the most kawaii (cute) web series in Indonesia\" \u2014 featuring Haruka Nakagawa and Yukari Sasou, two Japanese Pocari Sweat ambassadors and celebrities popular in Indonesia.It \"captivated\" Indonesian youngsters, says Stephanie Putri Fajar, an account director at Olrange. \"We gave them (Nakagawa and Sasou) a platform to portray the active life of the youth who lose ions (sweat) through a lighthearted six-part friendship and adventure series on YouTube called 'Onigiri The Series,'\" says Putri Fajar. The videos shows the young friends sharing rice balls, going to school, hanging out and experiencing teenage life as peppy tunes play in the background. That call to youngsters is driving Otsuka's strategy as it fosters markets at home and abroad, according to Tomomi Fujikawa, an analyst at Euromonitor International.Moonshot drinkFour decades ago, there were only five types of soft drinks \u2014 a category that JSDA says includes carbonated beverages as well as teas and mineral water \u2014 competing for space in Japan's beverage market. But the category has expanded a lot since then. In 2019 alone, there were 6,491 types of soft drinks on sale in Japan, and companies introduced 1,074 new products, according to the JSDA. All of them vie for coveted space in the nation's convenience stores and roughly 5 million vending machines, says Kai, the JSDA spokeswoman.\uff3c#\u521d\u97f3\u30df\u30af \u304c #\u30dd\u30ab\u30ea\u30b9\u30a8\u30c3\u30c8 \u30a2\u30f3\u30d0\u30b5\u30c0\u30fc\u306b\u5c31\u4efb\uff01\uff0f\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u6691\u3044\u590f\u3092\u4e57\u308a\u5207\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u5168\u4e16\u754c\u306e\u7686\u3055\u3093\u306b\u767a\u4fe1\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u3001\u521d\u97f3\u30df\u30af\u304c #\u30dd\u30ab\u30ea\u30b9\u30a8\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30f3\u30d0\u30b5\u30c0\u30fc \u306b\u5c31\u4efb\uff01\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30c4\u3067\u4e00\u5c64\u30a2\u30c4\u304f\u306a\u308b2020\u5e74\u306e\u590f\u3092\u3001#\u30dd\u30ab\u30ea \u3068\u4e00\u7dd2\u306b\u5143\u6c17\u306b\u697d\u3057\u307f\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046\uff01#MEIKO #\u30df\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30ab\u30ea #\u5bcc\u58eb\u8475 #YuNi pic.twitter.com/Xksk3G1ocV\u2014 \u30dd\u30ab\u30ea\u30b9\u30a8\u30c3\u30c8\u3010\u516c\u5f0f\u3011 (@pocarisweat_jp) December 20, 2019 In Japan, Pocari Sweat is stocked in convenience stores, vending machines, supermarkets and drug stores. While ubiquity helps, Otsuka has worked hard to make the brand relevant, says Roy Larke, a marketing professor at the Waikato University in New Zealand.For instance, in 2020, Otsuka recruited virtual pop star Hatsune Miku as a brand ambassador ahead of the now-postponed Summer Olympics, to appeal to a new generation of young people.A Pocari Sweat store in Hong Kong. That cycle of refreshing Pocari Sweat but sticking by its signature blue-and-white look and message of hydration, has allowed the brand to outlast its competitors and thrive.\"Some brands are designed specifically for the convenience store market, so they have a three-to-six month lifespan for a particular recipe, but Pocari Sweat isn't like that,\" says Larke, who is also the editor of intelligence website JapanConsuming. \"It's an enduring long-term brand that Otsuka has really developed over the last 50 years, and today it's that endurance and long history in Japan that has kept it going.\"CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki contributed to this report from Tokyo.",

        "content": "White molds wearing disposable gloves whizz by on a conveyor belt in a promotional video for the world's biggest glove maker, Top Glove. \"Gloves can keep us out of harm's way, wherever we may be and whatever we may be doing,\" the narrator says, his voice booming over the company's logo and its motto, \"Top quality, top efficiency.\"  Demand for disposable gloves \u2014 the kind often associated with sterile hospital rooms \u2014 has surged during the coronavirus pandemic as health care workers rush to secure the supplies they need to treat the disease and protect themselves.  The Malaysia-based Top Glove and its local rivals have benefited enormously from that need: Some 60% of the world's glove supply comes from Malaysia, according to the Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association (MARGMA). More than a third are exported to the United States, which for months has led the world in coronavirus cases and deaths. But with extra demand comes renewed scrutiny of how these Malaysian companies treat their workers, particularly foreign staff recruited from neighboring countries. Read MoreLabor rights activists who spoke to CNN Business said that practices reported by former workers contain elements of forced labor. Some authorities have taken note of such concerns, putting pressure on Top Glove and other manufacturers to ensure their workers are treated well.  In July, for example, the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency barred products made by Top Glove and one of its subsidiaries, TG Medical, from being distributed in the country after finding \"reasonable evidence\" that the companies were using forced labor, according to an emailed statement. It said the evidence revealed alleged instances of \"debt bondage, excessive overtime, retention of identification documents, and abusive working and living conditions.\"Top Glove said in August that it was making good progress with authorities to resolve the issues. In a statement, the company said it had started reimbursing the recruitment fees foreign workers paid to agents who the offered them the job. Top Glove says it expects to repay a total of 53 million Malaysian ringgit ($12.7 million). A spokeswoman told CNN Friday that upgrades to foreign workers' accommodation, as requested by US authorities, had been completed. But labor rights activists say the problems blighting Malaysia's glove industry aren't easily fixed. Concerns remain about the treatment of foreign workers in a rapidly growing industry, some of whom are enticed with the promise of high-paying jobs but are left saddled with debt.  Gloves on the production line at Top Glove's factory in Shah Alam on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur, August 26, 2020.World's glove factory In recent decades Malaysia has emerged as a leading supplier of disposable gloves, due to its vast rubber plantations and government support for an industry that generates billions of dollars in sales each year. Revenue from glove exports is expected to reach 21.8 billion Malaysian ringgit ($5.2 billion) in 2020, according to MARGMA, as Covid-19 drives demand for Malaysian-made gloves up around 30%, from 170 billion to 220 billion pieces. Market leader Top Glove says it produces around a quarter of the gloves used worldwide in its 46 factories, mostly in Malaysia. On June 11, the company recorded its best-ever quarterly net profit of 350 million Malaysian ringgit ($84 million), more than four times the figure it brought in during the same quarter last year. The firm said monthly sales orders surged 180% due to the rise in demand for rubber gloves during the coronavirus pandemic.  Since the beginning of the year, Top Glove's share price has rocketed fivefold on the Bursa Malaysia. Top Glove founder Lim Wee Chai was worth $2.5 billion in June, according to Bloomberg calculations that excluded the value of his pledged shares in the company. Behind Top Glove, other large Malaysian players include Hartalega and Kossan. Together, the three companies employ nearly 34,000 workers. Most of them have been hired from abroad, with a majority coming from Indonesia, Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar, according to several experts interviewed by CNN Business.   \"Most Malaysian workers don't want to do the poorly paid, hard and dangerous work offered in these factories,\" said Bent Gehrt, from the Workers' Rights Consortium, a labor rights NGO based in Washington D.C. An employee monitors latex gloves on an automated production line at a Top Glove factory, February 18, 2020.To hire foreign laborers, Malaysian rubber glove companies rely on recruitment agencies and subagents in the workers' home countries, with whom they sign contracts containing hiring targets, sometimes through another layer of intermediary agencies located in Malaysia, according to Andy Hall, a labor rights activist.  These intermediaries get paid little or nothing by employers for their services and so they charge the workers large sums to secure them passports, work visas, security clearance, medical exams and flights, he said. Bangladeshis bear the highest costs (between $2,000 and $5,000), followed by Nepalis ($800 to $2,000) and workers from Myanmar ($800 to $1,200), according to company audits and interviews with workers from Top Glove, Hartalega and Kossan. Former Top Glove employee Taha, whose name has been changed to protect his identity, said he was charged 165,000 Nepali rupees ($1,390) by an agent who came looking for workers in his Nepali village in 2013. \"I had to take out a loan with a very high interest rate to pay for this fee,\" said the 27-year-old worker.Seven years later he still hasn't repaid all of it, he said. His recruitment agency, Trust Nepal, told CNN Business that prior to January 2015 workers had to pay for their flights and passport-related costs. But the company said it had never collected such a large sum from a single worker. Taha says he paid some of the money to the subagent who came to recruit him in his village.Experts interviewed by CNN Business said these practices contain elements of forced labor as defined by the International Labour Organization such as abuse of vulnerability, deception in recruitment, payment of recruitment fees and abusive working conditions. Top Glove, Hartalega and Kossan say they've taken measures to prevent the exploitation of workers by recruiters. In recent years, all three companies have introduced \"zero-cost recruitment\" policies, meaning the agencies in the workers' home countries are not allowed to charge them fees related to their employment \u2014 the companies cover all their costs.  Top Glove records statements from workers in their home country and upon arrival in Malaysia to make sure they are not asked to pay fees, said a spokeswoman. Hartalega workers are briefed about the company's zero-cost recruitment policy before they leave home and are asked upon arrival if they've had to pay anything. The same question is asked three months into the job, the company said.  In its annual report, Kossan also said that it interviews employees multiple times before and after their arrival in Malaysia to determine if they've paid recruitment fees. If they have, they're refunded. \"[We] will not hesitate to sever ties with unscrupulous agencies that exploit our workers,\" the report added.Foreign recruiters In practice, zero-cost recruitment policies can be poorly enforced, and some workers are still paying fees, especially to subagents, according to experts and industry insiders interviewed by CNN Business. A Nepali auditor, who wishes to stay anonymous for fear of reprisal, told CNN Business he had interviewed several workers hired by Top Glove through recruitment company Trust Nepal, who had paid in excess of 100,000 Nepali rupees ($843) in recruitment fees, as recently as March of this year. \"The money was handed over in cash to a subagent, so as to leave no paper trail,\" he said. Recruitment fees coupled with low wages effectively put the workers in a situation of debt bondage, where they can't make enough money to repay their debts and leave their jobs, according to Hall, the rights activist.  When an agent came to a village in a remote part of Nepal in 2014, offering work for young men willing to move to Malaysia, Daarul immediately signed up. \"I was told I would be working in a supermarket and earning a good salary,\" said Daarul, who is using an alias because he fears losing his job. \n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is often a single bathroom and toilet for up to 25 workers, so they have to get up 2 or 3 hours before work to queue up for these facilities\"Andy Hall, a labor rights activist\n\n\nDaarul, a former subsistence farmer, says he was asked to pay 120,000 Nepalese rupees ($1,011) in agency fees to take the job. But when he landed in Kuala Lumpur, he was told he'd be working in a Kossan glove factory for a lower wage than promised. \"I felt tricked,\" he said.  Six years later, he's still working in the factory and dreams of going home but can't afford to. \"I work very hard every month, but my salary is still not enough to support my family, let alone pay for a return flight,\" he said. Daarul says every month his employer, Kossan, provides him with a 150 Malaysian ringgit ($36) advance on the following month's salary, as he has run out of money. \"I feel trapped in this job,\" he sighs. CNN Business contacted Daarul's agency in Nepal but did not receive a reply. Kossan did not respond to requests for comment.Workers like Taha and Daarul are paid Malaysia's monthly minimum wage, which is now 1,200 Malaysian ringgit ($287) in 57 major towns after an increase of 100 ringgit in 2020. They can earn more with overtime, according to pay slips seen by CNN Business. But workers at all three of the major glove companies said in some instances their wages are deducted.Reasons could include being caught smoking, not meeting daily quotas, or failing to wear protective equipment, according to an auditor who requested to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals, and who has interviewed dozens of workers. When asked if they deduct fines from workers' salaries, Top Glove and Hartalega said they do not withhold employees' wages or impose penalties. Kossan did not reply. Injuries and deaths  The work itself is strenuous and dangerous, say some observers. Temperatures near the ovens used to heat the glove-shaped molds once they have been dipped into rubber can reach 60 degrees Celsius (140 Fahrenheit), according to several experts. At Kossan, auditors observed a lack of fans or ventilation in extremely hot areas, according to an unredacted audit of a Kossan factory conducted in June 2019. The noise levels were also excessive, with several workers suffering from hearing impairment, according to the audit. Workers are also exposed to dangerous chemicals, said K. Veeriah, from the Malaysian Trades Union Congress. As part of the production process, the gloves need to be dipped into tanks containing hazardous acids and chlorine, he said.  Activists are urging big brands to eradicate traces of human rights abuse in Xinjiang from their supply chainsIn the past, several Top Glove workers have suffered from chemical burns, according to photos purportedly taken in 2019 and seen by CNN Business. \"The workers often don't have any protective equipment, or they can't bear to wear it because it is too hot in the factory,\" said Hall, the labor rights activist.In October 2018, a Top Glove Bangladeshi worker lost an arm after falling into a stone crushing machine, according to a video of the accident seen by CNN Business. He told CNN Business he had started working at the factory nine months earlier, after paying 330,000 Bangladeshi takas (around $3,900) to a recruitment agency in Bangladesh.   After the accident, he was awarded 52,000 Malaysian ringgit ($12,477) in compensation. Around half of that was donated by former co-workers, according to a letter of acknowledgment seen by CNN Business. Due to the accident, he is no longer able to work and make a living, he said.   The Top Glove spokeswoman said the company \"regretted the unfortunate accident where our worker lost an arm.\" But she said he had not followed safety protocols. The worker said he was trying to free an object stuck in the stone crushing machine at the time of the incident. The spokeswoman said chemical burns can occur when there is \"improper handling of chemicals or if workers do not wear the protective equipment provided.\"  The spokeswoman acknowledged that temperatures can reach 60 degrees Celsius (140 Fahrenheit) in certain parts of the factories, but she said the workers are not stationed in the immediate vicinity of ovens and are provided with cool air blowers.  From this month, Malaysian companies can be fined for not providing adequate accommodation for foreign workers.Workers from all three companies described abusive behavior by supervisors. \"We were treated like dogs,\" said former Top Glove worker Taha. \"Supervisors would shout at us and call us names if we made a mistake or didn't meet the targets.\"  One incident, captured on closed circuit television in August 2019, shows a Top Glove supervisor swatting a worker's face with paper and then grabbing him by the collar. Top Glove admitted the incident took place but called it \"an isolated case\" and said the supervisor involved was dismissed. Auditors also found evidence of physical abuse at Kossan and Hartalega factories. Workers at Hartalega reported multiple instances of beatings, including some delivered away from CCTV cameras, according to the unredacted 2019 audit. The Hartalega spokeswoman said the company does not tolerate any form of abuse, whether verbal, physical or mental and has a code of conduct which prohibits this. A handful of abuse cases did occur, she said, adding that strict disciplinary action was promptly taken. In its 2019 annual report, Kossan says workers have easy access to grievance channels to report alleged abuses. For workers, life can be just as hard off the factory floor. Auditors who visited a Kossan hostel described rooms accommodating 48 people with piles of rubbish, razor blades and broken furniture strewn everywhere. \"There is often a single bathroom and toilet for up to 25 workers, so they have to get up 2 or 3 hours before work to queue up for these facilities,\" said Hall, who visited numerous dorms last year, in the course of his own research.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was told I would be working in a supermarket and earning a good salary ... I feel trapped in this job.\"Daarul, a former subsistence farmer\n\n\nAt one Kossan factory, workers are housed in stacked containers and the heat gets unbearable, according to a source with knowledge of the company's housing arrangements. Kossan did not reply to requests for comment, but its annual report states that the welfare of its workers \"remains a foremost priority.\" Top Glove and Hartalega both said they go beyond Malaysian government guidelines. In its 2020 annual report, Hartalega said it provides free leisure and sporting activities and daily shuttle buses to town. It has recently invested $21.5 million to build a new accommodation complex for its workers, the spokeswoman added. In a statement in late August, Top Glove said it \"continues to enhance its migrant workers' working and living environment and facilities.\"Malaysia has recently updated its laws to set minimum standards for accommodation provided to foreign workers. Under the rules, each worker should have a sleeping area of at least three square meters. And, at least one toilet and bathroom should be provided for every 15 employees. From September, employers who don't meet basic standards can be fined 50,000 Malaysian ringgit or around $12,000. Supplies to the US   The Malaysian rubber glove industry relies heavily on the US market, which absorbs 36% of its products, according to MARGMA.Between May and November 2019, Top Glove, Kossan and Hartalega sent supplies to more than 60 American buyers, according to US customs data. The three companies sent a total of 629 shipments representing 10,175 metric tons of goods to the United States during the six-month period.Among the buyers were large medical suppliers like Owens & Minor, Dyad Medical Sourcing, Medline Industries and Cardinal Health, which between them provide disposable gloves to hospitals, medical practices, hospices, labs and pharmacies.The industry also deals with large dental suppliers, such as Benco Dental, Henry Schein and PureLife Dental, and providers of industrial safety equipment such as Honeywell and MSC Industrial Supply. Other buyers catered to the packing and shipping, janitorial or food industry. A handful of Top Glove buyers supplied beauty salons. CNN Business reached out to Top Glove, Kossan and Hartalega's 24 largest buyers over the six-month period examined but only received four replies. Honeywell has done a limited amount of business with Kossan and the primary market for these gloves is outside of the US, a spokesman told CNN Business. The company launched an investigation into its Malaysian supplier following CNN's questions last November and confirmed last month that it was still ongoing.Owens & Minor, which buys gloves from Hartalega and Kossan, makes great effort to ensure its suppliers operate in an ethical manner and regularly works with auditors to monitor them, a spokeswoman said. Henry Schein and Medline said their supplier codes of conduct prohibit the use of forced labor and they take all allegations seriously.Industry attentionTop Glove isn't the only Malaysian glove maker whose work practices have been recently scrutinized by US authorities. For several months from the end of last September, the CBP banned imports from WRP Asia Pacific, a smaller supplier, after receiving information that the company may be using forced labor. US halts import of goods suspected to have been made with forced laborThat order sent Malaysia's rubber glove industry into a frenzy. Malaysia's Minister of Human Resources, M Kula Segaran, convened a town hall meeting with all the big rubber glove companies, including Top Glove, Kossan and Hartalega, according to minutes from the meeting provided to CNN Business. Kula promised the Employment Act would be amended to incorporate a section on forced labor and that social audits would become compulsory from 2021.  \"There is a lot of compliance to be done and there is a lot of work to be carried out to ensure worker's rights, accommodation and general welfare is protected,\" MARGMA said in a statement released on October 2 of last year, a day after the WRP ban was announced.  The ban was lifted in March after the US Customs and Border Protection ascertained that WRP Asia Pacific was no longer using forced labor to produce gloves, according to a statement. In July, the company said it had begun to reimburse workers who had paid \"unethical recruitment fees.\"Other industry members are also starting to examine their work practices. On August 10, Hartalega announced that it would start reimbursing 40 million Malaysian ringgit ($9.6 million) in recruitment fees to its workers by the end of 2020.  Countries once praised for their handling of coronavirus are struggling to deal with new outbreaksTop Glove said this week it had submitted an independent auditor's report to US Customs and Border Protection and hopes for an \"expeditious upliftment\" of the ban. But Hall, the labor rights activist, says the broader industry needs to do much more to improve the working conditions of foreign employees. \"Many of the serious forced labor indicators identified in the 2019 audits remain systematic within the workplaces of the Malaysian rubber gloves industry,\" he said. And the companies' remedial actions don't go far enough, he added. ''Workers hired under so called zero-cost recruitment policies since 2019 are not included, although they often paid considerable fees, nor are workers who already resigned or who were hired before the arbitrary dates set by the companies.\" As a former Top Glove employee, Taha is not eligible to be reimbursed for his recruitment fees. He moved back to Nepal in October 2019 \u2014 and is still paying off debt. \"I went to Malaysia to help support my six siblings and parents, but I wasn't able to set aside any money during my time there and I am still in debt.\"  \"I'm worse off than before I left.\"",

        "content": "Eight months ago, Meng Hu quit her job as a flight attendant in Guangzhou, China to pursue her dream of becoming an online star.She gave notice to the airline just before Covid-19 slammed aviation, created a makeshift home studio in her one-bedroom apartment, and started filming herself talking \u2014 a lot.Hu, 27, is an influencer, with a twist. Since January, she's been working full-time as a live-streaming host on Taobao, Alibaba's (BABA) eBay-like online marketplace. There, she has built up a following of more than 400,000 fans.\"I've been talking nonstop,\" Hu said, laughing. \"My throat gets really hoarse. [In this job,] you need to talk a lot, because your mood is contagious. You can't just do things halfway. Only when you talk enthusiastically can you get your audience excited.\"Hu is part of a rising class of creators in China who are racing to get in on live-stream shopping, an emerging form of retail that has grown into an industry worth an estimated $66 billion. Although the trend has been part of Chinese internet culture for years, analysts say the coronavirus pandemic has made it mainstream.Read MoreEven the Chinese government has voiced its support, calling the industry the \"new engine\" of e-commerce growth and encouraging live-streaming as a solution to unemployment, which has risen sharply in China due to the pandemic. Live-stream shopping is a blend of entertainment and e-commerce. Viewers buy goods online from people who show off their latest finds \u2014 from lipsticks to laundry detergent \u2014 in real-time videos. Many liken the concept to TV shopping channel QVC, but the Chinese model is distinctly more modern, mobile and interactive. Hosts can give their fans discount coupons and flash deals in real time, while viewers can click to send their favorite stars virtual \"gifts.\"But as Hu and other newcomers are discovering, making it in this field is not easy. The industry is tough, and few workers can parlay their skills into a successful career.Meng Hu, a live-stream shopping host in Guangzhou, speaking to fans on Taobao Live. Hu quit her job this year to pursue her dream of becoming an online star.The Covid-19 boomIn the first half of this year, \u202fmore than 10 million e-commerce live-streaming sessions were hosted online, according to the government.As of March, there were 560 million people watching shopping live-streams in China, an increase of 126 million compared to last June, according to a report published by the China Internet Network Information Center. Almost half of them used live-streaming for online shopping, according to the report.Sandy Shen, a research director of digital commerce at Gartner, said live-stream shopping would have taken two or three years to become a mainstream trend in China prior to the pandemic. Instead, it took two or three months, she said.Experts project the industry still has a lot of room to grow. In 2019, China's live-stream shopping market was worth 451.3 billion yuan ($66 billion), according to iResearch, a Shanghai-based market research firm. That could more than double to almost 1.2 trillion yuan (roughly $170 billion) this year, the firm forecast in July. Analysts predict the trend could catch on overseas, too. In parts of Southeast Asia, for example, Alibaba (BABA)-owned Lazada allows live-streamers to promote merchandise. And Amazon (AMZN) has a home-shopping video-streaming hub for its Western users.A day in the lifePart of the allure of venturing into this world is the prospect of a big payday. Brands routinely announce tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in sales in a single sitting. Top influencers can earn millions of dollars a year, according to Taobao, which compiles a ranking of the highest paying hosts and their estimated earnings. And even prominent business leaders are getting in on the act.But experts note that there are also scores of people at home wringing their hands.\"If you are just a normal, ordinary merchant selling on Taobao, and you are just using all your own employees, with no pre-marketing, you're probably just going to have a couple of hundred people watching. And they will maybe just stop for five or 10 seconds, and if they find it's not interesting, they'll just leave,\" said Shen.      \nKim Kardashian West promoting her fragrance to Chinese fans on Alibaba's Taobao live-streaming platform in November. \"Even one of the world's top influencers needs the right platform to sell into China,\" Alibaba said.\nFor people like Hu, the live-stream host in Guangzhou, the ongoing boom presents both \"a chance and a challenge.\"\"Viewers might have doubled, but there's probably about seven or eight times more new live-streamers now,\" she estimated. \"So many people like me have joined live-streaming, and are selling products and doing the [same] thing.\"Hu said she now earns in a month what she used to make in a year. But the hours can be grueling. She typically spends seven hours a day speaking on live-stream to her fans, offering deals on everything from vacation getaways to snacks to skincare products. After that, she spends hours each night reading up on products she plans to sell.\"Every day I wake up, I work, work, eat, work, and sleep,\" she said. \"It is hard.\"     The production takes a village. More than 20 people work behind the scenes to support Hu's work, directly or indirectly, by her estimate. That includes teams from a local talent agency that help her choose which products to feature, what discounts to offer fans and how to plan her filming schedule. Her husband helps out with odd jobs and occasionally pops up on camera, too. Hu and her team make money, meanwhile, through a couple of avenues: The companies pay for their products to be featured, and then Hu earns a commission off of each sale she makes. A typical commission rate varies from 6% to 16% depending on the platform, according to the iResearch report.The new gig economyLike most of the world, China has been rocked by an economic and jobs crisis this year, although the country has recently shown signs of a rebound. To help keep people afloat, the government has seized on the trend by encouraging people to live-stream.This February, for example, China's Ministry of Commerce encouraged e-commerce platforms to help farmers sell their produce online, particularly through live-streaming.Even Chinese President Xi Jinping has taken notice. In March, he visited a village in northwestern China where he spoke with residents who were selling agricultural goods over live-stream, according to the state-run news agency Xinhua. Xi praised the power of e-commerce, saying it had great potential to help keep people out of poverty.In May, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security even added \"live-streaming host\" to its list of recognized professions, meaning the government would start counting those people as officially employed. State media said this would help the country create new \"job pools\" to balance out the loss of manufacturing jobs that had been wiped out by the pandemic.  Chinese President Xi Jinping talking to a live-streaming host during the set-up of a live shopping session to market local produce in Jinmi, Zhashui county, northwest China's Shaanxi province in April.Some local governments are even working to transform their towns into live-stream shopping hubs. In Guangzhou, authorities are hoping to turn the city into China's \"live-streaming capital.\" To that end, in June they held a three-day live-stream shopping \"festival,\" where businesses conducted more than 200,000 broadcast sessions, according to state media.\"As the economy recovers, the job market is in fact expanding,\" said Fu Linghui, a spokesperson of the National Bureau of Statistics, at a press briefing last month. He singled out \"gigs like live-stream shopping\" as the kind that were \"vital\" to stabilizing the market.\"For the government, they see this as a trend that can help keep the economic growth, and also help keep the employment,\" said Shen. \"They view this as an opportunity, and it is. I think if you create the infrastructure, give support, it can definitely help lift the economy.\"The hard truthEven so, the industry's impact on the economy is probably limited, according to Xiaofeng Wang, a senior analyst at research firm Forrester. She noted that live-stream shopping is still a very small percentage \u2014 estimates suggest around 5% \u2014 of the country's e-commerce market, and a tiny share of the overall retail sector.\"I don't think live-stream e-commerce alone will save the economy,\" Wang said.Of the 400,000 people that China's Commerce Ministry says hosted a live-stream shopping event in the first half of 2020, it's likely that only 5% to 10% will succeed and earn a living, estimated Iris Pang, chief economist of Greater China at ING.She said it was hard to predict how many jobs had been added to China's economy so far because many people working in this field were not full time.\"I think it will boost job numbers only by a little,\" Pang said. \"It shouldn't be big enough to move the needle.\"\"People who want to do this should be expected to work really hard,\" said Heng Xia, CEO of NStar MCN, a Hangzhou-based talent agency. Nice represents Hu and more than 150 other online personalities. \"This is a high intensity job,\" Xia said. \"Most people can't really do it. We've hired many new graduates, and some of them couldn't make it.\"      \nAlibaba co-founder Jack Ma and celebrity influencer Li Jiaqi participating in a challenge to sell lipsticks over live-stream in 2018. Live-stream shopping has existed in China for years, but the trend has taken off in recent months.\nThat's the question currently facing Seven Zhou, a live-streamer in Hebei province who's trying to carve out a new career on the short video app Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok. In January, the former consultant was put on furlough after his company lost clients due to fallout from the pandemic. Like Hu, he decided to quit with high hopes of making it big.But as time went on, Zhou said, he realized that goal was more unattainable than it looked. Douyin requires anyone hoping to become a seller on its platform to have at least 1,000 followers, but he found it tough to reach that milestone. To find an audience, he started hosting two-hour live-stream \"chats\" each day. The experience was painfully \"awkward,\" he said. Few viewers stopped by his channel. His videos flopped, hardly getting any \"likes.\"Eight months on, Zhou is wondering whether he is cut out for this business. The 30-year-old hasn't yet decided whether he'll throw in the towel, but says he is disillusioned with the industry and all the stories of overnight success.\"It hasn't gone well,\" he said. \"The system isn't as simple as it seems.\"",

The man driving the Ferrari, police say, was Vorayuth \"Boss\" Yoovidhya, the heir to a family fortune that Forbes estimates to be worth $20.2 billion.Vorayuth was subsequently charged with five criminal counts, including speeding, hit-and-run, and reckless driving causing death, but the case stalled for years as the billionaire scion repeatedly missed or postponed prosecutors' summonses. Authorities believe he left Thailand in 2017.Vorayuth Yoovidhya is arrested at Thong Lor police station in Bangkok, Thailand, on September 3, 2012. For years, the family of the police officer killed in the crash, Sgt. Major Wichien Klanprasert, were left in limbo.Read MoreThen on July 23, Colonel Sampan Luangsajjakul of the Royal Thai Police confirmed that the Office of Attorney General (OAG) had decided to drop all charges against Vorayuth, who police said was aged 30 at the time of the accident, not 27 as they had previously indicated.The decision to drop the charges thrust the case back into the spotlight \u2014 and angered Thais who have long felt that the country's legal system unfairly favors the rich. Some called for a boycott of Red Bull products. Others said the decision not to prosecute Vorayuth was the latest and most blatant confirmation of a perceived culture of impunity of the elite in Thailand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The public sentiment is that there are different standards when it comes to the rich and the poor.\"Ekachai Chainuvati, law lecturer at Siam University in Bangkok\n\n\n\"The public sentiment is that there are different standards when it comes to the rich and the poor,\" said Ekachai Chainuvati, a law lecturer at Siam University in Bangkok.Since then, public pressure has mounted, prompting multiple inquiries by the OAG, police, the lower House of Parliament and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha, who vowed to \"ensure justice in Thai society without dividing it along social class lines.\"From there, the story has veered wildly \u2014 from the death of a key witness to the OAG's decision to instruct police to investigate Vorayuth for two potential charges that could lead to his indictment.Through it all, the young heir and his immediate family have maintained their silence. But at a time of reignited protests for political change, many people are demanding more accountability for the actions of the rich and powerful at the very top of Thai society.  A life of luxuryBetter known by his nickname \"Boss,\" Vorayuth grew up in one of Thailand's most prominent families. His grandfather, the late Chaleo Yoovidhya, created the Red Bull energy drink \u2014 a fizzy mix of vitamins, sugar, and caffeine \u2014 and built it into a global empire. Born to impoverished Chinese immigrants in northern Thailand, the self-made billionaire started his career selling pharmaceutical supplies. In 1956, he founded his own company, TC Pharmaceutical, which developed over-the-counter drugs for headaches and fever. Chaleo soon became convinced a bigger market was out there for energy drinks. He invented Krating Daeng, a sweet, caffeine-powered beverage that first became popular with day laborers and truck drivers.A Thai man drinks a bottle of Krating Daeng, an original Thai version\nof popular drink Red Bull, in a store in Bangkok in July 2001.In 1984, Chaleo teamed up with Austrian entrepreneur Dietrich Mateschitz and later launched Red Bull, a carbonated version of Krating Daeng that would become a hit among athletes, partygoers, college students and late-night workers worldwide.After Chaleo's death in 2012, his son Chalerm Yoovidhya took over the business, according to Forbes. Chalerm and his family currently rank second on the site's list of 50 richest Thais, behind the agribusiness behemoth of the Chearavanont brothers.The Yoovidhya family owns about half of the Red Bull global business, which sold 7.5 billion cans of the drink across 171 countries in 2019. The family's empire includes real estate interests, restaurants, a winery and Thailand's only official importer of Ferrari cars.The parent company of the Thai Red Bull brand, TCP Group, has tried to distance itself from the controversy around the alleged hit and run. In a statement, it said Vorayuth had \"never assumed any role in the management and daily operations of TCP Group, was never a shareholder, nor has he held any executive position within TCP Group.\"      Like his father and grandfather, Vorayuth kept a low profile and was little known among ordinary Thais prior to the 2012 accident. When police officers followed the path of leaked oil to the Yoovidhya mansion, an unnamed man on the premises initially claimed that he was driving the Ferrari at the time of the crash, police said at the time.He was later fined $200 for giving false statements. Vorayuth was taken to a police station for questioning, where he allegedly admitted driving the car and hitting the motorcycle, but claimed he was suddenly cut off by the bike, police said at the time. He was released on bail on a bond of 500,000 baht, about $16,000.In the ensuing years, Vorayuth did not appear in court for several summonses from public prosecutors, with his attorney claiming he was sick or on business trips abroad.  The prosecutor finally issued an arrest warrant against him in April 2017 \u2014 almost five years after the incident. But it was too late \u2014 Vorayuth had already left Thailand, police said.Interpol issued an international wanted notice against him, but it no longer appears on the site. Vorayuth's whereabouts are officially unknown.CNN has attempted to contact Vorayuth and his immediate family through their lawyer but has not received a response.Thickening plotFor a long time, the case against Vorayuth seemed to be on hold.By September 2017, the statute of limitations had expired on four of the charges \u2014 including speeding and hit-and-run. Police had until 2027 to prosecute the most serious charge \u2014 reckless driving causing death.  That is, until the OAG dropped the case, as CNN reported on July 23.Net Narksook, the public prosecutor in charge of the case, did not offer any reason for the decision, but a letter issued by the OAG informing police of the decision suggests it was based on \"new evidence\" that claimed Vorayuth was not speeding at the time of the fatal crash. According to the letter dated June 12, Vorayuth was originally accused by police of traveling at an estimated speed of 177 kilometers per hour (110 miles per hour) \u2014 well above the 80 kph (50 mph) speed limit. However, the letter said the police expert who initially assessed the Ferrari's speed changed his estimate in 2016 from 177 kph to 79 kph \u2014 just below the speed limit. It did not explain how he reached the lower number.Two \"additional witnesses\" told prosecutors in December 2019 that the Ferrari was only moving around 50 to 60 kph (31 to 37 mph) at the time of the crash, according to the document.Thai police officers inspect a Ferrari car on September 3, 2012. One of the witnesses, Jaruchart Mardthong, claimed that he was driving a pickup truck behind the police officer, and saw his motorcycle suddenly cut in front of Vorayuth's Ferrari right before the crash, the letter said.Jaruchart first gave a statement to police a few weeks after the crash, but was asked to give an additional statement last December, according to the OAG and police. He was expected to be called again to give evidence as multiple investigators examine why the charges were dropped. However, in the early hours of July 30, Jaruchart, too, was killed in a motorcycle crash.Death of a witness  The sudden death of a key witness at the height of the controversy reignited public uproar. CCTV footage seen by CNN showed a man police identified as Jaruchart riding his motorcycle on an empty road in the northern city of Chiang Mai, before colliding with another motorcycle traveling in the same direction.Lt. Gen. Prachuab Wongsuk, commissioner of the Provincial Police Region 5, said the two men had met that night while drinking at a bar, and Jaruchart agreed to follow his new acquaintance to another venue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline\n\n\n\n\nSept 3, 2012\n\n\n\nSgt.

Prachuab said the collision appeared to be an accident, but police hadn't ruled out a possible \"murder motivation.\" \"We are investigating suspects surrounding Jaruchart,\" he said.   To some observers, the timing was curious \u2014 Jaruchart's death came one day after Prime Minister Prayut announced that he had set up a committee to investigate the dropping of Vorayuth's case.Others have raised another point of suspicion \u2014 Jaruchart's cellphone had gone missing after the crash. Jaruchart had been working for the owner of local football club. Lt. Gen. Prachuab told CNN that another of the club's employees had told police that he took Jaruchart's cellphone after the crash and deleted all the photos. He said he wanted to remove any evidence of his association with Jaruchart because he was going to run in a local election and didn't want to be associated with the Red Bull scandal, Prachuab said.As speculation swirled around the cause of the incident, Prayut ordered a halt to Jaruchart's cremation scheduled for August 2 and Chiang Mai police seized his body for a second autopsy. The second autopsy showed Jaruchart had suffered a fractured skull, a ruptured spleen, a broken rib bone, and bleeding in his brain and stomach \u2014 injuries consistent with a traffic accident, authorities said. Results of the first autopsy have not been released. Then on Tuesday, August 4, another twist. The OAG's committee cited more \"new evidence\" \u2014 expert opinion from Sathon Vijarnwannaluk, a physics lecturer at Chulalongkorn University who estimated that the Ferrari was traveling at 177 kph, matching the initial conclusion drawn by the police expert.The committee said it had heard interviews Vijarnwannaluk gave to several Thai media outlets the previous week, in which he claimed to have been a part of the original team tasked by police to examine the crash. He said his team used CCTV footage to calculate the speed of the Ferrari, and had concluded that it was traveling at 177 kph.   The OAG committee claimed that Vijarnwannaluk's assessment was not included in the police case file, and thus the public prosecutor was unaware of his estimate when he decided to drop the charges. The committee said the public prosecutor didn't see the 177 kph estimate anywhere in the police report.An OAG spokesman said Vijarnwannaluk's expert opinion led the committee to recommend that the OAG order police to reopen the investigation into the speed of Vorayuth's Ferrari at the time of the crash for the possible charge of reckless driving causing death, said Prayut Bejraguna, deputy spokesman for the OAG.The committee also suggested police investigate an additional drug allegation against Vorayuth, as it said blood tests conducted following the accident showed traces of the drug, Prayut said. On Monday, the OAG announced that it was acting on both recommendations and gave police investigators 10 days to file their report.\"The main message we are sending today is that the OAG has revived the case, given breath back to it, so it can... bring 'Boss' back to the justice system,\" said Prayut, from the OAG. A family scandal The scandal has not only angered Thai society, it's driven a wedge through a family that has long remained silent on the issue.In a rare statement last month, some members of Vorayuth's extended family apologized \"for the news of our family member that has caused anger, hatred, and dissatisfaction that is increasingly voiced in society.\"\"We have to issue this letter to express our regret over this incident and to confirm our respect for a justice system which should provide justice to all without discrimination,\" the statement said. Vorayuth Yoovidhya walks to get in a car as he leaves a house in London on April 5, 2017. The family of the police officer killed in the 2012 crash, have expressed surprise at the latest turn of events. In an interview with \"Hone-Krasae,\" a popular Thai television talk show, his sister-in-law Nattanun Klanprasert said she was shocked to hear that new evidence had emerged.She said police had previously told her there were no eye-witnesses to the crash.\"Now, Sr. Sgt. Wichien became the one who committed recklessness instead and caused the accident. He became wrong?\" she said, her voice raised.The charges against Vorayuth have not been reinstated \u2014 yet \u2014 but he is still a wanted man. Vicha Mahakun, head of the independent probing committee set up by Prime Minister Prayut, said Wednesday the arrest warrant against Vorayuth is still in place, after a court asked police to withdraw their previous request to revoke it.Police have until August 20 to interview witnesses and compile a report for the OAG \u2014 only then could a case that has intrigued and angered the Thai public for years take another step towards a possible conclusion in court.

        "content": "Adraint Bereal was preparing for his end-of-semester thesis showcase a few months ago, gearing up for a summer internship at an ad agency in New York. A 22-year-old recent graduate of the University of Texas at Austin, Bereal is the first in his family to attend college, and he was intending to use his design degree to start a career in photography and design.  Then he got an email saying his internship had been rescinded due to Covid-19. Around the same time, he learned that his program department had made the decision to move his senior exhibition, which he'd been working on for more than two years, completely online. The project, called \"The Black Yearbook,\" documents the lives of Black Texan college students, who make up less than 5% of the student body at UT Austin. \"You spend your four years building up to this one moment where you get to finally announce who you are and what type of designer you want to be,\" he said. \"It was a big shocker. I was depending on that internship to help me transition to being in New York full-time.\" Bereal now faces what he describes as a \"burning question mark\" in his life regarding what he'll do next and where he will go. His hours at his part-time job have been reduced since the pandemic, a lease he shares with four roommates ends in July, and he worries about how he'll pay off the roughly $10,000 he owes in student loans.  \"If I stay in Texas, how long am I staying for? Am I going to be able to afford where I'm going? Am I going to be able to have money to support myself? These are all things that are kind of running around in my mind,\" he said.  Bereal graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in May with his BFA in design. He was set to start an internship at an ad agency in New York this summer, but his offer was rescinded due to Covid-19. Read MorePrior to the pandemic, Generation Z had offered the prospect that inequality in America might finally narrow, at least by some measures. Now, with economists expecting that youth will suffer the greatest coronavirus-related economic setbacks among America's workers, those hopes are dimming. Made up of people born after 1996, Gen Z is more diverse and \"on track to be the most well-educated generation yet,\" according to the Pew Research Center.  Before the pandemic hit, the strong economy offered more pathways for youth to start their careers. Their earnings potential was promising. And the tight labor market meant employers had to widen their net when considering diverse job applicants.  Tatjana Meschede, a senior scientist and associate director for the Institute on Assets and Social Policy at Brandeis University, said there had been \"room to hope\" that, although longstanding economic disparities would not completely disappear, at least they might shrink among today's young people.  \"The pandemic cut that all short,\" she said.\u202f Now, just like the millennials who entered the labor force after the 2008 financial crisis, members of Generation Z will likely experience permanent declines in earnings. But those setbacks aren't evenly distributed. Among young workers, Black youth will likely bear one of the largest burdens. Black youth suffer from higher levels of unemployment and often earn lower wages than their White peers with the same levels of education. They're also less likely to come from families that have the wealth to provide substantial financial support during a downturn. And among those who go to college, Black students, on average, carry higher levels of student debt than their White peers. These challenges can also be true for other minority groups \u2014 but for Black youth, these economic setbacks can be particularly difficult to overcome, experts say. A weak job market now, coupled with family financial strains, can force young workers to make tough sacrifices early on. Those decisions can change the course of their career paths, impacting their health and wellbeing, as well as big lifetime decisions like homeownership, marriage and having children further down the road. \"It would be a mistake to just see it as just a money thing, just thinking about how some communities have wealth and some communities don't. It is a whole ecosystem of opportunities,\" said Mehrsa Baradaran, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, and author of \"The Color of Money: Black Banks and the Racial Wealth Gap.\" The scarring effects of a recession  Four months ago, Gen Z was enjoying the strongest labor market in 50 years. After the coronavirus hit, that disappeared within weeks.  The United States is now grappling with massive unemployment \u202fand a tough economy amid a health crisis and widespread unrest. What was once the best job market is now the worst since the Great Depression, with the unemployment rate at 11.1% for the country overall, and at 20.7% for workers in their teens and early twenties.Racial inequality starts early, just as people are first entering the work force: 19.6% of Whites ages 16 to 24 were unemployed in June, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but the unemployment rate for Blacks of the same age was 27.7%. A year ago, before the pandemic, it had been 8.2% for White youth and 14.9% for Black youth.  \n\nYoung people of any ethnicity graduating into an economic crisis suffer from sustained higher unemployment rates, persistent earnings losses and increases in poverty that can last for 10 to 15 years after they leave school. They also suffer from increases in mortality and lower socio-status later in life, according to a report by UCLA economist Till von Wachter.  But in addition to hurting the population broadly, economic crises exacerbate preexisting inequalities. That's because in weak job markets, employers tend to be more selective, elevating discrimination and biases against certain groups. And among workers, those who have the weakest financial safety nets often don't have the luxury to pursue personal aspirations but are instead forced to make decisions based on economic necessity.  \"Every time we don't deal with the structural inequality, we essentially are put in a position where it's harder to recover,\" said Andre Perry, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of \"Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America's Black Cities.\" He further cites that's because inequalities typically compound once a new crisis hits.  Student loan debt can perpetuate existing disparities Student debt is yet another factor that can limit the kinds of decisions Black students can make concerning their own futures. Often, these sacrifices take the form of accepting low-wage job opportunities with fewer worker protections, picking a less expensive college over their dream school, or having to work multiple jobs to pay the bills.  \"The biggest thing for people just graduating now is the issue of debt,\" said Olugbenga Ajilore, a senior economist for the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think-tank.\u202f Black college graduates owe an average of\u202f $23,400 in loans when they finish their\u202f bachelors'\u202f degrees, versus $16,000 for their\u202f White peers, according to a 2016 study by Brookings, a nonpartisan think-tank. Four years after finishing college, Black graduates owe an average of\u202f nearly $53,000, mainly due to accrued interest and graduate school borrowing. That's nearly twice\u202f as\u202f much as\u202f White graduates over the same time frame.  \n\nIn addition to the job crisis, Black youth and their families struggle with the potential high costs of student loan debt. With less access to generational wealth, taking on student loan debt is often the only choice for many Blacks students to be able to attend college. During the current crisis, however, some Black students are deciding that's a level of risk they can't afford to take, and are pivoting their plans as a result.  Nana Prempeh, 17, from Somerset, New Jersey, \u202fcomes from a family of nurses;\u202f it's a profession she always saw herself pursuing. It was her dream to attend Rutgers University, a public college in New Jersey, and if money wasn't an issue, she would have gone there. But after weighing the costs of a four-year degree and the weak economy during the pandemic, Prempeh decided to attend community college instead. In a couple years, she'll reevaluate whether it's worth it to transfer to a four-year university or a two-year nursing school program, but for now, the lower cost of attending a community college offers a financial cushion in an uncertain economy.  Nana Prempeh, who recently graduated from high school, plans to attend Raritan Valley Community College in the fall. She decided to attend a community college rather than a four-year university to save costs during the uncertain economy. She noted that she sees hardly any of her classmates weighing the same tradeoffs, but she's confident about the call she's made for herself.  \"I don't want to have student loans. I'm probably going to look back years from now and be like 'Wow! This was a really good decision,'\" Prempeh said. \u202f There are potential downsides, however. Attending a community college is of course typically cheaper than attending a four-year university, but for most people getting an education beyond the associate's degree conferred by a two-year school means being more competitive in the job market and earning more over the course of their career.  \"In the end, it's the four-year college degree that sets you up for life,\" said Meschede.And for Prempeh specifically there are added risks. Nursing programs have been a popular choice for students, now and before the pandemic, and if Prempeh does decide to try to go to one after completing a two-year program, it's possible she could end up waitlisted or denied admission altogether.  Research shows the student debt crisis has impacted Black borrowers more than any other ethnic group. Black students are more likely to borrow at higher rates and take out more student loans.  The percentage of Black students who take out loans to attend college tops 90%, compared to 66% of White students, according to a report by the Student Borrower Protection Center, a consumer advocacy group. Additionally, Black students pay back their debt at an average rate of 4% annually, compared to 10% for White students. \"Student debt is so much larger than it's ever been before and that also puts constraints on the kind of jobs you can get,\" said Ajilore, senior economist for the Center for American Progress. Ajilore adds that if Black youth are faced with the option to take their dream job, it could limit their ability to pay down debt and make other long-term financial decisions. Not to mention, some Black parents of Gen Z children are still recovering from the Great Recession of 2008.  \"If they didn't have to go through the Great Recession, they would have a greater ability to help their kids go through this pandemic,\" Ajilore said.  According to the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances, the median net worth of White families in 2016 was $171,000, nearly ten times the net worth of Black families at $17,150.  \"Parents and students are in the same boat so to speak, because Black parents have been less likely to have wealth. Particularly after the last housing bubble, it's very difficult for families to get ahead,\" Perry said.  \n\nMamourou Kone, an 18-year-old from the Bronx, is set to \u202fattend Nazareth College in Rochester, New York, \u202fin the fall. Kone worked several odd jobs in high school, from retail to babysitting, and he intends to work multiple part-time jobs \u2014 on campus, through a work-study program, and off-campus, too \u2014 after starting college. Mamourou Kone near his home in the Bronx, New York. Kone planned to attend Nazereth College in Rochester, New York in the fall, but he may stay closer to home if he cannot find a job in Rochester. Working while in college is a necessity for Kone, who needs to help his mother with financial expenses back home. But a second wave of Covid-19 could put a damper on his college plans if it means he cannot find a job near campus. It's a possibility that has him contemplating staying in the Bronx, where he thinks he may have more work opportunities than in Rochester. If he's unable to find a job while in school, Kone said, he would consider transferring to a college near the Bronx, instead.  He was looking forward to moving to Rochester, in part because it guaranteed new opportunities away from the neighborhood where he grew up. Kone says many of the opportunities he'd get in college in Rochester are either limited back home or don't exist at all. Going to college away from New York City would also let him expand his network beyond the friends and family he grew up with in the Bronx \u2014 something he feels could benefit his career going forward.  \"College will completely open my eyes. A lot of people in my community don't go to college and don't see themselves going to college,\" Kone said. I always saw myself going to college, it's always been a goal of mine. I'm glad I stuck with it.\" Persistent job discrimination and bias still existThe racial opportunity gap shows no signs of narrowing. Beyond the vast unemployment numbers are other factors that affect Black youth such as low-wage job opportunities and job discrimination. It's a reality that\u202f recent UT Austin graduate Bereal says he struggles with constantly.\u202f\u202f For Bereal, his dream job is a creative one, in photography and graphic design. But now amid uncertain times, he's considering pivoting towards tech, where more opportunities exist for designers. A career in tech could mean more money for him, but it's not the career he would have chosen \u2014 and it's the kind of choice that a White student would be less likely to have to make.  \"This is one of those moments where you kind of have to do what you have to do to make ends meet,\" he said.  But beyond having to make potential sacrifices with his career path, Bereal says he also faces what he considers \"a slap in the face\" when it comes to job inequities and discrimination within the industry.  \"Because there aren't very many Black men, in particular, that\u202fare dominating in the creative space, I feel like I have to work three times as hard to be valued as someone that could be paid equally,\" \u202fhe said. Black job applicants' race has pervasive effects on their employment prospects, on average. Black Americans are twice as likely to be unemployed compared to\u202f Whites, and when they are employed, those who work full-time earn\u202froughly 21% \u202fless than their White peers.  \"We know that job discrimination has infected many different markets and that discrimination is the drag that helps maintain wealth disparities,\" Perry said. \u202f According to a 2003 study by researchers from the University of Chicago and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, job applicants with popular \"white sounding\" names like Greg and Emily resulted in a 50% more likelihood of getting callbacks from employers than applicants with popular \"black sounding\" names like Lakisha and Jamal. The biases and discrimination faced by Black job seekers exist in both good and bad economies. But in weak economies, when employers are unable to hire a wider pool of applicants, that bias and discrimination is often amplified. The persistent racial discrimination and bias Black job seekers face in the labor market limits their opportunities to gain better paying jobs and benefits compared to their White counterparts. This ultimately disrupts their job growth trajectory and earnings potential down the line, which experts say, can impose significant costs on Black households and their ability to generate wealth \u2014 only exacerbating long-term disparities exposed by the racial wealth gap.  \"The racial wealth gap leads to who has more police, who has better school options, who has job offers after graduation, who has family wealth so that they don't need student loans, who is trusted and criminalized, and who's resume sounds smarter and not. A lot of these things go back to these wealth gaps,\" Baradaran said. \"All of this is interrelated.\"  Closing the racial wealth gap: 'It requires stimulus'The Black-White wealth gap doesn't just put a significant strain on Black people. It also limits the growth of the US labor market and economy.  That's what one McKinsey & Company report says. The 2019 report on \"The economic impact of closing the racial wealth gap\"\u202festimates that US GDP could increase by 4% to 6% if the racial wealth gap were closed by 2028. Experts say, however, that closing the gap will require strategic policy changes. The same was true before the impact of the coronavirus. \"It requires stimulus,\" said Perry. \"It will take hundreds of years, even if you remove racism, for this Black-White wealth gap to close. And so, at some point, you need an infusion of stimulus and an infusion of cash.\" Perry proposes policies that eliminate some of the debt of students who come from low net-worth families and create opportunities to help young people generate financial security, such as homeownership. \"Black people, on average, put most of their savings in their home. But the last couple of crises really wiped out the wealth in those homes,\" Perry said. \"We need other ways to build wealth besides homeownership.\" He adds that other wealth building opportunities such as baby bonds \u2014 federally-funded savings account for children started at birth \u2014 or reparations can aid in eliminating preexisting gaps.  \"If we can figure out ways to eliminate student loan debt, get more homebuyers, and young people in jobs with 401(k) or other retirement plans, we'll start to see some movement,\" Perry said. \"But there's no way around it \u2014 at some point you have to eliminate debt and build wealth.\"\u202f As for Black graduates like Bereal, he says the only way through these tough times is to keep pushing forward.  While his summer internship was supposed to be the launchpad into his dream career as a photographer and graphic designer, Bereal says The Black Yearbook is still giving him that opportunity. After raising more than $20,000 on GoFundMe, Bereal is working to produce an exhibit and mass produce copies of the yearbook. \"I've always just tried to really go out of my way to show up and show out and show people what I'm worth and what the quality of my work is,\" Bereal said. \"And make it known that I'm growing and I'm going to continue to grow.\"Bereal is the creator of 'The Black Yearbook', a project highlighting the stories of Black Texan college students on campus, who make up only 5% of the student body.",

        "content": "In the year before Dave Dukes killed a man who was trying to rob the store where he worked, he'd witnessed three other robberies. After each of them, Dukes, 28, would say later, he'd asked his supervisors at Dollar General to put in a security guard. But, according to Dukes, his bosses didn't do that \u2014 though, because of how many robberies he'd been through, they did start sending him out to train employees at other stores.After the third robbery, Dukes started bringing a gun to work.Then, in October 2019, the fourth robbery happened.Read MoreAccording to the local prosecutor's office, a man entered the store with a gun and demanded money from the cashier. When Dukes tried to intervene, the man \u2014 Roosevelt Rappley, just 23 years old \u2014 pointed his gun at Dukes. Then Dukes pulled out his own gun and shot Rappley, killing him.  A grand jury in Ohio reviewed the case and found Dukes \"acted lawfully under the circumstances,\" according to the prosecutor's office.But by then Dukes was out of a job, allegedly having been fired by Dollar General for violating company policy. Dollar General's 2019 policy said that possession of a firearm on the company premises may result in termination.Dave Dukes stands in his lawyer's office in Dayton, Ohio in March. Dukes was a Dollar General clerk who shot and killed a man during an armed robbery. It was the fourth robbery he had witnessed on the job.Dollar General declined to say why Dukes was terminated, saying in an email that it does not comment publicly on specific employment situations. The company said it does not retaliate \"against employees who make good faith reports of safety concerns.\" It also maintains that the safety of its employees is a top priority.Rappley's family is still trying to process his death eight months after the robbery. Rappley's sister Jasmine Jessery said in an interview that she didn't hold a grudge toward Dukes. \"He was protecting himself,\" she said.  Jessery described her brother as a kind person who had linked up with the wrong crowd. \"Everything went sour\" then, she said. A thriving businessBusiness is booming at Dollar General, the chain adding more stores every year than any other retailer in America. That was the case even before the coronavirus pandemic, but Dollar General has been in an even stronger position during the pandemic as price-conscious consumers stock up on essential items.Dollar General has kept its stores open since the coronavirus hit, and its stock price has rallied 23% since the beginning of the year even as the S&P 500 has lost 5%. In March, the company announced a goal of hiring up to 50,000 new workers to meet increased customer demand. Former executives, store employees, law enforcement officials and retail security experts told CNN Business that while the company's low-cost, no-frills model might be embraced by Wall Street, it is putting its workers at risk. Dollar General stores, which process a high number of cash transactions, are a prime target for armed robberies, they said. Some of the former company officials and current and former employees spoke on the condition of anonymity either to discuss internal conversations or for fear that speaking out would impact their jobs. Dark side of a booming businessAt a time when other retailers are struggling, Dollar General is thriving. The company plans to add 1,000 stores in 2020.Meanwhile, insiders and security experts say the company is failing to protect workers from violent crime.In Dayton, Ohio, seven Dollar General stores accounted for 29% of commercial robberies in 2019. Police say they had repeatedly recommended stores improve security measures. At least six Dollar General employees have died during robberies since 2016, according to a review of news and police reports. \"Every night I was just waiting for there to be a phone call that said, 'Hey we've lost somebody,'\" Brian Flannery, who oversaw security at around 2,000 Dollar General stores in the northeast as a divisional loss prevention director from 2011 to 2015, said. \"It wasn't a matter there [of] if you were going to have a bad robbery. It was a matter of when.\"At least six Dollar General employees have died during robberies since 2016, according to a review of news and police reports. And while the FBI doesn't specifically track robberies at dollar stores as it does those which occur at convenience stores and gas stations \u2014 other robbery targets \u2014 police have warned company managers that its stores are vulnerable.   In a statement in response to this story, Dollar General said, \"We employ a number of measures designed to create and maintain a safe work environment for our employees and a safe shopping environment for our customers, all while protecting company assets.\"  The company said its safety and security measures take federal and state laws, retail industry standards and law enforcement recommendations into account and its measures are \"designed to prevent, deter and if necessary, respond to criminal activity in our stores.\" \"Our employees are our greatest asset. Their safety and security is of paramount importance,\" Dollar General added.The problem of robberies isn't exclusive to Dollar General. In an interview with CNN Business, Jason Hall, a lieutenant with the Dayton Police Department, described local dollar stores as \"robbery magnets.\"He has tracked robberies at local chains including Dollar Tree, Family Dollar and Dollar General over the last few years \u2014 and Dollar General, by far, had the most incidents.Lieutenant Jason Hall, photographed in March, says the Dayton Police Department repeatedly made security recommendations to dollar stores in the area but many of those recommendations were ignored.In Dayton alone, police were called to 86 robberies at just seven Dollar General stores between 2016 and 2019. Robberies at Dollar General locations accounted for 29% of the 80 commercial robberies in the city in 2019, according to figures provided by the department. Dollar General declined to comment on how much it spends annually on crime prevention or any specific measures in its stores to protect workers and prevent robberies \"as to do so potentially compromises the integrity of those measures, provides a roadmap to would-be wrongdoers and may place customers and employees at risk.\"Growing at a price As other retailers have struggled in recent years, dollar stores have enjoyed breakneck growth. The Great Recession, slow wage growth and widening inequality in America had all boosted discount retailers. Now the pandemic is as well. The two largest players are Dollar General and Dollar Tree, which bought Family Dollar in 2015. There are a few differences between the chains. At Dollar Tree, for example, all items are exactly $1. The stores tend to be in middle-class suburban areas. Dollar General's more than 16,000 stores, on the other hand, sell items largely in the $1 to $10 range, meaning there is more cash in registers. That makes stores more susceptible to robberies, according to retail security experts.  Dollar General stores are predominantly located in rural areas. About 75% of its stores are in towns with fewer than 20,000 people. Todd Vasos, the company's CEO, has described his core customers as struggling Americans. Dollar General's primary customers make $40,000 a year or below per household. \"We do very good in good times and we do fabulous in bad times,\" Vasos said on a call with Wall Street analysts in May. \"We're very, very bullish on what post-Covid looks like because...I think we're very well positioned no matter what this economy does to both our core customer and to the customer overall.\" We do very good in good times and we do fabulous in bad times.\"Todd Vasos, CEO, Dollar GeneralInvestors like Dollar General because it's been relentless at making more with less: less real estate, less labor and smaller product sizes than its larger big-box competitors. In its latest fiscal year, Walmart's US stores had a 5.1% operating profit margin before taxes; Dollar General stores boasted an 8.3% margin \u2014 an indicator that Dollar General is more efficient at keeping costs low and turning sales into profits.  Since 2010, Dollar General's annual profits have increased five-fold and its stock has surged more than 800%. Its locations have nearly doubled, and now the chain boasts more US stores than Walmart, Kroger, Costco and Home Depot combined. A record 25,000 retail stores are expected to close this year, but Dollar General still plans to open 1,000 new locations in 2020, or roughly 20 new stores a week.      But the company's low-cost approach often comes at the expense of employees, former executives said. Efforts to keep costs down have also kept the company's leadership from wanting to take bigger steps on security, these executives said.Visibility inside the stores is often poor for workers because of the design, according to law enforcement officials. Stores tend to be small and crowded, with high shelves and piles of boxes and carts lining the aisles. Some police patrolling outside complain that it's difficult to see inside because windows are covered with advertisements and signs.  Dollar General said in an email that \"we continually review and, as needed, adapt operating procedures and store layout [and] fixturing.\" Staffing is intentionally kept at a minimum, often with just one or two low-wage employees on site at any given time, former executives said. And although store registers are often flush with cash because it's what many customers use to pay, security guards are rarely on the premises. The Dayton Police Department says in 2017 it recommended Dollar General keep its windows clear as a security precaution. This store on Dayton's Salem Avenue, which was the site of four robberies between 2018 and 2020, had its windows covered as of March 2020.Security guards were viewed as costly to the company's bottom line, the former executives also said.  One former Dollar General executive described the difficulty in convincing other company leaders that security guards could deliver a positive return on investment. \"We certainly didn't get a return having somebody standing there and paying $10 or $12 an hour,\" the former executive said. \"Out of the 13,000 stores when I was there, probably less than 100 stores had some type of outside security.\"  Another of the former Dollar General executives, who focused on security, said he was \"heavily chastised\" for frequently going over budget on monthly guard expenses. Adding staff to stores would have also jeopardized the low-cost model. \"It's a low margin business, so you have to have low labor [costs] to make a profit,\" said one of the former executives. \"Putting more labor in the stores took away from the profit, or you have to raise prices. And there was no appetite to raise prices because it's a low-price business.\"  The company has invested in interactive security monitoring services. At thousands of stores in higher-crime neighborhoods or that have experienced frequent incidents, cameras are monitored by offsite security agents. The agents can communicate with employees in the store and make public announcements over the loudspeakers letting customers know they are on camera. If the agents see a robbery or suspicious activity at the store, they can alert the local police. There are also two-way phones and panic buttons that employees can press to talk directly with a security agent if they are in distress. Interface Security Systems, one of the services that Dollar General uses, boasts on its website that its technology helps companies reduce security guard costs by 88%. Dollar General also has used iVerify, another off-site monitoring company. Earlier this year, Securitas Electronic Security acquired the customer contracts of iVerify. This Dollar General store on N Gettysburg Ave in Dayton is where Dave Dukes said he experienced four robberies in just a year on the job.The remote monitoring systems can be effective at deterring shoplifting inside the store, according to experts. But unlike human security guards who can act as a visible, physical deterrent, they are less effective at deterring robberies, according to police, former employees at iVerify and Interface, and retail security consultants. One former iVerify executive said, \"it's rare that you're going to be looking at a video when the robbery occurs.\" He said the remote monitoring was better-suited for investigating robberies after they occurred.  Securitas, the company that now owns iVerify's customer contracts, did not respond to request for comment. A representative for Interface said \"there is a place for both remote interactive monitoring and security guards in most retail chains\" and that its interactive remote monitoring systems with live video and two-way audio were a strong crime deterrent. When robberies do occur, some of the former Dollar General executives said, the company offered reactive, short-term measures \u2014 such as adding a security guard to a store for a few weeks.  \"It was literally whack-a-mole. You would get the okay to spend cash when there was an incident. A reactive security program in that kind of environment is not what you're looking for,\" said Flannery, the former divisional loss prevention director at Dollar General.  Dollar General said it disagreed with Flannery's characterization of its security efforts and that it doesn't believe \"those assertions are supported by facts.\" The safety concerns take a toll on some workers.When Kenya Slaughter works the cash register at a Dollar General in Alexandria, Louisiana, she makes sure she has enough $1 and $10 bills in the drawer, so she won't have to go back into the safe. When she has to take out money from the safe behind the register, she \"strategically positions herself\" so she's not opening it with her back turned. Still, potential robbers \"know we don't have security and that people are in there alone,\" she said. Indeed, Dollar General employees told NBC News in a report last month that they've been stabbed, shot and held at gunpoint.  Significant 'shrink'In recent years, Dollar General has focused on solving another problem. Current and former staffers said there was an intense urgency to combat \"shrink\" \u2014 or merchandise lost due to shoplifting, employee theft or inventory errors. In its latest annual report filed in March, Dollar General called the problem \"significant,\" noting that \"higher rates of inventory shrinkage or increased security or other costs to combat inventory theft could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\" The sources said they felt that the company prioritized reducing \"shrink\" over preventing robberies, which had a human toll. \"In the two years I sat in the executive meetings, I never remember anybody bringing up armed robberies as a problem. We talked about loss of product and store manager turnover,\" said one former top Dollar General executive. \"The people that are below the store manager level are just a commodity.\"  The obsession with reducing shrink was often turned inward, with Dollar General treating some of its own workers with constant suspicion, said Tracy Vargas, an assistant professor of sociology and criminal justice at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. Vargas worked as a clerk at Dollar General in 2014 and 2015 for her PhD dissertation on dollar stores at Syracuse University. She also interviewed 50 employees from across the country. In her dissertation, she described workers being treated like criminals with surveillance cameras often focused on their activities rather than on customers.  The people that are below the store manager level are just a commodity.\"A former Dollar General executiveDollar General said its \"understanding is that Ms. Vargas's employment with the company was intended solely to validate her preconceived notions regarding the company for purposes of a book that she was writing, rather than in furtherance of serving the customers and communities that rely on us.\" It added: \"We categorically deny the assertions.\" A 13-foot poster in the store backroom, known as the Shrink Chart, displayed performance statistics including the number of times each employee voided cash register transactions that week, Vargas said. (A large number of voided transactions or price checks could be interpreted by managers as a sign of employee theft.)  Meanwhile, Dollar General provides little training on how to handle robberies, sources told CNN Business. Former store workers, including Dukes and Vargas, described when they were first hired being shown a simulation video of a robbery. There are no hands-on drills and they did not have to review the video annually, some of these sources said. In some stores, signs are posted in back rooms giving employees directions on what to do \"should the unlikely event of robbery occur.\"  Vargas told CNN Business that Dollar General employees are \"sitting ducks\" and \"considered to be profit risks to the corporation's bottom line.\"  \"Employees are alone, exposed, and at the mercy of whomever [decides] to walk through the door that day,\" she said.Law enforcement raises concerns In some cities, local officials have urged Dollar General management to take more steps to prevent violent crime. They say their warnings have largely gone ignored.Dayton police have prepared reports on crime at local Dollar General, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores. On February 1, 2017, members of the department presented a Dollar General divisional loss prevention director with a 32-slide PowerPoint deck detailing the factors the department believes to be \"enabling factors\" in robberies. The factors included blocked windows, high shelves, lack of maintenance outside the stores and lack of security guards in high-incident locations.  DOLLAR-STORE-CPTED (PDF)DOLLAR-STORE-CPTED (Text)It's a \"fairly large issue for us,\" Hall, the Dayton Police Department lieutenant, told CNN Business. \"We've made a lot of recommendations to try to improve these situations. We have noticed that not many of these recommendations have been implemented or fully implemented.\" Dollar General said it \"enjoys frequent communication with the Dayton Police Department\" and that it implemented the department's exterior maintenance suggestions in 2017. The company claimed the department did not provide \"specific store safety and security measures.\"A representative for Dollar Tree, which owns Family Dollar, said \"working with and supporting local law enforcement is absolutely important to us. We continually refine our security program, which includes cooperating with local police departments to share photos and videos to support their investigations.\"In St. Louis, where there have been \"high calls for police service for larcenies, disturbances [and] hold-ups\" at Dollar General and Family Dollar in recent years, \"implementing security is often suggested and ignored,\" said Rich Sykora, an attorney for the city of St. Louis. Lt. Hall described robberies at local dollar stores as a \"fairly large issue\" in the area. Seven Dollar General locations accounted for 29% of robberies at Dayton businesses in 2019, according to the department's data.\"We will take a fresh look at the St. Louis market and implement the appropriate steps,\" a Dollar Tree representative responded.In rural Effingham County, Georgia, Sheriff Jimmy McDuffie said three of the five Dollar General stores in the area have been hit in recent years. \"We don't call them dollar stores. We call them stop and robs,\" he said.  McDuffie presented a list of safety concerns to Dollar General stores in the county, he said, including recommendations to improve lighting and limit the number of boxes piled up inside the stores, which can make it difficult for officers to see inside. \"Put in some security measures,\" he urged. \"Light the parking lots up.\"  \"They say they're going to do better, but it doesn't seem to come to fruition,\" he told CNN Business.  And in the Pee Dee region of South Carolina, there have been a string of robberies at Dollar General stores over the past year. \"None of the stores have added outside cameras that could potentially capture the mode of transportation and the direction of travel for suspects,\" said Tammy Erwin, a deputy at the Marion County Sheriff's Office in South Carolina.\"There are no security officers at any time. There are shifts with only one employee working in the entire store,\" she said. She added that she wonders why Dollar General won't implement \"a buddy-system of employees, so that no one is alone in the store.\"  We don't call them dollar stores. We call them stop and robs.\"Jimmy McDuffie, Sheriff, Effingham County, GeorgiaDollar General's 2019 handbook of operating procedures says \"at a minimum, two employees must be involved in the closing process. For safety purposes, always use the buddy system.\" But there is no mention of similar policy for opening stores in the morning or at other hours of the day. The company says it \"tries to minimize the time that employees are alone in the store.\" The company said it has received \"no formal safety and security policy change\" from the sheriff's offices in Effingham County, Georgia, and Marion County, South Carolina. Dollar General said it was \"aware of a single request from a member of law enforcement in St. Louis,\" who requested that Dollar General implement facial recognition software from a company \"in which we understood the individual to have a personal and financial interest.\"   Deaths on the jobFamily members of Dollar General employees killed during armed robberies and security experts say it's not just a lack of in-store security measures that are the problem.  Out of the six Dollar General employees killed since 2016, two were shot as they left stores to deposit cash from the register at the bank.  Some Dollar General employees take cash deposits to the bank by themselves: The company's policy in its 2019 store operating procedures says that stores should make one or two such deposits each day depending on their location, and that the deposits can only be made by \"key carriers,\" or high-ranking employees.  Ron Holder took a job as a store manager at a Dollar General in Richmond, Virginia, and hoped to work his way up the ranks at the company and become a district manager. But he was killed in his car outside of Dollar General one morning after picking up a cash deposit from the store, according to the FBI. His case is still unsolved.  Ron Holder (left) and DeQuan Anderson (right) were Dollar General employees who were both killed on the job during armed robberies. (Courtesy Angela/Courtesy Janine Anderson)In Houston, 20-year-old DeQuan Anderson was killed in 2017 as he got in his car to bring cash from the store to the bank. His mother, Janine, has filed a wrongful death lawsuit. The case has gone to arbitration. Janine Anderson described her son in an interview as \"an all-around good kid\" who was active in his church and developed a love of photography in high school. He saved up money to buy a camera and equipment and took it everywhere he went.    \"He always was going to have some type of career in art,\" she said. \"That was his passion.\" Before his death, DeQuan had raised concerns about the bank-drop process on multiple occasions, the lawsuit said. But despite previous robberies at the store, Dollar General did not increase its security or hire an outside security company to transport cash to the bank, the lawsuit alleges.   Dollar General declined to comment on pending litigation.  Meanwhile, Dukes, the former Dollar General employee in Dayton, Ohio, is trying to bounce back after the October robbery that changed his life. He has had trouble finding work after the shooting. He is hoping to be more present in his kids' lives. \"I don't regret anything that I did,\" he said. He was defending himself, he said.But Dukes believes the robbery could have been avoided if Dollar General had taken his advice and put in permanent armed security. He hopes company executives will start doing more to protect their employees. \"They don't know what's going on inside these stores every day. They don't. Store managers are the ones that deal with that every day. But I would tell them that they need to take better care of their staff.\" Dukes said he repeatedly asked Dollar General to hire security guards, but managers dismissed his requests. He hopes the company will do more to protect its workers.Additional camera: Craig Waxman, Jeremy HarlanVideo graphics: John GeneralSupervising producer: Bronte LordPhoto editors: Marie Barbier, Brett RoegiersVisual editor: Tal YellinStory editors: Alex Koppelman, Annalyn Kurtz, Anjali Robins",

        "content": "Amid the protests over the death of George Floyd and larger racial inequalities in the US last week, Refinery29 swapped the colors of its website, going from its usual jewel-tone to the Black Lives Matter movement's signature black. It was supposed to be a show of solidarity and of unity between a progressive website aimed at women and the movement.  Instead it inspired a revolt.  In the ensuing days, a number of former employees came forward on Twitter to call out what they saw as hypocrisy on the part of the website's leadership, especially when it came to matters of race and diversity. The site's co-founder and editor-in-chief, Christene Barberich, had repeatedly confused one black woman with another, one said; another tweeted that an executive once confused her with the caterer; a third person said she was paid $15,000 less than her two white coworkers who were doing the same job. And within less than a week, Barberich was out of her job, saying on Monday she was stepping down \"to help diversify our leadership in editorial.\" Ashley C. Ford, the former employee who said Barberich used to confuse her for another black woman, was one of the most prominent people who spoke out, saying in one tweet that she'd left Refinery29 after nine months because of a \"toxic company culture where white women's egos ruled.\" She was moved to tweet, she told CNN Business afterward, by seeing a thread from another former employee, Ashley Alese Edwards. \"[W]hen I started reading that thread and started seeing some of the responses to it, the big thing that hit me was, 'Oh, you idiot. Leaving didn't make anything stop. ... You left and they kept doing this. They kept treating women like this. They kept treating black women like this,'\" she said.  Read MoreJournalists of color are fed up and speaking outFord and Edwards were not the only ones who spoke out, or the only ones with disturbing stories to tell. Some sources who spoke to CNN Business said there was a glaring lack of diversity at the company. Some said that despite the inclusive image that the site tried to present, Barberich made a number of editorial decisions that had the effect of diminishing minority and especially black women.  When Barberich was approving photos for the site, a former editor and a former executive photography director told CNN Business, she would reject some as \"off-brand.\" The pictures she rejected that way were consistently of women who were either black or plus-size, they said. These two former employees said they knew the types of celebrities that Barberich would approve to be included in Refinery's coverage, and that her decisions appeared to be based on race.  \"If I wasn't at my desk looking like I was producing, I had to have a damn good excuse. It was terrifying.\"  Kristin Booker, a contract writer at Refinery29 in 2014Barberich \"loved Solange Knowles, Janelle Mon\u00e1e was OK, but otherwise our team knew which celebrities would get rejected... the black ones,\" the former editor said. \"We kept pitching them anyway. But it was a running and grim, unfunny joke on our team. We'd say, 'Gee, I wonder who will possibly get cut?' Because we knew.\" In response to this accusation, Barberich said in a statement, \"My goal has always been to help close the representation gap and I believe that is reflected across the pages of Refinery29.\" The former executive photography director said she repeatedly filed human resources complaints against Barberich for her editorial choices but was told by an HR representative that it was not the company's job to manage Barberich, who reported to global president and chief content officer Amy Emmerich. Statement from Nancy Dubuc, CEO, VICE Media Group\"We are deeply dismayed to learn of the toxic culture that has existed at Refinery29, issues we were not made aware of when we acquired the company in November 2019 and for which the founders have apologized and taken accountability. It is unacceptable, and we are grateful to all the people who bravely came forward to shed light on the situation. We have announced a search for a new Editor-In-Chief of Refinery29 and an immediate action plan to ensure that our workplace empowers diversity, equity, and inclusion inside our walls and reflects the brand purpose audiences have come to know us for.\"Statement from Christine Barberich, former editor-in-chief of Refinery29 \"I co-founded Refinery29 to do something different: I wanted to amplify and build community around women rarely seen or heard in media, including media directed at women themselves. I know now that we fell short in cultivating that same mission and building that same safe space within Refinery29, to the detriment of Black women and women of color in particular. Leadership at Refinery29 owns that, and I own that. I realize that, over the past fifteen years, these women have given Refinery29 its voice, its purpose, its defining vision. I couldn't see how my own perspectives and privileges held back the changes that needed to be made to further that purpose and vision, and to provide these women with the support they needed. That was a failure on my part. To all those I let down, especially members of my own team: I'm deeply sorry. The reason I stepped aside this week was to acknowledge that failing, and to make space for a new editor-in chief and a new generation of leadership at Refinery29 who can forge a path with an even deeper commitment to our original mission.\"Nancy Dubuc, the CEO of Vice Media Group, which owns Refinery29, said in a statement to CNN Business on Thursday, that Vice was unaware of the \"toxic culture\" at Refinery29 when it acquired the company. \"It is unacceptable, and we are grateful to all the people who bravely came forward to shed light on the situation,\" she said. Dubuc added that Vice is looking for a new editor-In-chief for the site and has put in place an \"immediate action plan to ensure that our workplace empowers diversity, equity, and inclusion inside our walls and reflects the brand purpose audiences have come to know us for.\"In a lengthy statement responding to CNN Business' questions about her alleged actions, Barberich said she had co-founded Refinery29 to \"amplify and build community around women rarely seen or heard in media.\" She acknowledged a personal failure to do that, \"to the detriment of Black women and women of color in particular,\" saying, \"I couldn't see how my own perspectives and privileges held back the changes that needed to be made to further that purpose and vision, and to provide these women with the support they needed.\" She continued, \"To all those I let down, especially members of my own team: I'm deeply sorry. The reason I stepped aside this week was to acknowledge that failing, and to make space for a new editor-in chief and a new generation of leadership at Refinery29 who can forge a path with an even deeper commitment to our original mission.\"  When Vice Media announced last year that it was acquiring Refinery29, Dubuc sent a memo to staffers in which she acknowledged the seemingly mismatched company cultures. Vice is the notoriously edgy hipster outfit that was the subject of a 2017 New York Times article exposing toxicity and sexual harassment scandals inside the company, while Refinery29 is a fashion site aimed at progressive women and promoting diversity and inclusion. \"[H]ow can the 'bros' ever mesh with the feminists of Refinery?\" she asked.  But 60 current and former Refinery29 employees who spoke with CNN Business over the course of a lengthy investigation painted a picture of a culture that actually fit quite well. The issues at Refinery29 were not limited to ones around race, they said. Refinery29's official mission is for women to \"claim their power,\" but the video team was led by a male manager who, three former female staffers allege, verbally abused them in public. Refinery29 promotes stories about self-care, but 23 employees said overly ambitious traffic demands made them feel chained to their desks, and others said it kept them from taking vacations. Refinery29 tells women to ask for more money, even publishing a book that dealt in part with the subject, but 27 staffers said they were underpaid or restricted from raises.\u202f\u202f \"When people talk about the cultures not meshing it's astonishing to me because\u202ffrom\u202fwhat I can tell the cultures are very similar,\" a former editor said. \"[A] culture that's about corporate excess and workers being treated terribly, that's Refinery.\"\u202f\u202f Unbothered Refinery29 had started as a fashion and beauty blog. But over time it evolved into a site that included coverage of women's issues, pay gaps, and sexual harassment, among other topics. In 2016, it launched The 67% Project, a campaign to promote female representation of \"all shapes and sizes\" by highlighting the population of women \"who are defined as plus size.\" Money Diaries, a reader-generated column, challenged women to speak more openly about salaries and money management.\u202f\u202f\u202f Refinery29 office in New York City. (Courtesy of Chad McPhail)\nMany of the sources who spoke to CNN Business about their experiences at Refinery29 said they had joined the company enthusiastic about being part of a brand dedicated to women's empowerment. But once inside they were shocked by a workplace that seemed at odds with its public image. \"Walking around that office when I worked there, it was very white, very straight,\" a former producer said. \"That always bugged me. It's not what I expected. It's not that they didn't believe in the message, but the talent needs to reflect the content they are producing.\" Nikki Tucker, a former social media editor, said, \"Refinery was really touted as that millennial place of inclusivity, where women are celebrated. You're not shamed for your body. It felt right up my alley. As a black woman in America, there aren't really too many spaces for me to be at a place where inclusivity is celebrated \u2014 at least, so I thought.\" Kristin Booker, a writer on contract at Refinery29 in 2014, recalled that she was one of only a few black people in the office when she worked there.  Ford worked at Refinery29 in 2017. She \"would spend a lot of time in office late,\" she said, and the people who were \"most likely there, still working ... were black women.\"  \"When I talked to those women about how much money they were making and what their expectations were and what their relationship was like with their superiors, it became very clear to me that I was being treated differently and I didn't want no part of that,\" Ford said.  Chart of Refinery29's diversity in 2018, obtained by CNN BusinessIn 2018, Refinery29's staff was 69% white and 8% black, according an internal diversity survey obtained by CNN Business. According to updated numbers provided by Vice, Refinery29's staff as of June 9, 2020 was 54.42% white and 10.7% black. These numbers are comparable to at least some of Refinery29's competitors', according to publicly released data. In 2019 BuzzFeed US' staff was 7.7% black and Vox Media was 8% black.Among those who spoke out publicly about Refinery29 last week were founding members of Unbothered, a sub-brand for black women. Current and former staffers who spoke with CNN Business frequently cited Unbothered, along with other similarly progressive, inclusive work like The 67% Project and The Anti-Diet Project as among the editorial projects they were most proud of and that were most celebrated internally. But getting Unbothered off the ground was a struggle, according to its founders.  \"Creating Unbothered was a year-long journey that led to the strongest community of Black women I had ever seen at the company,\" former senior social media editor Alessandra Hickson said in a statement to CNN Business that she then posted on Instagram over the weekend. \"But it was also, unfortunately, one of the hardest years of my life thanks to a toxic culture that left me emotionally drained.\" Hickson wrote that she \"observed other colleagues, usually Black and Brown women, be subjected to tone policing, pay disparity, and open verbal abuse.\"\u202f Sesali Bowen, a former senior entertainment writer and a founding member of Unbothered, also spoke out online and in an email to CNN Business. \"I thought it was a privilege to be getting exposure and experience across different areas of the company. I thought I was uniquely valued,\" Bowen wrote in the email. \"In hindsight, I believe I was being tokenized as a fat Black woman and underpaid for my work.\"  Bowen said Barberich once \"ran her fingers through my hair\" as she complimented her new hairstyle.\u202f CNN Business corroborated this account with an eyewitness who said the incident happened out in the open where others could see.  In her statement on Thursday, Barberich apologized for this, saying \"I am truly sorry if this happened and if she felt uncomfortable in any way.\"  She also apologized for confusing Ford with another woman: \"I could have certainly called her the wrong name. If I did, I sincerely apologize,\" she said. Publicly, Refinery29 touts the success of Unbothered, but several of its founding members told CNN Business that the company initially had been resistant to the idea. Former producer Ryen Williams, who was laid off in 2018, recalled frequent meetings she had with Amy Emmerich, Refinery29's chief content officer, about the need for more content created by people of color. Eventually, Emmerich helped the founders settle on an Instagram profile separate from Refinery29's main account that became Unbothered, which has since grown to a full vertical with a newsletter and a tab on the site. \"In addition to being segregated, we were told that we wouldn't be given resources to create,\" Williams told CNN Business. \"After it took off ... the company realized that Unbothered could be monetized and that's when they started to care.\" On Thursday, Emmerich issued a statement about the launch of Unbothered, saying, \"When we start new franchises we start small, with a soft launch, and ask ourselves 'what would resonate with the audience?' [Hickson] was instrumental and the only full time staff with one freelancer. However we used shared services from across the company -- from photo, design and video. In 2018 [Hickson] left -- and since then Unbothered has grown to 4 dedicated staff and 1 freelancer.\" Refinery29 office in New York City. (Courtesy of Chad McPhail)\nRaven Baker, a former associate social media editor for Unbothered, said she left the company due to burnout. She had repeatedly brought up to management concerns about low morale and team issues, she said, to which the company responded by changing staffers' seat assignments. \"Unbothered is supposed to be a safe space for black women on the internet. How is that when it's not even a safe space in the workplace?\" Baker said.  Unbothered continues to lack support at Refinery29. Several former and current staffers told CNN Business that the Instagram account is primarily run by an intern making $15 per hour.\u202f  Emmerich sent a memo to staff on Thursday, apologizing \"to the many Black women and POC who have spoken out about the unacceptable culture at Refinery29 with courageous, raw and painful stories about their experiences. No qualifications, no excuses -- I am sorry.\" She acknowledged that she \"let our audience down\" and vowed to be \"more present\" going forward. Even after the launch of Unbothered, Barberich repeatedly made other editorial decisions that placed non-white women in the background of the site's coverage, or excluded them altogether.  In addition to the comments sources said she made about photos of women who were not thin and not white being \"off-brand\" and the list of acceptable celebrities sources said she kept that included only black celebrities who are light-skinned, one former editor who spoke to CNN Business said they had witnessed several instances in which Barberich picked photos of white people over ones that included people of color because she said \"white faces\" drove more traffic.   Another former editor and a former producer said they witnessed similar editorial decisions by Barberich. Barberich allegedly made some of these decisions based on A/B testing \u2014 a method used to compare two variations of the same content online to see which performs better with readers. \"White faces always got more clicks than brown or tan faces, which is the audience's doing, not the company's, yet the data always had the final say,\" the former editor said.\u202f\u202f The producer concurred, saying, \"Most employees pushed very hard for diversity on the site.\" \"The pace there was untenable\"Before it became a digital media empire, Refinery29 started in 2005 as a niche fashion blog about independent shops in New York City. Its four cofounders -- Justin Stefano, Philippe von Borries, Piera Gelardi, and Barberich -- led it together until Stefano and von Borries, who bore the titles of co-CEOs, stepped away from day-to-day roles after the Vice acquisition.   Refinery29 founders Justin Stefano, Christene Barberich, Piera Gelardi, and Philippe von Borries speak onstage during a 2018 event in New York City.  Stefano and von Borries on Wednesday addressed the allegations in a post on the Refinery29 website, saying, \"Even though we're no longer at the company, as co-founders and former Co-CEOs, at the end of the day the buck \u2014 and the culture \u2014 stopped with us.\"   \"After having read these accounts, we recognize how our privilege as two white male CEOs created blinders that kept us from seeing the struggles, exclusion, and aggressions that you felt at R29. This is an earthquake of a wake-up call,\" they said. \"We wanted to create an inclusive environment but didn't spend enough time with team members listening to them and hearing their stories.\" The company evolved into a \"rare haven for young women to be taken seriously,\" said one former staffer. Women, many in their twenties, wrote about fashion and beauty in their own voices and attended some of the industry's most high-profile events.  \"The brand really, truly, was on fire,\" said Annie Tomlin, a former beauty director. \"I have so many emails from people wanting to get a byline or photo credit there. Brands and publicists were deeply interested in being my friend because I worked there. It was the cool place to be.\"\u202f \u202f\u202f But Tomlin, who started at Refinery29 in 2012, said that on her first day she left the office \"in tears\" when she learned\u202fthe reality of the company's ambitious traffic goals. She had 12 years of experience in media and saw herself as a \"very quick learner\" but, she said, \"the pace there was untenable.\" \"I felt like I was thrown into the deep end,\" Tomlin told CNN Business.\u202f \"Even if you were doing everything you could, there were some factors that are beyond your control.\" Ten staffers who spoke to CNN Business said management's relentless push for traffic was apparent in a constant stream of emails sent to the editorial teams to communicate how they were pacing relative to their goals. A former Refinery29 editor described the emails as \"quite impressive and thorough\" but added that \"every time I saw that email arrive, my stomach would tighten because it could mean we suddenly had to scramble to make up for lost pageviews.\"\u202f It's not unusual for publications to push for traffic. Advertising revenue depends on bringing readers to a site; hitting traffic goals can be the difference between a publication's thriving or dying.  But former Refinery29 staffers said they found themselves overworked by what they say were the company's overly ambitious traffic goals.\u202f Some of the staffers who spoke to CNN Business said they saw traffic as a reflection of their own popularity. Three former writers said they would get reports that showed who was behind in hitting their traffic goals.\u202f\u202f\u202f \"Screenshots of articles were put up during meetings, and names weren't cropped out, so you felt the failure personally,\" a former writer said. \"It sucked.\"\u202f Booker, the writer who was on contract at Refinery29 in 2014, nicknamed it the \"shame board.\"\u202f One way that many sites keep a strong output of content to drive traffic is by picking up original reporting from other news outlets and rewriting it \u2014 known in the industry as aggregation. Another way is by monitoring trending stories from social media to see where readers' interests are at any given moment. These stories are often easy to produce, requiring little or no reporting and yet driving a significant number of readers to a site.\u202f\u202f But Refinery29 wanted it both ways: they wanted the fast trending stories, but done as if they were another, more labor-intensive, kind of article. A former editor who spoke to CNN Business said their team of three reporters was asked to produce 12 to 15 stories total per day. Each of these stories was supposed to include multiple interviews, plus original photography or illustrations. That workload would be daunting even for a seasoned newspaper beat reporter, who, on a typical day, might produce just one or two stories.\u202f\u202f  The desire on the part of Refinery29 to create beautifully packaged stories with original reporting was admirable, but at least six former employees told CNN Business that the pressure from all of it led to burnout. Booker said she typically wrote six to seven stories a day.\u202f \"I wasn't used to the feeling of if I left my desk for longer than a few minutes, somebody was going to come looking for me,\" Booker said. \"If I wasn't at my desk looking like I was producing, I had to have a damn good excuse. It was terrifying.\"  Similarly, some staffers on the video team said they were under what they considered \"aggressive\" mandates for video views. Some producers would play Refinery29 videos on a loop at their desks to increase views, according to two former staffers on the video team.\u202f In the pursuit of traffic, Refinery29 went from unearthing unique stories about fashion to chasing trending stories and celebrity news.\u202f\u202f \"I used to describe Refinery29 as Vogue in the modern era. After 2016, especially the last couple of years, it became more about selling so our content watered down...to a younger teen magazine,\" said a former Refinery29 designer.\u202f\u202f\u202f Jess Rezendes, a supervising story producer, told CNN Business that the day she \"realized that Refinery29 was full of sh*t\" was when co-founder Gelardi sent an email to encourage staffers to write and generate traffic as a way to support \"A Day Without A Woman,\" a strike that took place in March 2017 to protest President Trump's policies. Other female-centric sites, including Bustle and Teen Vogue, went dark for the occasion. New York Magazine's culture site The Cut also went on strike to support the cause. Gelardi did not ban staffers from participating in the strike, but Refinery29 kept publishing stories that day. For Rezendes, the email was disingenuous and showed what she called Refinery29's \"hypocrisy\" because she felt that it was self-serving for the company to be producing content rather than striking. Refinery29 offered unlimited vacation as a perk, but some writers say the push for traffic made taking time off nearly impossible. According to five former writers, editorial staffers had to prep a minimum of one story for every vacation day they took, something not typically required of journalists in other newsrooms. At least two people said that this policy prevented them from taking time off.\u202f\u202f The hope was that writers could complete the extra work between the business hours of 9:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m., according to an internal email obtained by CNN Business. But that was not always possible, according to the five former staffers.\u202f\u202f One former writer said after taking one sick day due to an infection, her manager asked her to \"double\" her output -- meaning at least four stories -- when she returned the next day.\u202f\u202f\u202f Toxic managers Barberich wasn't the only manager at Refinery29 who current and former employees accused of toxic behavior in interviews with CNN Business. There is also Stone Roberts, who was hired from Scripps in 2014 to help Refinery29 increase its video output. In a 2018 interview with Forbes, Emmerich, the chief content officer, cited Roberts as a \"great partner\" who \"helped pave the road so when I got here at Refinery29, I could run.\" Refinery29 hired Emmerich in January 2015, also from Scripps, to help build out the site's video production. Stone Roberts (L) and  Amy EmmerichDespite this high praise for Roberts, staffers on the video team said they felt demoralized by him. Three former staffers said he yelled at and insulted them in meetings when other employees were around. Two of those former staffers who were subjected to this abuse said he was \"vindictive\" when called out on it. One of those staffers said he lost his temper and cursed at them. This person said Roberts later apologized by placing a bottle of hard alcohol on her desk and muttering \"sorry\" as he walked away. \"To me, it wasn't an environment that's actually fostering female empowerment. It was fostering insecurity,\" the staffer said.\u202f\u202f Roberts told CNN Business in a statement through Vice that he had \"received extensive management training and coaching between 2015-2016 to address these issues.\" But at a routine video team meeting in 2017, three witnesses said Roberts lashed out at the video team over an anonymous employee satisfaction survey about Refinery29's workplace culture. Some staffers who took the survey told CNN Business that they cited his behavior as a reason for their job dissatisfaction. In a packed conference in the New York office, Roberts \"sits there and just tears into the entire team. 'You guys destroyed me. How could you do this to me?'\" a former staffer in attendance told CNN Business.\u202f\u202f\u202f \"To me, it wasn't an environment that's actually fostering female empowerment. It was fostering insecurity.\"former employee on the video teamA second former staffer who was at the meeting said, \"We were all in there and he was clearly really upset and he addressed it and it was a weird vibe because it sucks to hear these things about yourself, but at the same time, how is this surprising?\"\u202f  In August 2017, Roberts moved to Los Angeles to \"build out the video team,\" according to reports. That's the \"story we were all told,\" a former staffer said. What's not clear is whether Roberts was reprimanded or punished for language his co-workers found offensive. He is now the Senior Vice President and Head of Global Production & Operations at Vice Studios Roberts said in his statement that he moved to Los Angeles \"for family reasons.\" Money disparities \u202f\u202fRefinery29 has covered the gender wage gap and offered strategies for women to ask for raises. In fact, Refinery29 produced an editorial package, \"The Secret Guide to Getting More,\" in December 2017 as a how-to guide on salary negotiations. It was billed as a \"first step toward asking for what you deserve.\" But when nearly a dozen employees did exactly that, they said, they felt they were shut down. \u202f One former writer told CNN Business that around the same time the guide was published, she was given a promotion, but it was only in title.\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f \"Here you are telling readers they should ask for more, but you're giving me a promotion that is title-only,\" the former writer said. \"The messaging we were constantly given is we're family. We'll take care of you. We're a family. But that's not the way you treat your family.\" Refinery29 office in New York City. (Courtesy of Chad McPhail)\nA former designer at the company said she was rebuffed when she took her pay disparity complaint to human resources after she learned that a male colleague in a similar role made more than she did. Another former writer said their manager offered a raise, only to revoke it later without providing a reason. A former editor said she tried and failed to secure a raise for a writer to match the salary of another writer with similar experience who was making $14,000 more. A former female employee said she had to threaten legal action in order to secure a raise to match what a male colleague in the same role was making. \"At the top level when I tried to fight this, they were all women, and no one really paid any attention to it. How is this possible here?\" the former designer said.\u202f Megan McIntyre, a former beauty director, said she discovered she had been making at least $30,000 less than her friends in similar positions at other publications. When she asked for a larger raise than the $5,000 bump from a promotion, she was turned down.\u202f\u202f\u202f \"The response at the time was along the lines of we can't give you this kind of raise because then we'd have to let other people go,\" McIntyre said. \"That's the thing where they spent too much money and now they can't afford to pay you what you're worth.\"\u202f\u202f Refinery29's biggest cash infusion came in August 2016 through a $45 million funding round led by Turner, a relationship that meant Refinery29 could expand its video footprint. (CNN was a division of Turner, an entity that now operates under the umbrella of AT&T's WarnerMedia, which owns CNN.) Refinery29 held a champagne toast to celebrate.\u202f \"That meeting felt like nothing could stop us, that our content was going to be on TV and Refinery29 was going towards world domination,\" said a former Refinery29 designer.\u202f\u202f\u202f In December 2017, Refinery29 laid off 34 employees, about 7.5% of its workforce, and the company shifted to focus on \"growth engines,\" including long-form scripted and unscripted video.\u202f\u202f\u202f After those layoffs, Refinery29 employees began talking about unionizing to address the problems at the company.\u202f\u202fIn January 2019, a few months after Refinery29 laid off dozens more people, 40 members of the editorial staff unionized with the Writers Guild of America, East. In December, Refinery29 staffers agreed to be covered under Vice's union.   \"The messaging we were constantly given is we're family. We'll take care of you. We're a family. But that's not the way you treat your family.\" Former writer at Refinery29\"[Vice's] contract establishes salary minimums, which have been crucial in bringing those who were underpaid -- including most of our writers, editors, contractors and freelance writers -- up to industry standards,\" Leah Carroll, a member of Refinery29's labor management committee, said in a statement in May. \"We also were able to secure annual cost-of-living wage increases and standardized job descriptions across the unit.\"  Carroll was one of at least 10 Refinery29 staffers who was laid off in June when Vice Media cut 155 jobs due to the economic fallout of the pandemic.  For one former editor, her frustration over Refinery29's pay disparity stemmed from what she saw as the company's wasteful spending on the free snacks, kombucha on tap, happy hours and extravagant holiday parties she saw when she worked there. \u202f\u202f \"We'd hear how successful the company was, how we were profitable and bringing in revenue, and getting these massive advertising deals,\" the former editor said. \"It was hard to see and hear, like, 'There's all this money! But you can't have any.'\"",

        "content": "New York (CNN Business)A Facebook employee who quit the company this week told CNN he is worried the platform will be used to further escalate violence in the United States. Timothy Aveni, a 22-year-old Facebook software engineer, quit after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg refused to take action on President Donald Trump's warning last week that \"looting\" would lead to \"shooting,\" as protests gripped the United States. Aveni announced the move in a Facebook post that went viral. Zuckerberg's inaction, Aveni said, proved the 36-year-old billionaire had abandoned one of his key principles to shut down calls for violence on Facebook. \"Zuck has told us over and over that calls to violence would not be tolerated on the platform, even if they were by the President of the United States,\" Aveni told CNN Thursday from his home in Menlo Park, California, near Facebook's world headquarters. Aveni said he saw grim parallels between Facebook's decision to allow Trump's message on the platform and the manner in which Facebook was used to fuel violence against the Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim minority group in Myanmar. Facebook admitted in 2018 that it had failed to do enough to prevent its platform being used to fuel bloodshed in Myanmar.  Read MoreAlthough the company has implemented new policies and procedures since -- especially around misinformation, online hate, and incitement to violence -- some Facebook staff say they have been left wondering if some of the company's most significant commitments are hollow.  Zuckerberg had pledged that calls for violence would not be tolerated. \"If anyone, including a politician, is saying things that can cause, that is calling for violence or could risk imminent physical harm ... we will take that content down,\" he said testifying before Congress last October. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before Congress in October.As protests, some violent, played out across the US, President Trump posted on Facebook and Twitter last week, \"these THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won't let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\" His phrase \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" mirrors language used by a Miami police chief in the late 1960s in the wake of riots.  Aveni viewed Trump's post as a call for violence. Twitter took action on identical language posted on its platform saying Trump had glorified violence.  Zuckerberg decided to take no action, explaining in a Facebook post, \"we decided to leave it up because the National Guard references meant we read it as a warning about state action, and we think people need to know if the government is planning to deploy force.\" \"I don't think that this was a decision made based on principle,\" Aveni told CNN Thursday, \"I think he made the decision and then tried to find some way to connect it to principle, because that was convenient for him. And that's not the way these things should go.\" Decision to quit After interning at the company twice during college, Aveni started a full-time job at Facebook immediately after finishing college a year ago.  He was optimistic about the role he could play at Facebook, saying, \"I think Facebook in a lot of ways is a really positive force for good in the world. There are incredible ways that Facebook is able to connect people to other people, and we're seeing all over the world that that is having a really positive impact on people's lives.\" Facebook had, by the time he joined in 2019, faced scrutiny on a number of fronts. Aveni said he understood that. \"So I knew that Facebook wasn't pure,\" he said. \"And I acknowledged that, you know, to some extent, maybe I, I should accept blame for, for going there anyway. But I really do think that in many, many ways, Facebook is a net positive in the world, and I wanted to help contribute to the positive.\" Timothy Aveni quit his job at Facebook after CEO Mark Zuckerberg refused to take action on a post from President Trump.After revelations of widespread misinformation before the 2016 US presidential election, Facebook partnered with the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) to work with a global network of third-party fact-checkers.  While posts debunked by fact-checkers remain on Facebook, a fact-checking message is appended to them.  Facebook often points to the network of third-party fact-checkers when it attempts to push back on the perception that the company itself is an arbiter of truth. As an engineer, Aveni said he is part of a team that is responsible for showing fact-checks to Facebook users.It was only a few months into his time at the company though that Aveni, a registered Democrat, began feeling disturbed by what he viewed as the company reneging on its principles. In September, after protests from Republican US senators, Facebook removed a fact-check on an anti-abortion video.  Aveni saw Facebook's intervention in the fact-check of the anti-abortion video as highly problematic, evidence, he says, of Zuckerberg bowing to pressure from conservatives and an abandonment of principle. An investigation by the International Fact-Checking Network found the fact-check to be \"fair and accurate.\" But it was Facebook's inaction on Trump's posts last week was what ultimately led Aveni to quit. Others stay Aveni's public resignation, along with growing public outcry from current employees on social media, is essentially unprecedented in a company where dissent is usually kept in-house. Some employees, according to Aveni, have chosen to stay at the company in an attempt to use their positions to change it. Aveni described resigning as an \"extreme option.\" \"I think that the right option for a lot of people, including many of my colleagues, is to keep trying to do the right thing from within the company. I just felt like I couldn't do it anymore. I was exhausted.\" Aveni resigned from his job in a public post on Facebook.Despite his public Facebook post on Monday slamming Zuckerberg, when Aveni spoke to CNN Thursday he was still an employee of the company \u2014 having given Facebook two weeks' notice.  On Thursday night, a Facebook spokesperson told CNN that Aveni was no longer an employee. A fact that Aveni said had not been relayed to him when asked by CNN on Thursday night. Aveni said he still had access to systems including his work email.Aveni said he decided to go public with his resignation to show those who suffer racial injustice \"in this really chaotic time in the country that we are allies.\" Aveni said he has been overwhelmed by the outpouring of public support since his post on Monday. He's received messages about potential new work, and he confirmed, \"I have received outreach from some employees at Twitter.\" A Facebook spokesperson did not respond directly to Aveni but pointed to a statement the company had issued earlier in the week, \"We recognize the pain many of our people are feeling right now, especially our Black community. We encourage employees to speak openly when they disagree with leadership. As we face additional difficult decisions around content ahead, we'll continue seeking their honest feedback.\"The spokesperson also pointed to Zuckerberg's two public posts on the issue. Some optimism One group controversially exempt from the fact-checking system at Facebook is politicians, who can lie without having their posts or ads flagged with fact-checking messages or penalized by the algorithm under Facebook's current rules.  \"We don't fact-check political ads. We don't do this to help politicians, but because we think people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying,\" Zuckerberg said in a speech defending the policy last year, \"I know many people disagree, but, in general, I don't think it's right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy.\" Despite disagreeing with that exemption, Aveni said he think Facebook has done a good job fighting misinformation.  \"They've spun up a great misinformation team that's done really incredible work in making sure that misinformation doesn't have as big of an impact as it would have had otherwise,\" he said.  But, Aveni warns, it doesn't matter how good the technology is, or how good partnerships with the likes of fact-check organizations are if Zuckerberg and company leadership aren't going to step-up in the moments that matter.  \"I think [Zuckerberg is] scared to take action when it really, really matters,\" Aveni said, \"And that concerns me because I don't know how many chances we have to do the right thing anymore. I think we're seeing the country go down a really, really dangerous path.\"",

The significance of the moment was not lost on the team at Zoom. \"That was the big aha moment,\" Zoom board member Santi Subotovsky told CNN Business. Zoom founder Eric Yuan poses in front of the Nasdaq building after the company's IPO in April 2019. (Kena Betancur/Getty Images)Read MoreZoom grew into a vastly profitable business selling software to businesses that could enable a venture capital firm to seamlessly take virtual pitch meetings from around the globe or an executive to deliver an all-hands to a remote workforce. Powering British Cabinet meetings was never on the radar. \"Our company that used to be a 100% enterprise-focused, is now powering the world. It's powering governments, education, social activities... And then when the other shoe dropped, it's like we need to get ready for that,\" Subotovsky said. Zoom was already enmeshed in controversy. Less than two weeks earlier, The New York Times had raised the flag on \"Zoombombing,\" opening the door to a flood of scrutiny, from its feeding data into Facebook to the New York State Attorney General scrutinizing its data practices. But for Eric Yuan, the 50-year-old founder and CEO of Zoom, it was the Johnson tweet that changed everything.This morning I chaired the first ever digital Cabinet. Our message to the public is: stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives. #StayHomeSaveLives pic.twitter.com/pgeRc3FHIp\u2014 Boris Johnson #StayAlert (@BorisJohnson) March 31, 2020\n\n\"This was our wake-up call,\" Yuan told CNN Business over a Zoom interview from his San Jose home in April. Yuan blames himself for not anticipating that users might want to share a screenshot of a meeting. For his business clients, sharing a screenshot of your board meeting would be unthinkable. But business clients weren't his only worry anymore. The world had become his customer. Within a week, Zoom pushed out an update that would hide the meeting ID from view. But for Yuan and his team at Zoom, the damage had only just begun. Yuan built Zoom to please his customers \u2014 to use Zoom-speak he wanted to \"deliver happiness\" \u2014 and for years that meant giving his business clients a high-quality video conferencing platform that was easy-to-use. \"Frictionless,\" as the company likes to say. But during a global pandemic that has transformed Zoom into an essential tool for schools, church groups, weddings, and the cabinet of a G7 economy, Yuan is trying to figure out how to make Zoom something it was never meant to be. Now, \"Zoom is not only a business communication company, suddenly it's becoming an infrastructure company,\" Yuan said.Since the pandemic, Yuan has had little time to enjoy his family's multiplying fortune ($19 billion at last count, according to Forbes). He refers to April as one of the most stressful times in his life, which consisted of three things: Zooming, eating and sleeping, and he barely did much of the last one.\"I've had several sleepless nights\" Yuan said in front of a virtual background with the words \"WE CARE\" hovering over a heart-shaped earth. What is the question keeping the CEO of the company \u2014 one that is now worth more than double General Motors \u2014up at night?Yuan takes a breath. \"How did we get here?\"Zoom is headquartered in San Jose, California. (Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images)Shandong to Silicon ValleyYuan grew up in the Shandong Province in China in what he describes as a middle-class family. The child of geological engineers, Yuan was an average student who studied computer science, and after a stint working in Japan, decided he wanted to come to the center of technological innovation: Silicon Valley.\"I wanted to embrace that first wave of internet revolution,\" Yuan said. Yuan applied for an H-1B visa to come to America but was rejected. And then rejected again. And again. In what has now become part of his founder's lore, Yuan applied eight times before being accepted into the United States. Yuan entered Silicon Valley in 1997, during the first internet boom. Entranced by fast-growing companies like Netscape and Yahoo, who were revolutionizing the world's communications, Yuan wanted to get in on the ground floor of a bustling startup. He found it at WebEx, a young company \u2014 he was among the first 20 hires \u2014 whose goal was to leverage rapidly increasing bandwidth capabilities into online meetings where you could share your desktop screen easily and cheaply.  Yuan, who was 27 years old at the time of his arrival, fit into the global workforce of WebEx \u2014 a significant number of Chinese immigrants were recruited alongside Yuan \u2014 but found himself stymied by his inability to speak English. While he could understand the conversations around him, he says he couldn't participate. \"I couldn't join a marketing team or a sales team,\" said Yuan. \"I had to go back to writing code.\"Yuan's former colleagues associate Yuan's limited English (he still has a thick Chinese accent) with him being repeatedly overlooked. \"I saw a tremendous amount of unconscious bias against Eric because he didn't look the part, he didn't sound the part,\" says David Knight, a former VP of Product Management at WebEx. \"We put so much stock in how people communicate. We ascribe their eloquence to be their intelligence.\"While Yuan couldn't control how others understood his English, he focused on what he could control: his work.\"I knew two things from my father: keep working hard, stay humble, and someday you'll be OK,\" Yuan said.Eric Yuan speaks before the Nasdaq opening bell ceremony on April 18, 2019 in New York City. The company's IPO priced at $36 per share, at an estimated value of $9.2 billion. (Kena Betancur/Getty Images)The WebEx yearsWebEx was founded by two immigrants: Subrah Iyar came from India and ran marketing and sales, while Min Zhu, a Stanford-educated immigrant from China, was in charge of technical development. Both became mentors for Yuan. WebEx's early days were similar to many startups in the Valley: a flat, diffuse hierarchy that rewarded long hours from a loyal staff intent on changing the world. \"We were very scrappy,\" said Ed Wong, a friend of Yuan's who worked as a product manager with him at WebEx. Unlike other product-focused companies, WebEx sold itself as a cheap cloud-based \"SaaS\" (software as a service) that only required you to download its product: no expensive hardware purchases necessary. \"Your economics had to be different,\" explained Subrah Iyar to CNN Business. \"The price point for SaaS meant that you didn't get too much money upfront, you got it on a monthly basis.\"That SaaS model put tremendous pressure on the employees of WebEx to continually service and respond to their customer's demands. Companies were taking risks moving meetings and events online and any disruption in that service was seen by the WebEx team as an existential threat.\"Nobody thinks of web conferencing as mission critical. But when a meeting goes south and you've got eight or ten executives on the call, it's a big deal,\" said Knight. \"If WebEx was down for five minutes, I would spend the next month traveling and meeting customers, explaining to them why it happened and why it wouldn't happen again,\" said Velchamy Sankarlingam, who worked alongside Yuan as an engineer at WebEx. \"If your service goes down, you're going to get churn. People are going to switch away.\"Yuan proved his worth to Iyar and Zhu, rising to lead the engineering team as the company's fortunes grew. First there was the RuPaul Super Bowl ad in 2000, then a successful IPO later that year. WebEx even received an unlikely boost after 9/11. Amid global panic, companies who didn't want their employees flying unnecessarily instead turned to a service that could enable cheap and easy virtual meetings. And because WebEx was built on the cloud, Yuan and his engineering team's software could scale and meet the increasing demand. After first fielding an offer from IBM, Iyar and the WebEx board decided to sell their company in 2007 to Cisco for $3.2 billion.Yuan, who was so attached to WebEx that he referred to it as \"his baby,\" now found himself an employee of the one of the largest technology companies in the world. The WebEx team celebrates their IPO in 2000. WebEx cofounder Subrah Iyar, in a greige shirt, is flanked by Eric Yuan in a black polo shirt and hat. Yuan was an engineer for the company at the time. (Photo courtesy of Subrah Iyar)From fast-growing startup to a 'rounding error'Thanks to the Cisco acquisition, Yuan became a rich man. But while some WebEx employees took their earnings and split \u2014 wary of making the transition from fast-growing startup to cog in a Fortune 500 corporation \u2014 Yuan stuck around. It was still his baby after all. \"He wasn't ready to leave yet. He had a lot of loyalty,\" said David Knight, a VP at WebEx at the time of the acquisition. But, that loyalty was quickly tested. \"Almost immediately they started to dismiss everything that we did,\" said Matt Sheppard, then a WebEx employee. \"Eric was dismissed, along with the other leadership at WebEx, as being kind of second rate.\" But still, Yuan stayed. \"Every time I felt like leaving, I just got emotional,\" said Yuan, who worked at Cisco for four years. Former WebEx employees who made the transition to Cisco describe a key philosophical difference in how the two companies handled their customers. While WebEx's SaaS business model required them to serve their customers 24/7, Cisco made its billions selling physical routers and switches. \"It's a completely different mindset,\" said Sankarlingam. \"Cisco just sells the gear. And after that it's up to your network ... if a company's network goes down, nobody's going to go blame Cisco.\"WebEx, once a fast-growing startup, now was a cog in a blue-chip behemoth. \"We were a rounding error in Cisco's business,\" Knight said.Yuan felt for the first time that he couldn't satisfy his customers. He says his WebEx customers grew frustrated with the quality of the product. They wanted WebEx to work reliably and more intuitively. And above all else, they wanted video to run seamlessly. \"He was sincere, almost na\u00efve in that he always cared about the WebEx customers and that they were not being attended to,\" said Iyar, who was often told by Yuan that he should have never sold the company.Yuan would confide in Iyar that he felt like he was betraying the customer-obsessed ideals he learned at WebEx.  \"He had the advantage, in retrospect, that that's the only thing he grew up with, right? In a sense, one of his strengths is that he's a purist to that model,\" said Iyar.For Yuan, his time at Cisco turned out to be invaluable: it transformed him from engineer to entrepreneur. Yuan's frustrations at Cisco \"sparked the flames in his fire that he became very competitive,\" said Sheppard. Founding Zoom \"was purely a reaction to them not listening to him.\"A Cisco spokesperson told CNN Business in a statement that the WebEx acquisition was a \"very important one for us and changed the way the world works. We thank Eric for his time at Cisco.\"Zoom foundingYuan left Cisco in 2011, along with around 40 China-based WebEx engineers. Initial funding for his new company came from his acquaintances and former colleagues, including Subrah Iyar. \"If he told me he was sending a person to Mars I would have put money in,\" recalls Iyar. With funding and staff in place, Yuan could launch his new baby: Zoom. The pitch was simple. Build a better WebEx.

He just made it better and cheaper and higher quality and simpler and video-centered,\" said Knight, who left WebEx shortly before Yuan.  Yuan's plan to capture WebEx's enterprise market relied on building Zoom video-first. It would be cloud-based, run on Macs and PCs, iPhones and Androids, and you could make it work without downloading any software in your browser. But above all else, Yuan wanted to make his customers happy. \"I wanted to join a company where I woke up every morning and felt happy: I wanted to build a better solution to deliver happiness to the WebEx customers,\" said Yuan. \"That's it.\"AT&T, which owns CNN's parent company WarnerMedia, offers business customers Cisco's WebEx collaboration software, which competes with Zoom.'The Holy Grail'It turns out, what makes the customers of video conferencing happy are the things they don't have to think about. No one wants to download an app or sign up for an account if they don't have to. They just want the thing to work.  But ask any engineer and they'll tell you that making a simple product is never simple. \"You have to build a lot of discipline into the product,\" Oded Gal, a former WebEx veteran who now works alongside Yuan at Zoom as its Chief Product Officer, told CNN Business. Just as WebEx built a cutting-edge screensharing platform off the new bandwidth enabled by the DSL and T1 lines of the 1990s, Zoom would be built off the advanced data networks capable of streaming HD video. \"Video was not possible in the 2000s because the bandwidth was not there,\" said Iyer. \"That was changing.\"In a Zoom call, each user can upload upwards of two streams (one for video, one for screensharing) to a cloud server which then compresses each stream, adjusts the output for the bandwidth and CPU capability of each computer or phone, and sends them back, with as low a latency as possible. Multiply that by up to 100 users, and the problem becomes exponentially more complicated.\"You don't know what you don't see, you just experience the end result,\" said Iyar.

(Jeff Chiu/AP)\"Everybody thinks video conferencing is easy and it turns out the tech is really hard to do,\" says Knight. \"You don't control the network, you don't control the ISP, you don't control whether somebody turns the microwave on and interferes with the WiFi.\"While figuring out how to make scalable video calls was a daunting challenge, for Yuan's Zoom team, it was only half the battle. They also had to make Zoom frictionless enough that anyone could use it. So easy that it makes his customers happy. Zoom could work in any browser. It wouldn't need you to adjust your firewall settings. And unlike WebEx meetings, with their hard-to-remember pins and meeting IDs, Zoom would be accessible with a simple link. \"Getting rid of that user friction... in the tech world, it's kind of the holy grail,\" said Beth Kindig, technology analyst at beth.technology.  Zoom spreads Yuan's new baby was up and running. Yuan's plan for Zoom was to pilfer off WebEx's customers. To attract new users, Zoom began offering a freemium version of its product. Meetings under 40 minutes with up to 100 users would be free to use. Yuan's bet was that as more users tried Zoom, businesses would see that it worked better than WebEx, and would end up paying to switch to his new product.Zoom's freemium model gave it an entrance into a crowded marketplace where its competition were some of the largest companies in the world. Of course, there was Cisco's WebEx, but Zoom was also up against Microsoft and Google. But while companies might have had established deals with WebEx, Zoom's freemium accounts meant that the employees at those companies could just use Zoom.\"Everyone had Cisco WebEx, or they had Microsoft Suites,\" said Kindig. \"But everyone used Zoom because of how easy it was to just send out that link.\"The \"Saturday Night Live\" cast used Zoom to film the show from their homes. (SNL/Twitter)Live from Zoom, it's 'Saturday Night Live!'Zoom was winning. Yuan's freemium strategy worked and tech companies, entranced by Zoom's simplicity and efficiency, signed up for premium Zoom subscriptions. In a few short years, Zoom found itself the video conferencing market leader, and, after a successful 2019 IPO, Yuan became a billionaire multiple times over. Yuan's baby was all grown up. But a funny thing happened on the way to dominating the B2B remote video conferencing market: a global pandemic turned Zoom into a household name. With the world shutting down in a matter of weeks, every institution, every school, every college, every family now found themselves in desperate need of a way to communicate.

(Lindsey Wasson/Getty Images)\"You don't go into a pandemic with the video conferencing solution you wish you had. You go into the pandemic with the video conferencing solution you have,\" said Bill Marczak, a research fellow at the Citizen Lab. Over a mindboggling month of coronavirus-fueled growth \u2014 according to Zoom, its traffic rocketed up to 3,000% in May \u2014 Zoom unexpectedly joined Google, Kleenex and Band-Aid in the hallowed branding pantheon of proprietary eponyms. \"You free to Zoom?\" a phrase that would have been incomprehensible to the vast majority of us a couple of months ago, became an invitation your grandparents understood.And during an unprecedented spike in traffic, Zoom's cloud network, built on AWS and Oracle, scaled up to meet the crushing demand. Yuan's obsessions \u2014 his focus on video, on ease-of-use, on building scalable architecture \u2014 all paid off, and amid a cratering global market, Zoom's stock surged over 600% since the beginning of 2020. \n\nBut as Zoom transitioned from IT departments to \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\" and 10 Downing Street, security researchers began to dig into this newly ubiquitous company. Was this easy-enough-for-anyone-to-use product actually safe for any of us to use?'Speed at the expense of all else'The hits came quick. First it was \"Zoombombing.\" Then Zoom's encryption was discovered to be inadequate and its data was found to be routed through Chinese servers. Its privacy policy was picked apart.Lawsuits were filed, New York Attorney General Letitia James sent a letter asking whether the company \"is taking appropriate steps to ensure users' privacy and security,\" and institutions like NASA, New York City schools, and SpaceX banned their employees from using Zoom. Zoom says that the problems stem from its overnight transformation into an infrastructure company for the world. Before, Zoom expected its business customer base to have security teams who would enable best practices, like enabling passwords by default. Yuan wrote a blog stating that the servers located in China were an accident due to the surge in traffic, and Zoom data would not be routed through them again. \"[Yuan] realized that he has to be the IT department, the compliance department for the world, which I don't think he signed up,\" said Yuan's old mentor, Iyar. Zoom acted swiftly, quickly patching uncovered security vulnerabilities, purchasing Keybase, an encryption startup, instituting a 90-day product freeze, and hiring Alex Stamos, former chief security officer at Facebook, and Lea Kissner, formerly the global lead of privacy technology at Google to bolster its security team. The company has since come to an agreement with Attorney General James, and New York City public schools are now permitting its use.In November, Zoom settled with the Federal Trade Commission over what the agency described as \"unfair and deceptive security practices,\" including misleading its customers about whether end-to-end encryption was actually being used. \"The hundreds of millions of consumers who rely on Zoom every day to conduct business, get healthcare, educate their kids, and connect with family members have a right to expect the company to take steps to protect their personal information,\" the FTC wrote in a blog post. In a statement to CNN Business, Zoom said the FTC settlement was \"in keeping with our commitment to innovating and enhancing our product as we deliver a secure video communications experience.\"When you begin to examine Zoom's security vulnerabilities, a theme emerges. \"A lot of the security issues we saw seem to be the result of choices made that privileged user experience over security,\" said Marczak, who was part of the Citizen Lab team that uncovered security vulnerabilities in Zoom. \"You get this clear pattern where it looks like there were these vulnerabilities that were caused by decisions made to increase speed at the expense of all else.\"Musician Tati Diaz Bonilla plays the keyboard as a student listens and watches through Zoom during an online lesson from his apartment in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  (Marcelo Endelli/Getty Images)Marczak helped uncover a vulnerability in Zoom's \"waiting room.\" The waiting room is the first step of a password protected meeting, where the host could choose to let people in. Marczak and his colleague John Scott-Railton discovered that Zoom was sending an encrypted stream of the meeting to those not-yet-accepted. A savvy user could scoop up that data and spy on the meeting, \"presumably, so that when you were admitted the video would show instantly,\" explains Marczak. Or, take the Boris Johnson photo. Having the meeting ID visible on the top-left corner of the screen was an intentional choice to make Zoom's customers not have to dig around menus to find a meeting ID. \"We wanted it to be easier for the end user to let others join,\" Yuan said. But having a visible meeting ID meant that a screenshot posted on social media would allow anyone to enter the ID and join in (assuming that the meeting was not password protected).  \"Did we think about privacy? No, that's the problem,\" Yuan said. 'His product did so well, it broke'Zoom's security and privacy problems aren't Yuan's only concerns. On the heels of Pfizer's stunning announcement of a successful vaccine trial, Zoom's stock cratered, hinting at investor skepticism as to how the company would fare in a return to normalcy. And then there are the competitors, jealously eyeing the massive profits that Zoom has raked in over the last year. Open your Gmail app and you'll find a prominent \"Meet\" button, beckoning you to invite others into a video chat. Microsoft blanketed the airwaves with ads touting the Zoom-esque video chat features of its Teams platform and Facebook, no stranger to copying from a rising competitor, launched its \"Messenger Rooms\" back in April. Zoom's long-standing ties to China are also becoming an increasing liability. The company has utilized Chinese developers from its onset \u2014 its R&D department in China has over 700 employees \u2014 a practice that Zoom warned in its annual report \"could expose us to market scrutiny regarding the integrity of our solution or data security features.\" In April, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi erroneously referred to Zoom as a \"Chinese entity,\" while rejecting the idea of a Zoom enabled remote Congressional session. (Zoom is an American-based company, headquartered in San Jose). In July, a bipartisan group of senators wrote a letter to the Justice Department, urging them to investigate both Zoom and TikTok's connections to China.\"We believe that it is imperative that the Department of Justice investigate and determine whether Zoom and TikTok's business relationships, data handling practices, and operational connections to China pose a risk to Americans,\" wrote Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT). Yuan admitted to CNN Business in April that as tensions between China and the United States rise, Zoom might have to adjust its long-standing ties to China, suggesting Denver, Ohio or Virginia as possible sites for a relocated Zoom R&D center. \"If things get worse, we do have a plan,\" said Yuan. Subsequently Zoom announced it would triple its workforce in India, and open two R&D centers in Phoenix and Pittsburgh, with plans to hire \"up to 500 software engineers\" between the two cities.

(Horacio Villalobos/Corbis/Getty Images)Meanwhile, the safety of Zoom has remained a controversial subject amongst security researchers.\"Zoom is Malware,\" reads one headline, while a trio of security researchers published \"Zoom isn't Malware,\" offering a number of steps to bolster up security for the average user. And while Zoom's continued public lashing is ongoing, it could end up helping them in the long run.\"I think that probably a lot of CEOs are envious of his position,\" said Kindig. \"His product did so well, it broke.\"\"Thank you, Zoom, for listening,\" wrote Doc Searls, a technology journalist who had been highly critical of Zoom's privacy policies.  \"At least in public, they're taking all the right steps,\" echoed Marczak.More on ZoomZoom profit skyrockets 3,300% on remote work trendZoom is backing away from China \u2014 and doubling down on IndiaZoom's massive 'overnight success' actually took nine yearsYuan says the scrutiny that Zoom has received has been a blessing in disguise, allowing him to improve his company in ways that he never could have imagined otherwise. He now devotes his entire day only to security and privacy matters. \"The harshest criticism may be the best words you ever hear,\" Yuan muses.  Even in response to Nancy Pelosi wrongly describing Zoom as a \"Chinese entity\" Yuan blames himself.\"If the world misunderstands us, then I don't blame others, it's our problem... We are a very proud American company. The company is a public Nasdaq company, headquartered in San Jose. I'm a Chinese American. I truly believe... as long as you do the right thing, sooner or later they will know it... just be patient.\"\"In ten to twenty years, when people write the history of Covid-19, I want them to write that Zoom did the right thing for the world,\" Yuan said.

        "content": "Hong Kong  (CNN Business)Alana Tsui hadn't really thought about joining TikTok before the coronavirus pandemic. The artist and influencer already had a healthy following on Instagram. And like many other friends, the 31-year-old had dismissed TikTok as an app for pre-teens. But the spread of the virus in New York City forced Tsui to wait out the pandemic indoors, and she found herself with a lot of spare time to try something new. \"I thought, I'm in lockdown, I don't have anything to do ... and it looked fun,\" Tsui said. Now she finds herself sometimes posting four videos a day on the platform. These 12 essential apps will make quarantine bearableTsui is not alone. In the last few months, hundreds of millions of people around the world have downloaded the short-form video app as the United States, Europe and elsewhere impose strict restrictions in order to curb the spread of the coronavirus.Read MoreFor many people, the app has become a fun escape from all the grim news about the virus and its economic toll. TikTok has seized on the moment, pushing upbeat hashtags such as \"#HappyAtHome,\" which has seen many users rope their parents into doing TikTok videos. It is also promoting live streams of soothing content: On a recent Wednesday, for example, one such stream was broadcasting live footage from a panda sanctuary. The promotions appear to be paying off. TikTok was downloaded 315 million times from January through March, according to Sensor Tower \u2014 an amount that the analytics company says topped any other app ever for a single quarter. TikTok now has 2 billion downloads overall, doubling its total from just 15 months ago.The company is also winning over coveted users, like Hong Kong-based content creator and influencer Taylor Richard, who boasts more than 300,000 followers on Instagram (owned by Facebook (FB)) and 1.1 million subscribers on YouTube (owned by Google (GOOGL)). She said TikTok approached her last year to come join its platform. Richard, 31, thought it skewed a bit too young for her.          View this post on Instagram           My Pajama Collection \ud83d\udcab I got 6 looks. A post shared by  Taylor R (@taytay_xx) on Apr 23, 2020 at 8:21am PDT Then the coronavirus outbreak hit, and Richard found herself hooked on TikTok's 15-second videos. She also liked that more \"older people, like my generation and older, are joining it. And a lot of the songs are from my generation,\" she said. Richard, who has about 15,000 followers on the app, joined in early April and TikTok now sends her weekly emails, telling her which hashtags are performing well, and giving examples of trending video content.   The record-breaking influx of new users is a major win for app owner ByteDance, which has been trying to capitalize on TikTok's worldwide appeal. The app is the only social media platform made by a Chinese company to gain significant traction outside of China. But the Beijing-based startup's success inside of China during the pandemic has also been enormous \u2014 and may provide clues as to how TikTok hopes to grow into a major money maker in the future. A record quarterly haul  ByteDance's mobile apps raked in $157 million from January to March, according to Sensor Tower. Close to 90% of that amount came from China, and was almost entirely driven by Douyin, the Chinese version of the company's killer app. It was a record quarterly haul for ByteDance, representing a 423% increase compared to the same period a year earlier, and up 50% compared to the previous quarter.Bytedance did not respond to requests for comment for this article.The first week of February was Douyin's biggest week ever, with users spending over 3 billion hours in the app \u2014 up 130% from the weekly average in 2019, according to analytics company AppAnnie. In China, live-streaming is very popular. Influencers often make money by receiving virtual tips during live streams. \"In general on Chinese apps, there's a habit of tipping content creators,\" said Wiktoria Marsza\u0142ek, an account manager with Nanjing Marketing Group, a company that helps foreign firms grow their brands and sales in China.FaceTime dance parties and digital picture frames: How people are staying connected to their grandparentsFor example, she said, Douyin users buy virtual donuts or hearts that they can gift to content creators or influencers during live streams. All of that translates into in-app revenue for ByteDance. The company still makes most of its money from advertising. Consulting firm R3 estimates that ByteDance made about 140 billion yuan ($19.8 billion) in advertising revenue in 2019.\"In many categories, it outstripped Tencent (TCEHY) and Baidu  (BIDU)to become the No 1 adverting platform\" in China, said Greg Paull, a principal with R3. But the in-app revenue it gets from Douyin and TikTok users is more than just chump change. Douyin and TikTok revenue \"is skyrocketing now,\" said Randy Nelson, an analyst with Sensor Tower. Sensor Tower views TikTok and Douyin as essentially the same app, citing the similarities in branding, marketing and user experience.Nelson said the app's success in monetizing users vaults it into the same league as top entertainment companies. When it comes to non-gaming apps, TikTok ranked third in March for global in-app revenue, after dating app Tinder and YouTube. Disney's (DIS) new streaming app and Netflix (NFLX) rounded out the top five. \"It was above Disney+, it was above Netflix. And that's without Android in China,\" he added. Sensor Tower can only track data from the App Store and the Google Play store, and the Play store is banned China. Bytedance raked in $157 million last quarter, the vast majority of which came from Douyin, TikTok's Chinese sister app.Some influencers are betting on TikTok post-pandemicTikTok has not seen as much of a windfall as Douyin, because it only started monetizing through advertising and live streaming last year, according to a TikTok spokesperson. But Douyin provides clues as to how TikTok hopes to emulate the financial success of its Chinese sister app. For example, TikTok last year made live streaming available to users with a certain number of followers. It remains to be seen if the feature will take off outside of China, though. Westerners are \"not as used to the Chinese style of live streaming\" where influencers stream for hours just to hawk goods, said Marsza\u0142ek, of Nanjing Marketing Group. \"In China they're just sell, sell, sell,\" she said. Nurses and doctors are flocking to TikTok to crack jokes and lip sync. But are they eroding patients' trust?Giving virtual money to content creators on social media isn't common practice either \u2014 Facebook has an in-app currency that it introduced so users could tip content creators, but it has never gained traction, according to Nelson, of Sensor Tower. TikTok has also begun experimenting with e-commerce buttons for select advertisers and influencers, according to Digiday. The ad revenue would be split between TikTok and the influencer, similar to what is already done in China on Douyin.  Like many other social media companies, TikTok is anticipating the coronavirus will deal a blow to advertising revenue in the United States, Europe and other markets where it operates. It has begun \"donating\" advertising credits to health organizations so they can post updates about the pandemic. TikTok will be offering more free ad space to restaurants and small businesses when they start to re-open, the spokesperson said. Once companies start spending again, users like Tsui are betting TikTok will be where they splash out money. With dance challenges and explainer videos, publishers invade TikTok to court Gen ZBefore moving to New York, Tsui lived in Hong Kong where she earned about $1,500 per month partnering with brands and advertisers to promote their wares to her 74,000 followers on Instagram. Breaking through on Instagram in New York has proved difficult. But now, \"because everyone is talking about TikTok, the brands are really targeting influencers and doing ads on TikTok,\" she said.  Tsui joined TikTok at the beginning of April. One of her posts managed to land a coveted spot on the app's \"For You\" feed \u2014 a place where users can watch content that TikTok's algorithm believes they will like, based on past behavior in the app. Tsui went from 17 followers to more than 10,000 overnight. She currently has about 27,000 followers. The New Zealand native is now trying to figure out TikTok's notoriously opaque algorithm in the hopes that she can develop a strong enough following to bring in earnings. \"I definitely think TIkTok is the way to go in the future in terms of advertising and product promotion,\" Tsui said.",

        "content": "When shoppers entered H&M's flagship store in central London last summer, the first thing they would have seen was a dark blue, flowery minidress hanging front and center. On sale for just \u00a34 (or $4.80 US), the dress featured more than a low price tag. It also boasted a green label with the word \"CONSCIOUS.\"Further down the aisle, recycling bins stood next to a collection of striped t-shirts and dresses.This setup is not uncommon in H&M's 4,473 stores stores across the world. That's because the company wants to be seen as a climate champion. The Swedish clothing empire runs an array of sustainability programs, encouraging customers to bring back unwanted clothes for reuse. It's been releasing annual sustainability reports since 2002 and launched its first Conscious Collection using organic cotton and recycled materials in 2010. More recently, the H&M Group announced a plan to make all its apparel from recycled or sustainably-sourced materials by 2030. It has also tried adding \"repair and remake\" stations in select stores, and it's testing clothing rentals in Stockholm.Read MoreLike its other fast fashion rivals, H&M's core business model is fueled by low prices, rapid consumption and fast-changing trends \u2014 all of which are in direct tension with its sustainability mission. The global fashion industry generates a huge amount of waste - one full garbage truck of clothes is burned or sent to a landfill every second, according to the a report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a leading non-profit working to improve the industry's sustainability record.H&M displays dresses from its 2018 Conscious Exclusive collection. The retailer wants to be seen as a climate champion \u2014 but that sustainability mission is in direct tension with its fast fashion business model. (Stefanie Keenan/Getty Images for H&M)When a shirt costs $5, it's quickly seen as disposable. We are more likely to dispose of cheaper, mass-produced clothes than more expensive items, according to a 2009 study into consumer habits. H&M is well aware of the problem. The company's Sustainability Engagement Manager Hendrik Alpen admitted the fast fashion industry is struggling to balance its climate commitment with its desire to meet consumer demands. \"It's not exactly rocket science, if you look at how the global population will develop, by 2040, we might be 9 billion people. That is of course great from the perspective of having more potential customers,\" Alpen told CNN Business. \"But if we look at the planetary boundaries ... the equation is not working out.\"Pi\u00f1atex garments with an H&M Conscious label. (Ivana Kottasova/CNN) How clothes are harming the planetCollectively, the global fashion industry produces nearly 4 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, or 8.1% of the world total, according to Quantis, a climate consultancy that analyzes the fashion industry's environmental impact. That calculation includes the seven life stages of a garment, beginning with creating the fibers used to make it \u2014 by growing cotton, for example \u2014 to assembling the clothing and eventually, transporting and selling it. The estimates consider both apparel and footwear.When you're standing in a mall or shopping online and ready to click \"buy,\" it's hard to fathom the global consequences of individual purchases. But consider the impact of a single cotton t-shirt or a pair of jeans as examples.The process of making one cotton t-shirt emits about 5 kilograms of carbon dioxide \u2014 around the amount produced during a 12-mile car drive. It also uses as much as 1,750 liters of water. That's in part because cotton is a water-guzzling crop. Inefficient irrigation, as well as the bleaching and dying process, add to the water usage, Quantis told CNN Business.Producing a pair of jeans consumes even more water \u2014 around 3,000 liters \u2014 due to the dyeing and bleaching involved, according to calculations by Quantis. Making a single pair of jeans emits around 20 kg of CO2, the same amount produced during a 49-mile car journey.There are more sustainable ways to grow cotton that include relying mainly on rainwater, rotating crops to preserve soil quality and limiting the use of pesticides. However, sustainable cotton remains a niche product, comprising only about 15% of the 2017 global total, according to the CottonUp initiative.In 2017, the fashion industry devoured around 79 billion cubic meters of water, enough to fill nearly 32 million Olympic-sized swimming pools. And it's only expected to get worse. The Global Fashion Agenda and Boston Consulting Group expect the fashion industry's water usage will increase another 50% by 2030. That's a threat, they warn, particularly to cotton-producing countries, which are quickly running out of water. Researchers at the Twente Water Centre at the University of Twente in the Netherlands say 4 billion people experience severe water scarcity for at least one month each year. Nearly half of those people live in India and China, the world's top two cotton producers. In Central Asia, another major cotton region, cotton farming is partly responsible for drying up the Aral Sea, once one of the four largest freshwater lakes in the world.     It doesn't end with the production. Washing clothes can also have a detrimental effect on the environment, especially because of synthetic materials like polyester that contain plastic fibers. After frequent washes, those fibers break down into microplastics, which can make their way to oceans and harm marine wildlife. \"60% of materials used by the industry are plastic fibers [and] the equivalent of 50 billion plastic bottles are leaked into the ocean through garment wash every year,\" said Francois Souchet, who leads the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's Make Fashion Circular program which  brings together all the key players to create more sustainable fashion. Denim manufacturer Levi Strauss is on a mission to change this.For years the company has been encouraging its customers to reduce the number of times they wash their jeans. A 2013 report commissioned by the company revealed that consumer care was responsible for 23% of water used in the life cycle of its jeans. Levi's also found a way to create its signature faded denim, by using just a thimble of water and ozone gas instead of the traditional method, which can use up to 42 liters of water.The company uses stones instead of water to achieve the \"worn-in\" look.  This technique has reduced the volume of water used in garment finishing by 96% since 2011, the company says.A worker unloads jeans from a fabric dyeing machine at a factory in India. (Dhiraj Singh/Bloomberg/Getty Images)Sustainability comes at a high price H&M launched its Conscious Collection in 2010. To qualify for a \"Conscious\" label, clothes must contain at least 50% sustainable materials, such as organic cotton or recycled polyester, according to the H&M website. The company was accused of \"greenwashing\" consumers by being vague about the collection's sustainability credentials. Last summer, the Norwegian Consumer Authority sent a letter to H&M, accusing the company of misleading consumers with overly general sustainability claims associated with its Conscious Collection. The NCA told CNN Business that the information on H&M's website did not specify the amount of recycled material used in each garment.\"We think this is information that the consumer should have available as the clothing is marketed as recycled,\" said Elisabeth Lier Haugseth, NCA director general. \"You should know if this means 2% of the clothing material or 50%.\"When asked about this, Alpen, the H&M sustainability manager, said the company would take the criticism and learn to \"communicate that extra value\" to consumers. The Conscious Collection includes items like a vegan pink jacket made from Pi\u00f1atex, a leather-like material made out of pineapple waste and recycled polyester rather than animal hides.The catch: it originally cost $299.We consumers have a lot of power. I think we all know we don't need 20 t-shirts. That maybe it's better to pay a little bit more and have two t-shirts.\"Carmen Hijosa, founder of Ananas Anam and creator of Pi\u00f1atexThat price tag, which stands out in a sea of otherwise super-cheap clothes, illustrates a hard truth; although H&M is making more of an effort to talk about climate change, it's hard to scale up sustainable practices and still keep prices low. Developed by leather goods specialist Carmen Hijosa, Pi\u00f1atex has become a sought-after material. Hijosa has teamed up with a number of luxury designers, including Hugo Boss, Trussardi and Edun, in addition to her H&M collaboration. She hopes to scale her company so Pi\u00f1atex can eventually supply more apparel-makers with a leather alternative at a lower price point. For now, she acknowledges the $299 H&M jacket is probably out of reach for many consumers. In an effort to encourage people to donate clothing rather than toss it aside, Levi Strauss & Co. displayed 19,000 pairs of jeans at a stadium in 2014. (Jed Jacobsohn/Getty Images for Levi's)But she also told CNN Business that it's up to shoppers, too, to play their part - by purchasing fewer and longer-lasting goods.\"We consumers have a lot of power. I think we all know we don't need 20 t-shirts,\" she said. \"Maybe it's better to pay a little bit more and have two t-shirts.\"\"I think we are much, much more aware,\" she added. \"People stop for five seconds and think: 'if I buy this, it's going to be a waste in six months time, if I buy this, it's going to last longer, it [costs] more, but I am going to use it more'.\"Throwaway fashionFast fashion companies produce billions of garments each year to provide their consumers with the latest trends. Critics, ranging from Greenpeace to the UK Parliament, say such mass production promotes the idea that clothes are disposable and encourages excessive waste.Over half of fast fashion items are thrown away in under a year, according to estimates by management consultancy giant McKinsey & Company.The problem is becoming apparent. In its 2019 \"Fixing Fashion\" report, the UK's House of Commons' environmental audit committee proposed that the government introduce a fast fashion tax to combat consumers' disposable mindset. The inquiry's tagline: \"Fashion: it shouldn't cost the Earth.\"  The committee's overarching message was straight forward: People need to rethink the way they dress by buying fewer but higher quality items that will last. \"Isn't the real problem with the fast fashion industry that if you are selling stuff at \u00a35 people aren't going to treat it with any respect and at the end of its life it's going to go in the bin?\" asked Mary Creagh, the parliamentarian who chaired the committee.  The proposed tax was tiny, just one pence (or about 1 US cent) per item. The lawmakers wanted to use the revenue to stop clothes from going to a landfill. And ultimately the government rejected the idea, saying it wanted to focus on eliminating single-use plastic first.Most used clothing isn't recycledIn a bid to play its part, H&M launched a recycling program in 2012, allowing customers to exchange unwanted clothes for discount vouchers.  H&M's latest sustainability report stated that of the used garments it collected, 50% to 60% were sorted for rewear or reuse. About 35% to 45% were recycled to become non-fashion products like cleaning cloths or insulation materials or made into new textile fibers. The remaining 3% to 7% that could not be recycled were burnt for energy production. 0% ends up in landfill.  The company aims to operate a 100% circular business model by 2030, which means ensuring that there is \"no end of life [for materials] but creating a closed loop where everything is used as long and as often as possible and ultimately recycled,\" Alpen said.Pi\u00f1atex jackets including the one developed for H&M's Conscious Exclusive collection (left). (Ivana Kottasova/CNN)But some critics call this yet another example of greenwashing on the part of the company. Orsola de Castro, a designer and a co-founder of Fashion Revolution, a non-profit global movement, said that the industry's focus on circularity is a sign that the biggest companies are \"hell-bent on continuing\" with their current business model.\"These brands know very well that just throwing a couple of millions at some experimental circularity [project] was not going to solve the problem, but it was going to give them the opportunity to say 'in the future, we can produce as much we want, you will be able to buy as much as you want, because ultimately, we will recycle everything', but that is absolutely not true,\" she said. The future the companies talk about, she said, is so far away, it won't make a difference any time soon. \"We need to usher in a different behaviour by changing buying habits in the meantime, and that to me is slowing down,\" she added.H&M Group says it collected more than 29,005 metric tons of unwanted clothing in 2019, but admits that for many types of textiles, viable recycling solutions either do not exist or are not commercially available at scale.Worldwide as of 2015, 73% of clothes ended up in landfills or incinerators because they cannot be recycled, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a non-profit working to improve the industry's sustainability record. Signage at an H&M Conscious event showcases the company's ambitions to eventually get to a 100% circular business model by 2030. (Brian Ach/Getty Images for H&M)The main challenge is a lack of recycling infrastructure for textiles. Current technology only allows less than 1% of clothing to be recycled into new apparel, Francois Souchet, who leads the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's Make Fashion Circular program, told CNN Business. He said the fashion industry should design clothes with end of use in mind by integrating recyclable materials, such as lyocell, a fiber made from biodegradable wood pulp.\"The products are not designed to be turned into new [items] or refreshed in style...the materials that are used mean you cannot economically recycle clothes,\" he added.Most experts and fashion companies acknowledge the task ahead is huge and will require a multitude of solutions and technology that is not yet available. \"I don't think there is a truly sustainable fashion business, but looking at the rest of the industry today, I can say very confidently that H&M is one of the most sustainable options out there,\" Alpen said.",

        "content": "Hong Kong (CNN Business)Wearing a striped shirt and Matrix-style dark glasses, Onel de Guzman stared at the floor as he made his way through a crowd of photographers into a hastily arranged press conference in Quezon City, a suburb of the Philippines capital Manila.  Skinny, with a mop of black hair falling to his eyebrows, he appeared to barely register the journalists' shouted questions, his only movement the occasional dabbing of sweat from his face with a white towel. Seated to his right, de Guzman's lawyer Rolando Quimbo had to lean in close to hear the 23-year-old's mumbled response, which he then repeated in English for the waiting press. \"He is not really aware that the acts imputed to him were indeed done by him,\" the lawyer said. \"So if you ask me whether or not he was aware of the consequences I would say that he is not aware.\" It was May 11, 2000, and if de Guzman was feeling shell-shocked, he had good reason to be. He was accused of authoring and releasing the first truly global computer virus that had disrupted the operations of businesses and government agencies the world over, from Ford (F) and Merrill Lynch to the Pentagon and the British Parliament, and was on track to cause a estimated $10 billion in damages \u2014 all in the name of love. Twenty years on, the ILOVEYOU virus remains one of the farthest reaching ever. Tens of millions of computers around the world were affected. The fight to contain the malware and track down its author was front page news globally, waking up a largely complacent public to the dangers posed by malicious cyber actors. It also exposed vulnerabilities which we are still dealing with to this day, despite two decades of advances in computer security and technology. Read MoreThis account of the virus is based on interviews with law enforcement and investigators involved in the original case, contemporaneous CNN reporting and reports by the FBI, Philippines police and the Pentagon.Multiple attempts to reach Onel de Guzman for this article, including through his family and former lawyer, were unsuccessful. De Guzman had not commented publicly since around 2000, until this week when author Geoff White tracked him down to the phone repair shop he now runs in Manila, where he admitted to authoring the virus. LovestruckOn the afternoon of May 4, 2000, Michael Gazeley was in his office at Star Computer City, a warren of IT companies and shops selling electronics and gadgets overlooking Hong Kong's Victoria Harbor.A few months earlier, Gazeley and his longtime business partner, Mark Webb-Johnson, founded their own information security firm, Network Box, which specialized in protecting customers from online threats. Both men had decades of experience in the industry, and had just finished the grueling (though occasionally lucrative) work of preparing for the new millennium by staving off the Y2K bug that threatened to cause widespread damage to systems worldwide. Though largely remembered today, much to the chagrin of those involved, as an overreaction \u2014 or worse, a hoax \u2014 the Y2K bug was real, and the potential costs massive. They were avoided thanks to the diligent efforts of programmers around the world working together. It was a sign of the new connectivity that the internet, still in its relative infancy, was fostering. That connectivity cut both ways, however, as Gazeley was reminded of that afternoon. All the phones in his office started ringing at once. First were his clients, then came non-customers, all calling frantically in the hope that Network Box could help stop a virus that was screaming through their systems, destroying and corrupting data as it went. They all told the same story: Someone in the office had received an email with the subject \"ILOVEYOU\" and the message, \"kindly check the attached LOVELETTER coming from me.\" When they opened what appeared to be a text file \u2014 actually an executable program masquerading as one \u2014 the virus quickly took control, sending copies of itself to everyone in their email address book. Those recipients, thinking the email was either some weird joke or a serious declaration of love, opened the attachment in turn, spreading it even further. A screenshot showing a copy of the ILOVEYOU virus email which spread around the world in May 2000.Office email servers were soon clogged as thousands of love letters went back and forth, disseminating the virus to more people. It turned out to be much worse than just a self-propelling chain letter. At the same time as it was replicating itself, the ILOVEYOU virus destroyed much of the victim's hard drive, renaming and deleting thousands of files. Many of the increasingly panicked callers Gazeley was fielding inquiries from did not have backups, and he had the awkward job of explaining to them that many of their files \u2014 everything from spreadsheets and financial records to photos and mp3s \u2014 were likely lost for good. \"This wasn't something that people were used to as a concept, they didn't realize that email could be so dangerous,\" said Gazeley, recounting the first calls. The entire concept of the internet was still relatively new in 2000. According to statistics from the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), a United Nations body, just 28% of Hong Kongers had access to the internet at that time, along with 27% of the United  Kingdom, and 15% of France. Even in the United States, where the technology was invented, only some 43% of Americans were getting online. Two years earlier, Hollywood star Meg Ryan asked \"is it infidelity if you're involved with somebody on email?\" as the movie \"You've Got Mail\" introduced people to the idea of cyber-romance \u2014 and that email could be used for something other than boring office work. Network Box co-founder Michael Gazeley was among the first cybersecurity experts to have to tackle the ILOVEYOU virus.Computer chaosFrom Hong Kong, where the virus crippled the communications and ravaged file systems of investment banks, public relations firms and the Dow Jones newswire, the love bug spread westward as the May 4 workday started. Graham Cluley was on stage at a security conference in Stockholm, Sweden, when the virus hit Europe. He had just finished describing an unrelated virus which targeted a now-defunct operating system, hijacking users' accounts to broadcast messages to their coworkers, including \"Friday I'm in LOVE.\" This, Cluley cracked, was likely to cause severe embarrassment for most people, but could potentially lead to some office romance.As the conference broke for coffee, attendees' mobile phones and pagers began going off wildly. Several guests approached Cluley, asking if the virus he'd described was spread via email. He assured them it wasn't \u2014 and, anyway, it was limited to a niche system that most people didn't use. \"They said, Well, that's weird because we're suddenly getting loads of emails with the subject line 'I love you,'\" Cluley said in an interview from his home in the United Kingdom. When Cluley turned on his own phone, he was bombarded with notifications of missed calls, voice mails and text messages. Back home, Cluley's employer, the anti-virus firm Sophos, had been getting \"absolutely hammered\" with phone calls from clients begging for help and journalists trying to understand what the hell was going on.Cluley raced to the airport to catch a flight to London, and even traded phone batteries with a generous taxi driver as the constant stream of messages drained his Nokia cellphone of power. When he landed in the United Kingdom, a car was waiting to whisk him to a TV studio to discuss what had by now become one of the biggest tech stories in the world. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDestructive viruses timeline\n\n\n\n\n1991\n\nMichelangelo virus predicted to take down millions of machines, but in the end only a handful are affected.\n\n\n\n\n1999\n\nMelissa, an email worm named after a Florida topless dancer, spreads to thousands of computers worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n2000\n\nILOVEYOU virus clogs up email servers and causes billions of dollars in damages worldwide\n\n\n\n\n\n2001\n\nAnna Kournikova worm uses promise of photos of the tennis star to inflict repeat of ILOVEYOU chaos.\n\n\n\n\n2005-2007\n\nStuxnet virus begins targeting Iranian nuclear facilities in example of what some later describe as \"first cyberwar weapon\".\n\n\n\n\n2008\n\nConficker virus creates \"botnet\" of millions of infected machines but ultimately is never used.\n\n\n\n\n2011\n\nDuqu virus discovered and said to be related to Stuxnet, sparking renewed fears of a potential cyber arms race.\n\n\n\n\n2013\n\nHackers use CryptoLocker virus to seize computers and force people to pay to restore access in new \"ransomware\" attack.\n\n\n\n\n2016\n\nDenial of service attack launched via Mirai botnet -- which uses infected internet-of-things devices -- knocks dozens of major sites offline.\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\nWannaCry ransomware attack strikes businesses and public institutions around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: US Army\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn five hours, ILOVEYOU spread across Asia, Europe and North America, some 15 times faster than the Melissa virus did when it struck a year before, infecting over 1 million computers.Soon after starting business on May 4, the United Kingdom's House of Commons had to take its overloaded email servers offline, as did the Ford Motor Company and even Microsoft, whose Outlook software was the primary means of spreading the virus.  At the time, Windows controlled more than 95% of the personal computer market, and Outlook came bundled with Microsoft Office, then all-but-required for doing business on a computer. For most people, Outlook was email. Unlike today, when many email services are run via centralized servers \u2014 think Outlook.com or Gmail \u2014 companies in 2000 were running email off the same servers on which they hosted their website. This could be janky, slow and startling insecure. Back then, Cluley said, \"many companies didn't have in place filters their email gateways to try and stop spam, let alone viruses.\"Even though the United States had advance warning, the virus spread just as quickly there \u2014 as almost everyone seemed apparently unable to resist opening the \"love letter.\" Within the Pentagon, there was consternation as the virus hit the United States Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) mailing list, with 50,000 subscribers. From there, almost every major military base in the country \u2014 barring a handful that didn't use Outlook \u2014 watched as their email services were crippled and forced offline for hours as the problem was fixed.      Searching for the culpritAcross the Potomac River, at the FBI's Washington, DC, headquarters, Michael Vatis was scrambling to get a handle on the crisis. As director of the National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC), a relatively new intergovernmental agency tasked with tackling cyber threats, Vatis was awoken early May 4 with news of the ILOVEYOU virus hitting the United States. The NIPC soon sent out an alert warning of a \"new, in-the-wild worm virus identified as LoveLetter or LoveBug [that] is being propagated globally via e-mail,\" but it came too late to prevent much of the US government and military, as well as dozens of private companies, from being affected. As anti-virus companies slowly began rolling out patches, stemming the damage and enabling companies to come back online, attention within the FBI turned to tracking down those responsible. The investigation was led by the New York field office, which soon found evidence pointing back east, beyond Hong Kong, to the Philippines. \"In a very short period of time, we ended up identifying individuals in the Philippines and seeking the assistance of Philippine law enforcement,\" said Vatis, now a partner at the New York law firm Steptoe. \"And a very short time after that, the Philippine authorities ultimately made an arrest.\" Both the technical fix and first break in the case came so fast because, for all its rapid dissemination around the world, the ILOVEYOU virus was clumsily coded and startlingly unsophisticated. It mashed together several existing pieces of malware and did little to hide its workings. \"Every single victim of the love bug got a copy of the love bug's code, the actual source code,\" said Cluley, the Sophos analyst. \"So it was simple to write an antidote. It was no more complex than any of the other thousands and thousands of viruses we'd seen that day. But of course, this one was particularly successful at spreading itself.\" As well as containing the blueprint for defeating it, the code also included some lines pointing to the identity of its author. It contained two email addresses \u2014 spyder@super.net.ph and mailme@super.net.ph \u2014 both of which were based in the Philippines. There was also a reference to GRAMMERSoft Group, which it said was based in the country's capital. While investigators were wary that those clues could be a smokescreen, the virus also communicated with a server hosted by the Manila-based Sky Internet, to which it sent passwords scraped from victims' computers. Sky quickly took the server offline, which stopped at least part of the virus in its tracks.Without the servers to send information to \u2014 and it appears the virus's author was never able to access what was sent to the server, or at least act upon it \u2014 ILOVEYOU became purely an engine of chaos and destruction. It churned through email inboxes around the world and deleted files, while not actually serving the apparent original purpose of scraping passwords.      A suspect emergesFour days after the virus began spreading, Philippines police searched an apartment in Manila and seized computer magazines, telephones, disks, wires and cassette tapes. They also arrested one of the occupants, Reomel Ramones. Ramones, a curly-haired 27-year-old who worked at a local bank, seemed like an unlikely computer hacker, and investigators wondered if they had arrested the wrong guy. Attention turned to the apartment's two other residents: Ramones' girlfriend, Irene de Guzman, and her brother, Onel. Onel de Guzman \u2014 who was not in the apartment when it was raided, and could not be found \u2014 was a student at AMA Computer College. The college was home to a self-described hacking group, the now-defunct GRAMMERSoft, which specialized in helping other students cheat on their homework. While police could not prove initially that de Guzman was a member, officials at the school shared with them a rejected final thesis he had written, which contained the code for a program bearing a startling resemblance to ILOVEYOU. In the draft thesis, de Guzman wrote that the goal of his proposed program was to \"get Windows passwords\" and \"steal and retrieve internet accounts [from] the victim's computer.\" At the time, dial-up internet access in the Philippines was paid for by the minute, in contrast to the blanket-use fees in much of Europe and the United States. De Guzman's idea was that users in the developing world could piggyback on the connections of those in richer countries and \"spend more time on [the] internet without paying.\" Reading his proposal, de Guzman's teacher was outraged, and wrote \"we don't produce burglars\" and \"this is illegal\" in the margins. But while the thesis would cost de Guzman his degree, his teacher's argument about illegality would be proven incorrect.Onel de Guzman, seen here in May 2000, was quickly accused of being the author of the ILOVEYOU virus. Legal loopholeAfter several days out of the public eye, de Guzman appeared at the press conference in Quezon, flanked by his lawyer and sister. Asked whether he might have been responsible for the virus, he responded through his lawyer: \"It is possible.\" \"He did not even know that the actions on his part would really come to the results which have been reported,\" his lawyer said. To a ripple of laughter from reporters, the lawyer added, after a mumbled consultation with de Guzman: \"The internet is supposed to be educational so it should be free.\" Asked what he felt about the damage caused by the virus, de Guzman said \"nothing, nothing.\" Nothing would also turn out to be de Guzman's punishment, despite reams of evidence gathered by police in the Philippines and the agreement of the country's National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), the FBI and private security investigators, that he was the culprit. The problem was not a lack of proof, but the lack of an appropriate law to charge him with. The Philippines, like a number of countries at the turn of the millennium, had not legislated against computer crime. And an attempt to prosecute de Guzman on fraud charges was later dropped. While the Philippines did have an extradition treaty with the United States, it only applied to crimes prosecutable in both countries. Once the case was dropped, there was little chance of sending de Guzman abroad. While Philippines lawmakers did rush through a law criminalizing computer hacking soon after the ILOVEYOU incident, it could not be applied retroactively. \"We were unable to bring to justice a wrongdoer who caused harm to millions of people and companies around the world,\" Senator Edgardo J. Angara said years later, echoing the embarrassment felt by many Philippines politicians and law enforcement officers.  For others in the country, de Guzman was a hero. \"Here is a Filipino genius who has put the Philippines on the world map,\" wrote one newspaper columnist. \"[He] has proven that the Filipino has the creativity and ingenuity to turn, for better or for worse, the world upside down.\" It even spawned a movie, \"Subject: I love you,\" which depicted the virus creator as a lovelorn man trying to reconnect \"with the only woman he had ever loved.\" At de Guzman's college, a fellow student told the New York Times, the virus had \"made us proud.\" Another basked in the ability of a Filipino hacker to \"penetrate the Pentagon ... even though the Philippines is a third-world country, even though we're behind in technology, they were able to do that.\" Two decades on, this reaction still annoys Cluley, the Sophos investigator. \"It's the kind of thing that has you thumping your head against a wall in frustration,\" he said. \"This was when malware was just beginning to get a little nastier and a little more malicious and more financially motivated.\"\"This wasn't the message we wanted to give young people, that this was all right.\"The risk of attacks like ILOVEYOU has not gone away. So-called ransomware attacks which targeted many businesses in 2017 relied on just the same kind of social engineering as the love bug. Long legacyThere were admirers of de Guzman's work outside the Philippines, too. Within hours of ILOVEYOU spreading, remixed copycats had sprung up, with messages such as \"very funny,\" \"joke,\" \"Mother's Day,\" or, most cynically, \"VIRUS ALERT!!!\" Amazingly, despite the near wall-to-wall media coverage of the ILOVEYOU virus at the time, this did not stop many people opening suspicious attachments which bore a different message. The love bug and its variants would cause some $10 billion of damage, the FBI later estimated, before updates to anti-virus software and email clients reined them in. To this day, ILOVEYOU remains one of the farthest reaching viruses, striking millions of machines in countries across the world. \"It had an enormous effect,\" said Vatis, the former NIPC director. \"It was really worldwide front page news for at least several days in a way that computer attacks had not been in the past.\" While previous attacks had caused more direct damage, and those in the future would be more sophisticated and far more effective in their goal, they were also much more limited in scope. Other viruses have targeted specific locations, businesses or governments. ILOVEYOU could affect just about anyone running Windows Outlook. \"It hit home in a way that other previous attacks did not,\" Vatis said. \"It made people aware that this is not just something that happens to defense agencies or owners of websites, this is something that can happen to any Joe or Jane sitting at home on the computer or in the office, and it can shut you down and really disrupt your ability to operate.\" And while email clients have gotten better at filtering out malicious-seeming messages, the main weakness that ILOVEYOU exploited remains impossible to fix. \"You can update your operating systems or you can have the best email filters in the world, but you can't patch the human brain,\" said Cluley. To this day, some of the most successful cyber attacks \u2014 whether they be linked to nation-state actors, criminal organizations or lone-wolf hackers \u2014 have used social engineering as their primary weapon. The hackers that stole emails from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 2016 did so by tricking Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta into handing over the password to his Google account. Those who targeted Google in 2003 went after the company's employees over instant messaging. And ransomware attacks, an increasingly common form of scam whereby victims' computers and accounts are frozen until they pay to unlock them, almost always work by getting people to click a dodgy link. While some hackers use zero-day exploits, previously unrevealed vulnerabilities in key software, or purpose built spying tools to go after their victims, many do not use code much more sophisticated than that seen in the ILOVEYOU attack. They don't need to. \"Humans are always the weak link,\" Vatis said. \"It's almost always easier to exploit a human through some social engineering gambit than it is to crack, you know, some technological defensive measure.\" One thing that has changed somewhat since ILOVEYOU is how prepared most companies are for such an incident. Most at least have some kind of anti-virus protection, and back up their data. But all the experts who tackled ILOVEYOU two decades ago agreed that there remains a startling degree of complacency over potentially devastating cyber attacks. \"What's frightening is that 20 years after, there are still plenty of organizations who don't take this seriously until they are hit,\" said Gazeley, the Hong Kong cybersecurity expert. \"So many people still don't plan ahead.\" What largely prevents such an attack is that most companies and individuals outsource running email servers to those who know how to do it best \u2014 primarily Microsoft and Google \u2014 and rely on them to filter incoming messages, cut out spam and warn of potential attacks. Were a worm like ILOVEYOU to find a way past those filters, and spread fast enough to prevent the companies rolling out a patch, the possibility of it doing major damage remains. There is no reason to expect that the average user has grown any less complacent today. With email providers doing most of the work in spotting dodgy messages, they may actually be more so. Vatis said that the potential effect on online communications of such a worm could be \"devastating,\" as could the knock on the global economy as companies go offline or lose business all at once. He compared the situation to people who avoid getting vaccinated for the flu every year. \"That's not a problem for society as a whole until the vaccination rate drops below a certain percentage,\" he said. \"And then you have a lot of people getting really sick.\"",

        "content": "Ten days before New York issued a stay-at-home order, Truman Lam, 35, was already contemplating whether to close his restaurant Jing Fong, an icon in Manhattan's Chinatown. It was Tuesday, March 10. During the peak lunch hour, he went upstairs to count how many customers he still had. Jing Fong's dining room is massive; a destination for banquets and weddings, it can hold up to 794 people \u2014 and on weekends, there has historically been a long wait to get in for dim sum. But on that day, Lam counted just 36 guests.Business had started to slow as early as January and was down 80%. All of the parties in March were canceled, too, he said. \"That day, I decided, you know what? Let's just close for the rest of the weekdays,\" Lam told CNN Business, adding that he was thinking about staying open on the typically busier weekends.As long as the restaurant could cover workers' wages each day, Lam felt it was still worth it to stay open. But \"it became more and more obvious that we couldn't even cover the payroll for that day,\" Lam said. Read MoreSoon after, Lam made the final decision to furlough 170 staff members across two locations and encourage them to apply for unemployment benefits. He declined to say whether he has filed for benefits, too.Across New York, businesses like Lam's have shut down during the coronavirus pandemic and Asian American workers have filed for unemployment benefits at extraordinary rates. In the state, about 147,000 self-identified Asian workers have filed initial unemployment claims in the last four weeks alone, up from just 2,100 during the same period last year.  That's a 6,900% increase \u2014 by far the largest percentage increase experienced by any one racial or ethnic group.  In contrast, claims were up 1,840% for white workers, 1,260% for black workers, and 2,100% for Hispanic and Latino workers in New York. Truman Lam, manager of Jing Fong Restaurant in Manhattan's Chinatown, pictured in February. (Jorge Corona / New York University)New York stands out from other states in that in early April, it started releasing detailed demographic breakdowns of unemployment claimants every week. Not surprisingly, claims are skyrocketing for every group in the state, reflecting the sharp economic downturn that nationwide has left 30 million Americans filing first-time unemployment claims since mid-March.But even so, the increase for Asian Americans is an oddity: It's so large, it's disproportionate to the size of their labor force. Asian workers make up about 9% of New York state's population and work force, but now account for 12.5% of initial claims over the last four weeks. A year ago, they made up just 3.7% of claims during the same time period. For the other groups, claims are either roughly in line \u2014 or well below \u2014 the size of their populations. White workers, for example, make up 65% of New York's labor force, but only 51% of recent claims.\n\nWhat's the cause? Academics and members of the community point to several potential factors ranging from xenophobia to Asian Americans working in industries hard hit by the pandemic, including food and services. Many Asian workers also say they began social distancing earlier in the crisis than others \u2014 a factor that led some to close down businesses even before official lockdowns. Lam, for instance, believes the main reason his restaurant began to lose business starting in January is because of \"Chinese people practicing social distancing early.\" One regular customer told him that their parents hadn't left the house in a month since January except to get coffee and the newspaper.\"Jing Fong was first established around 1978,\" said Lam, who took over daily operations of the business after his father, uncle and grandfather. \"And we've never seen anything like this before.\"Jing Fong's massive dining room, shown here a year ago, is usually bustling with customers, but after business slowed, it closed in mid March. (Jing Fong Restaurant)Low unemployment rates never told the full story For much of the last ten years, Asian workers have had the lowest unemployment rate and highest median household income of any racial or ethnic group in the US. Part of the reason is due to their higher education levels. All of those figures contribute to the common perception that Asian Americans are more economically successful than average and to the pernicious model minority myth about Asian Americans being polite, working hard and pulling themselves up by their bootstraps.But studies have shown low unemployment rates and high household earnings obscure persistent disadvantages for Asian Americans, including workplace discrimination and increasing income inequality within the group.We've never seen anything like this before.\"Truman Lam, manager of Jing Fong RestaurantAverages also hide the fact that Asian Americans \u2014 one of the fastest growing populations in the US \u2014 are a diverse population. Those who self-identify as Chinese, Indian or Filipino ancestry make up the three largest Asian groups in the US, but no one ethnicity makes up a majority. The same is true of Asian Americans in New York State, where smaller populations of Burmese, Bangladeshis and Pakistanis are also growing quickly.Economically, Asian Americans are the most divided racial or ethnic group in the US, a Pew Research study found, with high-income Asian Americans in the 90th percentile earning 10.7 times as much as Asian Americans in the 10th percentile. All of those underlying factors are at play now in New York's data, as unemployment claims spike disproportionately for the Asian community. Low-wage workers hit first One theory from experts to explain the high unemployment claims is that many Asian Americans work in industries that were hardest hit by lockdowns \u2014 places like restaurants, small shops and nail salons.  While overall, Asian Americans are more likely to work in education and health services than retail and restaurants, those who were hardest hit by layoffs and furloughs early in the pandemic probably were in low-wage service sectors. Wellington Z. Chen, executive director of the Chinatown Partnership, a nonprofit that focuses on revitalizing the neighborhood, said that Asian communities' reliance on industries like food services and personal care meant they bore the brunt of shelter-in-place orders. \"You can't cut nails from six feet away, right?\" said Chen. \"A lot of people are not going to hang on. [They're] not going to make it.\" Nationwide, Asian workers make up about 6% of the US labor force, but 57% of 449,000 \"miscellaneous personal appearance workers,\" a category that mainly includes nail salons. You can't cut nails from six feet away, right?\"Wellington Z. Chen, executive director of the Chinatown PartnershipOn the opposite end of the income-spectrum, however, they also represent 35% of software developers, 20% of physicians and surgeons, and 23% of pharmacists. Those white collar jobs are generally more resilient to layoffs \u2014but economists expect those sectors could be hit later in the pandemic as well.But occupations alone likely don't explain the disproportionate rise in Asian unemployment claims as other groups work in hard-hit industries too. That's why experts also point to other potential explanations. Racism and xenophobia as a factor Business owners and workers told CNN Business that recently, racism and xenophobia against Chinese and Chinese-looking people have been a factor in driving business closures and unemployment claims. In some of New York City's predominantly Asian neighborhoods, business owners told CNN Business that foot traffic took a downturn months before lockdowns were in place. Not only that, but Asian employees and business owners said they were also apprehensive about commuting to work, as people would give them strange looks and news about anti-Asian hate crimes was spreading across their social media networks. Lin Weng, 25, who lives in Sunset Park, a neighborhood known as Brooklyn's Chinatown, applied for unemployment benefits after she was furloughed from her coffee shop on March 22. But while customers were still coming into the shop, she said, she experienced an incident in which she was associated with the coronavirus potentially due to her race.  \"This lady walked in... and the first thing she asked me was 'do you guys have the coronavirus?'\" said Weng, who added that the woman proceeded to order an iced coffee but then changed her mind and left. \"And I'm just [thinking] like, 'are you asking me or telling me?'\" Lin Weng poses in her home in April. She applied for unemployment benefits after being furloughed from her job at a coffee shop. (Lin Weng)Reports of attacks against Asians and those appearing to be East Asian have intensified after the coronavirus outbreak began in China in January. The NYPD Hate Crimes Task Force told CNN Business that of the 14 coronavirus-related hate crimes it investigated since the start of the outbreak, all of the victims were of Asian descent.Jennifer Lee, a sociology professor at Columbia University, said that President Donald Trump's reference to the coronavirus as a \"Chinese virus\" exacerbated fears among Asian Americans, by playing into xenophobia. \"While he no longer refers to coronavirus as the 'Chinese virus,'\" the damage has already been done,\" she wrote in an email.In addition to racism and xenophobia, Asian businesses in neighborhoods like Chinatown and Flushing have faced caution from their own communities as well. Some Asian customers have drastically cut back their interactions with Asian-run businesses, as owners noticed huge drops in traffic. Early social distancing hurt Chinese businesses Some essential businesses, including Asian-run supermarkets in Flushing and laundromats in Brooklyn, have closed despite being allowed to operate under shelter-in-place rules. The Korean American Dry Cleaners Association of New York estimates that 70% of its 1,500 members will soon or already have temporarily closed their operations, according to Ahyoung Kim, small business project manager at the nonprofit Asian American Federation. Reasons varied from workers being unwilling to come in, to some contracting the virus, or because business had dropped off. Some Chinese American workers who have applied for unemployment told CNN Business they agreed with their bosses' decision to close, even if it meant that they lost income.  Zixian Tang, 25, who lives in Flushing, Queens, worked at a popular karaoke place that closed on March 15.  Even if his boss had not chosen to close the place, Tang said in comments translated by CNN Business from Mandarin Chinese, \"I'm not willing to go to work because I'm afraid\" despite having rent to pay. \"The death toll is too high,\" he said.Jennifer Feng, 38, a nail technician at an ordinarily bustling mall salon in Flushing told CNN Business in comments translated from Mandarin that the salon decided to cancel its many upcoming appointments and close on March 16, several days ahead of New York's stay-at-home order. While she can apply for unemployment, she said she is waiting for her stimulus check to hit first to see if she needs the extra benefits.Jennifer Feng, 38, a nail technician at a mall salon in Flushing, takes a photo at home on April 30, 2020. (Jennifer Feng)Feng said she believes Flushing stores closed early because the Chinese American community acted faster in taking precautions, from social distancing early to wearing face masks, compared to those in other groups.Economists from Columbia University, New York University, and the University of Massachusetts Boston said they can't know for sure whether xenophobia or caution were reasons for the high amount of unemployment claims from Asian Americans. It's too early, and data on that is unavailable so far. A different story for South Asian communities While workers of East Asian backgrounds say they grappled with shop closures, social distancing and xenophobia early on in the pandemic, South Asian neighborhoods in Queens were still pretty crowded at the end of March.  \"I went to Patel Brothers the first week of the shutdown,\" said Annetta Seecharran, executive director of the Chhaya Community Development Corporation, a nonprofit that serves the South Asian community, referring to a destination Indian grocery store in Jackson Heights, Queens. \"It was life as usual, like nobody had actually heard of any pandemic.\" Mohammed Uddin, 42, told CNN Business that although the virus' first case in New York was announced on March 2, only when the death toll began to rise in mid-March did he begin to realize it was a dangerous situation. If I got any other job, which is not close to people, of course I'll go to work.\"Mohammed Uddin, former Access-a-Ride driverCompared to stores in Flushing, the ones in Jackson Heights \u2014 a diverse neighborhood known for Indian, Bangladeshi and Latino American residents as well as other groups \u2014 stayed open longer, Uddin observed. But despite different reaction times \u2014 and, anecdotally, fewer coronavirus-related hate crimes against them, South Asians are also reporting a sudden uptick in unemployment claims, according to Seecharran.Uddin said he left his job as an Access-a-Ride driver on March 17 because it involves chauffeuring elderly and ill patients from their homes to hospitals and he felt it was too risky. His friends, drivers who introduced him to the job, quit too, he said. Mohammed Uddin was a used car salesman, then a driver for Access-a-Ride, but is now unemployed. (Mohammed Uddin)\"I was very scared of getting anything,\" he said. He developed a cough and fever that worried him. He lives with his wife, a 2-year-old, a 7-year-old and his mom, 67, and dad, 75, both of whom have diabetes.  \"If I got any other job, which is not close to people, of course I'll go to work,\" he said.Small numbers in 2019 meant a large spike for 2020 Another factor behind the large jump: Asian Americans filed very few claims last year, so that's partly why their percentage gains were higher than any other group, said Christian Moser, assistant professor of economics at Columbia Business School. \"The larger number... will come from the fact that we've started out with such a low level to begin with for Asian Americans,\" he said.  The small base numbers in 2019 can be potentially explained in part by pride, said Ahyoung Kim, the small business project manager. And now, it's possible Asian American people are rethinking that stance given the combination of racism and economic fallout they've experienced during the pandemic. \"I can't speak for all Asian cultures, but at least in the Korean community, there has been a bit of shaming, in a cultural sense that you can't really demand stuff from the government,\" she said. \"There's a huge shift in the community. Those that are asking are now realizing, 'I can take this money and we should take this money because there really is no choice.'\" Undocumented immigrants missing from the numbers Even as unemployment claims have surged, the number almost surely undercounts the total of Asian Americans who are unemployed during the pandemic, as undocumented immigrants are ineligible to apply. About 238,000 undocumented Asian immigrants live in New York state, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. There's no data on how many of them have lost jobs recently. Sora Lee, 23, who lives in Bayside, Queens, told CNN Business that her whole family is ineligible. Both her parents are undocumented, while she and her sister worked jobs that were paid in cash. All four of them lost jobs recently, although her dad is unemployed due to an injury unrelated to coronavirus.Sora Lee was paid in cash and isn't eligible for unemployment benefits. Neither are her parents, who are undocumented immigrants. (Sora Lee)Her mom, who requested to remain anonymous because of her immigration status, is a nail technician who lost her job after her salon closed. \"I would like to be working because of the money, but at the same time, it's very dangerous because of the virus, so it was a good idea to close down,\" she said in comments translated from Korean by her daughter.  Thanks to a babysitting gig, Lee does have some income right now, but she's the only one in the family who does and her mother said she's worried she won't be able to pay her bills. Rent, electricity, cable, internet, car insurance and life insurance payments due soon total up to $2,600 and the family is leaning on credit cards and about $1,000 left in savings. She said she wished that undocumented immigrants could be eligible for some sort of relief. The long road ahead The financial impact on Asian Americans may change how these neighborhoods look once the pandemic ends. During the 2008 recession, Asian Americans had the highest long-term unemployment of any group, according to a 2012 study from Marlene Kim, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts Boston.\"I'm going to predict that this is going to happen again,\" Kim told CNN Business. \"I think it was part discrimination but also part other people dropped out of the labor market, they didn't even look for jobs. But Asians kept looking for jobs and being counted [as unemployed.]\" Economists predict that nationwide, unemployment could surge to around 20% by June \u2014 a level not seen since the 1930s Great Depression.New York's skyrocketing unemployment numbers could be just the beginning. And with many working in sectors hard hit by coronavirus and potentially facing discrimination, it could be difficult for Asian Americans to find jobs once New York opens back up again.Wilson Tang, 41, owner of Nom Wah Tea Parlor \u2014 a dim sum restaurant that first opened in 1920 \u2014 said almost all of Manhattan's Chinatown has shut down. He has furloughed about 55 employees in Chinatown and is keeping a location north of Little Italy open only for takeout and delivery. \"I have told the people that we laid off to please go exercise that right and use the unemployment benefits that they've paid towards and the company has paid towards and whatever stimulus checks or whatever resources they can to survive and weather this storm,\" he said.Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the number of Jing Fong employees who were furloughed.",

        "content": "Maatje Benassi, a US Army reservist and mother of two, has become the target of conspiracy theorists who falsely place her at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, saying she brought the disease to China. The false claims are spreading across YouTube every day, so far racking up hundreds of thousands of apparent views, and have been embraced by Chinese Communist Party media. Despite never having tested positive for the coronavirus or experienced symptoms, Benassi and her husband are now subjects of discussion on Chinese social media about the outbreak, including among accounts that are known drivers of large-scale coordinated activities by their followers. The claims have turned their lives upside down. The couple say their home address has been posted online and that, before they shut down their accounts, their social media inboxes were overrun with messages from believers of the conspiracy.   \"It's like waking up from a bad dream going into a nightmare day after day,\" Maatje Benassi told CNN Business in an exclusive interview, the first time she has spoken publicly since being smeared online. Maatje Benassi at her home on Wednesday, April 22. She said the experience is \"like waking up from a bad dream going into a nightmare day after day.\" (Heather Fulbright / CNN)As the coronavirus has spread around the world, so has misinformation about the disease. Technology giants have touted the steps they are taking to combat coronavirus misinformation, but these efforts have failed to help the Benassis. The family's suffering highlights the potential for blatant falsehoods to be rewarded and amplified by social media platforms. It also serves as a powerful reminder that misinformation online, however wild or obviously untrue it may seem, can have real and lasting consequences offline.  Read MoreMaajte and her husband Matt are still active in their government jobs. Maajte is a civilian employee at the US Army's Fort Belvoir in Virginia where she works as a security officer. Matt, a retired Air Force officer, is a civilian employee with the Air Force at the Pentagon. Despite working for the US government, the couple are experiencing the same feelings of helplessness familiar to others who have been the target of harassment and misinformation. \"I want everybody to stop harassing me, because this is cyberbullying to me and it's gone way out of hand,\" Maajte said while fighting back tears.  Matt has tried to get the videos taken down from YouTube and to prevent their spread online. The couple said they contacted an attorney, who told them there was little that could be done, and local police, who told them much the same. Origins of a coronavirus conspiracy theory  Conspiracy theories are not dissimilar to viruses, in that they evolve and mutate to spread and survive. Before Maatje Benassi became the main protagonist in this conspiracy, variations had circulated online for months.  In the early weeks of the coronavirus, conspiracy theorists began claiming, without evidence, that it was a US biological weapon. Later one member of the Chinese government publicly promoted the notion that the US military brought the virus to China. US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said it was \"completely ridiculous and it's irresponsible\" for someone speaking on behalf of the Chinese government to promote such a claim.   It wasn't until March, months after the first reported coronavirus cases in China, that conspiracy theorists turned their focus to Maatje Benassi. The baseless theory began with her participation in October in the Military World Games, essentially the military Olympics, which was hosted by Wuhan, the Chinese city where the coronavirus outbreak began last year. Maatje Benassi competed in the cycling competition there, suffering an accident on the final lap that left her with a fractured rib and a concussion. Despite the crash, Benassi still finished the race, but it turned out to be the start of something worse. While hundreds of athletes from the US military took part in the games, Maatje Benassi was plucked out of the group and given a starring role in the conspiracy theory.  A letter that Maatje Benassi received in the mail from an unknown sender. Her family's address was posted online after she became the target of conspiracy theorists. (Heather Fulbright / CNN)Perhaps the most prominent cheerleader of the idea that Benassi had a role in the imaginary plot to infect the world is George Webb, a prolific 59-year-old American misinformation peddler. Webb has for years regularly streamed hours of diatribe live on YouTube, where he has amassed more than 27 million views and almost 100,000 followers.  In 2017, CNN revealed how Webb was part of a trio of conspiracy theorists that pushed a false rumor about a cargo ship with a \"dirty bomb\" that was set to arrive at the Port of Charleston in South Carolina. The bomb never materialized, but the claims did lead to parts of the port -- one of the biggest in America -- being shut down for a time as a safety precaution.  Until recently, Webb said, his YouTube videos included advertisements -- meaning the platform, which is owned by Google, was making money from Webb's misinformation, as was Webb himself. Webb even claimed that the Italian DJ Benny Benassi, whose 2002 song \"Satisfaction\" became a worldwide sensation, had the coronavirus and that he, along with Maatje and Matt Benassi, were part of a Benassi plot connected to the virus. (Benny told CNN Business he has never met Maatje and Matt, and they said that as far as they know, they are not related. Benny pointed out that Benassi is a very common last name in Italy.)  Benny Benassi told CNN Business he has not been diagnosed with the coronavirus. Like artists around the world, he canceled his concerts because of social distancing and travel restrictions. (Webb previously claimed the DJ is Dutch, he is not.) In a phone interview with CNN Business on Thursday, which he livestreamed to his followers on YouTube, Webb offered no substantive evidence to support his claims about the Benassis and said he considered himself an \"investigative reporter,\" not a conspiracy theorist.  He also said that YouTube recently stopped running ads on his videos after he began talking about the coronavirus. Webb said he had normally made a few hundred dollars a month directly from YouTube.  YouTube confirmed to CNN that it was not currently running ads on Webb's channel, but it declined to say whether ads appeared there in the past or provide details on how much money his channel may have made. A company spokesperson said YouTube was committed to promoting accurate information about the coronavirus. The company removed some threatening comments about the Benassis that had been posted under Webb's videos when asked about them by CNN Business. YouTube also said it had removed some videos posted by Webb in the past.False theories online spark real world concerns While the allegations about the Benassis may be wildly untrue, the threats they face and the fear they feel are very real.  Matt Benassi said he fears this could \"turn into another Pizzagate,\" referencing another baseless conspiracy theory that claimed a pedophilia ring that somehow involved Hillary Clinton, among others, was operating out of a Washington DC pizzeria. The fringe theory didn't receive much mainstream attention until a man showed up at the pizzeria in late 2016 and fired an assault weapon, saying he was there to investigate \"Pizzagate.\"  Maatje's husband Matt says the family are afraid for their lives. (Heather Fulbright / CNN)\"It's really hard to hold him [Webb] accountable,\" Matt Benassi said. \"Law enforcement will tell you that there's nothing that we can do about it because we have free speech in this country. Then they say, 'Go talk to a civil attorney,' so we did. We talked to an attorney. You quickly realize that for folks like us, it's just too expensive to litigate something like this. We get no recourse from law enforcement. We get no recourse from the courts.\" Matt Benassi said he has complained to YouTube but even when the company does take videos down it can take days for it to do so. By that time, a video can go viral, and the damage is done. Worse still: videos Webb has posted to YouTube that are removed are often re-uploaded to the platform.  In China, the YouTube videos attacking the Benassis are uploaded to popular platforms there such as WeChat, Weibo, and Xigua Video and are translated into Chinese, according to an analysis by Keenan Chen, a researcher at First Draft, a non-profit that researches disinformation. Matt and Maatje Benassi both work for the US Military. (Heather Fulbright / CNN)The Benassis' experience is unfortunately not unique, said Danielle Citron, a professor of law at Boston University School of Law and a MacArthur Fellow who studies online harassment. Faced with \"cyber mobs,\" as Citron describes them, law enforcement often can't or won't investigate.  As for the likes of YouTube, Citron said the law has to change: \"Right now, they're totally immune from legal liability under federal law. And so they can just walk away.\" Whatever happens next, \"the damage is done,\" according to Maatje Benassi.  \"I know it [will] never be the same. Every time you're going to Google my name, it will pop up as patient zero.\"",

        "content": "Kent, England (CNN Business)The British government wants you: To cut lettuce from the fields, pick berries from the bushes and load boxes of fresh produce into cold storage warehouses.While many people hunker down at home, reloading the internet sites of grocery stores to secure a home delivery slot or dreading the socially distanced, masked visit to a supermarket, it's easy to lose sight of the supply chain and where that food is coming from.As Covid-19 cases surpass 180,000 in the United Kingdom, British farmers are facing spring cut off from the Eastern European migrant workers that make the harvest possible. But with thousands of Brits laid off or furloughed, the UK government now says its official policy is to try to get locals onto the fields.       \"We estimate that probably only about a third of the migrant labor that would normally come to the UK is here,\" George Eustice, the environment secretary and top British official on farming, said at press conference on Sunday. The government would work with farms to \"encourage those millions of furloughed workers to in some cases consider taking a second job, helping get the harvest in in June.\"Back to basics. The \"blitz spirit.\" A nationwide effort to bind together wounds, not far off from the World War II campaign that carried the nation through the relentless German bombing campaign of 1940 and 1941.Read MoreBack breaking workAt the crack of dawn on a farm in Kent, southeast England on Monday, a group of six women are dressed in an idiosyncratic mix of T-shirts and down jackets. Bent double at the waist, they cut lettuce after lettuce from the earth, trimming leaves and then packing them onto pallets. Farm director Nick Ottewell, affable and full of nervous energy, looks on.Farming is complex enough in a normal year, he says. The pandemic has stranded his workforce and eliminated buyers like McDonald's (MCD), which used to use his Apollo lettuce in its chicken wraps, when it still sold them.Managing it all is \"virtually impossible.\" He doubts the farm will even break even this year.       The Betts family own the farm here, land they've been tilling since the early 1900s. Ottewell reckons they're about 45 people short, and the clock is ticking. In two weeks, they have to harvest their most important crop: iceberg lettuce.And yet without any advertising, the farm has gotten 50 unsolicited inquiries from locals seeking work, through word of mouth and stories in the Kent press.Ottewell chose eight to come in for training. So on the last sunny day in a run of unusually fair English spring weather, a mix of young and old, male and female, gathered in an open-air conference room for a socially distanced induction.'An honorable thing to do'Daniel Martin, 32, sits in a kitchenette across from a female trainer with a laptop.Until recently, he was a civil engineer, playing a crucial role in the British construction industry. Then came coronavirus, and he was furloughed.Daniel Martin, 32, was furloughed from his civil engineering job.\"With construction sites closed, a lot of the clients have ceased work,\" he explains. \"So it dried up for us.\"His friend worked on the farm, and Martin figured driving a forklift would be better than sitting on his couch all summer.\"I just wanted to be active, to get involved. Keep me fit, get me out of the house, otherwise we're locked down at home. I enjoy being outside.\"Getting out and about: A running theme.Nick Ottewell talks with Sally Penfold, 45, who says providing the nation with food is \"an honorable thing to do.\"\"I was fed up with being indoors, not earning any money,\" said Sally Penfold, 45. \"I just wanted to get out there and do some kind of work. I think providing food for the nation is quite an honorable thing to do.\"She lost her waitress job at a restaurant in Hastings, after the UK government lockdown took effect at the end of March.\"I got a job in an Italian restaurant. And I worked there for about six weeks. And then the restaurant got closed down.\"She heard about the farm through a story on local radio, while staying with a friend, and decided that tending the land would be better than being \"stuck at home for weeks on end.\"Thomas Tanswell, 32, was laid off from his restaurant job. \"I needed to re-enter the world.\"Thomas Tanswell, 32, can relate.He too lost his job, as a chef, to coronavirus.\"I decided basically I need to start getting active again,\" he explained. \"I could feel my mind maybe going a little bit. I decided I needed to reenter the world -- maybe take lemons to make lemonade, I guess.\"A love of the outdoors and a fear of idle hands made farm work an obvious option, Tanswell said.\"It just fits like a glove for me. Especially this time of year. So it might be something I'd be interested in long-term as well, to be honest. It seems like such a nice place and nice atmosphere.\"'Commit to us'The enthusiasm was genuine, and yet Ottewell looked on with nervous hesitation.Among his chief concerns is that the new recruits won't last, perhaps because they can't handle the hard work, get bored or go back to their old jobs. That could be disastrous, abandoning him and his crops mid-season.The Alliance of Ethical Labour Providers, which helps provide farms with laborers, said that about 55,000 people have expressed interest in farm jobs. How many actually went on to accept a position? Just under 150, as of April 24, the alliance says.Ottewell would love to have a bevy of Brits fill the 45 positions he has to fill before the all-important iceberg harvest. But he isn't hopeful.       \"I've been working this industry my whole adult career, which is around 25 years now as a manager, and all of my experience tells me that that just isn't going to be the case,\" Ottewell said. He chafes at coverage in Britain's tabloid media. When a large lettuce grower in East Anglia chartered a plane to fly seasonal workers from Romania in mid-April, The Sun wrote that a UK company was paying for immigrants \"to show Brits how it's done.\"\"It's seasonal work,\" Ottewell says. \"And British people haven't wanted to do seasonal work, for whatever reason.\"\"Companies like ours have relied on migrant workers for decades to have businesses. However, we're here. And you're welcome to come. But come and commit to us for the summer.\"CNN's Matt Brealey, Lewis Whyld, and Mark Baron contributed to this report.",

        "content": "London (CNN Business)Volkswagen reopened the world's biggest car factory at Wolfsburg in Germany on Monday after the coronavirus forced it to shut down for the longest period in its 82-year history. The world's largest carmaker has made 100 changes to the way its plants operate as it tries to restart business without risking the health of hundreds of thousands of workers. Its experience underscores the daunting task ahead for manufacturers as they resume work in a world still reeling from the pandemic.\"We have never developed, produced and sold vehicles under these conditions before,\" said Bernd Osterloh, the top labor representative at Volkswagen (VLKAF).Automakers plan to restart factories in early May. UAW says not so fastThe gigantic Wolfsburg plant is located on the banks of an equally impressive feat of human engineering, the 200-mile long Mittelland Canal connecting sea and inland ports in Europe. Originally built in 1938 to house workers for Volkswagen's factories, Wolfsburg is still home to the group's headquarters and has produced more than 45 million cars since 1945. It's where the iconic Beetle was produced for more than three decades and where the automaker's bestselling models, the VW Golf series and the Tiguan, are made today. Read MoreThe plant shut on March 19 as the novel coronavirus tore through Europe, prompting carmakers to halt production across the continent after borders were closed and national lockdowns imposed. Its reopening is symbolic of wider efforts to kickstart economies in Europe, where some 14 million people work in jobs connected to the automobile sector.The sprawling factory complex covers 6.5 million square meters (70 million square feet). It churned out about 700,000 cars last year, or roughly 3,500 a day. Some 63,000 people work on the site, about half the residents of the city after which it is named.\n\nReopening Wolfsburg has been anything but straightforward. The plant depends on a supply chain spanning 71 countries and more than 2,600 companies, all dealing with the fallout of the coronavirus. Volkswagen has put in place 100 different health and safety measures, agreed with its workers, with information displayed on more than 8,000 posters at the plant, and explained in booklets.\"Volkswagen is setting a standard for German industry with this agreement,\" said Osterloh.What's changing at WolfsburgThe company plans to ramp up production slowly, in line with the availability of parts, government requirements and the demand for cars, which collapsed as the coronavirus spread. It expects to build 1,400 cars at Wolfsburg this week, rising to 6,000 next week, or about 40% of output prior to the pandemic.\"At Volkswagen, health takes precedence over speed,\" Thomas Ulbrich, head of e-mobility for the Volkswagen brand, said in a statement last week when the company reopened its electric vehicle plant in Zwickau, Germany.Volkswagen's gigantic factory complex in Wolfsburg, Germany.Wolfsburg will restart with one shift of 8,000 production line workers instead of the usual 20,000. Hours will initially be reduced for some employees, with shift changes arranged so that workers arriving don't meet those that are leaving. Workers will be expected to check their own temperature and change into their uniforms at home each morning, rather than on site. They will be asked to use elbows to open doors and walk in single file once inside, following markers on the floor to keep space between people. Social distancing will be enforced during team meetings and over lunch breaks, with reduced seating in common areas and conference rooms converted into office spaces. Canteens will remain closed and workers asked to bring their own lunch. Water dispensers have been temporarily removed to reduce the likelihood of infection and air conditioners set to circulate as much fresh air as possible.Tools will be disinfected after every shift and workers will no longer pass them to one another by hand, instead setting materials down in containers so that others can pick them up at a safe distance. Several hundred additional hand washing facilities are being installed throughout the plant. Employees walk towards an entrance gate at the Volkswagen plant in Wolfsburg, Germany, on April 27, 2020. Vehicles will be spaced further apart on the factory floor and workers will complete tasks on the same car separately where possible. Masks will be worn where it is not possible to keep 1.5 meters (5 feet) apart.Another huge challenge for Volkswagen and other manufacturers will be ensuring that the armies of suppliers entering their factories do not increase the risk of infection. Volkswagen, which also owns the Audi, Porsche and Seat brands, said it has shared its 100-point safety plan with more than 40,000 suppliers and logistics partners throughout the world.\n\nBefore the pandemic, 2,000 trucks would ferry some 21,000 raw materials and vehicle components to the Wolfsburg plant each day. Now, drivers will be required to remain in their vehicles at all times and the machinery used to unload the trucks will be cleaned more frequently during shifts.\"We have been in close contact with our suppliers throughout the whole period of the corona crisis, throughout the shutdown and when we reopened plants, making sure they will be able to deliver the parts we need,\" a VW spokesperson said.The opening of plants in Zwickau and Bratislava, Slovakia last week went off smoothly \"so we're optimistic that we'll handle this in the appropriate way at Wolfsburg,\" the spokesperson added. Volkswagen's experience in China, where it has already reopened 32 of its 33 plants, offers a blueprint. \"There was not a single part missing when we started to produce.\"The company resumed production at plants making components across Germany from April 6, including in Brunswick and Kassel, and in Poland from April 14, to safeguard the supply of parts to its factories in China.Volkswagen workers at a component plant in Kassel, which resumed production on April 6.Volkswagen's production in China has reached 60% to 70% of its pre-coronavirus levels. Plants there have been open for well over a month, suggesting that a return to anything close to full production in Europe is still several weeks away. But carmakers have plenty of time to get this right, given demand for their products has also evaporated.Tough times aheadCar sales in China, the world's biggest car market, declined 42% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period last year, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Sales in the United States and Europe have plunged too.Demand in China could bounce back quite quickly, but car sales in Europe will take at least 10 years to return to 2019 levels, according to Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, founder of the Center Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen.Volkswagen and other German carmakers, BMW (BMWYY) and Daimler's (DMLRY) Mercedes-Benz, will fare far better than rivals such as Renault (RNLSY) and Citro\u00ebn because of their heavier exposure to China's recovery, he added.  Still, the institute expects Germany's automobile manufacturing sector to cut 100,000 jobs over the next three to four years, about 12% of the total, as a prolonged demand slump forces production cuts.",

        "content": "Hong Kong/Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN Business)When Fatema Akther arrived for work at the Alif Casual Wear garment factory in Dhaka in late March, she had no idea it would be her last day.\"My line chief came and told me that I didn't have to work anymore,\" said Akther, 25, who had been employed there for five years. She said the company, which could not be reached for comment, decided to close the factory, leaving her without a source of income past March.Coronavirus: Latest news on the Covid-19 global pandemicThe coronavirus pandemic has led factories to furlough or lay off more than half of the country's nearly 4.1 million garment workers, according to estimates from the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA). Like Akther, most of them are women, and the roughly $110 they earn every month is often their families' only source of money.\"My family runs on my single income,\" said Akther, who said she provides for her husband and child. \"I don't know how my family will survive.\"Global lockdowns and unprecedented job losses have caused demand for just about anything that isn't food to evaporate, including clothing. That's led the international apparel brands and retailers who rely on the cheap labor that Bangladesh provides to cancel or suspend an estimated $3.17 billion worth of orders in the country, according to BGMEA.Read MoreThe loss of business has exposed a rift between those major brands and the factory owners they contract with. Members of Bangladesh's business community say they've been left to pick up the tab, which has put their factories and workers in dire straits.\"It's abysmal, it's unreal,\" said Rubana Huq, President of the BGMEA, adding that there is little legal recourse in the country for factories to demand that international retailers fulfill the terms of their contracts. \"I don't want any grant, I don't want any kind of charity, I just want the bare minimum justice for our workers.\"The fallout is also devastating news for the South Asian country's economy, which is disproportionately reliant on the apparel industry to keep its economy humming. Garments make up roughly 80% of Bangladesh's exports, Trading Economics says, and generated more than $30 billion last year, according to the country's Export Promotion Bureau \u2014 making it the second biggest exporter of such goods in the world after China. In total, the industry contributes 16% of Bangladesh's GDP.     Millions of jobs at riskThe millions of factory workers aren't the only ones at risk, either. Around 15 million jobs in the country are reliant on the industry, directly or indirectly, according to the Bangladesh Commerce Ministry. That includes food sellers, truck drivers and port workers.\"It's a very dangerous situation which may impact a lot of people,\" said Bangladesh Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi.Sweeping government lockdowns have also separated some workers from their families, since many travel from smaller villages to Dhaka to find work. The capital and largest city in Bangladesh, which was locked down late last month, is where most of the country's garment factories are based.\"The biggest problem right now is food, we don't know how we will eat,\" said Rezaul Islam, 26, who said he was laid off in late March from a Dhaka-based factory and is now stuck in the city. The nationwide lockdown, which has been extended until Saturday, forbids people from going out except to pick up groceries, medicine or other necessities.\"We have families in our village who are dependent on us,\" Islam said. \"Whatever we earn here we send it back home. Now my family (will) have to live without eating.\"A garments factory is seen empty during government imposed shutdown as a preventative measure against the COVID-19 coronavirus, in Dhaka on April 6, 2020.A question of ethicsIslam called on the factories to pay their staff during the crisis. Wages are already low in the industry, which means many workers don't have a lot of savings to dip into now.\"It's not fair to kick us out like this,\" Islam said. \"Either give us back our job or give us three months' salary.\"Permanent workers who are terminated after having been with a company for at least a year are entitled to some pay for at least 60 days, according to Bangladeshi labor law. Islam says he was paid for a month. The factory where he worked, Saturn Textiles Ltd., could not be reached for comment.But factory owners stress that they can't prop up their workers alone, particularly if the brands they work with aren't fulfilling the terms of their contracts. More than half of the 316 Bangladesh suppliers surveyed by Penn State University's Center for Global Workers' Rights said that most of their finished or in-process orders have been canceled since the pandemic began. The survey respondents' clients were mostly European and American brands.The survey found that more than 98% of buyers refused to contribute to the partial wages of furloughed workers that the law requires. The buyers are contractually obliged to cover the total costs of the goods they ordered, including 16% for paying salaries, BGMEA says. The factories have to buy the raw materials and pay staffing and overheads before they are paid by the brands and retailers, Rubana Huq says, meaning all the business risk is taken on at their end.Upholding those contracts is the ethical thing to do, said David Hasanat, the chairman of Viyellatex Group, which has six factories in Dhaka.After a garment factory collapsed in the capital seven years ago and killed more than 1,000 people, there was an outcry about ethics in the industry and nearly 200 brands and more than 1,600 factories signed an agreement promoting safe working environments for workers.\"They talk about sustainability, they talk about ethics,\" Hasanat said. \"So this is the time to showcase their good words, whether they really believe [in] these ethics.\"       A closed down garments factory in Dhaka, Bangladesh. (Credit: Viyellatex Group)The role of international brandsCNN Business reached out to several major international brands who do business with Bangladeshi factories for comment.Some brands, including Swedish clothing chain H&M, US supermarket giant Walmart (WMT) and UK retailer Primark, have agreed to pay in part or in full for the goods they already ordered.\"We intend to honor our commitments to products that are finished or in the production process, and we are working with suppliers on a case-by-case basis to address any exceptions and develop solutions to minimize impact,\" Walmart said in a statement. The company estimates that the \"exceptions\" amount to less than 2% of their annual apparel orders in Bangladesh.Primark, which Penn State's study named as a brand that failed to make a firm commitment, said Monday that it will now \"take all product that was both in production and finished, and planned for handover by April 17.\"US retail sales plunged 8.7% in March, deepest drop on recordBut others, including Gap (GPS), have not made any assurances, said Aruna Kashyap, senior counsel in the women's rights division of Human Rights Watch.\"These workers are really poor,\" said Kashyap, who is based in Dhaka. \"They have worked in the supply chains and the operations of these brands for months and years. And at this moment of crisis it's really important for brands and retailers to live up to their human rights responsibilities.\"Asked whether the company would pay for goods ordered from Bangladeshi factories, Gap told CNN Business that the company is \"making decisions based on the best interest of our employees, customers and partners, as well as the long-term health of our business,\" including reducing expenses after closing stores in North America and Europe.\"We are committed to working closely with our long-standing suppliers to best assess how we can work together through this crisis,\" the company said.An exterior view of fashion retailer Gap's Oxford Street store on February 11, 2016 in London.Others connected to the American retail industry, though, pointed out that the pandemic has been crippling them, too. US retail sales plunged 8.7% in March, the worst monthly decline on record.The situation has \"created a temporary liquidity crisis that is threatening to burn a permanent hole in global supply chains,\" said Steve Lamar, the President and CEO of the American Apparel & Footwear Association.\"That is why we need governments to work together and with global financial institutions to make sure there are enough financial resources to keep supply chains solvent, so they can keep workers employed during these crises,\" Lamar said. \"Common sense measures like deferring tariff payments and fully funding loan programs for retailers \u2014 now largely closed \u2014 are just two of the tools all governments should be implementing.\"A uncertain futureThe Bangladeshi government is providing some assistance. In March and April, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina announced more than $8.5 billion in stimulus measures that includes loans to help factory owners pay worker salaries.The bill for saving the world economy is $7 trillion and rising \"The Prime Minister [is] very much serious on this,\" said Munshi, the commerce minister. \"No one should die of starvation. They have to get their money, they have to live.\" Munshi said Hasina has instructed factory owners to look after their workers.Even so, factory owners said they are concerned about taking out the government loans. The money would still have to be repaid within two years \u2014 a commitment they feared making given how unclear the coronavirus pandemic remains.\"The government is doing their best,\" said Hasanat, of Viyellatex Group. \"But we are not a rich country, we don't have much foreign reserves, so I'm also worried about whether the government has the capability to support [during] this uncertainty.\"",

        "content": "Los Angeles (CNN Business)As of 2019, there were an estimated 30.7 million small businesses in the US, employing 59.9 million people, or almost half of the private sector workforce. Small businesses drive the American economy, but as the coronavirus pandemic has proven, they do so from a cliff. Many are about to fall off. Behind those numbers are the actual people who own and work at the small businesses. It's impossible to tell all of their stories, but we can tell some. So last week we talked to the owners of six small businesses on a block of Colorado Boulevard in Los Angeles about their hopes and fears right now.The block of Colorado Boulevard in Los Angeles where the businesses are located. The block and its businesses are very much unique, made up of a group of independently-owned stores in the heart of a gentrifying community in eastern Los Angeles. But you could transplant them anywhere in the country -- any town, any large city -- and the stories would be much the same. Most of the business owners on the block are women, and many are minorities, reflecting a growing trend in the US. They went into what they do with a leap of faith \u2014 and a lot of financial risk. Now they're on the brink of ruin. Money may be coming from Washington in the next few weeks; they may not make it that long. Below are their stories, as they told them. Quotes have been edited for length and clarity. Read MoreValerie Brown, owner, Eagle Rock Community Acupuncture. Open since 2009. \"I wanted to find a place where I could foresee there being foot traffic, Colorado Boulevard is great. I signed the lease in 2008. Both these financial times were and are gloomy, that's for sure. I didn't have as much at stake back then. I was moving into a situation where I thought, 'Oh, things are going to be getting better.' Now I'm in a situation where things were fine and now they're getting worse.I'm very attached to my community. When I go into Trader Joe's I know people. This business has been around for so long, we remember each other. I miss the connection. I feel for all of us shopkeepers. If I know that we're going to be back in business up and running by May, I think I have enough to get by. If it takes until June, I still think I could do it, but I'd be awfully nervous. If it doesn't look like we can go back by June, I think I'm going to have to cease this business model because it's just not going to be viable. I sure hope that that's not the situation. I hope that at some point this year, we'll all be back to eating in restaurants, going to movies, getting community acupuncture. It would be heartbreaking because of all the connections I've made. And, you know, the patients mean a lot to me, and the community means a lot to me. I do hope that California will find a way to be lenient with the small businesses and perhaps give us back some of the money that we've pre-paid in order to be in business in the year 2020. We'd need abatement on the rent. To have to pay rent, when we can't work, we'd be drowning in a lot of debt.So far from what I've heard, [the stimulus packages are] probably going to benefit big industries most. Probably hotels, airlines, things like that. Something funny I heard recently was, [what if] if the small business owners received the stimulus and Wall Street had to set up a GoFundMe account instead of it being always in reverse. I'm just not optimistic that something that would help small businesses and not give big handouts to the people who don't need it.\"Samara Caughey, owner, Purple Twig, a children's art studio. Open since 2009. \"It's always a financial risk, always a leap of faith to own your own small business. I started very small. I rented a storefront, did the minimum to get the space ready, and opened up. I hoped parents would drop their kids off to make art, and they did! Then it grew from there. When I moved there, it was me and Peek-a-boo, a children's indoor play place. In the last 10 years, Colorado Boulevard has grown into a place that the community desires. A lot of the businesses are owned by women. The community has been welcoming. They all have an identity \u2014 each storefront. All have a passion, all believe in what they're doing. This situation is very overwhelming, that's the best word I can use to describe it. We're all going through it. I don't feel like, 'oh poor me.' I'm trying to focus on creative thinking! I'm offering subscriptions for children age 5 to adults. Seems more important than ever to express yourself.I am also fortunate that much of my income comes from summer camp. As long as they register, I have income. If this goes on through summer, I will have to close. That would be such a shame. We are so important to this community in making it vital. If we have to shut down, so many would be affected. I can hold on until the end of May. Hopefully we get a handle on this situation by then.A loan will not do anything for me or most of the shops on this street. Unless we can get grant funding, that's what we need. Leave the large businesses to get the loans. It becomes more and more apparent we're on a welfare system for the rich where we give millions to the large businesses. They can afford the loans. We can't.\" Jen Yates and Alex Hartunian, owners, Studio Metamorphosis, a fitness center. Open in this location since 2017.Alex: Any small business can owner can relate. It is not easy.Jen: We just put everything together and ... I mean scrounged every single dollar, every penny to open, and we did it. Alex did all of the construction there. He literally poured in blood, sweat and tears, with his own hands.Alex: It was really abrupt. We saw the world changing around us. And I was terrified. It was scary and Jen was equally scared. And we were just like, 'How are we going to survive... we're gonna wake up the next morning and have zero income. Like, how does that work?'Jen: When you put everything into watching something grow, and then it stops suddenly, it's so painful. I was sitting on the floor, just sobbing. Seeing it empty on a day where it should have been full was just heartbreaking to me. This has been my dream, opening up a studio. It was everything, our whole lives, and it's just gut wrenching. Alex: Yeah, we're scared. Jen: Yeah, I mean, I think each day, we look at each other and [think], 'How are we going to make this work, how are we going to stay afloat?' But yeah, we're scared like everybody else in the world, because the uncertainty is the scariest part of it.Alex: If we have like hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt in three, four months, what's the point? How will we open? Will people be ready to jump right back into business? Will people still be scared? And the more time goes on, the more the financial equation becomes looming in terms of like, a huge, huge problem. ...[Debt] forgiveness is going to be probably the number one thing that's going to put people at ease and make them comply with the stay at home order. People are scared so they're doing side work. People are getting out there and maybe perpetuating this virus. People want to know that if they hang tight [that] the government [will] tell us, 'Nothing's going to happen to your credit, you're not going to lose your home, you're not going to lose your place of business, and everybody just needs to be in this together.' That's the message out there, but we need to hear that from our government.Jen: We have to take care of our staff. I mean, we're not producing income, and they're not getting paid. And it's heartbreaking because they're starting their families and some of them are getting married now and they're beginning to start a whole new chapter in their lives, and they're so scared about what all this means for them. ... Alex and I will continue to fight and do whatever we can to generate some income to stay afloat. When challenges are presented I don't back away, and I'm going to keep moving forward and fight for it.Laura Porter, owner, Bloom School of Music and Dance. Open since 2008. \"My husband and I started Bloom back in 2008. At first, it was just the two of us, teaching everything that we could teach, while holding down other jobs. Both of us have been musicians and educators for decades, and we were being sent all the kids who wanted to quit. We decided we wanted to teach music education differently. I want to build a school with teachers who have like minds, who treat every student completely individually. Let's feel and express the beat in different ways, hear the rhythmic echoes and play games and feel that joy before we tell them to sit still and listen to the adults.It's really brought all of us together and sharing. Sharing ideas, trying to figure out a better way to do something, and really feeling like we're in it together. It's not showing up between three and eight to do your thing and then you're going home. You know, everybody in the whole school is thinking about this 24-7. We're kind of approaching our business in a lot of ways like educators \u2014 How can we do this better? How can we make it more engaging? How can we bring more joy?Like most of the schools across the country, everyone's on Zoom, [somehow,] doing live streaming, to keep things going. So far, we're holding strong. It's not April 1st yet so that's when payments are due. But right now we're holding strong.It's so frightening because it's a day-by-day thing. You know, I can't even look at September because there's no history in our lifetime for this, right? For anyone, it's not just the businesses, it's all the people that have supported those businesses over the years. [Elected officials] have to listen to the average American out of work. They always talk about how important it is for everybody to spend. If they're out of work, they can't spend. They have to put themselves in other people's shoes and small businesses are a big part of that. [If] they help small businesses, it can help the people that work for them.\"Michelle Helseth, owner, Native Boutique, a clothing store. Open in this location since 2014. \"I bought my house here when my daughter was three, so 19 years ago. I always wanted to open up a shop in our neighborhood.I think this block, this is the heart of the neighborhood. You could do everything from buying wine to cheese to having breakfast and lunch. Going shopping, buying a gift, to having your kids get educated with arts and music and dance or just going to having a children's birthday party next door. We just have everything on this block, all independently owned, all individual owners, majority women-owned.The whole world is trying to process this new reality. It's so fictional. This is something we would see in a movie theater but it's happening.As far as business, it's just come to a screeching halt.And then workman comp's insurance tried to draw from my account. I have no staff, what's the point? So I have to call my workman's comp and say, 'You know I have no staff right now so there's no reason for you to deduct my account.' I just invested in all this inventory. And so I'm extended, expecting for sales pick up in March and April, to get us back where we needed to be. I wish I was able to have reserves. We just don't. We're a small business where I'm a single mom. It's not like I have a husband bringing another income or, or a partner, I don't. This is my everything here.I'm concerned about going deeper into a hole, more debt. We need financial support to help us get through this from our government. We need grants, not just loans. You know, if they're going to give us loans, [it should be] zero interest loans. Our businesses are the frontline of keeping our neighborhood safe. If we're not here, creating a pleasant, happy, beautiful environment for community for shoppers, for families, for residents ... How safe will the community be when you're having blight on your main shopping boulevard?\"Michelle Wilton, chef/owner of Four Caf\u00e9. Open since 2010.\"I definitely cycle through every emotion. I get angry, I get sad. I think what makes me the saddest is just our employees. I have this overarching sense of responsibility for their lives as well and to provide for them. So, that has been really hard for me trying to just navigate. I need to pay them, they have children.We just haven't generated enough sales to even cover the labor on some nights so myself and our other business partner ... have been working. He's been working in the front of the house and I've been doing all the cooking. We're just really waiting to see what the stimulus is, because if the stimulus comes out and says that they're going to help pay for our staff, then we want to get everybody scheduled immediately just to give them hours, of course. But right now the reality of it is if we don't make the sales we can't pay for the labor.We just added a whole grocery section of online ordering where people can buy toilet paper, they can buy a dozen organic eggs, organic milk, any of our cookie dough, or organic bread... they can pull up curbside and pop their trunk and we put it in and it's a complete, no-contact way of shopping.I put sourdough bread kits on our site, we started pizza kits, hopefully it will generate more business so that we can employ more staff. I had to reinvent the whole thing. Anything I can to help generate business and help employ our staff, that's my number one thing, we have staff that have kids and I just get so worried about them.I have two small children, a four-year-old and an eight-year-old, and it has been tricky trying to succeed at all things. Because now I'm a homeschooling mom, so I do that in the morning and then I go to work ... and I'll go and bake or prepare. My husband will take over with the kids behind me, but we haven't taken them out. My son has asthma so it is a little scary.\"-- CNN's Kimberly Berryman contributed reporting.",

        "content": "(CNN)US automakers have come to the rescue when the nation has faced supply shortages during wartime in the past. Ford built heavy bomber airplanes and GM built amphibious assault craft, among other things. So it seems only natural that, in the rush to address the critical shortage of ventilators in the US due to the coronavirus pandemic, automakers would again be among the first to answer the call to help.So far Ford, GM, Toyota and Tesla, which have all temporarily shut down their factories in recent weeks, have pledged to help.On Friday, President Donald Trump announced he was invoking the Defense Production Act to require GM to \"accept, perform, and prioritize\" federal contracts for ventilators. That should help expedite things. But switching from cars to ventilators is not so easy. Ventilators are complex machines that use sophisticated software and specialized parts, and companies that seek to manufacture them face several hurdles \u2014 including intellectual property rights, the need for specially trained workers, regulatory approvals and safety considerations. Ford is working with 3M and GE to make respirators and ventilatorsSo far, automakers have announced they've been teaming up with existing ventilator makers to help them ramp up production. And some, like Ford (F),  and GM (GM), are exploring producing ventilators in their own factories.Read MoreBut it's a race against time. Already, sick patients are overwhelming hospitals in New York. The state fears it is headed for a situation like the one that played out in Italy, where ventilator shortages forced doctors to choose which patients get to use the potentially lifesaving machines.\"The number of ventilators we need is so astronomical,\" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Thursday, adding that hospitals have resorted to using experimental solutions, such as putting two patients on one machine.There are about 160,000 ventilators available in America but as many as 740,000 could be needed, according to the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.Ventilators can help some of the most seriously ill COVID-19 patients who start losing the ability to breathe on their own. The devices offer gentle breathing assistance so a person's lungs can rest while they fight the virus.The best way automakers can help fastNot all ventilators are exactly alike. Some are more complex than others. The sickest COVID-19 patients' lungs can stiffen, requiring high-end machines that cost up to $50,000. Those machines can be precisely tailored for patients and must be operated by trained medical professionals. Production and assembly of these high-end devices are best left to traditional ventilator manufacturers, according to Vafa Jamali, a vice president at Medtronic, which is one of only a handful of companies that manufacture ventilators. Key components are made in-house by experienced workers. Medtronic said. Not only does it not want to outsource that production, but auto makers aren't capable of making these high-end machines \u2014 at least not quickly.\"Because this is a lifesaving device, it can't be off. Practice and experience making the parts is really, really critical,\" Jamali said. One of Medtronic's premium ventilator machines. Some of its components are highly specialized, and, the company says, require trained in-house workers.On its own, Medtronic said it has already boosted its weekly ventilator production by 40% since January, in part by putting its assembly lines on a 24-hour schedule. And the company plans to ramp up production by another 200% over the next several weeks by doubling the workers on existing production lines. Its goal is to ramp up output of top-of-the-line ventilators to 500 per week, a five-fold increase.Still, the company will only be able to manufacture ventilators by the hundreds \u2014 and doctors need them by the thousands.That's why the company says it is welcoming ideas from automakers to help fill the gap.Medtronic has spoken with Tesla, GM and Ford, though the companies don't have any formal plans to work together yet, Medtronic told CNN Business.General Motors (GM) said last Friday that it was working with another ventilator maker, Ventec Life Systems, to help increase Ventec's production. The companies are ramping up to produce as many as 10,000 units a month or more, they said in a later announcement. Some of the ventilators will be built in GM's Kokomo, Indiana, electronics assembly plant. The first of these ventilators are expected to be delivered in April, the companies said.'Desperate' shortage of ventilators for coronavirus patients puts manufacturers on wartime footingThe New York Times reported late Thursday that the White House was about to announce the venture between GM and Ventec, which the report said would allow for the production of as many as 80,000 ventilators. But the Federal Emergency Management Agency said it needed more time to assess whether the venture was too costly.GM responded to the report in a statement, saying \"efforts to set up manufacturing capacity at the GM Kokomo facility are already underway to produce Ventec's critical care ventilator.\" It also said it had begun hiring workers for the venture.For its part, Ford has announced it is working with GE Healthcare to increase production of GE's ventilators.Jim Baumbick is the vice president in charge of all of Ford's vehicle product lines, but lately he's turned his attention to gearing up healthcare technology production.He said Ford, which introduced mass production to the auto industry, has identified efficiencies that can be made to GE's production processes that will increase output in coming weeks. Ford has also been able to find additional suppliers for some parts that make up the ventilators, Baumbick said, so that GE doesn't face bottlenecks in its supply chain.The automaker has even suggested changes to parts so they could be more easily produced by other suppliers. GE Healthcare declined to provide additional details about its work with Ford, but did say it is planning to double its output by the end of June.Toyota is also \"finalizing agreements to begin working with at least two companies that produce ventilators and respirators to help increase their capacity,\" the company said Friday in an emailed statement. Toyota did not say which medical device companies are involved.A less complex machine Medtronic makes less complex ventilator machines for the less critically ill as well, and the firm is considering making \"one or two\" of its designs open source. That would allow outside manufacturers to take over production of fully functioning machines. Jamali said he is confident automakers could get the job done. But, he added, \"the question is: What is the time frame of when you start and when you're meaningfully putting ventilators on the market?\" Jamali said.As part of its partnership with GE Healthcare, Ford is helping to design a new, simple ventilator that would be relatively easy to produce, Baumbick said. To do this, Ford and GE designers are starting with a machine used for anesthesia. It's a machine that, at its core, is a sort of ventilator. The idea, Baumbick said, is to strip away anything that isn't needed for breathing.\"It's kind of getting down to first principles,\" Baumbick said. Medical supplies were displayed at the Jacob Javits Center before a news conference with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.Once that machine has been successfully designed, he said, it could be manufactured at a facility outside of GE. It could even be made at a Ford factory, he added. But the companies did not give a timeline for when that production could begin. The Food and Drug Administration says it has implemented drastic regulatory changes to allow automakers and other non-medical manufacturers to quickly take up such tasks.\"FDA's message is clear,\" the agency said in a March 22 statement. \"If you want to help expand production of ventilators to save American lives in this pandemic, we are going to work with you to sweep every possible barrier out of your way.\"James Dyson designed a new ventilator in 10 days. He's making 15,000 for the pandemic fightFor example, the agency said it is not enforcing rules that require ventilator manufacturers to gain FDA approval before making slight changes to their devices. That approach \"will help manufacturers that want to add production lines or manufacture at alternative sites [that] may have different manufacturing equipment,\" according to the FDA guidance.Intellectual property concerns loomBut some traditional manufacturers remain cautious about working with third parties. If there is a flaw in production, \"it would be a catastrophe if you got those devices out en masse,\" said Jamali. \"You could cause a lot of damage in the patients that are most acute.\"Intellectual property rights may also present obstacles. Designs for ventilators, their software or key components are often patented or involve trade secrets. The medical device industry has \"historically been extremely sensitive about protecting its intellectual property,\" said Debbie Wang, a Morningstar analyst who covers Medtronic. \"And I can't imagine that would necessarily go away,\" she added \u2014 even in the face of a pandemic.Patrick Keane, an IP attorney that works with hospitals and ventilator manufacturers, agreed that intellectual property concerns could make traditional manufacturers hesitant to work with third-party manufacturers.The Defense Production Act is the most powerful tool the government has to ensure that doesn't happen. Invoking it allows the White House to direct production. What is the Defense Production Act?It will be up to the companies who are given ventilator manufacturer directives to ensure they aren't liable for patent infringement after the crisis passes, according to Keane.The president was under growing pressure to use his DPA powers in order to better coordinate the production and distribution of badly needed ventilators. Doing so, proponents argued, would alleviate the concerns of state governors, such as New York's Cuomo, who are desperate for new ventilators.But the issue will continue to come back to a major supply gap and a race against the clock. Current ventilator production levels fall far short of demand \u2014 and setting up new production lines is no simple task.\"You don't want people who are producing air conditioning units for cars to all of a sudden start producing entire ventilators,\" he said.",

        "content": "Monday, February 17. The novel coronavirus outbreak is raging in China, but fewer than 1,000 people have been infected outside the country. With the virus out of sight and mostly out of mind, the Dow Jones Industrial Average stands just shy of 30,000 points, driven by the longest US economic expansion in history.What investors couldn't know is that over the next 30 days, the coronavirus would burst out of quarantine in China, with major outbreaks in South Korea and Italy, then Spain, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. It brought business to a sudden stop, sent stock markets into a meltdown and forced central banks to take emergency action on a scale even greater than during the 2008 global financial crisis. A global recession, once unthinkable in 2020, is now a foregone conclusion and some experts warn that the pandemic could drag the world's economy into a depression. More bad news: The coronavirus outbreak may just be getting started.Central banks and governments are now unleashing a tsunami of interest rate cuts, loan guarantees and new spending, tapping emergency powers to reassure investors, cushion the shock to companies and workers and preserve the foundations of a functioning economy for the future. In the United States, the Trump administration is asking Congress to approve a rescue bill that would inject $1 trillion into the economy to prevent mass layoffs as huge swaths of the world's biggest economy shut down and airlines, hotels and restaurants run out of cash. In an extraordinary move, the UK government on Friday said it would pay 80% of the wages of anyone at risk of losing their job because of the pandemic. Cash handouts are coming as countries do 'whatever it takes' to survive the pandemic shockRead MoreYet the rescue efforts may already be too late. Goldman Sachs estimates that 2.25 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits this week \u2014 that would be the biggest number on record. Meanwhile, the number of coronavirus cases marches higher. The global number of infections has topped 270,000, and more than 11,000 people have been killed worldwide. Spain, Italy, France and the United Kingdom are under partial or complete lockdowns. California, which boasts the world's fifth largest economy, has directed 40 million people to stay at home. \"The coronavirus has created unprecedented financial and societal disruption,\" David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, said this week. Most exposed to the fallout are businesses and workers in transport, the energy industry and hospitality as international aviation shuts down, oil consumption collapses and pubs, bars and restaurants are ordered to close. \"In the worst case, entire industries could be destroyed,\" Moody's Investor Services said in a note on Friday.While the pandemic is still unfolding, economists are already thinking about how it will change the world. Many expect significant shifts in how supply chains are constructed and how global trade is conducted. The merits of capitalism, democratic systems of government and globalization are likely to come under intense scrutiny. A warning from AppleFebruary 17 was a holiday in the United States and stock markets were closed. But on that Monday, Apple sounded the alarm. It warned that it wouldn't meet its revenue projections for the first three months of the year because the coronavirus had reduced iPhone manufacturing capacity in China, and with Chinese stores closed or operating reduced hours, demand for the company's products was also dropping. When US markets reopened on February 18, investors pushed the company's stock down by 2.6%.Coronavirus could spark another Great Depression, former Trump adviser warns The initial hit to its stock may have been modest, but Apple was the first major US company to warn that the coronavirus was affecting its business in a big way. What's more, Apple laid out exactly why the epidemic was such a big threat: the reaction to the outbreak was hammering both supply and demand. That dual threat is exactly why pandemics can be much more damaging than many other \"black swan\" events. People are more likely to stay home during an outbreak to avoid getting sick. Doing so limits demand for consumer goods and services, as well as energy. Decisions by companies and governments to close shops and idle factories, meanwhile, curtail production. \"A severe pandemic would resemble a global war in its sudden, profound, and widespread impact,\" the World Bank said in a report from 2013.In the month following Apple's (AAPL) warning, thousands more companies came under huge pressure. Carmakers, which rely on global supply chains and timely deliveries to keep their plants open, shuttered factories in Europe and then the United States. Airlines canceled international flights to China, and then just about everywhere else. CAPA Centre for Aviation, a consultancy, says most carriers will be bankrupt by the end of May unless governments bail them out. Cathay Pacific planes are seen parked on the tarmac in Hong Kong.Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University, said the nature of the pandemic will encourage companies to begin reviewing the costs of global economic integration. \"The free flow of goods, capital, and people has generated enormous benefits but also created channels for rapid worldwide contagion from financial shocks, geopolitical conflicts, and epidemics,\" he said. The debate over how companies and governments should respond is already underway, with some observers arguing that countries must make more essential products including medical supplies at home in order to prevent shortages, an impulse that could accelerate a rollback of globalization exemplified by the trade war between the United States and China. But William Reinsch, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that the pandemic can't undo the technological advances that have dramatically boosted global trade over the past 50 years. \"The larger question is whether those tools will be used in the same way and to the same degree as they have been,\" he said. One change that Reinsch sees coming is how executives think about the supplies they need. \"The coronavirus crisis has taught them that supply chains are a lot more fragile than they thought, that supplies can be suddenly interrupted for unexpected reasons, and that a prudent manager will not only have a Plan B, but a Plan C and Plan D as well,\" he said.Policymakers respond as markets crashStarting on February 18, US stocks entered a stunning freefall that wiped away roughly a third of their value and ended the longest bull market in history. The Dow has fallen nearly 35% since Apple issued its coronavirus warning, posting shock declines on March 9 (-7.8%), March 12 (-10%) and March 16 (-12.9%). The index closed at 19,174 points on Friday.Markets in Europe and Asia have also plunged. Europe's Stoxx 600 has lost roughly a third of its value since February 18, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index has dropped 18% over the same time period. According to Bank of America, $27 trillion has been wiped off global stocks since the end of January. Companies exposed to fallout from the pandemic have seen their stocks decimated. Shares in United Airlines (UAL) are down roughly 70% so far this year, while French carmaker Renault (RNLSY) has plummeted 62%. Marriott International's (MAR) stock is down 50% over the same period. Share prices may come under even more pressure. According to Neil Shearing, the chief economist at Capital Economics, the ability of central banks to put a floor under stock markets is limited. \"History suggests that equity markets are only likely to bottom out when it becomes clear that the flow of new cases of the virus has peaked. Until this happens, we should expect stock markets to remain under pressure,\" he said.US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell gives a press briefing after the surprise rate cut on March 3.Central banks have responded to the mounting economic devastation by slashing interest rates and using other tools in their arsenal to support growth and prevent financial markets from seizing up. The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates at emergency meetings on March 3 and March 15, reducing them to a record low near zero while committing $750 billion to buy government bonds and other securities. The Bank of England has also cut interest rates twice, on March 11 and March 19. In Japan and Europe, where interest rates have been in negative territory for years, central banks have joined the Fed in announcing hundreds of billions of dollars worth of asset purchases.     Governments have promised to inject huge sums into the economy. Morgan Stanley says spending commitments from the United States, Europe, Japan, the United Kingdom and China add up to at least $1.7 trillion. And a much larger sum has been promised in the form of credit guarantees.\"While the initial response from developed economies was slow, over the last few days \u2014 as economic and financial market disruptions persist \u2014 we have started to see strong commitments from policy makers, indicating a sizable fiscal expansion plan is in the offing,\" Morgan Stanley chief economist Chetan Ahya told clients on Thursday.What happens nextGoldman Sachs warned Friday that US GDP could plummet at an annual rate of 24% during the second quarter, with unemployment peaking around 9% later this year. The bank said that reports suggest a \"sudden surge in layoffs and a collapse in spending, both historic in size and speed.\"The economic collapse predicted by Goldman would be significantly worse than the sharpest contraction during the Great Recession, when GDP dropped by a rate of 8.4% in the fourth quarter of 2008. It would also surpass the previous post-World-War-II record of 10% set in early 1958.Recently assembled vehicles made by Peugeot owner PSA Group, which has closed plants due to coronavirus.The picture is much the same in other countries where businesses are shutting down because of the coronavirus. According to Deutsche Bank, if the pandemic affects the United Kingdom for longer than expected, its economy could shrink 6% this year as the country plunges into the worst recession in a century.Kevin Hassett, an economist and former CNN contributor who is returning to the Trump administration to help the coronavirus response, said this week that the pandemic could spark a repeat of the Great Depression that began in 1929 and lasted for years.\"We're going to have to either have a Great Depression, or figure out a way to send people back to work even though that's risky,\" he said. \"Because at some point, we can't not have an economy, right?\"\u2014 Julia Horowitz and Matt Egan contributed reporting.",

        "content": "By Sunday, Stew Leonard Jr. and his team were ready for a break. \"Saturday was really, really busy,\" Leonard, the CEO and president of Stew Leonard's, a grocery store chain with seven locations across New York, Connecticut and New Jersey, said. \"Everybody was exhausted after Saturday.\" Sunday was a day to take stock of what was left in his supermarkets. As soon as they were back in order, Leonard had to prepare for another busy day. Before his stores opened on Monday morning, there were lines of people waiting to get in. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, Leonard has seen spikes in customer visits. After a recent presidential address about the outbreak, people swarmed his stores, he said. When the stock market crashed and rumors spread about closures and restrictions in New York and New Jersey, the same thing happened. As Americans grow more nervous about the implications of the global pandemic, and as the government puts extraordinary limitations on public life, customers across the country have been clearing supermarkets like Stew Leonard's of essential items. Toilet paper is out. Paper towels are out. Hand sanitizer has been out for weeks. Shoppers are snapping up nonperishable items like canned goods and cereal and emptying shelves of fresh staples like milk, meat and bread. A worker restocks the meat section of a Stop & Shop supermarket in North Providence, Rhode Island. (David Goldman/AP)Read MoreIt's not unusual for grocery stores to see a run on items during times of crisis. People stock up ahead of hurricanes, tornadoes and other natural disasters. But natural disasters don't affect all of America, much less the world. Food demand in retail locations is at \"unprecedented levels,\" said Morris Cohen, a professor of operations, information and decisions at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton business school. \"There will be spot shortages caused by panic buying,\" he noted. But if you go into a grocery store right now and don't see what you want, that doesn't mean that what you want isn't out there somewhere. People aren't eating more food. They're just eating it at home. Empty shelves mean there's a bottleneck, not a shortage. Food that had been destined for restaurants, bars, offices and other gathering places will need to go to homes instead, and the system will have to account for the increased volume of groceries Americans cooking at home are suddenly buying. But the supply chain is built for some disruption, and there's cushioning for it. Our food system can deal with the current demand; it just has to relearn how to distribute the supply. As long as farmers can keep farming, truckers can keep driving, packaging can be made and supplied and grocery stores can stay open, the empty shelves should be just a temporary inconvenience. A major break in that system, however, could cause real trouble. Big grocery chains have a large network of suppliers. (Mary Altaffer/AP)A network, not a chainThe current surge in demand may be unprecedented, but supply chains are built to react to disruptions. A bad crop yield or a factory fire could lead retailers to swap suppliers or turn to alternative products. Those types of behind-the-scenes impacts aren't rare. But they are rarely seen by consumers. Major supermarket chains and retailers have networks that stretch into suppliers all over the world, Cohen said. If there are shortages from one supplier, they can turn to another. To think about how supply chains work, it's best not to imagine a physical chain, Cohen explained. Instead, picture a network: \"If one pathway is broken, if one link in it is severed, there are alternative paths.\" Though Stew Leonard's is a fraction of the size of national grocery chains like Publix or others, Leonard also relies on a network for his products. That has helped him avoid running out of fresh food at his stores. \"We have had to switch over to other suppliers\" for fresh staples like milk and meat, Leonard said. \"What we've been able to do is get plenty of butter, eggs and milk. Meat we've had no problem,\" he said.  The shelves do have product. They are stocked. They are getting restocked on a regular basis. The supply chain in this country is very efficient and it's very effective.\"Greg Ferrara, president and CEO, National Grocers AssociationGreg Ferrara, president and CEO of the National Grocers Association, which represents about 21,000 independently-owned grocery stores in the United States, said that his members have seen an \"astronomical\" surge in demand. \"However,\" he added, \"the shelves do have product. They are stocked. They are getting restocked on a regular basis. The supply chain in this country is very efficient and it's very effective.\"Over time, and if the situation persists, some food could be diverted from certain vendors to others. Food that had been shipped to corporate and university cafeterias, cruise lines, airlines and restaurants could instead be sent to grocery stores and retailers. Some companies are already starting to make adjustments. Baldor, a New York City firm which sells food to restaurants, schools and other food service outlets, is now offering delivery to individuals. The existing supply \"has to be reallocated,\" said Cohen. \"There has to be an efficient way of doing that. And that could be a challenge because this is going outside the normal structure of how business is conducted.\" But, he noted, eventually a balance should be reached. Shoppers are stocking up on canned foods and other shelf-stable products. (Jeremy Hogan/Echoes Wire/Barcroft Media/Getty Images)Shelf-stable goods makers react As people rush to buy canned food and other nonperishable items, big consumer goods companies are trying to meet demand without needlessly ratcheting up production. Bumble Bee Foods, which sells canned fish, \"has seen a spike in demand,\" President and CEO Jan Tharp told CNN Business in an email. \"We are in constant communication with both our suppliers and customers and have been successful at keeping up with the accelerated sale of our products.\" General Mills, which sells a vast portfolio of well-known brands like Cheerios, Annie's snacks and pasta and Progresso soups, among others, is seeing \"a short-term increase in customer orders in the US,\" said Kelsey Roemhildt, corporate communications manager for the company. Demand for soup, cereal, snacks and dry baking mixes in particular has gone up. To help meet that spike, General Mills is taking steps like increasing production of some items. \"Up until this point, the supply chain has been working remarkably well,\" CEO Jeff Harmening said during a discussion of the company's third quarter financial results Wednesday. \"Food continues to flow, we continue to make it. Our retailers continue to stock as quickly as they can. And that all is actually working pretty well.\" Harmening added that \"we anticipate continuing production\" as usual, noting that the company is encouraging social distancing at work and taking other measures to try to keep employees safe. Everybody who works in supply chain just rues the day when this bullwhip effect gets started.\" Willy Shih, professor of management practice in business administration, Harvard Business SchoolStill, some disruptions are inevitable. Nestl\u00e9, which sells frozen meals, bottled water, baby food, cereal, chocolate and other items, warned of delays in Europe because of border closures. But the company noted that in the United States, supply is \"relatively insulated\" because most ingredients are locally sourced. \"Our factory, warehouse and distribution centers remain open, with additional measures in place to ensure the safety of our employees and business partners,\" a Nestl\u00e9 spokesperson said. And companies have to be careful about dramatically increasing production. People only need so much of toilet paper or shelf-stable goods. Eventually, they'll start dipping into their own supplies rather than shopping for more, and demand will fall. Any manufacturers that hire more employees or open new facilities because they see the higher demand as a new normal could pay a price.  There's a name for that phenomenon, explained Willy Shih, a professor of management practice in business administration at the Harvard Business School. It's called the \"bullwhip effect.\"  \"Everybody who works in supply chain just rues the day when this bullwhip effect gets started,\" he said. \"And that's in fact what we're seeing now.\"The bullwhip effect is one reason it's important to tamp down panic buying, and try to prevent people from purchasing more than they need. Some retailers are limiting purchases of some items in an attempt to stop customers from hoarding. (Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images)Rationing supply  Facing the surge in demand, grocery stores and retailers are limiting sales of certain items to try to prevent panic shopping and hoarding, and give them a chance to restock shelves.Walmart said that some items, including cleaning supplies and paper products, are in high demand. It is working to restock those products quickly by sending deliveries directly to stores and prioritizing shipments to certain regions. The chain has instructed store managers to limit sales on high-demand items at their discretion.Kroger is capping purchases of cold, flu and sanitary products. In a message to customers, CEO Rodney McMullen said that the company's supply chain teams are trying to make sure that items are available as soon as possible. Publix is also limiting the purchase of certain items, as is H-E-B. \"Panic does not promote progress,\" the Texas chain said in a release, adding that customers should come back if they don't find what they need the first time.There are companies that may be weighing whether it makes sense to increase production in order to avoid the bullwhip effect. But others may not have that option. Some toilet paper makers say they'd been running factories 24 hours a day, seven days a week as their normal practice. For them, ramping up production would be all but impossible, even if they wanted to. Farmers who raise dairy cows or cattle or grow produce are in similar situations. They can't immediately grow more crops or milk more cows. And they may not have to -\u2014 they just have to figure out where to ship their products. And their farms must continue to function. Industry associations representing farmers have said they're not too worried about the short-term food supply, but if their workers get sick, that could strain their operations. (Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images)Support for farmers  A resilient supply chain should be able to withstand shocks. But it needs enough food in the system to work. So far, our fresh food supply has avoided major disruptions. Jim Mulhern, president and CEO of the National Milk Producers Federation, offered a reassuring perspective on dairy production. \"Dairy supplies aren't experiencing production interruptions at this time,\" he said in a statement Monday. \"The US food-supply chain is more than capable of meeting demand.\" Before the crisis hit, US farmers were on track to produce record amounts of poultry, beef, pork and milk, said John Newton, chief economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation, which represents farmers. And the food should be safe to eat. The USDA has said it is \"not aware of any reports at this time of human illnesses that suggest COVID-19 can be transmitted by food or food packaging.\" There's no crisis in the food supply right now. Our concern is what's going to come six months later.\"  Zippy Duvall, president, American Farm Bureau FederationZippy Duvall, the Farm Bureau's president, said he's not worried about the short term \u2014 but he has concerns about what could happen months from now. \"There's no crisis in the food supply right now,\" he told CNN Business. \"Our concern is what's going to come six months later.\"  A number of factors could threaten the food supply moving forward. Tyson, one of the world's largest meat producers, warned in a recent SEC filing that \"if a significant percentage of our workforce is unable to work, including because of illness or travel or government restrictions in connection with pandemics or disease outbreaks, our operations may be negatively impacted.\"  If farmers get sick or have to significantly alter the way they work because of safety measures, the food supply could take a hit. If transportation systems break down, or if truckers are unable to deliver products, our access to the food those farmers grow could be threatened. Duvall is particularly concerned over a recent decision by the federal government to suspend immigrant visa services in Mexico, another attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Farmers rely on immigrant labor, and Duvall worries that the changes will affect harvesting in the spring and planting in the summer. He recommended that the administration classify farm workers as emergency workers on applications for temporary agricultural work visas. \"Empty shelves can be frightening, but empty fields and barns would be devastating,\" he warned. Duvall noted that he has been pleased with the Trump administration's efforts to help farmers so far. For now, however, the system is working. \"The supplies are there,\" Newton said. \"The key is making sure that the supply chain remains very strong, and the key component of that strong supply chain is access to labor.\"",

        "content": "If Hoan Ton-That is feeling the pressure, he isn't showing it.  Over the last month, fears about facial recognition technology and police surveillance have intensified, all thanks to Ton-That's startup, Clearview AI. First came a front-page investigation in The New York Times, revealing Clearview has been working with law enforcement agencies to match photos of unknown faces to people's online images. Next, cease-and-desist letters rolled in from tech giants Twitter, Google and Facebook. Lawmakers made inquiries and New Jersey enacted a statewide ban on law enforcement using Clearview while it looks into the software. But during an interview at CNN's studios in New York City last week, Ton-That didn't seem particularly fazed, saying the last few weeks were \"interesting.\" He demonstrated the technology and described himself as \"honored\" to kick off a broader conversation about facial recognition and privacy. He's eager to build  a \"great American company\" with  \"the best of intentions\" and wouldn't sell his product to Iran, Russia or China, he said. He claimed the technology is saving kids and solving crimes. And he said he welcomes government regulation.Read MoreBut so far, Ton-That and Clearview have triggered more concerns than acclaim.Despite the backlash to his technology, Hoan Ton-That, the CEO of Clearview AI, told CNN Business he feels \"honored\" to kick off a broader conversation about facial recognition and privacy. (Niamh McDonnell / CNN)A face in the crowd Clearview AI is controversial for many reasons, but perhaps the most important is its massive database. The company claims to have scraped more than 3 billion photos from the internet, including from popular social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube. Not only that, but Clearview retains those photos in its database even after users delete them from the platforms or make their accounts private.Clearview sells access to its database to law enforcement agencies, so those agencies can match unknown faces to other images. CNN Business saw firsthand how the technology works in a demonstration last week. First, Ton-That ran a photo of my face though the database, pulling up in seconds multiple different pictures of me from across the internet.Most jarringly, he found a photo that I had probably not seen in more than a decade, a picture that ran in a local newspaper in Ireland when I was 15-years-old and in high school. Needless to say, I look a lot different now than I did then; in fact, my producer, who has to spend far more time than she'd like looking at me through a camera, didn't even recognize me. But the system did. Clearview has given similar demonstrations to law enforcement, and some have been convinced to hand over taxpayers' dollars for the tool. The Chicago Police Department, for instance, is paying almost $50,000 for a two-year Clearview \"pilot,\" a police spokesperson confirmed to CNN Business.Within seconds, Clearview pulled up an old photo of CNN Business' Donie O'Sullivan, from when he was 15 years old. CNN has blurred faces in this photo to protect people's privacy. (Niamh McDonnell / CNN)But clearly, I wasn't a random person Ton-That had pulled from a crowd. He knew he was coming to CNN to meet me and he knew I'd ask him to run my face through his system. He even admitted he had searched my images before we met. (And, it's worth noting, though the photo is old and I'm almost unrecognizable, the page it's on does include a caption with my name.)So we surprised him and also asked him to run a search for my producer.That at least appeared to make Ton-That a little nervous.  \"Can we cut this if it doesn't work?\" he quipped.  We said no. But it did work. As we scrolled through the images it had found, my producer noticed that Clearview had found pictures from her Instagram account, even though her account has been private, accessible only to her followers. Ton-That explained that Clearview had probably downloaded the photos from her account before she had made it private last year.Ton-That's representative had my producer's name in advance of the interview but Ton-That said he had not run her face before the live demonstration.Both Clearview tests for my producer and I returned no false positives.Scary but effective?The parts of Ton-That's demonstration that spooked my producer and me \u2014 his access to photos that are no longer publicly available online and his ability to find a photo of me as a minor \u2014 are likely among the things his law enforcement clients find appealing. He said more than 600 law enforcement agencies in the US and Canada are using the tool, a number CNN Business has not independently verified, and when asked, he wouldn't specify how many are paying customers versus those using free trials. He also said that a number of banks are using Clearview software for fraud investigations, but declined to name any of the banks. CNN Business reached out to America's 20 largest bank chains. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, US Bank, Ally Bank and SunTrust all denied using the software. The others either declined to comment or didn't respond to CNN Business' request for comment.  At least some of Clearview's clients, like the Chicago Police Department, appear to be under the impression that the company only has access to public images that anyone could find online \u2014 but clearly, in the case of my producer, Clearview also has access to some information that is no longer public. When asked to clarify its stance, a Chicago Police Department spokesperson told CNN Business \"the message here is that the information gained from Clearview was at one point placed in the public domain.\" Ton-That claims Clearview is 99% accurate and doesn't turn back higher errors when searching for people of color, a problem that's well-documented among other facial recognition tools. CNN Business has not conducted a full analysis of Clearview's software. Some law enforcement agencies do report instances in which they believe the tool has been effective.In New Jersey, Clearview was used as part of an investigation into a child predator ring. Police there used Clearview in a sting to identify a man before he showed up for what he believed was a meeting with a minor, Gurbir Grewal, the New Jersey Attorney General, told CNN Business. In that instance, Clearview helped police look into the man's background before he walked into the sting and helped them determine if he was likely to be armed, Grewal said. Despite its apparent utility, the attorney general -- who only learned about Clearview and its use in New Jersey after The New York Times' report on the company \u2014 ordered law enforcement in the state to stop using the technology until a review is completed.\"I was deeply disturbed,\" he told CNN Business. \"I was concerned about how Clearview had amassed its database of images that it uses with its technology. I was concerned about its data privacy and cybersecurity measures that it takes.\" Ton-That told O'Sullivan that he's ready to defend Clearview AI's technology in court, if necessary. (Niamh McDonnell / CNN)Shutting the barn doorAccording to Ton-That, Clearview has downloaded billions of images from major social media platforms and from all different kinds of websites across the internet \u2014 including, evidently, from my local newspaper.Downloading and storing pictures this way is against most of the major social media platforms' policies. The practice has prompted the likes of Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to send Clearview cease-and-desist letters. Despite Facebook's concerns about the company, Peter Thiel, who sits on Facebook's board was an early investor in Clearview. Facebook, Thiel, and Ton-That all declined to comment on whether Thiel knew about how Clearview was downloading Facebook data and that it was against Facebook's rules.\"In 2017, Peter gave a talented young founder $200,000, which two years later converted to equity in Clearview AI. That was Peter's only contribution; he is not involved in the company,\" Jeremiah Hall, a spokesperson for Thiel told CNN Business. The cease-and-desist letters don't seem to faze Ton-That and maybe for good reason.I was deeply disturbed. I was concerned about how Clearview had amassed its database of images that it uses with its technology. I was concerned about its data privacy and cybersecurity measures that it takes.\" Gurbir Grewal, New Jersey Attorney GeneralTechnology companies have essentially no control of what happens to data, in this case pictures, after they are downloaded from their platforms. Ensuring someone actually complies with a cease-and-desist letter when it comes to data is also essentially impossible. Once images are downloaded, as they have been by Clearview, they can be copied again and again, stored on multiple computers and servers in different places all around the world, and that's even before they are distributed or made available to third parties. Clearview's clients can access the images.In 2015, Facebook asked Cambridge Analytica to delete Facebook data it had gathered, but when it emerged in 2018 that all the data may not have been deleted, it turned into one of the greatest scandals Facebook had confronted in its history.Ton-That's defense of his technology and his collection methods may land him in court and make him party to landmark rulings that set precedent for how American grapples with artificial intelligence in the 21st century.Asked if he is ready to step out from behind the computer screen to face days in court, he says, \"Sure. Yeah. I don't think there'll be that many.\"",

        "content": "Emily Cunningham, a user experience designer, is just one of 750,000 people who work for Amazon. Like most rank-and-file employees in corporate America, she doesn't have a direct line to the CEO; nor does she usually have much sway over what the company does. But Cunningham does own more than $2,000 in Amazon stock, and at the company's annual shareholder meeting this May, that little slice of ownership entitled her to a voice. So she stood up to use it.\"I would like to ask for Jeff Bezos to come out on stage so that I can speak to him directly,\" Cunningham began, speaking into a cavernous auditorium in Seattle. She hadn't been able to get through the words during a practice session the night before, breaking down in tears every time she tried. This time, however, it came out smoothly, as she drew strength from a group of colleagues in the audience, all clad in white.\"Mr. Bezos will be out later,\" said the event's emcee, Amazon General Counsel David Zapolsky. \"Will he be hearing this speech?\" Cunningham asked.Emily Cunningham and other Amazon employees filed a shareholder resolution, asking Amazon to create a plan to cut its reliance on fossil fuels. (Jovelle Tamayo for CNN)Read More\"I assume so,\" Zapolsky replied. Cunningham never did find out whether Bezos had been there to hear her speech, which was about climate change \u2014 but it didn't matter. She and other Amazon employees had filed a formal shareholder resolution, asking Amazon to create a plan to cut its reliance on fossil fuels. The proposal secured support from 31% of the shares that were voted.That may not sound like a win, but in the world of shareholder resolutions, in which votes are symbolic and not binding, it was a resounding result \u2014 the kind of message even a $900 billion company couldn't ignore. Four months later, amid growing scrutiny from shareholders and employees, Bezos announced a pledge to make Amazon carbon neutral by 2040.Cunningham is just one person in a long line of shareholders who have used their stakes to push corporations to address social and environmental issues. But on Tuesday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission took a significant step to curtail their power.Raising the thresholdsThe rules around how shareholders engage with the companies they own are complicated and may seem arcane, but the stakes are high. It's a battle about the nature of capitalism and public markets, who controls the engines of commerce, and by what standards they should be judged. On Tuesday, five SEC commissioners passionately debated those points in an open meeting. The regulators, led by Chairman Jay Clayton, voted 3-to-2 to propose new rules that, among other things, would make it harder for small investors to get a proposal on a shareholder ballot.Corporate America was pleased. The Business Roundtable, US Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers all applauded the decision. The Chamber has in fact been banging this drum for more than a decade. \"Shareholder activism that elevates one group's agenda over the goals of other investors doesn't just ruin companies \u2014 it ruins a country,\" Chamber CEO Thomas Donohue said in a speech in 2006.  Companies have been speaking out against shareholder rights for a long time, but recently, they've picked up the megaphone again. For the last year, companies in the oil and gas industry, along with conservative think tanks, the NASDAQ stock exchange and pro-business lobbying groups have been pressuring the SEC to make changes that could dampen shareholder rights. Why now? Shareholders have been filing more environmental and social proposals than ever before. Amazon Employees for Climate Justice demonstrated outside of Amazon's annual shareholder meeting in Seattle in May 2019. (Jovelle Tamayo for CNN)The power of a proposalOver the years, small investors have used shareholder proposals as a tool to advocate for change on many issues, ranging from board nominations and executive compensation to social and environmental causes. Among them: General Motors' exit from apartheid South Africa. The phaseout of styrofoam cups at McDonald's. The end of assault rifle sales at Walmart. Since the 1940s, shareholders have had the right to pose questions and propose changes to the directors of public companies, and to put those proposals up for a vote by their fellow investors. And the bar to propose a resolution has been relatively low. Since 1998, it's been set at just $2,000 in stock or 1% of a company's shares \u2014 whichever is lower. (For most publicly-traded companies, $2,000 is, by far, the lower threshold.) Currently, a shareholder must own at least that much stock, continuously, for at least a year to qualify.\n\nThe proposals, which are sometimes called \"proxies\" because shareholders can delegate their votes to others, come from a variety of sources: individual investors, large asset managers, labor unions, public pension funds, or activist Catholic nuns.For Natasha Lamb, it's a job. As managing partner of Arjuna Capital, a socially-oriented investment fund, she's leveraged shareholder proposals to push for gender equality at companies ranging from Facebook to Citigroup, and prompted meaningful change. Natasha Lamb, managing partner of the investment fund Arjuna Capital, uses shareholder proposals to push for gender equity. (Jovelle Tamayo for CNN)After an Arjuna-backed campaign between 2016 and 2018, 22 companies agreed to disclose the pay gap between their male and female employees, adjusted for job titles. Those wins came when a resolution didn't earn the majority of votes. That's because shareholder proposals are not won by a majority. In fact, they're not really won at all \u2014 even if a proposal earns a majority of votes, the company is generally not required to make a change. But they are meaningful in a symbolic way, serving as both a battle cry and negotiating tool from shareholders who want to agitate for corporate accountability.That's because companies know that if the shareholders don't feel heard, they can wield power in other ways: they can oust members of the board, vote down executive pay packages and, ultimately, divest from the company. To keep them happy companies have to pay attention to what they want. Sometimes, wins can be achieved even when the proposal didn't make it onto a shareholder ballot. Lamb has at times found that just the threat of a high-profile shareholder battle can prompt a company to preemptively make changes behind closed doors. For the companies, negotiating with activist shareholders behind the scenes can keep the shareholders' complaints out of the news and potentially stave off a public relations crisis.\"The shareholder proposal itself is a critical piece on the board, if you think about it in terms of chess,\" Lamb said. \"But the win is if you have a productive dialogue with the company ... that's success.\" Lamb sees shareholder proposals as a way to guide companies toward better returns, noting that Arjuna encourages companies to act within their \"enlightened self interest.\" After all, Arjuna Capital manages clients' money, and higher financial returns are the goal. She sees equal pay and climate change initiatives as a way to boost those returns. Shareholder resolutions can be used to advance a wide range of positions \u2014 not just traditionally liberal causes. Justin Danhof, general counsel for the National Center for Public Policy Research, has used them to try to push companies to the political right, leading a team that took \"the model of liberal shareholder activism and did a 180.\"Justin Danhof, general counsel for the National Center for Public Policy Research, uses shareholder proposals to push companies to add conservative directors to their boards. (Jovelle Tamayo for CNN)He has filed a number of proposals urging companies like Starbucks, Apple, Amazon and Facebook to consider adopting \"true diversity.\" In his view, this means adding conservative directors to corporate boards.Danhof targets corporations because they're \"much more amenable to pressure than most politicians,\" he explained. \"I consider filing a shareholder resolution the opening salvo in a negotiation.\"Sounding the alarmCompanies have never loved dealing with their shareholders. But for some, the last two years of mounting activism have been downright alarming. As asset managers like BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard have become increasingly willing to throw their considerable heft behind environmental and social resolutions, companies have started seeing proxy votes as threats. In 2019, average overall support for environmental and social shareholder resolutions reached an all-time high of 28%, buoyed in part by \"yes\" votes from institutional investors, noted an analysis from the EY Center for Board Matters. Once shareholder resolutions achieve 30% support, the report explained, companies tend to pay attention. If a proposal reaches 50%, and investors feel that the company hasn't sufficiently responded, they tend to consider voting directors out. This year, Amazon alone received 14 shareholder resolutions \u2014 more than any other company, according to a count by Alliance Advisors. Though a couple were either withdrawn by their proponents or excluded with the permission of the SEC, 12 measures on issues ranging from food waste to hate speech made it onto ballots. Corporate America has had enough \u2014 and it's using its full toolkit to fight back.In addition to negotiating behind the scenes and asking the SEC to exclude shareholder resolutions from proxy ballots, corporations are pressing for changes in laws and regulations that could stop troublesome shareholder campaigns before they start.Shareholder proposals that focus on social and environmental issues, like the one sponsored by Amazon employees, have been gaining more votes in recent years. (Jovelle Tamayo for CNN) That's where Tuesday's SEC meeting comes in.The regulator proposed that shareholders be required to hold at least $25,000 in a company's stock if they want to file a resolution after just one year of ownership.Smaller shareholders with just $2,000 in stock would have to own it for at least three years before they become eligible to file a resolution.That higher threshold could shut small investors out. SEC Commissioner Allison Herren Lee, who dissented against that change, noted the $25,000 threshold is prohibitive for most retail investors, who have a median stock portfolio of $27,700.\"Main Street investors would generally have to invest virtually their entire portfolio into one company \u2014 something we strongly discourage \u2014 to enjoy the same rights as Wall Street investors, or they would have to wait three years to catch up to them,\" she said. Large companies, however, argue that small shareholders should not be allowed to exert an outsized influence. The Business Roundtable has said that shareholders may use proposals as a form of \"social commentary or to advocate for a social aim, regardless of the proposal's financial impact on the company.\" Corporations also say they end up racking up significant legal costs to respond to each proposal \u2014 ExxonMobil, for example, notes that it incurs more than $100,000 in costs per proposal, adding that \"our experience is that the costs can greatly exceed this amount based on the significant board and senior management time dedicated to each proposal.\" (Assuming a cost of about $100,000 per proposal, even a dozen proposals, amounting to $1.2 million, wouldn't put much of a dent in the company's budget \u2014 Exxon reported $21 billion in earnings in 2018.) Companies also don't like that just a handful of particularly-active shareholders \u2014 four people in total \u2014 file more than a quarter of shareholder proposals every year. Jay Clayton, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, voted in favor of changing the current shareholder proposal rules. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Other rule changes proposed by the SEC would make it harder for shareholders to resubmit repeat proposals and could make proxy advisory firms that vet shareholder resolutions more beholden to the companies they analyze. It can take time for shareholders to raise awareness and build support for an issue that eventually hits the main stream, like pay parity, and higher resubmission thresholds could shut out meaningful proposals as they gain steam. It's hard for experts to predict exactly what changing the ownership threshold and rules around resubmission would do to shareholder activism. What's clear is that tighter regulations could very well shut people out, and make it easier for companies to ignore their shareholders \u2014 possibly to the detriment of other stakeholders.Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, noted that restrictions on shareholder rights could end up hurting companies, as well. \"If you try to attempt to limit [shareholder resolutions], in one way or another, inadvertently you may remove from consideration a resolution that has greater core significance to the company,\" he said. \"A rule that is less restrictive is probably the better rule.\" The updates are now subject to a 60-day open comment period, which means the public can push for fewer restrictions \u2014 and that corporate America can ask for more. After Amazon employees demonstrated in favor of a a shareholder proposal related to climate change, Bezos announced a pledge to make Amazon carbon neutral by 2040.  (Jovelle Tamayo for CNN)Acting like an ownerAt Amazon's shareholder meeting, Cunningham wasn't the only one asking uncomfortable questions about climate change. During the Q&A session, when Bezos actually had come out on stage, another audience member asked why the company wasn't moving faster to reduce its carbon emissions. \"It's hard to find an issue that is more important than climate change. The science is super compelling on this, there's no doubt,\" Bezos said. \"There are a lot of initiatives underway, and we're not done. We'll think of more, we're very inventive.\" That kind of public commitment can re-order a company's priorities, changing environmental impact from a side concern to one that could pose a real risk to the company's stock price. In September, Amazon released an analysis of its carbon footprint \u2014 an effort that had been requested by three successive shareholder resolutions in the early 2010s \u2014 and the Amazon employees say they'll be back next year.For them, it's a way of literally living up to the company's \"leadership principles,\" which emphasize acting like an owner.\"Fighting climate change seems like ownership in spades,\" said Maren Costa, a member of the group who has worked at Amazon since 2002. Doing it through her stock portfolio, rather than simply internal pressure, \"was a real lightbulb for me,\" Costa said in an interview in May. \"I wish we'd been doing this forever.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Lamborghini doesn't just make supercars, it invented them. Certainly, there were fast, expensive cars before Lamborghini came along. But nothing was ever like a Lamborghini. The Italian automaker's creations were low to the ground and made to slip under the air. The engines were big and loud and sat right behind the two seats. The doors opened up into the air.The Countach defined not just Lamborghini, but all sorts of high-performance supercars. Now, the Italian automaker is taking on a new challenge: To develop a way to make supercars emissions-free, without using the lithium-ion batteries other automakers are relying on.Today's battery technology simply won't do, insists Maurizio Reggiani, chief technical officer at Lamborghini. Batteries are too heavy, too bulky and they can't perform at a high level for long enough. After a lap or two around a twisting race track at speeds reaching 160 miles per hour, where fast acceleration and hard braking are repeated over and over, a battery can begin to give out. Also, batteries are bulky and heavy and weight is the enemy of high performance.Lamborghini has been working with researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology since late 2017 on two possible solutions. One is a new form of battery made from carbon that can actually make up some of the internal body parts of the car so they don't add size or weight. The other is a different kind of energy storage altogether: a supercapacitor.Read MoreMaurizio Reggiani, Lamborghini's chief technical officer, doesn't think battery-driven supercars will perform at a high enough level.\"A supercapacitor with the same power is three times lighter than the normal lithium-ion battery,\" explained Reggiani. \"This is important because, in terms of packaging and in terms of weight, it gives me a big advantage in a super sports car.\"If you've ever walked on a shaggy wool carpet then gave someone an electric shock, you've acted as a capacitor. Your body stored up an electric charge and released it quickly. Ferrari and Lamborghini say 'Not so fast' on electric supercarsThe main advantage of supercapacitors is that they can deliver a bigger jolt of power, pound for pound, than batteries -- without heating up or degrading. That's great for supercars, where bursts of power and speed are needed.But today's supercapacitors aren't as good at storing energy as batteries. Supercapacitors have been used to power city buses that recharge at each stop. In the time it takes passengers to get on and off, the bus can charge enough to make it to the next stop and recharge again. That's not an ideal solution for a car, though.     Lamborghini and MIT are working to solve that problem. They announced this week that MIT researchers have invented a new material that could allow the creation of supercapacitors capable of holding two to three times as much energy as the supercapacitors now being produced. It's significant progress in just a couple of years, but that still puts the technology at about 20% the energy density -- or energy storage per unit of volume -- of lithium-ion batteries, said Riccardo Parenti, head of concept development at Lamborghini.It's an insane sounding technological long shot, but this technology could dramatically change the world of high performance cars --  if this team of university scientists and auto company engineers can figure it out.The standard bearerLamborghini has a proven track record when it comes to long shots, though. There are various stories about the beginnings of the company, most involving a dispute between founder Ferruccio Lamborghini and a haughty Enzo Ferrari, the founder of Ferrari. The gist of the tale is that Lamborghini, a Ferrari customer at the time, loved the way the cars drove but was dissatisfied with their durability and refinement. Based on his experience running his tractor company, Lamborghini had some suggestions as to how Ferrari could make his cars better. Ferrari, the stories go, told Lamborghini just where he could put his nice ideas.Lamborghini's founder, Ferruccio Lamborghini, decided to build his own cars. Previously, he ran a tractor company.   Undeterred, Lamborghini decided to make his own cars instead. He built a factory in Sant'Agata Bolognese, Italy, not terribly far from Ferrari's headquarters in Maranello. The company's first models, the Lamborghini 350GT and 400GT, were handsome, classically proportioned grand touring cars with long hoods and strong 12-cylinder engines. Then someone had a radical idea. It was the 1960s and the Ford GT40 race car was competing in the Le Mans 24-hour race. The car's design, with its big V8 engine mounted behind the seats, caught the attention of Lamborghini engineer Giancarlo Dallara.     \"'Why do we not make a car with a rear engine?,'\" Dallara recalled telling Lamborghini. \"And Mr. Lamborghini immediately said, 'Yes, do it!\"The Turin-based design firm Bertone and its new designer, Marcello Gandini, were chosen to come up with the body. The result was the beautiful Miura and it was a sensation. With the Miura, Lamborghini captured the world's attention. The Lamborghini Miura is still regarded as one of the most beautiful cars ever made.But it was Lamborghini's next supercar, the Countach, that would have an even bigger impact.The Countach's engine was mounted back-to-front instead of side-to-side. That meant the seats had to move even further forward, almost to the front wheels. That alone gave the car unique proportions. Gandini also gave the car a body covered in sharp, aggressive angles and lines.Bugatti: The rebirth of the world's fastest, most beautiful carsWhile the team worked on a mock up of the car, one very large and rough craftsman was astonished by what they were creating, Gandini told CNN Business. \"Countach!\" the man kept saying over and over as they worked, he recalled. At the time, in that part of Northern Italy, many people still spoke the local Piedmontese dialect. \"Countach\" was a mild curse word, the rough equivalent of \"damn!\" Gandini thought it would make a fine name for the car.Designer Marcello Gandini created the shapes of both the Miura and the Countach.Introduced in 1973, the first production version of the Countach, the LP400, wasn't the best -- its numerous flaws in performance and handling were addressed in later updates -- but it is still regarded as the best-looking version of the car.A nearly perfect double-pointed wedge, the Countach looked like it would chop through the air like a hatchet blade. The roof was so low that, instead of a rearview mirror it had a sort of periscope recessed into the roof allowing the driver to see behind the car. It was so wide that the doors couldn't open outwards so they swung upward.The Countach came to define not just Lamborghini -- almost every Lamborghini model since has had the Countach as an inspiration -- but all sorts of high-performance supercars. The Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n production line at the automaker's headquarters in Sant'Agata Bolognese, Italy.Lamborghini's new Aventador SVJ is very much a descendent of the Countach, with its V12 engine mounted roughly in the middle of the car. It relies on Lamborghini-invented technologies to harness the air flow over the car to improve cornering and acceleration. On a recent drive through mountain roads north of New York City, the Aventador SVJ felt glorious as it shifted gears through its seven-speed automatic transmission and whirled easily through turns at impossible-seeming speeds. But it also consumed a lot of high-octane gasoline. With concerns mounting about global warming and the industry shifting away from internal combustion engines that rely on burning hydrocarbons, Lamborghini knows future descendents of the Countach will need to radically change. A road less traveledBatteries, which power most electric cars today, would seem to be the logical solution for powering Lamborghini's next generation of supercars. Other automakers, including some closely related to Lamborghini, have had some success designing battery-powered supercars that can hit high speeds.Lamborghini's sister brand Volkswagen -- both companies are owned by the Volkswagen Group (VLKAF) -- recently set a lap record for an electric car on Germany's challenging Nurburgring race track with its ID.R electric race car. The same car had set the record for the fastest time ever by any car at the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb in Colorado.Lamborghini is working with researchers at MIT to power cars like the Terzo Millennio using carbon nanotubes and supercapacitors. Outside of Volkswagen, Rimac, a Croatian company, produces fully electric supercars costing millions of dollars with top speeds claimed to be well over 200 miles an hour. But, in terms of performance, its cars are more similar to a big, heavy Bugatti than a Lamborghini. They're fast when driven in a straight line, but aren't their best in sharp curves, founder Mate Rimac concedes.     Rimac admits that today's battery technology has serious limitations. But he believes many of the problems, such as overheating, will be solved eventually, he told CNN Business in an interview earlier this year. He just couldn't say when that might be -- just as Lamborghini can't say when supercapacitors might have energy storage capability to replace batteries or when smaller, lighter batteries could be incorporated into the car's body parts.Capacitors and their stronger siblings, supercapacitors, have been used for things like camera flashes and to power electric motors in industrial settings. A supercapacitor powered the starter motor in that Aventador SVJ I drove, but the car relied on its V12 engine to drive.The Lamborghini Si\u00e1n, a hybrid, uses a supercapacitor in addition to its V12 engine.As its next step, Lamborghini recently unveiled a hybrid supercar called the Si\u00e1n that uses a supercapacitor instead of batteries to store energy that's used to add power to the car's 12-cylinder engine.Just in case supercapacitor energy storage can't be improved enough, another lab at MIT is working on the new form of battery that could store energy in structural components of the car. These new batteries, made from carbon nanotubes, would free up all the space batteries usually take up. In 2017, Lamborghini unveiled the Terzo Millennio, a concept car that the company envisions would use both technologies, said Parenti, with the structural batteries storing energy and feeding it to improved supercapacitors.Reggiani won't say, yet, when he thinks a car like the Terzo Millennio might be possible. But as far as he's concerned, the usual approaches to making an electric car won't work for Lamborghini.\"The full electric vehicle, for us, must be like this,\" he said. \"Otherwise, it cannot be a Lamborghini.\"Correction: A photo caption in an earlier version of this story misidentified the model of the car on the production line at Lamborghini's headquarters.",

        "content": "Months after this summer's brief but brutal fried chicken sandwich battle, rivals are diligently plotting to win the longer war.Popeyes, which sparked the latest fight with its spicy chicken sandwich in August, is scrambling to bring back the viral sensation \"as soon as possible.\" Chick-fil-A is steadily growing its reach, outselling chicken chains nearly twice its size. And McDonald's franchise operators, who watched the fight from the sidelines, are pressuring their corporate boss to bring the crispy, breaded prize home. \"JFK called for a man on the moon,\" they wrote in a July letter. \"Our call should be a category leading chicken sandwich.\" Why all the hype over a fried cutlet on a bun? As visits to fast food restaurants stagnate, rivals are eyeing Chick-fil-A's runaway growth. The chain added about 1,000 locations and nearly tripled its sales over the last decade. With more than $10 billion in sales in 2018, the company has surpassed both Wendy's and Burger King to become the fifth largest fast food chain after McDonald's, Starbucks, Subway and Taco Bell.\"If you have the biggest share of a growing category, that is profits galore,\" said Michael Haracz, who until August served as McDonald's manager of culinary innovation. \"That is exponentially more sales, more buzz, more foot traffic to your restaurant.\" Read MoreMcDonald's, which says it is \"synonymous with burgers,\" has reason to worry: Beef consumption has fallen in the United States. Chicken is now the most popular meat by far. There will be \"clear winners,\" Haracz said, who will dominate the space and scoop up profits \u2014 as long as they can keep up with demand. Thirty-year food fightThough the fight over fried chicken was especially buzzy this summer, it was part of a dynamic that dates back at least 30 years.In 1989 McDonald's launched a national \"country-style\" McChicken sandwich and sparked a fight with Hardee's, then one of the largest fast food chains in the country. \"While McDonald`s is touting their new product, it isn't even comparable to our Chicken Fillet Sandwich, which has been on the market since 1979,\" Hardee's president said  at the time, according to a 1989 report from the Charlotte Observer. The newspaper published the story with the headline, \"Chicken sandwiches incite fast food war.\"\n\n\nOver the ensuing decades, fast food chains have launched and relaunched new iterations of the sandwich. McDonald's has had multiple versions, including premium and limited-time offerings. Within the last year alone, it's served the Ultimate Chicken Sandwich, the Mighty Chicken Sandwich, a spicy BBQ chicken sandwich and the McChicken.As companies experimented with chicken sandwiches, they occasionally caused a stir. In 2010, KFC made headlines with the Double Down \u2014 a limited-time-only cheese and bacon sandwich with two pieces of fried chicken where the bun should have been. (KFC briefly brought it back in 2014.) But even though items like the Double Down have gone viral, there may not have been anything quite like the frenzy that happened this summer, when Popeyes launched its national chicken sandwich.     People stood in line for hours for a chance to taste (and post photos of) the sandwich. Workers reportedly put in grueling hours as store operators scrambled to keep up with the surge in impatient customers.It wasn't that Popeyes wasn't expecting the sandwich to be a hit. It painstakingly researched what would work with customers, and eventually landed on the right combination \u2014 a buttermilk battered and breaded white meat filet, topped with pickles and a choice of mayo or a spicy Cajun spread and served on a toasted brioche bun. Popeyes called the sandwich the \"biggest product launch in the last 30 years.\" Felipe Athayde, president of the Americas at Popeyes, told the New York Times that the company had \"very aggressively forecasted\" demand, and expected to have sufficient supply through at least the end of September \u2014 about six weeks after its August 12 launch date. But stores throughout the country sold out of the sandwich within about two weeks. Many point to a Twitter exchange as the instigator. On August 19, one week after Popeyes sandwich hit stores, Chick-fil-A's official Twitter account posted a message: \"Bun + Chicken + Pickles = all the <3 for the original.\" Popeyes interpreted the message as a jab, retweeted the post and added \".... y'all good?\" ... y'all good? https://t.co/lPaTFXfnyP\u2014 Popeyes Chicken (@PopeyesChicken) August 19, 2019\n\nThe sassy response struck a nerve. It's racked up nearly 87,000 retweets and 324,000 likes, spawned memes and elicited innumerable cry-laugh emojis from social media users. Chick-fil-A didn't take the bait, but Wendy's stepped in and sparred with Popeyes on Twitter to the delight of onlookers. It's unlikely that the brand war would have made such a huge impact if Americans weren't already interested in fried chicken sandwiches.  \"There had always been fried chicken sandwiches,\" said Kara Nielsen, vice president of trends and marketing for CCD Innovation, a food and beverage consultancy. But she traces the current interest in the item to the 2008 financial crisis. \"One of the things that surged out of that recession moment was an interest in comfort food, as well as a lot of people opening food trucks, creating food stalls,\" she said. \"And so there were definitely a lot of fried chicken sandwiches coming out at that time. And it's never really stopped.\"And as fried chicken sandwiches gained local fans, a small, quirky chain was chugging steadily along. The rise of Chick-fil-AChick-fil-A traces its roots back to founder S. Truett Cathy's original diner, Dwarf Grill, which opened in 1946. Cathy opened the first Chick-fil-A in 1967, in the Greenbriar Shopping Center in Atlanta.For years, the company expanded primarily in shopping mall food courts. Then, in 1986, it opened its first standalone location in Atlanta. Today the chain operates more than 2,400 restaurants in 47 states and Washington, D.C. Other chicken chains are larger \u2014 Popeyes, for example, has more than 2,600 US restaurants and KFC has roughly 4,000. But Chick-fil-A outsells them.Chick-fil-A's first restaurant in Atlanta's Greenbriar Mall in the late 1960s.Ranked by annual revenue, Chick-fil-A is the fifth largest US restaurant chain after McDonald's, Starbucks, Subway and Taco Bell \u2014 all of which have far more stores. Chick-fil-A's individual stores are more productive than any of its bigger competitors. They pulled in an average of $4.4 million in 2018, well above unit sales at McDonald's or Starbucks, according to Technomic, a company that specializes in research on the food industry. The chain is also, according to polls and surveys, beloved. An Axios Harris Poll published in March found that Chick-fil-A had the best reputation among US adults compared to Starbucks, Yum! Brands (which owns KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell), Chipotle, Papa John's and McDonald's. And for the past four years in a row, US teens surveyed by Piper Jaffray said Chick-fil-A was their favorite restaurant.      Customer service and food quality help explain Chick-fil-A's success. But it also has a commercially important X-factor: authenticity. R.J. Hottovy, an analyst who covers food for Morningstar, said that in recent years, companies that have specialized in a particular product and appear more authentic tend to do better than those that try to appeal to everyone.Chick-fil-A scores high on authenticity. It has stuck to Christian roots by keeping stores closed on Sundays, for example. But that conservative tradition has also earned backlash. In 2012 CEO Dan Cathy said he opposed gay marriage on religious grounds. That year the company was also criticized for donations made by the WinShape Foundation, which was started by founder Truett Cathy and financed largely by Chick-fil-A profits, to groups some characterized as anti-gay.  Chick-fil-A says that is has \"no political or social agenda,\" and that \"everyone is welcome in our restaurants.\" Still, new stores have been met with protests. Some fans of fried chicken sandwiches may welcome an offering from a purveyor they see as more politically neutral, like Popeyes. Nevertheless, Chick-fil-A has grown at a steady clip and picked up those devoted followers. \"There's so many people now who have an understanding or a notion of what Chick-fil-A is, even if they never eat there or if they've never seen one,\" Nielsen noted. \"It's become a bit of this mythical thing, and clearly millennials have found it, and found that it fits their bill.\"As Chick-fil-A locations pop up in more cities, more people rush to test out their sandwiches. That's helped boost fried chicken sandwich sales \u2014 and gotten other fast food chains to pay attention. \"This fried chicken trend keeps evolving because companies like Chick-fil-A expand their reach,\" Nielsen said. While Chick-fil-A creeps across the nation, one group in particular is trying to defend its territory. McDonald's franchise operators are calling for reinforcements. A McMissionOn July 10 \u2014 a month before Popeyes launched its sandwich \u2014 the board of the National Owners Association, a group of McDonald's franchisees that formed in 2018, sent out a strongly-worded letter to its members. \"We are finding ways to drive profitable growth,\" the board wrote. \"Yet, we are still losing guest counts. This continues to be a concern.\" One reason for the loss, the board argued, is that customers craving a delicious fried chicken sandwich aren't going to McDonald's. They're going to Chick-fil-A. \"A favorite, that our customers want, is a chicken sandwich. Unfortunately, they have to go to Chick-fil-A for it,\" the board said. \"Chick-fil-A's results demonstrate the power of chicken. Yes, we have great Chicken McNuggets and our McChicken is a very good product. But we do not compete in the premium chicken sandwich category, either grilled or crispy.\"The letter continued with a warning: \"Our US Southeast markets' results should concern everyone. You may not have Chick-fil-A's in your market or to the degree they have them in the southeast, but they are coming. And they don't discount.\" McDonald's knows how to make chicken into a hit. In the early 1980s, around the time Americans first started losing interest in beef, McDonald's founder Ray Kroc wanted to add a chicken entree to the menu. The company's initial attempts, like a deep fried chicken pot pie, didn't resonate with customers. But eventually, McDonald's landed on a winner: Chicken McNuggets, which launched in 1983, were so successful that by 1985 the chain had become the second-largest chicken seller in the fast food space behind KFC.\"Chicken has been on the radar for quite a while at McDonald's,\" Haracz said. \"There's a variety of chicken sandwiches being tested.\"In the third quarter of 2019, traffic at US McDonald's restaurants was down. During an October call discussing the earnings, one analyst wondered whether McDonald's lost sales because it sat out the great chicken sandwich war.      \"I think it's fair to assume with everything going on in the quarter with chicken that we would go a little bit the opposite way on chicken. So I think that's a fair conclusion,\" answered Kevin Ozan, the company's chief financial officer. For now, McDonald's is keeping its plans close to the vest. The company declined to tell CNN Business when it expects to launch its next chicken sandwich, but noted, \"We are inspired by the customer demand for premium chicken sandwiches, and are working closely with our franchisees to deliver what our customers want. Stay tuned.\" A source close to the conversation between the owners and McDonald's leadership said a premium chicken sandwich may start rolling out as soon as this year. But while McDonald's tinkers and focuses on other areas of the business, its franchise owners have been getting impatient. In late August, after Popeyes' massively successful launch, Blake Casper, NOA's director, sent out another somber note. \"It was a busy week, especially if you work at Popeyes,\" he wrote. \"Popeyes came out with a chicken sandwich that rivals Chick-fil-A. It's the first time Chick-fil-A has blinked, or more accurately, was forced to blink. But make no mistake, they blinked. Wendy's got into the action and unfortunately, we're still not in the game.\" But, Casper continued, it's not over yet. \"That is going to change. We are working on a chicken sandwich that will compete. We will be in the game. People will tire of the service at Popeyes and they want an alternative to Chick-fil-A,\" he said. \"They want a chicken sandwich at McDonald's. We are going to give it to them.\"",

        "content": "At the back of Costco's stores, past the televisions, jewelry, jumbo-sized ketchup jugs and tubs of mixed nuts, is one of the retailer's most prized items: The rotisserie chicken that costs just $4.99. Cheap Kirkland Signature rotisserie chickens aren't only a quick way for families to get dinner on the table. For Costco, the chickens are a lure, pulling customers into stores and getting them to browse the aisles, adding sometimes hundreds of dollars worth of items to their shopping carts before they pick up that bird.The chickens have become almost a cult item. 91 million were sold last year, double the number from a decade earlier. They have their own Facebook page with nearly 13,000 followers.So Costco is willing to go to extreme lengths to keep its chickens at $4.99. For the past few years, it's been recruiting farmers for this moment: The official opening of a sprawling, $450 million poultry complex of its very own in Nebraska.It's a highly unusual move for one of the world's largest retailers. Costco will control the production process from farm to store, making key decisions down to the grain chickens eat and the type of eggs hatched. Costco has even put its socially-conscious corporate reputation on the line, fending off local critics who have rallied against the Nebraska operation.Read MoreThis is a big experiment not only for Costco, but the broader industry as well. Retailers will be watching Costco's plan closely. It's one of the largest-scale tests of a store's ability to become its own meat supplier. And there's no guarantee it will work.Costco's $4.99 birds. The company sold more than 90 million rotisserie chickens last year.The 'inexorable rise of chicken'Costco is so determined to keep its rotisserie chickens at $4.99 that it's been willing to lose money selling them in the past. Even as competitors increased their rotisserie chickens to $5.99 in recent years, Costco held its price steady.\"As prices changed dramatically and we saw the competition raising the price, it was a hot price,\" Costco's chief financial officer Richard Galanti said in 2014. Costco was willing to sacrifice \"$30 million, $40 million a year on gross margin by keeping it at $4.99,\" Galanti said the following year. \"That is what we do for a living.\"Jeff Lyons, senior vice president of fresh foods at Costco, who joined the company in 1990 as its first meat buyer, declined to say whether Costco still loses money selling them. But rotisserie chickens have been a \"very, very good business and very consistent growth for a long period of time,\" he said. \"We're right about 100 million right now.\"But in recent years, it has become even more difficult for Costco to keep its rotisserie chicken prices down. Americans are eating more chicken than ever before, and the company faces supply challenges and cost pressures in the highly concentrated poultry industry.\n\nA small number of massive producers dominate America's chicken supply: Tyson, Pilgrim's Pride, Sanderson Farms, Perdue and Koch Foods. Together, those companies control more than 60% of America's $65 billion poultry market, according to Watt Poultry, a meat industry publication.\"A more consolidated industry has more bargaining power against its customers,\" said Timothy Ramey, a longtime poultry industry analyst. Costco wants to reduce its reliance on those big producers.Traditional chicken suppliers are also producing fewer birds to be sold as rotisserie chickens.An estimated 15% of chickens today are sold as whole birds, down from around 50% of all poultry in the 1980s, according to the Department of Agriculture. Instead, they are chopped up into breasts, legs, thighs, chicken nuggets and wings to feed Americans' insatiable appetite for chicken at grocery stores and fast-food restaurants.\"Make no mistake: Consumers want cheap Walmart chicken,\" said Ramey. \"That explains the inexorable rise of chicken.\"As the number of full-sized birds in production drops, bird weights are going up to keep up with demand. Companies like Tyson Foods can make a higher profit by cutting up and skinning heavier chickens and selling their parts.Bird weights are expected to continue rising, presenting a problem for Costco. Costco needs birds around six pounds to cook in stores.\"We were having trouble getting the size bird we wanted on a consistent basis,\" said Lyons from Costco. \"We couldn't take a seven-pound bird or an eight-pound bird and make it work. They're too big. They wouldn't even fit on our rotisserie line.\"Bird sizes are growing to feed demand for chicken.Chicken operations in NebraskaThat's why Costco is seizing control of its chicken supply chain. Costco believes it can slash costs by bringing production in house, saving up to 35 cents per bird.It has already done the same with hot dogs.Costco sold kosher hot dogs at food courts until 2009, but suppliers started to run low on beef. So it brought production in-house and switched to its own Kirkland Signature-brand hot dogs. Costco now produces 285 million hot dogs at a plant in California.Costco picked Nebraska for the poultry plant because the area had grain, water and labor available. Those are the three biggest costs involved with chicken production.How Kirkland Signature powers Costco's successAlthough Nebraska is not known for chicken production, corn prices have fallen in recent years, leading to interest from farmers looking for new opportunities. The United States' trade war with China has also taken a toll on farmers.\"We had to have farmers who were willing to grow for us, and we found overwhelming support,\" Walt Shafer, a veteran Pilgrim's Pride executive overseeing Costco's operations in Nebraska, said in a recent interview. \"These grain farmers out here want to diversify.\" The retailer is building a poultry complex in Fremont, Nebraska, a farming town near the Iowa border. The complex includes a processing facility, hatchery and feed mill.The nearly 400,000 square-foot plant in Fremont will employ 950 workers. The plant will take 45 weeks to ramp up to full production. Once it's at full speed, the plant will process about 100 million chickens a year, or 40% of Costco's annual chicken needs. Costco will process around two million birds a week in Nebraska to supply to stores on the West Coast.Costco's nearly 400,000 square-foot processing plant in Fremont, Nebraska will eventually process about 100 million chickens a year.Costco is partnering with Nebraska farmers to raise breeder hens to lay eggs. Those eggs will then go into hatcheries, and the chicks will be delivered to Nebraska growers. The chicks will grow for around 42 days in hundreds of specialized barns in the area until they mature into six-pound broilers \u2014chickens raised specifically for their meat. Then they're off to the processing plant.If the Costco plant is successful, other major food retailers will likely make a business case for bringing animal protein needs in-house.\"\tWill Sawyer, animal protein economist at CoBankThere are few examples of retailers vertically integrating in the agricultural industry like this, experts say. Walmart is seizing control of part of its Angus beef supply chain, and both Walmart and Kroger have integrated their milk supplies. But none are as sweeping as Costco's operations in Nebraska.  \"Costco's poultry complex is more than just a multi-million dollar experiment from a retailer known for doing things differently,\" said Will Sawyer, an animal protein economist at CoBank, a leading agriculture lender. \"If the Costco plant is successful, other major food retailers will likely make a business case for bringing animal protein needs in-house.\" Contract concerns$4.99 broilers come at a price beyond Costco's bottom line. Costco has billed itself as a socially responsible and worker-friendly company, even earning praise and a store visit from then-President Barack Obama for raising its minimum wage in 2014.But by getting into the chicken business, it's wading into a controversial industry with many skeptics, including some who come from Costco's customer base. Its poultry farm ambitions have sparked backlash among environmentalists and farmers' advocates in the Fremont area.Opponents of the plant in Fremont like Randy Ruppert, a local activist, worry about the environmental impact of the plant and poultry barns, such as water contamination from runoff, ammonia from chicken feces and other health risks. In neighboring Iowa, poultry operations have been linked to high levels of nitrates in tap water. \"They are bringing degenerative farming to Nebraska, nothing else,\" said Ruppert, who formed a nonprofit group, Nebraska Communities United, that has led resistance to the company. Critics packed local town halls to voice concerns and put up anti-Costco signs in the area. Some residents in Fremont and surrounding towns oppose Costco entering Nebraska.The poultry industry has also come under heavy scrutiny for offering unfair contracts to chicken farmers. Around 90% of broilers in the United States are raised under contracts with farmers. Under the contract system, farmers build the barns and invest in their upkeep, while larger companies supply them with chicks and feed.Grain farmers in Nebraska, who previously farmed corn and soybeans, are investing $350 million collectively and building barns to raise chickens. Most of the farmers had not previously grown chickens, so Costco is responsible for educating and leading the farmers.Costco claims that it's setting a \"new and improved standard\" for industry contracts. \"Our contract, we think, has one of the best pay rates in the industry,\" Shafer said in the interview.Opponents, however, argue that Costco's 15-year contracts are a risky investment for farmers.They are bringing degenerative farming to Nebraska \u2014 nothing else.\"Randy Ruppert, founder of Nebraska Communities United\"We all hoped that Costco was going to present the opportunity to start to build a better system for poultry,\" said Lynn Hayes, an attorney at Farmers' Legal Action Group, a nonprofit group that provides legal services to farmers.But the contracts are a \"letdown,\" she said. \"It's still far from good enough to justify the kind of investments that farmers have to put into it\" because their barns can't be repurposed for other uses if their operations disappoint.Robert Taylor, a professor emeritus of agricultural economics at Auburn University and a longtime critic of the poultry industry, blasted Costco's contracts. \"This particular form of contract agriculture essentially makes the farmer an indentured servant,\" he said. \"The farmer is basically reduced to a chicken house janitor.\" Taylor argued that Costco growers' annual income for chicken farming will come out to around $60,000 after labor expenses. That's a lot less than the $90,000 to $130,000 Costco says farmers will bring home in pay.Costco's secret weapon: Food courts and $1.50 hot dogsCostco pushed back on these charges.Shafer, the executive leading poultry operations in Nebraska for Costco, said \"we have one of the lowest risk poultry contracts available\" because Costco's poultry business keep growing every year.\"I have no doubt that Costco will continue to do the right thing by our growers for the next 15 years and beyond,\" he said.Despite a contentious response and the high costs of pushing into the poultry industry, Costco remains confident that the Nebraska experiment is key to its growth. \"We know that we're going to be in poultry. We see the future,\" said Costco's Lyons. \"We're always working five to 10 years out front.\"",

The buzzy startups have been growing rapidly, with orders pouring in from Burger King, Dunkin', Subway and Sodexo, which counts university and corporate cafeterias among its customers.Like many young companies, Beyond and Impossible have struggled, as well. Impossible faced shortages, reassigning employees from its corporate office to its refrigerated warehouse to help meet demand (the shortages, it says, are over). Beyond had a wildly successful IPO and has since held a secondary offering, but its losses remain steep, and experts fear the inflated stock price may be a sign of a bubble. Impossible is private and doesn't disclose financial information.The Awesome Burger is designed to look, cook and taste like real meat. Nestl\u00e9, on the other hand, is the largest food company in the world, according to Forbes. It has about 140 years on Beyond and Impossible. Its breathtaking scale dwarfs Impossible and Beyond: The Swiss company employs 308,000 people, rakes in tens of billions of dollars in annual sales, has offices in countries around the world and owns a wide variety of well-established brands, including Dreyer's and H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream, Toll House chocolate chips and cookie dough, Gerber baby food, DiGiorno frozen pizza, Lean Cuisine, Stouffer's and more. Sweet Earth has already benefited from that scale: While under Nestl\u00e9's umbrella, it has rolled out frozen pizzas, empanadas and new entrees. Nestl\u00e9 is a master of supply chains and a profit machine, unlike its younger competitors. Its relationships and its broad product platform mean that Nestl\u00e9 can ensure the Awesome Burger will, in some form or another, be everywhere \u2014 in restaurants, on grocery shelves and incorporated into frozen meals. Nestl\u00e9 is already partnering with McDonald's on vegan patties in Europe \u2014 if that relationship extends to the United States, the Awesome Burger could be in the biggest burger chain in America. McDonald's, for its part, has said that it is still deciding whether to serve a meatless (but meatlike) burger in the United States. And through Sweet Earth, Nestl\u00e9 is also launching a line of plant-based deli meats, including turkey, ham, salami and sausage, this spring. The products will be sold in a dedicated, branded deli counter as well as on shelves. Tucker Bunch, culinary innovation and development chef at Sweet Earth, prepares food in the office's test kitchen. Nestl\u00e9 is not the only major food company angling for a piece of the plant-based pie. Kellogg plans to launch a line of meat substitutes called Incogmeato under its Morningstar Farms brand next year. Kroger is introducing its own plant-based products, from burger patties to Bolognese sauce to sour cream, this fall. Hormel Foods, maker of Skippy, Spam and AppleGate, has also introduced a line of plant-based and blended products, as has Tyson, one of the world's biggest meat, pork and poultry processors. Big Food launching plant-based products is \"literally the best thing that could happen for the sector,\" said Bruce Friedrich, executive director of the Good Food Institute, a nonprofit that supports plant-based businesses. \"When the biggest food and meat companies in the world are launching plant-based meat products, that will do more to mainstream plant-based meats and to make the pie significantly bigger than probably anything else.\" By partnering with fast-food companies and selling in retail, Impossible and Beyond are making plant-based foods available to many consumers. But \"there's a difference between 'able to get' and mainstream,\" Friedrich added. \"It's about omnipresence.\" When the biggest food and meat companies in the world are launching plant-based meat products, that will do more to mainstream plant-based meats and to make the pie significantly bigger than probably anything else.\" Bruce Friedrich, executive director of the Good Food InstituteOnce all the new products hit shelves, consumers will be able to take their pick \u2014 they'll make choices based on ingredients, taste, nutritional profile and packaging. If the trend develops, it'll give Big Food a chance to compete in a new and lucrative space. But if plant-based meat proves to be a fad and phases out, it could mean the loss of millions of dollars for big companies who made a bad bet. But Nestl\u00e9 thinks plant-based protein is here to stay. And it's banking on Sweet Earth to put it at the front of the pack. The Awesome Burger in all its glory. How vegetables became sexy  It may seem like the plant-based trend came out of nowhere, but vegetarian products have been around for decades. Veggie burgers started hitting grocery shelves about 30 years ago. Gardenburger, which makes burgers primarily out of vegetables and grains, was founded in 1985. Slowly, the market expanded. Dr. Praeger's, which also makes veggie burgers, launched in 1992. Tofurky debuted its holiday roast in 1995. It took about another 15 years for mainstream eaters to start paying attention. Several factors led to popular interest in plant-based foods, noted Kara Nielsen, vice president of trends and marketing for CCD Innovation, a food and beverage innovation consultancy. \"When we look back and look [at] what were the steps that preceded this, there were quite a few. Including vegetables becoming really sexy and interesting,\" Nielsen said. When we look back and look [at] what were the steps that preceded this, there were quite a few. Including vegetables becoming really sexy and interesting.\" Kara Nielsen, vice president of trends and marketing for CCD InnovationThings started turning around for vegetables around 2010, according to Nielsen. That year, President Bill Clinton started talking openly about his decision to go (mostly) vegan as a way to manage his health. Plenty, a best-selling vegetarian cookbook that New York Times food writer Mark Bittman called \"among the most generous and luxurious nonmeat cookbooks ever produced,\" hit shelves. Soon, the plant-based diet was luring celebrities like Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9, who pledged in 2013 to give being vegan a try. Bill Gates, who invested in Beyond Meat, raved about the company in a 2013 blog post. Suddenly, veganism wasn't a fringe category dominated by lentils and activists. It was a lifestyle embraced by the powerful and famous \u2014 and it was drawing interest from influential, wealthy investors. As plant-based diets were becoming more popular, other changes were hitting the food sector. Big food companies like Nestl\u00e9 and Kellogg used to be able to set the tone when it came to food trends, launching new products or line extensions without much competition from upstarts. But the food business has become more fragmented. Young companies can crowdfund to launch products and use online retailers to sell them, reaching an audience quickly and without the use of traditional channels like established grocery stores. The bustling space has also started to attract more funding: Research firm CB Insights found that between 2013 and 2017, the number of investors \u2014 including venture capitalists, private equity firms and others \u2014 pouring funds into food and beverage startups has more than tripled. Pea protein is a key ingredient in Sweet Earth's plant-based Awesome Burger. To compete, big consumer packaged goods firms have launched their own venture arms and accelerators to help them identify new acquisition targets or give them a view into what people want to eat. Still, large companies have nearly missed the boat on some new trends, said Nielsen. For example, big brands were slow to launch non-GMO or gluten-free products. Nestl\u00e9, Kellogg, Kroger and the other big companies chasing Impossible and Beyond don't want to be left out of the plant-based trend, which is particularly attractive. As increasingly health-conscious consumers turn away from processed, sugary foods, it fits neatly into the health and wellness space big companies are trying to build out. And it has the added bonus of signaling and supporting sustainability efforts. When Nestl\u00e9 announced plans to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, it said it would bring plant-based products to market as part of the effort. Plant-based alternatives to meat use significantly less water and release far fewer emissions than animal products. Plus, plant-based products appeal to several demographics: Aging consumers who want to reduce their meat intake for health reasons, Millennials who worry about the warming planet and even younger consumers who may be primarily concerned with animal rights. And, potentially, there's lots of money to be made. US retail sales of plant-based foods have grown 11% in the past year, according to a July report from trade group Plant Based Foods Association and the Good Food Institute. Barclays predicts the alternative meat sector could reach about $140 billion in sales over the next decade, capturing about 10% of the global meat industry. Jefferies predicts that by 2040, the alternative meat market could make $240 billion in annual revenue globally. For companies that want to grow while presenting themselves as pro-health, pro-environment and generally with it, the plant-based trend seems like a slam dunk.For Nestl\u00e9, there were a few possible ways into the meat substitute trend. Last year, it started selling vegetarian meals through Lean Cuisine. In Europe, it has a line of plant-based products under its Garden Gourmet brand. The company could have launched the Awesome Burger under those brands, or cooked something up from scratch. Instead, it bought Sweet Earth. The Sweet Earth gambit Sweet Earth may just seem like a mom and pop operation that was in the right place at the right time \u2014 a humble maker of frozen veggie burritos and imitation bacon that lucked out when Nestl\u00e9 decided to hop on a new trend. Its offices, with open cubicles and windows that frame the pale California sky or let workers peer into the factory on the main floor, lack Nestl\u00e9 branding. Sweet Earth's mascot, a farmer seated in a Lotus-like position, can be spotted throughout the office, in a small painting by the elevator and on a wall-mounted gong. Employees have access to fruit and vegetables from a backyard community garden, and can kick their feet up on a tree stump ottoman in a sun-drenched meeting room. But as non-corporate as it seems, the operation was launched by a business-savvy couple with years of experience selling big brands. Kelly and Brian Swette, who started the company in 2011, each have a background in marketing. Both spent years at PepsiCo, Brian as chief marketing officer and Kelly as a brand manager and director of marketing for the Pepsi brand. Brian also was the director of Jamba Juice, sat on the Burger King board, and was a brand manager for Procter & Gamble. Kelly was the global vice president of marketing at Calvin Klein. Sweet Earth CEO Kelly Swette in the employee garden at Sweet Earth's headquarters.The Swettes each had their own reasons for wanting to start a vegetarian meal company. In 2004, the couple's teen daughter Briana started keeping a vegetarian diet because she was concerned about the environment and animal welfare. Kelly, responsible for the household cooking, looked for quick, easy, appetizing plant-based foods and found the options lacking. Meanwhile Brian, who helped start Arizona State University's Global Institute of Sustainability in 2002, noticed that food played too small of a role in the sustainability movement. Both saw an opportunity. \"We thought there was a marketplace,\" Brian noted. \"It was pretty clear to me as you'd talk to young people, saw their behaviors and you saw the menus change, that there was a desire for delicious and nutritious food that was plant-based.\" Sweet Earth quickly started getting attention from industry experts. Trade publications handed out accolades, highlighting the company's frozen burritos, fake bacon and veggie burritos in best-of lists. Kelly Swette, who remains Sweet Earth's CEO (Brian is president) also started receiving attention \u2014 in 2015, Goldman Sachs called her one of the 100 most intriguing entrepreneurs of the year. It was pretty clear to me as you'd talk to young people, saw their behaviors and you saw the menus change, that there was a desire for delicious and nutritious food that was plant-based.\"Brian Swette, President, Sweet EarthTwo years later \u2014 right around the time Sweet Earth started thinking about launching a meatless burger that looks and tastes like meat \u2014 Nestl\u00e9 acquired the business. It didn't disclose the financial terms of the deal. \"More and more consumers [were] interested in eating plant-based, but in a more familiar way,\" Kelly recalled. After the acquisition, with access to Nestl\u00e9's huge R&D capabilities, Sweet Earth was able to speed up development of the Awesome Burger. That was good news for Nestl\u00e9. The Sweet Earth acquisition \"gives us a lot of speed to market,\" said John Carmichael, president of Nestl\u00e9 USA's food division. \"They've been at this for multiple years now,\" he said. The deal \"gives both of us a jumpstart on a market that's maturing as we speak.\"  Nestl\u00e9's Awesome Burger started shipping out to grocery stores weeks before the Impossible Burger got to retail for the first time. Kroger's collection is also reaching shelves this fall. A whole world of choice is opening up to consumers who want to test out \u2014 or fully buy into \u2014 meat substitutes. It's a new but already crowded market, and each brand will have to set itself apart. When my colleagues and I tried the Awesome Burger in Sweet Earth's test kitchen, it tasted good \u2014 but it didn't taste exactly like meat.Sweet Earth produces poultry alternative Mindful Chik'n and meat substitutes Awesome Grounds and the Awesome Burger. The Awesome Burger is made out of pea protein, coconut oil, wheat gluten and canola oil, among other ingredients. Beyond Meat also lists pea protein, canola oil and coconut oil among its main ingredients. Impossible, on the other hand, uses soy protein, coconut oil and sunflower oil, in addition to other things. Nutritionally, the Awesome Burger looks a little different. An Awesome Burger has 260 calories, 26 grams of protein, six grams of fiber and 15 grams of fat per each four-ounce serving. An Impossible Burger of the same size has 240 calories, 19 grams of protein, three grams of fiber and 14 grams of fat, and a four-ounce Beyond Meat burger has 250 calories, 20 grams of protein, two grams of fiber and 18 grams of fat.      A four-ounce serving of real ground beef, made of 80% lean meat and 20% fat, has about 290 calories, 19 grams of protein, zero fiber and 23 grams of fat, according to the USDA. The Awesome Burger's relatively high protein and fiber count is by design, said Kelly Swette, noting that those factors could help set it apart from the competition. That aside, the Awesome Burger looks a lot like the Impossible Burger, down to the branded toothpick stuck into the bun when served to customers (or at least, to us). As the market grows and more meat-like products with cheeky names hit shelves, consumers might mistake one product for the other \u2014 or they might reach for brands they've been hearing about for years, like Beyond Meat and Impossible.  The space is \"superlative-laden, I would say, in terms of the naming,\" Brian Swette conceded. But \"our intent is to leverage\" the Sweet Earth brand, he said. \"There will be some marketing and distribution wars that will take place.\" There will be some marketing and distribution wars that will take place.\" Brian Swette, president, Sweet EarthCarmichael thinks that Sweet Earth's credentials as an established vegetarian food company will also help set it apart from competitors. Some, like Friedrich of the Good Food Institute, think it's a mistake to look at the plant-based sector as zero-sum. Entrants into the space won't steal share from each other, Friedrich said, but help expand the sector. But that doesn't mean every brand will do well. Kara Nielsen pointed to the low-calorie ice cream trend fueled by Halo Top as an example of how the plant-based trend could play out. \"Everybody wants to have one, and there's not going to be enough room,\" she said. \"One will be the victor.\" The Awesome Burger should be \"pink to warm-red\" in the middle when done, according to the patty's package. And as the plant-based market heats up, a backlash could be brewing. Customers interested in unprocessed foods, like whole grains, beans and vegetables, may turn away from the product when they realize that, like any other burger, it's prepared in a factory. \"Most consumers are not aware of how these products are actually put together,\" said Darren Seifer, food and beverage industry analyst for research group NPD. \"Right now it's about the plant-based part of it. They figure, it's a plant, and it's a bunch of plants put together. Beyond that I would say that there's still some confusion.\" Nestl\u00e9 itself may face its own challenges. Because it sells bottled water, it's been accused of making money off of precious public resources. Nestl\u00e9 says it is \"committed to continuing to conserve and protect water resources in the areas where we operate\" and set up a web page responding to concerns about its water usage in California after activists tried to prevent Nestl\u00e9 from withdrawing water in the state. The company has also been criticized as a contributor to plastic pollution. In response, it's committed to make all of its packaging recycling or reusable by 2025 and to reduce single-use plastics by testing out reusable packaging and other innovations. Plus, allegations of animal cruelty at a Nestl\u00e9 supplier put the company in the spotlight this year (Nestl\u00e9 has cut ties with the farm in question, and says it has been working with its dairy suppliers to develop a program supporting improvements, including in animal care). \"In our community, Nestl\u00e9 has had a bit of pushback,\" said Anna Starostinetskaya, senior editor at VegNews, a vegan lifestyle brand with a news website and magazine. \"But because Sweet Earth has been a pretty beloved company ... some vegans might be attracted to it.\" Kelly Swette said she's not concerned that Sweet Earth's association with Nestl\u00e9 could drive away vegan or vegeterian customers. \"Our values and mission are supported by Nestl\u00e9,\" she said. \"Together we are stronger.\" Paul Mankowski, head of research and development for Nestl\u00e9 Foods, said that selling affordable vegan food is \"an opportunity to get more plant-based products in consumers' hands.\"Paul Mankowski, head of research and development for Nestl\u00e9 Foods, and Kelly Swette showcase products in the test kitchen at Sweet Earth. Environmentally conscious consumers may warm to Nestl\u00e9 because of its efforts in the plant-based space \u2014 but they may decide to go with a company they see as less controversial. Some, perhaps most, customers may not even realize that there's a connection between Sweet Earth and Nestl\u00e9. The Awesome Burger package features Sweet Earth's name and logo prominently, but doesn't mention its parent company. Nestl\u00e9 says it is committed to the plant-based sector. It says plant-based products are an important, growing part of its business, a trend that's here to stay. But decades of experience means that Nestl\u00e9 has seen fads come and go, and knows how to exit when it needs to. For example, the company is distancing itself from candy, which was for years a key part of its business. Last year it sold off US candy, including Butterfinger, Crunch, Raisinets, Nerds, Laffy Taffy and others to Ferrero in a $2.8 billion deal. \"This move allows Nestl\u00e9 to invest and innovate across a range of categories where we see strong future growth,\" Nestl\u00e9 CEO Mark Schneider said in a statement at the time.\"We've lived through trends and we understand how to deal with trends,\" noted Mankowski. \"We are well-positioned to drive into trends and to pivot when new trends come.\"There are some signs that not every market has a voracious appetite for plant-based products. Tim Hortons launched Beyond Meat as a limited menu item across Canada in June, and has since said that it will continue the test just in British Columbia and Ontario because of the \"positive guest response.\" After a limited retail test in the United Kingdom, Nestl\u00e9 pulled its Garden Gourmet line from shelves in that market, saying that it \"was received very positively,\" and that it's planning to return to the region. Brian Swette says he's not worried about the Awesome Burger or other Sweet Earth products being offloaded by Nestl\u00e9. \"We're supervising, along with Nestl\u00e9, the formulation of the product, and the making of the product and the distribution of it. I'm very confident on all three aspects,\" he said. \"That's not going to happen to us.\"",

        "content": "Self-driving cars. Robotic surgeries. Toothbrushes that detect when you're sick. This is the future 5G technology promises in less than a decade's time; internet connections so fast they'll support an entirely new way of life.But for now, I'm standing on an avenue in downtown Chicago waving my Samsung Galaxy 5G smartphone around to find coverage that's not blocked by the tree to my left. I finally take a few steps back from the lamppost, adorned by a hard-to-miss, clunky black antenna, and bam, my Netflix download begins: a complete download of a two-hour film in less than 10 seconds \u2014 in stark contrast to the seven-or-so minutes it'd typically take on 4G. This was my experience testing the newly launched Verizon 5G network in Chicago last month. When it worked, it really worked, often hitting over 1 gigabit per second in speed tests \u2014 an incredible feat for a piece of technology that fits in your pocket. 4G LTE in the United States averages about 35 megabits per second. 5G, the fifth generation of cellular network technology, is nearly 30 times faster \u2014 and about 10 times faster than the average American home broadband speed. Read MoreBut 5G isn't just about speeds on smartphones. Other technologies will be made possible with its ability to handle much more bandwidth, allowing the data from sensors, thermostats, cars and robots to work together in real time.Samantha Kelly, CNN Business tech editor, tested 5G networks in New York (pictured here), Chicago and Dallas.Think of it like this: If 3G is a two-lane highway and 4G is six lanes, 5G will turn it into 12 lanes. It'll handle significantly more traffic and bandwidth with zero latency, a word that refers to immediate response times for data transfers \u2014 will allow self-driving cars to process all the information they need to make life-or-death decisions in the blink of an eye, or the health care industry to help power the next generation of telemedicine and robotic surgeries. (A surgeon in China recently conducted a liver transplant on an animal from a location 30 miles away by controlling a robotic arm running on 5G. The same procedure on a 4G network would have increased the chance for mistakes). Mobile carriers are pouring billions of dollars into 5G. The new networks and associated technologies are expected to add $17 trillion to the global GDP by 2035, according to ABI Research. But there will be a significant lag between 5G's rollout and that financial impact. It's not dissimilar to the 3G iPhone \u2014 an impressive piece of standalone technology that didn't make a big economic impact until a year later with the arrival of the App Store. A few years after that, 4G paved the way for on-demand apps such as Uber, mobile video consumption on Netflix and FaceTime, real-time rerouting via Google Maps and social sharing on Instagram and Snapchat.We've maxed out the 4G capabilities of what our phones can do, but 5G could offer a doorway into what's next. However, carriers have a long way to go before they deliver on that promise.     My 5G network tests, often performed via the Speedtest app, were inconsistent. If I turned a street corner on Verizon, 5G went out of range \u2014 a major drawback to the high-frequency spectrum approach being adopted by some carriers. That technology delivers lightning-fast speeds but doesn't cover wide areas, penetrate indoors and can be blocked by rain or, in my case, leaves. Inside a Verizon store on Michigan Avenue, I looked out at the cellular radio equipment hanging on another lamppost 20 feet away, unable to get on the network from the other side of the glass window. It poetically captured the current state of 5G: The future was staring right at me but I couldn't quite access it. Rollout bluesVerizon was my first experience with 5G: I've since tested the networks for Sprint, T-Mobile and AT&T, CNN's parent company. Each provided a different experience. My speed tests on AT&T dominated, reaching an impressive 1.6 Gbps in a Dallas park and downloading \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse\" in 5 seconds. (Think of all the movies you could download in the 60 seconds you have on the tarmac before a flight takes off.)\n\n\n\n\nI also tried Sprint, which uses a lower frequency for its 5G network, in Chicago. It was the most consistent in terms of coverage \u2014 I was able to duck into a Starbucks, turn street corners and hop into a car without dropping from the network. But its speeds were slower than some of the other networks; I downloaded a movie in about 15 seconds. (This is still mind-blowingly fast.) Rollouts for past networks weren't always pretty, resulting in calls dropped, spotty coverage and drained batteries. As Jon Stewart put it in 2011 on \"The Daily Show,\" \"Those of us in the 'iPhone community' have sacrificed one thing for the ability to carry around every photograph we've ever taken, or song we've ever listened to, or home video, or compass. We have sacrificed the ability to make phone calls. For years, for years.\"Now the past could repeat itself. Upgrading tens of thousands of cell sites in the US to 5G will take six to eight years to catch up to 4G's footprint, according to Dan Hays, executive advisor at consulting firm PwC.\"It's an enormous program involving tens of thousands of people all over the country, and not everyone has the skill set to climb the towers to swap antennas,\" he said.5G, which uses similar equipment to 4G, operates on two main types of cell sites: large macro-cell sites that can be installed on towers or rooftops (or hidden in fake cacti and trees), where they are typically housed in enclosures like cabinets or a large closet; and small cells the size of a pizza box, which hang on a light pole, wall or ceiling inside of a building. The latter is a method already in use by 4G networks, but on 5G, it'll move some functions to the cloud, Hays explained.      Eventually, many 5G cell sites will need to be closer together in areas previously covered by a single 4G cell. \"Not all 4G cell sites are easily upgradable,\" Hays said. \"Some could be upgradable with as little as a software update while others may need to be replaced completely.\"A Verizon 5G small cell in Indianapolis.You have 5G. Now what?Even in the areas where 5G is already up and running, getting onto the network can be tricky. To start, you'll need one of the few, pricey, 5G-compatible phones, such as the $1,300 Samsung Galaxy S10 5G or $999 LG V50 5G. (Some testers from the Wall Street Journal and PCMag reportedly overheated when the devices reached a certain temperature. I didn't have similar issues).When more devices start to offer 5G \u2014 and consumers organically upgrade to these new models \u2014 we'll likely see a surge in adoption; that is, if the networks are up and running in more places by then. By 2024, Ericsson Mobility projects more than half of mobile subscriptions will run on 5G in the US. (Apple is expected to launch a 5G iPhone in the fall of 2020). For now, one of the biggest challenges in testing 5G coverage is finding it. I was given a map from Sprint highlighting spots in downtown Chicago where I could pick up 5G. I seamlessly navigated neighborhoods without dropping off the network, envisioning what life will be like when I can download an entire TV season in the few seconds before my coffee order is ready. But without a map on hand in Dallas, I was left guessing which areas would give me 5G Sprint coverage (I was usually wrong). In Chicago on Verizon, 5G worked well on main avenues but not on the side streets \u2014 the equipment hadn't yet made it over to those blocks. On T-Mobile in New York City, I several times found myself automatically connected to 5G while wandering around different neighborhoods. But other times, I could see the carrier's cell sites on buildings nearby and still struggled to get onto the network. Different carriers, different approachesThe four major mobile carriers' approaches to 5G vary based on the spectrum each company already owns. This is why Verizon can say its network is all about speed, Sprint promises continuity, T-Mobile wants to be nationwide first in 2020 and AT&T is doubling down on connecting businesses. Wireless companies have traditionally used low-band spectrums for cell phone service because they travel farther and penetrate walls better than higher frequencies. But higher frequencies offer much faster speeds. The frequencies AT&T and Verizon, known as millimeter wave or \"mmWave\", are using are significantly higher than Wi-Fi. It is the fastest and most responsive form of 5G but doesn't travel far. Sprint's mid-band spectrum casts a much wider net of coverage, allowing 5G users the ability to access it both inside and outdoors. However, my tests on Sprint's network often showed half the speeds of what I often saw on the high-band spectrum. (Sprint has committed to covering 11 million people with 5G by the end of the year.)\nMeanwhile, T-Mobile is focused on deploying low-band spectrum, but in New York City, its network runs on high-band spectrum \u2014 a move that could allow the company to build out its existing infrastructure in the area to get its foot into the 5G race. If it merges with Sprint \u2014 a deal that was recently approved by the Justice Department \u2014 it'll be that much closer to reaching its coverage goal.Beyond phonesNarrowly focused on businesses, AT&T's 5G network is only open to companies and developers, and not available to the general public (though it will be soon). But it's already being used by Rush University Medical Center in Chicago to deliver near real-time remote healthcare monitoring and the ability to transmit large imaging files quickly. It aims to eventually support artificial intelligence to help patient care and augmented reality to train medical students.Meanwhile, AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys, is the first stadium with 5G in the country, where beige high-frequency 5G antennas blend into the industrial, modern aesthetic of the football-shaped venue. The world's most valuable sports franchise plans to give workers, such as parking lot attendants and food service staffers, 5G devices to make everything from in-seat hot dog deliveries to virtual reality fan activations even faster. In July, I performed a series of speed tests inside the stadium that brought in results close to what I experienced outside at the Dallas park, over 1 Gbps per second.     \"We need to understand what 5G is and how it will enhance our fan experience,\" said Matt Messick, chief information officer of the Dallas Cowboys. \"We're one of the first to start asking questions. It's one thing to start talking about it then to have it and start testing it.\"Messick didn't elaborate on what exactly to expect, but stadium-goers are competing with a limited pool of bandwidth; the ability to make calls, check the internet for stats and post videos to social media without lag times is as good of an incentive as any to offer fans in the stands.Mo Katibeh, CMO of AT&T Business, envisions future cities not needing stop lights as self-driving cars automatically communicate with other connected vehicles nearby. Experts project this could become a reality as soon as 2026. \"Everything will be interconnected and 'talk' to each other,\" Katibeh said.A 'dose of reality'5G is expected to have a major impact on the economy, but exactly how that will look is mostly unknown.\"Right now, job creation is all about the deployment of the network, such as from the tower climbers and equipment technicians,\" said Hays, adding it could create a whole new economy just like the internet did. 5G could create up to 3 million new jobs across various industries in the US, from smart city development to robotics and food services, according to Accenture. But Hays called most projections around 5G \"overly optimistic,\" considering for now it's only a faster version of 4G. \"There is a dose of reality that needs to come when you talk about 5G,\" he said. Some of America's 5G ambitions will confront the realities of red tape, costs and other practicalities. For example, some experts say millions of delivery drones could one day be supported by 5G coverage, but the networks today aren't built to work 1,000 feet in the air. Augmented reality could come to car windshields, serving up turn-by-turn directions or even pop-ups of job listings as you drive by businesses. But because US states require glass replacement each time a rock cracks a window, it'll be harder for insurance companies to agree to pay for new windshields.\"Technology development is certainly becoming more feasible, but the question of who will pay also remains,\" Hays said.In Samantha Kelly's test of 5G networks, it took longer to download a movie on T-Mobile's network in New York than it did on other carriers. But even so, 38 seconds to download a nearly 2-hour film is mind-blowingly fast.Consumers aren't looking to pony up for the benefits of 5G either. According to a recent PwC study, about two thirds of respondents said they weren't willing to pay more for 5G than what they're already spending on 4G. (More than half said they already pay too much for internet access). Verizon originally announced it would charge an extra $10 a month for 5G coverage, but has since delayed the additional charge for an undetermined amount of time.Edward Oughton, senior research associate at the University of Oxford who closely studies 5G development, likened the technology to the Concorde, the high-speed turbojet-powered supersonic passenger airliner that flew at twice the speed of sound.\"[It] did not revolutionize global travel; the jumbo jet did,\" Oughton said. \"The technology is very fast but only a few wealthy users will be able to afford it at least initially \u2014 most of whom will be in urban and suburban areas.\" He argued getting the cost per bit of data transfer down is key. \"This is where the biggest productivity benefits will lie; not in faster access in cities,\" he said. All four major US mobile carriers declined to share how many people are currently using their 5G networks, but said they're continually adding new customers. \"Early users might be disappointed with 5G in the beginning as carriers work out kinks,\" PwC's Hays said. \"Consumers should lower their expectations in the months and years ahead.\"     I took his guidance ahead of my final 5G test with T-Mobile in New York City. The carrier's 5G network wasn't the fastest \u2014 it took me longer to download \"Spiderman: Into the Spider-verse\" on T-Mobile than any other network (about 38 seconds) \u2014 but my reaction reminded me how quickly we judge new technologies. When I reached for my 4G phone hours later and a mere app took nearly five times as long to download, I had a newfound appreciation for 5G, even with its limitations. It'll inevitably produce headaches, with spotty service requiring expensive devices to access it \u2014 but eventually, we will look back on this time trying to remember what life was like without it.",

        "content": "For decades, Hahnemann University Hospital served as the main safety-net hospital for downtown Philadelphia's neediest residents. But last week, it released its last patient. Within a month, the hospital's 2,572 staff will all have been laid off, and the doors will close, leaving a gaping hole in the city's ability to serve its poor \u2014 not to mention any victims of trauma, like shootings or car accidents.\"It's not safe. We're right here in the middle of everything. Jefferson [University Hospital] isn't that far, but for a life-threatening situation, minutes matter,\" said Maria Gutierrez, a Hahnemann oncology nurse who on Wednesday received a call from a manager saying all her shifts had been canceled. \"That's why he wants the land.\"The \"he\" Gutierrez was talking about is Joel Freedman, the California-based owner of the private equity-backed company that bought Hahnemann and its sister hospital St. Christopher's for $170 million in early 2018. About a month ago, the entity that owns the two hospitals filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, saying that although St. Christopher's was profitable, Hahnemann's financial situation was unsalvageable.If you have a success like Hahnemann \u2014 that will blow up. Everybody will know that you can make money on the real estate of a hospital.\"Eileen Appelbaum, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy ResearchNot included in the filing: The entity that owns the entire city block's worth of land underneath the hospital, as well as a few associated medical office buildings and parking garages, which Freedman had split off from the operating businesses when he and his co-investors acquired them. The same central location that made Hahnemann valuable as a health care provider \u2014 spitting distance from City Hall and the convention center \u2014 also makes the site incredibly desirable for a high-end hotel or condominiums.That's fueled accusations from the city, the state, the unions representing the hospital workers and even Vermont senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders that Freedman allowed the hospital to slip into bankruptcy, and now wants to free up the land for a potentially lucrative sale.Hahnemann University Hospital served as the main safety-net hospital for downtown Philadelphia's neediest residents. But last week, it released its last patient. Within a month, 2,572 staff will all have been laid off.Read More\"There's no way he doesn't make money off the land,\" said Patrick Clancy, president and CEO of Philadelphia Works, the city's workforce development agency, which is now charged with helping thousands of newly unemployed workers. \"He will have left our city and gone back to wherever he calls home with money in his hands and 2,400 people scrambling around.\"Freedman declined to comment for this story, noting via email \"I will have a lot to say about the Hahnemann situation in a few weeks.\" In a statement released July 15, he said that the state of Pennsylvania had declined to provide needed financial assistance \u2014 which the state disputes \u2014 and that he remained open to any solution that would keep the hospital operating. Freedman has not commented publicly on what may lie ahead for the site.Still, walking away from ailing businesses while profiting from their real estate is right out of the private equity playbook.It's happened again and again in the retail and grocery sectors, which are filled with low-margin businesses that sit on land that could be more valuable if repositioned. From Toys 'R Us to Payless Shoesource, thousands of people have lost jobs when their employers are liquidated, after having been loaded down with unsustainable debt.\"The firms know that even if everything else gets wrong, there's always this real estate to sell,\" says Jim Baker, who runs the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a nonprofit that advocates for people negatively impacted by private equity ownership. \"That becomes part of the deal from the outset.\"When it comes to a hospital, however, the stakes for the community are even higher. If the Hahnemann bankruptcy goes through as planned, advocates worry other private equity firms may try it with struggling hospitals in gentrifying neighborhoods all over the US.\"If you have a success like Hahnemann \u2014 that will blow up,\" says Eileen Appelbaum, a private equity expert who is co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research. \"Everybody will know that you can make money on the real estate of a hospital.\" Senator Bernie Sanders held a rally at Hahnemann Hospital in early July, promising to introduce legislation that would create a $20 billion fund to help local governments purchase hospitals in financial distress.Private equity at the bedsideThe drama at Hahnemann is playing out against the backdrop of a health care industry that private investors are rapidly transforming.According to the management consulting firm Bain & Company, the global value of disclosed private equity buyouts of health care assets ranging from nursing home chains to medical device manufacturers rose to $63.1 billion in 2018, the highest level since 2006. Health care overall has higher margins than any other industry sector, Bain reports, and is seen as relatively durable in the event of an economic downturn, which is why health care buyouts as a share of all private equity deal volume has been rising as well.It's not clear yet what that means for patients. A recent article in the Journal of the American Medical Association expressed concern that private investors tend to demand high returns in a short time frame, which can pressure physicians to push more expensive treatments over less profitable ones, and pressure hospitals to rely on medical staff who have less training.More broadly, wrote authors Suhas Gondi and Zirui Song of Harvard Medical School, private equity firms don't have the same incentives as academic and nonprofit hospitals to use revenue streams from private insurance to subsidize indigent care and medical research. Their charge is primarily to increase profits for investors, usually by consolidating assets in a given geographic area or specialty, before selling them off.\"In the last couple years there's been a profound acceleration in private equity deals in healthcare,\" said Joseph Bruch, a PhD student at Harvard studying how that trend affects patient care, on which there is little definitive research so far. \"We just don't know, and it's happening very fast.\"     From the start, Hahnemann Hospital seemed like an odd target for a private equity investor. Its former owner, Tenet Healthcare, had lost $15 million on Hahnemann and St. Christopher's in fiscal year 2017. Philadelphia is a very competitive market, with several large academic health systems all offering state-of-the-art facilities and vying for patients with private insurance plans.Hahnemann, which served mostly patients insured through Medicaid and struggled to stay afloat on those low reimbursement rates, would have needed massive investment in equipment and IT systems in order to have a shot at attracting a more lucrative clientele.  And health care generally has been moving away from large inpatient facilities towards smaller community-based clinics that can provide most services at a lower cost.Freedman said he would try to turn it around. \"We are thrilled and proud to be the new owners of these venerable Philadelphia hospitals and the outstanding clinical and academic programs for which they are recognized,\" he said in a press release, when the sale went through in 2018.His company, American Academic Health System, is a subsidiary of El Segundo-based Paladin Healthcare, of which Freedman is the sole board member. The acquisition was financed with a $51 million loan from the investment firm Harrison Street Real Estate, and with a revolving line of credit from MidCap Financial, an affiliate of Apollo Global Management, one of the largest private equity firms in the country.Joel Freedman (left) poses for a photo with the president of Howard University, Wayne A.I. Frederick in January 2018. Freedman's company, American Academic Health System, previously managed Howard University Hospital, but the university has said it will not renew the contract, which ended in March.On its website, American Academic touts its management of Howard University Hospital in Washington DC since 2014, saying it reduced costs and increased revenues. That contract ended in March, however, and Howard said it decided not to renew with American Academic. The other hospital system that an affiliate of American Academic managed \u2014 Avanti Hospitals, a portfolio of facilities in California that Freedman co-owned until January \u2014 agreed in December 2018 to pay $8.1 million to the federal Department of Justice to settle allegations that it submitted false claims to Medicare and Medicaid.  Ultimately, American Academic did not invest much in Hahnemann through its subsidiary, Pennsylvania Academic Health System. In bankruptcy filings, the company's restructuring offer said that Hahnemann was losing more money than the previous owner had disclosed, that its technology systems were a mess, and that it carries significant pension obligations, along with more than $100 million in debt to Drexel University College of Medicine \u2014 which used Hahnemann as its primary teaching facility \u2014 and a host of vendors. St. Christopher's was also paying monthly rent of $1.3 million to properties co-owned by Freedman and Harrison Street. On May 8, MidCap filed a notice of default, after which Pennsylvania Academic Health System tried to sell the hospitals. When that failed, it moved to take them through bankruptcy.The city and the state tried to keep the hospital open. A spokesman for Governor Tom Wolf told CNN Business that the state deferred taxes and offered to put Hahnemann on a payment plan, which hospital management never agreed to. Jim Engler, chief of staff to Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney, said that public officials had started meeting with hospital management in April to figure out a funding arrangement that would keep the hospital open, but that they were coy.\"During all that time, when we discussed the future of the hospital, we made requests for documentation to see what the real financial condition of the hospital was,\" Engler said. \"And they never provided any of that documentation.\"In a joint statement released in early July, Wolf and Kenney said Hahnemann's owners \"want a bankruptcy proceeding to protect the profits they extracted from the hospital and community,\" and welcomed any suggestions for \"how we can help mitigate the damage done by Joel Freedman and his firm.\"Allen Wilen, the chief restructuring officer for the hospital, said in a statement that the talks had been fruitless. \"While certain aspects of these discussions were initially promising, there were numerous conditions put forth that were unworkable,\" he said. Freedman blamed the state for reducing the supplemental payments the hospital had received for its Medicaid population, and according to the bankruptcy documents, a potential sale to Drexel fell through.In a last-ditch effort, the city even ordered the hospital to stay open under a 1969 regulation that requires the city's health commissioner to sign off on the closure of an emergency room. But the hospital still stopped admissions on July 17. And there's little else the officials can do: Hahnemann is private property, and the zoning allows for many different uses, so the city doesn't have much leverage.Doctors and nurses have been among those demonstrating against the closure of Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia in protests over the last couple months.Who gets paid? At this point, it's not clear that Freedman and his co-investors will be able to walk away with the full value of the real estate.In bankruptcies like these, if creditors can prove that the debtor never really planned to try to turn around the business and simply stripped its assets, a judge may rule that they have a claim to the proceeds. In this case, that would mean the former owner Tenet, Drexel University, and other vendors may get some of their money back. The real winner could be MidCap Financial, whose nearly $60 million in loans are secured by the mortgage on Hahnemann's main hospital building and the land underneath it, as well as the right to collect Hahnemann's unpaid bills. In the meantime, it's charging interest rates and fees that could generate millions of dollars.Regardless of who gets paid, it's unlikely that Hahnemann will ever re-open as a full-service hospital, said Joseph Fetterman, a Philadelphia-based executive vice president at the commercial real estate brokerage Colliers International. The land could be more valuable as a hotel or condos, the healthcare market in Philadelphia is already oversaturated, and there's no path to profitability for a safety-net facility that needs massive capital investment.These hospitals close under their own weight... This will not be the last. And the real question is, how do the needs of the community get balanced with the right planning solution for the city?\"Joseph Fetterman, executive vice president, Colliers International\"These hospitals close under their own weight,\" Fetterman said. \"The value proposition of these older facilities is by natural occurrence a diminishing prospect. This will not be the last. And the real question is, how do the needs of the community get balanced with the right planning solution for the city?\"That question is actively being debated on the national stage. Sanders held a rally at the hospital in early July, using it as a backdrop to stump for his Medicare for All plan, and promising to introduce legislation that would create a $20 billion fund to help local governments purchase hospitals in financial distress. Beyond helping struggling hospitals, Democrats are moving to clip the wings of private equity. Earlier this month, a group of lawmakers led by Massachusetts senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren introduced a bill that would constrain many of the funds' activities, most notably by making the private equity firm itself liable for any debts incurred by its acquisitions.That legislation is likely going nowhere in the Republican-controlled Senate, but stands a chance of passing if the political winds change after the 2020 election.If the Hahnemann bankruptcy goes through as planned, advocates worry other private equity firms may try a similar strategy with struggling hospitals throughout the US. A system stressed The impact of Hahnemann's closure is already starting to be felt. In the last three weeks, the emergency room at nearby Thomas Jefferson University Hospital has been seeing up to 290 patients per day, up from an average of 175. Despite added staff and building out new space, that's boosted the time from when a patient walks in the door to when they meet a provider from 13 minutes to 18 minutes. Its maternity ward has gone from a projected annual delivery rate of 1,800 births to about 2,800. \"It's been stressful,\" says Jefferson's president, Bruce Meyer. Complicating the issue: The vast majority of the new patients are insured through Medicaid. The state and federal government had funneled millions of dollars a year to Hahnemann to supplement low reimbursement rates. \"In candor, we would need to see some of that come to Jeff to sustain the economics of this patient population,\" Meyer said.About 573 medical residents who started at Hahnemann on July 1 \u2014 the day after the bankruptcy petition was filed \u2014 now have to find new places to call home for the next year. The approximately 800 nurses who were employed at the hospital have a good shot at new jobs in Philadelphia's strong health care market, said Clancy of Philadelphia Works. But with so many looking at once, many might have to travel much further or go back to school to upgrade their certifications. And at the moment, no severance money has been offered to ease the transition. There are other kinds of disruptions from the wind-down, which has been more abrupt and chaotic than anyone anticipated.We lose a paycheck. We lose our maternity leave. We lose our health insurance. But we lose a family, too.\"\nEmma Vrancik, Hahnemann oncology nurseHahnemann oncology nurse Emma Vrancik, 26, had been scheduled to deliver her second child in August. But when she was told that her health insurance would be ending in July, having endured serious complications during her first pregnancy, she decided she couldn't take the risk of untold medical bills if something went wrong again. So she asked her doctor to induce the birth early. Her daughter, Dylan, has lost a pound since birth because of difficulty eating, and remains in the sixth percentile for weight.\"I forced my body to do something it's not supposed to do,\" said Vrancik, who brought the newborn to a protest outside the hospital Wednesday, and teared up talking about the difficult choice.Still, she thinks mostly about her patients. Vrancik didn't know what to tell them when they asked her what was next for their care.\"Of course, we're all wondering, where are we gonna go,\" Vrancik said. \"But the bigger question for us is, where are they gonna go? No one else wants the people that we treat. But we want them.\"\"Our patients keep coming back. We spend birthdays with them. We get them Christmas presents. We're there when they get their diagnosis, and until whatever end they have, and they're family,\" Vrancik continued. \"We lose a paycheck. We lose our maternity leave. We lose our health insurance. But we lose a family, too.\"",

His small home in Limuru village doesn't have running water and its walls are made from corrugated metal. Yet outside, where chickens roam the yard, the father-of-two, who repairs shoes for a living, has a large Chinese-built satellite dish that connects his old television set to hundreds of channels \u2014 many of which are being beamed from Beijing. \"It's advantageous to have many TV channels,\" said Nganga, who was limited to a few local Kenyan stations before the Chinese dish. \"Because you can know how the world is changing every day.\" The StarTimes in AfricaStarTimes has 10 million subscribers in 30 African countries.It's the primary contractor carrying out Chinese President Xi Jinping's 10,000 Villages Project, a lofty plan to take digital television to impoverished parts of Africa. Nganga's connection to the wider world is directly thanks to Xi Jinping, the president of China.In 2015, Xi announced the 10,000 Villages Project, a lofty plan to take digital television to impoverished parts of Africa, such as the village where Nganga lives. Previously, television access in many parts of the continent was a privilege of the elite, and those who were connected relied on old-fashioned, snowy analog reception. Read MoreXi's dream was to upgrade huge swathes of Africa to modern, digital satellite TV networks, that could broadcast a constellation of channels over long distances \u2014 so long, in fact, that a TV channel from Beijing could be beamed to African homes. This was more than just a philanthropic gesture. It was a stroke of soft-power genius that would raise China's profile among Africans, while giving Beijing a tighter grip on the continent's communications infrastructure and control over how it is portrayed there in the media. And it would boost the fortunes and power of one important Chinese company that otherwise keeps a low profile.StarTimes has been the Chinese government's primary contractor to carry out the 10,000 Villages Project, paving the way for the Beijing-based firm \u2014 not any of its American or European media competitors \u2014 to dominate the African market of 1.2 billion people.  A spokesperson for StarTimes said it was \"important\" for Beijing to work with \"an experienced and cost-conscious enterprise for the assignment.\" Today, the company beams Chinese TV shows into the homes of 10 million subscribers in 30 African countries, pushes China's state-owned propaganda news network into households over Western news networks, and controls television networks to such an extent in Zambia and Kenya there have been fears the company could black out TVs in those countries, if it wanted to. While channels like the BBC reach more people and South African distributor MultiChoice has more subscribers, StarTimes' breadth of reach has some critics worrying: Does the company, with its close ties to Beijing, now have too much power over African television networks?In many ways, StarTimes' situation runs parallel to better-known communications giant Huawei, which is battling global criticism for its control over 5G internet networks and ties to Beijing. But unlike Huawei, StarTimes has become one of Beijing's most powerful soft power tools in Africa \u2014 without much of the world even knowing its name.  Here's how it got that way.The African opportunity  In 2000, the Economist ran a cover story about Africa titled \"The Hopeless Continent.\" The headline aptly captured the pity through which much of the Western world viewed the African continent at the time: $1 trillion in development aid hadn't prevented famine from taking one million lives in Ethiopia in the 1980s, stemmed the scourge of AIDS, or stopped a brutal genocide from slaughtering roughly the same number in Rwanda in the 1990s. Aid dollars served to ease Western guilt over what then British Prime Minister Tony Blair called a \"scar on the conscience of the world,\" but aside from drilling for oil and establishing military bases, little energy went into doing real business in Africa. Meanwhile, China took an entirely different approach.A StarTimes transmission site in Limuru, Kenya. Satellite dishes receive content from China, uplink it from Kenya, and beam it out across the country.In the same year as that Economist cover, Chinese President Jiang Zemin invited heads of state across Africa to attend the inaugural Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in Beijing, to discuss how the two regions could better work together. By the mid-2000s, the Chinese government, under its \"Going Out\" strategy, was encouraging entrepreneurs to head abroad and forge stronger ties with African nations.Chinese entrepreneurs looking to make early inroads in nascent markets started moving to Africa. George Zhu, for example, went to Nigeria and launched Transsion, which sells cheap multi-SIM handsets and now has the biggest smartphone share on the continent. Ren Zhengfei took Huawei into Kenya, a country that today remains unfazed by the West's concerns about the company's ties to Beijing. And not long after that, TV enthusiast Pang Xinxing decided to pivot his telecommunications company StarTimes away from China, where the TV market was quickly becoming saturated, and into Africa.Pang reported seeing a largely underdeveloped market where many families either did not have a TV or were sharing one with several households. \"Even if there is a TV, they can only watch two or three channels, digital TV is beyond their imagination,\" he said back in 2002. Furthermore, there was normally only one strong company in each country and users were being charged about $70 a month for a subscription \u2014 a huge fee on a continent where GDP per capita was around $700 a year at the time.Pang saw an opportunity for a low-cost TV provider. Today, StarTimes has some of the world's most affordable digital TV packages, which can cost as little as $4 a month. His arrival was also perfect timing in another way. A 2006 United Nations treaty had tasked African countries with making the switch from snowy, unreliable analog signals to digital by 2015. It was a deadline that nearly all African governments missed but the pressure was on to invest \u2014 and to find a company that could help them do it.That gave StarTimes another revenue stream \u2014 building and operating the digital TV infrastructure of nations.A StarTimes transmission site in Limuru, Kenya.In 2007, Pang landed the company's first digital TV license in Rwanda. The next year, StarTimes launched the Rwanda Digital TV Platform, offering Rwandans more than 30 channels for $3 to $5 a month, including four Chinese channels from the main state-owned broadcaster in mainland China.  When contracts came up to turn off governments' analog networks and take them digital, at first \"StarTimes was the only company competing,\" said Dani Madrid-Morales, an assistant communications professor at the University of Houston, who researched the company while studying as a PhD student at City University of Hong Kong. \"Then [Pang] was able to provide evidence that StarTimes had experience in African countries and offer very low prices.\" Other competitors started to join the market, said Madrid-Morales. But StarTimes almost always won.  Control of a continent's airwaves?Nearly two decades later, the China-Africa summit President Jiang had hosted in 2000 has become one of the most important diplomatic events in many African nations' calendars. In 2018, virtually every African head of state descended on Beijing for the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation to secure a slice of the $60 billion in development loans and business deals on offer.  While in the capital, heads of state and top ministers from Sierra Leone, Lesotho, Malawi, Zambia, Central African Republic, Malawi, Ghana and Uganda all had an important appointment.They visited Pang at the StarTimes' huge mothership on the outskirts of the capital. \"I don't think any head of the BBC has had one-on-one meetings with so many African heads of state,\" Madrid-Morales said.I don't think any head of the BBC has had one-on-one meetings with so many African heads of state.\"Dani Madrid-Morales, an assistant communications professor at the University of HoustonBefriending governments has been crucial to the StarTimes' business, as it bids to win state contracts to help countries make the leap from analog to digital TV. Angela Lewis, a PhD candidate in the international communications department of Nottingham University in Ningbo, China, who has been researching the company for years, said the company has had full backing Beijing in doing this. StarTimes is the only private Chinese company with authorization from the Ministry of Commerce to operate in foreign countries' radio and TV industries. Furthermore, China's state-owned EXIM bank has provided the company with hundreds of millions of dollars in loans to enter the African market. StarTimes claims to be a private enterprise pursuing business goals while maintaining \"cordial relations with its parent state.\"The idea that a company with such close ties to Beijing has control over many African nations' TV networks has sparked headlines such as \"StarTimes plots to take over Africa public broadcasters\" \u2014 echoing concerns that internet security experts have expressed over 5G giant Huawei and how its ties to the Chinese state could compromise other nations' communications infrastructure.A receptionist sits at her desk in the lobby of the StarTimes headquarters in Nairobi.In Zambia, for example, StarTimes entered into a joint venture called TopStar with state broadcaster ZNBC to help the country make the switch to digital TV. The deal gave the Chinese player a 60% share in the state broadcaster for 25 years. That split in the Chinese partner's favor has caused critics to fear that StarTimes has effectively taken control of the country's television network.Josephat Nchungo, an international trade analyst at the University of Zambia, said: \"The primary objective of this partnership is providing the infrastructure for digital TV. The secondary objective is also to exchange culture and knowledge between the two countries. StarTimes has been so controversial because people interpreted it as a sale of the state broadcast to the Chinese and hence the loss of sovereignty.\"StarTimes has been so controversial because people interpreted it as a sale of the state broadcast to the Chinese and hence the loss of sovereignty.\"Josephat Nchungo, international trade analyst at the University of ZambiaSimilar concerns have been raised about deals in Ghana, by the Independent Broadcasters' Association, and Kenya, where StarTimes has also partnered with state broadcasters to operate the new digital network.\"If the StarTimes pulled out of some countries,\" said Madrid-Morales, \"the country's TV stations would stop working. Essentially, StarTimes has the power to black out some countries' TV networks, if it wants.\" That's a claim that StarTimes pushes back on, saying that the company \"does not control any country's TV network and does not have the capacity to spark media black outs.\" That matters because satellite television is the preferred and more affordable option for many Africans.While viewers in the West increasingly consume content through online streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu, the prevalence of pay-as-you-go data contracts in Africa makes watching shows on these type of services expensive.  StarTimes subscriber Purity Njambi watches television with her children, from left, James Ngugi, Margaret Wahu and Agnes Wambui at their home in the Ndumbuini village.George Mbuthia, research analyst for East and West Africa, at IDC, said: \"Although video streaming services are on the rise in Africa, for the majority of the population, mobile video streaming remains out of reach. This is due to poor connectivity and high cost associated with live streaming. Few users use mobile phones for streaming while majority prefer pay-TV.\"There are also economic concerns in the deals that StarTimes has made.To pay for the $271 million contract, for example, Zambia took out loans from China's Export-Import Bank. \"In order for partnerships to happen, the African country must usually take money from Exim bank,\" said Lewis. That raises fears that countries will be saddled with debt to China.It's just one example of how Beijing benefits when StarTimes prospers.Haggai Kanenga, from the department of development studies at the University of Zambia, said: \"The loan shows the money for this project is coming from the Chinese government itself, so these two \u2014 the StarTimes and the Chinese government \u2014 cannot be separated. In Zambia, they are widely viewed as one.\"A hard play for soft power  While StarTimes chased big government contracts to operate digital TV infrastructure, it also wooed consumers with cheap TV packages they could buy on digital networks, which often severely undercut local competitors.From the beginning, the Chinese startup was regularly offering more channels than MultiChoice, the South African market leader in Anglophone Africa, and Canal+ in French-speaking countries \u2014 and for half the price. Consumers could get StarTimes cable and satellite TV packages for as little as $4 per month.The loan shows the money for this project is coming from the Chinese government itself, so these two \u2014 the StarTimes and the Chinese government \u2014 cannot be separated. In Zambia, they are widely viewed as one.\"Haggai Kanenga, researcher at the University of ZambiaCompetitors often complained they were facing unfair competition because StarTimes was so cheap, Madrid-Morales said. But there was little they could do. The content offering by StarTimes included the sort of Filipino and Turkish soap operas that audiences in places like Kenya had been watching for years. But it added Chinese dramas and Kung Fu films to the mix \u2014 the latter proved so popular that StarTimes launched the StarTimes Kung Fu TV channel dedicated to them.  While not overtly political, the Chinese dramas were carefully curated to portray China as a modern, urban place, said Madrid-Morales \u2014 despite the fact that about half of China's population still lives in the countryside. The idea, he says, was to portray China as a wealthy, modernizing country.That aspirational narrative worked. One Chinese drama \"A Beautiful Daughter-in-law Era\" \u2014 about the intermarriage of a countryside migrant woman to an urban man \u2014 proved wildly popular in Africa in the early days after being translated into Swahili, Madrid-Morales said. An orange StarTimes satellite sits atop a home in the Ndumbuini village.In 2011, the company established a huge translation campus on the outskirts of Beijing, where it hired mostly foreign staff to voice Chinese dramas into English and African languages including Swahili and Yoruba. The StarTimes Dubbing Contest scoured African countries seeking out voice actors to be whisked to China to narrate new content. There was also another key component to StarTimes' programming: pro-Chinese news.The cheapest TV packages only gave viewers access to Al Jazeera and China Global Television Network (CGTN) \u2014 a state-owned news broadcaster that is part of Xi's soft power mission to \"tell the China story well.\" That has often translated into reporting the news with a pro-China slant, to such an extent that in the United States, CGTN recently had to register as a foreign agent under anti-propaganda laws. One analysis of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Africa, for example, found that 17% of stories by CGTN (then operating under a different name) mentioned China, emphasized the role its doctors played in the relief efforts. In reality, China had spent far less than the US, United Kingdom and Germany fighting the disease. Western news channels, such as the BBC, whose broadcasts in many African nations are not subject to the kind of government censorship that they are in China, were available only on more expensive packages.  A huge turning pointIn a flashy business district in downtown Nairobi, Japhet Akhulia is celebrating at the StarTimes' new glass headquarters. After another round of price slashing, StarTimes has hit 1.5 million subscribers in Kenya, putting it just behind the established player MultiChoice, says Akhulia, brand marketing director for the company in the East African country. Japhet Akhulia is the director of brand marketing at StarTimes Kenya.StarTimes has been in Kenya since 2012, but its recent growth has been driven, at least in part, by the support of President Xi.In 2018, Beijing gave Akhulia's team 800 million Kenyan shillings (roughly $7.8 million) to roll out the 10,000 Villages project in Kenya. That money would take StarTimes to an additional 16,000 households and 2,400 public institutions, such as schools and hospitals, across the country for free. Half that money was for equipment, and the half was for implementation costs including travel of StarTimes' staff.In most villages where the StarTimes installs TV for free, a mural is painted with the flags of Kenya and China side by side. That StarTimes enjoys a mutually beneficial relationship with Beijing is clear: the company is paid to execute the 10,000 Villages Project, and gains more customers from doing so. Xi gets to put Chinese content into households across Africa.That symbiotic relationship caused onlookers like Lewis to question how private StarTimes really is.\"It's obviously a proxy for the Chinese state,\" she said.Pang has never given an interview to Western media, enabling him to answer such allegations. As the StarTimes' founder's fortunes have amassed, he has kept an assiduously low profile even on matters such as whether or not he is a Communist Party member.When asked about the government's relationship with StarTimes, a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing said via fax: \"The Chinese government is always encouraging quality and reputable Chinese enterprises to develop in Africa.\"\"It's not easy to carry out the 10,000 villages project. Many foreign countries have neither the capability nor willingness to do this. In fact, the project has earned extensive recognition from local governments and people,\" the spokesperson continued. \"Last year, elementary students in remote Zambia watched the World Cup thanks to this project. Zambian president Edgar Lungu said publicly several times that the China-Zambia relations are mutually beneficial, and any distorted publicity can't stop us from advancing our friendship for mutual principles and benefits.\"Localized contentSande Bush is a comedian known as Dr. Ofweneke. But recently he's been wondering if his stage name should be Dr. Love. That's because Bush is the co-presenter of hit dating TV show \"Hello, Mr. Right,\" which pairs Kenyans with potential love matches. \"Actually, men have proposed on air,\" says Bush. \"These guys were literally just falling in love at first sight. It was beautiful.\" \"Hello, Mr. Right\" is important because it was StarTimes' first foray into producing African-made content in Kenya, having already successfully tested the waters in Nigeria. The project shows how the Chinese company is evolving in local markets to maintain its foothold. While conceived and directed by Chinese executives, the format of the show was shaped by its African co-hosts Bush and Vera Sadika. \"It was easy to communicate. We gave them fresh ideas. We're very modern and we know what's trendy,\" Sadika said.Comedian Dr. Ofweneke is the co-host of the popular StarTimes dating show \"Hello, Mr. Right.\"As StarTimes secured its stronghold in Africa, creating localized content was key to growing its position in the market \u2014 and warding off Western competitors, who having seen the success of Chinese companies like StarTimes and Transsion on the continent. Meanwhile Netflix has been painfully slow to the continent. It finally entered Africa in 2016  \u2014  but even then it encountered criticism for demanding too much bandwidth for many slow internet connections in the region, where many people still have pay-as-you-go data contracts. Good internet speeds can be prohibitively expensive. StarTimes' localization has benefited local African creative industries, which have received investment from the Chinese firm.\"Africa is a scientific experiment for the creative industries of China,\" Lewis said, noting that the underdeveloped market in Africa often gives entrepreneurs a blank slate to play with. The more Chinese firms invest and experiment in Africa, the deeper their marketplace dominance is entrenched on the continent \u2014 and the more Beijing's soft power grows. While Spotify and Apple Music target users mostly in developed markets, for example, Boomplay, which is owned by two Chinese companies, has become the largest streaming music service in Africa; it has 46 million users on the continent with a catalog of five million videos and songs, according to the company's figures.The Chinese phone giant that beat Apple to AfricaThat early adoption advantage is what StarTimes has been banking on for decades, as it hoovers up government contracts and customers, from poor to elite, sewing up television markets across the continent. As the African continent continues to migrate to digital TV, StarTimes' subscriber base is predicted to jump to 14.85 million by 2024, according to Digital TV Research \u2014 putting it ahead of MultiChoice.That will only deepen China's influence in a region that the West once saw as \"the Hopeless Continent.\" But should African nations be worried about StarTimes' influence and relationship with Beijing, in the same way the West is about Huawei?Madrid-Morales doesn't think so. The potential negative consequences of having StarTimes dominate Africa's television networks are still just possibilities, he said. Secondly, the costs associated with building these networks are enormous. Many countries couldn't have done it without Beijing.\"In the tradeoff between letting go of some sovereignty and building a state-of-the-art telecommunications network, most African countries have chosen the latter,\" he said.CNN's Serenitie Wang also contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Something extraordinary is happening behind the scenes at Impossible Foods. The company has seen a huge surge in demand. And though you wouldn't know it from stepping into its Bay Area headquarters, it's in a frenzy. The problem: Impossible is running low on fake meat.The company makes a plant-based protein that can be fashioned into burgers. Its audacious goal is to help eliminate the need for animals from the meat supply by 2035. Today, Impossible is a marquee brand in one of the hottest sectors of the food business.Impossible's main office in many ways fits the startup mold: Employees work at desks in an open-concept layout, pausing to play ping pong or meet in conference rooms with cute names like \"Jello\" and \"Ice Cream.\" Read MoreBut the calm order is deceptive. It's not business as usual there.The number of orders for Impossible Burgers just keeps rising, and the company, founded in 2011, is struggling to keep up. We're going to go after the vast majority of people who are still buying meat as our customers.\"Pat Brown, Impossible Foods CEOSome of the office workers have been voluntarily reassigned to Impossible's factory in Oakland, where they work 12-hour shifts in what is essentially a warehouse-sized refrigerator. The temperature is 38 degrees, and the tasks include packing boxes and operating machinery. They've given up weekends, toiling from 3 PM to 3 AM or vice versa. To appease frustrated customers including high-end restaurants, Impossible, which usually sells its product through a network of more than 400 distributors, has started FedExing shipments directly. And it's shifted from making patties to selling only five-pound bricks of the plant-based protein. The bricks, though not ideal for most restaurant customers, are more efficient to make and require less packaging.  It's been a \"company-wide scramble,\" said CEO Pat Brown. But a welcome one. Impossible Burger patty samples are seen at the test kitchen inside the company's headquarters in Redwood City, California.Shortages aside, it's a good time to be Impossible. Interest in plant-based protein has spiked as consumers, looking to eat healthier and reduce their impact on the planet, give meat substitutes a try. Impossible's main competitor, Beyond Meat, has impressed investors so much that its stock has more than doubled since debuting on the stock exchange in May \u2014 a sign that Wall Street thinks the trend has legs. But interest in the product also means that young companies like Beyond and Impossible, which is still privately held, may not be able to dominate the trend for long. Nestl\u00e9, which sells a meatless burger in Europe, plans to introduce a US version this fall. And big meat producers like Tyson and Perdue are putting their own spin on the trend with blended products made with real meat and vegetables. They may launch closer alternatives to Impossible's protein, as well. As the field gets more crowded, Impossible will have to figure out a way to not only keep up with skyrocketing demand, but also to maintain its competitive edge. The question is: how?All hands on deckImpossible Foods enjoyed some early successes after Brown, who is now 64, founded the company in 2011. A biochemist and former pediatrician, he speaks passionately about the company's environmental mission. He points to meat production as the leading cause of a global decline in wildlife over the last 50 years, and gave up what he has described as his \"dream job\" as a tenured professor at Stanford University's School of Medicine to devote himself to developing a better alternative.Pat Brown, Impossible Foods CEO, wants to help eliminate the need for animals in the meat supply chain by 2035.Five years in, Impossible started selling plant-based burgers, which gained notoriety in part because they seemed to bleed like real meat. The company attracted funding from Bill Gates and launched in White Castle restaurants.But in January 2019, Impossible went into overdrive.It was then that the company launched the Impossible 2.0. Earlier versions of the protein had been optimized to cook well on a flat-top stove as a burger patty. The new iteration, however, is more versatile, designed to mimic meat when grilled, saut\u00e9ed, braised or stewed. Of course, the company hoped it would be a success. But the speed at which the product took off was surprising, said David Lee, the company's chief financial officer.  Impossible 2.0 quickly drove up orders. Burger King started testing an Impossible Whopper in 59 restaurants in St. Louis. That test went so well that a month later, in May, the chain shared that it would start selling the Impossible Whopper in its 7,300 US restaurants by the end of the year. A technician weighs a tray of Impossible meatballs inside the test kitchen.For Impossible, that meant that orders were coming in from every direction: Old customers, new customers and a national chain with thousands of locations. To put that hockey-stick like growth in context: At the end of April, Impossible products were in about 7,000 restaurants total. Two months later, they're in nearly 10,000. By the end of the year, if Impossible's product is served in every Burger King as planned, it could be available in at least 17,000 restaurants altogether. I wasn't scared. I was ecstatic. We've been preparing for some time to have a runaway success.\" David Lee, Impossible Foods CFOAt the end of April, Impossible issued a mea culpa to customers, acknowledging a shortage. The company \"sincerely apologizes to all customers, particularly those who have come to depend on the additional foot traffic and revenue that the Impossible Burger has generated,\" it said in a statement at the time.The shortage required an all-hands-on-deck approach. But executives didn't panic. \"I wasn't scared. I was ecstatic,\" Lee said. \"We've been preparing for some time to have a runaway success.\" Flasks of soy leghemoglobin \u2014 or heme \u2014 undergo fermentation inside a shaker at Impossible Foods' research and development lab.Impossible's product \"was designed at the very beginning to scale globally,\" Lee said.The company's secret weapon is heme \u2014 an iron-containing molecule found in plants and animals that, according to Impossible, is responsible for meat's flavor and aroma. Before launching commercially in 2016, the company had spent hundreds of millions of dollars and many years figuring out how to make heme in a way that was easy to scale. By sourcing heme from fermented, genetically-modified yeast, rather than harvested soy plants, Impossible could prepare it in large batches with minimal environmental impact. Equipment is also key. To make sure that the company can grow quickly, Lee explained, Impossible uses machines that are already available on the market. It doesn't have to make or customize them. We are absolutely committed and determined to get ahead of the demand and never be in a position where we can't serve our customers again.\"Pat Brown, Impossible Foods CEOThe process means that Impossible should be able to produce a lot of material, quickly. But with such an unexpected surge in demand, it still has had trouble keeping up.That led Impossible to implement a new planning system, stochastic modeling, that factors in large fluctuations in demand. For Impossible, it could be a better way to plan ahead for large orders from new clients like Burger King. Labor is the other crucial part of the equation. Overall, the company employs about 440 people, including 110 in research and development and 180 in its manufacturing plant. The rest are general business professionals in fields like sales, marketing and finance, working mainly out of the Redwood City headquarters, and some remotely. While about 40 those employees have recently taken up manufacturing shifts to help with production, Impossible is focused on bringing on more factory workers.  Lab coats hang inside the lab.Eventually, the company would like to have three, shorter shifts instead of two 12-hour ones.Brown is confident this approach will help Impossible catch up on orders and prevent future shortages. \"We are absolutely committed and determined to get ahead of the demand and never be in a position where we can't serve our customers again,\" he said.But shortages may not be the biggest threat Impossible faces. Enter Big Food Right now, consumers seeking plant-based proteins may feel like they have two main options: An Impossible Burger or a Beyond Meat burger.There's a Goliath entering into the market.\"  Arash Azadegan, Rutgers Business School associate professorBeyond is in itself a formidable opponent. Unlike Impossible Burgers, Beyond's plant-based product, made from pea protein, is sold in both restaurants and grocery stores. The company had a blockbuster IPO in May, and has since continued to floor investors. It reported an impressive spike in sales in the first quarter.Impossible plans to launch in grocery stores by the end of the year. And though it hasn't announced any plans for an IPO, hype around the sector has helped the company raise another $300 million. The recent round of funding included cash infusions from celebrities like Jay-Z, Katy Perry, Serena Williams, Jaden Smith, Trevor Noah and Zedd. But competition is growing. Food giants, attracted by predictions of massive, sector-wide growth, are entering the market. Heme is added to a bowl of soy-based mixture in the test kitchen.Food industry analysts agree that the plant-based protein sector has huge potential. The meat substitute market will grow to $22.9 billion in 2023, compared to $18.7 billion in 2018, predicts research firm Euromonitor International. In the United States alone, Euromonitor said, those figures will jump from $1.4 billion in 2018 to $2.5 billion five years later.Euromonitor's numbers are modest compared to others. Barclays estimates that the alternative meat sector could reach about $140 billion over the next decade, capturing about 10% of the global meat industry.  Nestl\u00e9 is already taking an aggressive position in Europe by supplying patties to McDonald's for its meatless burgers in Germany. When Nestl\u00e9 launches a meatless burger in the United States in the fall, it could start scooping up big restaurant partners. Nestl\u00e9's scale, volume and extensive distribution channels could make it a game changer, said Arash Azadegan, an associate professor at Rutgers Business School with expertise in supply chain management. The company's large, well-established system can help keep costs down and supply plentiful. \"There's a Goliath entering into the market,\" Azadegan said.But it's not just about Nestl\u00e9. Tyson and Perdue have launched their meat-and-vegetable blended products, and may well come out with others that more closely resemble Impossible and Beyond's burgers. Smaller players, like Dr. Praeger's, are experimenting with their own meat-like, plant-based proteins.Eventually, every meat seller will have some version of Impossible and Beyond's product, predicts William Rosenzweig, faculty director of the sustainable food initiative at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business.\"Being a first mover does not constitute a long-term position,\" he said, pointing to Blue Apron as an example of another hyped startup in the food industry. Although it initially led the meal kit trend, Blue Apron later struggled to succeed among a crowded field of competitors.An Impossible Burger patty is seasoned in the test kitchen.Impossible, similarly, has a recognizable brand. The company \"has done a fantastic job of creating an identity for its product early on,\" Rosenzweig said. By making sure that its products keep the Impossible branding when served in restaurants (the Impossible Whopper, for example, isn't called the \"Vegan Whopper\") Impossible has made sure to get its name out there. But that may not be enough. \"Scale matters in food,\" Rosenzweig said. And branding doesn't tend to impact how people select foods that they think of as ingredients, like burger patties. You might order a grass-fed burger at a restaurant, but you're not likely to request one made by Tyson. As plant-based protein burgers hit the mainstream, people may be perfectly satisfied with whatever they're served, Rosenzweig said. \"If it's in a bun, and it's filled with delicious ketchup and mustard and pickles and onions,\" he said, nuances in taste or appearance may not matter. Ultimately, consumers may go for the cheapest, most accessible option. For now, Impossible Burgers are sold at a price that's slightly more expensive than real meat burgers. The Impossible Whopper costs about a dollar more than the regular Whopper. At White Castle, the Impossible slider costs $1.99. If Nestl\u00e9 and others introduce a cheaper, comparable product, it could crowd Impossible out. Beefier than beef?Impossible argues that taste is what matters most, and that its army of scientists will make the most appealing burger. The company's research and development team is constantly tinkering with Impossible's protein, looking for ways to make it more realistic. Experts spend hours smelling different aroma combinations, teasing out odors like salami, pepperoni and even cheese to help Impossible hone in on the exact scent of cooking meat. Impossible's goal is to win over meat eaters with a product that is \"beefier, more craveable\" than real beef.Other employees are encouraged to participate in elaborate taste tests in a dedicated room, where blue lights are used to mask the real color of the food samples. (Color can influence the way people interpret flavor, the thinking goes.) In addition to the lab, Impossible also has an industrial test kitchen where scientists experiment with different cooking techniques, fashioning the protein into meatballs, lasagnas and sausages. The goal is not to target vegans and vegetarians, per se, but meat eaters.\"We're going to go after the vast majority of people who are still buying meat as our customers,\" Brown said. He believes that one day, consumers will prefer the taste of Impossible protein to meat from animals. The approach also allows Impossible to shrug off concerns that it could lose customers who want a healthier, less-processed product, or for whom a blended meat and veggie product is preferable. Using heme, the company plans to develop a product that will be \"beefier, more craveable\" and \"tastier\" than real beef, Lee said. Time will tell if people prefer plants to meat, or meat to plants \u2014 or something else altogether. \"I don't think anyone else has come close to us in terms of being able to make a plant-based product that really delivers as meat,\" Brown said. \"But I love the fact that a bunch of people are acknowledging the value of it, and jumping in,\" he added. \"The more the merrier.\"",

Japanese automaker Honda was hiring American workers for its first plant on US soil. \"It was a bit of shock that Honda decided to come to Ohio,\" says Vining, now a chief engineer at Honda's Marysville auto plant. Back then, Marysville was a quaint, rural town with about 7,000 people. There was one high school, a few mom-and-pop stores and a single drive-through restaurant. It was a world away from the gritty, industrial US motor heartland of Detroit.

Hide Caption 12 of 12Vining, who was working for a small engine manufacturer, says getting a job at the new Honda plant felt like the opportunity of a lifetime. \"Honda was a household name,\" he says. \"We recognized it for its quality and reasonable price.\"Vining was one of the 53 American and 11 Japanese original hires at Honda's (HMC) first US motorcycle plant, which expanded to include an auto plant in 1982. Since then, Japan has become deeply embedded in the US auto economy.Read MoreToday, Honda, Nissan (NSANF), Toyota (TM) and Subaru (FUJHF) all operate manufacturing plants across the United States, with Toyota and Mazda planning a new $1.6 billion auto assembly plant in Alabama that will employ around 4,000 people when it opens in 2021. Last year, Japanese car makers created 1.6 million jobs in the US, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. While Japanese car makers claim to build one third of all vehicles in the United States, and purchased $61.2 billion in US auto parts in 2018, many of those cars use imported Japanese parts, which were worth $16 billion last year.        President Donald Trump sees that as a problem. In May, he declared imported auto parts and vehicles a national security threat and threatened to slap up to 25% tariffs on them. That has left the future of Japan's auto industry on American soil looking uncertain. As Trump and world leaders descend on Osaka, in Japan, Thursday for the G20, tariffs and the trade war with China will be high on the agenda. But this isn't the first time Japanese motor brands have been threatened by a trade war. In the 1980s, the United States also hit Japanese automakers with tariffs designed to bring motor manufacturing back to America.Those measures only helped Japanese brands like Honda thrive.Made in JapanWhen Honda arrived in the United States, the \"made in Japan\" label was tarnished by bad memories of World War II and associated with poor quality workmanship, due to low levels of economic development in Japan in the post-war years.  \"[Japanese automakers] had to overcome a lot of prejudice and mockery,\" says Wanda James, author of \"Driving from Japan: Japanese cars in America.\" During the 1950s, however, quality Japanese products such as the Minolta and Pentax cameras entered the United States market, shifting American attitudes. Honda's 1963 marketing campaign dubbed 'You meet the nicest people on a Honda' aimed to disconnect motorcycles from the rugged, counterculture biker image embodied by US brands.In 1959, the American Honda Motor Co. was established in Los Angeles and, after partnering with a few local dealerships, began importing small bikes such as the Honda 50 to the United States. By the 1960s, American Honda sales were shooting through the roof, going from $500,000 in 1960 to $77 million in 1965 \u2014 fueled by a 1963 marketing campaign, sloganed \"You meet the nicest people on a Honda,\" which inspired the Beach Boys' hit song \"Little Honda.\" By deliberately attempting to disconnect motorcycles from the counterculture image embodied by acolytes of the Harley-Davidson brand, the campaign created a new market, selling Hondas as a lightweight, lower-cost option to people who had never before thought of buying a motorcycle. Oil crisis ... or a blessing?The next decade gave Honda another big break. In 1973, tensions between the United States and the Arab world sparked an oil embargo that sent gas prices soaring. The embargo was lifted in 1974, but high oil prices remained. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFour Honda facts\n\n\n\n\n1948\n\n\n\nSoichiro Honda and Takeo Fujisawa establish Honda Motor Co., Ltd. In 1949, they introduce their first product, the \"Dream\" D-type motorcycle.\n\n\n\n\n1959\n\n\n\nHonda establishes its first overseas subsidiary in Los Angeles, California.\n\n\n\n\n1974\n\n\n\nHonda engineers create a CVCC engine, making the Honda Civic the first vehicle to meet the strict emissions standards of the US Clean Air Act -- a law established in 1970 against air pollution.\n\n\n\n\n1982\n\n\n\nThe Accord became the first car from a Japanese manufacturer to be produced in the US at Honda's Marysville Auto Plant in Ohio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Honda\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Americans started seeking smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, Japanese car makers had an advantage over gas-guzzling US brands.  \"That's what sold a lot of the US public to the Japanese brands to this day,\" says David Emerling, the director of the Center of Automotive Research (CAR) in Ohio.Sales were also supercharged by the introduction of the 1970 Clean Air Act, which restricted the amount of lead in gasoline. In 1974, Honda engineers created a new type of combustion engine, which made the Honda Civic the first vehicle to meet the strict new limits on auto emissions, as the car could run on both leaded and unleaded petrol. Honda bosses decided to expand the business and, in 1975, Shige Yoshida, then vice president of American Honda, was dispatched to scout out a location for an automobile plant. The goal was to source parts locally and make products suited to local consumers.  Yoshida says Honda Motor chose Marysville owing to the friendly, hardworking locals, presence of a testing track in East Liberty, Ohio, and a favorable investment climate. As the plant prepared to open, Yoshida, now age 87, started visiting auto factories in Detroit to get a feel for how Americans operated. \"I really liked how people-oriented one manager I met seemed,\" says Yoshida. \"He walked through the production aisles greeting and smiling at everyone.\"Shige Yoshida was tasked with exploring the possibility of setting up a Honda production plant on US soil in the 1970s.Later in the 1980s, Yoshida welcomed US automakers to visit the Honda plants in Marysville. The collaboration, he says, was a good thing for the industry. \"Everyone saw Honda as an advantage, not a threat,\" says Emerling. \"Because they knew that job creation in a very rural state in Ohio would have an immense impact on the economy.\" Trade war of the 1980sWhen recession hit the United States in the 1980s, Japan was the world's second largest economy. Many Americans feared they were about to be overtaken.   After President Ronald Reagan took office in 1981, the United States began pressuring Japan to open its market to American companies and reduce the trade imbalance between the countries \u2014 much as  Trump today is trying to reduce the trade deficit with China, now the world's second largest economy.A trade war began between Washington and Tokyo, as the US administration introduced Voluntary Export Restraints (VER), which capped the number of imported vehicles to the United States. In 1981, Japanese automakers were only allowed to export 1.68 million vehicles to America. Before the quotas were introduced they had exported 1.82 million in 1980, according to JAMA. Honda produces its 3 millionth vehicle on January 21, 1993, a special Anniversary Accord model to commemorate 10 years of US auto production in Marysville, Ohio.American consumers, caught up in the battle for global economic dominance, bore the cost by paying more for Japanese cars. A similar effect is being seen today, with retailers reporting that tariffs on Chinese products are driving up prices on consumer goods at home.To avoid the quotas of the 1980s, more Japanese automakers decided to move manufacturing on to American shores and establish alliances with domestic car makers.Nissan set up its first motor manufacturing plant in 1983 in Tennessee and Toyota set up shop in Fremont, California, in partnership with General Motors, in 1986. Faced with import restrictions, Japanese automakers also pivoted to selling more lucrative, luxury vehicles, such as the Honda Acura and Toyota Lexus, which competed with the medium-sized cars that had traditionally been the bread-and-butter of American brands.As Japanese automakers adapted to the political climate, they flourished. Almost one in three passenger cars sold in the United States was made by a Japanese-owned firm in 1991. By 2007, Toyota had overtaken General Motors (GM) to become the world's leading automaker. New automotive realityFast forward 12 years and Japanese manufacturers are once again under the gun. But while Trump is threatening tariffs to boost the US economy, experts say the President's tactics could actually deal a devastating blow to American consumers and workers.Production began at Honda's Marysville plant on September 10, 1979. The CR250R motorcross bike was the first model to be built.\"With history as a guide, a tight quota on Japanese auto produced cars or auto parts will hurt not just American consumers, but also American firms,\" says Thomas J Prusa, an economics professor at Rutgers University. \"That's because many American jobs are tied to the supply chain that comes from Japan.\"It's not just jobs that are at risk. With history as a guide, a tight quota on Japanese auto produced cars or auto parts will hurt not just American consumers, but also American firms. \u2014Thomas Prusa, Rutgers UniversityCurrently, Japanese automakers fund research into manufacturing and advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence in tech hubs such as Silicon Valley. Tariff costs could squeeze budgets for such initiatives, says Manny Manriquez, general director of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association USA.\"The US auto industry can't function and thrive if it's cut off from international trade,\" adds Manriquez. \"Trade restrictions and continued uncertainty will not just weaken the entire automotive industry, they could result in lost opportunities for the US.\"Last year, in a bid to cement his \"America First\" strategy, Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, a trade deal between the United States and 11 other countries. Since then, Tokyo has spearheaded a revised pact with the remaining signatories. And in 2019, Japan's free trade agreement with the European Union \u2014 which benefits automakers \u2014 also took effect. Such deals position Japan well for doing business with partners outside America. Toyota Motor said that Trump's position \"sends a message to Toyota that our investments are not welcomed, and the contributions from each of our employees across America are not valued.\"The company added that it hopes trade negotiations can be resolved quickly.Made in AmericaSince setting up shop in the United States, Honda has crossed many milestones. It produced its 25 millionth US-made car in 2018, and employs more than 31,000 people in the United States to make products that include cars, trucks, vans, SUVs, motorcycles, lawn mowers, and even robots.

        "content": "A plywood fence hides what remains of a small daycare center, coffee shop and auto body place that were demolished last month at 6th and Hobart Street in Koreatown, one of Los Angeles' fastest-developing neighborhoods. It's a few blocks from the sleek Line hotel and just off busy Wilshire Boulevard, a strip dotted with luxury apartment complexes and construction work on a new subway line. The site is slated to become a Hyatt Centric hotel \u2014 and if all goes according to plan, it will also save its investors a tidy sum because of a massive new tax incentive program born from President Donald Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act a year and a half ago. That law made it substantially cheaper to back either real estate projects or operating businesses in one of 8,764 low-income, high-poverty census tracts across the country that have been designated \"Opportunity Zones.\" One in ten Americans now live in one of the zones, which were chosen by state governors out of the thousands of eligible tracts; they span downtowns, rural areas and desperately poor neighborhoods \u2014 as well as upscale urban playgrounds.    The program's backers say it will push capital into places that have historically missed out on it, and they intentionally crafted it to be free of the many rules and restrictions that have guided similar programs in the past. Opportunity Zones are not subject to criteria set by state governments like Low Income Housing Tax Credits, for example, or funneled toward mission-driven developers and lenders like New Markets Tax Credits, which allow investors to lower their income taxes by providing capital in depressed communities. Bryan Shaffer, left, and Leo Y. Lee at the site of a new luxury hotel in Los Angeles' Koreatown. Shaffer is helping Lee, the developer, line up financing for the project. They are seeking Opportunity Fund investment for part of the cost.In doing so, however, they opened up large tracts that were already magnets for investment, potentially sucking any new dollars away from places that could really use it. And even though data is scarce and capital is only starting to flow, anecdotal reporting suggests that Los Angeles is a microcosm of how the program is playing out nationally. Read MoreAlong with Koreatown, tracts designated as Opportunity Zones include parts of Hollywood, Downtown, and the Arts District right next door, which TimeOut has dubbed \"LA's trendiest neighborhood.\" So far, that appears to be where most of the deals are getting done \u2014 rather than places like Census tract 5425.02, better known as Compton, where the median household income is $35,457, barely half of the national median. About 35% of people there live below the poverty line \u2014 almost triple the national poverty rate.\n\nBryan Shaffer is a principal with George Smith Partners, a boutique firm that helps developers finance complex deals. He's working on the Koreatown hotel project, and can name a handful of others in the neighborhood that are also looking for capital from Opportunity Funds, the tax-advantaged investment vehicles that can funnel money into businesses or real estate projects located in Opportunity Zones. \"Accountants and attorneys looked at this and said, 'Wait a minute, this could be huge',\" Shaffer said. \"The question from the community development side is: It's good that we're seeing more development in Koreatown, but is there a point where it spreads? It's not a clear picture.\" That's left people who are interested in community-oriented development \u2014 projects like affordable housing, health care clinics, grocery stores and businesses that employ local residents \u2014 scrambling for the attention of investors who might be willing to accept a normal return, rather than a super-charged one. And the way the Opportunity Zones have been set up, both investors and the people trying to attract them face a deadline. The value of the tax break starts to decline after the end of 2019. Even though it still has value in future years, fund managers seeking to maximize their return are prospecting deals that are shovel-ready, low risk and straightforward. Toys lie on the ground as a preschool is cleaned out before it gets demolished at a construction site in Koreatown.Maurice Jones is president of the Local Initiatives Support Coalition, a national community development nonprofit, which is helping communities leverage Opportunity Zones to further their own goals. The sense of urgency among investors, he said, makes it harder for communities to attract capital for complicated projects in marginal neighborhoods.\"There's a panic going on that is a constructed panic,\" Jones said. \"The more people say 'this can only happen this year,' the more it will only happen in a few places. People need to stay calm.\" A tax break with no strings attachedOpportunity Zones were born as an idea that both liberals and conservatives could love. The tax provision was the brainchild of the Economic Innovation Group, a think tank cofounded by the Napster entrepreneur Sean Parker. It found legislative champions in South Carolina Republican Senator Tim Scott and New Jersey Democratic Senator Cory Booker, who slipped a section into the omnibus tax bill steamrolling its way through Congress in late 2017, attracting little attention amid the debate over deep corporate and individual tax cuts. In some ways, it resembles other geographically-defined tax breaks like the state-based Enterprise Zones of the 1980s and the Empowerment Zones designated by President Bill Clinton in 1993, which haven't proven very successful in the past. But that's where the comparison ends: This incentive is more valuable and less restricted than any of its predecessors. It applies to almost any type of project, requires no bureaucratic approval or monitoring and has no cap. According to its framers, that was by design. If the old programs were too rule-bound to make much of a difference, this one would create a much bigger funnel of money, at least some of which would reach underinvested areas \u2014 even if a bit of it also ends up leaking out to projects that might have happened anyway. The status quo is far worse than what is a massive policy experiment in providing an incentive for investment,\"STEVE GLICKMAN, COFOUNDER OF THE ECONOMIC INNOVATION GROUP\"What would bother me is not having enough aggregate investment to move the needle. You really need tens of billions of dollars to dig out of this hole we've dug,\" said Steve Glickman, a former Obama administration official who co-founded the Economic Innovation Group and now runs a consulting firm that advises Opportunity Funds. \"The status quo is far worse than what is a massive policy experiment in providing an incentive for investment.\" The openness of the tax break has made Opportunity Zones the talk of investor confabs like the Milken and SALT Conferences last month, which had nine sessions on the subject between them. (SALT is put on by SkyBridge Capital, the investment fund of former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, who has started a real estate investment trust focused on Opportunity Zones himself.) Manny Friedman, CEO and co-chief investment officer of EJF Capital described Opportunity Zones as \"the biggest program that anyone has ever seen in their lifetime,\" at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills in April.\"People in this room do not understand how gigantic this is,\" EJF Capital CEO Emanuel Friedman said at the Milken Global Conference in Beverly Hills, barely containing his enthusiasm onstage. \"I'm here to tell you this is the biggest program that anyone has ever seen in their lifetime.\"\"It'll be a trillion dollars of equity just to start with. It's going to transform your lives, it's going to transform the lives of the people on the stage,\" continued Friedman, whose firm is raising a $300 million Opportunity Fund that has already announced projects in South Carolina, Washington DC, and Oakland, California. \"If you live in Silicon Valley, you should be selling your house, because every startup is going to be moving to an Opportunity Zone, because the advantages are so mind boggling across the board.\" And it's not just opportunistic hedge funds. Some of the country's biggest banks, which have already been lending and investing in poor areas for years as part of their obligations under the federal Community Reinvestment Act, are positioning themselves to benefit from the zones as well. PNC closed a $486 million fund last summer, for example, and Goldman Sachs began setting up funds days after the law passed. \"We've been investing in these communities for close to two decadaes, so there isn't really a change in strategy,\" said Margaret Anadu, who heads Goldmans Sachs' Urban Investment Group, on the company's podcast. \"I think how we're thinking about it is as another tool in the tool belt.\" Here's how it works: Someone who reinvests a capital gain worth $100 in an Opportunity Zone in 2019 gets a 15% \"step up in basis,\" which means she has to pay the federal capital gains tax on only $85 of that original income. At a tax rate of 23.8%, that comes to $20 \u2014 and she doesn't have to pay it for another 10 years.  Can average investors take advantage of Opportunity Zone tax breaks?On top of that, if she holds the investment for at least 10 years, she pays no capital gains taxes on the proceeds from Opportunity Zone investment. The Economic Innovation Group calculated that would result in a net after-tax profit of $76, compared to $36 if the original capital gain were invested in a regular stock portfolio, assuming 7% annual rates of return for both. Looked at another way, if a stock market portfolio generated after-tax returns of about 2.8% per year, the Opportunity Zone incentive amounts to an extra 3 percentage points on top of that if held for 10 years, which can add up to a lot for larger deals \u2014 especially for projects that already looked good to begin with. And because of how those zones were selected in the first place, plenty of projects fit that description. Tracts could qualify as relatively poor and low-income based on Census statistics from 2011 to 2015, when many downtown areas had just started to redevelop. And the law allowed a few tracts to be chosen based on sharing a border with a qualifying tract, even if they weren't poor enough to make the cut. Downtown Los Angles seen from the Lincoln Heights neighborhood.For example: The entire core of downtown Phoenix is now an Opportunity Zone, including its convention center and sports stadiums. So is most of downtown Portland, Oregon, including its tony Pearl district, replete with clothing boutiques, vintage furniture stores and a Whole Foods. Large swaths of south Seattle and west Oakland adjacent to booming tech hubs, big chunks of long-gentrified Brooklyn and Harlem and even bits of lower Manhattan, about half of inner-city Philadelphia and Baltimore \u2014 all now confer generous tax benefits upon those who invest in businesses or real estate projects. In the hot real estate market of the last several years, those urban cores have been flooded with high-end condos and glassy office buildings. That creates a windfall for investors funding projects that they might have funded anyway. \"It's not going to make something feasible if it was infeasible to begin with,\" said Paul Silvern, partner in charge of the Los Angeles office of the real estate consulting firm HR&A Advisors. For some projects, he said, \"this is just icing on the cake.\" There's no official count of how many Opportunity Funds exist, nor how much money they've raised; the Treasury Department has so far declined to do any such tracking and a bill introduced by Booker and Scott to require it hasn't yet passed. A running tally by the real estate consulting firm Novogradac puts the number at 134, and it captures only those that have been publicly announced \u2014 most of which are raising enormous sums to deploy in a basket of projects. The largest known fund, run by LA-based CIM Group, is looking for $5 billion.If you believe that markets work, then deploying capital in such a way that makes a successful project by definition means that you are improving the community,\"\n\nALEX BHATHAL, FOUNDER OF RAJ CAPITALOn their websites, the fund managers advertise potentially lucrative investment opportunities like industrial warehouse spaces, data centers and vacation rentals. Defenders of the program often say that investment is inherently good for communities, regardless of what it's for, because of the jobs they create and ancillary businesses they might foster. Alex Bhathal's family co-owns the Sacramento Kings basketball franchise, for which they developed a stadium and sports district in downtown Sacramento. He's now running a fund called RevOZ Capital, and said he is vetting a pipeline of more than 100 possible deals all over the country. \"If you believe that markets work, then deploying capital in such a way that makes a successful project by definition means that you are improving the community,\" said Bhathal. \"The increase in economic activity, the increase in tax base, does have a multiplier effect.\" Effie Turnbull Sanders runs the South Los Angeles Transit Empowerment Zone, which is hoping to attract funding for affordable housing, pharmacies, grocery stores, childcare centers and sit-down restaurants that serve locals.Plenty of people are skeptical of that assessment, though. At the moment, high-end housing is already displacing long-term, mostly African-American residents in neighborhoods like Crenshaw. In the census tract that covers its commercial strip, the median household income is less than $22,000 and 1-in-4 households receive food stamps, but in the wider neighborhood the average home value has risen from $366,000 in 2012 to $852,000 last month, according to the real estate website Zillow. The late rapper Nipsey Hussle had been planning his own Opportunity Fund that would source capital locally and do projects of interest to the community, according to the Los Angeles Times. Hussle was gunned down in late March. Effie Turnbull Sanders is the executive director of the South L.A. Transit Empowerment Zone, a consortium of local nonprofits that won an Obama-era contest for extra help with economic development priorities like job training, small business investment and crime prevention. About half the geographic area her group covers now falls into Opportunity Zones, and they're organizing to pull capital into affordable housing, pharmacies, grocery stores, childcare centers, and sit-down restaurants that serve locals. Without community involvement, she worries that outside investors will flood the neighborhood looking for only the most lucrative deals. \"We're hopeful that with our efforts this could support our goals and residents' interests,\" Sanders said. \"But without guardrails, it could be potentially devastating.\"'We can't afford to be cynical' States and localities can't create much in the way of guardrails for Opportunity Zones. The 2017 federal law on which the zones are based provided for only minimal local oversight of projects, and neither party in Washington seems interested in amending it. But they're still trying to make the best of it. One strategy: Sweetening the pot for particular types of projects by pouring additional tax breaks on top of the federal incentive.Maryland, for example, extended a large slate of tax breaks to Opportunity Zones and allowed localities to slash property taxes for projects on vacant lots. Alabama passed legislation that would deepen tax benefits for tech companies and grant tax breaks for projects that underperform expectations in order to \"de-risk\" investment in marginal areas. Many states also subsidize Opportunity Zones indirectly, since their laws conform to federal tax rates, either automatically or by act of the legislature. Still, no amount of tax forgiveness will get a deal done if investors don't know the specific opportunity exists, and many investors are not used to working in distressed communities. That's why local governments and nonprofits are also trying to surface investable projects, and speed their progress forward through thickets of zoning approvals. Michael Banner, of the Los Angeles Local Development Corporation, has watched economic development programs come and go for decades. Dozens of cities, for example, have created investor prospectuses with all the available properties in Opportunity Zones, and ready-to-go projects that just need capital to get moving. Los Angeles is in the process of creating one, and Deputy Mayor for Economic Development Billy Chun pledges to work with developers to ease the cumbersome entitlement process for projects on the list. \"We have no way to dictate what they do,\" Chun said. \"We just have to put it out there, to try to make it easier for investors to do affordable projects, rather than market rate. If we set the narrative with the private market, and really showcase, 'This is the right way to do things,' meaning talk to us, work with us, there's a value add that we can help with.\"Investors may turn their attention to such projects after making it through their first round of low-hanging fruit. But Michael Banner, who has watched economic development programs come and go in Los Angeles for decades and now runs the nonprofit Los Angeles Local Development Corporation, doubts that the Opportunity Zone designation will overcome pervasive caution about truly marginalized neighborhoods. \"Is the amount of incentive that I'm going to get enough to make me adjust my investment criteria, to say I'm covered for the additional risk?\" said Banner, who is seeking Opportunity Fund investment for a small office project in Lincoln Heights. \"I'm not so sure, from an institutional standpoint, that that's enough.\"What really tends to spur private investment, Banner thinks, is public investment \u2014 like renovating parks, building out light-rail systems, and planning large university and hospital campuses that tend to depend heavily on federal and state funding. \"It's hard to get private investors to show up without someone priming the ground,\" he said. By reducing both federal and local government tax revenue, the California Budget and Policy Center worries that Opportunity Zones will only make those public amenities harder to pay for. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has advertised Opportunity Zones as a holistic replacement for government subsidies. For example, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson told a congressional committee in April that maintenance funds weren't necessary for hundreds of thousands of public housing units because they were located in the favored Census tracts, which would draw in private investment. Houses line the street in the Crenshaw neighborhood of Los Angeles.There may still be a role for government in steering investment towards projects that wouldn't otherwise get it: Creating publicly-run Opportunity Funds. California Senate Majority Leader Robert Hertzberg, who represents the San Fernando Valley, would like the state itself to raise private capital and deploy it to desirable projects, especially those that are a priority to a local or state agency, that will still generate a reasonable return.The need is too great for people to cross their arms, raise their eyebrow, and say 'this isn't working.' This is a new way to get oceans of capital into places that really need it,\"Kunal Merchant, president of CalOz.Barring that, Opportunity Zone advocates point out examples of the tax break prompting local banks, companies and high-net-worth individuals to invest not in far-off metropolises, but rather in their own backyards. They know that not every project will be a paragon of community impact, and that plenty of investors will get richer by claiming the tax break on projects they would have funded even without it. But the tax break is not going away, they point out, and the outcome will depend on people working diligently to channel private capital into places it might not go of its own accord. \"We can't afford to be cynical,\" said Kunal Merchant, president of an advocacy group for California Opportunity Zones called CalOZ. \"The need is too great for people to cross their arms, raise their eyebrow, and say 'this isn't working.' This is a new way to get oceans of capital into places that really need it.\"",

        "content": "Disney Imagineer Scott Trowbridge and I are sitting next to the Millennium Falcon. The ship is scarred with blast marks and rust; by all indications it's the same ship that made the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs. You know: a piece of junk.Of course, we're not in a galaxy far, far away, we're in Anaheim, California, and the behemoth near us isn't a real spaceship. But starting Friday, when Disney's new Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge opens to the public, Trowbridge \u2014 the creative force behind the land \u2014 wants guests to forget about that for a while. \n\n\n\n\"We want the place to feel deep, so that your relationship with it can also have that kind of depth,\" Trowbridge says, motioning around what Disney calls the Black Spire Outpost \u2014 a bustling trading port on the planet Batuu. Trowbridge is speaking as if everything around him is, in fact, real. He's doing this not just because Disney's parks run on the belief in Disney magic, but because all of it must feel real in order to sell this new land to millions of Star Wars fans (a finicky bunch) and Disney park-goers (even finickier).That's especially important now. This December, the Skywalker era of Star Wars will be over. Disney is now trying to prove that the franchise is much more than just the family drama of Luke, Leia and descendents like Kylo Ren. It's betting that Galaxy's Edge will help do that.Disney calls the land the company's largest expansion at its parks ever. Its Imagineers are using innovative technology and spare-no-expense design to wrap guests into an experience. There will be a ride that allows guests to fly the Millennium Falcon, shops that allow them to build their own lightsabers, and restaurants that will serve galactic fare like fried Endorian tip-yip \u2014 or, as we like to call it, chicken.Guests at Galaxy's Edge will be able to pilot the Millennium Falcon on a ride called Smuggler's Run.Read MoreFor Disney, Galaxy's Edge represents an investment in the future, but it's also a reflection of something that has been one of the company's core strengths since it was envisioned by Walt Disney himself.For most of its history, Disney's success as a media powerhouse has relied on what company executives and MBA professors have long referred to as \"synergies\" \u2014 complementary businesses that don't just thrive on their own, but also all work in service of one another. Other companies have of course adopted similar strategies and used their various subsidiaries in this way. But Disney has practically made it into an art form. Take Marvel, which Disney has owned since 2009. First Marvel makes a comic book series, which creates characters and stories and develops a fanbase for them. Then Disney makes a movie out of those comics. The stars of that movie go on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live,\" the main late night show on ABC, which Disney also owns, to talk about it. Then, having proved that Marvel characters can thrive on the screen, Disney makes Marvel TV shows and sells them to rivals like Netflix. Later it makes a new movie, and uses \"Monday Night Football,\" the biggest show on ESPN, which Disney also owns, to unveil a trailer. Then Disney decides to start a Netflix competitor, and it uses new Marvel shows as well as those old Marvel movies (which it ensures people won't be able to see elsewhere) as a draw. All the while, it's running special cruises on its cruise line featuring characters from the Marvel movies, creating whole new theme lands dedicated to Marvel \u2014 and, of course, making new comics and toys that reference the movies.The theme parks are one of the most important gears in Disney's synergy machine. It's the same basic idea: create or repurpose a story people love, build a deeper connection through an attraction, sell merchandise that lets them take the experience home, maybe create a blockbuster film franchise out of one of the rides, make a ton of cash, repeat. The Skywalker saga, which started with Luke, Leia and Han in 1977, ends in December.With Galaxy's Edge, Disney can move further toward realizing the full potential of the $4 billion it spent in 2012 to acquire Lucasfilm, which owns Star Wars and Indiana Jones. And it can \u2014 it hopes \u2014 future-proof Star Wars even as the Skywalkers' family drama comes to an end. If it works, that strategy will bring generations of new fans in to Star Wars, helping the company compete against Netflix and other rivals in a splintered and hypercompetitive media landscape. It's not just about synergies, though. For a long time, Disney's media networks division, including ABC, ESPN and the Disney Channel, has been the company's biggest money maker, but it has come under pressure in recent years. Disney may one day soon need the theme parks to pick up some of the slack.Of course, for that to happen, they'll also need fans to embrace a Star Wars story that doesn't include the Skywalkers.     'Everything has to feel real'In building Galaxy's Edge, Disney reportedly spent $1 billion to fill up 14 acres inside Disneyland with state-of the-art rides, food and merchandise that can be personalized. (A second location, in Disney World, opens at the end of August.) Guests can quench their thirst with blue milk, one of Luke Skywalker's drinks of choice, and visit Oga's Cantina \u2014 the first bar in Disneyland other than the private Club 33 to serve alcohol. Custom bottles of Coca-Cola, served in the land, will look like little droids and feature labels written in Aurebesh \u2014 a fictional language used in the film franchise.\"For those guests who want to play Star Wars with us, we have ways,\" Trowbridge said. That deeper personalization will be made possible by technology including the Play Disney Parks app, which guests can download on their smartphones, and the resort's all-in-one bracelet, MagicBand. Oga's Cantina is the first bar to serve alcohol at Disneyland outside the private Club 33.When guests pilot the Millennium Falcon, which they'll do on the ride Smuggler's Run, their choices will impact their experiences in the rest of Galaxy's Edge. For example, if a guest loses cargo on the ride, Trowbridge said, the bartender at Oga's Cantina might issue a warning: \"I'd watch out if I were you, because I think your name's on the list of the local bounty hunter.\" Smuggler's Run will also use real-time video rendering technology created by legendary visual effects company Industrial Light & Magic, a branch of Lucasfilm. That technology will react to how the guests use the ride's 200 cockpit controls.Think of it this way: You could have gone to Disneyland and ridden Peter Pan's Flight any number of times over the past 64 years \u2014 but you could never be Peter Pan. At Galaxy's Edge, Disney wants you to feel like Han Solo.And that's only one of the land's most innovative rides. Guests will be able to build their own personal droids.Rise of the Resistance, which will open later this year, is what Trowbridge calls the \"biggest attraction we've ever built.\" Disney hasn't revealed much about the ride, but we do know it will have multiple ride systems, full-sized AT-AT Walkers and even a John Williams score. Disney CEO Bob Iger calls the ride \"the most technologically advanced and immersive attraction that we have ever imagined.\" \"We're pushing the limits of imagination and innovation,\" he said at Disney's annual shareholder meeting in March. \"We'll actually blur the lines for our guests between fantasy and reality and put them right in the middle of the rebellion and give them an active role in a fight against the First Order.\" For some guests in the future, the experience will be so encompassing that they won't even leave the Star Wars galaxy to sleep. Disney is planning a full-service Star Wars-themed hotel, which will one day open near Disney World's Hollywood Studios and will have characters and storylines as well as a starship design.\"Everything has to feel real,\" Trowbridge said. \"We want there to be stuff for you to surprise you, to make you feel like you've actually walked into this universe of Star Wars.\"First Order Stormtroopers signal that Galaxy's Edge takes place during the current film trilogy.     From Sleeping Beauty's Castle to the Millennium FalconDisney could've just created a Millennium Falcon ride and lines likely would have been hours long. Instead, the company created an entire world with different locales and characters. Rather than touring familiar places like Tatooine or Cloud City, guests will find themselves in Batuu. Instead of Harrison Ford's Han Solo, they'll find an animatronic version of Hondo Ohnaka, a pirate introduced in the \"Star Wars Rebels\" animated series, signing park-goers up for Smuggler's Run. \"There's a risk that people will get in there and go, 'Hey, where is Luke Skywalker? Where's Darth Vader? I want to see that,\" said Robert Niles, editor of ThemeParkInsider.com. \"If people come away disappointed because they're not just reflecting an old experience then that could create a bit of a chilling effect on trying to expand the franchise.\"So why not just create a land full of characters and hot spots that fans already know and love?Walt Disney points to sketches of Sleeping Beauty's Castle in 1955, four years before the company released the animated film. Well, it's actually a smart move by Disney to expand the series beyond the family drama of the Skywalkers. Visitors build a stronger connection to the brand when they are front and center as opposed to an observer in this Star Wars universe, Niles said.\"Now, if a Star Wars show comes on Disney+ and the characters say, 'we're going to Black Spire Outpost,' consumers may say, 'Hey, wait a minute, I've been there before,\" he said. \"Disney wants to be directly relevant to every consumer, every day.\"Disney not only wants to boost its theme park revenue, Niles said, but also the company wants Galaxy's Edge to have an effect on other ancillary parts of the company.\"It's all about, at its heart, Disney positioning itself as a lifestyle brand,\" he said. \"It is part of your lifestyle so much so that you incorporate Disney in pretty much everything you do, from making Mickey Mouse waffles in the morning to watching Disney+ at night.\"This general idea is nothing new for Disney. The company's theme parks have long been one of the strongest extensions of Disney's corporate universe, showcasing its existing intellectual property and serving as a breeding ground for new storylines and characters.In some cases, the theme parks market films and other content. For example, Adventureland, one of Disneyland's original themed lands, was based on Disney's award-winning nature film series, \"True-Life Adventures.\" Walt Disney himself named Disneyland's focal point \"Sleeping Beauty's Castle\" in 1955, four years before the company was due to release the animated feature \"Sleeping Beauty.\" In other cases, the complementary relationship has worked the other way, with the theme parks feeding content to Disney's vast array of other businesses. \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" started as a ride in 1967. More than 35 years later, it spawned a $4.5 billion film franchise that then influenced new rides around the world. Disney has also tried this model with \"The Haunted Mansion\" and will attempt it again next year with \"Jungle Cruise,\" a film starring Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt.    \n\nA 1957 map outlining Disney's synergies at the time. Disney\n\n\nDisney's slate of upcoming films also corresponds with two of its major parks projects, Galaxy's Edge and Pandora \u2014 The World of Avatar, which opened in 2017. The company announced earlier this month that it would alternate releases of new \"Star Wars\" and \"Avatar\" films each December between 2021 and 2027.Galaxy's Edge is also a major investment in the future of Disney's parks division at a time when that division looks more important to the future of the whole company. Profits in Disney's media networks hit a high in 2015, but have since declined 15%, likely due to cord-cutting and rising programming costs, neither of which promise to improve soon. In that same period, profits for Disney's parks and resorts have gone up 47%.It's no wonder, then, why Disney is investing so heavily in the parks, even beyond the Galaxy's Edge expansion. It's adding new attractions to Epcot including a \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" roller coaster and a ride based on \"Ratatouille,\" building new Marvel-themed areas at Disney's California Adventure, Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland and a \"Zootopia\"-themed land in Shanghai's Disneyland Park.     \"This has become one of our most profitable businesses as we've expanded around the world. And that has justified greater investment,\" Iger said in an interview with CNN Business' Christine Romans.As its theme parks become more important to its bottom line, Disney also needs to invest in them in order to keep its competitors in that space at bay. Comcast's Universal Studios shook up the theme park industry in 2010 with the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, an interactive land set in the story of Harry Potter. \"I think Wizarding World encouraged Disney to be as aggressive as they are being with Galaxy's Edge,\" Niles said. \"Disney doesn't want anyone to say, 'Oh, Universal's the creative leader in this industry because Harry Potter was so good.'\"The Wizarding World of Harry Potter allowed guests to purchase magic wands for use in the park, drink Butterbeer, the frothy butterscotch-flavored beverage from the series, and ride the Hogwarts Express train. It was a gamechanger in the theme park industry, and Disney didn't want to be outdone, Niles said.     \"With Harry Potter it no longer became acceptable for a top-level attraction just to be a standalone ride in this kind of mildly decorated area. You had to create an experience that brought you into a world from the moment you stepped foot into it,\" he said. \"So Disney had to create something that was not just their most immersive thing, but the most immersive thing.\" Trip Miller, a Disney shareholder and managing partner at hedge fund Gullane Capital Partners, describes theme parks as the \"Rock of Gibraltar\" for Disney \u2014 safer and more stable than the media side of the business. \"The media side is just so rapidly changing, so whether Galaxy's Edge turns out really well for them or it's just kind of a mediocre capex spend, I think there's very little risk,\" he said.     May the Force be with you... AlwaysWe already know what Star Wars is capable of. The space saga has made more than $9 billion at the global box office since 1977. Accounting for inflation, five of the top twenty highest-grossing films in North American box office history are Star Wars movies. The original \"Star Wars\" alone made more than $1.6 billion domestically \u2014 second only to \"Gone with the Wind\" in the United States after inflation.Those numbers don't include the costs to produce and market the films, but they also don't account for all the other ways Disney has already made money off the universe, like TV shows, licensing, home video sales and merchandise. When \"Force Awakens\" hit theaters in 2015, analysts estimated that the merchandise tied to the film could generate $5 billion in sales within a year. Jeff Bock, a senior box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations, wouldn't take a guess at how much the brand is now worth to Disney, but said the company \"wouldn't sell 'Star Wars' for $25 billion at this point.\"Of course, because it's Disney, there are several other major Star Wars projects in the works beyond Galaxy's Edge. There are new films coming from \"Game of Thrones\" creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss. And there's a new live-action series: \"The Mandalorian,\" which follows a Boba Fett-esque bounty hunter. \"The Mandalorian\" will air on the company's upcoming streaming service, Disney+ \u2014 part of its strategy to use its huge library of beloved content, characters and worlds to draw users to Disney+ and away from competitors like Netflix.\n\n\n\nBut the franchise is now at an inflection point. Disney would very much like Star Wars to live on past the nine movies that George Lucas envisioned and the family he created. Galaxy's Edge is a physical manifestation of that hope and its strategy, said Suzanne Scott, an assistant professor at the University of Texas' Moody College of Communication.\"If Galaxy's Edge had been set on Tatooine, fans would have enjoyed scrutinizing every detail against its cinematic counterpart,\" she said. \"In creating Black Spire Outpost, they get all the appeal and familiarity of a spaceport/border planet, plus all of the creative freedom.\"That creative freedom allows Disney and Trowbridge to do more than just create a new world for Star War fans to enjoy \u2014 the land also presents a stepping off point for all kinds of new Star Wars experiences, memories, stories and, of course, profits too. \"We have so many stories we want to tell,\" Trowbridge told me as we sat looking around Galaxy's Edge. \"That's one of the great things about Star Wars. There will never be an end to the number of Star Wars stories that we can tell.\"Art Direction: Allie SchmitzEditors: Annalyn Kurtz and An PhungPhoto Editors: Brett Roegiers and Natalie Yubas",

        "content": "(CNN Business)US stocks are back at all-time highs as the longest bull market in American history continues its record-setting run.How much longer can the good times roll?It's anyone's guess, but bull markets and economic expansions don't die of old age. Credit crunches, political uncertainty, wars and rampant speculation have ended previous bull markets.Overall, the S&P 500 has gained 334% in the 121 months since its Great-Recession low in March 2009. Bull markets occur when stocks gain at least 20% from their most recent low. Since the Great Depression, that's happened 12 other times to the S&P 500, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices.Here's how they each came to an end.     Read More1932 to 1937: Recovery from the Great DepressionIt took several years for financial markets to start recovering from the Great Depression, the deepest recession in modern American history. The Composite Price Index, a predecessor to the S&P 500, fell 86% between September 1929 and June 1932, but then followed that slump with 325% gains over the next five years.The bull market was supported in part by President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, which unleashed massive government spending programs to stabilize the economy. But four years later, Roosevelt pulled back on those programs. He slashed spending to balance the budget. Around the same time, the Federal Reserve tightened its reserve ratios for banks. Its timing was off. The economy hadn't fully recovered from the Great Depression yet, and tighter monetary and fiscal policy led to a double-dip recession, often called Roosevelt's recession.From March 1937 to April 1942, stocks declined 60%.Unemployed men eat soup and bread at a cafeteria circa 1935.1942 to 1946: World War II drives economic activityThe United States entered World War II in December 1941 after Japanese bombers attacked Pearl Harbor. American factories ramped up production of tanks, machine guns and fighter planes. Women, who previously had been discouraged from working outside their homes, took over manufacturing jobs as men went abroad to fight. Fueled by the war effort, the S&P 500 gained 158% from April 1942 to May 1946.The sudden jolt to the economy wasn't sustainable. Americans eventually cut back on spending and ramped up their savings, which led to a minor economic slowdown known as an inventory recession. From May 1946 to June 1949, the S&P 500 fell 30%.In 1942, these factory workers cleaned Merlin engines to be used in bombers and fighter aircraft.1949 to 1956: The post-war economy boomsAfter the war ended, the United States enjoyed an era of prosperity. President Dwight Eisenhower focused on balancing the federal budget. Consumerism flourished, propelled by the idea of the American Dream and a suburban utopia, complete with automobiles and television sets for every family. Americans had more children, fueling what would later become known as the Baby Boom. The S&P 500 gained 266% between June 1949 and August 1956.The stock market boomed so much that by 1955, lawmakers feared it could end in a 1929-like bust. The Senate Banking Committee launched a \"friendly\" inquiry into the stock market, to consider whether new regulations were needed. That same year, Federal Reserve Chairman William McChesney Martin, Jr., delivered a famous speech likening the central bank to a chaperone that needs to take away the \"punch bowl\" just as a party is warming up. The central bank raised interest rates and economic growth slowed. The Suez Canal crisis and the Soviet Union's invasion of Hungary added to uncertainty fueling the minor bear market. From August 1956 to October 1957, the S&P 500 fell 22%.An American family, posing in their yard in Los Angeles in 1952.1957 to 1961: The Cold War ramps upIn 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first man-made satellite to orbit Earth. US stocks declined as American leaders worried that their country was losing the Cold War. But after a short-lived bear market, the S&P 500 enjoyed nearly four years of growth, gaining 86% between October 1957 and December 1961.When the bull market eventually fizzled out, it wasn't entirely unexpected. As a young Warren Buffett noted at the time, \"stocks have been rising at rather rapid rates. Corporate earnings have not been rising. Dividends have not been increasing.\" In other words, stocks were overvalued and a decline was warranted. Stocks declined 28% between December 1961 and June 1962.Nikita Khrushchev, center, who led the Soviet Union during the first part of the Cold War, stands in front of a model of Sputnik III.1962 to 1966: JFK aims to 'get America moving again'On the campaign trail, President John Kennedy had promised to \"get America moving again,\" but after he took office in 1961, tensions flared between the president and the steel industry, leading to a brief bear market known as the Kennedy Slide. Stocks eventually started picking up again in 1962.Later, in 1963, the bull market was dealt a scare when Kennedy was assassinated. The S&P 500 plummeted nearly 3% that day and trading was shut down two hours early to honor JFK's memory. But Wall Street rebounded swiftly, with the market recovering all its losses just days later. The market expansion endured for nearly three more years. Heading into 1966, the economy was strong. Unemployment was just 4% and companies were rushing to fill large back-orders for goods. But when inflation started picking up, the Federal Reserve responded by tightening credit conditions. The move proved too restrictive and triggered a credit crunch. The S&P 500 fell 22% from February to October 1966.Wall Street rebounded after President John F. Kennedy was assasinated in 1963.1966 to 1968: The go-go yearsSpanning barely two years, the mid-1960s bull market was the shortest in modern American history. But the S&P 500 still managed to soar nearly 50% during the run. nThe stock market was boosted in part by a robust job market. By late 1968, the unemployment rate was just 3.4%. But the period was also marked by social and political earthquakes.1968 marked a turning point for the Vietnam War, when the North Vietnamese launched a surprise attack known as the Tet Offensive. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Robert Kennedy were assassinated, and in November, Richard Nixon won the presidential election. Instability, coupled with a weakening economy and high inflation, led to a bear market and a minor recession. The S&P 500 fell 36% from November 1968 to May 1970. The late 1960s were a tumultous time, marked by Vietnam War protests and the assasinations of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert Kennedy. But the US stock market posted strong gains anyway.1970 to 1973: Investors buy the Nifty Fifty McDonald's, IBM and Disney helped carry the American stock market to new heights in the early 1970s. Investors piled into the Nifty Fifty, a group of the country's largest and fastest-growing companies. The S&P 500 generated strong annual gains north of 23% on average during the bull market. But the mania eventually went too far. Valuations on Nifty Fifty stocks such as Polaroid and McDonald's were inflated to unsustainable levels.Then, in January 1973, President Nixon announced phase three of his economic plan, relaxing wage, price and rent controls he had enacted in earlier years. Although he asked businesses and workers to continue to follow the guidelines voluntarily, they seized upon the opportunity to raise prices and make wage demands. Runaway inflation followed. The S&P 500 declined 48% between January 1973 and October 1974.Companies like McDonald's, IBM and Disney \u2014 which were part of a group of fast-growing stocks called the Nifty Fifty \u2014 carried US stocks to new heights in the early 1970s.1974 to 1980: A modest bullThe stock market didn't exactly go gangbusters during this bull market between 1974 and 1980. The S&P 500 generated annual returns of just 14% on average, the weakest of the modern era, as investors grappled with the 1970s oil crisis.Amid double-digit inflation, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker quickly ratcheted up interest rates to as high as 20% in the early 1980s. While that strategy, known as the Volcker Shock, succeeded in taming price increases, it also made it more expensive to borrow money and ushered in a recession. The S&P 500 fell 27% between November 1980 and August 1982.The stock market went up in the mid 1970s, even as the US economy grappled with high oil prices and runaway inflation. Long lines became common at gas stations, as gasoline prices exceeded $1 a gallon for the first time in history.1982 to 1987: ReaganomicsAfter Volcker tamed inflation, President Ronald Reagan cut taxes, sending the stock market soaring. The S&P 500 boomed, generating average annual returns of nearly 27% \u2014 the best since during the Great Depression. And the unemployment rate broke below 6%, down from a peak of nearly 11%. But the bull market would end in an instant as the Dow crashed an astonishing 22.6% on October 19, 1987, a day now known as Black Monday.Computerized trading, which was still relatively new, was partly to blame. The bear market was super short, lasting only three months. While the S&P 500 fell nearly 34% between late August and early December, it still finished the year in positive territory.The 1980s were a good time for the US stock market, as investors welcomed tax cuts passed by President Ronald Reagan.1987 to 1990: The Black Monday comebackAfter Wall Street's darkest day proved to be just a blip for stocks, the S&P 500 advanced 65% from December 1987 to July 1990, marking the second shortest bull market in the modern era before another downturn struck. The United States entered a mild recession in July 1990 as oil prices more than doubled after Iraq invaded Kuwait.Between July and October 1990, the S&P 500 fell 19.9%, making it a borderline bear market because it fell just shy of a 20% drop.In one of the most dramatic days in Wall Street history, stocks crashed more than 20% on October 19, 1987. But it was just a blip for the market.1990 to 2000: Roaring 90sThe end of the Cold War and the dawn of the Internet Age ushered in an era of enormous prosperity. The S&P 500 surged more than 400% over the decade, driven higher by robust economic growth and stable inflation. It remains the strongest bull market ever. The United States experienced the longest period of uninterrupted economic growth in modern history. Investors, sensing the enormous potential of the internet, recklessly piled into dot-com stocks in what Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan dubbed \"irrational exuberance.\" Eventually, frothy share prices were no longer justified by underlying business fundamentals. Many of these companies, like Pets.com, went belly-up. The S&P 500 fell 49% between March 2000 and October 2002.Early tech companies like Microsoft boomed during the 1990s, fueling huge stock market gains. 2002 to 2007: Housing boomThe mid-2000s bull market planted the seeds for the meltdown that would arrive later in the decade. Aided by low interest rates from the Greenspan-led Federal Reserve, the period was marked by excessive leverage. Subprime mortgages enabled more Americans to purchase homes often with no down payment and at short-term \"teaser\" rates. The real estate market surged and rising home values led Americans to spend aggressively. Stocks rose 102% between October 2002 and 2007. But Wall Street made risky bets that eventually backfired.When home prices starting falling, borrowers began defaulting en masse. Investment banks like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, which held some of the risky subprime debt, suffered huge losses and collapsed. The deepest financial crisis and recession since the Great Depression followed, with the S&P 500 falling nearly 57% between October 2007 and March 2009. New home construction surged in the early aughts, driving a boom in the US economy and stock market. 2009 to now: Long, slow recoveryNo matter when it ends, the recovery from the Great Recession is already the longest bull market in American history. Spanning more than a decade, the market boom has been driven by a combination of slow-but-steady economic growth, record corporate profits and record low interest rates.The bull market, after surviving several near-death experiences, has catapulted to quadruple its crisis low. The record-setting rally has been punctuated by the rise of the tech industry, with Apple, Amazon and Google joining Microsoft as America's most valuable companies.A man tries a virtual reality game inside a 360-degree projection dome.

        "content": "Youngstown, Ohio (CNN Business)On the banks of the Mahoning River in Northeast Ohio, not far from where the first steel mill in the area once operated, sits a warehouse where the future of manufacturing is slowly taking shape. A massive 3D printer fills the space: A 12-foot by 25-foot steel plate on the floor is surrounded by 8-foot steel walls, and on top, a beam holds what looks like a giant ballpoint pen. Proprietor Michael Garvey has been test-running the machine on large hunks of black plastic, which could eventually take the shape of anything from a boat hull to an airplane wing. It's a far cry from the noisy, belching metal industries that once employed tens of thousands of people here \u2014 but local leaders are trying to make 3D printing technology as important to their economy as the Bessemer steel process was decades ago.Although 3D printing is currently just a side project for Garvey, he plans to scale the business rapidly. He's already staked out a facility where he can put several more of these gigantic, room-sized printers, fed by melted-down plastic pellets, which he figures he can bring in by railcar loads. Michael Garvey, CEO of M7 Technologies, stands next to one of the biggest 3D printers in the world in Youngstown, Ohio.Unlike Silicon Valley, which has scant experience with heavy manufacturing, this faded industrial hub has all the know-how necessary to reinvent how America makes things in the future.Read More\"With our history in Youngstown, we've got to learn how to adapt,\" Garvey said. \"We have the skill sets that we developed in a legacy industry, and we're transitioning those skill sets to more of a 21st century digital environment.\" History is one thing, but it's also Youngstown, Ohio's present, with the closure this week of the Mahoning Valley's last major manufacturer: General Motors' Lordstown Chevy Cruze assembly plant, which employed 4,500 people as recently as 2017, plus thousands of others at local suppliers that will also shut down as a result. We are a community at risk. And if we don't get involved in Industry 4.0 in a substantial way, we're pretty much sealing our fate.\"\nMichael Garvey, entrepreneur in Youngstown, OhioIn recent years, the federal government has poured money into a lively collaboration between academics and industry focused on preserving US manufacturing for the next generation. And plenty of existing companies are adopting other new technologies to get leaner and more productive. But even if they succeed, the thousands of solid, middle-class jobs that local residents could get from GM with just a high school diploma probably aren't coming back. Rather, the new manufacturing industry will require a smaller number of highly-educated engineers, programmers and machine operators \u2014 the types of skills that today are in short supply not just in the US, but around the world. A factory in Youngstown, one of the great steel cities of the early 20th century.Garvey came back to Youngstown from a trading floor job on Wall Street in the 1980s to rescue his father's bronze foundry, which had suffered along with the steel mills that used to line the river. He started a company that allowed those plants to run more efficiently by measuring imprecisions in the operation of their machinery, thereby reducing downtime. The giant printer project will ultimately run using robots that talk to each other with little human involvement, known in manufacturing jargon as \"Industry 4.0.\" It's part of a progression that started with water and steam power, advanced with electricity, leapt forward with computer chips, and now involves devices communicating with each other and learning on their own through artificial intelligence. It may employ fewer people per widget produced, but the way Garvey sees it, the area has no other option. \"We are a community at risk,\" he said. \"And if we don't get involved in Industry 4.0 in a substantial way, we're pretty much sealing our fate.\"The Silicon Valley of 3D printingThe Mahoning Valley's transformation began in earnest in 2012, as the number of manufacturing workers in the area started rising from an all-time low, when the Obama administration put one of its five National Manufacturing Institutes in Youngstown. This one was focused on a process called \"additive\" manufacturing \u2014 i.e., 3D printing. The local business incubator, which had been trying to nurture information technology startups, pivoted to focus on advanced manufacturing. So did Youngstown State University, which lured some of the best faculty in the field with more than $10 million worth of equipment. Products made by a 3D printing machine in Youngstown, where a local business incubator focuses on advanced manufacturing.That model, bringing in federal funding and academic brainpower, is one that's worked well before in developing innovation clusters and enriching communities down the line. Silicon Valley, for example, couldn't have happened without the US Department of Defense buying the microchips that Bay Area companies started to produce, or if Stanford University hadn't fostered entrepreneurs who then patented technologies and spun out their own companies.3D printing has been around for a decade now, and it's still often seen as a novelty way to pump out plastic trinkets and models. People working with the technology in Youngstown, however, saw the machines as a way to extend and enhance the region's existing industrial base, strengthening the mom-and-pop machine shops that still dot the city like corner pubs. Take the production of all the devices needed to make things out of metal, like gauges, clamps and drill bits. Traditionally, tools and other parts are cast with molds made out of sand, producing rough steel forms that have to be further sanded down. They take several steps and sometimes weeks to make, can break easily and aren't able to handle delicate details.That's why some startups at the Youngstown Business Incubator specialize in 3D printing the molds for those tools \u2014 which can take a tenth of the time \u2014 and are working with big manufacturers to incorporate the process into their production lines. In 2014, a Youngstown State graduate named Zac DiVencenzo started a company called Juggerbot 3D at the incubator. He works with plastics companies like DSM Additive to align his products as closely as possible to what equipment manufacturers are looking for: A quick way to experiment with and produce parts, from gearboxes to pump houses. Youngstown is an ideal location, he said, as it's less than a few hours drive from plenty of big assembly plants. \"My partners might not be as close,\" DiVencenzo said, \"but my customers are.\" Zac DiVencenzo, COO of Juggerbot 3D, stands next to a 3D printer.On top of making precision parts and molds for heavy manufacturing, Juggerbot sells its own proprietary 3D printer, and is experimenting with medical devices and surgical implants, like a prosthetic knee socket or a perfectly-fitted shoe insert, that can be printed to order. Other activities at the incubator include producing spare parts for the US Air Force's older airplanes that it can't get anywhere else, and soon, 3D printing eyeglasses to fit peoples' features based on a facial scan. The point to all these endeavors is to create a flexible manufacturing base that can adapt to customers' needs quickly, rather than the rigid assembly line at the now-shuttered GM plant in Lordstown. That plant is configured to only be able to manufacture one model of car, and shifting to something different would require millions of dollars of investment, plus months of idle time. Incorporating additive manufacturing is also a way for smaller Youngstown companies to remain resilient and make products at a lower cost, so that when downturns come or a large client moves away, they can pivot to other markets. Factories like a large aluminum can manufacturer have gotten in touch with Youngstown State to see if there are ways they can incorporate 3D printing into their operations. \"They know their world is going to change too,\" said Jim Tressel, president of Youngstown State. \"Don't know how. But they know, like Thomas Edison said, 'there's a better way, find it.'\" If Youngstown can turn itself into a 3D-printing manufacturing base, it will still be smaller scale and more distributed, rather than relying on enormous tent-pole companies of years past. It won't be as visible to the outside world \u2014 but it will be less vulnerable to the whims of any one institution.3D printing machines in the Youngstown Business Incubator.\"Lordstown is very unfortunate. However, it's the thing that everybody sees every day,\" said Ethan Karp, director of a coalition of manufacturers called MAGNET. \"What they don't see is the wide world of much smaller companies in our region that are healthy and growing and improving.\"Of course, there's no guarantee that getting an edge in additive manufacturing will turn around Youngstown's fortunes. Even if the area becomes a global center of 3D printing innovation \u2014 YSU is hosting a worldwide conference on the technology in 2020 \u2014 other places are also pursuing the technology, and competition for talent is fierce. That's why the university is also investing in research areas like natural gas extraction and biomechanical engineering, just to hedge its bets.\"I think it's our big stack of chips,\" said Mike Hripko, vice president of external affairs for Youngstown State, of 3D printing. \"But it's not our only stack of chips.\" Fewer man-hours, more robotsEven if technology allows manufacturing to continue in the Mahoning Valley \u2014 whether through 3D printing or other advanced techniques \u2014 it likely still won't be the jobs dynamo that the automakers and the steel mills were at their peak. Vallourec, a French producer of steel pipes that employs 750 people on the site of the former Youngstown Sheet and Tube factory, has been automating production and removing human hands from the most dangerous parts of its process for years now. Eric Shuster, the plant manager, said that threading pipes used to require a team of 10 workers, but now needs only seven or eight people. \"There is going to be some loss,\" he said. \"You have to expect that. We don't see the growth in the head count.\" Frank Deley is the president of Taylor-Winfield, a company that makes tools for manufacturers all over the world.Despite technological advancements that have cut down on the man-hours involved in manufacturing, the industry says it's in dire need of workers, because the economy is doing well and a generation of people who went into the profession decades ago is now retiring. Last fall, the job openings rate climbed to its highest point on record, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.That scarcity of trained workers, in turn, fuels further attempts to squeeze humans out of the process. Taylor-Winfield is a Youngstown-based company of 87 people that's been around for more than a century making tools and systems of tools for manufacturers all over the world. It has an R&D lab with sensors and lasers that allows teams of robots to turn out products with almost no human touch. \"What we hear time and time again is that hiring people throughout the country is difficult,\" said the company's president, Frank Deley. \"So once we figure out the process, we figure out how to automate it.\" Deley hires people from local universities, reasoning they usually have family ties to the area and won't just leave for a better salary somewhere on the coasts. It's a strategy many companies have had to rely on, since Ohio can be a difficult place to lure people to if they don't have some pre-existing relationship there. In recent years, the industry has been taking this problem into its own hands. Jack Schron runs a company called Jergens outside Cleveland, which produces hooks, racks and fasteners that hold things in place, from machines to concert speaker systems. The products haven't changed that much, but the process of making them has. One person now tends two giant machines at once, requiring specialized knowledge and extensive on-the-job training. Schron starts people as temps, hires them on if they work out, and moves them all around the factory floor as they learn new things. Larry McRae, a CNC machinist, works on the floor of Jergens, a manufacturing efficiency company in Cleveland.He's also been pushing for cooperation among manufacturers, like support for shared training programs. Their graduates might end up somewhere other than the company where they gained their skills, but overall, the pool of new recruits gets bigger.\"We trust that we'll get our fair share,\" Schron said. \"We have to wake up to the fact that manufacturing is not Lordstown. It's all of us working together.\"READ MORE ON GMAs GM's Lordstown plant idles, an iconic job nears extinctionRead the letters kids wrote to save their town's auto plantGM is getting rid of these 6 carsWithout GM, Lordstown, Ohio, will never be the sameAnd what about all the Lordstown employees being laid off? Even with manufacturers complaining loudly about how desperate they are for workers, the jobs they have to offer are often very different from the ones GM is cutting. For one thing, they'll require more education, which is available through various state and federal programs but difficult to undertake if you're already over 50 and were counting on being able to finish out your working years at the plant. It may mean starting over at the beginning, where years of seniority don't matter, and making far less than unionized auto workers did in the past. \"I think there will be some pain in that transition,\" said Glenn Richardson, managing director of advanced manufacturing at Jobs Ohio, the state's private sector economic development partner. \"If you're having to retrain, you're coming in at an entry-level position. But I think the potential is there to get back to that.\"And right now, there aren't a ton of training programs in 3D printing, given how new the technology is. Barb Ewing runs the Youngstown Business Incubator, and believes in the power of entrepreneurship to revitalize the local economy \u2014 but less is known about the power to create enough work for everyone. \"How do you prepare your community for jobs that don't even exist?\" she said.

        "content": "Lordstown, Ohio  (CNN Business)When Felice Robinson was hired at General Motors' Lordstown plant in 1995, she thought the rest of her life was taken care of.Robinson, who was then in her mid-20s, had been bouncing around a series of low-paid retail jobs when she learned the giant factory down the road was hiring. The assembly line position came with generous health care benefits, an hourly wage more than twice what she had been making at a menswear store, and the promise of a secure retirement \u2014 if she could hold on to the job for 30 years.\"It was a whole different world,\" Robinson, who's now 50, told CNN Business in late February. \"I couldn't believe how lucky I was, to be making that kind of money without a college degree.\" That world has been evaporating for decades now. On Wednesday, when the Lordstown plant will make its last Chevy Cruze and close its doors, it will get even smaller. Felice Robinson stands in her home in Warren, Ohio, after getting off of the night shift at work at the Lordstown GM plant.For GM, the move is part of an overall strategy to shift away from sedans and toward higher-margin trucks and light SUVs in an era of low gas prices. GM is also pouring money into electric and autonomous cars, which are still primarily in the research and development phase. And with GM's investment in a ridesharing platform called Maven, the company is looking forward to a future in which fewer people own vehicles at all. Read MoreFor workers, the transition means uncertainty, dislocation and immersion in a labor market with far fewer opportunities for those without training beyond a high school degree. As recently as the early 2000s, a job in an auto plant could be a launchpad to the middle class, but those jobs are increasingly rare. During the Lordstown plant's heyday in the 1970s, GM was one of the biggest private sector employers in the United States, with more than 618,000 employees. That number is now down to about 103,000. And the jobs that remain are not all what they once were. Since 1990, wages for US auto workers have declined 18%, adjusted for inflation. Retirement benefits have declined as well. As of 2017, only 8% of factories offered pensions.Those trends are especially pronounced in the Youngstown, Ohio region, an area about halfway between Cleveland and Pittsburgh in which Lordstown sits. Thirty years ago, about 1 out of 4 local workers were employed by the manufacturing industry. Now, less than half that many are. Since the beginning of the Great Recession, real hourly earnings have dropped by 8% in the area, while rising 11% in the rest of the country. Flags lined up outside of the Lordstown GM plant.All that has made GM jobs stick out: Full-time production workers make between $61,000 and $88,000 a year after only a couple years on the job, according to their United Auto Workers union contract, not including additional overtime pay and bonuses. That's well above the average wage in the Youngstown area, which was around $38,000 in 2017. Unlike during the Great Recession, GM is cutting these jobs \u2014 along with about 1,400 more hourly positions at US plants elsewhere \u2014 at a time when it's profitable and the national economy is strong. That's an indication that GM sees its future as one with fewer factory-floor workers, not more of them. And for the Youngstown area, losing the last major supplier of the type of jobs that made it a manufacturing powerhouse decades ago is a particularly symbolic blow.      About 400 of the 1,400 people who'll no longer go to work at GM's sprawling Lordstown complex after this week have accepted transfers to other plants, and will keep their healthcare and pensions. Other former workers at the plant, which used to run 24 hours a day, were not as fortunate. As demand for the Cruze weakened over the past two years, its second and third shifts were cut, and 3,000 people were laid off. Many of them won't be offered the same transfer opportunities this latest group will.GM says that 350 Lordstown workers are eligible for retirement, those who transfer will get $30,000 in relocation assistance, and that it's working to find new employment for anyone who wants it.

In the end, we made this decision at a point in time where we have the ability to offer opportunities to people who want to keep working for GM.\"Robinson thinks she probably has enough seniority to get a placement at one of GM's other facilities, like the metal fabrication plant in Cleveland or the transmission factory in Toledo. She dreads transferring \u2014 she'll have to leave her 68-year-old aunt who needs support, as well as the rest of her family and friends, and the town she's always called home. But she has little choice: Despite the strongest US labor market in a generation, the economy is not generating the types of jobs that GM offered her as a young woman. At least not in Youngstown. \"They have me by a chokehold. There's nothing I can do,\" Robinson said. \"I make $32 an hour. I'm not going to go get a $12-an-hour job. I couldn't survive on that at all. I'm going to get up and go, ride it out, try to get the best gig I can get, and be done with them.\" The 'good old days'The loss of General Motors won't be the first time the Youngstown area took a shock to the heart. It's been reeling ever since the sudden collapse of the local steel industry in the late 1970s, when competition from cheap imports \u2014 and the failure of American steel mills to compete \u2014 led to the disappearance of nearly 50,000 jobs over five years. The first woman member of the UAW Local 1112 works on the Vega production line in 1970.Through that time, the auto industry became something of a lifeline. The Lordstown plant, which opened in 1966, hired thousands of workers, and thousands more worked in smaller, independent machine shops that supplied auto parts to GM. The GM plant floated the local government, providing some $2 million a year in tax revenue, said Terry Armstrong, superintendent of the Lordstown school district. The Lordstown school campus, with its spacious lecture halls and a planetarium, was built without debt. It's just not the same company that I used to work for. It's so much more cutthroat, and it's meaner. I know that the old GM is gone.\"Felice Robinson, a GM employee for 24 yearsThe unionized jobs paid far above market, topping out in the $30-an-hour range, for reasonably humane tasks like installing seatbelt harnesses, securing engine brakes or driving forklifts. Former GM worker Tom Albright, who retired in 2015, remembers being able to do his work faster than the rest of the line and then relax. \"I could get ahead of the job for three hours, and at that point I could go goof off for three hours,\" said Albright, whose son still works in the plant. \"Those were the good old days. It ain't like that anymore. They get every nickel that they can out of that individual working that job on the floor.\" But then cracks started to show in the US auto industry, starting with competition from Japanese automakers in the 1980s and continuing with NAFTA in 1994. Employment slid, as work was outsourced to lower-paying suppliers, including plants in Mexico.      The Lordstown plant wasn't immune to the changes that have been affecting the workforce more broadly. In 2007, as the automakers were bleeding cash, the union accepted the creation of a lower wage tier for entry-level workers, meaning that they made 45% less per hour and got a 401(k) plan instead of a guaranteed pension. After GM's bankruptcy in 2009, workers told CNN Business, the job became harder, with management pressing for less downtime.\"Slowly but surely, they became less and less thoughtful about the people who worked for them,\" said Robinson. \"It's just not the same company that I used to work for. It's so much more cutthroat, and it's meaner. I know that the old GM is gone.\" But many in the community still recognize that those jobs feed families, donate to local charities and buy cars. They also generate other jobs: Since manufacturing brings in capital from outside the area rather than just recirculating it, each factory position is estimated to get three or four more people working in fields like healthcare, food service, retail and education. That's why, last fall, the United Auto Workers local 1112 and the region's chamber of commerce started the Drive it Home campaign \u2014 a community effort to post signs, send letters and work with politicians to convince GM to build another product at the Lordstown plant. It was meant to mimic another push two decades ago when Lordstown was in competition with other cities to win another car model to replace the Chevy Cavalier. That one worked, with the help of officials at the plant who joined the effort. Letters from elementary school kids hang inside the UAW Local 1112 hall in Warren, Ohio.\"The one difference is that this time plant management was not interested in participating,\" said James Dignan, president of the Youngstown/Warren Regional Chamber. \"The plant management used to be very engaged locally. But they're losing some of that tie and that feel from the company to the community.\"  Dignan said they're working to get another user for the plant if GM decides to give it up permanently.  But to the local union workers, getting another GM product is far preferable to getting another company. These are their jobs, and they'll likely still have more protections and higher wages than any other employer.For 24 years I've done nothing for this company and this union but bend over. This is all I've ever done. I never thought it would come to this.\" \nTammy Vennitti, a GM worker who was laid off in 2018\"We don't want Elon Musk coming in. We don't want Amazon building a distribution center,\" said David Green, who's been president of UAW Local 1112 since last May. He led another local within the plant in 2007 when the company asked to pay new workers lower wages. \"I supported that because the promise was product and job security,\" Green said. \"Do what we had to do to keep working, keep our communities and our families alive and thriving. It feels like they betrayed us a little bit.\"The Lordstown school district set up a community pantry to distribute food, clothes and supplies to families affected by the GM layoffs.So far, the company hasn't shown its cards \u2014 and the uncertainty is what gets to people. Why take a transfer, if it seems likely that Lordstown will get a new car within the next year and you could come back? For that matter, what new employer would take a chance on someone who would bail as soon as Lordstown re-opened? Plenty of people remember how GM re-opened its plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee in 2011 after having shuttered it two years earlier.That's why, for those who have the option, the choice of whether to go or stay is so agonizing \u2014 even though the job had its fair share of hardships.Tammy Vennitti, 55, was laid off with the second shift back in June last year. She had signed up for a training course in order to keep her supplemental unemployment benefits, and then put those plans on hold in January when GM called back those who'd been laid off to fill in for the people who were being moved out to other plants. Vennitti applied for a transfer to a plant in Toledo, and she doesn't know if she'll get it or whether she'd take it if she did, given that she lives with her 27-year-old daughter and 18-month-old granddaughter. But she needs the healthcare benefits to pay for the blood pressure pills her doctor put her on during the stress of being laid off for months, not to mention care for a body that took a beating over 24 years of lifting 30 to 40 pounds, 400 times a day. GM's gold-plated insurance paid for a shoulder replacement, carpal tunnel surgery and cortizone shots for a knee that had no more cartilage to cushion her bones. \"For 24 years I've done nothing for this company and this union but bend over,\" Vennitti said. \"This is all I've ever done. I never thought it would come to this.\" Tammy Vennitti sits in her friend's home in Newton Falls, Ohio. She was laid off and takes medicine to help with the stress of losing her job.The jobs of the futureWhat's next for employment in Youngstown? The local chamber of commerce said there are 13,000 job openings in the area. Team NEO, an economic development non-profit focused on Northeast Ohio, said there will be strong demand in the coming years for workers in information technology, healthcare and manufacturing. But unlike the manufacturing jobs of the past, which usually did not require education beyond high school, 65% of those jobs will require a post-secondary credential by 2021, the group estimates. There are plenty of training opportunities, since GM workers get assistance both from the state and the US Department of Commerce through trade adjustment assistance. So far, there's been strong interest in truck driving certificates, an Ohio state official said, since those take only a few weeks to get and pay relatively well.Some workers saw the end coming early and took steps to prepare. Trish Amato, 43, was hired too late to get a traditional pension, lessening the need to hang on to a GM job. She used GM's tuition benefits to finish her bachelor's degree and get a master's degree in special education. When she was laid off in 2018, Amato thought about going to the plant at Spring Hill, Tennessee. But she and her partner, whose truck driving job also depends on Lordstown being open, didn't think they could afford the rent in the booming area south of Nashville. Trish Amato, a laid-off GM worker herself, works at the UAW's transition center helping people access benefits and training opportunities.So instead, they're thinking of trading in his big rig for a motorhome and traveling the country, while she teaches online courses from the road \u2014 a future that wouldn't have been possible without GM's help in going to school, and that she wouldn't have embraced without GM shuttering the Lordstown plant.\"GM is hard to walk away from because the insurance benefits are awesome,\" Amato said. \"GM gave us a good life. Am I disappointed in what they're doing? For other people, yes. For me, no. If something like this didn't happen, I wouldn't be able to follow a dream.\" We don't want Elon Musk coming in. We don't want Amazon building a distribution center.\"Dave Green, UAW Local 1112 presidentFor the next generation, the question is what kind of wages the new working class jobs will pay. The local high school has started a training program for the logistics industry, helping prepare kids for jobs in the many distribution centers that are popping up in the area. \"That's our way of giving kids a little bit of a leg up,\" said Armstrong, superintendent of the Lordstown school district, where about 15% of students have parents who worked in the plant.But, he said: \"I don't see them paying what the GM jobs paid.\" TJ Maxx, for example, is building a facility that will employ 1,000 people in the area. Job listings for entry-level warehouse workers at its other locations range between $10 and $13.50 an hour.Terry Armstrong is the superintendent of the Lordstown school district, which has already been losing students as parents have moved out of town to keep their jobs with GM. The GM plant had also been a regular stop for politicians on the stump, from John McCain to Barack Obama, giving kids a sense that their town mattered. On Tuesday, the school held a group photo to support the Drive it Home campaign; students and staff alike wore blue and brought their GM cars.But after this latest blow, will Lordstown students have confidence in a future in manufacturing? \"It would be really hard to convince many of them of that right now, with the plant closing,\" Armstrong said. \"They're able to make the cars of the future, we just have to make that chance available.\"",

        "content": "Bedford, New HampshireRoger Brown still remembers the shocked looks people gave him the first time he rode a Segway through the halls of the company's New Hampshire headquarters.It was early 2013, a rough time for the startup and its aspirations of changing how the world gets around. Brown had bought the company for just $9 million a few weeks before and flown in from his home in Tennessee to begin turning things around. What better way to get a sense of the place than to zip about on its signature product?As Brown cruised the halls on the self-balancing two-wheeled scooter, an employee pulled him aside to lecture him on the risks of riding without a helmet. Brown was dumbfounded. \"I own the company,\" he told the employee. \"I can do it.\" With that, he whizzed away. A few hours later, he received an email outlining the company's safety policies, which included mandatory helmet use. Either Brown would change his ways, or he'd be written up. All these years later, he still finds it more than a bit silly. \"You would've thought I went to the Baptist convention and walked around with a pro-abortion sign,\" he said recently.Read MoreThe fuss over a helmet was the least of Brown's problems. He was the third person to own Segway, which had grabbed headlines in 2001 with the Segway PT and a promise to supplant the automobile and reinvent transportation. Instead, the company's flagship product became a punchline and the company a mess. In the years before Brown bought Segway, a half-dozen CEOs had come and gone, many of its best engineers had defected, and the VCs who had once showered Segway in cash had moved on to the next big thing.There was a significant dork factor. It was never truly socially accepted.Matt Gelbwaks, early Segway employeeBrown bought the company from the estate of Jimi Heselden, a British entrepreneur who died after riding his Segway off a cliff. Segway was barely getting by on the meager revenue it brought in selling the PT to tour companies, security companies and police departments. But Brown saw a global brand with a powerful distribution channel. Six million tourists rode Segways on tours of cities like San Francisco and Washington, DC each year. He planned to buy other transportation companies focused on short trips, like e-bike startups. All he had to do to make Segway profitable, he figured, was run the place well.Brown brought on new employees to change Segway's uptight culture. He led an effort to trim costs by reengineering a circuit board, ditching the PT's expensive gyroscope in favor of a cheaper solution, and negotiating a better battery contract. It worked. Segway turned a profit within a year of Brown's arrival. He sold the company to the Chinese firm Ninebot on April 1, 2015 for more than $75 million.For a time, he was happy. Then one day in August of this year, he got lunch at the Boathouse, a barbecue joint in Cincinnati. As he ate wings and pulled pork sliders, Brown noticed people riding scooters along the riverwalk outside, and not just any scooters: Segway scooters.     Ninebot introduced the Segway scooters shortly after Brown cashed out, triggering the scooter-sharing craze that has swept the world in the last year. You can find Ninebot's scooters in more than 100 cities, from the Americas to Asia, Europe and Australia. Ninebot can barely keep up. The company, which has more than 1,000 employees, will ship more than one million scooters this year \u2014 10 times the number of PTs Segway sold in its first 17 years. Silicon Valley-backed Bird and Lime, both of which launched in 2017, lead the trend. They're growing faster than the ridesharing leaders, Uber and Lyft, did in their early days. Uber and Lyft have responded by launching their own scooter services this fall. So has Ford. All rely on Ninebot scooters. \"If I would've had the vision of Bird or Lime,\" Brown said, \"Segway would have been worth $10 billion.\"Scooters are built at Ninebot's factory in China.When Brown owned the company, he focused on the Segway PT, which cost thousands of dollars. It had always been too expensive and ahead of its time. Now, though, the urban transportation revolution that Segway founder Dean Kamen and his truly gifted engineers dreamed of is unfolding, even if they aren't a part of it. Many are thrilled.\"We knew this was the way future transportation products would work,\" said former Segway lead engineer Doug Field, who has since worked at Apple and Tesla. \"Anyone standing on something that's powered by electricity and a computer is a Segway descendant.\" The next big thingKamen is a colorful character, even among techies. He dropped out of college. He flies about in his own helicopter. He owns an island off the coast of Connecticut, and has joked about founding his own nation.He's also one hell of an inventor. Kamen made his name developing medical devices, such as a portable insulin pump and heart stents. In the 1990s he built a self-balancing wheelchair so the disabled could be at eye level with anyone. Even as he worked on medical devices, Kamen pondered the future of urban transportation. He didn't see a place for automobiles in that future, and liked to say you don't need a 4,000-pound vehicle to move a 150-pound person one mile. After finishing the wheelchair, developing an entirely new mode of transportation was the obvious next step.Dean Kamen rides the Segway PT. (Photo by Mark Peterson/Corbis via Getty Images)Kamen met Field in the mid-1990s when Field was working at Johnson & Johnson, one of Kamen's business partners. Kamen found himself struck by Field's intelligence.Field, for his part, seemed destined to revolutionize transport. His mother wrote in his baby book that her son would one day work on stuff with wheels. Kamen's vision of moving people about on small, electric machines enticed Field, who had started his career developing vehicles at Ford. He found the challenge of developing self-balancing technology irresistible.At Segway, Field earned a reputation as a brilliant engineer and calm leader who listened to everyone, didn't micromanage, and was beloved by all. \"You got the impression he was searching for perfection among leadership, team-building,\" said Jason Sachs, an early Segway employee. \"His character and manner made people trust him.\"The world got its first glimpse of the Segway PT \u2014 Personal Transporter \u2014 on Good Morning America on December 3, 2001. It was, in a word, a sensation. Few products have enjoyed such hype. John Doerr, an early investor in Google and Amazon, predicted it would be bigger than the internet and that it would achieve $1 billion in revenue faster than any product in history. Hype aside, the PT was an impressive gadget. Gyroscopes allowed it to balance perfectly on two wheels. Instead of using handlebars or a steering wheel, riders shifted their weight to turn. It marked the first consumer application of drive-by-wire technology, in which software, not mechanical linkages, makes a machine turn, accelerate, and stop. Riders zipped along at up to 12.5 mph for as much as 12 miles on a single charge.A Segway tour passes through Hanover, Germany. (Photo by Swen Pf\u00f6rtner/picture alliance via Getty Images)The PT was truly innovative, even revolutionary. Kamen, who had spent parts of about six years developing the PT, spoke seriously of rendering cars obsolete. His employees talked about working with urban planners in China to design new cities around their two-wheeled transport.\"There was a lot of reference to drinking the Kool-Aid,\" said early Segway employee Matt Gelbwaks. \"We're here to change the world. It's bigger than us. It's bigger than us individually, it's even bigger than us collectively.\"Things didn't quite work out that way. Although brilliantly designed and meticulously built, two significant drawbacks hobbled the PT: It cost $4,950 and it was hard to look like anything other than a nerd riding one. It became a punchline, and then a trope, as a prop in television shows like \"Arrested Development\" and movies like \"Mall Cop.\" It didn't help that guys like Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak took to playing polo with them and that President George W. Bush fell off of one in 2003.Former president George W. Bush falls off a Segway; Actor Kevin James races NASCAR stock cars on a Segway to promote his 2009 movie, \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop;\" Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak plays Segway polo.That same year, Gelbwaks launched an experiment in Celebration, Florida, to see how people used the scooters. The company sold them at a deep discount to roughly 100 residents. Within a year nearly all of the participants had stopped riding their Segways. Why?\"There was a significant dork factor,\" Gelbwaks says. \"It was never truly socially accepted.\"Cash crunchThe experiment in Florida highlighted another problem: Segway developed and tested the PT under the greatest secrecy. The company worried a competitor might beat it to market, and suspected Japanese automakers were working on a similar device. Employees kept the shades drawn. In some cases, they sealed the blinds with tape, lest someone try to peek through the narrow gap between the blind and window frame. They hid the scooters in plywood crates before transporting them. But working this way kept Segway from figuring out what people might want or need in a scooter.\"How do you do product testing if you can't go outside?\" said Jonathan Pompa, an early Segway engineer. \"It worked really well at driving around an engineering office, because that's what we were doing with it, instead of driving around in a city.\"Kamen's singular focus on the PT created another problem: Although Segway built prototypes of electric bikes, four-wheelers, skateboards and even a unicycle \u2014 many of which Ninebot, its eventual owner, currently offers \u2014 it never commercialized them. It couldn't, because it didn't have the money.Segway struggled to bring the price of the PT down to a consumer-friendly $1,000. The cost of its nickel metal hydride battery made that impossible. Manufacturing in New Hampshire, rather than China, didn't help. Despite the company's best efforts, the PT remained frightfully expensive.\"Five or six grand for one of these things was crazy,\" said Klee Kleber, Segway's vice president of marketing from 2004-07. \"The price was way out of whack.\"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos stands on a Segway PT with Dean Kamen and NASDAQ Vice Chairman David Weild, center, after opening the NASDAQ on Nov. 18, 2002, the same day the device went on sale to the public. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) You won't get any argument from Jim Norrod, the company's CEO from 2005 until 2009.\"A lot of people said our products were too expensive, they were too high-priced. Yeah, they were,\" Norrod said. \"You know why? I needed the money to run the company.\"Beyond the exorbitant cost, the world was not ready for electric vehicles. Oh sure, there were plenty of wealthy techies for whom it was a fun toy, and Segway was able to experiment with rental programs and even to explore a partnership with Zipcar, the car-sharing outfit. But it lacked the infrastructure needed to truly transform transportation. Plus, buying one was a headache. The first customers had to travel to regional training centers for lessons. And once you bought one, there was no clear place to ride it. A lot of people didn't want them on sidewalks. Unlike the ride-hailing and scooter startups of today, the company spent years working within the system to win friends and change rules.\"Did we need to pass a law in Mississippi? Did we need to pass a law in North Dakota? No,\" said Matt Dailida, who led a nationwide push to make Segways on sidewalks legal. \"But it was a fundamental belief at the company's highest levels that we wanted to be engaging public officials and get their buy-in and excitement.\"Norrod was doing everything he could to rein in costs and keep Segway afloat when General Motors threw him a lifeline in 2007. The two companies started developing the EN-V, a pod-shaped lightweight electric vehicle concept that GM would unveil three years later at Expo 2010 in Shanghai.Just as things looked up, though, the financial crisis hit.\"I'm sitting there with no ability to bring money in,\" he said. \"Venture capitalists are basically cutting out their non-profitable businesses. The stock market craters. That's what I'm staring at and saying, 'what am I going to do?' I had to find any deal that was going to work.\" GM seemed like an obvious buyer. Together they could commercialize the EN-V and fulfill the long-delayed Segway vision of post-car urban transportation. GM's bankruptcy dashed those hopes. Instead, Norrod engineered a sale to Heselden, the British entrepreneur. When he died, Brown took over.When Segway met NinebotIn 2014, Segway convinced the US International Trade Commission to investigate infringements of Segway's patents for its self-balancing technology. One of the companies listed in Segway's complaint was Ninebot, which quickly offered to buy the company. Ninebot saw a company that shared its vision of improving urban transport. It also saw a company with tremendous brand recognition. And it knew it would need Segway's patents to enter the US market. The two sides quickly closed the deal, which was announced April 15, 2015.Ninebot began almost immediately to sell a series of Segway branded scooters and other products priced at $1,000 or less. They've sold far faster than the Segway PT ever did, and were exactly the kind of affordable options Kleber, the former VP of marketing, envisioned. \"Segway now is sort of where I thought we should've been 10 years ago,\" Kleber said.The golden age of electric transportationFifteen years after Kamen introduced the world to an electric vehicle, the world was finally ready for them. By 2017, the sharing and gig economies were in full swing, two things essential to the success of companies like Lime and Bird. People think nothing of sharing rather than owning things these days, and a ready supply of independent contractors makes charging and repairing scooters far easier \u2014 and cheaper. It also helped that smartphones, which make it a breeze to unlock a scooter and pay for a ride, are ubiquitous. And the ever-growing number of bike lanes in urban centers provides a place to ride safely.The business attitude has shifted, too. Segway's attempts at working with cities gave way to a more aggressive attitude of barging into a city with a few hundred scooters, setting up shop, and dealing with city officials later. The tactic rarely wins friends in government, but has allowed Bird and Lime to grow rapidly.\"At Segway we tried to do it the right way, and it was a nightmare,\" Kleber said. \"So I kind of actually respect the fact that they're just blowing in and dumping the scooters in the street and letting it sort itself out.\" Bird scooters rest on a sidewalk in San Diego. (Frank Duenzl/picture-alliance/dpa/AP Images)Scooter startups also follow the Silicon Valley ethos of iterate, iterate, iterate, which runs counter to Segway's perfectionism. The startups favor cheap scooters \u2014 they typically cost just a few hundred bucks \u2014 that were never designed for the rigors of heavy use and adverse weather. But why worry about such things when scooters are essentially commodities, easily replaced when they inevitably break or get thrown into trees, rivers, or San Francisco Bay? Bird, Lime, and all their competitors prefer to move fast, learn from mistakes, solicit customer feedback, and then introduce improvements like bigger batteries.Anyone standing on something that's powered by electricity and a computer is a Segway descendent.Doug Field, former Segway VP of design and engineeringThe success of these companies draws mixed emotions from Segway veterans, but the most common feeling among the 20 former employees who spoke to CNN Business was excitement. Lightweight electric vehicles, long ridiculed as an expensive toy for nerds, are finally getting their due.\"I love it,\" Pompa said. \"It's a transportation niche that hasn't been properly addressed.\"Yet some worry the current growth trajectory cannot continue, and that scooter startups run the risk of litigation and even financial ruin if they don't get serious about safety. People regularly ride without helmets (often in violation of local ordinances or state laws), zip through traffic or along sidewalks indiscriminately, and sometimes ride two-to-a-scooter. Two riders have died on the scooters this year.\"If you want to make this sustainable for a long time, significantly more thought should be put into this,\" said Stephan de Penasse, one of Segway's first employees. \"Everyone's in for a fast buck.\" Segway's delayed victorySegway's office in Bedford, New Hampshire, is a quiet place. It focuses on the Segway PT, and the market for it is shrinking, according to Ninebot. As a result, there were layoffs earlier this year. When CNN Business visited in September, an area once used for testing the Segway PT had given way to palettes of scooters fresh from China. Most of the R&D and manufacturing has moved to a bustling building outside Beijing. Still, employees feel a tremendous sense of pride in what they've accomplished.\"People like to say Segway was a flop, but we're still here,\" said Roxanne Lamonde, a 12-year-veteran of Segway and its director of risk management and human resources. \"There aren't many startups that started when we did and are still around.\"Many employees believe the popularity of scooters and success of companies like Lime and Bird vindicates Kamen's vision of personalized, electric transportation. \"If Segway was a piece of leading to that vision of getting around congested cities easier, I guess I'm pretty proud of that,\" former employee Chip MacDonald said. \"I just wish I could've been able to profit from it.\"As for Kamen, he believes the scooter boom confirms his ideas about the future of transportation. But he isn't terribly interested in talking about it, and wonders why the media would be. He considers the Segway a footnote to his career, something of far less import than the advances he pioneered in insulin pumps and dialysis machines, or the students he's encouraged, through his nonprofit FIRST, to pursue engineering.These days, Kamen is far more excited about his latest venture, the Advanced Regenerative Manufacturing Institute, which explores ways of regenerating human organs. He mentions this to me as he is driving home from a speech in Boston, where he'd gone to recruit employees (he's hired 60 engineers in the past two months alone). As usual, he was introduced to the audience as the inventor of the Segway.\"It's been 20 years,\" he said. \"No matter what else I do in life, I'm the Segway guy.\"People usually praise the Segway and Kamen's efforts to remake transportation. But occasionally someone will ask if Kamen considers it a failure. When that happens, he often thinks of the Wright Brothers.\"They certainly weren't giving out frequent flyer miles by 1920,\" he said. \"But I don't think anybody would say, 'Hey Wilbur hey Orville, how do you feel about that failure?'\"And in the emerging world of micromobility, a catch-all term for small, computerized electric vehicles, Kamen is a visionary with a place in history.\"A lot of people laughed at him when the Segway was released or failed,\" said Sanjay Dastoor, CEO of Skip, a scooter-sharing company. \"I always thought it was a shame for that to be people's first reaction. He had an amazing career, and really, Dean was right.\"",

        "content": "Molsheim, FranceInside the small glass building where some of the fastest cars in the world are made, there is never a sense of haste. There is also little noise. In a tunnel lined with blazing white lights, workers can look for tiny imperfections in the finished product. Elsewhere, they slide a 16-cylinder engine into its home just behind the driver's seat. Occasionally, they gather at a central table for a meeting. There is no assembly line here. It would make no sense to set one up. Only a few cars are being built here at any one time. At the Bugatti factory in Molsheim, France, a worker carefully inspects a Bugatti Chiron.This is the home of Bugatti in France's Alsace region. I'm standing inside a factory but Bugatti would never use that word. The company's executives always refer to it as \"the atelier,\" the workplace of an artist or an artisan. A little pretentious, maybe, but the word fits. Built in 2005 by Bugatti's corporate owner, Volkswagen Group, the Bugatti headquarters in the town of Molsheim stands on land that was Ettore Bugatti's in the early 1900s, when he was building some of the world's fastest, most expensive and most beautiful cars. Read MoreVolkswagen has gone to incredible lengths to recreate the essence of what Ettore Bugatti's small shop was doing in the first half of the twentieth century. Bringing Bugatti back from the brinkJust three decades ago, Bugatti was, for practical purposes, extinct. After Ettore Bugatti's death in 1947, the brand never fully recovered. There had been sporadic attempts at reviving it, including one that produced a few examples of a well-regarded supercar, the EB110, which was made in Italy. None of these attempts ultimately succeeded. By the time Volkswagen purchased Bugatti out of bankruptcy in 1998, there was little left of it but a name and a red oval logo. Volkswagen has revived the Bugatti brand, known for making some of the fastest, most beautiful cars in the world. But rebuilding brands is something Volkswagen has proven it can do particularly well. In the same year Volkswagen bought the Bugatti brand, it also bought the British ultra-luxury brand Bentley. Under the decades long ownership of Rolls-Royce, Bentley had been largely reduced to a badge placed on cars that were otherwise little different from Rolls-Royces. With the introduction of visually striking cars like the Continental GT, Volkswagen returned Bentley to its roots as a maker of luxurious but fast and sporting automobiles, clearly distinct in feel and image from those of its former owner. (The Rolls-Royce brand was purchased by BMW, which built a new factory and set about restoring that brand's image as well.)Bugatti was in far worse shape than Bentley, however. By the time Volkswagen came into the picture, Bugatti cars hadn't been made in Molsheim in about half a century. Bugatti was reborn with the Veyron in 2005. Now, Bugatti sells two new ultra-fast supercars, the Chiron and the recently unveiled Divo, both built at the facility in Molsheim, with price tags starting at $3 million and nearly $6 million, respectively. The land of Le PatronLocating production back in France's Alsace region was a strategic move on Volkswagen's part. First, it lends an air of authenticity to the Bugatti brand. Buyers now frequently visit the atelier to discuss their cars and see where they're made. Those customers walk the grounds trod by \"Le Patron,\" as Ettore Bugatti was called. Ettore Bugatti was an engineering genius, who had expensive tastes and loved horses. The son of a renowned Italian art nouveau furniture designer, Carlo Bugatti, Ettore Bugatti was a flamboyant engineering genius who became known for his fine tastes and his love of horses. The cars he created earned a reputation on the race tracks in Europe and the Americas as some of the fastest in the world. For those who weren't racing, Bugatti made fast cars covered in beautiful bodies designed by Ettore Bugatti's son, Jean Bugatti.Beyond history, there are other reasons for locating Bugatti production in Molsheim, executives say. There's a pool of skilled manufacturing workers to tap into and there is intense local pride in the town's most famous brand. Also, given the region's history \u2014 the border between France and Germany has moved back and forth across it several times in history -- many people speak German, the common language of the production floor.Ettore Bugatti was a fanatic about cleanliness and insisted that his workshop be spotless, as this modern one is. Antiseptically clean, the space looks like a cross between a semiconductor lab and a garage. Normally on a production line, time is very predictable. Time is at a premium. Here it is not.\" Christophe Piochon, head of production.Bugatti plans to produce a total of only 500 Chirons and just 40 Divos in a process that can take up to two months for each car.\"Normally on a production line, time is very predictable. Time is at a premium. Here it is not,\" said Christophe Piochon, Bugatti's head of production.The modern Bugatti facility is certainly much less self-contained today than it was in Ettore Bugatti's era. Now it is purely a \"final assembly\" location. Major components, such as the massive 16-cylinder engines and carbon fiber body sections, are made elsewhere and shipped here to be put together. Then the final results are painstakingly inspected and test driven on local country roads and at a nearby airfield.It can take up to two months to produce one Bugatti supercar.There is one other big difference. Volkswagen would actually like to make a sustained profit from the brand. \"I don't think Mr. Bugatti was a businessperson at all,\" said Kruta.In Ettore Bugatti's day, money came in from customers and money was spent on making cars, paying workers and on Bugatti's own lavish lifestyle. He apparently gave little thought to whether the sums coming in bore much relationship to the sums going out.After two decades under Volkswagen's ownership, Bugatti \u2014 selling about 70 cars a year \u2014 has recently become profitable.The spaceships of the auto worldThere are far easier ways to make money in the car business. But high-end cars like the Chiron are also justified by the prestige they reflect on their parent company as well the lofty challenges they present. The Chiron, which starts at $3 million, is among the fastest production cars ever made. These are the spaceships of the automotive world. Brands like Bugatti allow an automaker's most talented designers, engineers and executives to explore bold aspirations without leaving the company to do so, said Erich Joachimsthaler, a branding consultant and CEO of Vivaldi. The cars themselves stick close to Bugatti's formula. In the 1930s, cars like the Type 57 Atlantic were among the fastest and most luxurious of their day. They are still considered some the most beautiful ever made.Today the Chiron is the fastest production car in the world but is also easy to drive on normal roads, just like the Type 57 cars were. That's far more of a challenge today given the much higher speeds made possible by modern engineering. It's also hard to create a car that can safely go over 250 miles an hour, but that still looks beautiful when parked.\"Our philosophy is really to create beauty from engineering superlatives that we have on the car and think through that,\" said Achim Anscheidt, Bugatti's head of design. \"Technical development can be beautiful. If I think about, you know, the nose cone of the Concord, for example, or the Eiffel Tower or the Automium in Brussels.\"The design of today's Bugattis were inspired by cars like the Type 57 Atlantic.The large curves behind the Chiron's side windows, for instance, mimic the curves of a classic 1930s Bugatti. But they also frame enormous vents that draw in the huge volumes of air that feed the car's massive engine.One major difference between then and now is that, in his day, Ettore Bugatti cared little about what individual customers wanted. His notion was simply to build the best cars in the world and, if they really were the best, then customers would pay a lot for for them. Today, customers can select freely from literally limitless combinations of exterior paint colors and interior trims.\"We have to keep in mind that 30% of our customers are configuring their car not with the colors that we are offering but they're coming to us and saying 'I want the color of my wife's handbag for the interior and I want the color of my classic [Bugatti] Type 35 in the garage to be the exterior color,\" Anscheidt said.Le Patron never would have had the patience for that.",

        "content": "Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (CNN Business)One of China's biggest smartphone makers has never sold a handset in the country. Yet thousands of miles away, it dominates markets across Africa. Unknown in the West, Transsion has left global players like Samsung and Apple trailing in its wake in a continent that's home to more than a billion people.In cities like Lagos, Nairobi and Addis Ababa, busy streets are awash with the bright blue shopfronts of Transsion's flagship brand, Tecno. In China, the company doesn't have a single store, and its towering headquarters in the southern megacity of Shenzhen goes largely unnoticed among skyscrapers bearing the names of more famous Chinese tech firms.A Tecno sign in Addis Ababa. The brand is a common sight in African cities. The company took a different path to success from other top Chinese smartphone makers such as Huawei and Xiaomi, which started out in China before eventually expanding overseas. Transsion built its business in Africa. And it has no plans to come home.The perfect selfieRead MoreIn Edna Mall on the bustling Bole Road in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, Mesert Baru poses for her Tecno Camon i. \"This phone is seriously nice for selfies,\" says the 35-year-old shop assistant, admiring the picture she just took.  Mesert's satisfaction is no accident. Tecno cameras have been optimized for African complexions, explains Arif Chowdhury, vice president of Transsion. \"Our cameras adjust more light for darker skin, so the photograph is more beautiful,\" he says. \"That's one of the reasons we've become successful.\"A Tecno user in Ethiopia using her smartphone.Transsion founder George Zhu had spent nearly a decade traveling Africa as head of sales for another mobile phone company when he realized that selling Africans handsets made for developed markets was the wrong approach. His timing could hardly have been better. By the mid-2000s, the Chinese government, under its \"Going Out\" strategy, was encouraging entrepreneurs to look abroad and forge stronger ties with African nations in particular. Cell phones were spreading rapidly in China, but in Africa \u2014 which has a roughly similar population \u2014 they were still a very rare luxury.Africa, in other words, could be the new China.     Giving consumers what they wantIn 2006, Zhu launched Tecno in Nigeria, targeting Africa's most populous nation first. From the start, the company's motto was \"think global, act local,\" which meant making phones that met Africans' specific needs.\"When we started doing business in Africa, we noticed people had multiple SIM cards in their wallet,\" Chowdhury says. They would awkwardly swap the cards throughout the day to avoid the steep charges operators would levy for calling different networks, says Nabila Popal, who tracks the use of devices in Africa for research firm IDC. \"They can't afford two phones,\" says Chowdhury, \"so we brought a solution to them.\" Zhu made all Tecno handsets dual SIM.A Tecno store on Bole Road in Addis Ababa.More innovations followed. Transsion opened research and development centers in China, Nigeria and Kenya to work out how to better appeal to African users. Local languages such as Amharic, Hausa and Swahili were added to keyboards and phones were given a longer battery life.I can spend 24 hours constantly talking, browsing on this phone, no problem. With a Samsung, no way.Sewedo Nupowaku, CEO of Revolution MediaExtra juice was important. In Nigeria, South Africa and Ethiopia, for example, the government frequently shuts off electricity to conserve power, leaving people unable to charge their phones for hours. In less developed markets, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Chowdhury says, consumers might have to walk 30 kilometers to charge their phone at the local market -- and have to pay to do so. \"For those kind of consumers, longer battery life is a blessing,\" he adds.  Sewedo Nupowaku, the Lagos-based CEO of entertainment company Revolution Media, says he switched from a Samsung S3 to a Tecno L8 for this reason. \"I can spend 24 hours constantly talking, browsing on this phone, no problem. With a Samsung, no way.\"  But perhaps Transsion's smartest move was its pricing. It has three main brands: Tecno, Infinix and Itel. Most of their feature and smartphones sell for between $15 and $200.      Mesert says she bought her Tecno smartphone for 2,000 birr ($72). At a shop near her workplace, an iPhone 7 costs the equivalent of $906, and a Samsung Galaxy J7 around $360. Average monthly wages in Ethiopia range from 1,500 birr ($54) to 3,000 ($108) birr, and most vendors across Africa don't allow customers to pay in installments. \"About 95% of Transsion smartphones cost under $200,\" says Mo Jia, an analyst at technology research firm Canalys. \"They are the king of the budget smartphone.\"Tecno: 'We are African'Less than a decade ago, Chinese phones were barely on the radar in Africa. In 2010, Nokia and Samsung (SSNLF) dominated sales across the continent. By the first half of this year, Nokia's share of the market had collapsed and Samsung was selling only one in 10 phones. Transsion had come from nowhere to take more than 50% of the market, according to Canalys. For smartphones alone, it accounts for nearly a third of all sales in Africa, according to IDC.     Apple (AAPL) has been complacent about African markets, Jia says, because it deemed the slim profit margins on low-cost phones not worth fighting for. Transsion, on the other hand, is happy to work with tight margins, he adds. Apple didn't respond to requests for comment.Transsion's rise reflects the wider role Chinese firms now play in providing the technology people across Africa use to communicate, including the high-speed internet networks on which smartphones rely. Despite security concerns in countries such as the United States and Australia about Huawei and ZTE, Jia expects demand for Chinese products to remain strong in Africa, where governments and consumers are so price sensitive.Transsion's assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.In its marketing, Transsion plays down its Chinese roots. \"In Africa, we say that we are African,\" Chowdhury says, explaining why Tecno's stores carry no Chinese characters or signs of being a Chinese brand. In the 2017-2018 Brand Africa 100 report, published by African Business magazine, Tecno ranked as the 7th most admired brand in Africa. That was up from 14th the previous year, but it still lagged Samsung (2nd) and Apple (5th). The iPhone is still considered a luxury product that many Africans aspire to own.  I like that my phone is made in EthiopiaMesert Baru, owner of Tecno Camon i In Ethiopia, Transsion went a step further to assimilate. Since 2011, every phone it sells in Africa's second most populous nation has been assembled at its facilities in the suburbs of Addis Ababa. About 700 workers piece together Shenzhen-manufactured screens, circuit boards and batteries to churn out 2,000 smartphones and 4,000 feature phones a day.  Transsion says it has a total of 10,000 local employees in Africa, and 6,000 in China. Its low-cost African workforce helps it keep down prices, according to Jia. It also adds appeal for some consumers. \"I like that my phone is made in Ethiopia,\" Mesert says.A homegrown rival to SpotifyNigeria, with its population of 186 million, is Transsion's biggest market. It has connected with consumers there through one of their biggest passions: music.Oye Akideinde, an amateur rapper turned software developer, was recruited by Tecno in 2015 to launch a music app called Boomplay, a homegrown rival to iTunes or Spotify. Most Nigerian internet users grew up illegally downloading music or streaming it for free on YouTube, according to Akideinde, a 40-year-old Lagos resident. Tecno's vision was to attract music lovers by uniting African and international artists on a single platform offering affordable downloads and streaming with advertising. It preloaded the app onto every Tecno smartphone and made it the default music player. The app now has 32 million users.Transsion is the parent company behind the popular brands Tecno, Infinix and Itel.Tecno spun off Boomplay and its apps division into a new company, TranssNet, last year. Backed by NetEase, a $30 billion Chinese internet company, TranssNet plans to introduce a suite of financial apps on smartphones made by Transsion.  Chinese companies have been eager to use technology to tap into Africans' spending habits. In 2015, Kenyan mobile payments operator M-Pesa migrated all of its 12.8 million subscribers to Huawei's Mobile Money platform as it expanded across East Africa and beyond. The move increased the number of transactions M-Pesa could process, and the app's user base has more than doubled since then. Expanding in India and beyondFor Transsion, future growth is set to come from building its business outside Africa in other developing markets, such as Russia, Indonesia and Bangladesh. In 2017, it launched Tecno in India and within a year had claimed 5% of the huge market, according to IDC.How did Tecno make such rapid progress? Transsion's Chowdhury says another innovation tailored to local customs has helped. \"Indian people use their hands to eat food,\" he says, \"so their fingers get oily. What if you're having lunch and your boss calls? You try to take the call but your fingerprint won't work.\" The fix: screens that can read greasy fingers.",

        "content": "It's been one year since Covid-19 was declared a pandemic and businesses started closing. CNN Business looks back on the pandemic's impact on the global workforce and how things may have forever changed.In March 2020, companies across the US abruptly shuttered their offices and instructed employees to work from home indefinitely as a result of the pandemic. At first, many thought the shutdowns would last a couple months. But one year later, millions of workers are still working remotely.The pandemic has forced a large segment of the global workforce to go through a remote-work experiment on a scale never seen before -- and a lot has changed in the last 12 months.The boundary between our work and our personal lives has become blurred. Working at the kitchen table has become common and, for parents, juggling virtual school while trying to hit work deadlines has become a daily challenge.Seth and Nicole Kroll work while their son Louis, 5, entertains himself at their home outside of Boston. Employers have also been forced to become more nimble. They've had to loosen restrictions on where employees can work, equip them with the tools do so and support them both professionally and personally.Read MoreWe've learned many lessons as a result: meetings aren't always necessary, working a standard eight-hour shift may not be the best schedule for everyone, sitting at a desk doesn't always mean you're being productive and perhaps, you miss your coworkers more than you thought you would. Now that more people are getting vaccinated and kids are going back to school, things appear as if they might get back to \"normal,\" but the workplace as we knew it may be forever changed.Some companies plan to remain 100% remote post-pandemic, while others -- including companies like Reddit and Microsoft -- will take a hybrid approach, giving workers more flexibility about where they work. A social distancing marker is displayed in front of a reception desk at the JLL office in Chicago.And, of course, some companies will want everyone to come back. No matter what the approach, workers and employers can expect to hit a few bumps in the road as they navigate the next phase of this grand work experiment.\"Many companies succeeded working remotely in 2020 largely because everyone was doing it -- there was no built-in preference for office workers or stigma against remote workers,\" said Andrew Hewitt, senior analyst at market research firm Forrester. \"Hybrid is going to make managing this difference harder.\"The initial shock  The World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020. In a matter of days, companies across the globe were shutting their offices and many had little to no time to prepare their employees for getting work done entirely outside of office walls. At business review site Yelp, the IT department had to scramble to find nearly 3,000 laptops for workers, primarily sales employees, when it went remote in March. \"We always had spare laptops, but not 3,000,\" said Chief People Officer Carolyn Patterson. A Yelp employee's work-from-home setup, including their canine \"office mate.\"Artificial intelligence software company, Coveo, emptied its offices in early March 2020. With more than 600 workers across the globe, employees were used to working in different time zones and locations. Still, in-person collaboration and gatherings are an important part of the company's culture. \"We were a company that had a habit of getting together; literally flying people all over the world... to get together. People need to interact in person,\" said CEO Louis Tetu.What's your remote work situation like, one year later? Share your storyFrom the start, the company focused on making sure workers were well-equipped at their home office by allowing things like tech equipment and noise-canceling headphones to be expensed, as well as offering subsidies for high-speed internet. And it didn't come cheap.\"That meant we were going to give you the best chair, best screen ... that cost us into seven figures overnight,\" said Tetu.The cost, he said, was well worth it. \"You cannot build a great company if your people aren't well.\"But it wasn't just figuring out the logistics of how to work from home that challenged employers and their workers at the start of pandemic. There was the mental and emotional toll it took as well.It became very natural for us to have meetings where we had medical, mental health practitioners and discussions about business strategy all in the same meeting.\"Cisco chief people, policy and purpose officer Fran Katsoudas.\"We recognized that our employees were coming to us for guidance for everything: the pandemic, how they lived, wanting to know what was safe and what wasn't safe,\" said Cisco's executive vice president and chief people, policy and purpose officer Fran Katsoudas. \"It became very natural for us to have meetings where we had medical and mental health practitioners and discussions about business strategy, all in the same meeting.\"How Google, Microsoft and others plan to work post-pandemicTo help employees cope with the changes and uncertainties of the pandemic, some companies enhanced their benefits, offering things like free counseling, stipends for childcare and office set-ups and increased days off. But when it comes to the workforce post-pandemic, remote work will no longer be considered a special perk.\"It's no longer: 'Do you offer remote work?' But, do you offer it with enough organizational support so I can be as successful as the people who work in the office?\" said Hewitt.He expects about 60% of companies will offer a hybrid work model, while 30% of companies will be back in the office and 10% will be fully remote.Now here comes the hard partDespite the challenges, Hewitt says the past year has been easy compared to what will come next. \"We've been playing remote work on easy mode. We've all been doing the same thing, everybody has had equal access to information and promotions,\" said Hewitt. \"It will get harder in 2021 with hybrid.\"Covid-19 has turned New York's famous business districts into ghost towns. Inequality between remote and in-office workers can become an issue among hybrid workforces. People in the office get more face time with the boss, which can lead to better relationships, increased access to information and top assignments.\"There was the stigma [before the pandemic], that remote workers were less productive and career focused,\" Hewitt said. And companies have grappled with allowing remote workers in the past. In 2013, Marissa Mayer, then-CEO of Yahoo, sparked controversy when she ended the company's work-from-home option citing the need for better communication and collaboration among staff. IBM called back some of its remote workers in 2017.We've been playing remote work on easy mode...It will get harder in 2021 with hybrid\"Andrew Hewitt, senior analyst, ForresterTraining managers on how to equally incorporate remote and in-person workers in meetings and decision making, as well as how they communicate is a critical step in equalizing workforces. At Yelp, the majority of employees worked in the company's offices before the pandemic. The company is now giving most employees a choice to continue working remotely or come into the office a few days a week.\"We're going to be very cautious that managers don't shift into patterns that you have to come into the office for an important meeting, since that's not possible if people move away,\" said Patterson. Workers who move to areas with significantly higher or lower cost of labor could see their pay adjusted. The company created a three-tiered system to handle compensation changes for workers that relocate. \"If you are moving from a tier one location to a tier three, you will experience a reduced salary, but we still want to be competitive,\" said Patterson.Coveo also plans to give employees flexibility to choose where they work, but it has no plans to mandate that everyone be 100% remote. \"It's very dehumanizing,\" Tetu said of companies going fully remote and getting rid of offices. \"I think Slack and Zoom are great, but there is no equivalent of getting people together and fostering a common culture.\"He's looking forward to the day he can get his team together safely.\"We are going to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on plane tickets to bring everyone together. There is no question. There are massive gains and benefits in terms of cohesion.\" Permanent WFH sounds great. But it's harder than it soundsAs things start to return to normal and services like daycare reopen regularly, employers will likely become more strict with their remote working requirements, according to Hewitt. That could mean requiring the employee have childcare in place during working hours or standardizing a time zone that everyone works in.\"The other thing that does come up with 'anywhere work'  is tax laws,\" said Hewitt. \"That can get tricky and complex.\" Should an employee move to an area where a company doesn't already have employees or an office, it could bring administrative and tax burdens to the employer. Relocating could also affect workers' tax bills if they work in one state but live in another. The shrinking office Companies will also likely need less office space as more employees start working remotely. Tetu expects his company to use about 70% of the square footage that it did pre-pandemic. To meet the needs of a hybrid workforce, office designs are likely going to look different as well. There is a psychological impact of this that is lasting. Life has been shaken quite a bit, and there are multiple ramifications of this.\"Coveo CEO Louis TetuNot every worker will need a designated desk. Collaborative spaces will likely become a bigger priority so that more team-focused work can happen in the office, while individual work will be done at home. Some companies plan to use hot desking solutions, according to Hewitt, that allow workers to reserve a desk for when they're in the office. In an interview for CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction podcast, he said that some of Forrester's clients are looking to reduce 30% to 50% of their overall office space.A work station closed for social distancing at Catapult's offices in Boston. Yelp is also considering downsizing its office space, according to Patterson.\"As our leases come up, we will start reducing our footprint,\" she said, adding that Yelp's office spaces could be redesigned to include fewer desks and focus more on collaboration.Even as more people become vaccinated, experts warn that it's going to take time to return to any sense of normalcy at work. \"There is going to be a long tail here, there is no question about that,\" said Tetu. \"There is a psychological impact of this that is lasting. Life has been shaken quite a bit, and there are multiple ramifications of this.\"",

        "content": "We can all use a little help when it comes to being more productive, especially these days.Whether we're working from home or still going into the workplace, many of us have struggled to stay as productive as we were before the pandemic. Google said last month that its employees won't be returning to the office until September. That means the company will have to make a concerted effort to keep its workforce motivated and effective. CNN Business spoke with Google's executive productivity advisor Laura Mae Martin about how employees can stay focused and be more efficient when working from home. Here's what she had to say:(Editor's note: This interview has been edited for clarity and length. This conversation took place before Google employees announced they had formed a union. Google's director of people operations said the company supports the employees protected labor rights. \"But as we've always done, we'll continue engaging directly with all our employees.\" But Google and Martin didn't offer any further comment on that news.) Read MoreHow has your role evolved since the shutdowns began in March? Productivity was always a focus at Google and I think when [the pandemic] happened, it just kind of shifted what that means, what that looks like. People are so used to being productive at work, but how does that look at home? Right away I developed my top tips for working from home and how to have that same sort of stride that you hit in the office: Pick a work spot. There are scientific principles that show that when you are sitting in the same spot and you have the sights, smells and sounds of a location, your brain constantly goes back to what you were thinking about in that spot. So even if you don't have a home office, even choosing the same chair in your kitchen over and over will start to help your brain to get in that place. Similarly, you want to pick spots where you never work. If you never take your computer into your bedroom, you'll start being able to relax more in your bedroom because you've created that boundary.Which 'race' are you running? There are two groups of people from what I've seen. You have the person who is like: 'Wow... I am kind of in a place where I have more time than I ever have. I am just working all day from home.' That person I call a marathon runner. They have this long extended day -- they really need to think about burnout, about structure, about pacing themselves. Then you have the sprinters, which I am one of those. I have young kids, they are home from school. I am working in little spurts. I have less time than I've ever had. You want to think about how your race is going to be affected by working from home. How you can be more productive and what races the people on your team are running. If you are a marathoner you might be able to have a meeting at any time of the day. But your teammate might be sprinting so it might be better to ask them when is the best time to meet.Plan ahead. I have a daily plan I make for each day the night before. It makes you so much more accountable if you have an hour-by-hour schedule because it eliminates that 'I am sitting down, what should I work on, what should I do?' It is a contract to yourself. Embrace the ebbs and flows. We all have these natural circadian rhythms. They drive our sleep, whether we are a night owl or an early morning person, when we have energy -- and that goes into productivity, too. Everyone has these peak bursts of productivity -- and they're not the same. This is kind of a chance to ask yourself: Am I the kind of person that, without a commute, can wake up and do some email and I enjoy a mid-morning workout? Or would I like to take a break in the afternoon and go for a walk, where that might not be feasible in the office? Figure out what your ebbs and flows are and that is something you even apply when you go back to the office. What would you tell people who are overwhelmed with their email? First, I tell people to get anything out of their inbox they don't need to see. Even if you don't open an email, seeing an email uses a little piece of your energy. So if you are on aliases that you don't need to be on, anything from a past job, any newsletter you don't need to see, take time to create a couple rules or filters and get those out of there. One nice way is searching for the word \"unsubscribe\" because that is usually an indicator it's not sent directly to you.Two, anything you do need to see and needs to be important -- like emails directly from your manager to you -- have those show in a certain way. Have the [email] pop up with a star, flags, anything you want. Maybe your boss emails the whole org, that should look different than your boss emailing you.The final step...is to think about your laundry. Think of your dryer as your inbox: put your emails into piles, saying this is something I need to do later or I need to fold. This is something I am waiting on a response from or something I need to hang. Put everything in piles, and then do the basic definition of batch-tasking -- you fold, fold, fold or you respond, respond, respond in a certain time and you put them all away at once. That is how I think of inbox zero. It's dryer zero. It's not, 'I've addressed every single thing and I am done' because that is unrealistic. But it means I've sorted everything and I know what I need to do, and I have it in piles so that my future self can do it quickly. How can a person know if they are actually being productive versus just working all the time?  There is this misstep that the more hours you work the more productive you are. I think productivity is a little different than efficiency or output. You want to think: Did I set intentions, did I complete them and did I do them well? So all those things are important. What it comes down to is the planning piece. In that daily plan I actually have a box at the top that says \"tomorrow will be successful if...\" What is that? There is always going to be more, always going to be new things, but you're really thinking about: What are my plans, what can wait and what am I accomplishing? It's more about defining what your goals are to know if you hit them. What mistakes do people make when they think they are being productive?The number of hours you work does not always equate to the output. A lot of times it is a negative effect if you are working way too many hours. People are having so many more meetings because they are not getting those touch points at work. But you also want to think about being in meetings constantly all day -- is that really the goal for your job? People think of downtime or white space or think time as unproductive time, whereas really it's like pour-over coffee where the longer you let these ideas and conversations soak in, it's going to be much, much richer. And so having breaks, having downtime, having days off, all those things actually propel you forward.Laura Mae Martin is Google's executive productivity advisor. Do you think companies will be more flexible with how we work and scheduling?  There are some companies that have had that mindset where your ultimate goal is your output each quarter or whatever it is you are being measured on. But I think more traditional companies may have a 9-to-5 mindset. This kind of shows the difference of what are you really accomplishing by having people just sit in their seats for that amount of time versus what do you want them to actually get done? And that is what we are measuring now since we don't know when people are putting butts in seats at certain times, so I certainly think that shift will happen, it probably already has for companies that were originally having clock-in, clock-out. I am the kind of person who works really well before 9, but after 3 I need a little bit of a break, so if I was required to be in my seat from 9 to 5, I wouldn't be as effective an employee. I hope people are figuring out for themselves what are those ebbs and flows so that when we go back into the office they can start to tailor their schedule more toward that. For working parents and caregivers, what is the best approach to avoid feeling overwhelmed?For me, it's thinking about the time that I do have, and how do I make the absolute most of it? So if you know that your kids are doing virtual school, and you have two hours, maybe that's all you have in a day, you should be so buttoned-up on those two hours: preparing everything you need to get things done, setting yourself up, there is no sitting at the computer getting lost in your email thinking 'Ugh I have so much to do, I only have two hours.' So taking that time and making the absolute most of it. Doing too many things at once I think is really pulling yourself in multiple directions. So the same way we would prioritize for a brand new project, that is how you need to prioritize this. Maybe you aren't doing everything you were before, maybe you are getting more help from others than you were before, figuring how you can fit that in in a way that still makes you feel like you can be a good parent, a good worker -- all of those things versus stretched thin trying to do it all at one time.",

The housing madness shows no signs of slowing\"As soon as I'm...fully vaccinated I am going back to the office,\" said Longa, who does administrative IT as a long-term temp for a medical supply company.She and her husband have been working from their 550-square-foot apartment in Florida since last spring. And because they both work with sensitive information, they can't be in the same room, so she works from their bed while he's on the loveseat in their living room. \"I am probably going to have permanent back and shoulder problems for the rest of my life because of this past year,\" she said.Remote work during the pandemic has been a boon for some workers, giving them more time with family, more freedom and flexibility over their schedules, plus the comforts of home. And many companies have pledged to allow employees to work fully or partially remote even after the pandemic ends. Read More'I don't have to choose between lifestyle and career.' How remote work changed these people's livesBut for some, remote work has also been burdensome, with distractions from kids, partners and roommates, makeshift work spaces and little to no divide between work and home life.\"There is a group that wants to go into the workplace,\" said Brian Kropp, chief of research for the Gartner Human Resources Practice. \"They don't have a place to work, or they have roommates -- they don't have the physical setup and infrastructure to work from home.\"Longa barely leaves the bedroom during the day, usually only for bathroom breaks. And if her husband works late, she has to stay in the room or leave the apartment. Springs in the mattress she sits on are damaged from her long days, and the side of the loveseat where her husband sits to work is worn out. She's also worried she's going to have to replace their personal laptop, which she's been using for work. \"It's literally on all the time from 7:30 in the morning until I go to bed. And I use my keyboard all day now, which I didn't used to do.\"One benefit is that Longa doesn't miss her nearly 45-minute commute to and from work each day, and can now go a few months without having to fill her car up with gas.But the commute can act as a break between work and home life, and without it, work-life balance has been elusive for many remote workers. \"I am really keen to get back to the office,\" said Sarah Williams, associate director of the Business School, University of Wolverhampton, UK, who's been working from home for more than a year. \"For me, that blurring of the lines between home and work has been tough because I've felt like I am living at work rather than working at home.\" Since working remotely, her days tend to be dominated by back-to-back meetings, which don't leave a lot of time to step away from her home office.Sarah Williams, associate director of the Business School, University of Wolverhampton, UK, has been working from home for more than a year and misses the buzz of being on campus.\"So you aren't actually getting a chance to process anything or start to work on anything until after the working day, because the working day is spent in meetings,\" she said. \"The productivity happens after that. When you are writing reports or actually actioning the items that are given to you in the meeting, you are doing that after 6:00 pm.\" Being in the office also has professional advantages -- especially for new employees. \"People who are starting new jobs, it's very difficult in a remote work environment,\" said Erica Volini, Deloitte's Global Human Capital leader. \"They want to get to know the organization, understand the culture. They feel like those connections with their peers and manager can help them to move up within the organization and without that it sort of feels like 'Am I moving forward?'\"Working from home can also be isolating.\"The big issue for most employees is the social part of it -- getting coffee with a friend is fun, happy hours, and talking about what you did over the weekend -- all that stuff matters,\" Kropp said.It's been a year. Here's what your home office should look likeSocial connections are harder to forge when working remotely. And while technology has made collaboration easier, it doesn't always make up for in-person interaction. \"What is missing are those informal conversations that just spark when you are at the water cooler together. Those ideas when you are passing in the hallway and you say, 'oh I meant to talk to you about that' -- that is very difficult to get done in a remote work environment,\" said Volini. \"That is a big part of how organizations build new ideas, communities and relationships.\" Williams said she misses the buzz of being on campus. \"I am missing the corridor conversations, the quick coffees in the coffee shop that spark ideas ... you simply can't recreate those chance encounters when you are working from home.\"When she's able to return, Williams is hoping to spend the majority of her days working from her office on campus, and one or two days a week at home. Companies that make the decision to go all virtual could lose employees, but the same can be said for companies who require everyone back in the office.\"Employees are signing up for a certain culture and a certain experience. But it's going to work both ways. I think there will be some employees who really gravitate toward a company that makes a remote-first option available,\" said Volini.",

Begum's energy bills for her one-bedroom apartment have shot up by about \u00a370 ($92) in the past three months, even though she's using similar amounts of fuel. She works at Tesco (TSCDF), a supermarket chain, where she has seen \"every single product\" rise in price.\"Milk was 80p ($1.05). The smallest one, that's gone to \u00a31 ($1.31),\" she said. \"The bread \u2014 the cheapest bread that we used to do for \u00a31 \u2014 has gone to \u00a31.20 ($1.57).\" Annual consumer price inflation hit 5.5% in January in the United Kingdom \u2014 its highest level since 1992 \u2014 fueled by product shortages and a sharp spike in demand as pandemic lockdowns were lifted. Wages aren't keeping pace.  Read MoreAverage worker pay suffered its biggest drop in more than seven years in the three months to January, falling by 1% over the same period a year ago once inflation is taken into account, the UK Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday. And the war in Ukraine has driven energy costs even higher \u2014  gasoline and diesel prices have soared to new record highs in recent days.The Boiler House has multiple sites, including the Northwold Youth & Community Hub in east London.The Boiler House Youth and Community Space started its food pantry during the coronavirus pandemic. Unlike a traditional food bank, guests browse and shop for their own items, paying a \u00a36.50 ($8.50) fee to receive about \u00a335 ($46) worth of food and toiletries. But the charity's services have expanded to provide members with shoes and help paying their energy bills as many struggle with  the most severe knock to their purchasing power in years. Davina Mathurin, project officer for The Boiler House, summarized the dilemma many are facing. \"Do you either keep the house warm so [your] children don't get ill?\" she said. \"Or do [you] buy food so they can eat and they're not hungry?\"Millions of people's fuel bills rose in October when Britain's energy regulator increased its consumer price cap \u2014 the maximum suppliers can charge per unit of energy \u2014 by 12% after a global natural gas supply crunch pushed wholesale prices up to record levels.A shopper carries his purchases in Walthamstow, east London, on February 13.On the day CNN Business visited in February, Mathurin had started referring some members to fuel voucher programs organized by charities that offer up to \u00a349 ($64) to help with bills. Demand was high, she said.  Monique John, another regular visitor to the Boiler House, told CNN Business that she owns a smart meter. The device helps her conserve energy, but her money does not stretch nearly as far as it used to.  \"You just literally watch [the meter] go down and down and down and down and down,\" she said. 'There's just nothing left to give'The worst is yet to come.In April, the energy price cap will soar by 54% \u2014 its largest ever rise \u2014 burdening 22 million people with an annual bill of roughly \u00a32,000 ($2,618). Inflation is also expected to peak above 7% and a new payroll tax to help fund health and social care will take effect. Steam and smoke is seen rising from the chimneys and central heating vents of houses in January in London.The higher costs could push the number of \"destitute\" households \u2014 defined as those unable to afford basic necessities \u2014 up by a third to hit 1 million, according to analysis by The National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month pushed wholesale gas prices up even further as global markets panicked over whether sanctions would hit Russian exports. Analysts at investment bank Investec said Britons' annual energy bills after October \u2014 the next time the price cap is adjusted \u2014 could rocket past \u00a33,000 ($3,927) as a result. \"Now there's just nothing left to give from people's budgets. There's no way the numbers add up now,\" Lucy Bannister, policy campaigns manager at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, an anti-poverty charity, told CNN Business.\"Children are feeling too scared to ask for the heating to be put on,\" she added. \"They're really kind of taking on that stress that they're seeing their parents go through. Feeling hungry and not asking for a snack.\"The government will try to ease the pain by cutting local taxes and allowing millions of Britons to spread the cost of their energy bills over the next few years. A government spokesperson told CNN Business that it was \"providing support worth around \u00a312 billion ($16 billion) this financial year and next, to help households with the cost of living.\"The spokesperson added that the government would raise the minimum wage by more than \u00a31,000 ($1,309) a year and hike a benefit claimed by people on low incomes by the same amount. Both will start in April.Critics say the government's response is inadequate and fails to target those who need it most. Ian Allinson, a member of the executive committee at Manchester Trades Union Council, which organized a protest against higher costs in February, said the situation is \"alarming.\" He said the government's plan to delay energy payments won't help vulnerable people.\"We're appalled when the main measure the government has announced [to bring down energy bills] is that we have to give ourselves a loan,\" he told CNN Business. \"A lot of people are struggling with debt already. The idea that there's then enforced further debt rather than any genuine help is just shocking.\"People march through  Manchester on February 12, as protests were held nationally against rising energy bills and the cost of living.Angry Britons are taking to the streets. Protesters, and the opposition Labour Party, have called for a windfall tax on energy companies like BP (BP) and Shell (RDSA), which made billions in profit last year. \"It's just scandalous that the government is choosing to not do something effective to support ordinary people but is happy to leave those mega profits for the companies that are inflicting this on us,\" Allinson said. Paychecks can't keep upAt a north London church, piles of groceries are laid out in a grid on the floor of a small side building. Volunteers are packing the donated items into bags before driving them to people's doors. Cooking Champions, an organization which caters for charitable groups and local businesses, started its delivery service in April 2020 after the pandemic hit. Annalisa Moseley is one of the first to receive her shopping. The mother-of-two said that without Cooking Champions, some weeks she would have no food. Thinking about what will happen after April is stressful, she said.   Volunteers at Cooking Champions in London create food parcels using donated and redistributed food.\"It's all on my shoulders sort of thing to make sure the kids are warm and fed and everything,\" Moseley said. \"It has been getting me down a little bit, but just got to carry on. Keep trying.\"Moseley receives Universal Credit \u2014 a benefit for people who are out of work or on low incomes. The government hiked payments by \u00a320 ($26) a week during the pandemic, but that ended in October 2021. The benefit will increase by 3.1% in April, but that's less than half the expected rate of inflation.Rising wages can't keep up either. The Spring Community Hub, a food and clothes bank 15 miles to the south across London, runs another door-to-door delivery service. Lately, volunteers have helped increasing numbers of younger and more affluent people. \"We're seeing more working people and people on those precarious hours particularly,\" CEO Felicia Boshorin told CNN Business. \"When the actual money comes, it's not enough,\" she added.Parents are 'dreading' SeptemberSeptember looms large for parents worried about the cost of school uniforms. Shirts, sweaters and jackets emblazoned with school logos \u2014 mandatory in the United Kingdom \u2014 can run into the hundreds of pounds for a single child.One in 10 British families have fallen into debt buying items needed for school, according to a 2020 survey by The Children's Society, a charity. That figure could grow in 2022 \u2014 clothes and footwear were the biggest contributors to inflation in the month to January, according to the Office for National Statistics. Caroline Rice, who lives in Northern Ireland, is \"dreading\" the new school year. She is a member of Covid Realities, a research project documenting the experiences of low income families during the pandemic. \"I can't afford \u00a3100 ($131) for oil, so why would I pay \u00a350 ($65), \u00a360 ($79) for a school blazer?\" she said.Back at The Boiler House, parents are turning up with their children to browse shelves of colorful sneakers, donations provided by charity Sal's Shoes. Begum's daughter rushes over to a pair of white and pink sparkly Converse and tries them on. \"With poverty there is that loss of dignity if you're just effectively being handed handouts,\" said CJ Bowry, the founder of Sal's Shoes.Sal's Shoes' St Paul's Centre in Crewe, on February 16.Its three pop-up stores around the country aim to give \"families a shopping experience,\" she said. \"So they can visit these shops and try on shoes and choose shoes and see a selection of shoes \u2014 but they don't have to pay.\"Sal's Shoes has sent nearly 3 million pairs to 54 countries in its eight years, though more and more are being sent closer to home. The charity distributed 48,000 pairs around the United Kingdom in 2021, its highest number ever. Bowry said she receives calls every day from school principals asking for support.\"We have headteachers who've done playground duty and then ring us because they've literally noticed children in their playground with the soles flapping off their shoes,\" she said. 'Hardship is harder'The Bank of England expects inflation to cool after peaking in April, but high prices will stick around. For people who have taken on new debts and fallen behind on their bills, there will be a scarring effect that could last for years. Research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation last year found that 4.4 million low income households began borrowing or added to existing debts during the pandemic. Of that number, more than two thirds are behind on their repayments. Joseph De-Ville, another member of Covid Realities, lives in Cornwall with his wife and three children. He got into debt a couple of years ago to pay for his mother's funeral, and told CNN Business about the constant struggle to provide for his family.  \"This is the parts of life that people aren't seeing,\" he said. \"We're locking it up into credit cards so we can cope, and then we're struggling to pay the debts because [of] the interest rates \u2014 because we're having to take high interest rate credit cards just so we can get by.\" For over a decade, real incomes and living standards for millions of Britons have dropped. For De-Ville, the rising cost of living is just the latest chapter of an extended crisis.\"Hardship is harder,\" he said.",

        "content": "(CNN)The sprawling billion-dollar palace that sits on a hilltop overlooking the Black Sea is seen by some Kremlin critics as the ultimate emblem of Russian President Vladimir Putin's legacy of corruption.Dubbed \"Putin's Palace,\" the 190,000 square-foot mega-mansion was purportedly built for his personal use with funds from billionaire oligarchs, whom he allegedly allowed to flourish in Russia's notoriously corrupt economy so long as they shared the wealth -- with him.The property has its own amphitheater, underground hockey rink and private seaport, according to a documentary produced by jailed Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny's anti-corruption group. There is a no-fly zone in the skies above and a no-boating zone in the surrounding waters. The magnificent fortress stands in stark contrast to the tiny 800-square-foot apartment Putin claims in his official 2020 financial disclosure. Yet, despite the opulence of the hilltop retreat, \"I would be very surprised if Putin ever sets foot in there again,\" Nate Sibley, an expert on Russian corruption who advises members of Congress, told CNN. Read MoreSibley said the palace symbolizes what he sees as a bygone era of Putin pursuing, through the wealth of oligarchs, a luxurious lifestyle that he could never afford on his government salary. While Putin is believed to have amassed a hidden fortune by such means earlier in his career, Sibley said, he has since become less reliant on his wealthy benefactors over the years and has surrounded himself instead with government and military loyalists who share his hardline nationalist views. The sprawling palace and property on the coast of the Black Sea are seen in this image from a video by Alexey Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation.That shift, some Russia experts told CNN, may make it more difficult to make Putin personally feel the sting of economic sanctions the US and its European allies have imposed to punish him for invading Ukraine.Putin has positioned himself, as Sibley put it, \"above the fray.\" It wasn't always that way. Nearly two decades before Putin drew international ire for his most recent unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin had Russia's richest man plucked off his private jet and charged him with crimes against the state. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, an oligarch worth an estimated $15 billion at the time, sat caged in the middle of the courtroom during his highly publicized trial. Khodorkovsky, who had been critical of government corruption under Putin's leadership, was convicted of tax evasion and fraud, though he argued the charges were politically motivated. Putin pardoned him in 2013 and he has since lived in exile.Biden is vowing to seize Russian oligarchs' yachts. Here's where they are right now Putin's bold move against the billionaire oil magnate was seen as a message to other oligarchs: You might be next.The tactic demanded the unwavering loyalty of the oligarch class. The ensuing influx of cash, gifts and goodwill is one explanation for how Putin, who claims a salary of just $140,000 a year, is suspected of being one of the richest people on the planet. He is rumored to own or have access to not only the Black Sea palace, but also a $100 million yacht, according to published reports. CNN was unable to verify Putin's connection to the palace or yacht. The Kremlin has dismissed reports of Putin's purported hidden wealth.That the properties and other possessions aren't in his name doesn't matter, said Tom Burgis, author of a book on international money laundering called \"Kleptopia.\" Burgis likened Putin to The Godfather and said it's understood that when he asks an oligarch for something, it's not really a request.Mikhail Khodorkovsky, left, and his close associate, Platon Lebedev, seen in a defendant's cage at a courtroom in Moscow on July 12, 2004.\"Ultimately they owe everything they have to the boss. And with the click of a finger, as he has shown in the past, Putin can take everything,\" Burgis said. \"However influential they may seem, they are ultimately dependent on him.\"Several of Putin's closest associates -- including childhood friends, a woman who was reportedly his former lover, and a professional cellist who is the godfather of one of his daughters, have secretly amassed huge fortunes outside Russia during his time in power, according to leaked financial documents. A complicated web of shell companies, offshore banks and hidden transactions obscures their wealth, with accounts spirited away inside one another like Russian nesting dolls. But a series of leaks in recent years from firms that facilitate the offshore finance system, including the Panama Papers and the Pandora Papers, have stripped away some of those layers of secrecy. The assets tied to Putin's inner circle include an apartment in a Monaco luxury building overlooking the principality's glitzy harbor. The fourth-floor flat was purchased in 2003 for $4.1 million by a shell corporation called Brockville Development Ltd., a company registered in the British Virgin Islands, documents published by The Washington Post show.The real owner of the company: Svetlana Krivonogikh, a former shop cleaner from St. Petersburg who reportedly had a romantic relationship with Putin two decades ago, according to documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and reported on by the Post and The Guardian. The company was registered just weeks after Krivonogikh, who was 28 at the time, gave birth to a girl. The full 'Putin list' of Russian oligarchs and political figures released by the US Treasury                                                                                                                            Proekt, an independent Russian media outlet that was banned in the country last year, reported that Putin started a relationship with Krivonogikh in the 1990s before he became President, and that her daughter has a patronymic middle name that means \"daughter of Vladimir.\"Krivonogikh has declined to comment about Putin to reporters, but her daughter -- who had tens of thousands of Instagram followers before recently deleting her account -- has acknowledged to interviewers that she shares a resemblance to the President.  In addition to the Monaco apartment, Krivonogikh owns a majority share in a ski resort where Putin has been seen hitting the slopes, several other luxury apartments in St. Petersburg, and a yacht, the Post and the Guardian reported. The leaked documents don't make clear the source of the fortunes amassed by Putin's inner circle. But in several cases, businesses and financial institutions linked to them have won lucrative state contracts. Russia has the largest amount of wealth hidden in offshore tax havens, both in terms of absolute volume -- conservative estimates peg it around $800 billion in 2017 -- and as a percentage of national GDP, according to a 2020 report by the Atlantic Council.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you have information to share about this story? We offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\n\n\n\n\nOn average, 10% of world GDP is held offshore. However, in Russia, offshore wealth accounted for as much as 60% of GDP in 2015, according to a 2018 Journal of Public Economics research paper, the most recent estimate available. Experts say about a quarter of this dark money is indirectly controlled by Putin and his tight-knit circle of oligarchs and poses a \"serious national security threat\" to the United States. The Mueller report illustrated how Russian offshore accounts were used to interfere in the 2016 elections. Earlier this month, the Justice Department announced the formation of a task force devoted to enforcing sanctions and other economic restrictions designed to isolate Russia from global markets. The KleptoCapture task force will target not only Russian officials and oligarchs, but \"those who aid or conceal their unlawful conduct.\"White House announces new sanctions on Russian oligarchs Gary Kalman, the director of the US office of Transparency International, an anti-corruption advocacy group, said enforcing sanctions will not be easy.\"It is extraordinarily difficult for law enforcement to try and 'follow the money' because at some point you are going to literally hit a brick wall,\" Kalman said. \"There is literally no paper trail.\"The United States and the United Kingdom are ideal places to stash large amounts of money, they are among the deepest financial markets in the world, and both accept anonymous shell companies, according to the Atlantic Council.A group of international researchers found that shell companies in the US can be set up in under an hour for as little as $200, without having to legally disclose who owns or controls it. For decades, Western companies -- banks and law firms -- have profited from helping Russian oligarchs hide their money, setting up complicated corporate structures that make it nearly impossible to link assets or bank accounts to individuals.Russian President Vladimir Putin, center, and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, right, watch the Navy Day Military parade on July 27, 2014, at the main naval base of Severomorsk, Russia.In the eyes of some longtime Putin observers, the enigmatic Russian leader has shifted his focus from pursuit of wealth to consolidation of power.\"It's difficult to understand precisely what's happening inside the Kremlin and inside the mind of Vladimir Putin. But he is more and more in a tight relationship with a very small group of people, and they tend to be more on the military and intelligence side rather than business people,\" said Jill Dougherty, former Moscow bureau chief for CNN, \"because, obviously, if Putin cared about business, he would not be prosecuting this war in Ukraine.\"\"Right now it is not up to the oligarchs,\" said Stanislav Markus, an associate professor of international business at the University of South Carolina. \"It is the guns, not the money that speak loudest in the Kremlin today.\"Regardless of whether priorities have shifted inside the Kremlin, Maria Pevchikh, head of investigations Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, argues both the palace near the Black Sea and Russia's invasion of Ukraine demonstrate the way Putin sees himself as much more than a government official. \"He sees himself as a czar, as king of some sort,\" Pevchikh told CNN. \"He has huge plans. He has the vision of him being a historical figure, being so powerful, so mighty, so important, and they invest a lot of money into this narrative.\"Scott Glover contributed to this report.",

        "content": "New York (CNN Business)Connie Waters' two young granddaughters are her life, and she's only grown closer to them during the pandemic.The retired secretary from Salt Lake City babysits for Layla, 3, and Harlow, 1, three times a week while her daughter and son-in-law are at work. She also loves to watch Layla play soccer on Saturdays. But the girls live 45 minutes away, and the soccer games are even farther. The jump in gas prices has forced Waters, 64, who lives mainly off Social Security, to reconsider how often she can see them. She's already stopped going to the games, and fears she may have to cut back on caring for the girls.Connie Waters is not sure she can continue watching her granddaughters because of the high cost of gas.\"I do have such a good relationship,\" said Waters, who estimates it will now cost $60 to fill up her 2012 Ford Focus. \"And it makes me really sad to think that I might not be able to continue. And if I don't continue, what are they going to do for care?\"Like Waters, who spent about $38 to fill up her entire tank a month ago, many Americans are struggling to accommodate the swift and sudden rise in gas prices into their family budgets. The surge was sparked, in part, by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Read MoreA gallon of regular gas cost about $4.29, on average, nationwide on Thursday, according to AAA. While that's down slightly from the peak last week of $4.33 a gallon, it's still up considerably from the $3.51 a gallon drivers were paying before the invasion began a month ago.An 80-cent increase at the pump translates into nearly $700 annually on household spending on gas, according to Moody's Analytics.Tough for delivery driversThe spike in gas prices is making it harder for Chris Rivelli to make money delivering pizzas. Rivelli, a senior at Northbridge High School in Massachusetts, works five days a week in order to save for college.He now has to shell out about $70 each time he fills up his 2016 Ford Fusion, compared to less than $50 a tank when he started the gig at the end of last year. When it's busy, he might use a half tank of gas ferrying pies to customers in one shift. Chris Rivelli sometimes pays more for gas than he earns delivering pizza in Massachusetts.On a good night, he could clear $55 in tips. But typically, he only makes $30 to $35 in tips a shift, on top of his $10 hourly wage. \"With tips staying the same and gas prices going up, often times I lose money when delivering to a house because the tip does not compensate the gas I used,\" he said. \"Sad times.\"However, Rivelli, 18, plans to stick it out for now since he likes his boss and colleagues. But if prices continue to rise, he said he may have to find another job.For Nicole Humphrey, who lives in the tiny town of Buhl in rural Idaho, the increase in gas prices means she can't look for a higher-paying position in Twin Falls, which is about 30 minutes away. That's where she can find jobs that pay $15 to $20 an hour. But the commute would eat up her raise, said Humphrey, 27, who works as a clerk at a local deli and drives a 2016 Nissan Xterra. Nicole Humphrey is taking classes online and spending less time with friends because of high gas prices.Humphrey already opted to stop taking classes at the College of Southern Idaho in Twin Falls because of rising gas prices and Covid-19. She plans to finish her bachelor's degree in information technology online at Western Governors University.Curbing her driving also means Humphrey is spending less time with friends, who are mostly in Twin Falls. She studies with one classmate on Zoom, but it's not the same.\"It can be pretty isolating,\" said Humphrey. \"In areas where there are small populations that are spread out, rising costs are really hurting people.\"Limits on travelPatrick and Tracy Salyard had grand plans for the summer -- that is, until fuel prices spiked.For the past three years, the couple has lived with their two dogs in a 2002 Fleetwood Expedition motor home. After working the sugar beet harvest in Minnesota in October, they drove to Buckeye, Arizona, where they are staying until May. They put around $200 a day in their 90-gallon tank while on the road last fall, when diesel cost around $3.89 a gallon.The high price of diesel is forcing Patrick Salyard to rethink where he and his wife travel next.Now that the price of diesel is around $5 a gallon nationwide, on average, the Salyards have changed their itinerary for their next adventure. They had hoped to go to the beach in California, drive up the coast and then head across the country to New Hampshire. But now their tentative plan is to go Nashville, where they lived for many years, for a few weeks in May.What will they do after that? They aren't sure.\"Once fuel prices started rising, we knew California was like 'Well, maybe we can do that next year ... maybe',\" said Patrick Salyard, 61, noting costs are higher out West. \"Rising fuel prices have completely changed what our plans were going to be. With the way things are right now, everything is so uncertain.\"",

PepsiCo is also pulling some products from the country. The decisions followed pressure from critics and similar moves by other Western companies. On Twitter, people used boycott hashtags to target companies like McDonald's and PepsiCo that until Tuesday were quiet about their plans for Russia.McDonald's, PepsiCo and other companies were called out by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. Before McDonald's and PepsiCo made their announcements, DiNapoli emailed a number of companies represented in the New York State Common Retirement Fund, including those two companies, urging them to stop doing business with Russia. \"Companies like McDonald's and PepsiCo, which have a large footprint in Russia, need to consider whether doing business in Russia is worth the risk during this extraordinarily volatile time,\" DiNaPoli said in a statement. Read MoreOn Tuesday, McDonald's spoke out, and other major food sellers followed. McDonald'sMcDonald's said Tuesday that it is closing its Russian locations. \"McDonald's has decided to temporarily close all our restaurants in Russia and pause all operations in the market,\" CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a statement on that day.There were 847 locations of McDonald's in Russia at the close of last year, according to an investor document. Globally, most McDonald's (MCD) locations are operated by franchise operators. But that's not the case in Russia, where 84% of locations are operated by the company, according to the document. Russia's restaurants, along with another 108 in Ukraine, all operated by McDonald's, accounted for 9% of the company's revenue in 2021, according to the document. \"In Russia, we employ 62,000 people who have poured their heart and soul into our McDonald's brand to serve their communities. We work with hundreds of local, Russian suppliers and partners who produce the food for our menu and support our brand,\" Kempczinski said. \"And we serve millions of Russian customers each day who count on McDonald's. In the thirty-plus years that McDonald's has operated in Russia, we've become an essential part of the 850 communities in which we operate.\" But, he added, \"at the same time, our values mean we cannot ignore the needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraine.\" StarbucksIn a Tuesday message to employees, Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson said that \"today, we have decided to suspend all business activity in Russia.\" He added that \"our licensed partner has agreed to immediately pause store operations and will provide support to the nearly 2,000 [employees] in Russia who depend on Starbucks for their livelihood.\" Johnson added that Starbucks is halting shipment of all Starbucks products to Russia. \"We condemn the horrific attacks on Ukraine by Russia and our hearts go out to all those affected,\" he said. CokeCoca-Cola also said Tuesday that it is \"suspending its business in Russia.\" The company stated that \"our hearts are with the people who are enduring unconscionable effects from these tragic events in Ukraine,\" adding that it will monitor the situation as things change. PepsiCo, Danone and UnileverOn Tuesday, PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta laid out how PepsiCo is approaching the situation.\"Given the horrific events occurring in Ukraine we are announcing the suspension of the sale of Pepsi-Cola, and our global beverage brands in Russia, including 7Up and Mirinda.\" Laguarta added that Pepsi is suspending capital investments, ads and promotional activity in Russia. But PepsiCo will continue to sell some of its products, including baby formula, baby food, milk and other dairy options.\"We have a responsibility to continue to offer our other products in Russia, including daily essentials,\" Laguarta said. \"By continuing to operate, we will also continue to support the livelihoods of our 20,000 Russian associates and the 40,000 Russian agricultural workers in our supply chain as they face significant challenges and uncertainty ahead,\" he added. Farryl Bertmann, a registered dietitian and senior lecturer in the nutrition and food sciences department at the University of Vermont, warned that if big food companies leave Russia entirely the citizen population could suffer, even if they have other sources of food. \"I feel very strongly that people should be given the opportunity to purchase a variety of foods at different price points,\" she said. \"That can only be successfully done if access is there.\" She said that \"ultimately, foods need to be made available,\" adding, \"I would be very concerned if the food environment [were] to dramatically change.\" Other companies have taken a similar approach to Pepsi.Danone (DANOY), which makes Silk milk alternatives, Activia, Oikos yogurt, baby formula and more, said in a LinkedIn post on Sunday that \"we have decided to suspend all investment projects in Russia,\" adding that it would \"maintain our production and distribution of fresh dairy products and infant nutrition, to still meet the essential food needs of the local population.\" Unilever (UL) made a similar statement this week, saying that \"we will continue to supply our everyday essential food and hygiene products made in Russia to people in the country,\" adding \"we will keep this under close review.\" The company noted it is has suspended imports of its products to Russia and is stopping all investment in the country, in addition to stopping exports from there.

        "content": "New York (CNN Business)When McDonald's opened its doors in Moscow for the first time, it was a big deal. It was the dead of winter \u2014 January 31, in 1990 \u2014 but still people came out in droves. Grainy CNN television footage shows lines snaking out the door, and throngs of people inside, trying Big Macs for the first time.The Pushkin Square location was massive, with the capacity to seat hundreds of people. It was the largest McDonald's restaurant in the world at the time. Inside, the fast food joint was bustling. In most ways, it looked like any other McDonald's from the era. But there was a hammer-and-sickle flag under the golden arches and an international theme inside, featuring a model of London's Big Ben in the dining room.McDonald's, Starbucks and Coca-Cola leave RussiaBright-eyed McDonald's employees wearing maroon branded visors and big smiles took customer orders. They were the chosen ones \u2014 about 630 employees made the cut out of 27,000 applicants, according to a 1990 Washington Post article. They underwent a month of training before the store opened for business.The golden arches were an immediate success. On the first day, 30,000 people were served, a McDonald's record for an opening day, the CBC reported at the time. The location even had to stay open for hours later than planned because of the crowds. Soviet customers stand in line outside the just opened first McDonald's in the Soviet Union on January 31,1990 at Moscow's Pushkin Square. Read MoreMcDonald's arrival in Moscow was about more than just Big Macs and fries, noted Darra Goldstein, Willcox B. and Harriet M. Adsit professor of Russian, emerita, at Williams College. It was the most prominent example of glasnost in action, Soviet Union President Mikhail Gorbechev's attempt to open up his crumbling country to international relations.\"There was a really visible crack in the Iron Curtain,\" she said. \"It was very symbolic about the changes that were taking place.\" About two years later, the Soviet Union would collapse. After that first spot opened up, McDonald's expanded its reach within the country. As of last week, there were about 850 locations operating in Russia. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine prompted McDonald's to change course, at least temporarily. On Tuesday, the company announced that it would pause operations at those restaurants, following similar decisions by other Western firms and pressure from critics. For Goldstein, this moment is just as symbolic, but far less hopeful.  \"If the opening of McDonald's in 1990 symbolized the beginning of a new era in Soviet life, one with greater freedoms, then the company's current exit represents not just a closing down of business, but of society as a whole,\" she said.How McDonald's got to Moscow Hundreds of people line up around the first McDonald's restaurant in the Soviet Union at Moscow's Pushkin Square, on its opening day.Opening McDonald's up in Russia wasn't easy. George Cohon, who oversaw McDonald's business in Canada from the early 1970s and into the 1990s, led the campaign to bring McDonald's to life in Moscow. It took 14 years to make that happen. In his book, To Russia With Fries (with an introduction by none other than Gorbachev) Cohon detailed the difficult process of opening up that first location. \"On the Soviet side, there was very little real understanding of what was involved in establishing or operating a chain of McDonald's restaurants,\" he wrote. \"For our part, we had to identify suitable sites (the Soviets' instincts seemed to be to put us behind the elevator shafts in hotels or somewhere in the outskirts of Moscow; our instincts, naturally, were pretty much the reverse).\" UK sanctions Russian oligarch and Chelsea owner Roman AbramovichPerhaps more pressing than finding a suitable location was the search for a viable supply chain. McDonald's needed a steady supply of patties and potatoes for the thousands of people who would stream in every day. \"We had to satisfy ourselves that it would be possible to source raw materials in Russia,\" he said. Cohon and other members of the team visited local food processing plants and found them lacking. McDonald's decided to set up its own. \"In the absence of a reliable infrastructure, we were going to have to build one,\" Cohon wrote. \"We were going to have to go right into the countryside and develop a network of suppliers that didn't exist before.\" When McDonald's did finally open its doors in 1990, some were skeptical and believed it wouldn't last. \"It will all go downhill. We don't know how to run a restaurant like this,\" Andrei Grushin, an engineer who visited the restaurant on opening day, told the Washington Post at the time. But the pains McDonald's took paid off. Service with a smile One of the defining characteristics of the Moscow McDonald's location, at least on that first day, was the friendly staff. \"They are always smiling,\" a young employee told CNN reporters on opening day. \"As you know, in Moscow, not in every restaurant you can find smiling people.\" Another employee told the CBC that when she smiled at people, they asked what was wrong. \"They think that I'm laughing at them,\" she said.  At that time in the Soviet Union, \"food service was really terrible,\" said Williams College's Goldstein. \"It was rude, places were dirty. There often wasn't food that was listed.\" McDonald's was an \"almost magical place where food always replenished itself and people smiled at you,\" she said. \"It represented more than just a place to get American hamburgers.\" The hamburgers themselves weren't as exciting, at least not to some customers. \"I don't like it at all,\" one man told the CBC of the food, shaking his head. Another said he liked the cuisine, but had \"expected more.\" The meal was pricey. A meal could cost half a day's pay for the average consumer, according to the CBC. How Putin 'destroyed' the ruble and brought Russia to the brink of defaultOlga Berman, who grew up in Moscow before immigrating to the United States in 1993, recalled a trip to McDonald's with her family when she was a child. \"We didn't really go out to eat a ton. So that was a huge experience in itself, to go to restaurants,\" she said. She remembers McDonald's as \"sparkling new,\" she said. \"It was really bright. It was super clean,\" she added. \"It was an experience. it didn't feel like fast food that I know today. It felt like going to an actual restaurant.\" And the food? \"I don't even remember what the food was like,\" she said. Christina Frankopan grew up in London. As a teenager, she went to Moscow for a few weeks to improve her Russian, right around the time of the opening of the first McDonald's location. In spring 1990, she went with friends to check it out.\"I went once or twice and the queue was just too long,\" she said. \"And, and then eventually, we went one time, and it was doable.\" For Frankopan, McDonald's was no big deal. But her friends were excited \u2014 less about the food, as she recalled, than about the chain's styrofoam containers. \"I was surprised that actually, the packaging was highly coveted,\" she said. Frankopan remembers people taking the packaging home and tacking it up on their walls. They said \"it's an incredibly good insulating material,\" she recalled. But \"I think, actually, it was a status symbol to be able to show, not only do I have one Big Mac box, I have queued for, you know, 15 times to get my Big Mac boxes.\" She added, \"I think it's hard to overstate the symbolism of the place.\" As CNN reporter Richard Blystone put it, when he reported the story 32 years ago, \"a Western hamburger emporium in Moscow has all the intrinsic appeal of an ice cream stand in hell.\"McDonald's pauses Russian operations A McDonald's in Moscow circa 2021. After years of investment, everything came crashing down this week. \"In Russia, we employ 62,000 people who have poured their heart and soul into our McDonald's brand to serve their communities. We work with hundreds of local, Russian suppliers and partners who produce the food for our menu and support our brand. And we serve millions of Russian customers each day who count on McDonald's,\" McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a statement on Tuesday. \"In the thirty-plus years that McDonald's has operated in Russia, we've become an essential part of the 850 communities in which we operate,\" he added. But the current situation makes continuing in the market untenable, according to the executive, at least for now.  \"Our values mean we cannot ignore the needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraine,\" Kempczinski said. Plus, with the region in upheaval, McDonald's can no longer reliably secure the supply it needs.  \"We are experiencing disruptions to our supply chain along with other operational impacts,\" he said. After 32 years, \"McDonald's has decided to temporarily close all our restaurants in Russia and pause all operations in the market.\" McDonald's will continue to pay its employees in Russia, the company said. But it's not clear when Russians will be able to visit a local McDonald's again. \"At this juncture, it's impossible to predict when we might be able to reopen our restaurants in Russia,\" Kempczinski said.",

        "content": "New York (CNN Business)Kohl's isn't the flashiest retailer in America. But it's a go-to store for millions of moms. Kohl's has connected with mid-aged, middle-income women through a mix of stylish clothing brands and a knack for quickly reacting to the latest fashion trends.Wall Street has taken notice. Kohl's (KSS) is one of the hottest retail stocks over the past year, outperforming peers like Macy's (M), Nordstrom (JWN), JCPenney (JCP), and Gap (GPS).Much of Kohl's recent success can be attributed to the department store's improved tactics in its top business: Women's clothes.Doubling down on women's clothesRead MoreKohl's women's apparel division accounts for about a third of the company's roughly $19 billion in annual sales. Kohl's stands out against competitors because it makes a big chunk of the clothes it sells, under three $1 billion private-label brands \u2014 Sonoma Goods for Life, Apt. 9 and Croft & Barrow. It also has relationships with designers for exclusive lines, such as LC Lauren Conrad and Simply Vera Vera Wang. Private-label and exclusive brands make up 70% of Kohl's women's business and 42% of the company overall. By comparison, private labels represent 20% of Macy's total sales. Exclusive brands, like one with fashion designer Vera Wang, help Kohl's stand out against rivals.Controlling the supply chain for those clothes is a big advantage for Kohl's. It can nimbly respond to shoppers' style preferences and minimize inventory mistakes, such as ordering too many heavy jackets during a warm winter. In recent years, Kohl's has focused on mastering the basics to strengthen its shopping experience.For example, it has narrowed choices on the shelves to reduce clutter. It has also sped up the manufacturing timeline by 30% to move clothes from initial drawing stages to the shelves. The approach is paying off. Last quarter, Kohl's own brands had their best performance in five years. Inventory fell 8% per store, signaling that shoppers grabbed up just about everything they could find off store shelves.\"Kohl's has done an admirable job by investing in desirable products customers want,\" said Oliver Chen, a retail analyst at Cowen.Next year, Kohl's will start selling Nine West shoes, handbags, and an exclusive clothing line. It's adding a new private-label plus-size clothing brand, EVRI, and heightening the label around the stores with more racks and larger mannequins. The company sees an opportunity to appeal to women searching for fashion in extended sizes. Those mannequins will help Kohl's showcase EVRI in stores.Retailers wake up to opportunity in plus-size clothingKohl's is also chasing more Millennial women. It recently started selling PopSugar at Kohl's \u2014 a collection of tees, tops, skirts and shorts curated by the digital media company.\"We see an opportunity to draw more Millennial customers and young families to Kohl's,\" Greg Revelle, Kohl's chief marketing officer, said about the tie-up with PopSugar. Running with athleisure brandsKohl's has made an expanded push into selling more athletic brands, too. The strategy has driven sales and helped the company attract new, younger shoppers.Nike has become Kohl's largest national brand partner, and Adidas products are a top seller at its stores. Last year, Kohl's began offering Under Armour merchandise for the first time.\"Active and wellness is a permanent part of the American landscape. And we want to be the destination,\" CEO Kevin Mansell said earlier this year. Michele Gass, Starbucks' former marketing guru, took over for Mansell in May.The active and wellness division has grown to more than 15% of Kohl's overall sales.Kohl's is making a big bet on athletic brands like Under Armour and Nike.As part of Kohl's efforts to become a go-to athleisure retailer, it is testing expanded floor space for top athletic brands at 30 stores.Tie-ups with Amazon and AldiInvestors believe that Kohl's is well prepared for the future. Kohl's mastery of retail fundamentals gives it flexibility to rethink its store layouts and take risks.Over the last few years, Kohl's has reduced the size of 500 stores \u2014 close to half of its fleet \u2014 from 90,000 square-feet to 65,000 and 35,000 square-feet. The company makes the same amount of sales at those stores, but it saves money by carrying less inventory and employing fewer workers. For shoppers, Kohl's says the smaller format is easier to navigate. Most of its stores are located away from struggling malls. Reorganizing store space creates opportunities for outside-the-box thinking, too.While many retailers are fighting against Amazon, Kohl's has joined with the online seller. It offers free returns for Amazon.com purchases at more than 100 stores in Los Angeles, Chicago, and Milwaukee. Kohl's is also experimenting selling Amazon Echo and smart home devices at designated stations within 20 stores. More recently, executives announced a test with grocery chain Aldi to lease out 5 to 10 stores next to Kohl's beginning next year. Kohl's is looking to fill the spaces with other retailers and grocers that can help stores attract traffic. Chen believes Planet Fitness could be an attractive partner for Kohl's or even Amazon Go cashier-less stores.Bringing on complementary retailers' customers is a crucial part of Kohl's attempt to future-proof its business. Kohl's has had trouble growing sales since it doesn't offer a ton of must-have brands. Its shoppers are less fashion-driven than Macy's or Nordstrom's customers and likelier to stay home when the weather is rough, Chen said. Plus, TJX Companies (TJX) and Ross Stores (ROST) have undercut Kohl's in recent years with rock-bottom prices and a treasure hunt-like shopping experience.",

        "content": "New York (CNN Business)Kohl's has built a loyal shopping base of middle-aged moms. Now, it's pivoting to chase a group of customers it has struggled with: Millennials. \"We have not done our job,\" Kohl's CEO Michelle Gass said last year of the department store's history with Millennial shoppers. For Gass, who stepped into the top job at Kohl's a year ago, winning younger customers remains a key priority as she tries to make the 57-year-old retailer more relevant for a new generation of shoppers.Stores live in fear of Amazon. The Kohl's CEO embraced itOn-the-go Millennials don't want to spend time roaming around big-box retail stores searching for the right size and style, analysts and Kohl's executives say. They mix different brands and dress to fleeting fashion trends, which are often driven by social-media influencers. Younger shoppers also demand exciting store experiences, and quick and easy solutions for their wardrobe challenges.\"People are time-starved,\" Kohl's chief merchandising officer Doug Howe said in an interview. Shoppers in focus groups told Kohl's that they struggled to find what they wanted when shopping its nearly 90,000 square-foot stores and had trouble matching clothes together spread out across the stores. Plus, \"Millennial customers don't buy one brand head to toe,\" he said. Kohl's is testing new outfit bars near the entrance of 50 stores in Philadelphia and Chicago in a play for Millennial shoppers.Read MoreLast year, Kohl's (KSS) created a \"Millennial Initiative\" team to develop ideas for experiences in stores and online that might attract younger customers.The task force's biggest bet yet: A Pinterest-like \"outfit bar\" at stores that lets women shop by \"look\" for work and social occasions \u2014 in one place.Kohl's is starting slow, rolling out the outfit bars near the entrance of 50 stores in Philadelphia and Chicago this spring. But executives' expectations for the initiative are high. \"We haven't made, historically, this bold of a move,\" Howe said.'Life is short. Get the outfit.'CNN Business got an exclusive visit to the first outfit bar in Havertown, Pennsylvania, a suburb outside Philadelphia, the day it opened in late April.In the 600-square-foot section, Kohl's pulls together a curated mix of its national brands like Levi (LEVI), Nike (NKE) and Champion, as well as a few of its in-house clothing lines. The outfit bar gets prime real estate: The section is one of the first things customers see when they enter the store.A foldable floor sign at the front of the section introduces customers to the new concept: \"The outfit bar. Find your new favorite look.\" Toward the ceiling in the back of the section, lit-up white letters read, \"Life is short. Get the outfit,\" set against a neon green grass sign. It all seems tailor-made for Instagram.In the middle of the open section, three mannequins display varied styles: a sporty outfit, a sleek jumpsuit and blouse-and-skirt basics. PopSugar pants and tops and Champion jackets hang on side racks, while Levi's jeans are laid out on a table.A sign in the outfit bar encourages time-strapped shoppers to grab one of the looks Kohl's features in the section.There's a green jacket, denim jeans and a graphic T-shirt proclaiming \"off-duty fun,\" while a multi-colored track jacket, denim skirt and Adidas sneakers comprise an \"activewear anywhere\" outfit. The outfit bar also features elevated wooden fixtures, which allow Kohl's to slide in  LC Lauren Conrad heels and Adidas sneakers to show shoppers how an outfit might pair with shoes. Elizabeth Labor, 29, who was shopping at Kohl's for a job interview, told CNN Business she gave the outfit bar high marks.Labor said the \"abundance of choices\" at Kohl's often made it difficult for her to decide how to match clothes. But she found the outfit bar helpful. \"It was cool to get some ideas of what you could piece together,\" she said.That's the goal for Kohl's: to give Millennials a distinct area in the store where they can quickly find styles and discover clothes they didn't know the retailer carries. The concept is a way for Kohl's to show off its hottest wares to existing Millennial customers and build cachet among new ones. Kohl's is partnering with influencers like Lilliana Vazquez to curate the outfit bar selection. Styles in the section will be updated every 30 days.Kohl's will partner with stylists and social media personalities\u2014the first will be Today Show contributor Lilliana Vazquez\u2014 to curate the outfit bar selection and update it every 30 days with new looks to give shoppers a reason to keep returning to stores. A companion landing page on Kohl's site also allows customers to shop by outfit, instead of browsing by brand or clothing type. And Kohl's will promote the outfit bar on social media to help boost customers' awareness.The concept \"should help Kohl's create a compelling area in store that is more attuned to the needs of Millennial shoppers,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData Retail.Generational shiftKohl's average shopper is 45, according to customer surveys from Cowen. That's a year older than Macy's (M) and JCPenney's (JCP) average shopper, two years older than Target's (TGT) and four years older than the average shopper at discount chains TJMaxx (TJX) and Marshalls. Amazon (AMZN) Prime shoppers are also younger than Kohl's, according to Cowen.Kohl's draws heavily from customers over 65 too, according to data from Morgan Stanley. Kohl's is shrinking stores and leasing out the extra space to Planet FitnessGreg Revelle, Kohl's chief marketing officer, said sweeping demographic shifts led Kohl's to go after Millennials, who have overtaken Baby Boomers as the largest generation in the United States. Also, he noted, about a million Millennial women every year become first-time moms. \"We want to win as all these women make that transition,\" Revelle said.Strength with momsThe approach marks a shift for Kohl's, which has historically directed its efforts on strengthening its relationship with middle-aged moms.\"A number of our initiatives have really been around satisfying that core customer,\" Revelle said.Kohl's has connected with moms through a mix of stylish clothing brands and a knack for quickly reacting to the latest fashion trends. The company's women's clothing business accounts for close to a third of overall sales, and Kohl's relies heavily on its own brands.But now Kohl's wants to improve with Millennials.     \"Kohl's is simply not on the fashion radar of many younger shoppers,\" said Saunders. \"There are many Millennial consumers who just don't set foot in its stores.\"About 29% of Millennial women said they shopped at Kohl's over the past year, compared to 50% at Target, 33% at TJMaxx and 31% at Macy's, according to GlobalData Retail data.\"We have a particular opportunity to gain share among Millennials, especially Millennial moms,\" Gass, the Kohl's CEO, said in March. \"We expect to make a lot of progress.\"The Pinterest effectKohl's has taken several steps in recent years to target young moms.It started investing in digital and TV advertisements to reach customers under 35 for the first time. It's focused in particular on Pinterest, which Revelle said is \"sort of the new style platform.\" Pinterest lets users bookmark or \"pin\" images ranging from clothing to home design.It has also brought in new brands including Under Armour (UA) and PopSugar to appeal to Millennials. Kohl's will closely study the outfit bars' performance for the next three months before making a decision about putting them in more stores. Executives will assess whether the outfit bar clothes perform better than they do elsewhere in the store. And, of course, they'll measure whether the concept brings in Millennial customers. Mannequins display varied styles in the outfit bar: a sporty outfit, a sleek jumpsuit and blouse-and-skirt basics. Howe, Kohl's merchandising chief, said a similar concept could one day make it over to Kohl's men's department, too.Though it's online trends like Pinterest and social-media influencers who helped inform the creation of the outfit bar, Kohl's believes its more than 1,150 brick-and-mortar stores give it an advantage to draw Millennials.\"We're seeing a lot of these Millennials starting to shop more in stores, particularly when they're shopping for their families,\" said Revelle. \"It's much easier to look through everything, find what you like and check out. Plus, of course, you don't have to wait for delivery.\"Fighting off Target and TJMaxx As Kohl's battles for Millennial dollars, so are a large mix of big box retailers, brands and department stores.Target (TGT) has aggressively courted young parents by adding trendy new private-label clothing brands, such as A New Day, JoyLab and kids' line Cat & Jack.How Target is trying to woo mom and dadsTarget is \"a popular destination for female Millennials and its new in-house fashion brands have been well received,\" said Saunders. It has improved the store experience by creating mini-sections in stores for it top brands. Walmart (WMT) has also stepped up its fashion game by partnering with celebrities like Ellen DeGeneres and Sofia Vergara for exclusive clothing lines and buying up hip online brands such as ModCloth and Eloquii.In the department store realm, Macy's recently unveiled Story, a new section in more than 30 stores that will change brands and concepts every few months to get customers to keep coming back to see what's new. Under a new CEO, JCPenney has poached executives from Target in recent months. Analysts believe it may be trying to follow Target's successful private-label strategy.And discount chains like TJMaxx and Ross (ROST), which have younger customer bases than Kohl's, are winning Millennials with low prices on stylish basics.For Kohl's to gain ground on those chains among highly coveted Millennials, it \"does need to reinvent the store experience,\" said Saunders.",

        "content": "New York (CNN Business)Clipping coupons is an American pastime. Reality shows devoted to extreme couponers have become sensations. But many companies that issue coupons hate them. Critics say coupons are expensive, wasteful and inefficient advertising. Some companies have gone to great lengths to get rid of them.It didn't end well.A devoted base of shoppers loves the hunt of clipping coupons from newspaper booklets and, more recently, on their phones. Many will buy products solely on the offers they can find. Why every Costco product is called 'Kirkland Signature'Redeeming coupons makes shoppers feel smart \u2014 like they've outfoxed a brand \u2014 and gives them something to brag about to their friends. One study found customers who received coupons released feel-good oxytocin hormones and their heart rates decreased. Read More\"If you can go into the store and walk out getting paid \u2014 some people chase that,\" said Jessie Alonzo, who runs the coupon blog MoolaSavingMom.com and shares coupon strategies with followers. \"It's like a high.\"In the grocery industry, 865 million coupons were redeemed last year, according to marketing and payment services' firm Vericast.The rise of couponsCoupons have evolved over the years since Coca-Cola popularized them in the late 1880s.To promote Coca-Cola to the public, the bookkeeper of John Pemberton \u2014 the pharmacist who invented the Coke formula \u2014 used a city directory to mail coupons to Atlanta citizens, according to the company.Later on Asa Candler, founder of the Coca-Cola company, distributed paper tickets for complimentary free glasses of Coke. Within two decades, Coke had handed out an estimated 8.5 million free drink vouchers.Coupon use took off during the Great Depression. Some of the early distribution methods were newspapers and women's magazines, according to the Association of Coupon Professionals, a trade group for the industry.As chain supermarkets expanded in the 1940s, coupons became a widespread practice. The introduction in the mid-20th century of direct mail coupons and freestanding inserts in newspapers also propelled their popularity.By the 1970s, 65% of US households were clipping coupons, according to the trade group.Coupon clipping is a shopping ritual.Printed inserts in newspapers were the most-used coupons for decades, but the rise of online shopping and smartphone apps made digital coupons more popular. Coupons vs. salesCoupons are different than products on sale, price promotions or discounts at the store. Sales are available to all customers when they walk in or buy online. But brands target coupons in mailings and websites to reach the shoppers who are fiercely loyal to them.\"Coupons play an important role giving brands a chance to reach and activate shoppers who aren't making a brand choice\" based on sale prices on shelves, said Aimee Englert, executive director of client strategy at Vericast. \"Coupons help get a brand on the shopping list.\"Brands also dangle coupons whenever they introduce new products to spur shoppers to test them. Sometimes, companies also offer coupons to push shoppers to sign up for their loyalty programs.Coupons are expected to play a bigger role for shoppers as prices remain high. Sixty percent of shoppers said they were looking for more coupons to offset higher prices, according to an online survey of more than 1,800 customers in July by Vericast. \"We are starting to see customers engaging in coupons a little bit more aggressively than before,\" Kroger (KR) CEO Rodney McMullen said on a call with analysts Thursday. Coupon failsBut coupons aren't loved by everyone.Brands and retailers dislike them because they prime shoppers to only buy products at deep discounts, making it harder for them to sell their merchandise at more profitable full-prices. Companies have said offering coupons is a waste of money that would be better directed toward dropping prices across the board or investing in improving their products' quality. Some companies have even likened coupons to a drug. \"You're taking money and you're essentially paying the consumer to buy your product,\" said Kimberly Whitler, an associate professor at the University of Virginia's Darden School of Business and former marketing executive at David's Bridal and PetSmart. \"It's taking away resources from building longer term, more sustainable equity in the brand.\" Coupons also can create challenges in predicting demand and keeping products in stock. It's much simpler and easier on operations to keep prices consistent. What's more, coupons cost money to design and produce, and some customers redeem expired coupons or fraudulent ones.\"The first time you do a coupon, it's awesome because it's incremental,\" Whitler said. \"The problem is now it's baked into your base. You have to maintain that coupon.\" Macy's, JCPenney and other brands have unsuccessfully tried to kill coupons.But most brands have decided coupons are a necessary evil and remain a part of their pricing strategies. They're afraid to eliminate them for fear of driving away customers or losing business to competitors that keep them.Retail history is littered with cautionary tales of brands that tried to quit coupons and failed.In 1996, Procter & Gamble (PG), the maker of Tide, Crest and Bounty, experimented with a \"zero coupon test\" in three upstate New York markets where stores had opted to offer customers double or even triple the value of the manufacturer's coupons. P&G said it would pass its savings on marketing costs to consumers in the form of lower prices.\"More than 300 billion coupons are issued annually and less than 2% are being redeemed,\" said P&G's then-chief operating officer Durk Jager. \"Some 8 million trees are cut down for coupons annually. About 40% of total coupon spending never reaches the consumer. We decided coupons have to go.\"But P&G's move alienated loyal coupon clippers in the area and they switched to competitors. Some of P&G's competitors also joined the test, such as Clorox (CLX) and Colgate (CL), and the New York attorney general filed an antitrust lawsuit against the companies. P&G brought back coupons and agreed to pay $4.2 million to settle the lawsuit, along with other manufacturers.Nine years later, Macy's (M) (then Federated Department Stores) acquired regional department stores that were known for their coupons and pulled back on them, hoping to wean the customers off them. But Macy's abandoned the plan after sales plunged: \"Coupons are a religion in the Midwest,\" one analyst said at the time.JCPenney had the biggest coupon misfire.Customers use coupons while purchasing items at the checkout counter of a J.C. Penney Co. store at the Gateway Shopping Center in the Brooklyn borough of New York, U.S., on Saturday, Aug. 8, 2015.In 2012, Ron Johnson, the former head of Apple's retail stores and a Target executive who became the new JCPenney CEO, unveiled a sweeping overhaul of the chain. Central to the strategy was a plan to end coupons and discounts and replace them with low \"everyday\" prices.\"Rather than inundating the customer with a relentless series of sales, coupons, rebates and retail gimmicks,\" Penney shifted to \"Fair and Square\" prices.The plan backfired.Sales tanked nearly 25% in a year and the company's stock plunged. Johnson lost his job after just 17 months and Penney quickly brought back coupons. \"We did not realize how deep some of the customers were into [coupons],\" an executive said at the time.Johnson agreed: \"Coupons were a drug.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Months before Disney CEO Bob Chapek tiptoed into a roiling debate in Florida and before the legislation that opponents would call the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill was even filed, Gov. Ron DeSantis delivered a threat to business leaders who got in his way. \"If you are in one of these corporations, if you're a woke CEO, you want to get involved in our legislative business, look, it's a free country,\" the Florida Republican said last June. \"But understand, if you do that, I'm fighting back against you. And I'm going to make sure that people understand your business practices, and anything I don't like about what you're doing.\"DeSantis this month made clear he wasn't bluffing. A day after Chapek publicly condemned a controversial Florida bill that would ban classroom instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity before fourth grade, DeSantis ripped Disney to a room of supporters. He called Disney a \"woke corporation\" and criticized its business interests in China. Fox obtained and posted a video from the private event, and DeSantis and his staff helped spread it on social media.For DeSantis, already considered a future presidential contender, the episode has only further bolstered his standing within his party, and it has exposed a widening chasm between the current crop of Republican leaders and the corporations that have traditionally curried favor with the GOP. More and more, Republicans, once loath to criticize big business, have adopted former President Donald Trump's approach of calling out corporations whose stances on hot-button issues they disagree with. One longtime Republican consultant in Florida, who asked not to be named in order to speak freely about DeSantis and Disney, told CNN it was \"a different day for the corporate-loving GOP in Florida.\"Read More\"This thing with Disney, this is his modus operandi,\" the consultant said of DeSantis. \"There's no playbook anymore for corporations. You just have to take your lumps.\"  What the bill dubbed 'Don't Say Gay' by critics actually saysDisney has faced internal strife and a public reckoning in the days leading up to and after the bill's passage by the Florida Legislature. Chapek, who first said in a tepid statement that Disney's involvement would be \"counterproductive\" and did not publicly criticize the bill until it had passed, later apologized to his LGBTQ employees, telling them, \"You needed me to be a stronger ally in the fight for equal rights and I let you down. I am sorry.\" The fallout continued Wednesday as some Disney employees staged walkouts. Meanwhile, conservative pundits flocked to Twitter to praise DeSantis for standing up to the entertainment giant. One commentator for the National Review wrote that DeSantis had given Republicans \"a playbook for confronting woke ideology going forward.\" Disney did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Leaning into fightsTo the outside world, it was perhaps surprising that a Republican governor would put his state's best-known company on blast. Disney, after all, isn't just an iconic brand, it's also a main driver behind the tourism industry that helps keep Florida's income tax-less economy afloat. Before the pandemic, the theme park annually drew nearly as many visitors as there are people in the state (about 20 million), and it employs 77,000 Floridians.But unlike past GOP leaders, DeSantis has been unmoved by corporate pressure or threats of economic boycott over divisive policies. Rather, he has gained a national following by leaning into fights, no matter who is on the receiving end.One Republican noted that the legislation Disney objected to didn't originate with DeSantis and said his involvement was initially minimal. When he first remarked on the bill officially titled \"Parental Rights in Education\" in February, DeSantis acknowledged that there weren't many instances of Florida classrooms teaching about sexual orientation and identity.But as outrage against the bill spread throughout the country, to late-night television and the White House, DeSantis and his team began to aggressively push back. After \"Saturday Night Live\" poked fun at the bill, the governor's spokeswoman tweeted that anyone who opposed the measure was \"probably a groomer,\" a term used to describe a sexual predator who trains a victim to trust the predator. Opponents of the bill said her comments evoked ugly, debunked arguments used in the past by anti-gay activists to diminish and demean the LGBTQ community.Florida state legislature leads the charge on a number of GOP prioritiesWith the bill gaining momentum, Disney, which is headquartered in Burbank, California, but has 38 registered lobbyists in Florida, worked behind the scenes with state lawmakers to try to soften the legislation. It passed both Republican-controlled chambers largely unchanged.Chapek told shareholders March 9 that he had called DeSantis after the bill passed the state Senate to convey the company's \"disappointment and concern.\" DeSantis' office said his support for the legislation hadn't wavered. He then went public with his criticism of Disney.\"When you have companies that have made a fortune off being family-friendly and catering to families and young kids, they should understand that parents of young kids do not want this injected into their kids' kindergarten classroom,\" DeSantis told supporters in the video reported by Fox. This time, he didn't mention that there are few examples of this occurring in Florida. As a Republican legislative aide told CNN, \"It's like Ron Burgundy said: That escalated quickly.\" Christopher Miles, a Miami-based GOP consultant, said watching a Florida governor go after Disney was \"not a world I expected to be living in a couple of years ago.\" But he said DeSantis, like Trump, has gained popularity by bucking conventional wisdom.The surprise isn't that DeSantis pounced, Miles said, it's that Mickey Mouse walked into the trap.\"If you come at Ron DeSantis directly, he will come after you. He has made that clear,\" Miles said. \"It's almost like Disney gave him a nice platform to run for president, and it was a good opportunity for him to spike the football. If you draw DeSantis into a fight, he's going to go to the mat.\"A shift within the GOPDisney's unsuccessful attempt to fight the Florida bill may also be the latest sign of corporate leaders' dwindling sway over state governments when it comes to divisive policies.Last year, Georgia marched ahead with legislation that put new voting restrictions in place despite objections from some of the state's largest businesses and Major League Baseball, which pulled its All-Star Game out of Atlanta.By the time Florida passed its own bill to limit early voting, the business community was largely silent.The NCAA issued a statement last year signaling it could pull championship events from states that altered the eligibility status of transgender athletes. Undeterred, DeSantis signed a bill banning transgender athletes from girls' and women's scholastic sports.The NCAA still held the men's and women's Division I Cross Country Championships in Tallahassee, only a few miles from where the anti-transgender legislation became law. Florida is scheduled to host several more championships in the coming years.\"If you don't want to hold an event in my state, you know what, I got a lot of events in my state,\" DeSantis said at the time. \"I'm not worried about that.\"LGBTQ Floridians once hoped DeSantis could be an ally. Not anymoreIn the past, corporate leaders were able to convince some Republican politicians that contentious social policy bills would stifle economic activity in their states. In 2015, blowback was swift in Indiana when then-Gov. Mike Pence signed a bill making it legal for businesses to reject service to LGBTQ people if they cited religious exemptions. Criticism came from corporations, sports leagues and conventions, which warned of economic repercussions. Within 10 days, Pence signed new legislation softening the law.Before Disney weighed in, the Florida bill hadn't stirred that kind of response from businesses. \"The folks who consider the GOP to be pro-business, that's not how they have been acting,\" said Cathryn Oakley, state legislative director and senior counsel at the Human Rights Campaign, the country's largest LGBTQ advocacy group. The organization recently rejected a $5 million donation from Disney because it felt the company hadn't done enough to stop the bill from passing in Florida.But Republicans remain convinced that overzealous corporate leaders are using their power to suppress conservative voices and ideals. Other than President Joe Biden and the media industry, no entity at last month's Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando was treated as a greater threat to America than the corporate boardroom. An entire panel at CPAC was devoted to fighting back against what participants saw as the leftward lurch of multinational corporations. Pundits and politicians took turns knocking Fortune 500 companies such as Facebook, Spotify and even Coca-Cola, and attendees were encouraged to spend their money at businesses that were in line with their values.\"It is really important that we start building our own institutions and our own little networks that are friendly to the American way of life,\" said Terry Schilling, the president of the conservative American Principles Project.Fundraising pauseChapek announced after passage of the LGBTQ topics instruction bill that Disney would halt political contributions in Florida. Disney has been a prolific donor to Florida campaigns, mostly to Republicans, contributing more than $2.1 million to candidates and committees since the start of 2021. The company had previously donated $50,000 to DeSantis' bid for reelection this year.The DeSantis campaign released its response on Tuesday: A video of a campaign worker delivering the text of the legislation to Disney's headquarters in Central Florida and a message to \"Just read the bill.\"Chapek said DeSantis had agreed to meet with Disney's LGBTQ employees. DeSantis' office said it was not aware any meeting had been scheduled.Disney shows off its post-Iger politicsDeSantis' dust-up with Disney has provided fodder for his political opponents in Florida, but few within the state's business community are coming to the company's defense. The Florida Chamber of Commerce and the Associated Industries of Florida, two top business groups, have remained silent throughout the saga. Neither responded to requests for comment.Nor have Republicans publicly defended Disney, their longtime campaign benefactor. One Republican aide said it was too soon to know the full impact of Disney's pullback on the GOP's ability to fundraise. In addition to cutting Republicans big checks, Disney properties often host GOP events at no cost to the party.It is unlikely to make a difference to DeSantis, who already has $89 million for his reelection fight.\"He thinks it doesn't matter. He's got a bottomless pit of goodwill, and his base will support him,\" said Ron Book, a longtime Florida lobbyist. \"Everything he does, he's talking to his base.\"CNN's Frank Pallotta contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)Lawmakers in Florida gave final approval Tuesday to a bill that would ban certain instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom, sending the controversial bill to the desk of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has signaled his support for the measure.Florida's GOP-controlled Senate passed HB 1557, titled the Parental Rights in Education bill, in a 22-17 vote. The state House had approved the bill late last month. Conservatives have argued that the bill is needed in order to give parents greater oversight over what students learn and discuss at school, stressing that LGBTQ-related topics should be left for families to discuss at home.Opponents, however, have dubbed it the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill, arguing the ban it creates would negatively impact an already marginalized community. They've pointed to data showing that LGBTQ youth reported lower rates of attempting suicide when they had access to LGBTQ-affirming spaces. The bill's opponents have also decried a part of the legislation that allows parents to bring civil suits against a school district for any potential violation of its rules, arguing it would open educators up to an endless barrage of litigation. The legislation has drawn scrutiny from Democrats in the state and elsewhere, including from President Joe Biden, who vowed last month to protect LGBTQ youth from such measures. Read MoreIf signed by DeSantis, a staunch conservative who has a history of supporting anti-LGBTQ measures in the state, the bill would take effect in July. His office declined CNN's request for comment on the Senate's passage Tuesday, instead pointing to remarks he made last week on the legislation. \"To provide protections for parents, for preschoolers, kindergarteners, first graders, I mean that is something, I think, most parents would appreciate,\" DeSantis told reporters. \"And we send the kids to school -- young kids -- and we want them to learn the basics. Some of these issues that are just simply not age-appropriate, I think parents want to see protection for that.\" Bill seeks to limit classroom instructionFlorida students participate in massive walkout to protest the 'Don't Say Gay' billThe bill states that \"classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.\"In addition, the measure would require districts to \"adopt procedures for notifying a student's parent if there is a change in the student's services or monitoring related to the student's mental, emotional, or physical health or well-being,\" something LGBTQ advocates argue could lead to some students being outed to their parents without the student's knowledge or consent. Advocates also fear the bill would restrict students' ability to speak confidentially with school counselors -- some of whom are a student's sole resource for mental health services.More than a dozen attempts by members of the Florida Senate to amend the bill on Monday failed, despite emotional pleas from some Democrats, including state Sen. Shevrin Jones, who brought some senators to tears as he spoke about his experience as a gay Floridian. State Sen. Jeff Brandes, a Republican, offered an amendment that would have broadened the legislation to prohibit all instruction of any sexual topics in an attempt to eliminate concerns from LGTBQ advocates that the bill stigmatized members of the community, but it failed.Brandes, along with one other Republican state senator, joined Democrats in voting against the measure Tuesday. 'There will be protests everywhere'During Monday's debate, the bill's Senate sponsor, Republican state Sen. Dennis Baxley, said that he was concerned that kids are \"experimenting\" with sexual orientation and that was part of his motivation for the legislation. The bill's co-sponsor in the Florida House, Republican state Rep. Joe Harding, previously told CNN that the bill is meant to deter school staff from inquiring about a student's gender identity or pronouns without including their parents in the conversation. Harding had said that he'd heard a few instances of parents complaining that school staff were discussing gender identity with their children without their input, though he didn't get into specifics of where in the state such instances occurred. After \"Saturday Night Live\" poked fun at the bill, Christina Pushaw, the governor's spokeswoman, posted on Twitter that anyone who opposes the bill is \"probably a groomer,\" in essence smearing those who've raised concerns about the bill as sexual predators. Her comments harken back to debunked arguments used by anti-gay activists in recent history to smear and marginalize members of the LGBTQ community. Opponents of the measure have pointed to research from the Trevor Project, a nonprofit organization that works on suicide prevention among LGBTQ youth. The group said in a statement last month that \"LGBTQ youth who had access to spaces that affirmed their sexual orientation and gender identity -- including schools -- reported lower rates of attempting suicide than those who did not.\" Students in Florida have been among some of the bill's loudest opponents, with several high schools across the state having held walkouts in recent days in protest of the bill.\"We wanted to show our government that this isn't going to stop. There were walkouts all last week. This is going to continue. If this passes, there will be protests everywhere,\" Will Larkins, a junior who helped organize a walkout at Winter Park High School in Orange County, told CNN on Monday.This story has been updated with additional background information and reaction.CNN's Jamiel Lynch, Steve Contorno and Caroll Alvarado contributed to this report.",

        "content": "New York (CNN Business)Russia's invasion of Ukraine is unfolding online like no war in history, providing a real-time stream of information on social platforms like Twitter, Facebook and TikTok. But with that unique view into the conflict comes a flood of misinformation that's especially hard to root out \u2014 effectively creating a digital fog of war.In recent weeks, for example, clips from video games and scenes from old wars presented as views from Ukraine's front lines have gone viral alongside legitimate images. Heart-wrenching videos of families torn apart have been shared thousands of times, then debunked. And official government accounts from Ukraine and Russia have each made unfounded or misleading statements, which quickly get amplified online.Fact check: Pro-Russia social media accounts spread false claims that old videos show Ukrainian 'crisis actors' In some ways, it's the latest in a long list of recent crises \u2014 from the pandemic to the Capitol riot \u2014 that have spurred the spread of potentially harmful misinformation. But misinformation experts say there are key differences between the war in Ukraine and other misinformation events that make false claims about the conflict especially insidious and difficult to counter. Perhaps most notably, Ukraine-related misinformation has been highly visual and is spreading faster across borders, misinformation experts told CNN Business. The direct involvement of Russia \u2014 which is known for spreading misinformation online aimed at sowing discord and confusion \u2014 adds an extra layer of complexity. The emotional and visceral nature of the content also makes social media users quick to hit the share button, despite the complex misinformation landscape. \"People feel helpless, they feel like they want to do something and so they're online scrolling and they're sharing things that they think are true because they're trying to be helpful,\" said Claire Wardle, a Brown University professor and US director at misinformation-fighting nonprofit First Draft News. \"[But] in these moments of upheaval and crisis, this is the time that we are worst at figuring out what's true or false.\"Read MoreA 'torrent of images and videos being shared'Unlike the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, when many viral false claims have been text-based, much of the misinformation about the war in Ukraine has been in the form of images and videos. And those visual formats are harder and more time consuming for both automated systems and human fact checkers to evaluate and debunk, to say nothing of everyday social media users.To vet an image or video, fact checkers typically start by searching the web to see if it has been posted previously, indicating that it is not from the current crisis. If it does appear to be recent, they can use tools to do things such as analyze shadows or compare the terrain shown to satellite images to confirm whether it was truly shot in the location it purports to show.\"Obviously, that's going to be much more time consuming,\" said Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez-Echevarr\u00eda, public policy and institutional development coordinator at Spain-based fact checking organization Maldita.es. By comparison, he said, \"plainly false narratives about vaccination, say, like, 'They create autism' ... all that stuff is pretty easy to debunk.\" And while anyone can run a photo through a reverse-image search engine like Google Image Search or TinEye to see where it may have popped up online in the past, it can be a lot harder for people to find tools to verify videos, noted Rene\u00e9 DiResta, technical research manager at Stanford Internet Observatory. You might be able to track down the display thumbnail that shows up with the video, she said, but it's trickier to find an entire video via reverse image search.This difficulty is clear with the deluge of videos moving through apps such as TikTok. These clips include not just misinformation in its original form but videos perpetuating misinformation as users post their own reaction videos.\"I've opened TikTok a few times and the video that pops up is something that is not an accurate presentation of what it claims to be,\" DiResta said. \"Facebook and Twitter have had some rather extensive experience in content moderation during crises; I think TikTok is finding itself having to get up to speed very quickly.\"The visual nature of much of the misinformation spreading about the war in Ukraine makes it especially hard to detect and counter, experts say.The speed with which false claims and narratives are spreading from one country to the next has also increased \u2014 from several weeks in the case of the pandemic and other recent crises to just a matter of days or, in some cases, even hours now, Hern\u00e1ndez-Echevarr\u00eda said. This may be due in part to the fact that so much of the content is visual, and thus less reliant on a shared language. Images and videos also often have a more emotional appeal than text-based posts, which experts say makes users more likely to share them.\"Right now there's this torrent of images and videos being shared,\" said Brandie Nonnecke, director of the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) Policy Lab at UC Berkeley. \"The more the imagery moves you, the quicker it's going to move through social media networks.\"In one recent example, a video purporting to show Ukrainian soldiers saying emotional goodbyes to their families was viewed thousands of times on Instagram and was shared across various Facebook pages. However, AFP Fact Check found that the video was from 2018 and showed US Marines returning home to their families. Instagram and some pages on Facebook have since placed a label on the video warning users that it is \"partly false information,\" but the video is available on at least one other Facebook page without a label. (Facebook-parent Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) Analysis: Russia and QAnon have the same false conspiracy theory about Ukraine Coordinated efforts by Russia to spread false narratives have also become more overt and prominent since the war began. A false claim by Russia that the United States is developing bioweapons in Ukraine and Russian President Vladimir Putin has stepped in to save the day has recently reemerged and gained traction \u2014 first among QAnon adherents and, more recently, on more mainstream platforms and even among some lawmakers. There is also a new, troubling trend of videos that appear to be debunking false, pro-Ukrainian images and videos which are themselves fake and designed to sow confusion and doubt about Russia's actions, ProPublica reported last week. Some on the Ukranian side have spread misleading information. Earlier this month, as Russian forces were firing on Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted that \"if (the plant) blows up, it will be 10 times larger than Chernobyl,\" referencing the largest nuclear power disaster in history. But while experts expressed serious concerns, they also said that the more modern plant was built differently and more safely than Chernobyl, and was unlikely to be at risk of blowing up.  In many cases, false or misleading narratives are spread through mildly conspiratorial videos or images. Each individual piece of content might not be harmful enough to violate platforms' guidelines, but when users watch hundreds of videos a day, they may walk away with a skewed idea of what's happening on the ground, according to Wardle. \"The wider narratives here that are shaping the war, shaping people's ideas of Europe and NATO and Russia, it's less about an individual TikTok video. It's like the drip, drip, drip of what those narratives are doing and the way that they're making people shape their understanding,\" she said.  Platforms fighting back against misinformation Big social media platforms have taken steps to provide users with context around the Ukraine-related content they see. Twitter and Meta-owned platforms Instagram and Facebook, for instance, have begun removing or labeling and demoting content posted by or linking to Russian state-controlled media, including television network Russia Today (Facebook had said in 2020 that it would start labeling state-controlled media). TikTok said earlier this month it would pilot a similar effort to label \"some state-controlled media accounts.\" TikTok also says it prohibits \"harmful misinformation,\" although it's not clear how it defines that phrase. The three platforms also work with independent fact-checking organizations to identify policy-violating, false content or surface accurate information.Twitter and Meta have also said they are working to enforce their policies related to coordinated inauthentic behavior \u2014 which refers to bad actors using networks of fake accounts to spread falsehoods online \u2014 for potential Ukraine-related activity. Meta recently detailed a pro-Russia disinformation network that it removed, which included fake user profiles complete with AI-generated profile pictures and websites posing as independent news outlets to spread anti-Ukraine propaganda.Russia's misinformation offensive impedes diplomatic efforts to end the warSome of these efforts have landed the tech companies in hot water with Russia, resulting in their platforms being restricted or banned in the country and showing the tightrope they must walk as they manage the use of their platforms during the crisis. And the continued rapid spread of misinformation online proves that none of these methods can staunch the flow of falsehoods. Even if a piece of content is labeled on one platform, content is often repurposed on others that may not have equally robust fact-checking practices. When social networks host misinformation, the platforms' algorithms can quickly amplify its reach so it's seen by thousands or millions of users.  There are now some efforts underway to use social media platforms to spread accurate information and teach users how to avoid amplifying falsehoods. The White House held a briefing last week with top TikTok influencers to answer questions about the war in Ukraine and the United States' role in the conflict, according to the Washington Post. And Hern\u00e1ndez-Echevarr\u00eda's Maldita.es has worked with with more than 60 other fact-checking organizations from around the world to create a database of debunked misinformation related to the war, which can be used by social media platforms and users. In order to cut down on the spread of misinformation online \u2014 and in light of constantly changing rules at social media platforms \u2014 Nonnecke would like to see a set of standards or best practices that these platforms must engage in during times of war, enforced by an outside group. \"They shouldn't just be deciding on a whim what they want to do,\" she said.Major social media platforms must also boost their content moderation capabilities in languages other than English \u2014 in this case, especially in Eastern European languages such as Polish, Romanian and Slovenian, Wardle said. \"My friend who's from Romania, she's like, 'This whole narrative around Putin coming to save Ukrainians from the Nazis, in the West you're all kind of laughing at it,'\" she said, referencing the Russian President's claims without evidence that the Ukranian government is a \"gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis\". \"But she's like, 'Here, it's everywhere.'\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, sending troops into the ex-Soviet nation from three fronts and firing missiles on several locations near the capital, Kyiv, in a broad attack that has drawn deep condemnation from world leaders. At dawn, troops and armor crossed into eastern Ukraine from the Russian border, as well as from Belarus in the north and from Russia-annexed Crimea to the south.Here's how it unfolded.Stirrings in Crimea3:59 a.m. (8:59 p.m. ET, Wednesday): Livestream video from a border crossing station between Crimea -- which was annexed by Russia in 2014 -- and parts of southern Ukraine viewed by CNN showed what may have been the first signs of the Russian invasion. Read MoreIn the video, a guard at the Kalanchak crossing is seen reacting to something heading towards the Ukrainian border. The guard begins moving back towards the gate, and soon another guard comes into frame.   About 25 seconds later, people who had just walked across to Crimea, are seen -- suitcases in tow -- running back across the border. The lights suddenly go out at the station, and the camera switches to black and white, recording in infrared.4:08 a.m.: An individual dressed in camouflage is seen carrying a flashlight coming around one of the border guard stations. Three minutes later, three more individuals in camouflage are seen walking around the border crossing. Minutes later, the the camera cuts out. Very soon after, another webcam at the Chongar border crossing -- the only other active border crossing station from Crimea -- shows lights suddenly turning off, and, minutes later, the camera turns off as well.Putin announces 'operation'4:50 a.m.: Russian President Vladimir Putin made a speech, saying he had decided \"to conduct a special military operation ... to protect people who have been subjected to abuse and genocide by the Kyiv regime for eight years,\" repeating a baseless claim about Ukraine's Russian-separatist-backed Donbas region.He denied, however, that Russia was planning to occupy Ukrainian territories. \"We are not going to impose anything on anyone by force.\"Russian President Vladimir Putin's speech was broadcast minutes before the bombardment began. He went on to warn: \"Whoever tries to interfere with us, and even more so, to create threats for our country, for our people should know that Russia's response will be immediate and will lead you to such consequences that you have never experienced in your history.\"Strikes begin5.07 a.m.: Russian forces launched a series of missile attacks against locations near Kyiv, as well as the use of long-range artillery against the northeastern city of Kharkiv, near the Russian border.  Before daylight: The strikes quickly spread across central and eastern Ukraine, as Russian forces attacked the country from three sides. People in the cities of Odessa, Dnipro, Mariupol and Kramatorsk reported huge blasts.Several detonations to the east of Kyiv let off massive plumes of gray smoke rising into the night sky. One of the chief targets was the main international airport at Boryspil, which is pummeled by missiles. Video showed a cruise missile hitting a military installation at the airport at Ivano-Frankivsk in western Ukraine. Airports were also hit in Kharkiv, Ozerne, Kulbakino, Chuhuiv, Kramatorsk and Chornobaivka. Most of the targets were military bases, but there was clearly substantial damage in and around several cities. In Kharkiv, video emerged of an apartment block that had been damaged by a missile or long-range artillery. Another video showed a rocket embedded in a road. The State Emergency Service reported that six people were trapped in rubble in Nizhyn. A convoy of Russian military vehicles is seen moving towards the border in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine on February 23.Police officers inspect the remains of a missile that landed in a street in Kyiv on February 24.Ukraine's interior ministry said ballistic missiles had been used as part of the offensive, while jets were heard over the central city of Zaporizhzhye.The Russians used a wide array of weaponry in their assault, including attack aircraft and helicopters, tanks, long range artillery and missiles.6.48 a.m.: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky responded to Putin with a minute-long speech of his own, saying he had spoken to US President Joe Biden and that the US was rallying international support for Ukraine.\"The West is with us,\" he said, and announced martial law across the country.At the same time, a livestream video seen by CNN showed troops atop a column of military vehicles entering Ukraine from a border crossing with Belarus. The livestream video was taken at the Senkivka, Urkaine crossing with Veselovka, Belarus. Dawn breaks7 a.m.: After dawn, air raid sirens sounded across Kyiv and at around 7:45 a.m., sirens go off in the western city of Lviv. A short time later, a single, unidentifiable plane roared above the capital. Inhabitants of Kyiv leave the city following the Russian offensive of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. 8.00 a.m.: Ukraine claimed it had shot down five Russian aircraft and a helicopter. Russia denied losing any aircraft.As the day began in Kyiv, streams of vehicles could be seen crossing the North Bridge, heading west, away from the focus of the Russian assault. Other people in the capital sought shelter in subway stations.Across the country, long lines formed at gas stations and cash machines. A few people gathered in the streets of Kharkiv to pray.An eyewitness who saw and heard the latest strike in the town of Brovary on the outskirts of Kyiv described the situation as \"terrifying.\"11.28 a.m: Ukrainian leader Zelensky made a televised address, in which he said Russia has attacked Ukraine in a \"cunning way,\" comparing him to Hitler in World War II.He called on \"everyone who is able\" to join the military and called on veterans to come forward.\"From today our countries are on opposing sides of world history. Russia is on the side of evil, but it depends on the Russian people,\" he said.\"The people of Russia will have to choose which path each of them takes. Everyone in Russia who has not lost their honor, they have time to come out and protest this war.\"12:37 p.m.: More than 40 soldiers and about 10 civilians had been killed, Ukrainian authorities said.12:45 p.m.: CNN teams in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odessa and Mariupol heard more strikes, though they appear to be less severe than explosions reported earlier. 12:55 p.m.: Around five blasts were heard by a CNN team in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. Around 2 p.m.: A K-52 \"Alligator\" Russian helicopter was shot down in the Kyiv region, near Mezhyhirya, the Ukrainian Interior Ministry confirmed. All timings are in local Ukrainian time and are estimates. CNN teams across Ukraine and Russia contributed to this report.",

Beijing's diplomatic and military ties with Moscow may be strong, but its economic allegiances are a lot more complex. As relations deteriorate with the West, Putin and Xi are getting closerRussian President Vladimir Putin met his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Friday as the Beijing Winter Olympics kicked off. The Kremlin described the meeting as warm and constructive, and the leaders agreed to deepen their cooperation, according to an account published by Chinese state news agency Xinhua. Russian oil giant Rosneft said it had agreed to boost supplies to China over the next decade.\"Working together, we can achieve stable economic growth ... and stand together against today's risks and challenges,\" Putin wrote in an op-ed published Thursday by Xinhua.Those risks may be formidable should Russia invade Ukraine. Moscow has denied that it has any intention of doing so.Read MoreBut US lawmakers are threatening to impose what they call the \"mother of all sanctions\" on Russia should it cross a red line. European leaders are also preparing punishments that would go way beyond the curbs imposed on Russia when it annexed Crimea in 2014.China \u2014 which has its own tensions with the West \u2014 has already expressed diplomatic support for its ally. In a joint statement issued Friday after their meeting, Xi and Putin said both sides opposed \"further enlargement of NATO.\" Russia fears Ukraine may join the alliance.\"Xi almost certainly believes there is a strategic interest in supporting Russia,\" said Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the DC-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies. He pointed out that China \"remains at permanent loggerheads\" with the United States. There is already some evidence that tensions with the West have deepened cooperation between China and Russia, according to Alexander Gabuev, senior fellow and chair of Russia in the Asia\u2011Pacific Program at Carnegie Moscow Center. He cited arms deals, the joint development of weapons, and an \"increased number of joint drills\" between the two powers. But it's not clear how far that would extend to deeper economic cooperation in the face of harsh sanctions. Russia depends deeply on China for trade, but that's not the case the other way round. And the Chinese economy is already in a shaky spot, giving less incentive to Xi to tie his country's fortunes to Moscow's in the event of a military crisis. \"It would be a 'win' for Putin if Xi simply hews closely to China's stated desire for a diplomatic resolution to the crisis, as it implies that Putin's grievances are legitimate,\" Singleton said. \"Beyond that though, China may be hard pressed to truly deepen its economic ties with Russia, at least any time soon.\"Russia's President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping pose during a meeting in Beijing on Friday.Russia needs China for trade. China has other prioritiesChina is Russia's No. 1 trading partner, accounting for 16% of the value of its foreign trade, according to CNN Business calculations based on 2020 figures from the World Trade Organization and Chinese customs data. But for China, Russia matters a lot less: Trade between the two countries made up just 2% of China's total trade volume. The European Union and the United States have much larger shares. \"Beijing needs to be very cautious about wading into a conflict between NATO and Russia over the Ukraine,\" said Alex Capri, a research fellow at the Hinrich Foundation. \"China's current economic ties with Russia, including its energy needs, don't warrant Beijing risking further alienation and backlash from Washington and its allies. This could come back to haunt Beijing later.\"Western authorities know the stakes are high for China, too. Last month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Beijing that an invasion of Ukraine would create \"global security and economic risks\" that could also hurt China.China's economy expanded 8.1% in 2021, but growth is slowingChina's economy is already struggling, which could make it harder for Beijing to deepen ties with Moscow \u2014 or even deliver on promises it has already made, such as a recent agreement to boost China-Russia trade to $200 billion by 2024, roughly $50 billion a year more than it does now.The International Monetary Fund expects China's economy to grow by just 4.8% this year, down from 8% in 2021. A real estate crisis and subdued consumer spending are dragging the rate of growth down.Singleton said that an escalating crisis in Ukraine would \"almost certainly shock\" energy and metals markets, thus weighing heavily on the global economy. That kind of emergency, coupled with China's strict zero-Covid policy, \"could hasten China's already rapid economic slowdown.\"There are limits to Beijing's helpA strong relationship with China would likely only mitigate rather than neutralize the impact of Western sanctions on Russia, according to Capri of the Hinrich Foundation.And there are some problems that China can't really help with at all, he added. Take the \"nuclear option\" that could upend the Russian economy, for example. The West could remove the country from SWIFT, a high security network that connects thousands of financial institutions around the world. That could cut Russia off from the global banking system.What is SWIFT and why it might be the weapon Russia fears mostThe Chinese yuan is \"nowhere close to being sufficiently internationalized to compete with the US dollar,\" Capri said, noting that the dollar plays a critical role in both SWIFT and also the trading of commodities such as oil and gas, the \"lifeblood of Russia's economy.\"Analysts at Eurasia Group wrote in a report last week that Beijing could redouble efforts to build a yuan-denominated payment system, which might allow it to do business more freely with countries that have been sanctioned by the West without using dollars or euros. Even so, they wrote, companies in both China and Russia \"still prefer to denominate trade in freely convertible currencies,\" meaning that any efforts to reduce Western influence would be \"more aspirational than substantive.\" Recent history isn't in Russia's favor. After Russia invaded and annexed Crimea in 2014, the country pivoted to China for support as it was slapped with economic sanctions. And even though Beijing publicly opposed those punishments and promised to boost economic ties, its efforts weren't enough to offset Russia's problems. Trade between Russia and China in 2015 fell 29% from the year before, according to official statistics from China. Chinese direct investment into Russia also suffered.And Russian bankers complained that Chinese banks were reluctant to do business with them so as to avoid violating the sanctions, according to a 2015 op-ed written by Yuri Soloviev, the deputy president of VTB Bank, a major Russian financial institution.\"China is the senior partner in the bilateral relationship,\" wrote the Eurasia Group analysts in their recent report, pointing out that the economy is about nine times larger than Russia's. \"It is likely that Beijing wants to shape Moscow's calculus to its advantage.\"",

        "content": "New York (CNN Business)Coca-Cola is turning another one of its drinks into an alcoholic alternative. It's the company's third boozy beverage as it taps into the growing canned cocktail craze.In a partnership between Molson Coors (TAP) and Coke, the companies are launching Simply Spiked Lemonade, an alcoholic drink inspired by the Simply brand's fruit juice. Flavors include strawberry lemonade, watermelon lemonade, blueberry lemonade and regular lemonade. The alcohol will be derived from fermented sugar cane. Molson's Chief Marketing Officer Michelle St. Jacques said there was a \"big opportunity\" for Simply because it's a \"powerful and beloved\" product. \"Simply is known for its bold flavor and real fruit juice and there's a great opportunity to create a new brand (in the alcohol aisle),\" she told CNN Business in an exclusive interview. Simply Spiked Lemonade is coming this summer.Simply Spiked Lemonade will be sold in a variety of 12-pack of slim cans, which has 5% alcohol-by-volume, and 24-ounce standalone cans. Prices weren't yet released, but it will go on sale this summer. Despite consumers shifting away from sugary drinks and juices, Molson is optimistic about the new product's success because consumers are looking for bold flavors in the alcohol category. Read MoreSimply is Coke's second-biggest brand in the US, generating $1 billion in revenue, St. Jacques said. Coke credited the \"solid performance\" of Simply in its annual report, despite its juice, dairy and plant-based beverages unit declining 9% last year. Slowing juice sales prompted Pepsi to offload its Tropicana brand to a private equity firm in a multibillion dollar deal last year.Simply Spiked Lemonade joins Coke's growing roster of alcoholic drinks leveraging its popular brands and looking for areas of growth. It recently revealed Fresca Mixed, a spirit-based cocktail, that will be released this summer in conjunction with Corona-maker Constellation (STZB). In 2020, Molson and Coke started selling Topo Chico hard seltzer and added a new tequila-based flavor, called Ranch Water, this year. Ready-to-drink cocktail sales have exploded as drinkers look for convenience and new flavors beyond wine and beer. The beverage category grew 53% last year and is projected to grow another 29% over the next three years, according to data from IWSR Drinks Analysis. The craze is overshadowing spiked seltzers. Following strong sales over the past few years, the low-calorie drinks have faded in popularity \u2014 and sales \u2014 as customers get bored with them. For Molson, sales of its hard seltzer brands have been performing well, but the company quietly discontinued Coors Seltzer last year to focus on its Topo Chico and Vizzy brands.Coke rival PepsiCo (PEP) announced its entry into the alcohol market last year with \"HARD MTN DEW,\" a sugar-free canned beverage with 5% alcohol by volume that is being created with the Boston Beer Company (SAM).",

        "content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN's Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country's rise and how it impacts the world. Sign up here.Hong Kong (CNN Business)China was hoping the Winter Olympics would be a watershed moment for the digital yuan, providing a global stage on which to parade its prowess in financial innovation.Instead, geopolitical tensions, the pandemic and China's insistence on stamping out every trace of Covid are spoiling the party, dealing a blow to one of the most ambitious digital currency projects on the planet.China is already on the verge of becoming a cashless society, but the vast majority of those electronic transactions happen on privately owned apps, outside of the immediate purview of the state. An official yuan would change that, giving Beijing an unprecedented amount of information about what people are spending their money on and where. The world's second largest economy has been trialing the digital yuan in Chinese cities for the last two years, as it prepares for a national rollout that could put China ahead of Europe and the United States in the global race to develop a state-backed digital currency.The timeline for that nationwide launch has yet to be decided, but Beijing almost certainly intended the Olympic Games to be an important milestone on the road to widespread usage.Read MoreChina wants to weaponize its currency. A digital version could helpBeijing has been pressuring businesses \u2014 including big Western companies such as McDonald's (MCD) and Nike (NKE) \u2014 to allow customers to use the digital yuan during the games. The digital version of the currency is one of only three payment choices foreign athletes and others have at sporting venues and the Olympic Village, aside from cash and Visa payments. And last year, Beijing said it would make it easier for foreigners to use the digital yuan during the Games by giving athletes ski gloves and smart watches with built-in payment functions, and scrapping a requirement to open a local bank account if they wished to use the currency.As the event approaches, though, those efforts may land with a thud. Beijing is barring most fans from attending the Games, and has constructed an elaborate quarantine \"bubble\" to separate Olympians, officials, journalists and support staff from the rest of the city as fears of coronavirus outbreaks persist. Western lawmakers are also warning their athletes against using the digital yuan over mistrust of the Chinese government, including spying concerns.\"The Olympic Games would have been the first real chance for tourists and Chinese nationals alike to familiarize themselves with the digital yuan, but that door slammed shut when the Chinese government decided to severely restrict the number of Olympic spectators,\" said Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a DC-based research institute.\"That decision alone, more than anything else, will likely further delay the mass adoption of the digital currency.\"The digital yuan is one of only three payment choices foreign athletes and others have at sporting venues and the Olympic Village, aside from cash and Visa payments. A muted international debutChinese companies and government officials have been touting the Games as an opportunity for the digital yuan in recent weeks, even as it has become obvious that attendance will be minimal.\"Launching the digital yuan at a big party like the Winter Olympics can showcase China's latest fintech achievement to the world,\" Li Xin, chief business manager at Bank of China's (BACHF) digital yuan unit, told the state broadcaster earlier this month. The state-owned bank is the official banking partner of the Beijing Games.Several factors are making widespread adoption difficult. Authorities have created one of the most complex Covid quarantines ever attempted. Known officially as the \"closed loop system,\" the restrictions will apply to some 11,000 people from around the world, sealing them off from the wider Chinese population.Anyone \u2014 Chinese or foreign visitor \u2014 who isn't part of that system are barred from attending the Games at all, further limiting the scale of the spectacle. 'It creates a lot of anxiety': Ahead of the Winter Olympics, athletes are doing everything to avoid catching Covid-19Political tensions could also complicate the situation. Last July, three US Republican Senators urged the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee to forbid American athletes from \"receiving or using the digital yuan during the Beijing Olympics.\" The committee didn't publicly respond. But it has reportedly advised US athletes to bring disposable or burner phones to the Olympics in China because of possible surveillance, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month. Several other countries, including the United Kingdom and Canada, have offered similar advice to their athletes, according to Reuters.Even if many of the people who do attend the event use the digital yuan, \"it won't make a significant dent in overall transaction levels,\" said Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.The digital yuan is available in 10 cities and regions, but experts cite a lack of incentives as a major reason for flagging enthusiasm.Struggling for traction The digital yuan is already struggling to gain traction within China. Transactions using the currency totaled just $8.37 billion in the second half of 2021, equivalent to $1.4 billion per month. While that marks some progress following two years of trials, it's still far from mounting a serious challenge to privately owned digital payment apps.Ant Group, for example, revealed in 2020 stock exchange filings that its Alipay app processed $1.6 trillion on average each month \u2014 more than a thousand times the digital yuan's monthly transaction volume.After initially limiting usage of digital yuan wallets to winners of a lucky draw, the Chinese government has been making it easier for the public to try the virtual money. At the start of this year, for example, the People's Bank of China released a wallet app on Apple and Android stores that can be used in 10 cities and regions that are piloting the currency, along with the Olympic venues. That pilot app is now available to everyone in those areas, not just the lottery winners.Central bank digital currencies are coming. The US must be preparedThe central bank has touted surging numbers among its trial users last year as a sign of the digital yuan's success. By the end of December, the app had been downloaded by 261 million individuals, or 19% of China's population, according to central bank data.But there are still barriers to use the money, too. Outside of the Olympics exemption for foreigners, people who want to trade with digital yuan need to download and sign up for the central bank app, and then add money from their accounts at one of the designated Chinese banks. The currency also can't be used outside of the 10 cities and regions that are piloting it, along with the participating Olympics venues.Consumers appear to have an \"unwillingness to embrace\" the currency right now, according to Frank Xie, a professor at University of South Carolina Aiken who studies Chinese business and the economy.Experts cited a lack of incentives as a major reason for the lack of enthusiasm. \"The ecosystems that have been built now for a decade around the big tech firms are unbeatable in terms of network and convenience,\" said Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow focusing on Chinese financial innovation and technology at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. After all, industry leaders Alipay and WeChat Pay already have hundreds of millions of users who are familiar with their services.\"The payment experience does not tend to strike most users as any different or better than what is already on offer,\" he added.Xie also suspected that concerns about a loss of privacy could be a factor, adding that \"even ordinary citizens\" have come to realize the reach of the government's power. Changing spending patternsThe government does have some options for pushing consumers to change their spending patterns, according to Singleton of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\"Overtime, it is possible people could see increased adoption of the digital yuan to pay for certain expenses, like utility bills, transportation or other government-managed bills, simply because the government could force those changes upon consumers,\" he said.Analysts have also raised the possibility that the government could request that privately owned apps actively promote the state-backed yuan. That's already starting to happen: Alipay began trialing digital yuan payments last year, and Tencent said earlier this month that it would also start supporting the digital yuan in its WeChat Pay wallet.\"In effect, you are asking these providers to potentially cannibalize their own systems by allowing customers to use the digital yuan instead of their own existing payment options,\" said Kimmo Soram\u00e4ki, founder and CEO of London-based analytics firm Financial Network Analytics.Ant Group cut down to size in latest blow for Jack Ma's business empire Those companies might feel as if they have little option, though. China's push into digital currency dovetails with its regulatory crackdown on Big Tech. Ant Group and Tencent (TCEHY) have been under intense scrutiny, and were forced to either overhaul their businesses or pay big fines as Beijing sought to curb their power. \"The rollout of future versions of AliPay and WeChatPay [is] likely to be forestalled, which in turn will limit the power wielded by these major tech firms,\" said Singleton, who added that the government is hoping that its regulatory hurdles will allow the digital yuan to \"overtake these other payment systems.\"However, Beijing eventually secures wider adoption of its state-backed digital currency, there does appear to at least be one certainty: The Beijing Winter Olympics isn't shaping up to be the stage for digital yuan bragging rights that authorities might have hoped for.",

        "content": "New Delhi (CNN)India's vaccine rollout on Saturday widened to everyone age 18 and above -- yet a number of states are warning they have no shots to give. With hospitals running out of space and India's authorities reporting more than 300,000 coronavirus cases each day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced last month that he would extend the vaccine rollout beyond health care workers and the country's most vulnerable in a bid to tackle India's spiraling Covid crisis. So far, just over 2% of India's 1.3 billion people have been fully immunized with one of two vaccines -- significantly lower than the United States, where 29.8% of the population are fully immunized. India is one of the world's top 10 buyers of Covid vaccines. It still has nowhere near enoughAlmost 13.3 million people applied for vaccinations on the first day of registrations opening, according to the government's dedicated website, CoWIN. But ahead of the expanded rollout, multiple states have said they are short on supply. CNN has confirmed at least seven states or union territories where Saturday's rollout is being impacted by vaccine shortages. Although some are run by opposition party governments, they also include Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, both populous states run by Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party.Read MoreDuring a press conference Friday, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal urged citizens not to queue up for shots as the union territory, which includes the Indian capital New Delhi, has not received vaccine supplies yet. \"As soon as the vaccines come, we will make proper announcements. Only then people with appointments can start coming to the centers,\" he said. Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, from the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, said another 25 million doses had been ordered to meet the rollout -- but those vaccines wouldn't arrive in time. \"Therefore, the over-18s vaccination program will not begin in Madhya Pradesh from May 1,\" he said. The western state of Gujarat is also pushing its expanded rollout to May 15, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani announced. Vaccination for those age 18 and above \"will begin once we get substantial doses of vaccines from the pharma companies, which is likely to happen soon,\" Rupani said in a virtual address posted on social media.And in Andhra Pradesh state, the chief minister said Thursday the expanded rollout might not start until September, according to CNN affiliate CNN-News18.Other states have made no mention of shifting the rollout date, even as their health authorities warn of shortages. Maharashtra, the worst-hit state, has made repeated appeals for more vaccines, with its capital Mumbai suspending all vaccinations across the city due to shortages on Thursday.People wait in a queue to get vaccinated against Covid-19 on April 27, 2021 in Mumbai, India.Vaccination difficultiesIndia started the year with an ambitious goal: to fully vaccinate 300 million people by August.The vaccination program began in mid-January, but the rollout has been riddled with problems. It had a slow start, with logistical issues as well as vaccine hesitancy among the population -- especially towards India's homegrown Covaxin vaccine, which was approved for emergency use before the efficacy data of its third phase trial was released.Public confidence slowly rose and the rate of vaccination picked up -- but then the second wave hit. With demand skyrocketing, supplies quickly dwindled.There are several contributing factors to the ongoing shortages. For one, India rapidly exported a large number of vaccine doses to other countries and through COVAX, the global initiative to provide vaccines to low-income countries. To date, India has exported 66 million vaccines. A health worker administers a shot of Covid-19 vaccine on April 29, 2021 in New Delhi, India. There is also a shortage of materials, with the United States prioritizing raw vaccine materials for its own domestic rollout -- though the Biden administration has since said it intends to send vaccines to India.The Indian government has scrambled to catch up, with increasing urgency as the second wave accelerate. To date, the government has purchased at least 205.5 million doses of vaccines, according to data from the Duke Global Health Innovation Center -- placing India in the top 10 vaccine buyers in the world. On Thursday, the country's health ministry announced more than 10 million vaccines were in storage with states across India, and 2 million more would be distributed within the next three days. But the delays and shortages have sparked frustration among some local authorities, who say the central government has been too slow and disorganized in its response to the crisis.A medical worker prepares a jab of the Covaxin Covid-19 coronavirus vaccine at a health centre in New Delhi on April 29, 2021. All through April, vaccination centers in various states complained of vaccine delays and shortages, with dozens forced to temporarily close. In the state of Maharashtra, volunteer teams and health workers went door to door, bringing eligible people to get inoculated -- only to be turned away at the vaccination site because there were no more shots left.States urged the central government to send more vaccines. But the government has pushed back, claiming any shortages were due to the states' own mismanagement or inaccurate reporting. As frustrations grow between local, state and federal authorities, patience has long run out on the ground, where the health care system is collapsing and thousands are dying each day. Securing a steady vaccine supply with smoother nationwide distribution may be crucial to minimize the damage as the second wave sweeps the country, experts say. \"The only solution for India is to vaccinate itself out of this pandemic,\" said Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy in New Delhi. \"And the world really needs to help, because if India doesn't fix this problem, the world is not done with Covid.\"CNN's Jessie Yeung reported and wrote from Hong Kong.

        "content": "(CNN)When Uddhab Gautam got his first vaccine dose back in February, Covid-19 cases in Nepal were low.Now, three months later, coronavirus infections in the Himalayan nation have spiraled out of control, leading to a shortage of hospital beds and oxygen, and sending most of the country into lockdown. But despite needing it more than ever, the 67-year-old retired banker has no idea when he'll get his second dose of Covishield, the AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII).\"As an older person, I'm afraid of contracting the virus,\" he said from his home in Nepal's capital Kathmandu. \"I have chosen to stay indoors.\"Gautam's predicament is similar to one shared by millions worldwide: as India's own coronavirus crisis has spiraled, SII -- world's largest vaccine maker -- can no longer export its goods.Nepal army personnel wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) load the body of a person who died from Covid-19 coronavirus before taking it to a crematorium in Kathmandu on May 5, 2021. Read MoreLast week, the SII said it wouldn't restart deliveries to COVAX, a worldwide initiative aimed at distributing vaccines to countries regardless of wealth, until the end of this year. While SII's decision will be a lifeline for India, which is still reporting about 200,000 new cases a day, the delay poses a huge problem for developing countries that depend on COVAX to control large outbreaks of their own. The world is already 140 million doses short -- and by the end of June, that gap will have reached 190 million shots, the United Nations children's agency, one of the partners in COVAX, said last week. There is currently no timeframe for resolving the shortage, UNICEF said.  That creates a very real problem, not just for countries with limited access to vaccines where cases are exploding, but also for the whole world.\"We are concerned that the deadly spike in India is a precursor to what will happen if those warnings remain unheeded,\" UNICEF executive director Henrietta Fore said in a news release last week. \"The cost for children and families will be incalculable.\"Why there are COVAX shortfallsLast year, the SII -- which manufactures Covishield, the name given to the AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured in India -- promised to deliver 200 million vaccines to COVAX.More than 111 million of those doses were set to be delivered between February and May this year, mainly to countries in Africa and Asia-Pacific, according to data from Gavi, a public-private global health partnership that is co-leading COVAX.  But as of Tuesday, only about 30 million SII doses had been distributed via COVAX, according to Gavi.

COVAX should have already delivered 170 million total doses, UNICEF said. Instead, as of Tuesday, it has delivered 71 million shots to 125 countries and territories, with about 42% coming from SII, and 56% from AstraZeneca, according to Gavi data. SII began distributing vaccines overseas at the start of the year when India's cases had fallen, and other countries were in \"desperate need of help,\" the company's CEO Adar Poonawalla explained in a statement last week.But as India's cases rose, SII kept supplies at home where there was a growing need. The government denied media reports it had banned vaccine exports.Countries in Africa fear they could become the next India as vaccine supplies dwindleThe World Health Organization (WHO) warned in March that SII doses would be delayed. By that point it had delivered just 28 million shots. As India's caseload started spiking, demand for vaccination grew, and a number of states reported a shortage of shots. That prompted questions about why India -- the world leader in vaccine manufacturing -- was running out of doses. As of Tuesday, just 3% of India's population had been fully vaccinated. SII said last week it had delivered more than 200 million doses in total.\"We continue to scale up manufacturing and prioritize India. We also hope to start delivering to COVAX and other countries by end of this year,\" Poonwalla said. Poonwalla said SII had never exported vaccines \"at the cost of the people in India\" and would \"remain committed to do everything we can in support of the vaccination drive in the country.\" \"We have been working with the government tirelessly to do our best for humanity and will continue in the same spirit,\" he said. A Gavi spokesperson said in a statement that it was in close contact with both SII and the Indian government, and hoped deliveries could resume in a reduced capacity in the third quarter of this year. What this means for developing countriesAcross the border in Nepal, where coronavirus cases and deaths are soaring, SII's announcement has left authorities scrambling. Nepal has only fully vaccinated 1.9% of its population and has almost run out of vaccines.The country has reported more than 500,000 Covid-19 cases and 6,700 deaths. But Nepal has the third highest test positivity rate in the world -- about 40% of tests come back positive -- suggesting it is not catching all cases. The spokesperson for the Ministry of Health and Population, Dr. Jageshwor Gautam, said last week the country only has about 50,000 to 60,000 doses of SII's Covishield in storage for \"emergency purposes.\" Nepal's Health Minister Hridayesh Tripathi said last week that authorities planned to use them in a few days to give elderly people their second dose. A health worker receives a dose of Covishield, AstraZeneca-Oxford's Covid-19 coronavirus vaccine made by Serum Institute of India, at Patan Hospital near Kathmandu on January 27, 2021. The country was hoping to receive 1 million more vaccines by the end of April, but they never arrived. In total, Nepal only received 348,000 doses of its allocated 1.9 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine through COVAX. According to Tripathi, COVAX initially promised 14.8 million doses -- enough for about a quarter of the country's population. Millions of Nepalis have received no dose at all, and 1.5 million people -- most of them 65 or older -- have received one dose of the vaccine, but haven't yet received their second, prompting concerns about how long their immunity will last. \"I haven't heard anything since the first dose,\" said Durga Kaumari Paudel, 66, a housewife who lives with her husband and son in Kathmandu. One of her neighbors died this month from Covid-19, which only adds to her concern -- she has been so afraid she hasn't stepped outside her house in a month. It's unclear whether delaying the timing of second dose will decrease efficacy, but trials show two doses of a vaccine is likely to be better than one, according to Gavi. Nepal's cases skyrocket, prompting concern the country's outbreak could mimic India'sHealth Minister Tripathi said Nepal is in talks with a number of countries in a bid to get the vaccines it needs. He said he's talked to officials from the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries about the AstraZeneca vaccine, and sent letters to the health ministers of the US, UK, China and Russia Wednesday updating them about Nepal's needs. \"We'll get the vaccines we need soon. We are quite confident,\" he said. Nepal isn't alone. Bangladesh was set to receive more than 10 million Covishield doses by the end of May, according to Gavi's allocations. But it's unclear if those ever arrived -- and Bangladesh has now run out of vaccines, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).The country has fully vaccinated just 2.4% of its 164 million population, and cases appear to be rising again. After a request from Bangladesh, China gifted another 600,000 vaccine doses, the Chinese Embassy in Dhaka said in a statement Friday.Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka and Cambodia were also expecting Covishield deliveries, and are all now experiencing spikes in cases. According to IFRC, a \"majority\" of countries in Asia were struggling with vaccine shortages. \"Asia is now the epicenter of this global pandemic,\" said Alexander Matheou, IRFC's Asia-Pacific director. \"Tens of thousands of lives are being lost each week and vaccines must be available so that we can prevent further terrible tolls in the weeks and months ahead.\" What this means for the worldA hamstrung COVAX isn't just a problem for countries in Asia -- it has potentially worldwide ramifications.\"We have issued repeated warnings of the risks of letting down our guard and leaving low- and middle-income countries without equitable access to vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics,\" UNICEF's Fore said in a statement. \"The longer the virus continues to spread unchecked, the higher the risk of more deadly or contagious variants emerging.\"This month, COVAX-co leader Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) set up a COVAX manufacturing task force to tackle vaccine supply challenges, such as a shortage of raw materials.This is what vaccine inequity looks likeThe Gavi spokesperson said one of its top priorities currently was to work with governments with the largest supplies to deliver vaccines through Covax to countries where they could have \"an immediate impact in addressing this short-term supply disruption.\" They did not specify which countries this included.But, as Fore points out, SII isn't the only group that can help solve the vaccine shortage. Only WHO-approved vaccines can be rolled out via COVAX. Earlier this month, WHO listed China's Sinopharm for emergency use, making it the sixth vaccine to be given the green light to be used as part of COVAX. Gavi said earlier this month it was in talks with manufacturers, including Sinopharm, to get more COVAX doses, Reuters reported. While some countries are desperate for vaccines, others are inoculating the less vulnerable, such as young people, a situation that Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, described last week as \"vaccine apartheid.\"  In his opening remarks at the World Health Assembly Monday, he noted that more than 75% of all vaccines have been administered in just 10 countries.\"The ongoing vaccine crisis is a scandalous inequity that is perpetuating the pandemic,\" he said. \"The number of doses administered globally so far would have been enough to cover all health workers and older people, if they had been distributed equitably. We could have been in a much better situation.\"UNICEF said in an email that it was urging countries with excess doses to share them as an immediate stop-gap measure. IFRC is also calling for states and pharmaceutical companies to move faster in distributing vaccines.\"We cannot afford to become bogged down in negotiations over the next six months,\" IFRC president Francesco Rocca said, adding that government needed to share stocks, particularly with countries experiencing Covid-19 surges.Tedros called on manufacturers to give COVAX the first right of refusal on new vaccines, or commit 50% of vaccines to COVAX this year. \"There is no diplomatic way to say it,\" he added. \"A small group of countries that make and buy the majority of the world's vaccines control the fate of the rest of the world.\"CNN's Julia Hollingsworth wrote and reported from Hong Kong.

        "content": "(CNN)In India, the world's biggest vaccine producer, millions of people are waiting for Covid-19 vaccines amid a devastating second wave of infections.India typically produces more than 60% of all vaccines sold globally, and is home to the Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's largest vaccine maker. Its vast manufacturing capability is why the country signed on as a major player in COVAX, the global vaccine-sharing initiative that provides discounted or free doses for lower-income countries. Under the initial agreement announced last year, SII would manufacture up to 200 million doses for up to 92 countries.But the situation in India is markedly different from just a few months ago. Its second wave began in March, quickly surpassing the first, which had peaked last September at more than 97,000 coronavirus cases a day. India reports new record of 103,558 daily Covid cases, as second wave and new lockdowns hitOn Sunday, the country reported 261,500 new cases -- its highest single-day figure so far, according to data from the Indian Ministry of Health. India added a million new cases in less than a week, surpassing 14 million total cases on Thursday.States and cities are imposing new restrictions, including weekend and nighttime curfews in the capital region Delhi, home to 19 million people. Migrant workers are also leaving major cities en masse for their home villages, afraid any potential lockdowns will leave them stranded.Read MoreAnd through it all, vaccine supplies have dried up on the ground, with at least five states reporting severe shortages and urging the federal government to act.In the face of crisis, the government and SII have shifted focus from supplying vaccines to COVAX to prioritizing their own citizens at home.\"Deliveries of doses from the Serum Institute of India will be delayed in March and April,\" said COVAX, which is run by a coalition including international vaccine organization Gavi and the World Health Organization, in a news release on March 25. \"Delays in securing supplies of SII-produced Covid-19 vaccine doses are due to the increased demand for Covid-19 vaccines in India.\"Boxes of the AstraZeneca vaccine, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and provided through the COVAX global initiative, arrive in Mogadishu, Somalia on March 15.India had provided 28 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine so far, and was scheduled to deliver another 40 million doses in March and 50 million in April, the release said, adding that COVAX and the Indian government \"remain in discussions\" about completing supplies.It's not the first time India had to pause its COVAX contributions: in January, the government restricted the export of AstraZeneca vaccines produced by SII \"because they want to prioritize for the most vulnerable and needy segments first,\" SII CEO Adar Poonawalla. But these repeated delays have hit poor countries hard. The director of Africa's disease control body warned India's hold on exports could be \"catastrophic\" for the continent -- while Pakistan, one of the biggest program recipients, decided to allow private vaccine imports and sales to fill the gap. Vaccination centers turning people awayIndia is administering two vaccines domestically: the Oxford-AstraZeneca one, also known as Covishield, and its homegrown Covaxin, developed jointly by Bharat Biotech and the government-run Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)The country started its vaccination program in January for health care workers and priority groups, with the goal of fully inoculating 300 million people by August. But the program had a sluggish start, facing logistical issues as well as vaccine hesitancy among the population -- especially towards Covaxin, which was approved for emergency use before the efficacy data of its third phase trial were released. To date, only 14.3 million people have been fully vaccinated -- just over 1% of India's population of 1.3 billion, according to Johns Hopkins University.But public confidence rose as the government stepped up an awareness campaign to assuage concerns, and the vaccination program picked up speed. As new daily cases accelerated in March and April, several states began reporting major vaccine shortages.A vaccination center in Mumbai, India, that had to turn people away due to a shortage of vaccines on April 9.In Odisha, nearly 700 vaccination centers had to close last week due to shortages, wrote health authorities in a letter to the central government, warning the state would soon exhaust its available stock.Rajesh Bhaskar, a health official in Punjab, told CNN last week the state had about 450,000 doses of Covishield and 30,000 doses of Covaxin. The state is home to more than 27 million people, according to the government's latest available statistics. \"We want to vaccinate about 100,000 people per day at least, and the current supply is insufficient to meet that demand,\" he said.Several districts in Maharashtra, the worst-hit state, had to temporarily suspend vaccination drives, including more than 70 centers in Mumbai that shut last week, according to the state's health minister, Rajesh Tope. Maharashtra had administered more than 11.1 million doses as of Thursday, the most of any Indian states, according to the Indian Ministry of Health.\"In both cities and villages, we have created teams ... to bring all those above 45 years old to take the vaccine,\" Tope said on April 7. \"People are coming to the centers, but our healthcare workers have to tell them that they haven't received the vaccine so they should go home.\"There are several challenges contributing to the shortages -- one being the supply of raw materials, said former ICMR director general Nirmal Kumar Ganguly.\n\n\n\n\nIndia \"has the capacity to produce,\" Ganguly added, but supply chains have been disrupted during the pandemic. The vaccine formulas and required materials \"cannot be changed overnight, so we have to rely on the raw materials being imported.\"The US has placed a temporary ban on exporting raw materials critical for vaccine production -- and the EU has similarly tightened restrictions around vaccine exports. India is now working to \"adapt to the materials which are made at home or the neighboring countries like Singapore,\" but this will take time, said Ganguly.An additional challenge is the country's reliance on SII, he added. There are other vaccine manufacturers in the country, such as Bharat Biotech, but SII remains the largest. \"The need has been glaringly brought out that we need to expand our capacity,\" Ganguly said. \"We are one of the vaccine exporters but these are done by two or three Indian companies at the moment, the rest of them are not big players and some of them are totally new in vaccine production.\"Government's mixed responseSeveral states have requested more doses from the central government -- but federal officials have pushed back, insisting the situation is under control. Tope's complaints were \"nothing but an attempt to divert attention from Maharashtra government's repeated failures to control the spread of pandemic,\" said Indian Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in a statement last week. Home Minister Amit Shah also refuted states' claims, saying their information was \"not true\" and vaccines were available, \"as much as is required.\"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made a point of praising India's vaccination effort as a success. During a meeting with state governors on Wednesday, Modi \"highlighted that India has become the fastest nation to reach the landmark of 10 crore vaccinations (100 million doses),\" according to a statement from his office. India took 85 days to reach 100 million doses. By comparison, the US took 89 days and China 102 days, according to Modi's office.And on Tuesday, Rajesh Bhushan, the health ministry's secretary, said the problem was poor planning and management -- not supply. \"We are making doses available to states in a timely manner,\" he said, adding that states should \"look at how many unutilized doses there are at each cold chain point.\"Their statements were met with outrage from local and state leaders. Shah's assertion was \"factually completely incorrect,\" tweeted Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on April 10.And though a last-minute shipment from the central government had saved Uttarakhand from a complete shortage, it's far from a perfect solution and \"the supply is unpredictable,\" said health department official Kuldeep Martolia on Monday.Boxes of AstraZeneca vaccine, produced by the Serum Institute of India and donated by the Indian government, arrive in Kabul, Afghanistan, on February 7, 2021.In a sign the federal government may be feeling the pressure, it took action this week to open the doors for vaccine imports. On Tuesday, it announced it would fast-track emergency approvals for vaccines already approved by the World Health Organization or authorities in the United States, Europe, Britain and Japan.Companies still need to apply for approval in India, but they will be exempt from having to conduct local safety trials, expediting the process.\"If any of these regulators have approved a vaccine, the vaccine is now ready to be brought into the country for use, manufacture and fill-and-finish,\" Dr. VK Paul, a senior health official at the government-run think tank Niti Aayog, said at a news conference on Tuesday. \"We hope and we invite the vaccine makers such as Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and others ... to be ready to come to India as early as possible.\"The move is \"a calculated step\" by the government to \"ensure we have more vaccines available,\" said Ganguly. The government could also expand its supply through the private market -- but this brings additional challenges too, he said, including the question of how to price vaccines to provide equitable access to the poor.But even the possibility of importing foreign vaccines won't be a quick fix, since companies like Pfizer and Moderna have other orders to fulfill first, including supplying vaccines for the US. India just granted emergency use authorization for Russia's Sputnik vaccine -- but \"by the time they build up manufacturing capacities and manufacturing requirements, it will be five to six months,\" Ganguly said.In the meantime, the government is working to expand local production capacity -- a state-run biomedical institute in Maharashtra was given the green light to manufacture the Covaxin vaccine on Thursday, through a transfer of technology with Bharat Biotech.A Sadhu wearing a face mask takes a holy dip in the Ganges River during the Kumbh Mela festival in Haridwar, India, on April 12.All the while, the second wave roils on, with cases climbing sharply every day. Millions of people are traveling across the country to the city of Haridwar in Uttarakhand for the Kumbh Mela, a Hindu festival and the largest pilgrimage on Earth. Despite warnings of the Covid risks, huge crowds are gathering to hold prayers, attend ceremonies and take holy dips in the Ganges River.Already, cases in Haridwar are spiking -- prompting the state to impose new restrictions on Thursday. At least one religious group attending the festival, the Niranjani Akhada, has asked those from out of state to pull back amid the rise in cases.\"This surge is a very, very threatening sight which is happening at this given moment in India,\" said Ganguly. \"We have never seen anything like this before.\"",

They are believed to have been construction workers as the building was still under construction at the time of the fire. Videos and images showed black smoke billowing out of the building at the company's complex. Fifteen units of the municipal corporation and fire department worked to douse the fire, Mohol said. Preliminary investigations suggest that \"during the building's construction, some welding work could have led to the fire,\" he added.Read MorePune's fire brigade chief Prashant Ranpise said Friday that the fire started on the second floor. As firefighters worked to put out the flames, the blaze reigned in another spot. The second fire was extinguished at 4:15 p.m. local time by 50 firefighters and personnel. Ranpise said they are still investigating the cause of the fire.\"We have learnt that there has unfortunately been some loss of life at the incident. We are deeply saddened and offer our deepest condolences to the family members of the departed,\" SII CEO Adar Poonawalla tweeted Thursday. SII, the world's biggest vaccine maker, is in partnership with Oxford University and AstraZeneca to produce the Covishield vaccine. In December, the company said it was producing 50 to 60 million doses of Covishield per month, with production to be scaled up to 100 million doses in January or February.India embarks on one of the world's most ambitious vaccine rollouts after emergency use approvalA family business started by Poonawalla's father 50 years ago to bring cheaper vaccines to the masses, the Serum Institute of India is aiming to produce hundreds of millions of coronavirus vaccines for not only India, but also other developing countries.In a tweet, Poonawalla said that despite a \"few floors being destroyed,\" production of the Covishield vaccine would not be affected. \"I would like to reassure all governments and the public that there would be no loss of COVISHIELD production due to multiple production buildings that I had kept in reserve to deal with such contingencies,\" he said. Cyrus S. Poonawalla, SII's chairman and managing director, said in a statement that the fire broke out at a facility that was under constriction in the Special Economic Zone at Manjri. He said it was an \"extremely sorrowful day\" and the company would offer INR 2.5 million ($34,000) to each of the victims' families.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted his condolences Thursday: \"Anguished by the loss of lives due to an unfortunate fire ... In this sad hour, my thoughts are with the families of those who lost their lives. I pray that those injured recover at the earliest.\"",

        "content": "London (CNN Business)After teaming up with Oxford University, AstraZeneca produced a safe and effective Covid-19 vaccine in just nine months, a huge achievement that will help end the pandemic. But a series of missteps along the way has led to scathing criticism from policymakers and health officials, tarnishing the company's image as a hero of the coronavirus era.The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker mistakenly gave some volunteers a half dose of the vaccine during clinical trials, and it has been criticized for omitting crucial information from its public statements. US regulators have questioned the accuracy of its vaccine data, and severe production delays in Europe have resulted in a political firestorm and a breakdown in relations with EU leaders.\"What we have with AstraZeneca is a company that is not straightforward, that cannot be relied upon,\" Philippe Lamberts, a Belgian member of the European Parliament, said in a radio interview with the BBC on Wednesday.AstraZeneca's (AZN) failure to deliver tens of millions of promised doses to the European Union, which is struggling to roll out vaccination programs, led the bloc to impose export restrictions that have already prevented at least one shipment of vaccines to Australia. Leaders could move to make the restrictions even tighter Thursday.Meanwhile, the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases expressed concerns earlier this week that AstraZeneca had presented \"outdated\" data from a trial of the vaccine's effectiveness. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the agency's director, called it \"an unforced error\" that could erode trust in a \"very good vaccine.\"Read MoreAstraZeneca updated its data on Thursday, reporting that the trials showed its vaccine to be 76% effective in preventing Covid-19 symptoms. Earlier this week, it had said its shot was 79% effective. The rare rebuke from US regulators was a major blow to the company's credibility.\"They've made one mistake after the other,\" said Jeffrey Lazarus, head of the health systems research group at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health.The AstraZeneca vaccine is administered to a patient at a pharmacy in London.Leap of faithAstraZeneca entered the Covid-19 crisis with little vaccine experience. In recent years, it generated a large portion of its revenue by producing popular cancer drugs, such as Tagrisso, which is used to treat lung cancer.But when the pandemic hit, the company decided to enter the race to develop a game-changing shot.I don't think they ever had any intention to be a vaccine company.\"Andrew Berens, SVB Leerink analyst\"I don't think they ever had any intention to be a vaccine company,\" said Andrew Berens, a pharmaceuticals analyst at SVB Leerink. \"I think that the reason they embarked on this \u2014 and they've been pretty apparent about it \u2014 is they wanted to help humanity and fight the scourge of Covid.\"The efforts paid off. AstraZeneca received emergency use authorization from the United Kingdom in late December and the European Union one month later. Because the vaccine was cheaper and could be stored at higher temperatures than ones developed by Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA), it was heralded as a breakthrough, particularly for less affluent countries that may lack sophisticated logistics networks.AstraZeneca generated more goodwill by pledging to supply its vaccine at no profit during the pandemic, and by partnering with the Serum Institute of India, which agreed to produce more than 1 billion doses for low and middle income countries. They have provided over 30 million doses to more than 58 countries through COVAX, an initiative procuring supplies for poorer nations.\"They came into an area they're not known for and they did really well,\" Lazarus said.Misstep after misstepAlmost immediately, however, problems started cropping up. Before AstraZeneca's shot received emergency use approval, the company faced questions about data from large-scale trials presented in November. Volunteers received different doses due to a manufacturing error, creating confusion about its actual effectiveness. AstraZeneca did not mention that a mistake caused the dosing discrepancy in its initial announcement, generating concerns about a lack of transparency.\"I hate to criticize fellow academics, or anyone for that matter, but releasing information like this is like asking us to try and read the tea leaves,\" Dr. Saad Omer, a vaccine specialist at the Yale School of Medicine, said at the time.In January, Germany's vaccine commission said AstraZeneca's shots shouldn't be given to people older than 65, citing insufficient data for the age group. France also initially limited AstraZeneca vaccines to those under 65. Both countries changed course earlier this month.A nurse prepares a dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine at the Edouard Herriot hospital on Feb. 6 in Lyon, France.Lazarus called such issues \"easily avoidable,\" since they were tied to trial design. AstraZeneca has said that its clinical data supports efficacy in the over-65 age group. In an interview in January, CEO Pascal Soriot said that Oxford scientists running the trials did not want to recruit older people until they had \"accumulated a lot of safety data\" for those aged 18 to 55.Had the vaccine rollout been smooth, such stumbles may have been forgotten. But continued shortages of shots in Europe, which is now facing a third wave of coronavirus infections, have triggered a political crisis in the bloc. EU leaders are meeting Thursday to decide whether to adopt European Commission proposals for even stricter controls on the export of vaccines made in the bloc, including AstraZeneca's.\"We have the option of prohibiting a planned export,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a recent interview with German publishing group Funke Mediengruppe. \"That is the message to AstraZeneca: You first fulfill your contract with Europe before you start delivering to other countries.\"Here's what Covid vaccines are worth to Big PharmaEuropean countries have expressed frustration that the United Kingdom appears to have been prioritized for delivery while it faces shortfalls, and that, unlike others, they have been sending tens of millions of doses abroad. Frustrations boiled over this week after 29 million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine were discovered in a reported \"raid\" on a factory in Italy.A spokesperson for AstraZeneca rejected reports that the doses were part of a \"stockpile,\" saying that the vaccine was made outside the European Union and that it had been brought to the factory to be filled into vials before distribution within Europe and export to low and middle income countries.EU Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said he could not comment on the origin or potential use of the doses reportedly discovered in Italy, but noted that the drugmaker is \"very far away from their contractual commitments.\"Some politicians, and media outlets, may be looking for a scapegoat as vaccination programs stumble. Yet Simona Guagliardo, an analyst with the European Policy Center, said AstraZeneca's delivery delays have \"certainly played a role in slowing down the rollout across Europe.\"\"What appears clearly is AstraZeneca may have overpromised in terms of distribution compared to the effective production capacity,\" Guagliardo said.Tough path forwardAccording to Prashant Yadav, a medical supply chain expert and senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, AstraZeneca seems to have spread itself too thin, with a far-reaching supply chain that's more likely to run into hiccups than those powering vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna. AstraZeneca touts having built more than a dozen regional supply chains to produce its vaccine, with more than 20 partners in over 15 countries.It's also more difficult to predict how much vaccine can be produced from batches of AstraZeneca's product due to the type of components it contains, Yadav added, though that variability perhaps could have been anticipated when drawing up contracts. AstraZeneca did not provide comment for this story, but it has said that deliveries in the European Union were hampered by \"lower-than-expected output from the production process\" and export restrictions imposed by countries outside the bloc.\"As our teams learn from each other and improve their knowledge, the yield is increasing,\" Soriot said in February. \"Manufacturing of a vaccine is a very complex biological process.\"I think it's a very, very difficult thing for AstraZeneca to solve at this juncture.\"Ronn Torossian, CEO of 5W Public RelationsNot all of AstraZeneca's headaches have been the result of corporate blunders, Lazarus observed. He does not fault the company for fears about side effects like blood clots, which caused more than a dozen European countries to pause vaccinations earlier this month. The European Union's regulator conducted an urgent review last week and concluded again that the vaccine is safe to use.But other concerns \u2014 like the alleged misrepresentation of data in its recent US trials \u2014 have undoubtedly damaged the company's reputation, especially in comparison to other drugmakers that have produced safe and effective vaccines but generated fewer negative headlines.Ronn Torossian, CEO of 5W Public Relations, noted that AstraZeneca's slip-ups come at a time when distrust of authorities and the benefits of vaccination remain high, raising the stakes.\"The public's already skeptical,\" he said. \"I think it's a very, very difficult thing for AstraZeneca to solve at this juncture.\"Berens of SVB Leerink thinks the company will be able to move past these problems \u2014 especially since making vaccines isn't a business it relies on to make money. Shares are down more than 2% so far in 2021, lagging gains on the FTSE 100 (UKX), but Pfizer's stock has also lost ground since the start of the year, But Berens does wonder: If AstraZeneca could go back in time, would it choose to get involved in resource-heavy vaccine production again? On that count, he's not so sure.\u2014 Chris Liakos contributed reporting.",

Those statistics don't include children under 18 who make up 41% of India's population and aren't yet eligible for the jab. But even as India races to fully vaccinate its adult population, the country is opening up and exporting millions of vaccine doses. On Friday, the first foreign tourists arrived in the country after an almost 18-month pause, and within the country millions are traveling to celebrate various festivals, with movement expected to increase in November during Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights.\"Experts fear that interstate travel and the possibility of new variants could lead to a third surge in infection -- leaving unvaccinated people and children most at risk.Read More\"It's difficult to predict because the global experience shows that things could turn sour at any point of time,\" said Dr. Anant Bhan, a global health and policy expert from the central Indian city of Bhopal. \"But the trend in India right now is very encouraging.

Second Covid wave beat vaccines India has had two waves of Covid-19 -- one last year before vaccines were available, and the second that began only weeks into the country's ambitious inoculation program earlier this year.The first doses started rolling out in January to vulnerable citizens and frontline workers, part of a priority group of 300 million people -- almost as many people as the entire US population.At the same time, millions of doses of Covishield -- the AstraZeneca vaccine produced in India -- were being exported to other countries and the global vaccine-sharing platform COVAX.

But at home, the world's largest vaccine program was struggling.JUST WATCHEDWhat Modi did in the lead up to India's catastrophic second wave (April, 2021)ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhat Modi did in the lead up to India's catastrophic second wave (April, 2021) 03:39\"We absolutely faced hiccups in the beginning,\" Dr. J.

Jayalal, president of the Indian Medical Association told CNN. \"We weren't able to meet our huge demand, and there was a lot of hesitancy, especially among our rural population.\" Prime Minister Narendra Modi could have prevented India's devastating Covid-19 crisis, critics say. He didn'tVaccination rates were still very low as the second Covid wave built in early March, and by the end of the month, the government had stopped vaccine exports to prioritize Indians. The surge in Covid cases brought panic and despair as millions tried to navigate the country's collapsing health care system. Some desperately posted for help on social media, hopeful to secure a hospital bed or medical oxygen.In April -- weeks before cases peaked at more than 400,000 a day -- vaccine supplies dried up, with at least five out of India's 29 states reporting severe shortages. Several districts in the western state of Maharashtra had to temporarily suspend vaccination drives, including more than 70 centers in financial capital Mumbai, according to the state's health minister, Rajesh Tope.The government faced widespread criticism for its handling of the crisis. For many, Modi underplayed the severity of the pandemic.  Authorities belatedly ramped up the vaccination program, and in August more vaccination centers were opened and education campaigns rolled out in rural areas.

That week, the country crossed a major milestone by delivering at least one dose to more than 60% of its eligible adult population.But like many countries, India's vaccination rates aren't evenly spread. In rural areas, more than 64% of people have received at least one dose of a vaccine. In urban India, where people live in more crowded cities and towns, the figure is close to 35%, according to data from the Ministry of Health.India's challenge is to improve rates across the country -- and most importantly, to vaccinate its children. Children next in lineSince the pandemic began, fewer than 1% of India's Covid-19 deaths were of children under 15, according to the country's Health Ministry. But several states are taking extra precautions and preparing for a worst-case scenario should a third wave hit.Hospitals are stockpiling medical oxygen and some states -- including Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka -- are building Covid-19 treatment facilities, especially for children. \"We don't know how the virus will behave, but we cannot afford to be unprepared this time around,\" Suhas Prabhu, head of the Pediatric Task Force in the western state of Maharashtra, said, according to Reuters. \"No mother should have to run around looking for a hospital bed when her child is sick.\"Many Indians can't prove their loved ones died from Covid. And that could be a problemThe first vaccine available for Indian children over 12 -- ZyCov-D, developed by Gujarat-based Cadila Healthcare Ltd -- was given Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in August.About 10 million doses of the vaccine would be available per month, India's Covid-19 Task Force Chief, V.K. Paul, told CNN affiliate CNN-News18 on Wednesday, adding the government had asked India's National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation for guidance on how to allocate the shot.\"Our priority right now is to continue to explore options for children and adolescents for sure but our thrust is to cover the adult population for which there is no dearth of vaccines anymore,\" he said.Another vaccine, India's homegrown Covaxin, developed by Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council of Medical Research, is expected to be given EUA for children age 2 to 18 soon. However, the World Health Organization has not yet approved it for adults or children. The US-developed Johnson & Johnson and Moderna vaccines are also expected to roll out in India this year, although the timeline is not known -- and neither have been approved for use on children in India.Concern about exports The delivery of 1 billion Covid vaccine doses is a milestone for India, but experts say it has to do much more to reach its target of inoculating its entire adult population by the end of the year. Jayalal from the IMA says the country should be aiming to vaccinate at least 10 million people per day.Then there is the issue of supplies. The IMA worries that by resuming vaccine exports, India could find itself in a similar position to last year -- when demand vastly outnumbered supply. \"Personally, we are not supporting exports,\" said Jayalal. \"We are emphasizing that all our population should get the first dose at least before exports resume.\"JUST WATCHEDIndia's catastrophe threatens global vaccination drive (May, 2021)ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHIndia's catastrophe threatens global vaccination drive (May, 2021) 02:37Some 1 million shots of Covaxin were shipped to Iran last week, the Indian embassy in Tehran confirmed on Twitter. Nepal, Bangladesh and Myanmar have also received India-made vaccines in October, according to Indian officials. Exports are expected to increase significantly in the next few months as domestic stocks build and most of India's population is inoculated with the first dose, officials said on October 14.Dr. Bhan, the global health and policy expert, said while India plays an important role in the world's vaccine supply, a balance must be met. \"We should, of course, offer some of that supply to other countries, especially those where there has been a trickle of supply,\" he said. \"We have ramped up production and local vaccine coverage is going up. But perhaps this is the time for us to enhance manufacturing in a way that supports local and export needs.\" People queue for the Covishield vaccine in Siliguri, West Bengal, on October 1, 2021. A spokesperson from Bharat Biotech, which manufactures Covaxin, said it is not facing any challenges in manufacturing the shot, and is working towards making 1 billion doses in India this year by expanding its production capacity across multiple facilities in the country. SII, which manufactures Covishield, will produce 200 million doses in October, up from 160 million in September, according to the company, after it improved access to raw materials required to make the vaccines.CNN reached out to the Ministry of Health but did not receive a response.  K. Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India, said the country may not achieve full vaccination by the end of the year, but added authorities are \"drawing comfort\" from antibody surveys showing high positivity rates across the country, meaning there is some protection against the virus.\"This is being taken as an indicator of protective immunity acquired either during the Delta-driven second wave or through vaccination even from a single dose,\" he said.Indian authorities will be hoping -- even without both doses -- that protective immunity offers Indians some safety as the long festival season gets underway. The government hasn't announced a ban on religious gatherings and interstate movement, but it's urging the public to remain vigilant and avoid non-essential travel. \"We are starting to get back on our feet again, but we cannot afford to be complacent,\" said Jayalal, the IMA president.\"We are requesting the government not to allow mass gatherings. It's definitely a possibility that a third wave will come, and we need to be ready for it.\"",

        "content": "New Delhi (CNN Business)This time last year, Indian entrepreneurs were in panic mode. The government had locked down the country's entire population in a dramatic step to fight the coronavirus pandemic. Company founders feared the restrictions would leave them in a severe funding crunch that could hurt their ability to expand, pay salaries or even stay afloat. The mood a year later is very different, despite a brutal surge in coronavirus cases that is threatening the economic recovery. India's startup community has found itself in an unprecedented funding bonanza. In the first four months of 2021, 11 companies have attained unicorn status, meaning they've reached a valuation of at least $1 billion, according to data platform Tracxn. Five startups hit that milestone in April alone. By comparison, there were 13 in all of 2020, and 10 in 2019. The ranks of India's super wealthy tech leaders are swelling rapidly as a result.India is trying to build its own internetThe boom is in large part thanks to powerhouse investment by firms such as Tiger Global and SoftBank (SFTBF), which are pumping money into India's fast growing internet businesses \u2014 a prize many investors simply find too big to ignore. Read MoreNot only are more companies amassing this kind of money than ever, but they're also doing so at a record-breaking clip. And some of India's most successful startups \u2014 including Flipkart and Zomato \u2014 are reportedly exploring potential listings this year. Zomato declined to comment and Flipkart did not respond. A Zomato delivery rider waits to cross a road in Kolkata, India. But the seemingly endless fundraising cycles may eventually produce diminishing returns, worry many industry experts, who say India's startup ecosystem needs to start showing consistent profits and healthy exits for investors, and soon. Some observers feel that the huge funding being doled out makes being a \"unicorn\" a less-than-mythical achievement. \"It is great that Indian startups are going through this funding boom. But they will need to find sustainable business models, which make a lot of money, in order to survive,\" said Radhika Gupta, CEO of \u200eEdelweiss Asset Management Limited. \"Even a Google or an Amazon cannot survive on customer numbers alone.\" First, the good newsThe investment craze is due to the rise of India's digital economy. There are more than 700 million internet users in the country and roughly half a billion yet to come online, creating enormous potential in the marketplace.The pandemic, meanwhile, has encouraged people outside of major cities to spend money online, speeding up digitization of businesses and opening up more opportunities for technology entrepreneurs. Financial technology firms have been the biggest winners. By the end of 2020, India had 44 unicorns, and most were in the fintech sector, according to a report by Orios Venture Partners. Retail and software as a service companies are next in line. The venture capital firm also found that the time it takes for a tech startup to reach a $1 billion valuation has shrunk dramatically, from nearly 15 years in 2005 to 2.4 years in 2016 and 2017. This year alone, app developer Mohalla Tech, investment startup Groww, and messaging platform Gupshup have all become unicorns \u2014 largely because of big investments from Tiger Global, according to Tracxn data. The New York-based investment company, which also made big early bets on Flipkart \u2014 the e-commerce giant acquired by Walmart (WMT) in 2018 \u2014 has been more bullish than other firms on the country.Tiger Global did not respond to a request from CNN Business for comment, but the firm has in the past praised the businesses it has invested in as well positioned in India's growing internet market.Risk of bloatSome experts, though, have started questioning how much money big investment firms are pouring into the sector. \"They over-capitalize the company by giving 1.5 times or 2 times the amount needed,\" said Amit Ranjan, co-founder of presentation-sharing service SlideShare. He's now working with the Indian government on a virtual locker project called DigiLocker.\"There is no justification for this except to bludgeon the competition,\" Ranjan told CNN Business.But Rehan Yar Khan, managing partner at Orios Venture Partners, doesn't see the influx of money as a \"big worry.\" After all, companies still need massive amounts of capital to capture the potential of India's vast market. Why Silicon Valley's biggest companies are investing billions in IndiaHe cited PharmEasy, an online pharmacy firm, as an example. Khan was an early investor in the firm, which became a unicorn earlier this year.\"E-pharmacies have covered only 3% of India's market,\" Khan said. \"... So naturally they need more money to grow.\" But there are other headaches to consider, too. What happens if a unicorn becomes over-funded and fizzles before it has an exit plan?Flipkart is the only Indian tech unicorn to have been acquired at a valuation of more than $1 billion. (E-commerce firm Shopclues, which was valued at $1 billion in 2016, was acquired three years later by a Singapore-based company. But by then, Shopclues' value had collapsed to between $50 million and $80 million.) Employees work on laptop computers at the Flipkart  headquarters in Bengaluru, India. Only a handful of Indian tech firms have held listings over the the last two decades. And no tech startup worth more than $1 billion has gone public.\"By inflating valuations in the private market, you are postponing your ability to go into the public market,\" said Karthik Reddy, co-founder of venture capital firm Blume Ventures. He believes that Indian firms have to think about initial public offerings sooner rather than later in order to build a sustainable startup ecosystem. \"We don't have large tech acquirers, so you can't wait for a Walmart to come and buy your biggest asset every time,\" he added.Could this be the year?There are murmurs in Indian tech circles about huge upcoming exits. Reddy is optimistic that 2021 may be remembered not just for its funding boom, but also for bringing about a cultural shift in the industry. Indian conglomerate Tata Sons is reportedly looking to buy online grocer BigBasket for more than $1 billion, the Mint newspaper reported last month. Asked for comment, Tata Sons referred CNN Business to BigBasket, which did not respond.Other Indian media outlets have reported over the last few months that older unicorns may consider listing soon, too. And the Economic Times reported last week that several startups are scrambling to recruit senior executives with some IPO experience. Should either Flipkart or food tech company Zomato follow through with an IPO, such listings could be game-changers, according to Reddy.\"India needs to unleash its tech firms on the public market,\" he said. \"Right now Indian citizens have hardly any exposure to the unicorn boom.\"",

        "content": "New Delhi (CNN Business)It's turning into a monumental year for India's stock market, as yet another big startup makes its public debut. But Paytm, which started trading in Mumbai on Thursday, spoiled the party: Its shares opened below the 2,150 rupees ($28.60) issue price, before closing down 27% at 1,564 rupees ($21).The flop reflects fears about Paytm's business. The company, which is now worth almost $14 billion, lost hundreds of millions of dollars last year and seems far from ready to turn a profit. It's also up against growing competition from some of the biggest tech firms in the world.The digital payments company raised 183 billion rupees ($2.5 billion) in its initial public offering. It's the largest ever in the country when measured in local currency, surpassing Coal India's in 2010. That IPO was worth 155 billion rupees ($3.48 billion), according to data from Refinitiv.India's newest billionaire Falguni Nayar built a beauty empire\"The outcome of the IPO was not in doubt,\" Madhur Deora, the president and group CFO of Paytm, told CNN Business last week. The former investment banker has been with the company for five years.Read MoreBut the amount of attention it drew took him by surprise.With backing from investors such as Warren Buffett, Masayoshi Son and Alibaba (BABA), Paytm is one of India's best funded startups. Its public debut has been keenly watched by professional and amateur investors alike. India has been churning out billion-dollar startups for years, but the rush for those unicorns to go public started only a few months ago. \"A lot of well-wishers and friends messaged [me], saying, 'Oh, I'm getting a prayer done at Golden Temple for Paytm's success,\" said Deora, referring to the central place of worship of the Sikh religion.They weren't alone. Paytm's founder, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, went to \"seek blessing of God\" at the Tirupati Temple, one of India's most famous places of worship, on November 8 \u2014 the day Paytm launched its IPO.That day also marked five years since Prime Minister Narendra Modi banned two of the country's biggest currency notes. The move was hugely disruptive for the economy, but it helped Paytm grow at an explosive rate: The company signed 10 million new users within a month. It made us \"a folklore name in this country,\" Shekhar told CNN Business in 2019. Thanks to the momentum provided by the cash ban, Paytm is now the biggest payments platform in one of the world's fastest growing economies. It has 337 million registered consumers and 22 million merchants, according to its IPO filing.At the listing ceremony on Thursday, an emotional Sharma called the company's purpose of bringing millions of Indians into the mainstream economy \"pious.\"Mixed signalsForeign investors have been enthusiastic. The company raised $1.1 billion from BlackRock and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board just before the IPO opened, according to an exchange filing. And on the day of the launch earlier this month, Softbank (SFTBF) founder and existing Paytm investor Son declared that,\"for us, their IPO should be a great event.\"However, the response in India has been different.While Paytm's IPO was eventually fully subscribed, much of the local media coverage has been lukewarm, highlighting that the company took longer to find buyers for its shares than two other Indian startups in recent months, food delivery company Zomato and e-commerce firm Nykaa. Zomato shares soar in red-hot start for first Indian unicorn to go public\"I think the real story here is that someone aimed to do something that had not been attempted before and many thought could not be done in the Indian capital markets,\" Deora said, in reference to the challenge of launching such a large IPO before the company has turned a profit. Paytm's losses have analysts worried about whether the company can justify its valuation. The company, based in the New Delhi suburb of Noida, posted a loss of 17 billion rupees ($230 million) last year on revenue of 31.86 billion rupees ($430 million). Profits aren't on the horizon any time soon.Madhur Deora, a President at SoftBank-backed Indian payments firm Paytm, poses for a photograph inside his house in Mumbai, India, Sept. 22, 2020. \"We expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future and we may not achieve profitability in the future,\" it said in its IPO filings, adding that the company will continue to spend heavily on hiring, marketing and building infrastructure. \"Two years ago, we were in this super high investment phase where we were creating a lot of consumer and merchant traction on the platform,\" Deora said. \"We have found that it is easier \u2014 much easier \u2014 than two years ago to acquire and retain customers, hence, we are spending a lot less.\" Having said that, he added, \"our aim is to reach 500 million Indians ... So we would continue to spend on marketing.\"As the cost of data and internet in India falls, its population of 1.3 billion is coming online at a rapid pace. Paytm expects the number of smartphone users in India to hit 800 million in the next five years, giving a significant boost to its business.Next phase of growthSkeptics have pointed to mounting competition, particularly as Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOGL) have joined the fray by launching their own mobile payments systems that make use of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), an Indian government-backed technology.Deora said he is not worried, as UPI-based payments make just one \"chunk\" of Paytm's business, which has now expanded into commerce, lending and other sectors.While financial services are a relatively new part of the company's business, Deora said he is excited about the opportunity to be \"democratic\" with lending, and reach everyone from the self-employed to the daily-wage laborer. The company plans on strengthening this business with the money it has raised.\"A vast majority of Indians do not have access to formal credit .... They just don't have a credit history,\" he said. \"So there's a lot of what we call [India's] underserved or unserved.\" \"There's a huge market in providing access to credit,\" he added. Paytm has partnered with banks \u2014 including the country's largest private lender, HDFC \u2014 to provide services ranging from personal loans to buy now, pay later options. \"Pay later really suits the needs of younger millennials in the country, because many of them just find the process of getting credit anywhere else not suitable for them,\" Deora said.",

To him, reining in private enterprise is the solution to fixing longstanding concerns about consumer rights, data privacy, excess debt and economic inequality.In other words, for the Chinese Communist Party it's not about killing the private sector: It's about taming the excesses of capitalism and embracing the country's history of socialism.\"Common prosperity is the prosperity of all the people, the material and spiritual life of the people being rich,\" Xi wrote in an article published last month by a Communist Party journal, invoking a historically significant phrase that dates back to the time of Chairman Mao Zedong. \"It is not the prosperity of a few people.\"Ant Group's highly anticipated IPO was suspended just over a week after founder Jack Ma accused China's conventional, state-controlled banks of having a \"pawn shop\" mentality.Dividing the 'cake'China is one of the world's most unequal major economies, according to the World Bank. Its Gini coefficient \u2014 a popular measure of inequality \u2014 has increased significantly over the past four decades, coinciding with the country's staggering rate of economic growth.That meteoric rise accelerated under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, who took power in the late 1970s after the death of Mao.Under Deng, the country embraced the free market and opened up to global trade. He famously said in 1985 that \"some people can get rich first\" to help poorer people in the long run, so that the society can gradually achieve \"common prosperity\" \u2014 a use of the phrase that differed significantly from its invocation by Mao, who advocated for wealth redistribution nearly 70 years ago as he worked to cement the party's control.China sparked an economic miracle -- now there's a fight over its legacyWorsening inequality now appears to be vexing Xi, the country's most powerful leader in decades. Just last year, his government concluded a five-year long fight against absolute poverty. Now he's widely expected to seek a third presidential term next year, and has focused his time on reducing the wealth gap.\"We must divide the cake well,\" Xi wrote in last month's article, adding that his goal is to \"achieve common prosperity of all people by the middle of this century.\"Xi Jinping delivers a speech at a ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. Worsening inequality now appears to be vexing the country's most powerful leader in decades.A desire for controlAnalysts widely believe that Xi's concerns about inequality are real, but that the unfolding crackdown also signals the ruling Chinese Communist Party's desire for control.Xi is \"aware that a Communist Party regime only enjoys legitimacy as long as common people feel represented,\" said Sonja Opper, a professor at Bocconi University in Italy who studies China's economy and the private sector. \"The ultimate motivation is more likely to gain control over powerful parts of the economy.\"The business crackdown that dominated much of this year is believed to have started after Ma \u2014 easily the most recognizable of China's business elite \u2014 blasted China's financial system during a controversial speech in October 2020.Founder  of Alibaba Group Jack Ma has all but disappeared from public life as the tech crackdown has taken shape over the last year.Ma criticized China's regulatory system at the time as being outdated and risk averse, an obstacle to the high flying, innovative tech firms that he said could bring banking to poor populations and smaller businesses that are otherwise locked out of traditional finance.The tech entrepreneur also accused China's conventional, state-controlled banks of having a \"pawn shop\" mentality by lending only to borrowers who could provide collateral. He touted more innovative, data-heavy approaches as capable of bringing banking to marginalized groups. Those words likely spurred Beijing to retaliate swiftly. The Ant Group IPO was suspended just over a week later. Since then, life has only gotten more difficult for Ma, Ant Group and China's other corporate giants. The usually flamboyant Ma has all but disappeared from public life, and has even reportedly left the helm of an elite business school he founded.China's 'revolution' cost investors $3 trillion. So why aren't they running scared?Ant Group was forced to overhaul its business and become a financial holding company, meaning it is much more heavily regulated than it ever was before. Ma's Alibaba (BABA), meanwhile, was hit earlier this year with a record $2.8 billion fine for behaving like a monopoly, and the company has lost roughly $400 billion in market value in the last year as it navigates a slew of new regulations from Beijing.More than Jack MaMa's business empire isn't the only one affected. Meituan, Tencent (TCEHY), Pinduoduo (PDD) and other tech firms have also been investigated or fined over alleged anti-competitive behavior. And the ride-hailing app Didi \u2014 which went public in the United States despite reported concerns from Chinese regulators \u2014 was banned from app stores and probed over questions about data security.The Communist Party \"seems increasingly concerned that China's tech sector has become so globally prominent that it runs the danger of outrunning the Party itself,\" said Rana Mitter, a professor who specializes in the history and politics of modern China at the University of Oxford. \"The crackdown helps to bring it down to size.\"China's biggest private companies are in chaos. It's all part of Beijing's planThe clampdown has extended well beyond tech. Rules published in July upended China's $120 billion for-profit tutoring sector. Additional guidelines released that month tightened oversight of the country's massive food delivery industry.The real estate market, which was already being roiled by government efforts to curb excessive borrowing by developers, has also been under intense scrutiny this year. Authorities have announced more than 400 regulations on the sector this year as they try to cut down on property debt and bring home prices under control, according to statistics compiled by Centaline Property, a Hong Kong-based property agency.The government has also turned its attention to cultural and societal issues that authorities have deemed \"unhealthy\" or \"toxic,\" including overwork, unruly celebrity behavior and excessive time spent with video games. Other areas of pop culture have been scrutinized as well.Wary of private tech's powerExperts point to the crackdown \u2014 and especially the measures directed at technology \u2014 as the start of a new era for regulation in China. Companies like Ant Group and Didi have rapidly ascended in recent years to become powerhouses in their fields. Alipay, operated by Ant Group, dominates China's mobile payment market with a 56% share. Didi has a near monopoly of the ride-hailing market, with about a 90% share.Beijing encouraged their rise at first. Such firms have been huge job creators and have attracted vast amounts of foreign and domestic capital. China's influence as a hub for technological innovation has also exploded in recent years because of these firms, which compete head to head with Western rivals.But now the government is growing wary of their size and power.Firms like Alibaba, Tencent and Didi \"will no longer be able to stay under the protective umbrella of Internet or technology, outside of supervision from the Chinese government,\" said Doug Guthrie, a professor and director of China Initiatives at Arizona State University's Thunderbird School of Global Management.The flag of China is flown behind a pair of surveillance cameras outside the Central Government Offices in Hong Kong.Beijing is also clearly concerned about the collection of data by these private firms. The technology they have created is so prevalent in Chinese life that they have access to sensitive information about hundreds of millions of people, ranging from where and when they travel to specific details about how they spend their money.\"It cannot go unnoticed that the industries and sectors that came under fire are all part of the modern tech economy, controlling vast amounts of individual level data,\" said Opper from Bocconi University. She added that data \"is an invaluable resource for any government wishing to control all walks of life.\"Beijing's interest in Big Data was apparent this summer, as the government's probe of Didi and other Chinese companies that trade in the United States took shape. Authorities focused on  allegations that those firms mishandled sensitive data about their users in China, posing risks to personal privacy and national cybersecurity.Those regulations \"may therefore simply reflect the desire to gain control over the type of data and technology that is currently controlled by China's most innovative, private technology corporations,\" Opper said.Economic slump may bring change of pace Beijing has signaled the crackdown may not be over yet. In August, the party's top leaders unveiled a major policy blueprint for the next five years, in which they pledged to strengthen regulations on tech, financial services, education, and tutoring firms \u2014 areas of what they called \"vital interest.\"But other factors might force the government to slow the pace and scale at which it is trying to transform private enterprise.The world's second largest economy has encountered a slew of challenges that are weighing heavily on economic growth, including disruptions due to the global shipping crisis, a massive energy crunch and concerns about a debt crisis in real estate. Last quarter marked the slowest pace of GDP growth in a year. The crackdown on tech and education firms hasn't helped, with demands for rapid change resulting in job losses and a drag on retail sales.\"My prediction: The 'crackdown' is going to stop now,\" Guthrie said.\"The Xi administration is very committed to economic growth,\" he added. \"They have made their point about the coordination between the government and the private sector. But they know they need an entrepreneurial private sector to continue to drive China's growth.\"China's real estate crisis could threaten growth into 2022. Beijing's undeterredThere has been some indication that the regulatory push is slowing down. Guo Shuqing, chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, told state broadcaster CCTV last month that the new regulations for financial tech firms have \"yielded initial results.\" He said he expects to achieve \"even more significant progress\" before the end of the year. Even Ma is reportedly turning up in public again. Reuters reported last month that the tech billionaire was spotted on a cruise in Spain, his first trip outside China since the crackdown began. The government wants companies to understand that they need to be in \"lock step\" with authorities, said Guthrie, who added that \"no one gets to think of themselves as bigger or more global than the Chinese government.\"But he acknowledged that Beijing knows it needs Chinese tech to flourish.\"My sense is that the support and coordination between the government and the private sector is coming back into alignment,\" he added.",

        "content": "Washington, DC (CNN)Bob Galyen has spent his career building electric car batteries. And he thinks the United States has a problem.   Galyen, who engineered the battery for the General Motors EV1, the first mass-produced electric vehicle, and also served as chief technology officer at a Chinese company that's the top battery producer in the world, isn't the only one. Elected officials, automakers and customers in the US are all excited about the possibility of electric cars, and those cars will be key to the US meeting its climate goals. Simply building and selling electric cars, or providing subsidies for the people who make and buy them, isn't enough. Electric cars need batteries the same way combustion cars need fuel -- and the metal in those batteries can be just as precious and hard to get as gas. People like Galyen are worried the US simply isn't ready for that switchover, or doing enough to get ready. The United States sources about 90% of the lithium it uses from Argentina and Chile, and contributes less than 1% of global production of nickel and cobalt, according to the Department of Energy. China refines 60% of the world's lithium and 80% of the cobalt. Those metals are critical for electric vehicles.  Galyen said he's struggled to get the United States to create a long-term plan for electric batteries, instead watching as priorities shift depending on what political party holds the White House. The Biden administration has pushed for electric vehicles, yet halted mining projects in Arizona and Minnesota that would boost domestic supply of electric vehicle materials.  Read More\"We have neither the raw materials nor the manufacturing capacity,\" Galyen told CNN Business. \"If the wrong country goes to war with us, we don't have enough batteries to support our military.\"  The Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) production facilities stand in Ningde, Fujian province, China. CATL is the world's largest battery maker.\"China could shut down the world's electric vehicle transition for political reasons,\" Jeffrey Wilson, research director of the Perth USAsia Centre at the University of Western Australia, told CNN Business. \"As of today, there'd be nothing we could do to stop that in the short term.\"  Wilson pointed to the possibility of China restricting exports of lithium hydroxide to give its domestic electric battery and vehicle manufacturers an advantage. (Lithium hydroxide, which is critical for batteries, is largely processed in China.) He said that a 2010 incident when China restricted Japanese access to rare earth minerals during a dispute between the countries showed the risk isn't out of the question.  Ganfeng's Mahong facility in Xinyu, in China's Jiangxi province, produces lithium hydroxide, a critical substance in producing batteries for electric vehicles.Others say the national security risks that come with the shift to electric may be less than those posed by oil. It's not in the best interest of foreign countries to restrict US battery supplies, some suggest.  \"If China decided to pull the plug on [electric vehicles], batteries, and battery cells today, then there would be a huge problem for [the electric vehicle] transition,\" Tom Moerenhout, a Columbia University professor who studies global energy policy. \"But China has no interest in doing that.\"  The rush for batteries  President Biden has called for 50% of vehicle sales to be electric by 2030, a goal that Ford and GM have echoed. California has said all new vehicles must be zero emission by 2035. The bipartisan infrastructure bill is investing $7.5 billion in electric vehicle charging.    \"There have been a lot of bold things said that would be somewhat difficult to back up with the reality on the ground with raw material supply,\" Francis Wedin, the CEO of Vulcan Energy, a lithium company developing a project in Germany, told CNN Business.   Mining experts say that the extraction and processing of battery metals has been largely overlooked. The popularity of electric vehicles hasn't impacted how the US government treats mining, they say.  \"You can't win a football match with just a star quarterback. You got to have a whole team,\" said Emily Hersh, the CEO of Luna Lithium, a mining startup that's exploring projects in Nevada.  It can take seven to 10 years to get a mine set up, and sometimes longer.   Lithium for batteries is extracted through evaporation in a brine pool in Argentina. This pool is owned by a subsidiary of Neo Lithium, which a Chinese company purchased.Prices for critical battery metals prices like lithium, nickel and cobalt have spiked in recent months. Some automakers like Tesla have made deals with suppliers of raw materials recently, which may help insulate them from shortages.    The government has offered subsidies for electric vehicle purchases and charging infrastructure, but the mining sector hasn't seen similar support, the battery metals experts say.  A challenge for US leaders is what to do when the country's values come into conflict, including electrical vehicle adoption, environmental preservation and halting America's historic mistreatment of indigenous people.  Last month the Biden administration canceled leases for a planned nickel mine in Minnesota, called Twin Metals, due to environmental concerns. Last year Biden slowed a copper mining project in Oak Flat, Arizona that the Trump and Obama administrations had previously pushed for alongside Congress. The Biden administration said it wanted to better understand the concerns of Indigenous people and environmental impacts.   Resolution Copper wants to mine copper in Oak Flat, located on land sacred to the Apache and part of the Tonto National Forest in Miami, Arizona.Electric vehicle proponents say the technology is an environmental good. The vehicles have a smaller lifetime carbon footprint than traditional vehicles, unless they last only a few years. Electric vehicles have fewer emissions as there's no tailpipe, leaving only brake pad discharge and tire wear. Electric vehicles also lessen the need for fossil fuels like gas.  But electric vehicle batteries rely on metals that are mined, like lithium, nickel, cobalt, copper and graphite. Mining in the US is often associated with its negative environmental impacts. The battery metals experts say the negatives are a tradeoff we must accept for a greater environmental good. They argue that the US has better mining standards than some foreign countries, so there are global environmental benefits of mining at home.  The Biden administration has largely avoided discussion of mining and its significance to electric vehicles. Biden made a brief reference to \"metallurgy\" in last year's State of the Union, describing it as a job of the future.   A White House report from June 2021 called for resilient supply chains and acknowledged the security risk of the country's shortcomings on batteries.  \"Innovations essential to military preparedness\u2014like highly specialized lithium-ion batteries\u2014require an ecosystem of innovation, skills, and production facilities that the United States currently lacks,\" the authors wrote.  Howard Klein, founder of RK Equity, an investment group focused on lithium, feels that the country has soured on mining, at its own expense.  \"Lithium, nickel and graphite are clean energy metals,\" Klein said. \"If we don't do this, the green agenda is goodbye.\"    When risks are hard to size up and agree on Historically, there have been examples of the \"resource curse,\" in which natural resource wealth contributes to negative impacts for countries, including corruption, violence and durable authoritarian regimes. Decades of US policy in the Middle East, for example, with its attendant support for dictatorships and warfare, have been argued to be largely motivated by abundant petroleum supplies in the region. \"Resource curse\" concerns in this case could be most pertinent to Bolivia, which has a wealth of lithium reserves and has weaker political institutions than other battery-metal rich countries like Australia and Chile, according to Emily Kilcrease, a senior fellow in energy, economics and security at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington-based think-tank.  \"I might argue that Chinese investments into lithium mines are a bigger threat to U.S. raw material supply chains, rather than political instability,\" Kilcrease said.  Chinese companies own stakes in South American mining companies like Pilbara Minerals and SQM. Last year the Chinese company Zijin Mining bought Neo Lithium, a Canadian company with an Argentine lithium project.  For some national security experts, concerns about the electric vehicle supply chain are overblown. A Tesla Model 3 seen in the battery marriage section at the Tesla factory in Fremont, California. Eugene Gholz, a Notre Dame political science professor who previously advised the Pentagon, said national security concerns over energy have been exaggerated before, like with oil. He believes that's happening again.  Gholz thinks the national security risk of electric vehicle adoption are small, and less than the oil supply chain.  \"F-35s won't fall out of the sky because we don't have access to cobalt imports,\" Gholz told CNN Business. \"It's not like you need to constantly deliver diesel to the forward operating base. Once the base has a battery, it's got a battery for years.\"  There are good reasons for China not to restrict US access to electric vehicle batteries. Doing so would damage its economy. China also depends on US allies like Australia and Chile to supply it with raw battery materials to refine.   He views warnings of national security and electric vehicles as a strategy to trigger government funding.   \"We have confidence in very few institutions in the United States,\" Gholz said. \"The American people have confidence in the military. If you can say we have to do something to preserve the military, that has political resonance.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Mobility in the cities of 2030 could look very different from today. \"Robot shuttles will pick you up from your house in the suburbs and take you to a mobility hub station in downtown. Then you'll end your daily commute to the office riding an e-scooter (electric scooter) that you previously pre-booked on your mobile devices.\" That's the future imagined by Kersten Heineke, who leads the Center for Future Mobility for consulting firm McKinsey & Company. It might sound far-fetched, but electric, autonomous robot shuttle buses are already in use and e-scooters are growing in popularity. In the US, 38.5 million journeys were made on e-scooters in 2018, which rose to 86 million in 2019, according to the National Association of City Transportation.  Women ride shared electric scooters in Santa Monica, California, in July 2018. E-scooters are an example of \"micromobility\" -- lightweight, often electric individual transport intended to cover short distances. McKinsey forecasted in pre-pandemic research that the global market might worth between $300-500 billion in 10 years.Read MoreWhile lockdowns depressed the use of e-scooters over the first months of 2020, McKinsey says the pandemic could actually encourage widespread adoption. \"It's a big driver,\" Heineke says, \"because public transit is not considered safe and not everybody has access to a private vehicle. Folks have opted more and more towards micromobility.\"Fehmarnbelt Tunnel will be the world's longest immersed tunnelOther factors could fuel long-term success. McKinsey says that about 60% of car trips worldwide cover less than 8 kilometers and Heineke believes that in cities, e-scooters and e-bikes can save people time that they'd otherwise spend stuck in traffic or looking for parking spots.Sustainability is another driver, with growing public awareness of climate change.\"Micromobility is always electric by design,\" Heineke says. \"Consumers are caring about how they get from A to B and how much CO2 they produce. Electrification is the basic enabler and a strong accelerator for the adoption of this type of mobility.\"With a lack of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles and inconsistent road regulations, micromobility has challenges to overcome. But Heineke believes cities can help by adopting forward-thinking policies. \"Cities can incentivize the use by making more bike lanes, taking away parking spots or increasing parking prices and, above all, integrating micromobility with public transport,\" he says.Milan's micromobilityMilan is a city that has used the Covid-19 crisis to aggressively promote e-scooters and bikes.\"We launched the first micromobility proposals in 2018, but the pandemic sped up this transition,\" says Marco Granelli, Milan council member for mobility. \"In just a few months, we had the need to move to a more sustainable mobility.\"As coronavirus cases spiked in the city in March, Milan had to find ways to keep the city open for business. Investing in micromobility seemed to be the perfect solution.A man rides an electric scooter on a pop-up bike lane on Corso Buenos Aires, in Milan, on September 23, 2020.The city implemented a plan called \"Strade Aperte\" (Open Streets), which added new 20mph speed zones and 35 kilometers (22 miles) of bike lanes, with a goal of reaching 100 km by April 2021. It also increased the size of the city's fleet of e-scooters available for public hire from 2,500 to 6,000, with a plan grow it further in the future. \"Before the pandemic hit, 700,000 cars entered Milan every single day,\" Granelli says. \"We now follow two principles: decreasing the traffic by using vehicles that occupy less public roads, and reducing CO2 levels in the air. Micromobility solutions are offering the best performance in that regard.\"Struggling to work productively from home? Let strangers watch youGranelli says Milan will keep investing in micromobility. The city has already set aside \u20ac7.5 million ($9.1 million) for new bike lanes and \u20ac5.2 million ($6.3 million) to adopt more e-bikes and e-scooters.\"People are using them,\" he says. Cameras filming one large road found that between 5,000 and 6,000 e-scooters and bikes passed by every day in November. \"That's 20% of total traffic there, more than double the pre-Covid levels.\"If Milan's efforts are echoed in other cities, Heineke's vision of a future that embraces micromobility could be one step closer to reality.",

Now, scientists and engineers want to use artificial intelligence (AI) to rethink the way we use our roads and reduce congestion post-pandemic.Michael Ganser is an engineer with Kapsch TrafficCom, an Austrian company that provides intelligent transportation systems. \"Building new roads or adding new lanes alone is not sustainable,\" he says. Ganser believes the solution to gridlock lies in a combination of smart traffic lights, connected vehicles and congestion charges -- all informed by AI. In cities including Madrid and Mumbai, Kapsch TrafficCom has implemented a system where roadside sensors, traffic cameras and vehicles collect data on things like road works, accidents and congestion.Could the pandemic drive an e-scooter revolution?The information is fed into a central system and a prediction model creates a comprehensive view of traffic conditions in real-time. The system is then able to adjust the timing of traffic light signals, so that they improve the flow of vehicles.  In the future motorists will be sent information via an app telling them which routes to take to avoid congestion, as well as the optimum speed they should drive.Read MoreKapsch, along with other companies, has worked with cities such as Singapore to implement a variable congestion charge that makes it cheaper to travel outside peak times, which encourages drivers to avoid rush hour.Ganser says combining smart lights, connected vehicles, and congestion charges \"leads to a traffic system that, under good conditions, allows almost jam-free roads.\" He estimates that combination could reduce congestion by around 75%, saving large cities billions of dollars every year. Buenos AiresThe Argentine capital of Buenos Aires is one of the most populous cities in Latin America. It has over 3 million residents, and an additional 3 million commuters from adjacent towns travel there every day. To manage its roads the city implemented a number of intelligent traffic devices, but it needed a way to coordinate the different technologies. Buenos Aires officials worked with Kapsch TrafficCom to integrate the city's existing traffic management systems. Having the disparate traffic data going into a single network means information can be exchanged more effectively and provide commuters with real-time advice, according to Alan Balfour, director of the city's Special Projects Unit for Mobility Infrastructure.\"The ability we have today to manage transit through this tool allows us to control traffic flow and support tomorrow's sustainable mobility with quality planning,\" says Balfour.Busy Buenos Aires streets, in March 2020.Time and moneyBefore the pandemic, traffic congestion cost EU economies \u20ac100 billion ($118 billion) annually. A report by traffic analytics firm INRIX revealed that in the US, the total cost of lost productivity stood at $88 billion in 2019.There's also the issue of time: American commuters wasted about 99 hours a year on average and British commuters about 178 hours a year due to congestion.Damon Wischik researches traffic flow optimization using AI at Cambridge University. He's developing software to control traffic signals in UK cities. He equates \"queues of cars at traffic lights as blocks in Tetris,\" which can be re-routed using AI. \"If you treat cities like a computer game, it can learn to clear congestion,\" Wischick says. Fehmarnbelt Tunnel will be the world's longest immersed tunnelBut he thinks technology alone isn't the solution. Wischik believes drivers need to be prepared to change their habits and to travel outside peak traffic times.\"It all comes down to -- can you change people's behavior, and can you make people willing to accept some slight change in behavior if it's imposed on them?\" he says.While road traffic in many places plummeted during initial lockdowns, there are signs that as restrictions are lifted, many people are choosing to drive rather than take public transport. Any traffic benefits from the pandemic may be short-lived, unless cities rethink their traffic management. When it comes to tomorrow's mobility, Ganser believes digital technologies are the solution. \"They are inexpensive and easy to scale,\" he says. \"So if society wants a quick win that brings down carbon emissions and gets rid of congestion, this is the way to go.\"This story has been updated to better clarify the notification function of the Kapsch TraffiCom app, and to add that other companies were also involved in implementing the congestion charge in Singapore.",

        "content": "Washington, DC (CNN Business)Virgin Hyperloop gave the first ride on its test track Sunday in Las Vegas, but it will be years before the public can potentially take a high-speed ride on a hyperloop.A hyperloop is an unproven transportation system in which people travel in a vehicle in a vacuum tube at speeds as high as 600 mph. Virgin's system includes magnetic levitation, much like used in advanced high speed rail projects in Japan and Germany.Magnetic levitation lifts a train car above a track, as the magnets' like poles push the train upward. The magnets also propel the train as like poles repel and push the train forward, and the opposite poles attract and pull the train forward. Magnetic levitation has been used on some train systems since the 1970s. Virgin Hyperloop selects West Virginia as the future home of its new high-tech certification centerVirgin Hyperloop's pod only reached 100 mph on the track, according to the company, rather than the 600 mph that hyperloop advocates have long promised. Virgin Hyperloop says its track is 500 meters long, limiting how fast the pods can go.Still, Virgin Hyperloop executives view the test as a major milestone and a step toward commercializing hyperloop technology. Read MoreJosh Giegel, Virgin Hyperloop's Chief Technology Officer, and Sara Luchian, its Director of Passenger Experience, took the first ride. They sat in Virgin Hyperloop's two-person pod, which includes seat belts, plush seats and small windows.Giegel told CNN Business that hyperloop pods can travel at the speed of aircraft but with a fraction of the energy consumption. Virgin Hyperloop had its first human passengers at its test track in Las Vegas, Nevada.Virgin Hyperloop envisions building systems that connect cities. Giegel said that its future commercial systems will have pods that seat between 25 and 30 people. Giegel said Virgin Hyperloop envisions carrying tens of thousands of passengers per hour. Hyperloop systems can run either above ground or below ground, but so far the company has focused on above-ground projects. Tunneling below ground can be time consuming and expensive.Hurdles remain before a commercial hyperloop system is built. Virgin Hyperloop still needs to raise enough money for its next project, a six-mile, $500 million test facility in West Virginia. Walder said that pods at the facility wouldn't reach 600mph, but declined to share how fast they would go. The test facility is being built to certify Virgin Hyperloop's technology.Walder believes that the company's hyperloop system will be certified in 2025 or 2026, and that we could see hyperloop projects before the decade ends. Virgin Hyperloop expects to have its technology certified by 2025 or 2026.Virgin Hyperloop isn't alone in its interest in hyperloops. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk announced a concept for such a system in 2013.Then in 2017, Musk tweeted that he had \"verbal govt approval\" to build a tunnel from Washington, DC to New York, in which trips could take 29 minutes. The first leg of the project is mired in an environmental review, and there's no clear timeline for it being completed.Musk's hyperloop venture, the Boring Company, has focused on building tunnels under cities, for a lower speed service in Tesla vehicles that don't require a vacuum tube. It's currently building a system in Las Vegas, called \"Loop.\"Virgin Hyperloop was founded as Hyperloop Technologies in 2014. Richard Branson joined its board of directors in 2017, and the company's name was changed then.",

        "content": "Hong Kong (CNN Business)Rising sea levels are boosting the need for flood defenses. But the main material used in many man-made barriers is concrete, which can inflict its own huge cost on the climate and sea life. In a bid to make shoreline construction more sustainable, an Israeli startup called ECOncrete has come up with a range of products that can reduce the carbon footprint of concrete and attract marine life.Concrete-based structures on coastlines certainly have benefits \u2014 with structures like sea walls, breakwaters and ports shoring up human habitats. But most marine species live near the coast too, and these man-made structures can damage the ecosystems these sea creatures depend on.\"Seventy percent of coastal structures worldwide are concrete based,\" Ido Sella, co-founder and CEO of ECOncrete, told CNN Business. Concrete can leach chemicals that turn the surrounding water more alkaline, making it hard for some marine species to survive, until the ph level of the seawater eventually returns to neutral. And the smooth, straight surfaces of structures like sea walls make it difficult for sealife like algae, oysters and barnacles to latch on. Sella's nine-year-old company makes additives that can be mixed with concrete to help it match the chemical balance of seawater. It also manufactures blocks and panels for sea defenses that mimic the shape and texture of rock formations that lie at sea level; tiny crevices on their surface give larvae a place to settle and develop, while ridged sides and shallow pockets retain water like a tide pool.Read MoreThe company's products have been installed in over 35 locations around the world over the last eight years, including in New York City, Rotterdam and Monaco. Sella, who is a marine ecologist, said that the products can more than double the amount of biodiversity, compared to traditional concrete. This allows the \"next generation\" of organisms to develop on the surface and attracts other marine life, Sella added, kickstarting a self-sustaining ecosystem. ECOncrete armor blocks mimic the shape and surface texture of underwater rocks to help sea life latch onto the surface.Lowering emissionsApart from harming ocean life, cement \u2014 the material that binds the concrete mix together \u2014 is responsible for up to 8% of the world's carbon emissions, according to think tank Chatham House. ECOncrete says its additives lower the amount of cement needed in the concrete mix, reducing its carbon footprint. But some ecologists warn that man-made structures cannot replicate the full ecological benefits of natural shorelines. Beth Strain, a researcher at the University of Tasmania who has trialed ECOncrete products, has studied the impact of different eco-engineering approaches on coastal biodiversity.How 3D printing could help save Hong Kong's coral\"Wherever possible, you should try to avoid building more artificial structures,\" Strain said.In situations where coastlines need more fortified barriers, she recommended a \"hybrid\" approach, incorporating both eco-friendly infrastructure and natural buffers against wave power, like mangrove forests or oyster reefs. \"There's quite a bit of evidence to suggest that they work just as effectively under some conditions as artificial structures by themselves,\" Strain said. \"They're also a lot more cost effective.\"However, Strain added that nature-based solutions require a lot of space and can take years to mature. 'Positive results'In densely-populated coastal cities surrounded by sea, ECOncrete's technology is an attractive eco-engineering solution, according to Kenneth Leung, a Hong Kong University professor of water ecology.In 2018, Leung's team installed ECOncrete's tide pools, armor blocks and sea wall panels on sites on Hong Kong's coast, as part of a government-funded trial to boost biodiversity on artificial shorelines.\"So far, we've had very positive results,\" Leung said, adding that in a region vulnerable to strong waves and flooding, concrete alternatives must be durable enough to meet safety regulations and last \"20 or 30 years at least.\"ECOncrete says that  when installed along the shoreline, its technology can help reverse the damage to marine life caused by humans building by the sea.Sella, who is based in Tel Aviv, said that organisms living on the surface of ECOncrete can make the structures stronger over time. As they settle on the surface, they encase the concrete in a layer of calcium carbonate, one of the main components of seashells, which stops the concrete from cracking, and can increase its tensile strength tenfold, according to Sella. Although the material is up to 15% more expensive than standard concrete, Sella said this \"bio-protection\" saves developers money in the long run, as infrastructure requires less maintenance. ECOncrete \u2014 which raised $5 million in funding last year, including from impact investment fund Bridges Israel and Barclays \u2014 produces its products in Israel, Europe and the United States, but Sella plans to open more manufacturing facilities around the world, and double his 39-person team in the next six months. Sella expects demand to rise, as developers look for ways to ways to protect shorelines from increasingly regular extreme weather events.  \"Taking into account that we're now in an era of a shifting climate with predictions of rising sea levels and increased storminess, we need to armor our shoreline in a better way,\" Sella said. \"We need to keep those resources available for the next generation.\"",

But she's no ordinary farmer, and these aren't ordinary animals.  Chua and her partner, Phua Jun Wei, founded startup Insectta in 2017. They are battling Singapore's food waste crisis with the help of an unlikely ally: the black soldier fly larva.\u202f\"The concept behind Insectta is that nothing goes to waste,\" said Chua. \"Waste can be reimagined as a resource if we change how we think about our production methods, and how we deal with waste.\"In 2020, Singapore generated 665,000 metric tons of food waste \u2014 only 19% of which was recycled.

While there are plenty of companies using insects to manage waste, including Goterra, Better Origin and AgriProtein, Insectta is extracting more than agricultural products from black soldier flies. With funding from Trendlines Agrifood Fund and government grants, Insectta is procuring high-value biomaterials from the byproducts of these larvae. \"During R&D, we realized that a lot of precious biomaterials that already have market value can be extracted from these flies,\" Chua told CNN Business. The startup hopes its biomaterials can revolutionize the growing insect-based product industry and change the way we look at waste.  The larvae can eat up to four times their body weight in food waste a day.Bugs to biomaterialsAs the maggots grow into adults, they form a cocoon, emerging about 10 to 14 days later as a fully-grown fly. Insectta has developed proprietary technology to obtain biomaterials from the exoskeleton they leave behind. This startup is creating 'real' dairy, without cowsOne of these biomaterials is chitosan, an antimicrobial substance with antioxidant properties sometimes used in cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. Insectta aims to eventually produce 500 kilograms of chitosan a day and is now collaborating with Singapore-based Spa Esprit Group for the use of its chitosan in its moisturizers.   Insectta is also collaborating with face mask brand Vi-Mask, which hopes to use black soldier fly chitosan to make an antimicrobial layer within its products.Currently, Vi-Mask uses chitosan from crab shells in the lining of its face masks. The company says that the switch to insect-based chitosan is an environmentally friendly move, as Insectta's chitosan is more sustainably sourced. A more sustainable sourceAt present, crab shells are one of the primary sources for chitosan, according to Thomas Hahn, a researcher with the Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology IGB in Germany. Hahn has studied insect-based chitosan production with chemical engineer and biologist Susanne Zibek. According to Zibek, chitosan could replace synthetic thickeners and preservatives in cosmetics.  The first products made with Insectta's chitosan are currently in development. Chua says the startup is now looking for further collaborations within the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.Chitosan extraction from shellfish involves chemical processes and large amounts of water. Chua said that Insectta's extraction techniques involve fewer chemicals, like sodium hydroxide, than traditional extraction processes, making it a more sustainable alternative. Zibek said the insect biomaterial market will grow as companies look to lower their environmental impact. \"There's a change in consumer awareness, and people want sustainable products,\" she added. \"We can support that by substituting synthetic products with chitosan.\"Overcoming the 'gross factor'To widen the market for its black soldier fly materials, Insectta needs to challenge the stigma against insects.\"When people think of maggots, the first thing they think is that they're gross and harmful to people,\" Chua said. \"By putting the benefits first, we can transform people's 'gross factor.'\"Chua says black soldier flies do not bite and they grow very quickly, making the insects ideal for urban farming.There is ongoing scientific debate about the consciousness of insects. But Phua said rearing black soldier flies is more humane and sustainable than rearing livestock, as insects need less water, energy and space to grow.Rather than running its own farms, however, Insectta plans to sell eggs to local black soldier fly farms, and collect exoskeletons produced by these farms to then extract the biomaterials.\"We not only want insects to feed the world,\" Phua added, \"we want insects to power the world.\"",

California-based Perfect Day uses fungi to make dairy protein that is \"molecularly identical\" to the protein in cow's milk, says co-founder Ryan Pandya. That means it can be used to make dairy products such as cheese and yogurt.\"We were interested in the question of what is in milk ... that gives it incredible versatility and nutrition that is somehow missing from the plant-based milks,\" says Pandya. Perfect Day has assembled the gene that codes for whey protein in cow's milk, and introduced it into a fungus. When the fungus is grown in fermentation tanks, it produces whey protein, which is then filtered and dried into a powder used in products including cheese and ice cream \u2014 which are already on the shelves in the United States and Hong Kong.\"[It's for] people who still love dairy, but want to feel better about it for themselves, for the planet, and for the animal,\" says Pandya.  Read MoreFermented fungi Although Perfect Day's protein contains no lactose, hormones or cholesterol, it isn't suitable for people with a dairy allergy. But as the process involves no animals, Pandya describes the product as \"vegan-friendly.\" It's also good for the environment. By removing cows from the equation, the production of milk is \"dramatically more efficient,\" says Pandya, producing up to 97% fewer greenhouse gas emissions than conventional dairy.

A rapidly growing marketPerfect Day isn't the only company looking to science for sustainable dairy solutions. California startup New Culture is also developing cheese products without cows through a fermentation process, and TurtleTree Labs is creating milk \u2014 including human milk \u2014 from cultured cells.

        "content": "(CNN Business)Garden peas are sometimes an afterthought on our dinner plates. But one Scottish farm-based distillery is reimagining the humble legume as the star ingredient in its eco-friendly gin. Arbikie Highland Estate in Arbroath has created a line of spirits called N\u00e0dar (\"nature\" in Gaelic) which removes more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than it emits, making it \"climate-positive,\" says Kirsty Black, master distiller at Arbikie. Spirits are usually made by fermenting grains such as wheat or barley, cereal crops that typically require synthetic fertilizers. By using peas instead of wheat for the base spirit, Arbikie avroids the carbon emissions and pollution created by synthetic fertilizers. Then, after distillation, residual pea by-products are then used to make high-protein animal feed, with zero waste. Black says consumers are increasingly interested in sustainably produced spirits, and hopes that N\u00e0dar will introduce other producers to the opportunities.Peas don't need fertilizingRead MoreThe production of synthetic fertilizers is energy intensive, says Felicity Crotty, a senior lecturer at the Royal Agricultural University in London. A 2017 study found that 43% of a loaf of bread's carbon footprint came from the ammonium nitrate used to grow the wheat.Without fertilizers, most plants are unable to get the nitrogen they need \u2014 yet legumes such as peas and lentils have a \"symbiotic relationship with bacteria\" which helps them remove nitrogen from the air and feed the plant, Crotty tells CNN Business. Photos: The sustainable spirits shaking up the drinks industryArbikie Distillery says its pea-based gin is the world's first \"climate positive\" gin. A life-cycle analysis found it removes 1.54 kilograms of CO2 from the atmosphere per bottle by not using synthetic fertilizers and utilizing the leftover peas as high-protein animal feed -- meaning the process of making each bottle absorbs more carbon than it emits.

It's already being used by eco-conscious bars, such as Penicillin in Hong Kong, named \"Asia's most sustainable bar.\"Hide Caption 9 of 9Peas fertilize other cropsUsing organic produce to grow grains for distilling would also remove the emissions associated with synthetic fertilizers. However, organic farms currently make up just 1.5% of agricultural land use, representing a tiny fraction of food production.Not only do legumes not need fertilizing, they can be planted alongside other crops, leaving the soil richer in nitrogen and reducing the need for those crops to be fertilized too. That's what Arbikie is doing. One of the downsides of using peas instead of wheat is that the crop occupies 112% more space than the equivalent amount of wheat. But as well as a distillery, Arbikie is a working farm, where peas were already grown alongside other plants to add nitrogen to the soil. By producing gin, it has come up with a high-value use for peas that would otherwise go to waste.Pea waste can become animal feedThe residual pea waste is also turned into animal feed, which eliminates carbon emissions associated with feed production, such as land clearing, cultivation and transportation.All of these sustainable actions add up. Analysis of the gin determined that the production of each bottle of N\u00e0dar gin removes 1.54 kg CO2 equivalent from the atmosphere.This Singapore startup is using insects to turn trash into treasureNow, from a family-run farm in Scotland, the N\u00e0dar range \u2014 which also includes a climate-positive vodka \u2014 is quickly becoming available around the globe through partnerships with luxury hospitality groups such as Aman Resorts, Four Seasons, and Rosewood Hotels.

Since 2016, the number of gin distilleries has more than doubled.

        "content": "London (CNN Business)The Indian start-up Cure.fit began in 2016 as a fitness app like many others, offering gym memberships and exercise classes to young adults in Bangalore. But it has since transformed into one of India's top health platforms, with meal and grocery deliveries, online workouts, mindfulness classes, appointments at its health centers and even an online store for fitness gear. The spread of coronavirus spurred the business to further reinvent itself, from one primarily reliant on physical gyms to an international online fitness platform.This summer Cure.fit announced its digital expansion into the US, where it has begun offering online fitness and therapy sessions.\"Lockdown has expedited these efforts,\" Shamik Sharma, Cure.fit's head of international business, tells CNN Business. \"When we saw the demand for our app in the United States, we launched rapidly,\" he adds.Read MoreQuick reaction to Covid-19 Like businesses all over the world, Cure.fit was forced to re-strategize in response to the pandemic. It shut the doors to all of its 250 plus fitness and health centers in March, when India locked down parts of the country. So far, it has reopened 30 centers, in compliance with government regulations, with more scheduled to open in the coming months. But some centers are expected to close permanently, says the company.It has had to cut jobs and furlough workers \u2014 Cure.fit declined to comment on the number of staff affected, but Reuters and TechCrunch have reported that at least 800 employees have been laid off in the past few months. In the same May report, Reuters pegged Cure.fit's staff count at 5,000 across India, citing an anonymous source.Before lockdown Cure.fit operated eight health clinics in Bangalore, offering check-ups, diagnosis and prescription services. These will reopen once government regulation allows. The company, which has raised more than $400 million in funding, was at risk of coming to a complete standstill \u2014 before March, at least 60% of Cure.fit's revenues were generated by its physical fitness studios, according to the company. Instead, lockdown has accelerated the company's pivot to online.\"When our gyms closed, we immediately knew that our customers would miss in-person classes so we created live classes through our app,\" says Sharma.The Cure.fit app hosts more than 200,000 sessions daily in India, with instructor-led online classes ranging from strength to pilates, cardio and yoga. During the pandemic, this platform has thrived. Since the start of India's lockdown, the company says it has signed up 1.5 million users in the country and amassed 100,000 paid subscribers since launching a paywall in May. In the US, the company has reported 75,000 downloads since testing for the app began in May. Cure.fit currently offers its live sessions there for free, but plans to introduce a subscription model by the end of the year. India's healthcare appsWhile the virus has prompted more interest in healthcare apps, India already had a well-developed market. Pre-pandemic, the market for such apps was projected to grow in value from 27 billion rupees ($360 million) in 2018 to 138 billion rupees ($1.8 billion) by 2024, according to a report from Netscribes, an India-based technology and market research firm. This is primarily credited to technological advances, including falling device and mobile data costs, says Lalatendu Sahoo, a senior consultant at Netscribes.Cure.fit appeals to young adults who are embracing a wholesome and healthy lifestyle. \"People are also becoming more and more health conscious,\" says Sahoo, particularly younger generations living in big cities. \"They are more familiar with the internet, they're more comfortable with mobile devices ... and they are really trying to add the wellness factor into their day-to-day life,\" he adds.Cure.fit wanted to attract this millennial market by selling a whole lifestyle through its range of food, therapy and fitness services. \"The idea was to build a one-stop solution for anything health and wellness,\" Ankit Nagori, who co-founded Cure.fit with Mukesh Bansal, tells CNN Business. \"We want to build a community of fitness enthusiasts who would like to lead a healthy lifestyle and promote healthy living,\" he adds.",

But when the pandemic hit and Singapore announced its lockdown, the restaurant's future was thrown into doubt.Unlike many other establishments, Saint Pierre did not have a food delivery system in place. Its fine dining was designed to be experienced in house \u2014 with every plate delivered fresh from the kitchen and presented as a work of art, rather than on the back of a moped.   To survive, head chef and owner Emmanuel Stroobant knew this had to change. The Belgium-born chef came up with Virtual Saint Pierre, a unique experience where diners can indulge in the restaurant's cuisine \u2014 modern French with an Asian twist \u2014 while at home.

At a minimum of 180 Singapore dollars ($130) per person, these are not typical takeaways.\"We try to avoid people having to re-cook or reheat food at home. We just deliver the box and we come back after to clear it for you. It's really the same service you would have in the restaurant but at home,\" says Stroobant.Is virtual dining here to stay?The impact of coronavirus on Singapore's restaurant industry has been enormous. According to a survey by Chope, a restaurant reservation platform, 93% of restaurants on the island have seen a dip in revenue, with 80% reducing staff to cut costs.But Sherri Kimes, a professor at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration and co-author of the report, says the impact has been particularly hard on fine dining restaurants as many have never previously offered delivery or takeaway.\"They basically had three choices: develop innovative ways in which to stay in business, temporarily close or just cease operations,\" Kimes tells CNN Business. Saint Pierre overlooks Singapore's Marina Bay. It has now reopened in a reduced capacity, with social distancing guidelines in place. Saint Pierre is not the only high-end eatery to choose the first option: 28 HongKong Street is inviting guests to join online house parties as cocktails and canap\u00e9s are delivered to their doors, and the three-Michelin-starred restaurant Odette is offering home deliveries of its signature dishes from black truffle tart to blue lobster.Such virtual offerings are expected to outlive the pandemic. One survey by Nielsen found that more than 60% of consumers in China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, South Korea and Vietnam plan to eat at home more. \"People still want to go out for dinner, but uneasiness with the safety of going out and restrictions on party size will still make virtual dining popular,\" says Kimes. She adds that though dine-in business is still allowed in Singapore there are capacity restraints, so many restaurants are developing their delivery and virtual offerings. They have \"discovered new revenue streams that they hadn't considered in the past,\" she says. Stroobant agrees. Without its virtual dining experience, Saint Pierre would have shut down and the staff would have lost their jobs, he says.  \"We wanted to go and get out of this undamaged,\" he adds.",

With the Summer Olympics due to be hosted in Tokyo, the island nation expected 40 million tourists to grace its shores.But when Covid-19 took hold, the Olympics were postponed and the already struggling economy took a further battering. With bars and restaurants suffering a significant reduction in business, beer sales in Japan dropped 26% by volume for the first half of the year, according to Bloomberg.That's a big problem for small beer breweries, says Isamu Yoneda, head distiller at artisanal drinks maker Kiuchi Brewery. With few customers in its brewpubs, and export orders canceled, Kiuchi Brewery was left with a stockpile of spoiling beer. The company had to come up with a solution \u2014 and decided to turn the unsold beer into a different alcoholic beverage.Read MoreIn April, Kiuchi Brewery launched the \"Save Beer Spirits\" campaign at its Tokyo distillery, offering local bars and breweries the chance to turn unused beer, a product with a four to six-month shelf life, into gin \u2014 a product without an expiration date.A mission to save beerIn 1994, Japan relaxed its strict laws around microbrewing, sparking a boom in craft beer.

It has been making its signature Hitachino Nest craft beer for 24 years.Yoneda says that turning beer into spirits isn't a new innovation. Kiuchi Brewery has been using beer to make plum wine liqueur for years, and has experimented with gin liqueurs in the past.Most gins are made with a base of grains like barley, rye or wheat, which are fermented into a mash, then distilled into a high-proof \"neutral\" spirit. The spirit is then distilled a second time with juniper berries and other botanicals, which add flavor. The beer replaces this neutral spirit, skipping the mash and fermentation process, and jumping straight to distillation. Kiuchi Brewery asked participating bars to send in a minimum of 20 liters of unused beer, which would be sent back as gin, says Yoneda. Kiuchi can produce eight liters of gin from every 100 liters of beer. It then sends back the gin as a standard 750ml bottle of gin or as a sparkling gin cocktail, either in cans or in a keg for bars to use in their taps. Gin is distilled in copper stills. The stills used by Kiuchi Brewery have a \"swan neck\" design. Yoneda says the beer base makes the gin bitter, but in addition to juniper berries, Kiuchi uses sansho peppers, lemons and mikan (Japanese oranges), which helps to \"balance out the bitterness\" with \"citrusy notes.\"The bars only have to shoulder the cost of delivery, with Kiuchi Brewery offering its distillation service free of charge. \"In these troublesome times, it is our responsibility to offer this service to everyone,\" says Yoneda. \"Most importantly, we want to keep the breweries and bar community alive.\" A sustainable spiritKiuchi isn't the only brewery using beer to make gin. The Ethical Spirits & Co was founded in February 2020 to help sake distillers turn leftover sake lees into new spirits, says co-founder Chikara Ono. When the pandemic hit and beer sales plummeted, Ono says the company began exploring new recipes to make gin from beer.Revive gin is made with Budweiser beer, and flavored with lemon peel, beech wood, cinnamon and san'ont\u014d, a dark, sweet sugar. In May, they received a donation of 20,000 liters of expiring Budweiser from drinks giant AB InBev, who had a surplus of stock due to a drop in beer sales. The startup used the beer to create 4,500 bottles of gin.\"We had a problem of excess inventory and Ethical Spirits had the knowledge and the right ethos to create a product that we mutually thought would be a positive impact,\" says Takahiro Shimada, head of marketing for AB InBev Japan, adding that the company wanted to support local businesses. The Ethical Spirits & Co is still in the process of building its own distillery in Tokyo, scheduled to open in December, so they collaborated with Gekkeikan sake distillery to distil the Budweiser. The beer-based gin initiatives are tapping into a rapidly emerging market. Beam Suntory purchased British craft gin makers Sipsmith in 2016, and launched its first Japanese craft gin, Roku, the following year. Japan's first dedicated gin distillery opened just four years ago in Kyoto, but the gin market is already estimated to be worth $209 million and is anticipated to grow by 4.4% annually over the next three years. Large drinks companies, including Japanese whisky giants Suntory and Nikka, have helped launch Japanese craft gin onto the international stage.Drinking trends in Japan are pointing towards gin sodas and ready-to-drink canned cocktails, creating an opportunity for creative spirit producers to sustainably reuse surplus drink stock, says Ono. \"If you can essentially use unused or remaining ingredients to create something special and something premium, that's great. It follows with our vision of trying to achieve a sustainable, circular economy,\" says Ono.",

        "content": "(CNN Business)When the Covid-19 pandemic made face masks an everyday essential, Japanese startup Donut Robotics spotted an opportunity. They created a smart mask \u2014 a high-tech upgrade to standard face coverings, designed to make communication and social distancing easier.In conjunction with an app, the C-Face Smart mask can transcribe dictation, amplify the wearer's voice, and translate speech into eight different languages.The cutouts on the front are vital for breathability, so the smart mask doesn't offer protection against the coronavirus. Instead, it is designed to be worn over a standard face mask, explains Donut Robotics CEO Taisuke Ono. Made of white plastic and silicone, it has an embedded microphone that connects to the wearer's smartphone via Bluetooth. The system can translate between Japanese and Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Indonesian, English, Spanish and French.Donut Robotics first developed the translation software for a robot called Cinnamon \u2014 but when the pandemic hit, the robot project was put on hold. That's when the team's engineers came up with the idea to use their software in a face mask. Donut Robotics CEO Taisuke Ono tests out the communication robot prototype, Cinnamon, at Tokyo's Haneda Airport in 2017.An appealing robotRead MoreDonut Robotics started life in a garage in Kitakyushu City, in Fukuoka prefecture, in 2014.Ono co-founded the company with engineer Takafumi Okabe with the aim to \"change the world with small and mobile communication robots.\"With venture capital investment, the duo applied to Haneda Robotics Lab \u2014 an initiative that sought robots to provide services for visitors at Tokyo's Haneda Airport.According to a spokesperson for Haneda Robotics Lab, robots fill a need as Japan's declining workforce will make it harder to recruit human staff.Donut Robotics' Cinnamon robot \u2014 designed to provide tourists with useful information and help them to navigate the airport \u2014 was one of four translation robot prototypes selected by the project in 2016. Haneda Robotics Lab says Cinnamon beat the competition because of its appealing aesthetics and user-friendly design, and because the translation software performed well in noisy environments. The smart mask translates between Japanese and eight languages. This success prompted the company to relocate to Tokyo and take on three new team members.Ono says the Donut Robotics software uses machine learning developed with the help of translation experts and specializes in the Japanese language. He claims that \"the technology is better than Google API, or other popular technologies\" for Japanese language users, because most competitor apps focus on translating to and from English. The team started testing a prototype at Haneda Airport in 2017 and continued developing the technology.But earlier this year, Covid-19 hit Asia and the airport project ground to a halt. \"We were running short of money and wondering how to keep the company going,\" says Ono. The team sought a solution and came up with the idea to adapt its software for a product that would sell well in a pandemic. A quickly growing marketThe coronavirus pandemic has led to a boom in face mask sales, with mask-wearing in public now mandated in many countries around the world.Seeing an opportunity to monetize their translation technology, Donut Robotics launched a fundraiser on Japanese crowdfunding platform Fundinno in June. They raised 28 million yen ($265,000) in 37 minutes, says Ono. \"It was very surprising,\" he says, \"because it would usually take three or four months to get that kind of money.\" Masks were commonly used in Japan even before the pandemic. Now their use is widespread.A second round of crowdfunding on Fundinno in July raised a further 56.6 million yen ($539,000), which Ono plans to use to develop translation software for the international market. To scale up production, Donut Robotics have partnered with a company in Tokyo, which they declined to name.Ono says the first wave of distribution is expected to take place in Japan, with 5,000 to 10,000 masks available by December. They will be priced at $40 to $50, he says, with an extra subscription for the app. Donut Robotics will not expand overseas until April 2021 at the earliest, but there has been interest in the UK and US, where they plan to crowdfund on Kickstarter, says Ono.The mask's Bluetooth chip can connect to smartphones up to 32 feet (10 meters) away, says Ono. He hopes the mask will make new social distancing norms in locations including hospitals and offices easier, by enabling good communication. \"We still have many situations where we have to meet in person,\" he says. \"In this new normal ... the mask and the app are very helpful.\"",

        "content": "(CNN Business)Before the pandemic, there were many reasons to be anxious about taking an elevator \u2014 from being crammed in a small space with strangers, to getting stuck between floors.Now, as coronavirus cases exceed 18 million worldwide, many people are concerned about catching the virus, whether from someone else in the elevator or via the buttons.Software engineer Bhavin Ahir felt the fear in the apartment block where he lives in March, when the Indian government implemented what would become a four-month lockdown.Ahir lives on the 12th floor of a 13-floor apartment block in the western state of Gujarat. The tower block is home to hundreds of people who take the elevator multiple times each day.\"There is always fear to touch the buttons, so I decided to do some developments from that side,\" says Ahir, the founder of Indian electronics company, TechMax Solution.People worldwide are finding ways to avoid touching elevator buttons. This man in Tehran is using toothpicks.Read MoreUnable to leave his apartment, he set to work in his spare room, creating prototypes for a product now known as \"Sparshless\" (sparsh means touch in Sanskrit).The system consists of a panel that is fitted alongside existing elevator buttons. It allows users to select a floor by pointing their finger at each button from a distance of 10 to 15 millimeters (0.4 to 0.6 inches), triggering an infrared signal which tells the elevators where they want to go. Sparshless units are also mounted at elevator entrances on each floor, says Ahir. Users place their hands under the arrows on the unit to indicate whether they want to travel up or down. It's a completely contactless system designed for a world where people have become cautious about everything they touch.Dirtier than a toilet seat We've long known that elevator buttons are dirty. Studies have found more bacteria on elevator buttons than toilet seats.Modeling shows that the risk of catching the virus from people traveling in elevators is relatively low, as the cars are typically well-ventilated and passengers spend a short time inside.However, as the virus is believed to survive on some surfaces for up to 72 hours, it's not surprising that people feel anxious about touching buttons.The pandemic has led to some creative solutions. In Thailand, a shopping mall has installed pedals so patrons can choose their floor with their feet. And in Japan, one toothpick company is marketing \"noncontact sticks\" for pressing the buttons. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people avoid touching the buttons directly and instead \"use an object (such as a pen cap) or their knuckle.\"In India, Ahir sought more sophisticated technology. At a shopping mall in Bangkok, a woman uses a foot pedal to choose her floor.Making the product Ahir usually works from his company's office in the city of Surat, where he employs 12 permanent staff. The 31-year-old entrepreneur started his business, TechMax Solution, in 2009, straight after graduating from college. The company's key products are security devices, but during India's four-month lockdown, work dried up. During that time \"we didn't raise even one rupee,\" he says.Ahir responded to the crisis by developing the Sparshless system, testing the first prototypes on his neighbors. Early models were adjusted when he discovered that daylight triggered false readings. The system also needed to be installed in such a way that it didn't affect the elevators' normal workings \u2014 or warranty. With those problems solved, the next step was finding customers. That hasn't been easy during a nationwide lockdown, says Ahir, but so far, the units have been fitted in 15 buildings in India.Users call lifts fitted with Sparshless by placing their hand under a unit equipped with infrared transmitters.Sumit and Sushila Katariya live in one of those buildings. Sumit is an elevator consultant, and Sushila is a doctor at Medanta Hospital, southwest of Delhi, who has treated hundreds of coronavirus patients since March. Sumit Katariya had the touchless buttons installed in the personal elevator at his two-story housing complex to reduce the risk of this wife infecting the family and their visitors, if she caught the virus. He says the panel has been working \"perfectly fine\" since they had it installed about one month ago. Ahir says he has received inquiries from Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Brazil about the panels. He hopes to sell up to 1,500 units by the end of the year, an ambitious target for a small company with one manufacturing facility in the country with the world's third highest number of coronavirus cases. It's a \"tough situation\" he says, but \"I always think positive.\"",

        "content": "London (CNN Business)Ocean-based industries are growing fast, boosting demand for data on conditions at sea. But the huge research vessels that typically map the seas often come at great financial and environmental cost.Irish startup XOCEAN has floated an alternative. Its uncrewed surface vessels (USV) \u2014 about the size of an average car and half the weight \u2014 are fitted with sensors that collect ocean data and send it via satellite to experts on shore. The company says it improves safety, while cutting the cost and emissions of ocean surveying. According to XOCEAN, its USVs emit 1,000-times less carbon than traditional research vessels.\"If nobody needs to go offshore, that removes people from a potentially hazardous environment,\" says James Ives, XOCEAN's founder and CEO. On top of that, \"(we have) a tiny environmental footprint ... and we believe we can deliver the data at a lower cost,\" he adds.\n\n\n\nXOCEAN's uncrewed surface vessel is 4.5 meters long and weighs 750kg -- about the size of an average car, and half its weight. Credit: XOCEAN \nOcean activity Read MoreXOCEAN says its growing fleet of USVs has been deployed across the world, completing 30,000 hours at sea and more than 100 projects since the company was founded in 2017. It has been used by the oil and gas industry to carry out pipeline surveys, by fisheries to collect acoustic data on fish populations, and for environmental research and monitoring. The vessels are powered by a battery charged by solar panels on deck and a small diesel generator. Equipped with sensors such as multibeam echo sounders \u2014 which send sound pulses into the water that bounce off the seabed \u2014 they are able to measure depth, air and water temperature, wind speed, wave height and tidal flows. The ocean economy is expected to be worth more than $3 trillion by 2030, according to a 2016 report from the OECD, with strong growth predicted in offshore wind, fish processing, and shipbuilding and repair. \"Data is the foundation for any activity in the ocean,\" says Ives, adding that XOCEAN has experienced a huge boom in demand. At the beginning of 2020, the company had around 20 full employees; now it has 112. It has raised roughly \u20ac8 million ($9.4 million) in funding, with offices in Ireland, the United Kingdom and Canada. Next, the company is looking to expand into Asia-Pacific, and by the end of the year plans to increase its fleet from 15 to 40 vessels. Wind farms are increasingly becoming a major source of business for XOCEAN.New interest is mostly coming from the offshore wind industry, says Ives \u2014 both from clean energy heavyweights such as \u00d8rsted, which employed XOCEAN to carry out a site survey for the world's biggest offshore wind farm, and oil and gas companies that are shifting to renewables. BP (BP) recently announced that it was using XOCEAN's USVs to survey an area in the Irish Sea for two 60-year offshore wind leases. \"We are seeing firsthand a tremendous shift in the energy markets towards a more renewable future,\" says Ives.Greener, cheaper, safer?XOCEAN isn't the only company riding this wave. There is L3Harris, whose unmanned vessels have been used by the US Navy, Saildrone which has collected data from the Arctic to the equator as part of environmental research, and Ocean Infinity, which is spearheading the development of larger uncrewed vessels. Yet proving safety to marine regulators remains a challenge. In the case of the United Kingdom, \"all regulations were written with the intention that there will be somebody onboard,\" says Katrina Kemp, autonomy technical specialist for the UK government's Maritime and Coastguard Agency, which grants permits for uncrewed vehicles to operate in national waters. USV operators have to demonstrate that their vessels have an equivalent level of safety, she says, including how the boat would react to a potential collision, or what happens if there's a technical failure or lag between the remote operator and the vessel itself. The vessel sends real time images and situational data to XOCEAN's control room.\"We have to be really confident that the plans and processes they have in place and the equipment they're using ensures that if things go wrong, the vessel is in a safe state and isn't going to endanger others,\" she tells CNN Business.XOCEAN's vessels use light detection and ranging (lidar) technology to detect nearby objects, and there is both a USV pilot and surveyor monitoring each active vessel 24 hours a day. They can control navigation if the vessel goes off course and ensure that it follows \"the rules of the road at sea,\" says Ives.Without a human on board, each watercraft can spend up to a month at sea \u2014 which means more time on data collection. It can also brave weather conditions that a crewed ship might avoid. \"We've had a vessel out in really truly horrible conditions, and we sit here in the comfort of our homes,\" says Ives.",

(CNN)It has been two years since the Covid-19 pandemic became a reality for millions of people in Europe and many of the region's leaders now believe it is time to move on. But as countries shed restrictions, cases and hospitalizations are slowly inching up and public health experts are worried about the consequences.  Covid-19 cases are rising in Britain just two weeks after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson lifted most mitigation measures. Infections were 48% higher last week compared with the one before and hospitalizations were up 17% over the same period, CNN's Brenda Goodman and Deidre McPhillips report.  The country's daily case rate -- about 55,000 a day -- is still less than a third of what it was during the Omicron peak, but cases are rising as fast as they were falling just two weeks earlier, when self-isolation rules for infected people ended in the UK.  Daily cases are also rising in more than half of the countries in the European Union. They have jumped 48% in the Netherlands. On Tuesday, Germany reported a record high seven-day incidence in Covid-19 cases, of 1,585.4 Covid-19 infections per 100,000 people, days before the government is due to consider easing some restrictions. The situation has caught the eye of American public health experts, who worry that Europe's rise in infections may be a preview of what's to come in the US. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN that his British counterparts have pegged the rise in cases to a combination of three factors: The more transmissible BA.2 variant; the opening of society and people mingling more indoors without masks; and waning immunity from vaccination or prior infection.  Read More\"Without a doubt, opening up society and having people mingle indoors is clearly something that is a contributor, as well as overall waning immunity, which means we've really got to stay heads-up and keep our eye on the pattern here,\" Fauci said. \"So that's the reason why we're watching this very carefully.\" Although the UK may provide a glimpse of the future, there are key differences that will affect how BA.2 plays out in the US, Keri Althoff, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told CNN.  In the UK, 86% of eligible people are fully vaccinated, and 67% are boosted, compared with 69% of those eligible vaccinated and 50% boosted in the US. \"What we see happening in the UK is going to be perhaps a better story than what we should be expecting here,\" Althoff said.  Even though the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) did away with masking recommendations for most parts of the country two weeks ago, it is vital to stay vigilant.  \"We have to stay diligent in terms of monitoring of it and testing and be prepared to possibly reverse a lot of the relaxing of these restrictions,\" said Deborah Fuller, a microbiologist at the University of Washington.  \"We can't let our guard down, because the message that people get when they say 'we're lifting restrictions' is the pandemic is over. And it's not.\" YOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED. Q: What factors should people consider if they need to return to work in person? A: It depends on the individual and the circumstances involved, CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen said.   \"People should consider three factors. What are your medical circumstances and that of others in your household? What's the level of Covid-19 in your community? And finally what safety precautions are already being taken in your place of work?\" Wen added. \"Some offices require proof of vaccination, require regular testing, distancing, and ventilation.

READS OF THE WEEK White House warns Congress about potential disruptions to Covid response The White House is amping up its warning that aspects of the federal Covid-19 response will be curtailed after lawmakers failed to pass additional funding, with administration officials speaking in dire terms in a call with reporters and sending a letter to congressional leaders Tuesday, Betsy Klein reports.  The latest warnings mark an escalation in pressure from the Biden administration ahead of key funding deadlines. Additional funding for federal Covid-19 efforts was initially included in a recent massive omnibus spending package, but was stripped out following a spat over  how the spending would be offset. As daily cases rise in Europe, a senior Biden administration official warned that Congress' failure to pass a supplemental Covid-19 funding bill could leave the US unprepared for another potential surge. \"Our scientific and medical experts have been clear that in the next couple of months, we could see Covid cases increase here in the US just as we're seeing cases rising abroad right now,\" the senior official said, adding, \"We are less well prepared without additional funding than we would be otherwise.\" In China, 37 million people are in lockdown as the country suffers its worst outbreak since Wuhan China is battling its worst Covid-19 outbreak since the early days of the pandemic. This outbreak has spread far faster than previous waves of less infectious variants, with daily cases skyrocketing from a few dozen in February to more than 5,100 on Tuesday -- the highest figure since the early 2020 outbreak in Wuhan. While the number may sound low compared to other countries, it is alarmingly high for a nation that has adhered to a strict zero-Covid policy throughout the pandemic. Five cities -- collectively home to more than 37 million residents -- are now under varying levels of lockdown in China, Jessie Yeung reports.  Authorities and state media say it is still unclear how the first few outbreaks began. But several factors -- including cases imported from overseas and the prevalence of the Omicron variant -- exacerbated the severity of the outbreak nationwide.  Paige Deiner, who nearly died of Covid-19 in 2021, still has nerve damage from her illness. She had a near-death experience because of Covid. But it wasn't a glimpse of an afterlife that changed her In the two years since it began, the pandemic has spawned a new category of near-death experiences -- recounted by people who say they lived through them and returned to see the miraculous in the ordinary rhythms of daily life, John Blake reports.  They were spiritually transformed not by a glimpse of the afterlife but by what they saw in this life, when they were struggling to stay alive after being stricken by Covid. Those type of stories don't tend to get book or movie deals. Yet people like Paige Deiner, 41, have these incredible stories of survival that can help us all. Start with the power of gratitude. It's a clich\u00e9 for some, but not for many Covid survivors. \"I think often of how much we take for granted,\" Deiner wrote in a Facebook post not long after she was released from the hospital in December, \"from the ability to walk or swallow to breathe.\" TOP TIP Mask mandates may be lifting in many parts of the US, but many people are holding on to them in case guidance changes. Here is what you need to know to store masks safely and tell if they are expired:  Masks need to be stored in a dry area, said Christopher Sulmonte, project administrator for the Johns Hopkins Biocontainment Unit at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. \"I personally use a paper bag without sealing it, because the big thing is you want it to recirculate with air,\" he said. Store your face coverings using a plastic container with holes in it.  For cloth masks, make sure to wash them like you would any other piece of clothing you own. If you're taking a break from wearing a mask, be sure to check the expiration date, this can often be found on the outside of the boxes.

        "content": "(CNN)To many parents' dismay, a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the Covid-19 vaccine is less effective against the Omicron variant for children ages 5 to 11 than for older children and adults. Two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine reduced the risk of Omicron infection by 31% among children 5 to 11 years old, compared with 59% among those 12 to 15.As masks become optional, kids take their health into their own hands Vaccinated children ages 5 to 11 were about 46% less likely to need medical treatment for Covid-19 from an urgent care clinic or emergency department, compared with unvaccinated children, a previous CDC study found. That study also revealed vaccination appears to protect against severe disease: Out of almost 1,700 total admissions, there were 59 unvaccinated children in this age group admitted to the hospital with Covid-19, compared with just two who were vaccinated.Why is this happening? How worried should parents and caregivers be? Do the new data mean they should keep masks on their kids in school and avoid indoor extracurriculars? What are implications for kids with underlying medical conditions? And what's the update for kids under 5?To guide us through these questions, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of \"Lifelines: A Doctor's Journey in the Fight for Public Health\" and the mother of two young children.CNN: Why do you think the Covid-19 vaccine may be less effective in younger children than older children?Read MoreDr. Leana Wen: First, I want to urge everyone to keep these data in perspective. The vaccines in younger children still appear to protect against severe illness, and that's the most important reason we get vaccinated: to prevent hospitalization and death.Scientists don't know as to why the vaccine shows less effectiveness in younger kids compared with older kids and adults. The most likely explanation is that it's related to dose. The dose of the Pfizer vaccine given to 12-year-olds and above is 30 micrograms, compared with 10 micrograms for those ages 5 to 11. The higher the dose, the higher the possible side effects -- that's why a lower dose was chosen for the younger group. It's possible that this lower dose resulted in less effectiveness.There are some other explanations of the data. It's possible that by the time of the Omicron infection, so many young children had been exposed to Covid-19 that the effect of vaccination was reduced. It's also worth noting that effectiveness against symptomatic infection also wanes in adults, and that's why the CDC recommends the booster dose for all those 12 and older. Still, we can see that vaccination is still protective in this younger age group against severe illness.CNN: How worried should parents and caregivers be? Should they rethink their decisions to remove masks and allow their kids to participate in extracurricular activities and indoor playdates?Wen: The decreased protection is against symptomatic illness. It's certainly disappointing, but I don't think this alone should make them second-guess their decisions about removing masks and resuming extracurricular activities.The vaccine shows less effectiveness in younger kids compared with older kids and adults, but it still appears to protect against severe illness, CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen said.The main reason is that the level of Covid-19 is much lower in most parts of the United States compared with even a few weeks ago. In the state of Maryland, where I live, the seven-day average of daily cases was around 15,000 per 100,000 people during the peak of Omicron in January. It's now just over 2,000 per 100,000, according to the CDC. That means the risk of contracting Covid-19 is reduced more than sevenfold now compared with two months ago.Vaccines continue to provide some protection against symptomatic disease, but most importantly, it shields against severe illness. As a result, I don't think parents should have to rethink their decisions. If members of their household are vaccinated and boosted if eligible, and if they live in areas that are classified as either \"low\" or \"medium\" Covid-19 community level by CDC's new tracker, I think it's reasonable for families to allow their children to resume all pre-pandemic activities. That includes going to school without a mask and participating in extracurriculars and indoor playdates. CNN: What are implications for kids with underlying medical conditions, or children who live with adults who have them?Struggling after her son was born with disabilities, a mom learns to ask for helpWen: It's important to discuss the specific risks with your medical provider. Some people have certain medical conditions that clearly predispose them to severe illness if they contract Covid-19. Being moderately or severely immunocompromised, for example \u2014 if the child or someone in the family has cancer and is on chemotherapy, is an organ transplant recipient on immunosuppressants, or other similar conditions. There are also other conditions that make it more likely for the individual to end up in the hospital: those with advanced age or who also have multiple chronic medical problems like diabetes, obesity and lung disease, for instance.There are other medical conditions that need to be treated but that don't necessarily result in severe illness due to Covid-19. A child who has asthma would be in this category, for example. Speak with your medical provider to understand what your child's and other family members' risk of severe illness is due to Covid-19. If someone in the household faces a substantial risk for severe illness despite vaccination, you should all take additional precautions \u2014 such as continuing to wear a high-quality mask (N95, KN95, or KF94) when in indoor crowded settings.Sign up for CNN's Stress, But Less newsletter. Our six-part guide will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it. CNN: What's the latest for when vaccines will be available to children younger than 5?Wen: For children under 5, Pfizer is testing a smaller dose (3 micrograms, compared with 10 micrograms for those 5 to 11), as a three-dose vaccine. Those results are expected in April. Moderna's data are also expected in the next month or so. Its vaccine dose is higher (25 micrograms) for children 2 to 5 years old, and it's being tested as a two-dose series. Families with young children need to make the best decisions for themselves about the level of risk they are willing to take while awaiting the vaccine. Some may still wish to take additional precautions, especially if they live in areas with high Covid-19 community levels. Others may decide that the level of Covid-19 in their area is low enough, and the value of resuming pre-pandemic activities high enough, that they will resume indoor playdates and other activities they have been missing.",

        "content": "(CNN)Oregon's health department and the governors of Connecticut, Delaware and New Jersey have announced when their states will end the school mask mandate. Leaders in other states, cities and counties are also considering when to end required masking as well. The White House is also reported to be discussing an off-ramp for pandemic restrictions, although the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not yet updated its guidance on masking in schools. Should parents and caregivers be worried if their child's school is no longer going to require masks? What steps can they take if they want to continue reducing their children's risk of contracting Covid-19? How can families weigh the risk of going to school and extracurricular activities? What about kids younger than 5, who are not yet eligible to be vaccinated?To help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of \"Lifelines: A Doctor's Journey in the Fight for Public Health,\" and the mother of two young kids.CNN: A lot of parents and families are concerned \u2014 is the decision to drop mask requirements premature?Read MoreDr. Leana Wen: First, I want to clarify something \u2014 the end of a statewide mask mandate doesn't mean that a particular school will no longer require masks. And even if the school is no longer requiring masks, that doesn't mean the end of masks and that everyone should walk around maskless. To me, ending mask mandates means that masking is no longer a government-imposed requirement. It's still the choice of parents and families whether their child should be masked.What you should know about taking an at-home Covid-19 testThe reason why I don't think it's premature to have an off-ramp for school mask requirements is because unlike before, prior to vaccines, parents who want to take additional precautions can still do so. Vaccines are widely available for children ages 5 and older, and they protect very well against severe illness due to Covid-19. In addition, one-way masking protects the wearer, in particular, with a high-quality mask (N95, KN95 or KF94). Even if people around your child are not wearing masks, you could still choose for your child to mask, and that would offer some protection.CNN: For months, you've been supporting the idea of having more high-quality masks available to people. How does it make sense to drop mask mandates, while you want to upgrade the quality of masks?Wen: It's precisely because high-quality masks exist that we can move to mask-optional policies. For months, high-quality masks weren't widely available. When most people are wearing single-layer cloth masks, source control becomes very important, meaning that we wear masks to protect others as much as the mask also protects us. Now that high-quality masks are available, it allows people the choice to protect themselves. Plus, we have highly effective vaccines.CNN: Are there other tools that can help make the school environment safer, if masks are no longer required?Wen: Yes. All along I've talked about layers of protection, in the same way that we talk about layers to shield you and your kids when it's cold outside. When there is a lot of virus around \u2014 or when it's very cold \u2014 we need more layers. Layers can also replace one another.It's not just you -- we are all more forgetful during the pandemic, experts say. Here's how to fix itThe vaccine is a very powerful layer of protection because people who are vaccinated are less likely to contract Covid-19 and therefore less likely to transmit it, too. Those who want to can choose to wear a mask, which is another very powerful layer. Other layers include improved ventilation and regular testing. These are also tools that can reduce risk, in the classroom and in other situations.CNN: How should parents decide whether to keep their children masked in schools?Wen: There are three factors to consider. First, what is the medical circumstance of your child and your household? If everyone in your household is fully vaccinated and boosted if eligible, and everyone is generally healthy, the chance of severe illness from Covid-19 is very low. That's a different calculation than if your child or someone else in your home is moderately or severely immunocompromised.As state, city and county officials consider when to end mask mandates, families should consider their risk tolerance and the medical circumstances of their child and household members.Second, what is your family's tolerance of risk? Some families are trying very hard to avoid contracting Covid-19, while others are not. Third, how onerous is masking for your child? Many children have adapted very well to masking. However, it has been problematic for some. Some experts have speculated that prolonged masking may particularly impact younger children, kids with learning disabilities, and English-as-a-second-language learners. The possible effects of continued masking should be weighed against the possible benefit in your specific family's situation.CNN: My child has asthma. Is that considered a high-risk condition to keep masking?Wen: Every family has to make the right decision for them. Asthma is not a condition that predisposes to particularly severe outcomes from Covid-19. Many families with kids who have asthma will not choose to continue having their child mask, especially if they are vaccinated. Conditions that are high risk in children would primarily be being moderately or severely immunocompromised \u2014 for example, someone receiving chemotherapy for cancer.'I couldn't stop.' The pandemic is triggering eating disorders in our children There are other conditions that are more commonly associated with hospitalization in children who contract Covid-19, including obesity and diabetes. Again, families have to make individualized decisions. Many will decide that vaccination is sufficient for protection, while others may want to continue masking.CNN: What if my child doesn't want to stand out as the only kid who's wearing a mask?Wen: Consider speaking to other parents in the class. There may be other children who are still wearing masks, too. Perhaps arrangements can be made for these kids who want to be extra cautious to have certain options, for example, eating lunch in an area separate from others.CNN: What about extracurriculars? Should my child still participate in these activities?Wen: Again, it will be up to you. So many kids have lost a lot and made great sacrifices during the pandemic. As long as it makes sense for your family, I think it makes sense to prioritize returning them to as much normalcy as possible. CNN: What about kids younger than 5 years old who aren't yet eligible to be vaccinated? Should they keep masking? What if they have older siblings who now don't need to mask in schools?Wen: I'm hopeful that vaccines will soon be available for children under the age of 5. As a mom of two little kids under 5, I cannot wait until vaccines are authorized for this age group.In the meantime, I think it's reasonable to have masks still be required for children under 5 and the school and daycare staff taking care of them. After all, these kids don't have the option of getting vaccinated just yet. If masks are not required, I'd recommend keeping children masked at least until they are able to be vaccinated. The exception is if they recently contracted Covid-19. Those with recent infection probably have immune protection for a couple of months.Sign up for CNN's Stress, But Less newsletter. Our six-part guide will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it. Whether older siblings continue masking in schools will depend on the risk tolerance of the family. If the goal of the family is to avoid infection for the unvaccinated younger child, then I'd recommend that the older sibling wear a mask in school.At the end of the day, masks have to be seen just like any other intervention. There are clear benefits and some potential drawbacks. Mask mandates being lifted is out of recognition of this risk-benefit analysis. Masks aren't ending, though, and parents will be able to make an individualized decision that's best for their circumstance.",

        "content": "(CNN)When Joshua Gillespie was holed up in the hospital as a kid, where he stayed frequently in between surgeries for his rare heart condition, his best friend was a 3-and-a-half-year-old monster with red fur and a vibrant imagination. Elmo, that lovable, occasionally grating Muppet and \"Sesame Street\" stalwart since 1984, kept Gillespie company for much of his early childhood from a TV inside his hospital room. He'd watch the same tapes -- the \"Best of Elmo\" compilation, usually -- so often that his nurses had chosen their own favorite parts. Gillespie has loved the Muppets ever since he watched in awe as Elmo tap danced down a staircase like a regular Fred Astaire. So seeing the preschool-aged monster get his due among other adults who grew up with him -- this time for his feud with a rock -- has been extremely gratifying, he said.\"There's so much attention being brought to these things, which is fantastic for me just to see ... there's a whole new generation of people to grow up with it,\" he said. The cast of \"Sesame Street\" celebrated the show's 50th anniversary in 2019.The Muppets have been in our lives for more than 50 years, and they're still finding new ways to entertain us, even if it's by accident (the Elmo v. Rocco feud had been going on for years on \"Sesame Street,\" but Twitter and TikTok rediscovered it earlier this month). There's a revival of \"Fraggle Rock\" debuting this month, too, and Kermit, Fozzie and the gang have been riding the nostalgia wave to potentially host the Oscars -- fans are campaigning hard for them. (New episodes of \"Sesame Street\" currently stream on HBO Max, which, like CNN, is a part of WarnerMedia.)Sesame Street introduces family with two gay dads during Pride MonthRead MoreThe recent Muppet resurgence, Gillespie suspects, has been powered by our need for comfort and a hefty dose of positivity. Adults find their way back to the Muppets when they need their favorite frog or pig or monster most. Our cherished childhood moments are preserved in internet amber, and they're often even lovelier, wittier or wilder than we remember. And their philosophy -- that the show must go on, even when sets collapse and chicken feathers fly -- is particularly poignant in years when it feels like we're perpetually jumping through our own rings of fire while a choir of chickens cluck the \"William Tell Overture.\"Things so often go south for the Muppets. But they still, always, manage to make something enduring and silly and subtly moving. They taught us our ABCs, about love and the power of a well-timed flying fish. And they're teaching us, still, about making it through the tough times and coming out stronger -- and zanier, too. The Muppets aren't just for kidsPart of why it's so easy to return to the Muppets' oeuvre is because it still holds up -- and oftentimes, it evolves with its audience. The characters are deceptively witty, often telling jokes that fly right over the heads of younger viewers like Gonzo's beloved chicken Camilla, to be uncovered on repeat viewings. Joe Hennes, who co-leads the popular Muppet fan publication ToughPigs, has devoted much of his life to harnessing that Muppet-induced joy. His lifelong love of Jim Henson's creations has helped him find a family of likeminded fans and even landed him working for several years at Sesame Workshop, where he watched -- and sometimes contributed -- to the creation of his favorite childhood series.\"There's definitely something comforting about all of those different franchises we have loved at one point in our life, so going back to them, we get to rediscover that love, which is a beautiful thing,\" he told CNN. \"You can rediscover it at different points in your life and find new joy in it.\" Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy presented at the 2012 Oscars to great fanfare.Take Hennes -- as a kid, he fell hard for the rascally Ernie and naive Big Bird. But as he's gotten older, he better appreciates the curmudgeons of the Muppet world, like Ernie's stickler foil Bert, the dreadfully serious Sam the Eagle and eternal grouch Oscar. As he's grown up with the Muppets, he's found new wrinkles in their lore to explore on ToughPigs -- and new characters to identify with. Jennifer Garlen and Anissa Graham, academics who have edited and authored collections of essays analyzing various Muppet projects, said that part of what makes Kermit, Miss Piggy and co. so enchanting is their ability to speak to viewers young and old and affect them in different ways. 'Sesame Street' introducing new Korean American character \"Jim Henson always had his eye on narratives that could speak to people of all ages, not just children, and he never saw puppetry as merely children's entertainment,\" Garlen said in an email to CNN. \"There are levels of social commentary, comedy, metaphysics, drama, and psychology in these stories that make them speak to a very broad audience; you'll also see different things if you revisit them over many years.\"Graham, a senior lecturer in English at the University of North Alabama, said that as a kid, she picked up that the Muppets were speaking to both children and their parents and felt that style bridged a divide.\"It meant that somewhere along the line those two halves could connect,\" she told CNN in an email. That's why it's so easy to fall back in love with the Muppets after some time apart: Graham said Henson's works \"remind the grown-up audiences of the value of play and nonsense not as a by-product of nostalgia but as a part of their everyday lives.\" If we can adopt the Muppets' zany, whimsical streak ourselves, we might be better for it. Nostalgia reels us back inIf there's a Muppet moment that's gone viral on your Twitter timeline in the last few years, chances are it resurfaced because of Gillespie. He runs Muppet History, accounts across social media platforms that share rare Muppets footage -- Kermit's reference-laden performance of the Talking Heads' \"Once in a Lifetime,\" anyone? -- and behind-the-scenes factoids on his favorite felt performers and their human creators. He collects moments with collaborators at ToughPigs, Muppet Wiki and friends who got lucky on eBay and uncovered reels with old Muppet clips.Nonbinary characters like 'Gonzo-rella' are lighting up children's TV and encouraging self-acceptance\"I just think the Muppets are something so timeless,\" Gillespie said. \"And I think the reason why is they've never tried to be timely. They've always been sort of irreverent.\"The Muppets may not be the timeliest comedians, but they've always got something to say. The critically acclaimed \"Fraggle Rock\" revival that debuts on Apple TV+ this month has an environmentalist bent. Big Bird, who is canonically 6 years old, received his vaccine as soon as kids his age were eligible. Last year, \"Sesame Street\" debuted its \"ABCs of Racial Literacy\" program, in which two Black Muppets discuss race and inclusion with Elmo (that's in keeping with the origins of \"Sesame Street,\" which was created with young Black viewers in mind). \"Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock\" continues the original series' environmental spirit.The Muppets' progressivism can offend the occasional viewer, but it's part of their staying power, too. While some bits haven't aged well (a few episodes of \"The Muppet Show\" on Disney+ have a content warning), characters have rarely shied from difficult conversations about death, racism, health, homelessness and other topics kids wonder about but don't always have the words to dictate. As animated as the Muppets can be, they're also mirrors for viewers to better understand themselves. Frankie Cordero, a puppeteer who plays Rudy on \"Sesame Street\" and Purple Panda on the PBS series \"Donkey Hodie,\" said he related to Gonzo, an oddball whose origins are probed in the film \"Muppets from Space.\" As a person of mixed Puerto Rican, Mexican and Spanish heritage, he often felt othered by his young peers, much like Gonzo is (though the Muppet finds a family with Kermit and the gang).\"This was an incredibly diverse group that would work to stick together as a team to defeat huge obstacles in their world,\" Cordero said. The jokes grabbed his attention as a kid, but it's the characterization that kept him as a fan -- and helped him determine that he wanted to make a career in puppetry. Henson's characters are good at evolving to stay relevant, but they're still themselves, forever the ages they were when they debuted. Cookie Monster will forever hunger for his favorite dessert, just like the Count will forever obsess over numbers, and Kermit will forever flail his gangly green arms when he's excited, peeved or overwhelmed. \"The Muppets are always going to be the Muppets,\" Hennes said. \"They'll always have that opportunity to surprise us with something new or bring back that feeling of joy.\"The Muppets teach us how to keep goingThere's an appropriate metaphor for the last two years of destruction and disorder in the finale of \"The Muppet Movie.\" The final minutes see Kermit and his newfound family of weirdos finally making the film of their dreams. The cast breaks into a reprise of \"Rainbow Connection,\" and just when things seem stable, if a bit stale, the set comes crashing down. Things explode, Gonzo's hanging onto a balloon for dear life, and then, just when all seems lost, a real rainbow finds its way through a gaping hole in the studio roof. The Muppets bask in its glow while the pieces of their would-be film lay strewn around them. \"Life's like a movie -- write your own ending,\" Kermit sings. \"Keep believing, keep pretending, we've done just what we've set out to do.\" Elmo is always 3, but he's evolved with his viewers. The Muppets cobbled together a film out of debris and chaos -- one could say they thrive on chaos (that's kind of Animal's whole M.O.), or have at least found a way to work through it. Revisiting their funniest pratfalls or most touching musical numbers through older, hardened eyes returns to us \"a bit of hope,\" Gillespie said. Elmo was Gillespie's constant companion while he recovered from heart surgeries. Now, Elmo's a hero among Gillespie's peers once again for standing up against a pet rock who took the last oatmeal raisin cookie. And the cycle continues.\"Right now we need that comfort ... that things are gonna be okay, because, well, Kermit the Frog says it's gonna be okay, I think it's gonna be okay then,\" he said. \"I think it's gonna be all right.\"",

        "content": "Hong Kong (CNN)Morgues are nearly at capacity, hospitals overwhelmed and, as fears grow of a citywide lockdown, panicked shoppers have stripped supermarket shelves bare. Hong Kong -- once lauded as a zero-Covid success story -- is now battling a deadly outbreak reminiscent of the early days of the pandemic, despite having had more than two years to prepare.With locally transmitted cases surging past 312,000 in the city of 7.4 million in just the last two weeks, hospitals and embattled health workers have been stretched to breaking point. The numbers are likely to be far higher due to suspicions people are not reporting their positive test results for fear of being separated from families and put into government isolation facilities. Although the rampant surge has been driven by the less deadly Omicron variant, Hong Kong's deaths are also rising -- particularly among the city's unvaccinated elderly. According to Our World in Data, which uses data from Johns Hopkins University, Hong Kong reported more deaths per million people in the week to March 3 than any country or territory. Empty shelves at a grocery store in Hong Kong on March 1, 2022.A pedestrian crosses a near empty street in Hong Kong on February 24, 2022.The city's leader Carrie Lam said the city is facing an \"unprecedented challenge\" and insists nobody could have predicted the latest wave. But according to Hong Kong University clinical virologist Siddharth Sridhar, the situation was a \"predictable and preventable disaster.\"Read MoreFor two years, as the pandemic raged around the world, Hong Kong largely contained the virus, and there was a growing feeling the city might keep the virus out forever. As cases rose this year, the government reimposed its strictest rules, limiting public gatherings to two, closing restaurants and bars after 6 p.m., and roping off public playgrounds. But it still wasn't enough. With few other levers to pull, the government plans to launch a mandatory mass testing drive in an attempt to purge the city of Covid. Schools will break for summer early and be repurposed as isolation, testing and vaccination facilities. And it's still unclear whether a citywide lockdown is on the cards. \"March is going to be a very, very difficult time,\" said Sridhar. \"(It's) definitely an unprecedented health crisis for Hong Kong.\"For a city that has already put up with two years of tough restrictions, news of citywide testing has proved too much for some residents who are frantically looking for a flight out. And while vaccines mean Hong Kong is better off than it would have been two years ago, immunization rates are still lagging among its elderly population -- meaning many of the city's most vulnerable are still unprotected. What went wrong in Hong KongAt Queen Elizabeth, one of Hong Kong's largest hospitals, patients sit in a sparse, windowless observation room while they wait for a bed in an isolation ward. Two nurses, who asked not to be named because they fear repercussions for speaking out, told CNN last week the observation room smells of feces -- there are no restrooms, so patients are forced to use bedpans.The nurses say staff shortages mean there's often a delay in checking on patients as more arrive for care, and there are too many people wanting treatment and not enough beds.

The situation is hopeless.\" The hospital's morgue is overflowing and some bodies are being stored for hours at room temperature, according to one of the nurses.A medicine and geriatrics doctor at another hospital in Hong Kong, who asked not to be named as she fears repercussions, said the sheer number of patients was \"astounding,\" with some waiting up to four days to be seen by a doctor. \"It's so packed and spread so thin for manpower, you have like one nurse seeing 20 patients,\" she said last week. \"What we're seeing here is nothing I've ever seen before.\"Covid-19 patients seen laying on beds outside the Caritas Medical Center in Hong Kong.

With a sharp increase in Covid-19 deaths due to the cold weather, the \"storage space in hospital mortuaries has reached full capacity,\" the statement said.In a briefing Tuesday, health officials said they are adding refrigerated containers and expediting the construction of a new mortuary to provide at least 800 extra units. To date, Hong Kong has recorded 1,554 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic, up from 213 at the end of December 2021.Covid patients outside the Caritas Medical Centre in Hong Kong on February 25, 2022.A Covid patient on a stretcher outside the Caritas Medical Centre in Hong Kong on February 25, 2022. That surge in cases is also putting pressure on hospital wards.Previously, all Covid positive cases were placed in hospital, and any close contacts into government-run quarantine -- even if they were asymptomatic. But with soaring cases, it became no longer feasible to quarantine all positive cases and close contacts. \"Our healthcare system is at the edge of collapse,\" the Hong Kong Doctors Union said in an open letter in February.But some positive cases are desperate to be admitted to government-run facilities, no matter how sick they are, because for much of the pandemic they've been told that's the right thing to do, Hong Kong University professor Jin Dong-yan said. That's not only putting pressure on the system, he said, but is exposing others to infection.\"They just hang around, come to this or that hospital, just hoping to be admitted,\" he said last month. \"They might spread the virus to others.\"The situation is also being exacerbated by Hong Kong's high proportion of unvaccinated people.People really started to believe that even the miniscule risk associated with vaccination was higher than the risk of CovidKaren Grepin, University of Hong KongAs of this week, 78% of the population -- excluding those aged 3 to 11 -- are double vaccinated, but just 48% of people aged 70 or older have received two doses. At the start of this year, just 25% of people age 80 or over had been vaccinated. On Friday, government officials said vaccinating the elderly was now a public health priority, describing care homes as \"hot spots\" for the virus. And as of Friday, the wait time between the first and second doses of the Chinese-made Sinovac shot would be reduced from 28 days to 21 days for the elderly. The low vaccination rate among the elderly appears to be playing out in the city's death toll. Almost all of the city's Covid-19 deaths reported this year are elderly and unvaccinated -- and many of them lived in care homes. Stephanie Law, an executive committee member from the Elderly Services Association of Hong Kong, said for many older residents, concerns about Covid vaccine side effects outweighed the risks of getting the disease. \"In the past, a lot of people felt that it's not a priority to have the vaccine,\" she said. Now, care workers feel \"helpless\" as the virus spreads through homes, where some residents live four or six people to a room, she said.Karen Grepin, an associate professor at the School of Public Health at the University of Hong Kong, said the narrative in the city had evolved to the point that people had started to believe Hong Kong could keep the virus out forever.\"People really started to believe that even the miniscule risk associated with vaccination was higher than the risk of Covid,\" she said.\"We are paying for that complacency.\"Why Hong Kong is unable to shiftHong Kong isn't the only zero-Covid place in the world to experience an outbreak. Both New Zealand and Singapore spent more than a year shut off from the world. During that time, they prepared for an inevitable outbreak. They increased vaccination rates, especially in their most vulnerable populations, and adjusted their public messaging from eradicating Covid to living with the virus, albeit with precautions. And while both countries are now experiencing a spike in cases, neither are seeing the same level of deaths as Hong Kong.In both countries, more than 90% of those age 70 or over are fully vaccinated -- far higher than in Hong Kong, despite vaccines being available in the city for a year. Health care workers collect swab samples at a Covid-19 testing facility in Hong Kong on February 24.Pedestrians along a near empty street at night in Hong Kong, February 24, 2022.Experts say Hong Kong could have done more to emphasize the importance of vaccination -- especially among the elderly and vulnerable. Unlike many places in the West, Hong Kong didn't push vaccines as a way out of the pandemic because living with the virus has so far been rejected as an option. The Hong Kong government is ultimately answerable to China's ruling Communist Party, which maintains a stringent \"zero-Covid\" policy and has touted its suppression of the virus as evidence of the supposed superiority of its one-party system over Western democracies, especially the United States. Last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping instructed Hong Kong to \"take all necessary measures\" to contain the outbreak.A theory based on this idea that you can keep Covid out of your population forever just defies any sort of logicDr. Ramanan Laxminarayan, Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy\"With central government's support and the Hong Kong People's unity, we will certainly triumph over this pandemic,\" Lam said last Tuesday. \"After the storm we will see a rainbow again.\"Lam has maintained the latest measures are not dictated by Beijing, and instead are the result of the two sides \"exchanging ideas.\"Dr. Ramanan Laxminarayan, the founder and director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy, says Beijing believes its Covid policy is superior to other countries.\"It's the narrative that China will always be free of Covid that will be problematic for China going forward,\" he said. \"A theory based on this idea that you can keep Covid out of your population forever just defies any sort of logic.\"China's strategy is also driven by public health concerns. Mainland China, unlike Hong Kong, has yet to authorize an mRNA vaccine, despite questions over the efficacy over its domestically produced shots. And a study by mathematicians at the country's prestigious Peking University found that China could face more than 630,000 Covid-19 infections a day if it dropped its zero-tolerance policies by reopening its borders. Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist at China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said this week that the zero-Covid policy won't remain unchanged forever -- but added there was \"no need to open the door at the peak of the global epidemic.\"Workers build isolation units in Hong Kong on February 27, 2022.An aerial view of the Tsing Yi mobile cabin hospital under construction on February 27, 2022, in Hong KongAn uncertain futureAs other places around the world open up and learn to live with Covid, Hong Kong still has some of the strictest border rules in the world, including a ban on most non-Hong Kong residents entering. And for many in the city, the apparent absence of a more forward-facing plan is difficult to bear. Within days of the announcement of mass testing, a new Facebook group for advice on relocating had attracted more than 3,900 members, with some saying they wanted to get out before citywide testing started. One 37-year-old mother of two who asked not to be named for privacy reasons said last week she was leaving the city for Australia -- and was unsure if or when she'll be back. She worried that Hong Kong's public health measures could mean her son, who has an autoimmune disease, might not be able to get the hospital treatment he needs and that her children could be separated from her if they test positive.\"I feel like the kids are being punished the most throughout this whole thing. It's not fair on them,\" she said, referring to the restrictions. \"(The public health policy) scares me more than the virus itself.\"JUST WATCHEDBaby with Covid separated from family and quarantined alone in Hong KongReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBaby with Covid separated from family and quarantined alone in Hong Kong 03:41Many locals, too, are growing frustrated. James Hov, 31, poured his life savings into a barbershop that has been closed for weeks under the restrictions. He worries he could lose his business and struggle to pay off the engagement ring he bought for his future spouse.\"You can't end Covid. Closing barbershops but having a cluster of people on trains for their daily commute -- it's moronic -- I'm not so sure any logic was behind it,\" he said.One 25-year-old tattoo artist who asked not to use her real name as she is afraid of repercussions, said last month she is continuing her business underground despite a current ban. She is refusing to get a vaccine as she doesn't trust either the Chinese or Pfizer vaccines available in the city. She is skeptical of Hong Kong's policies, which she said were merely there to satisfy China. \"It's harming society, it's harming economics, it's harming people's well-being,\" she said. For Hong Kong, there's an unprecedented health crisis ahead, and then little light at the end of the tunnel -- even if the city opens up, another wave is inevitable, said virologist Sridhar. \"We're just waiting for either the next wave or a shift in stance from the powers that be.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)As we reach the second anniversary of the World Health Organization acknowledging Covid-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020, we appear to be standing on the edge of the endemic phase of this global health crisis. For many, that's the moment when we hope we can get back to our regular lives.   Several times during this pandemic, I have written essays about America as if the country was my patient. The current situation has me thinking along those lines again.  Doctors, like anyone else, love to give good news. We see the value of hope but also recognize that honesty must be our North Star. I would love to be the good guy here and tell my patient that it's time to be discharged from this chapter of our lives. But a doctor's job is to fully assess the situation and lean into the nuance, as opposed to simple axioms. Time for a physicalSo let's examine America, the patient. On the one hand, the numbers are going down. Cases of Covid-19 are more than a third lower this week than they were last week and the lowest they've been since July, according to the latest data from Johns Hopkins University.  And the number of people hospitalized is about a fifth of what it was during the country's mid-January peak. Even deaths, the so-called lagging indicator, have been falling; they're at their lowest point in two months. Read MoreAll 50 states are in the process of lifting restrictions. On March 26, Hawaii will become the last state to end its indoor mask mandate. Requiring masks in K-12 schools cut Covid-19 infections, study showsAt the federal level, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention made big changes in late February. Instead of primarily using  levels of coronavirus transmission within a community as the key metric for determining mask guidance, the agency recommends that three data points be considered instead: new Covid-19 hospitalizations, hospital capacity and Covid-19 cases. So now, instead of a transmission map that paints most of the country an \"inflamed\" red, the community levels map shows a lot of cooler green and yellow, with a bit of orange -- the new low, medium and high categories. Since that change, there has been a big drop in the percentage of Americans living under masking recommendations, from 99% under the old metrics to just about 2% now.And at the start of the month, the White House unveiled its National Covid-19 Preparedness Plan. The new plan focuses on \"vaccines, treatments, tests, masks,\" White House Covid-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients said. \"These tools are how we continue to protect people and enable us to move forward safely and get back to our more normal routines.\"As part of that, government testing and treatment initiatives are being streamlined and made more widely available. A closer lookBut in medicine, we cannot rely on lab results and a medical history. We need to perform a thorough and detailed exam. And when we do that, a more complete picture of the patient emerges.  First on CNN: Biden administration set to extend travel mask mandate for another monthTruth is, America, my patient still has an active infection. Although the numbers are falling, they are still painfully high: The country is averaging just under 37,000 new cases of Covid-19 a day. It's as if saying the patient used to have a very high fever but now only has a moderately high fever. The point is, it's still too high. We wouldn't stop treating the patient's infection at this point but rather complete the course of treatment and care.There's also the issue of understanding the effects the illness may have on my patient in the future. In this case, it means acknowledging an entirely new disease: long Covid. Many Americans are enduring the lingering effects of a past infection, battling health conditions like fatigue, brain fog, shortness of breath, cardiac issues. The list of long Covid symptoms is lengthy and varied; there are no answers as to who and why, nor are there easy, one-size-fits-all treatments. We are in the early days of this disease, but I was particularly struck by the recent paper indicating a previous Covid infection being a significant risk factor for future heart problems.And, even more important, there are still about 30,000 Americans hospitalized for Covid and, on average, more than 1,250 deaths a day. That's the equivalent of about two jumbo jets dropping out of the sky every day. My patient still needs lots of care.Other factors at playDespite the less red and inflamed transmission map, it still shows there's a lot of virus out there. If the virus came in the form of a raindrop, parts of our country would still be getting drenched. I have often imagined how different things would be if we could have actually seen the virus -- little green particles circulating around people's noses and mouths and becoming airborne. What if we had been able to witness its destruction and journey into blood vessels and lungs? This invisible enemy circumvented our basic human ability to detect a threat and, as a result, made us more likely to ignore and even deny it. Covid-19 safety tips to consider as you return to workI would remind my patient we have been here before. We experienced moments of genuine hope earlier and then witnessed how quickly things can change. In the summer of 2021, the Delta variant surprised us, and in December, Omicron blindsided us. Both times, the spikes caused by these variants followed declarations of victory heralding the end of the pandemic. Currently, there is a subvariant of Omicron called BA.2 that may spread even faster than Omicron itself. According to the latest figures from the CDC, it now makes up about 11.6% of Covid cases in the US; the week before, 6.6%. BA.2 is the dominant variant in Denmark, the United Kingdom, India, South Africa and more than a dozen other countries. According to the World Health Organization, studies estimate it is 30% more contagious than the original Omicron (BA.1).  And while studies suggest that BA.2 is not more likely to lead to hospitalization than BA.1, another patient that I've been keeping an eye on, the United Kingdom, is seeing cases and hospitalizations starting to trend up again after declining steadily since mid-January. Sometimes, doctors gain a lot of information from watching how other patients are faring.\n\n\n\nPodcast: Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta\n\n\nAgain, I get it. I would love to look at these past two years in the rearview mirror as well, but we need to learn the lessons of this pandemic and apply that knowledge in real time. Today. Now.Delta and Omicron represent two cautionary tales in the span of a few months. It would be shortsighted to ignore that reality, believing it will never happen again.  A blend of science and judgment The International Epidemiology Association's Dictionary of Epidemiology defines a pandemic as \"an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people.\"  Two years ago, when we made the decision to use the word pandemic on CNN, before the CDC or WHO, it was fairly straightforward -- fundamentally, it was an exercise in math and data analysis. My producers and I spent a lot of time looking at whiteboards where we kept tabs on the growing numbers and locations of Covid-19 cases. One day, I remember thinking, \"If this isn't the very definition of a pandemic, I don't know what is. So why is no one else calling it that?\"  And so we did.JUST WATCHEDDr. Gupta: Here's why CNN is calling this a pandemic (2020)ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHDr. Gupta: Here's why CNN is calling this a pandemic (2020) 04:40 Although the line was clear entering the pandemic, it will be much fuzzier as we approach endemicity.  A disease is considered endemic when it is a \"constant presence ... within a given geographic area or population group.\" It would also be predictable in its rate of spread without causing the level of disruption it does in a pandemic. But what is considered disruptive may be very different in one country compared with another, even from one person to the next. Progressing into this next phase will be based on a blend of science and judgment. What the exam reveals So if America were my patient, the question I would be asking: Is it really time to downgrade the country's present-day condition from pandemic to endemic? It's analogous in some ways to deciding when to discharge my surgical patients to the general care floor from the intensive care unit. This season's flu vaccine seems to be a poor match, early CDC data shows, but it's been a mild flu seasonI make rounds in the intensive care unit, carefully reviewing each patient's chart -- full of lab results, metrics and data. And then I sit at the bedside, watching, examining and understanding how they really feel. Can they stand on their own, put a fork to their mouth and a comb through their hair? Are their basic bodily functions returning to normal, and can they get by independently? It is a judgment call. Two people can have the same vital signs but be in very different places.     If America were my patient, what would I see when I sit at its bedside? Beyond 1,300 people dying a day, I would make note that almost 60,000 people died of Covid-19 during the month of February alone. In other words, more people died of Covid-19 in one month than die of the flu during a bad year.   So the question ultimately is: What is too disruptive? What are we willing to tolerate? At what point do we as a society throw up our hands and say, \"We can't do any better than this,\" so let's call this level of sickness and death \"endemic,\" accept the numbers and move on with our lives? And of course, my patient, America, lives on a planet with lots of other patients, all part of an intricate ecosystem. We must realize that America's health is dependent on the health of all the other patients on the planet: When any one of us is at risk, we are all at risk. Finding a measure of peace and quiescence None of this is easy. It's why epidemiologist and author Dr. Larry Brilliant said that \"endemic\" is a terrible word.  \"Smallpox was 'endemic' when it killed somewhere between a third and half a billion people in the 20th century. Malaria is endemic, and it's killing millions. Tuberculosis is endemic. And HIV/AIDS was sort of thrown out of people's consciousness by just labeling it 'endemic,' \" he said. Brilliant, who is CEO of Pandefense Advisory and\u202fa senior adviser at the Skoll Foundation, was a key player on the WHO team that eradicated smallpox.     Coronavirus wastewater data, CDC guidelines can give mixed signals on whether to maskHe pointed out that the technical definition of \"endemic\" is a disease that is generating an expected number of cases, to the expected community and the expected time. \"And because [Covid-19] is a baby of a disease ... it's way too early to try to figure out what is endemicity. We have to wait for it to become a teenager and see how it behaves,\" he said.  Brilliant prefers the term \"quiescent.\" \"We want this thing to be quiet,\" he said. He recalled that in the early days of 2020, he and other epidemiologists and public health experts speculated that the illness would come in waves.  \"A wave is a really good metaphor to think about this. Sometimes, the waves come in a bunch at a time, and sometimes there's not a wave for hours, even days. Some waves are too small to really be called waves. But every once in a while, there's a rogue wave, this tsunami.\"  Here's how to get free antiviral medicine if you test positive for Covid-19He explained, \"what we want is the interval [between waves] to be long and the water in the waves to be quiescent. And that's what we're trying to say when people use the word 'endemic.' ... To say that the pandemic has gone endemic is failure -- it's not success. We haven't put it where we want it. So it's the wrong way of thinking about it.\" Plus, said Brilliant, saying that the pandemic is over means \"we give up our duty of care.\"He believes we still have a duty of care to the immunocompromised, the elderly, the vulnerable and, yes, even the unvaccinated, because they are the ones disproportionately dying.  Life with an endemic disease Humans are increasingly living side by side with pathogens that were once in the wild but then took hold among us. We might not like it, and sometimes the pathogen comes too close for comfort, but we learn to live with it.  Take the parasite malaria. For millennia, it killed off wide swaths of the global population. In fact, the mosquito, which transmits the parasite that causes disease, is one of the most prolific killers of humans worldwide. Global Covid-19 deaths surpass 6 millionInarguably, the course of humanity has been shaped by malaria: It's believed to have contributed to the fall of Rome, and for hundreds of years, it helped protect Africa from European colonization even as it infected the local population. (And it's why the gene for sickle cell anemia, which is protective against malaria, never died off evolutionarily.) In this country, Presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln grappled with it. The disease stunted the physical and economic growth of the rural South through the 1930s, and it is why the precursor to the CDC was founded.   It's an understatement to say man has been living with malaria for a very long time. And although we may not have eradicated it from the face of the Earth or completely tamed it, we have learned to coexist with it and reduced it to an endemic disease in a shrinking number of countries. The United States eradicated it in 1951.   How did we do that? By arming ourselves with knowledge. Through scientific research, we learned about where malaria comes from and how it is spread. We developed mitigation strategies and medications to blunt its impact.  And our work is still not done: In 2020, malaria killed an estimated 627,000 people, the vast majority of them children in sub-Saharan Africa.Early detection, rapid responseMany experts, including Brilliant, are pretty sure that Covid-19 is here to stay. Like the common cold (also often caused by a coronavirus) or the flu, it's expected to be part of our lives for the next 10, 50 or 100 years, and life will never be quite the same again. Burnout may be changing your brain. Here's what to do But we can improve the situation and learn to live with it. \"We want the disease to occur in places that we expect it, in the numbers that we expect, so we know how to deal with it,\" Brilliant said. \"You can go to Hawaii on vacation and not worry. Your kids can go to school. And you don't need to worry about going to dinner with your parents or your grandparents. Maybe it's quiet and you have to still wear masks. Maybe it's quiet and you still have to be tested before you go someplace. But it's not on the front page every day.\" The key, said Brilliant, is two-part: early detection and rapid response.  For that to happen, we have to have good monitoring tools and be nimble going into and out of protective mode. Maybe that means we carry a mask in our coat pocket during wintertime, just like we take an umbrella when the forecast predicts rain; maybe we keep a box of rapid tests and a packet of antivirals in the bathroom cabinet for when we are under the weather; maybe we close a school but like we do with the flu -- with surgical precision, using a scalpel instead of a chainsaw.The good news, Brilliant said, is that moving forward, our tools -- vaccines, surveillance, tests, treatments, prophylactics -- will only get better. The inescapable fact is that we live in the era of pandemics. There are simply more and more opportunities for a pathogen, like the SARS-CoV-2 virus, to come in contact with the human population, make the jump and take hold. It's a dance we are increasingly doing because we are infringing more and more on the microbes' territory. Population growth, deforestation, climate change all contribute to this. Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team. These pathogens are going to keep emerging in humans, but pandemics are not inevitable. Humans have evolved to create remarkable public health tools to prevent that, just as long we are smart and humane enough to use them.  My patient -- America -- is still in precarious health and will have to be careful moving forward to maintain all of the gains and continue making progress. Both the patient and doctors will have to remain vigilant and act quickly if there's any new infection. It's just not time for my patient to completely drop their guard, however much we would all like that to happen. We can and should be hopeful, but honesty must lead the way, full and transparent.

And if she took this ride, she'd be headed into the unknown, unsure where she'd even sleep.\"And she got on the bus,\" Skopec, executive vice president of global health for Project HOPE, told CNN. \"That's everyone's story.\" More than 3 million people have fled Ukraine since the invasion began more than three weeks ago, according to the International Organization for Migration, or IOM, and legions more flee to the border every day. Meantime, many more of Ukraine's 45 million residents remain in a country where active conflict has cut off access to basic supplies like medicine.Read MoreTo serve their needs, the United Nations and its partners on March 1 launched an emergency appeal for $1.7 billion. Of that, $1.1 billion would go toward helping 6 million people inside Ukraine over the next three months and nearly $551 million help support Ukrainians who fled to other countries in the region.Aid groups are working now to address the massive humanitarian crisis -- inside Ukraine, along the country's borders and in places of refuge far beyond. At each stage, Ukrainians face distinct needs, aid officials have found, and delivering proper resources at each one is no easy task.Inside Ukraine, everything is neededThe need for medical supplies inside Ukraine is so great that Skopec stopped compiling lists. Every hospital is saying the same thing, he told CNN: \"We're running out of everything.\"He and a Project HOPE team traveled last weekend into Ukraine to deliver a shipment of medical supplies to a 4,000 bed, three-hospital network in Lviv. Among the supplies were specialized sutures used in a heart transplant the very next day, he said.\"Of course, we can talk a lot about the life we saved there, but this is a country of 45 million,\" he said. \"So, we won't and can't stop with the idea of just helping one person.\"Resupplying health care facilities -- and the doctors, nurses and support staff now doing their jobs in a war zone -- is the principal focus of Project HOPE's efforts inside Ukraine, said Skopec. The 64-year-old organization's mission is supporting health care workers around the world.A medical worker walks through the hall of a maternity hospital damaged in a shelling attack on March 9 in Mariupol, Ukraine.But as the demand for health care services inside Ukraine is greater than ever, the nation's supply chain has been severely disrupted, Skopec told CNN. He compared the needs to those of American doctors and nurses at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic: In Ukraine, health care workers in clinical settings are running out of masks and trauma supplies.Another aid group, Americares, has sent 3 tons of critical medicine and medical supplies to Ukraine, its vice president of emergency programs, Kate Dischino, said in an email. And it's working on getting more.\"We are getting requests from health care facilities in Ukraine running low, or stocked out of, the most essential supplies,\" she said.There's a heavy emphasis on trauma supplies like bandages and antibiotics due to the fighting, with at least 1,333 people injured as of Friday, per the UN Human Rights Office.But there are also people with chronic conditions who need continued access to care and medicine -- and primary care inside Ukraine is functionally nonexistent, Skopec said. For instance, an estimated 2.3 million people in Ukraine, or 7.1% of the population, live with diabetes, according to the International Diabetes Federation. And some 10,000 people in Ukraine depend on dialysis to live, several global nephrology groups said in a joint statement.A field hospital set up by medical staff with US evangelical Christian disaster relief nonprofit Samaritan's Purse operates Monday in an underground parking lot of the King Cross Leopolis shopping mall in the settlement of Sokilnyky near the western Ukrainian city of Lviv.\"Beyond the direct causes of conflict ... you have all of the emergency needs that every population on the earth has,\" Alex Wade, a Doctors Without Borders emergency coordinator told CNN on Monday. \"You have people who need access to insulin, people who need access to dialysis. You have pregnant women who need access to safe deliveries and, who could have complicated pregnancies, need access to surgical services. You have people with serious mental health conditions that need access to mental health services.\"These are all conditions where, if access is interrupted, the condition can deteriorate ... leading to serious complications or death,\" Wade said.And needs extend beyond medicine: Food is the most urgent one now for the Odesa Humanitarian Volunteer Center, said Inga Kordynovska, head of the group that launched after the invasion. On top of supporting locals in the port city, refugees are pouring in from other Ukrainian cities like Kherson and Mariupol, she said.Still, the nature of the conflict means there are large swathes of Ukraine where it's extremely difficult -- or impossible -- to deliver humanitarian aid.Firefighters work Monday at a building destroyed by a Russian shell in Kharkov, Ukraine.At borders, safe passage is planned for the wearyUkrainians escaping active conflict flee to the nation's borders, where their needs are distinct from those inside the war zone -- but just as pressing. Many tell similar stories: They left their homes on short notice, grabbing what they could and embarking on dayslong journeys. Some ran out of fuel or found it heavily rationed. At the border, they faced lengthy waits to cross.\"They're coming across exhausted, scared, angry,\" Skopec said. Strangers are leaving strollers, car seats, winter coats and toys at the Polish border for Ukrainian refugeesSome have medical problems that must be addressed immediately: exhaustion, dehydration or gastrointestinal problems. Project HOPE buys and distributes medical supplies to clinics and temporary shelters that receive refugees, Skopec said. It also provides hygiene kits to support public health -- and refugees' dignity.At border crossings to Poland and Romania, humanitarian workers support a refugee population still in transit, Skopec said. They move on quickly, getting tickets for buses or trains to take them further into Europe. More than 200,000 people entered Romania from Ukraine between February 24 and Wednesday, according to the IOM. The Romanian Ministry of Internal Affairs' state secretary on Tuesday put that number at 425,000, saying most had moved on to other countries.People wait Tuesday to board buses for further transportation after crossing from Ukraine into Poland at the Medyka border crossing.Aid workers at border crossings register refugees so assistance can be better targeted to their needs -- a challenge in itself. CARE International is among aid partners working within existing civil infrastructure to register refugees, particularly those with extra vulnerabilities, and share it with other vetted organizations, like resettlement agencies.\"In the chaos of mass displacement,\" it's difficult to register everyone, CARE's humanitarian communications coordinator, Lucy Beck, told CNN from Isaccea, Romania, along the Danube River at the Ukraine border. \"So the aim is really to put in place systems and registration to catch as many people as possible.\"CARE's focus on women and girls is also key: 9 in 10 fleeing violence in Ukraine are women and children, according to the UN's Children's Fund, or UNICEF. Ukrainian men between the ages of 18 and 60 are banned from leaving the country and must stay to help fight the Russian invasion.People line up Monday after arriving from Ukraine at the train station in Przemysl, near the Ukrainian-Polish border.Part of CARE's mandate is protecting women and girls from gender-based violence, like rape or trafficking -- a risk as they move from one country to the next, Beck said. For example, many people have offered transportation to refugees, and while that's generous, it could also open refugees up to trafficking.\"There may be predatory people who will be taking some of these women and girls away,\" UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffiths told CNN. \"That's an added, indecent part of this terrible conflict.\"Ukrainian women who escaped their country now go back to help fight the invasionIn Sighet, another Romanian border city, anyone offering refugees transport must register with aid workers so they -- like the refugees they're ferrying -- can be kept track of, Beck said. Meantime, vulnerable people, like unaccompanied children, are given specialized transportation services, she said.Volunteers and translators doing this work interact with a huge volume of people, Beck said. Needed, too, are counselors and social experts who can support those in distress or confused to keep them away from potentially dangerous situations.Border crossings are also filled with tearful goodbyes, and it's not just men. Beck met a 22-year-old woman who dropped off her 84-year-old grandparent at the border -- and then went back, she recalled.\"She was absolutely turning around straightaway to go back and volunteer,\" Beck said. \"Should it come that she (is) needed to fight, she was willing to do whatever it took, I guess, to stay and help the people in Ukraine rather than choosing to leave and go somewhere safe.\"Refugees from Ukraine arrive March 9 at the Siret border post in Romania.Far from home, entire lives must be resetRefugees are not just working to overcome short-term challenges -- they're faced with medium- and long-term needs, as well. And the shock of leaving their homes on such short notice could reverberate for years. Warsaw alone had welcomed 300,000 people in the two weeks that ended Tuesday, Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski said. The city, he said, will help refugees, \"but we are slowly becoming overwhelmed, and that's why we make a plea for help.\"\"If you think about all the things that you do as a normal person in your hometown, all of those things need to be ... recreated for people in another country,\" Beck said. Adults need to jobs and language skills to help to find employment; children need school.Crowds wait for a train to Berlin at Warsaw's central train station.Of the more than 3 million refugees who have fled Ukraine, Poland has by far received the most, at more than 1.8 million as of Wednesday, per the IOM. Hundreds of thousands more have entered Romania, Slovakia, Moldova, Lithuania and countries even further west, including Hungary, Austria, Germany, Belgium, Denmark, France, Portugal and the Netherlands, among many others, officials from those countries have said. Refugees have also arrived in Italy, where two Ukrainian schoolchildren from Lviv got a warm welcome from their Italian classmates after arriving to live with their grandmother.Refugees also need continued medical care, and the mass displacement has prompted a disruption in care for chronic diseases like HIV and tuberculosis, Doctors without Borders' emergency program manager, Kate White, told CNN. Medications for these conditions might be available for free or cheaply in Ukraine but are more expensive in other countries, she said.\"There is going to be a significant burden, either on the individual or on the government that welcome this population to ensure that they can have continuity of care,\" White said.International Committee of the Red Cross trucks wait in line Monday at the Siret border crossing in Romania on their way to deliver aid to Ukraine, in this still image taken from a video.Already, for instance, 16 Ukrainian patients whose treatment was interrupted by the invasion are getting care in Italy, the country's Civil Protection Department said Monday. Among them are nine pediatric patients in the Lazio, Emilia-Romagna and Lombardy regions.How to help the people of Ukraine And Krakow Children's Hospital, which has had a decadeslong partnership with Project HOPE, is moving to open a separate ward for Ukrainian children, with Project HOPE contributing supplies and pharmaceuticals and installing equipment, Skopec said.For those who want to help, aid organizations need monetary donations more than relief supplies. As well-meaning as the donation of medical supplies, hygiene kits and other items might be, money allows humanitarian groups to most efficiently direct their resources, Skopec said.With cash, organizations like CARE \"can look at that short-, medium- and long-term assistance,\" Beck said, \"and working with all the other NGOs and UN, identify the gaps in those different areas and sectors, so that we can work together to make sure everything's covered across different needs.\"CNN's Theresa Waldrop contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Two Harvard University students have created a website connecting thousands of Ukrainian refugees with hosts around the world offering them a safe haven.The idea was born when Avi Schiffmann attended a pro-Ukraine demonstration while visiting San Diego, where he came face to face with hundreds of Ukrainian Americans sharing distressing stories and pleading for help.\"I remember thinking, 'I know how to design websites with big platforms,' so how could I not do anything to help?\" Schiffmann, 19, told CNN. \"They need assistance, immediately and on a really big scale, and I had to find a way to make that happen as soon as possible.\"As of Friday, at least 847 civilians -- including 64 children -- have been killed in Ukraine since the Russian invasion began in late February, according to the latest update from the United Nations Human Rights Office.More than three million people have since fled Ukraine, according to the International Organization for Migration. Thousands more head to the border every day. Meanwhile, millions of Ukrainians remain in a country where active conflict has cut off access to basic supplies and medicine.Avi Schiffmann, left, and Marco Burstein, creators of the website.Read MoreSchiffmann, who resides in Seattle while he takes a semester off school, reached out to fellow classmate and friend Marco Burstein to share his idea.Although Burstein was in Massachusetts and entangled in the middle of a busy semester, the 18-year-old computer science major signed up for the effort.For three days -- and only a few meals in between, according to Schiffmann -- the pair spent every waking moment designing, editing and perfecting a website dedicated to assisting refugees.Ukraine Take Shelter launched on March 3. Within a week more than 4,000 people had created listings offering shelter to Ukrainian refugees.\"For me, I'm behind a computer across the world, which is what I'm good at, but it's very disconnected sometimes,\" Schiffmann said. \"To see so many people from countries in every corner of the world doing something to help these refugees, who need and deserve safety, is really inspiring.\"How aid organizations are responding to the crisis in Ukraine -- inside the country, at the border and beyondThis isn't the first time Schiffmann has used his passion for web design to help strangers.During the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, he built a website to track the impact of Covid-19. That same year, he also designed a website that tracked Black Lives Matter protests taking place across the United States.\"I see it like this: Almost everybody has a smart phone and internet connection,\" Schiffmann said. \"There's always something happening around the world, an earthquake, a war, a pandemic, and there is always a way to use technology to improve the lives of people in these humanitarian crises.\"To date, there have been more than one million users on Ukraine Take Shelter and over 25,000 listings. Short- and long-term hosts across the world have offered whatever they can, from living room couches and spare bedrooms, to entire homes and apartments.Schiffmann and Burstein are now working on a way to allow the website to also aggregate listings from major rental platforms, such as Airbnb and Vrbo, as well as listings posted by nonprofit and government organizations.The website has caught the attention of many, including the Ukrainian government, which responded to one of Schiffmann's tweets.\"Dear Avi Schiffmann, many thanks for your important work,\" Ukrain'e official government Twitter account wrote.'This puts power back into the hands of refugees'While designing Ukraine Take Shelter, Schiffmann's and Burstein's priority was making it as easy to use as possible.\"When I researched what tools Ukrainian refugees had to get connected to hosts, they weren't very efficient,\" Schiffmann said. \"This website allows refugees to not have to sit on a curb in some European country during the winter while they wait for one overwhelmed group or another to connect them.\" \"Now they can see tens of thousands of listings around the world ready for them to match with, and all they have to do is call or text them immediately,\" he said.The website design is simple. Refugees enter the nearest city where they hope to flee. Then they can go through available listings, each with a description of the accommodation.More than 2.5 million Ukrainians have fled their country since Russia's invasion. Here's where they are nowFinally, the refugee can click on the phone or email button to get the personal contact information of the listing holder.The site has been translated into dozens of languages, including Ukrainian, German and Polish.\"This puts power back into the hands of refugees by allowing them to take the initiative, go straight to the website, enter their city and immediately find listings,\" Schiffmann said. \"They don't need to rely on anyone else to help them find a safe place. There's millions of refugees, and it's going to be millions more, so balancing efficiency and security as well as safety is critical.\"Of course, there are safety concerns. UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffiths told CNN that human traffickers might take advantage of refugees. \"There may be predatory people who will be taking some of these women and girls away,\" he said. \"That's an added, indecent part of this terrible conflict.\"To mitigate the risk, Ukraine Take Shelter includes warnings on each listing to guide refugees on how to safely contact a host, request a video call, and recognize possible red flags. The site also provides examples of questions to ask.Schiffmann and Burstein said they worked with experts to make sure the site was built with strong cybersecurity.\"It can't get hacked into, and even if someone tries. There is nothing dangerous that can geolocate the refugees or put their lives at risk,\" Schiffmann said. \"There are safety features to make sure the refugees are in constant contact with the hosts until they arrive.\"The pair are currently partnering with major companies, which they can't reveal yet, to work on making sure all the listings are verified to better guarantee refugee safety. 'We want to help you find peace again'When a refugee searches the website for a host in the nearest city to them, they are met with dozens if not hundreds of options.Some are young couples who don't have much to offer but a mattress on the floor. Others are big families offering whatever space they can.\"We want to help you find peace again,\" one host from the US wrote in a listing.Many also offer to help refugees with basic necessities like food and clothes. Others offer babysitting help. Those who can't offer their homes can be found providing various forms of assistance, from donating money to pet sitting for those who need it.\"I have a place for one person...I know it's not so much, but I can provide a roof and food until he/she can find a job or a stable situation,\" another host offering to share their apartment in Paris said on the website.One of the host listings on Ukraine Take Shelter.Another host, in Poland, said: \"We would like to offer a double room in our home. We don't have a big house but you will be safe, warm and fed. We have a young child so feel we could best help someone with also a young child or baby.\"Among the thousands of interactions taking place through Ukraine Take Shelter was one story Schiffmann said would stick with him for the rest of his life.A family in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, were looking to escape the country. After matching with a host offering their French countryside home, the family fled. Only three days later, they discovered their entire home, including the basement where they had been sheltering, was completely destroyed.\"That's what made me realize how real this was, that this website isn't just helping people find housing, it's saving their lives,\" he said. After the war ends and the website is no longer needed, the pair hope to expand their efforts to help asylum seekers find a place to call home -- if even for a brief moment.\"I have plans to expand to all refugees in general, refugees from Syria, Afghanistan, any victims of natural disasters or wars,\" Schiffmann said. \"It is just as important they can find available housing, too, and we're going to make that happen.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Countries around the world will celebrate International Women's Day on Sunday, March 8. The day not only recognizes the achievements made by women, but also brings awareness to the obstacles that still stand in their way. If you want to get involved or need a brief history lesson on its significance, here's everything you need to know:When did it begin?Although the day wasn't officially recognized until 1977 by the United Nations, the history of the celebration can be traced back to the early 20th century, thanks to labor movements across North America and Europe. Members of the women's movement in Russia during World War I celebrated the first International Women's Day on March 8, 1913 to peacefully protest the war. A year later, women across Europe held rallies in solidarity on that same date. On March 8, 1917, thousands of women in Petrograd rallied together for \"Bread and Peace.\" This demonstration helped spark the Russian Revoluion. Read MoreFollowing World War II, countries from all continents began using March 8 as a marker for advocating women's equality. Hundreds of women march for abortion rights and workplace equality in downtown Boston on March 8, 1970.More than a century later, numerous events and marches still take place on that day to celebrate the achievements of women and to take action. Tangcheng Film and Television Base was free of charge for female visitors on International Women's Day and attracted about 100,000 visitors.What is it about?The United Nations is focusing this year on gender equality and human rights for all women and girls. The theme of the commemoration is:  \"I am Generation Equality: Realizing Women's Rights.\"8 March, #InternationalWomensDay is a time to \u2714\ufe0fchallenge gender norms,\u2714\ufe0fempower each other,\u2714\ufe0fcelebrate diversity,\u2714\ufe0fbreak stereotypes,\u2714\ufe0freject the binary,\u2714\ufe0fmobilize, and \u2714\ufe0ftake action.It's the time for #GenerationEquality!#IWD2020 pic.twitter.com/mo3F4HGbdq\u2014 UN Women (@UN_Women) February 27, 2020 \"2020 is a massive year for gender equality,\" said Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, executive director of UN Women. \"And the benefits of gender equality are not just for women and girls, but for everyone whose lives will be changed by a fairer world that leaves no one behind.\"She explains how even though there's been progress for women that \"no country has achieved gender equality.\"How can I get involved?There are many ways to take part in International Women's Day, from attending a festival to donating to a related cause.

        "content": "(CNN)Olena Zelenska, the first lady of Ukraine, posted an open letter addressed to the world's media on Tuesday, detailing what she described as the \"mass murder of Ukrainian civilians.\"In recent weeks Zelenska has repeatedly used social media to highlight the plight of her nation, yet none have been quite as direct as her recent post, which ends with the rallying cry: \"We will win. Because of our unity. Unity towards love for Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!\"As her husband, President Volodymyr Zelensky, has emerged as the face of Ukrainian defiance of the Russian invasion, Zelenska has become increasingly vociferous online as a means to support him and bolster international awareness of their country's plight. When Russia first invaded Ukraine on February 24, Zelensky declared in a video statement that he believed \"enemy sabotage groups\" had entered Kyiv and that he was their number one target. His family, he said, was the second target.Zelensky and Olena first met in high school.The whereabouts of his wife and two children are secret, for security reasons. Nonetheless, Zelenska has been playing an active role on social media, inspiring her people and backing resistance to Russian forces, while garnering support from the rest of the world. On Instagram alone, she has 2.4 million followers. Read MoreThe 44-year-old published the open letter Tuesday on her various social media platforms, as well as on the President's official website, in response to what she said was the \"overwhelming number of media outlets from around the world\" that had requested an interview with her. She began the impassioned missive -- headlined \"I testify\" -- by recalling the events of February 24.\"Tanks crossed the Ukrainian border, planes entered our airspace, missile launchers surrounded our cities,\" she wrote. \"Despite assurances from Kremlin-backed propaganda outlets, who call this a 'special operation' -- it is, in fact, the mass murder of Ukrainian civilians.\" Before the Russian invasion, Zelenska campaigned on numerous issues, including children's nutrition.Zelenska highlighted the \"terrifying and devastating\" child casualties, while also describing the horror of babies born in bomb shelters and roads \"flooded\" with refugees.  According to the website of the Ukrainian Women's Congress, a public platform that lobbies for gender equality in government and wider Ukrainian society, Zelenska was born in February 1978 and met her future husband at the Kryvyi Rih Gymnasium \u211695 high school in Kryvyi Rih, the southern Ukrainian city where they both grew up. Her biography on the site says she then majored in architecture at the Kryvyi Rih Economic Institute, graduating in 2000. The couple married in 2003 and had daughter Oleksandra a year later. Their son, Kyrylo, was born in 2013. Like her husband, who has a law degree, Zelenska moved away from her academic field of interest and into showbusiness. She helped Zelensky create stand-up performances for the Russian TV comedy show KVN, according to Ukrainian press agency UNIAN, and later became a screenwriter at TV production company Kvartal 95 Studio, which she co-founded.Zelensky is not Churchill. He's a more unlikely hero.In an extensive interview with Vogue Ukraine in 2019, shortly after her husband swept to power in a landslide election, Zelenska described herself as a \"non-public person\" who prefers to stay \"backstage.\" When her comedian husband first expressed his political ambitions, his wife was none too impressed. In the interview with Vogue, which featured a glamorous photo shoot, she said: \"I was not too happy when I realized that those were the plans. I realized how everything would change, and what difficulties we would have to face.\" She spoke of adjusting to life in the public sphere, but expressed her determination to protect her children, saying: \"Let them choose how they want to live.\"In the three years since assuming the role of first lady, she has accompanied her husband on numerous official visits around the world, including to the USA, Japan and France. Meanwhile her position has enabled her to focus on numerous issues close to her heart, among them \"children's health, equal opportunities for all Ukrainians and cultural diplomacy,\" she told Vogue. One of her campaigns has been to improve meals for children at school, going on fact-finding missions to Latvia, Japan and the USA, among other countries.Zelensky's heroism is coming up against Western red linesNeedless to say, she is now focused on Ukraine's battle for survival. Earlier this month she set up a dedicated Telegram channel to provide advice on \"how to act and live in war time.\"Hours after publishing her open letter, Zelenska, who in 2020 was admitted to hospital with Covid-19, updated her Instagram feed with a picture of young cancer patients heading to safety and treatment in Poland. She wrote: \"These are young cancer patients from Ukraine. Just yesterday, they were hiding from the shelling in the basements of clinics. Now they are crossing the Polish border on the way to find safety and, most importantly, to continue their treatments. No aggressor in the world can prevent them from winning the battle against the disease!\"In her open letter she reiterated her husband's demand for a no-fly zone, adding: \"Ukraine is stopping the force that may aggressively enter your cities tomorrow under the pretext of saving civilians.\"\"If we don't stop Putin, who threatens to start a nuclear war, there will be no safe place in the world for any of us.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Director Jane Campion has apologized to tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams, calling a comment she made during her acceptance speech at Sunday night's Critics Choice Awards \"thoughtless.\" The social media ire directed toward Campion over her speech for best director stemmed from one particular moment that came after she acknowledged the other nominees in the category, who were all men. \"The Power of the Dog\" helmer then said, \"Venus and Serena, you're such marvels. However, you don't play against the guys, like I have to.\"In addition to being inaccurate (the tennis champions have faced off men), some perceived Campion's statement as being dismissive of two successful Black women's accomplishments. \"I made a thoughtless comment equating what I do in the film world with all that Serena Williams and Venus Williams have achieved. I did not intend to devalue these two legendary Black women and world class athletes,\" Campion said on Monday in a statement via her representative. \"The fact is the Williams sisters have, actually, squared off against men on the court (and off), and they have both raised the bar and opened doors for what is possible for women in this world. The last thing I would ever want to do is minimize remarkable women.\" Read MoreCampion's speech -- which was for one of four awards her Oscar-nominated film earned on Sunday -- began on a positive note, with Campion acknowledging the many \"incredible\" women present in the audience, including the Williams sisters. \"What an honor to be in the room with you,\" she said, specifically addressing the pair, before asking them for tennis lessons.In her statement Monday, Campion reiterated her \"love\" for Venus and Serena Williams. \"Their accomplishments are titanic and inspiring. Serena and Venus, I apologize and completely celebrate you,\" she said. It has been an up and down few weeks for Campion, whose film is a strong contender for best picture at the Oscars later this month. Last week, actor Sam Elliott expressed harsh criticisms of \"The Power of the Dog\" in a podcast interview, blasting the Western's \"allusions of homosexuality.\" The Netflix drama, however, found many defenders in the aftermath against the comments -- naturally, its director among them.\"I'm sorry, he was being a little bit of a B-I-T-C-H. He's not a cowboy; he's an actor,\" Campion told Variety in response to Elliott's comments. \"The West is a mythic space and there's a lot of room on the range. I think it's a little bit sexist.\"CNN's Hazel Tang contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)It makes sense that Hollywood has rallied around Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. After all, he's one of their own.Before he entered politics, Zelensky was a comedian, actor and writer, starring in romantic comedies and as a high school teacher who becomes president in the Ukrainian political satire series, \"Servant of the People.\" His magnetism and skill at orating have been on display since Ukraine was invaded by Russia. His courage, passion and resolve drawing praise from around the world. During the recent Screen Actors Guild Awards, Zelensky received recognition from two actors as they accepted their trophies.Read More\"I would tell you we have a fellow actor in Zelensky who deserves some credit tonight for fighting the fight,\" Michael Keaton said while accepting the award for outstanding performance by a male actor in a television movie or limited series for \"Dopesick.\"Brian Cox, accepting the award for outstanding drama ensemble for his show \"Succession,\" also praised Zelensky.\"The President of Ukraine was a comic. He was a wonderful comic performer,\" Cox said. \"And we should respect that for him. To come to the presidency was amazing.\"Zelensky was elected president in 2019 in what the BBC described as \"a landslide victory.\" More about his career in the arts before he took office follows below.Volodymyr Zelenskiy walks backstage during the filming of his comedy show 'Liga Smeha' (League of Laughter) in 2019.He didn't just star in his productionsZelensky co-wrote the 2009 film \"No Love in the City\" in which he starred as a dentist with a penchant for the ladies, who, along with his friends, cuts a romantic swath through New York City.It's been likened to a male (but not as good) version of \"Sex in the City.\"The movie had its fan base and spurred sequels: \"No Love in the City 2\" in 2010 and \"Love in Vegas\" in 2012.His roles were sometimes politicalZelensky once played a character who becomes president of Ukraine after his video about corruption in the country goes viral, but that it was not his only role that touches on current events.The 2012 film \"Rzhevsky Versus Napoleon\" features the future politician in the role of political leader Napoleon Bonaparte during the invasion of Russia.Comedy rootsAs a teen, Zelensky began participating in comedy competitions and helped found what would become the Kvartal 95 comedy troupe.Journalist Amy Spiri tweeted a video of Zelensky from 2016 doing a comedy bit in which he and others appeared to play the piano with their pants down.\"Who among us has not played \"Hava Nagila\" on a piano with their genitals on stage and then gone on to lead their country against a foreign invasion?,\" she tweeted.  Volodymyr Zelensky performs with his \"95th block\" comedy group in Kiev in 2019.Voicing a beloved characterThe world recently discovered that Zelensky voiced Paddington Bear for the Ukrainian version of the hit 2014 film and its 2017 sequel.\"Paddington\" star Hugh Bonneville was thrilled by the news. \"Until today I had no idea who provided the voice of @paddingtonbear in Ukraine,\" Bonneville tweeted. \"Speaking for myself, thank you, President Zelensky. #PaddingtonBear.\" National pride over \"Dancing With the Stars\"The future president proved to be light on his feet in 2006 when he competed in and won his country's version of \"Dancing With the Stars.\"Clips of him and his professional dance partner Olena Shoptenko on the show have since gone viral.In another bit of irony, the American \"Dancing With the Stars\" former champion and dance pro Maksim Chmerkovskiy, who is from Ukraine, was in the country as part of a dance competition when Russia invaded.Chmerkovskiy documented his fleeing the country and return to the US where he now lives. The return of Zelensky's showUK's Channel 4 has reportedly picked up Zelensky's 2016 comedy series \"Servant of the People.\"It will air with the documentary special \"Zelensky: The Man Who Took on Putin,\" according to a report from Deadline.",

        "content": "(CNN)Placing its own slightly unorthodox twist on the Agatha Christie whodunit -- complete with an all-star cast, seemingly having a grand time doing it -- \"Knives Out\" is a whole lot of fun, intended to keep the audience off-balance right up until the finish. It's a razor-sharp throwback from writer-director Rian Johnson, which almost feels like a palate cleanser after directing the last \"Star Wars\" movie.The premise can be summed up neatly enough, with the apparent-suicide death of bestselling mystery novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), the 85-year-old patriarch of a highly dysfunctional family. The circumstances, however, leave everyone looking like a potential suspect -- there's the little matter of that estate, after all -- and thrust Harlan's nurse Marta (Ana de Armas) squarely into the midst of the craziness.Tasked with unraveling it all, meanwhile, is Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig), who speaks in a Foghorn Leghorn Southern drawl (a point overtly made) and is described as \"the last of the gentleman sleuths.\" Blanc spends a fair amount of time appraising the familial quirks, while saying Holmes-ian lines like \"The game is afoot\" and referring to a sidekick as \"Watson.\"As for the family, everyone has a possible motive for wanting to do in ol' Harlan, including his grown kids (Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon), in-laws (Don Johnson, a scene-stealing Toni Collette) and grandchildren (Chris Evans, \"13 Reasons Why's\" Katherine Langford, \"It's\" Jaeden Martell), who each rely on papa bear's wealth and anticipated inheritance in one way or another.Christie's mysteries have never really gone out of fashion, and indeed, have mounted a bit of a comeback with new versions of \"Murder on the Orient Express\" and the upcoming \"Death on the Nile.\"Read MorePart of the charm involves seeing these stars get to flex some different muscles. Still, Johnson offers a somewhat unique point of entry, providing a great deal of information early on, peeling back layers -- using frequent flashbacks -- as the story unfolds primarily within the confines of the Thrombeys' sprawling estate.\"Knives Out\" does include some current political references, but otherwise it's the kind of playful, cleverly constructed lark designed to be nothing more than fun, exhibiting a genuine fondness for both the books and movies that inspired it.That might not add up to a blockbuster, but like one of Harlan's mysteries, it's a movie that in its amusing simplicity could enjoy a long shelf-life.\"Knives Out\" premieres Nov. 27 in the US. It's rated PG-13.",

        "content": "(CNN)The best kind of science fiction sometimes feels set about 10 minutes in the future, and so it is with \"Severance,\" an extremely creepy, slow-moving but instantly engrossing Apple TV+ series. Produced by Ben Stiller, the project features a stellar cast, in a show about memory that proves appropriately hard to forget.The title refers to a procedure practiced by corporate giant Lumon Industries in which employees sever their memories of what transpires at work from what happens outside, and vice versa, theoretically bringing new meaning to the phrase \"work-life balance.\"Yet when a member of the team suddenly leaves, and a newcomer arrives, it upsets the chemistry within the office, triggering thoughts about what really might be motivating the practice -- and what the company might actually be doing that its robotic, happy-talking top brass appear eager to avoid.Answers don't come quickly, but the scenario becomes utterly fascinating, with Adam Scott as Mark Scout, the low-key new leader of the team; and Britt Lower as Helly, the new arrival who asks way too many questions.All told, it's enough to make even those pining for the office appreciate Zoom calls. As for the aforementioned cast, Lumon's personnel roster includes John Turturro, Christopher Walken, Zach Cherry, Tramell Tillman and Patricia Arquette, the last reuniting with Stiller after the splendid 2018 prison drama \"Escape at Dannemora.\"Read MoreFor Mark, the severed memories have served a particular purpose, allowing him to create distance between work and the pain he was experiencing after the loss of his wife.Scott turns out to be the perfect Everyman, but the cast is uniformly good. Why the others would agree to this Faustian bargain is only one of the breadcrumbs that \"Severance\" takes its time sprinkling, in a series that leaves plenty of runway for more at the end of its nine episodes.Created by Dan Erickson, there's a \"Twin Peaks\"-esque quality to some of the quirkier aspects of the series, such as Arquette's monotone-voiced boss informing Mark that \"A handshake is available upon request,\" the walks down impossibly long hallways or the odd obsession with melon balls at the awkward company celebrations. The show also invites comparisons to the under-appreciated AMC drama \"Rubicon\" and ahead-of-its-time 1960s series \"The Prisoner,\" given the confined setting and uncertainty about who can be trusted.\"Severance\" won't be for everyone, but those drawn into its antiseptic, maze-like workspace won't be able to get enough of its provocative implications about messing around with the brain and memories, a la the movie \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\"Light escapism it isn't. But until the show's fictional technology becomes reality, a series like \"Severance\" is just the sort of cerebral concept to help take one's mind off the daily grind of working 9 to 5.\"Severance\" premieres Feb. 18 on Apple TV+.

        "content": "(CNN)The slow wind-up has characterized all three of Marvel's Disney+ series, but the pacing feels particularly sluggish \u2014 and the endgame, pardon the expression, elusive \u2014 watching the first two episodes of \"Loki.\" Seeing Tom Hiddleston reprise his role as the suave Thor villain certainly has its charms, but thus far the god of mischief hasn't taken the shape of a wholly compelling concept.Part of the difference between this latest Marvel show and predecessors \"WandaVision\" and \"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,\" which offered similar promotions to supporting players, stems from the lack of a clearly mapped direction. In the former's case, it was Wanda working through her grief, while consciously satirizing the long history of sitcoms. In the latter, the story built toward the transfer of Captain America's shield into new and deserving hands.Loki being gender fluid confirmed in trailer\"Loki,\" by contrast, initially exists primarily as a showcase for Hiddleston, picking up the string from a loose end in \"Avengers: Endgame\" and teasing it out (and out).As the introduction reminds us, Loki escaped into parts unknown during the events of \"Endgame,\" as the Avengers tinkered with the past to alter the future. The result of that has left a Loki \"variant\" (a term with another distracting usage right now) on the loose, drawing the attention of an organization whose mandate is to police the time continuum.The problem with time-travel plots is that they tend to work best the less you dwell on the details. Thanks to the premise, the audience can think about little else, since the source of the drama (and considerable comedy) fixates on the threat that a glitch in time poses to reality itself.Read MoreThe program's primary kick thus boils down to Hiddleston, as well as his interactions with time cop Mobius (Owen Wilson), who realizes Loki isn't trustworthy but sees him as the means to an end. An early template would be \"It Takes a Thief,\" where a skilled cat burglar's insights were employed to help catch other thieves.With the time element and buddy aspect of that, the opening episodes could be called \"Tom and Owen's Excellent Adventure.\" There's less to do for the rest of the cast, which includes Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Mobius' boss.On the plus side, \"Loki\" looks fabulous, creating a bizarre world that feels distinctly different from other quadrants of the Marvel universe. Being weird, however \u2014 especially in those moments when it seems to be mostly for the sake of that \u2014 has its drawbacks too.For the most part, Marvel has proven exceptionally shrewd in capitalizing on the Disney+ platform to offer richer characterizations than the movies allow, while providing the streaming service with marquee titles that echo through the pop-culture space.Early on, the series asks a question at the heart of its appeal: \"What makes Loki tick?\" \"Loki\" clearly could have more tricks up its sleeve, since the format has dictated that these Marvel shows can only truly be judged at the end, not the beginning.Even so, the clock is ticking on whether the series can rally enough during the remaining chapters to fulfill its promise, as opposed to simply killing time.\"Loki\" premieres Wednesday, June 9, on Disney+.",

        "content": "(CNN)\"Inventing Anna\" transforms a juicy real-life drama about a con artist among the influencer crowd into a fairly inert limited series, in part by giving almost equal weight to the reporter who broke the story. Shonda Rhimes caught lightning in a bottle for Netflix with \"Bridgerton,\" but her latest creation is less likely to have tongues wagging.Rhimes has populated the show with a number of familiar faces from her ABC/\"Scandal\" days, but the marquee parts go to Julia Garner (\"Ozark\"), sporting an accent seemingly patterned after Balki in \"Perfect Strangers,\" and Anna Chlumsky (\"Veep\"). Even if Garner's character, Anna Delvey, actually sounded this way, listening to it for nine episodes borders on becoming a distraction at best, and an ear-bending ordeal at worst.While taking liberties with the story, the underlying bones of it are pretty sensational: Delvey, a \"fake heiress,\" beguiled the Manhattan elite and banks alike, worming her way into high society before the walls came crashing down and landed her in a courtroom.Julia Garner as Anna Delvery in 'Inventing Anna' (David Giesbrecht/Netflix).Delvey lived the good life, creating an image that fooled plenty of people and left many reluctant to discuss their relationships with her. That included running up expenses like a $62,000 trip to Morocco, with a friend (played by \"Scandal's\" Katie Lowes) holding the bill.Anna's story was a tough one to crack, due in part to the reticence of those she fooled. Enter Chlumsy's Vivian, who doggedly pursues Anna and her friends, trying to expose not just what happened but who Anna really is and where that peculiar accent might have originated. (The show is based on a New York magazine article by Jessica Pressler.)Read MoreStrictly as a viewing proposition it doesn't help that most of the episodes run more than an hour, which breeds a certain flabbiness in the storytelling. The same goes for a structure that shifts the focus to a different one of Anna's marks in each chapter, jumping back and forth in time before reaching the trial and eventually deciding her fate.Along the way Vivian and Anna have several prison interviews, but we're expected to accept that the reporter has bonded with her \u2014 or at least finds her oddly endearing, for reasons that frankly seem mystifying \u2014 even as she struggles to meet her deadline, hold her life together and, oh yeah, have a baby.If that sounds like a lot, it is, with a tone that's often whimsical. The flashbacks generally work better than Vivian's part of the story, which provides a reminder that portraying the practice of journalism in drama can be a thorny proposition, with a whole lot of misfires for every \"All the President's Men.\"Those criticisms don't completely undercut the meatiness of the story, and the schadenfreude of how all these privileged masters and mistresses of the universe were so easily deceived. But it does make \"Inventing Anna,\" finally, a bit of a slog \u2014 a series that seeks to be a little too inventive for its own good.\"Inventing Anna\" premieres Feb. 11 on Netflix.",

The agency did not specify where Sorokin is currently being held and said it could not discuss any future deportation plans.Attorney Manny Arora told NBC News on Monday that he hadn't been able to reach Sorokin and was \"working under the presumption that she is being deported.\" Arora could not be immediately reached for comment.'Inventing Anna' is Shonda Rhimes' drama of a grifter who fleeced the New York party eliteRead MoreHe told NBC that attorneys were given a month to appeal when a deportation order was signed on February 17.\"Legally, they should not be able to deport her until the 19th. ... But we are dealing with bureaucracy, and there are numerous filings in her case, so you just never know if there was a paperwork error,\" Arora said, according to NBC.Sorokin duped victims out of money by pretending to be a German heiress called Anna Delvey with a $60 million trust fund.She was found guilty of stealing more than $200,000 from banks and friends while scamming her way into New York society, the Manhattan District Attorney said after her 2019 conviction.Sorokin was released from jail in February 2021 after serving nearly four years on theft and larceny charges. But it wasn't long before she ended up back behind bars.ICE took custody of Sorokin on March 25, 2021.

Like most of the others, this beyond-grim drama falls short, at least initially, despite a strong cast headed by Diane Lane as the US' new leader.Unlike \"Walking Dead,\" which essentially skipped over the outset of the zombie outbreak, \"Y\" rather ghoulishly wades into it, counting down to that moment when the entire male population (everything with a Y chromosome) abruptly and inexplicably dies, leaving behind a world consisting of women, with notable exceptions.There's a touch of \"The Leftovers\" in the arbitrary nature of events, followed by the crumbling of the social order and frantic attempts to maintain it. Much of that falls to survivors lead by congresswoman Jennifer Brown (Lane), who stands tall amid the global chaos and isn't spared from partisan politics even during these extraordinary circumstances.Brown's resources include a nameless government agent (Ashley Romans) who is both deadly and ruthless, but even when the government begins to coalesce, she's hardly out of the woods in terms of cascading crises.In a sense, you almost have to get past the first few episodes for \"Y\" to settle into its dramatic arc, following multiple plots that include the lone cisgender male survivor, Yorick Brown (Ben Schnetzer), who must hide his identity. Yorick also has a pet monkey that's male, and both have \"future lab rat\" written all over them.Read MoreSuch science-fiction series generally begin somewhere after everything has gone to hell, so at first the show appears to deserve credit for trying something different by building up to the equivalent of the nuclear blast or lethal plague that suddenly changes everything. The wholesale deaths, however, and associated grief of those left behind cast a pall over the series, which with a few exceptions struggles to develop the kind of characters that made \"Walking Dead\" pop originally.Don't expect any immediate answers, either, about the \"why\" of the \"last man,\" as the concept -- based on Brian K. Vaughan and Pia Guerra's DC comic -- lurches forward in a way that feels relentlessly bleak and depressing. While no one would expect the dystopian concept to yield feel-good TV, watching society break down this way, at this moment, has a glutton-for-punishment quality without outlandish wrinkles like zombie gore to introduce a sense of escapism.In addition to the overwhelmingly female cast, all the directors and most of the key crew members are women, working under showrunner Eliza Clark, a playwright whose TV credits include TNT's \"Animal Kingdom.\"Ultimately, though, the series feels handcuffed by the device that sets the narrative in motion. Despite his potential importance to understanding what happened and humanity's future, when discovered by someone Yorick says, \"I'm just a guy. I'm not special.\"While not for lack of trying, nor is \"Y: The Last Man.\"\"Y: The Last Man\" premieres Sept. 13 on FX on Hulu.",

Yellow! Or something like 'Who would you want to be on a date with?' 'SpongeBob!'

For those that did make it, the mixed feelings about the toll on their young lives rings through loud and clear.\"I gave up my childhood for this industry, and it wasn't my choice,\" says Wil Wheaton, who adds, \"I don't know a seven year old who's like, 'What I want to do is go to work.'\"Wheaton also talks about his \"Stand by Me\" co-star River Phoenix -- who died of a drug overdose at age 23 -- saying, \"I was and remain so angry at the predatory people around him that didn't try to help him.\"Read MoreEven the comments by those who have grown up and stayed in Hollywood can sound vaguely chilling, such as Evan Rachel Wood -- a star of HBO's \"Westworld\" -- who says of her upbringing, \"I was bred to do this.\"The candid interviews also include Milla Jovovich, who addresses being sexualized at a young age; Todd Bridges, another cautionary tale, and the victim of abuse; Disney Channel star Cameron Boyce, who tragically died of a seizure last July; Mara Wilson (\"Mrs. Doubtfire\"); Jada Pinkett Smith, who appeared in \"A Different World\" before becoming the mother to child actors; and Henry Thomas, whose audition video for \"E.T. the Extraterrestrial\" is among the highlights.Cameron BoyceThose conversations are intercut with those a young aspirant and his mother, who insists she's not a \"stage mom\" as she drags the kid around to auditions and an acting coach.Winter also incorporates silent-film child star Diana Serra Cary and explains the Coogan Law, the California measure adopted to protect kids after Jackie Coogan (the kid in \"The Champ\") was fleeced out of his earnings by his family. (Those concerns, notably, have also migrated to exploitation of children on social media.)\"No one ever asked me how I was doing,\" Wood recalls, while Boyce weighed in on the difficulty adjusting as child actors grow up, and the craziness when \"your adolescent life is documented for all the world to see.\"Another point involves how easily it's forgotten that these little performers are children, with uncomfortable clips of kids getting singled out for criticism on, say, Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel's movie-review show.While each of the grown actors has an individual story to tell, clear themes emerge from their collective memories. They're the kind that make you want to grab the contemporary kids -- the ones whose families still harbor those dreams of Technicolor stardom -- and urge them to click their heels and go back home.\"Showbiz Kids\" premieres July 14 at 9 p.m. on HBO.

        "content": "(CNN)Marvel is changing the name and design of a character that debuted in a recent issue of the comic miniseries \"King Conan\" after it was criticized for its portrayal of an Indigenous woman.The third issue of \"King Conan,\" published on February 16, finds its protagonist stranded on a island with a scantily clad princess named Matoaka. The princess, as it turns out, has a dark past: She hails from \"a land far to the west,\" and once fell in love with a man who tried to colonize her people. When the man ransacked her home, she killed him, but her father nonetheless exiled her to the island, where she's now cursed to lure other would-be colonizers away from her native land.To people in Indian Country, Matoaka's name and backstory were a clear reference to the real-life Pocahontas, who privately went by the same name. For centuries, Pocahantas has been romanticized and mythologized as a woman who defied her father to save the English colonist John Smith from execution. In reality, she was around 11 or 12 when she first met Smith, and historians have disputed Smith's claims that she rescued him at all. Later, she was kidnapped by the English and raped in captivity, according to the Mattaponi tribe's oral history. Given that history, some Indigenous comic book artists and fans found the character in \"King Conan\" -- and the hypersexualized way she was depicted -- to be demeaning and disrespectful.Read More\"The real Matoaka was a pre-teen girl who suffered at the hands of her English captors,\" Arigon Starr, a comic book artist who is an enrolled member of the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma, wrote in an email to CNN. \"What's even more shocking is that most of this information is online; a quick search would have informed the writer, artist, editor and publisher that it was a poor choice to give this character the name of a famous victim of violence.\"Kayla Shaggy, a Two-Spirit comic book artist who is Din\u00e9 and Anishinabe, said she felt that the character reduced Indigenous women to an offensive stereotype.\"The fact that they depict an Indigenous woman as this nubile prize to be won by non-natives in stereotypical, fetish-y clothing contributes to the current, ongoing harm and ignorance of missing and murdered Indigenous women,\" she wrote to CNN.In light of the criticism, writer Jason Aaron apologized for the character, calling his decision to use the name Matoaka \"ill-considered.\"\"This new character is a supernatural, thousand-year-old princess of a cursed island within a world of pastiche and dark fantasy and was never intended to be based on anyone from history,\" he said in a statement shared by Marvel. \"I should have better understood the name's true meaning and resonance and recognized it wasn't appropriate to use it. I understand the outrage expressed by those who hold the true Matoaka's legacy dear, and for all of this and the distress it's caused, I apologize.\"Aaron added that he had donated the money he made from the issue to the National Indigenous Women's Resource Center. A spokesperson for Marvel said that Matoaka's name and appearance would be changed in future printings, upcoming issues and digital editions, though the details were still being finalized.Still, Shaggy was disappointed that the company didn't pull the issue from stands and halt distribution altogether.\"The character is still an Indigenous stereotype, her story is a rehash of racist narratives, and overall continuing the story still puts money in the company's pocket at the expense of native people,\" she said.Native Americans have long been marginalized and misrepresented in comic books, \"from the bloodthirsty barbarians and noble savages of dime novels, to formulaic secondary characters and sidekicks\" as Michael Sheyahshe explored in his book \"Native Americans in Comic Books: A Critical Study.\"\"To paraphrase from Michael's work -- Native people have been relegated to the sidekick, shaman, overly sexualized or super tracker characters,\" Starr said. \"We are rarely the main character or the hero.\"In recent years, however, projects helmed by Native artists and writers have provided more authentic representation in the comic book world. Starr and Shaggy said they hoped the \"King Conan\" controversy would result in more opportunities for Indigenous creators in the industry.\"The support for authentic Native characters and comics is out there,\" Starr added. \"Maybe one day, Marvel and DC will catch up to us.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Marvel is flying high right now -- coming off its breakthrough best picture Oscar nomination for \"Black Panther\" and a win for the animated \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.\" Combine that prestige with the promise of two more blockbusters, \"Captain Marvel,\" opening this weekend; and \"Avengers: Endgame,\" and it makes for a gaudy display of the Disney-owned studio's power. Still, danger could lurk ahead -- not in the form of a supervillain, but rather a hunger for content that will test Marvel's thus-far formidable limits.Marvel's arsenal is about to grow, via another Disney acquisition. Two signature properties, Fantastic Four and X-Men, will be reunited with their comic-book brethren, one of the benefits of parent Disney's pending absorption of Fox Entertainment holdings.Movie rights to those titles had been parceled off years ago, when Marvel Comics faced financial difficulties. While \"X-Men\" has produced a profitable series of movies, attempts to bring \"Fantastic Four\" to the screen have proved disappointing.Still, Disney's reliance on Marvel is about to grow, creating pressure to expand what's known as the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The company has generally been shrewd in that regard, but even Earth's mightiest heroes have exhibited vulnerabilities -- especially in television -- as the company reaches farther and wider to bring less-well-known titles to the screen.Read MoreMarvel is one of the centerpieces of Disney's strategy as the studio prepares to launch its own streaming service, joining other key assets -- especially \"Star Wars\" and Disney/Pixar animated hits -- in providing a come-on to consumers.In an interview with ComicBook.com, Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige stated that programs coming to the streaming venture, known as Disney+, will be \"entirely interwoven with both the current MCU, the past MCU, and the future of the MCU.\"It's an ambitious scheme, and Marvel has demonstrated its ability to create an interlocking franchise, while transforming titles that were hardly on the tips of most people's tongues -- like \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" and \"Ant-Man\" -- into rousing successes. If anything, the company's savvy exploitation of second-tier properties has been as much a linchpin of its unblemished box-office resume as its marquee heroes.Brie Larson as 'Captain Marvel'With pressure to feed Disney's need for premium, must-have content, the company is going to have to keep reaching further into its grab bag. That includes not only movies and Disney+, but servicing ABC, cable network Freeform, children's channels like DisneyXD and the other streaming service that Disney controls, Hulu.As enviable as Marvel's track record has been, unlike Iron Man, it's not invincible. Although the studio has remarkably avoided a major box-office misfire -- as even Lucasfilm experienced with \"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" -- ABC's \"The Inhumans\" flopped, and an attempt to spin off \"Agents of SHIELD\" died in development.Creatively speaking, Marvel's Netflix shows -- among them \"Iron Fist\" and \"The Punisher\" -- also fell well short of Marvel's top tier, even if it's difficult to quantify their commercial performance.Marvel is staying relatively mum about its output for Disney+, holding back announcements until after this spring and summer's movies. Several new shows, however, are being planned, including one built around the Avengers characters Vision and Scarlet Witch, and another featuring the Thor villain Loki.In addition, the company has announced a quirky animation lineup for Hulu, with four series in the works, among them \"Howard the Duck.\"Howard the Duck, of course, was a much-admired comic book that was turned into a 1986 movie, which laid such a conspicuous egg at the box office as to serve as a kind of shorthand for a misguided flop.A lot has changed for the better since then when it comes to comic-book adaptations, and Marvel has made clear that it feels emboldened to tell all kinds of stories, big and small, just as Lucasfilm is mining various quadrants of its galaxy far, far away.Yet as with any creative endeavor, the more at-bats taken, the greater the chance of striking out. Marvel remains the envy of the movie industry, but as the studio stretches to explore the outer expanse of its universe, the risk will only increase in terms of scrambling those well-laid plans.",

        "content": "(CNN)\"The Batman\" presents a muscular vision of the Dark Knight that hardcore fans have long desired, a dark and serious epic that's somewhat offset by two disclaimers: At nearly three hours, the movie hangs around too long, really feeling it down the stretch; and despite its origins, this detective-driven take owes more to movies like \"Seven\" and \"L.A. Confidential\" than other superhero fare.First, the very good news: Robert Pattinson is terrific as a young, brooding Batman/Bruce Wayne, narrating his story in a hard-bitten style that recalls the hushed tones of Dirty Harry and the film noir detectives played by Humphrey Bogart.Batman again operates in a corrupt, muddy-toned Gotham whose ornate trappings are part New York, part \"Blade Runner,\" and when pressed into action, his fights are bruising, not balletic. The look might be stylized, but director/co-writer Matt Reeves has steeped Wayne's tragic history in gritty realism, even more so than Christopher Nolan's trilogy starring Christian Bale.While running through the cast, there's also plenty to praise in Zo\u00eb Kravitz's Catwoman (a name never uttered, despite her fondness for felines), Jeffrey Wright's James Gordon and Paul Dano's Riddler. The last is dangerous, homicidal and enigmatic in a way that pushes the movie to the edge of its PG-13 rating, bearing a greater resemblance to Heath Ledger's Joker than Jim Carrey's manic incarnation, much less the colorful 1960s version.For those reasons and others, \"The Batman\" begins extremely well, introducing the masked vigilante -- still viewed warily by authorities two years into his on-the-job training -- as he teams with Gordon to investigate a grisly, high-profile murder. Lurking in shadows, the Riddler engages them in a game of cat and mouse, sprinkling clues and taunting Batman, who has sought to strike fear into criminals' hearts, rumbling when one asks who he is, \"I'm vengeance.\"Read MoreThe mystery carries through a dense mythology that incorporates not only the tainted foundation upon which Gotham rests, but Batman's origins (although for once, happily, they dispense with reenacting the murders that orphaned him). Those details emerge in part via Wayne's interplay with the loyal Alfred (Andy Serkis), while Catwoman/Selina harbors separate but equally grim motives.Robert Pattinson and Zo\u00eb Kravitz star in 'The Batman.'However resourceful Batman is, Riddler actually drives the story, in much the way \"Seven's\" killer led those detectives on a not-so-merry chase that left a trail of victims. As clues pile up, more and more of Gotham's power players get drawn into that web, with the Penguin (an unrecognizable Colin Farrell), the top henchman to mob boss Falcone (John Turturro), adding to the Rogues Gallery of villains.The script by Reeves and Peter Craig in some respects echoes \"Batman: Year One,\" portraying the character at a more nascent phase, if not a completely green one. The look reflects the art of Neal Adams and Marshall Rogers, whose work in the '70s helped redefine Batman and cast off the remnants of \"Biff! Wham! Pow!\" lightness and camp.While the seriousness is welcome, the level of darkness risks becoming oppressive in a manner that doesn't leave much room for fun of any kind. If that's hardly a negative for Batman-ologists, it threatens to blunt the film's appeal among those who can't identify the issue of Detective Comics in which he first appeared.Still, that's a modest quibble compared to the main gripe that \"The Batman\" could easily lose 30 minutes without sacrificing much. Most of that flab comes during the final hour, which serves a purpose in terms of the character's maturation but piles on at least one climax too many.That's a shame, really, because Reeves gets so much right that indulging in a \"Snyder cut\"-length flex from the get-go feels like an unforced error. Given what a major box-office attraction the film should be for hungry theaters and Warner Bros. (like CNN, a unit of WarnerMedia), plus the likelihood of sequels, there was no need to overstay its welcome.Batman has a long history of provoking passionate reactions and debate, and the latest entry will be no exception. In Pattinson, the producers have found a Dark Knight worthy of the hoopla, while creating a Gotham much in need of him.As new chapters go, it's a strong beginning; if only it had known when to end.\"The Batman\" premieres March 4 in US theaters. It's rated PG-13.",

        "content": "(CNN)Three decades after director Tim Burton's 1989 \"Batman\" film became a box office blockbuster and pop culture phenomenon, the decision to bring the Dark Knight to the big screen seems like it should have been a no-brainer. But in the years leading up to the film's release, it was as hard to breach the barriers to Hollywood as it was to break into the Batcave.One dedicated superfan refused to give up his crusade to bring the Caped Crusader to cinematic life, and in doing so he helped redefine Batman's perception in the public eye.\"By the time I graduated high school I had over 30,000 comic books that took up my dad's entire garage -- he never got his car in the garage,\" remembers \"Batman\" producer Michael E. Uslan of his comic book obsessed youth, growing up in the 1960s. \"I went to the first Comic-Con ever held in history, the summer of '64 in a fleabag hotel in New York City; I was an early member of comic book fandom as it organized. When I was 11 years old, I met Stan Lee for the first time and it was a life-changing experience.\"Producer Michael E. Uslan (Photo by Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for TCM)His passion burned into adulthood as he attended Indiana University, where he pitched the folklore department with a then-unheard-of take on comic book heroes as a pantheon of modern mythology: the Flash was analog to the Greek god Hermes and the Romans' Mercury, and so on.When a dean who'd read comics as a kid dismissed Uslan's pitch as preposterous, Uslan asked him to recount the story of Moses, then pointed out the undeniable parallels to Superman's well-known origin. \"He stops, stares at me for a veritable eternity and then says, 'Your course is accredited,'\" says Uslan. \"I then became the first college professor of comic books, ever.\"Read MoreWith some sly self-promotion, Uslan's popular class became the subject of much media coverage. Suddenly he'd receive supportive phone calls from Stan Lee (\"Which I always refer to as my burning bush,\" he quipped, as well as DC Comics' soon-to-be president Sol Harrison, who flew Uslan into New York and found ways to put his skills to use for the company between semesters -- a connection that cemented his connection to his favorite comic book superhero of all, Batman.Cover illustration for 'World's Finest Comics,' with Superman, Batman and Robin selling US War Bonds to sink the 'Japanazis' in World War II, 1940s.\"I began to write Batman comics, which was my dream since I was eight years old,\" Uslan recalls -- a wish-fulfillment that panicked him for \"ten minutes\" until he formulated his next dream, one that had been percolating since 1966 when the much-anticipated \"Batman\" TV series starring Adam West and Burt Ward debuted, shocking the young Uslan with its campy, tongue-in-cheek take on the hero he knew had dark, gothic roots.\"All I can describe the night to you is I was simultaneously thrilled and horrified by what I was seeing on TV,\" he remembers. \"As a hardcore fanboy who really knew the whole history of Batman, this was not the true Batman. This was not the creature of the night stalking disturbed criminals in the shadows. I realized they were making fun of Batman. It was being done as a comedy, and the world was laughing at Batman.\"\"That night, I made a vow, like Bruce Wayne once made a vow: 'Somehow, someday I will show the world the true Batman and attempt to eliminate from the collective consciousness of the world culture these new words, 'Pow! Zap! and Wham!'\"By the early '70s, legendary comics writer Dennis O'Neil and revolutionary artist Neal Adams had successfully initiated a return to the moodier, shadowy tone that distinguished co-creator Bob Kane and Bill Finger's earliest Batman stories, a move that fans and fellow creators embraced as a means of washing away the bad taste left among the faithful by the TV series, which had been hugely, but only briefly, all-pervasive in its popularity.Uslan, who by then had secured a job in the film industry, went to DC's Harrison with a new pitch: \"I want to buy the rights to Batman, and I want to make a dark and serious Batman movie and show the world the true Batman.\" Harrison urged him to reconsider. \"'The brand is as dead as a dodo,'\" Uslan remembers being told, \"He said to me, 'Michael, nobody's interested in Batman anymore.'\"But Uslan soldiered forward, teaming in 1979 with the esteemed former MGM exec Benjamin Melnicker to purchase and peddle the film and television rights.\"I was turned down by every studio and every mini-major,\" says Uslan. \"They told me basically it was the worst idea they ever heard, that I was crazy. You can't do serious comic book movies. You can't do dark superheroes. You can't make a movie out of an old television series. It's never been done.\"Writer-artist Frank Miller's 1985 landmark Batman miniseries \"The Dark Knight Returns\" provided a boost to Uslan's argument that the hero could thrive in the darkest, grittiest and most psychologically complex of storylines, to widespread, mainstream attention.\"What it did was it convinced both Hollywood and the general public that comic books were maturing and growing up and were no longer just for little kids,\" says Uslan. \"That change in perception was critically important to this movie getting up, and then an atmosphere of acceptance for it.\"Soon an up-and-coming filmmaker named Tim Burton, known for his imaginative, edgy visual sense and affection for freakish characters came aboard. Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Keaton with director Tim Burton on the set of his movie 'Batman Returns.' It was Burton who cracked the code. \"He had the vision,\" says Uslan. \"He knew how to do the world's first revolutionary, dark, serious comic book superhero movie. He said to me, 'This movie, if we're going to do it this way and not get unintentional laughs from the audience, is not about Batman. It's got to be about Bruce Wayne. We have to show a Bruce Wayne so obsessed and driven to the point of being psychotic that audiences will go, oh yeah, that's a guy who would get dressed up as a bat and go out and do that.' It was critical to the whole suspension of disbelief.\"\"Then he said 'Gotham City has to be the third most important character of this movie,\" Uslan adds \"From the opening frames of the movie, we have to convince audiences that Gotham City is real, because that's the only way they'll accept a guy like Batman and the Joker seriously.' He was absolutely right about it.\"Suddenly, seemingly disparate pieces began to form a compelling whole: Academy Award winning actor Jack Nicholson signed on to play the Joker, a role that seemed tailor-made for him; Burton's choice of his \"Beetlejuice\" collaborator Michael Keaton, known primarily for comedy, to play Batman launched endless fan debates over the film's serious intentions; Prince, the reigning pop music genius of the moment provided a funky soundtrack, while former Oingo Boingo frontman Danny Elfman delivered a broody, operatic score; another Oscar winner, production designer Anton Furst, fully realized a Gotham City that was one part industrial oppression, one part gothic monument.Michael Keaton on the set of 'Batman' Somehow, it all coalesced, and, as the character turned 50 years old, a blockbuster franchise was born -- one that would boost comic sales, launch a toy and merchandising dynasty, spawn further film and TV iterations as well as a fresh superheroic cinema genre and, perhaps most importantly, reimagine Batman as the dark avenger of the night he was always meant to be (fond memories of Adam West notwithstanding).\"My belief was always 'Let's just find great filmmakers who love this character, have an understanding and knowledge of it, have a vision for it,'\" says Uslan, whose name continues to grace the credits of every subsequent Batman television and film production. \"With Batman in particular, it's about story, story, story and character, character, character. It's not about blowing stuff up and showing off special effects. It's about his humanity...It's important to always respect the character, who's now celebrating his 80th Anniversary.",

        "content": "New York (CNN Business)\"The Batman\" opens this weekend and theaters are hoping this blockbuster film will help the industry nudge closer toward normalcy.The film stars Robert Pattinson as the Caped Crusader. It is projected to bring in roughly $100 million for its opening weekend in North America. That would be one of the best openings for the series, but strong buzz and the character's historical success at the ticket booth could propel the Warner Bros. film even higher. It brought in $21.6 million for its  preview showings. (Warner Bros., like CNN, is a unit of WarnerMedia.)\"'The Batman' is the most anticipated film since [December's] 'Spider-Man: No Way Home,' and we all know how that delivered the goods,\" Jeff Bock, senior analyst at entertainment research firm Exhibitor Relations, told CNN Business. \"'The Batman' is not only the film theaters want, it's the film theaters need right now.\" But will the lingering effects of the pandemic and a nearly three hour run time keep \"The Batman\" from saving theaters?Read MoreThe theater industry's dark knightRobert Pattinson and Zoe Kravitz star in \"The Batman.\"Many films over the last year, from \"A Quiet Place Part II\" to \"No Way Home,\" helped theaters stay afloat. But theaters haven't been able to re-establish their pre-pandemic footing consistently because of new  coronavirus variants popping up and causing cases to surge. \"The Batman\" could change that this weekend.The film is being released as Covid cases are dropping and momentum at the ticket booth is growing thanks to hits like \"No Way Home,\" \"Scream\" and \"Uncharted.\" If \"The Batman\" can bring in crowds this weekend and over the next few weeks, it could be a bridge to the historically lucrative summer movie season.\"The box office year of 2022 will get its spiritual start in March with 'The Batman,'\" Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore (SCOR), told CNN Business. \"It seems like the planets are perfectly aligned for the film.\"Theater owners can be optimistic given the character's track record at the box office. Films based on the Caped Crusader have brought in more than $5 billion at the global box office since the first film, 1989's \"Batman.\" Why 'The Batman' heading to theaters is important to Warner BrosThe moody superhero has starred in a prolific and eclectic number of movies from Academy-Award winning films (2008's \"The Dark Knight\"), crossovers with other DC heroes (2016's \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\"), animated films (1993's \"Batman: Mask of the Phantasm\"), animated films made out of LEGOs (2017's \"The LEGO Batman Movie\") and even one of the worst films of all time (1997's \"Batman & Robin\").\"Batman is one of the most beloved and revered characters in all of filmdom,\" Dergarabedian said. He added that Christopher Nolan's take on \"Batman\" over three films from 2005 to 2012 reinvigorated the franchise, turning the iconic crime fighter from a \"camp classic hero to serious cinematic character.\"That serious tone for the Batman universe continues this weekend with a film that's not just garnering the attention of audiences, but critics as well.A '176-minute latex procedural'Robert Pattinson in \"The Batman.\"\"The Batman\" holds an 86% score on review site Rotten Tomatoes, with critics praising the film's direction and Pattinson's brooding take on the character.David Ehrlich, IndieWire's chief film critic, called the film \"a sprawling, 176-minute latex procedural that often appears to have more in common with serial killer sagas like 'Se7en' and 'Zodiac' than it does anything in the Snyderverse or the [Marvel Cinematic Universe].\"That type of description could pique the interest of audiences looking for something fresh from their superhero fare. However, the film's violent tone could also alienate families looking to take their young children to the latest Batman flick.Another issue that could keep the film from reaching the box office heights of other superhero movies is that \"The Batman\" clocks in at two hour and 56 minutes.Which Batman actor has made the most at the ticket booth?That lengthy run time will likely cut down on how many screenings the film could get this weekend, and keep away audiences who don't want to spend that much time in Gotham City.Yet long run time and grim tone notwithstanding, it's likely that Batman will follow in Spider-Man's footsteps and bring in the type of blockbuster opening numbers that could set off a much-needed revitalizing year for the theater industry.\"It's interesting that a spider and a bat would be the saviors of theaters,\" Dergarabedian said. \"But 'The Batman's' expected success will create an excitement and momentum that should carry forward and boost the other blockbusters that are on the calendar for the rest of the year.\"",

Superman: Dawn of Justice.Comic-Con: Ben Affleck's 'Batman' makes an appearanceThe Oscar-winning director-star has both a sense of perspective and humor about the most recent meme to hybridize his name.Briefly on hiatus from filming the mega-budget superhero action flick in Detroit to attend San Diego's Comic-Con International\u2014where Affleck stunned the crowd, appearing alongside co-star Henry Cavill and director Zack Snyder to debut footage from Batman v. Superman but giving no interviews\u2014Affleck appeared to have packed on pounds of muscle in the service of portraying a decidedly un-Bale-like kind of Batman/Bruce Wayne. That is, one in his mid-forties, his hair flecked with grey.'Batman v Superman': Meet your new AquamanHe remained tight-lipped about the particulars of the 3D follow-up to Snyder's Man of Steel that's set to reach theaters in March 2016, part of a DC cinematic universe that will also eventually include a Justice League movie. But for the first time, Affleck addressed certain issues\u2014in particular, the fan freak-out surrounding his casting\u2014 about which he's until now remained resolutely silent.EW: So what it's like to portray Batman?Ben Affleck: I'm right in the middle of shooting now. It's a process that I'll probably have better perspective on when I'm done. I can tell you that every time I do a role, it's the responsibility of an actor to get their physical self as close to the role as possible. And Batman's obviously got a set of expectations that are tough. So I spent a lot of time working out. And it's a far cry from Gone Girl where my character is described as \"puffy and hungover.\" I want you to know I worked equally hard at both! [laughs]Affleck says tabloid scrutiny helped 'Gone Girl'EW: It feels slightly ridiculous using the word \"outcry\" describing your casting. But there was actual outcry\u2014a lot of people freaked when they heard about Batfleck. To what extent did all that get under your skin?Affleck: Before I took the role, Warner Bros. gave me a bunch of past reactions to casting and said, \"Are you sure you want to get into this? This is part and parcel of these movies now. There's a lot of active fans with a lot of opinions.\" To me, having been through a certain amount of that, it doesn't really... Everyone's entitled to their opinion. I wouldn't have taken the part if I didn't trust my instincts in terms of the filmmaking. I think Chris Terrio wrote a terrific script.

        "content": "(CNN)The best Disney/Pixar animated movies historically straddle the line between delighting children and adults. \"Soul,\" a Pixar title diverted to Disney+, tilts heavily toward the latter, beautifully exploring ambitious themes about the meaning of life that should resonate more with adults than the younger souls in your streaming orbit.That warning aside, credit Pixar veteran Pete Docter (\"Up\" and \"Inside Out\") and co-director Kemp Powers (the writer of the play and upcoming movie \"One Night in Miami\") with an addition to Pixar's library worthy of its classics. While the movie might not have been a commercial slam dunk, it's hard not to admire a premise that dares to tackle such lofty ideas as life after death and what makes living worthwhile, as filtered through the hopes and dreams of Joe Gardner (voiced by Jamie Foxx).A middle-school music teacher, Joe has spent his life yearning to make it as a musician, pursuing gigs at the expense of his career. When the opportunity suddenly presents itself to live out those dreams, his distracted glee leads to his untimely demise -- a real bummer, considering that he had just said he \"could die a happy man\" if he got to play with the musician that had offered him the chance.Awakening on the escalator to the hereafter, Joe makes a desperate break to go back, leading to a fairly amusing tour of what the great beyond might resemble. While that animation is customarily lush, the actual character design of the \"souls\" is rounded and simple -- a bit like the Poppin' Fresh doughboy, only a slightly eerie shade of blue.In the process, Joe encounters a young soul in what's known as The Great Before, 22 (Tina Fey), who has long resisted embarking upon the journey to Earth, despite a hilarious roster of mentors that includes a who's who of historical figures.Read MoreIt's around here where \"Soul\" really begins to leave small fry behind, unless your preteen is apt to get jokes about George Orwell and Mother Teresa.Pixar's 'Soul.'Ultimately, Joe and 22 do find their way to Earth, but not in the way (or form) he expected, leading to a madcap series of encounters as he seeks to achieve what he sees as his life's purpose.That section of the movie unfolds cleverly enough, but it's the resolution that really brings the whole idea home. The emotional nature of that experience recalls the opening sequence in \"Up,\" which silently chronicled a lifetime of love and ultimately loss, leaving many adults in the theater (ah, theaters) sobbing while their kids waited to get to the talking dog and airborne house.\"Soul\" also features a wonderful score, since music is fundamental to the story, provided by Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross with jazz compositions courtesy of Jon Batiste -- again, not something likely to be fully appreciated by the tykes on the couch.Aside from Foxx and Fey, the voice cast includes Phylicia Rashad, Angela Bassett and Graham Norton and Daveed Diggs.Of course, the idea of animation tackling big, existential themes is welcome, and the \"Soul\" creative team deserves enormous credit for the effort. Yet one suspects translating that into the sort of box-office stampede Pixar has enjoyed with movies like the \"Toy Story\" and \"Incredibles\" franchises would have been challenging, making the direct-to-streaming gambit less of a financial sacrifice.Either way, \"Soul\" is highly recommended -- especially to adults who might not be otherwise inclined -- and a return to form for Pixar after the less-satisfying \"Onward.\" Parents wanting to really enjoy it, however, might want to watch at least once without their kids, who, understandably, will be less cognizant of choices made, roads not taken and where their own escalators might lead them.\"Soul\" premieres Dec. 25 on Disney+.

        "content": "(CNN)Pixar dips into the ocean once too often with \"Luca,\" a colorful but thin (and literal) fish-out-of-water tale. Although the movie touches on familiar themes about friendship, overcoming differences and letting children go, there's roughly enough story for something between an animated short and the film that lands, understandably in hindsight, via Disney+ instead of theaters.The title character owes a debt to another curious ocean-dweller that helped launch the modern resurgence of Disney animation, \"The Little Mermaid.\" Discontented with his life under the sea, Luca (voiced by \"Room's\" Jason Tremblay) yearns for an existence he can scarcely fathom above the waves, which seems magical to a young sea monster (or \"little merman,\" in a sense).Naturally, Luca's inquisitive nature exasperates his mother (Maya Rudolph), who warns him, \"The curious fish gets caught.\" Indeed, he's introduced nearly doing just that, coming too close to the fishing nets of a \"land monster\" from the quaint village nearby in the Italian Riviera.On shore, for some reason, sea monsters assume human form, which is where Luca meets Alberto (\"It'\" and \"Shazam!'s\" Jack Dylan Grazer), a slightly older sea monster with a wandering spirit who has this whole land thing down -- or at least, insists that he does. Their joint discoveries carry the story for a while, before they meet a human girl, Giulia (Emma Berman), who gives them the half-baked idea of entering a local race, and dazzles Luca with tales of her world.It's around then that the film, directed by Enrico Casarosa (whose credits include the Oscar-nominated Pixar short \"La Luna\"), begins to feel like it's treading water, as the boys experience a rift thanks to Luca's friendship with Giulia, and weather a series of near misses every time one of them gets wet, at the risk of exposing what amount to their secret identities.Read MoreTwo sea monsters get a taste of dry land in Pixar's 'Luca' (Disney+).Pixar movies have a habit for finding simple truths and tugging at the heartstrings, and \"Luca\" accomplishes some of that deftly enough before it's over.Mostly, though, it's a bit of a bore when ashore -- another tale of a kid who feels misunderstood and runs away from home (or the reef), forcing his parents (Jim Gaffigan plays dad) to contemplate whether they've been too rigid in demanding that he adhere to family traditions.At its best, the film offers lovely glimpses of Italy, while adding to the relatively modest subgenre of human/sea-creature relations. There's also a deeper undercurrent in the theme of hiding who you are.Otherwise, it's the sort of generic concept that's pleasant enough but falls short of the high standards Pixar has set, and after the disappointing \"Onward,\" recently achieved again with \"Soul,\" which exemplified the ambition that \"Luca\" (the movie, not the character) conspicuously lacks. That applies to the casting as well, which includes squandering Sacha Baron Cohen in a throwaway role.Studios have engaged in an imprecise science in deciding how best to exhibit films since the pandemic began, in some instances seemingly leaving money on the table by redirecting movies to streaming or offering them at home simultaneously with their release.In the case of \"Luca,\" it's easy to see why Disney opted to bypass theaters and go with the streaming flow. Because while it's not bad, the movie ultimately feels like a little fish in a big pond.\"Luca\" premieres June 18 on Disney+. It's rated PG.",

        "content": "(CNN)With Broadway marquees dark, this weekend brings a welcome double dose of the New York stage to TV screens: \"American Utopia,\" David Byrne's free-spirited concert, directed by Spike Lee for HBO; and \"What the Constitution Means to Me,\" Heidi Schreck's not-quite one-woman show, a searing political commentary that finds an at-home forum via Amazon.Both shows are worth the time, although seeing them at home, frankly, reinforces what's lost in translation given the tingle that live theater, at its best, can send up your spine -- a sensation that doesn't quite emerge on either front. Together, they underscore what \"Hamilton\" so impressively accomplished by conjuring that elusive magic. Notably, HBO Max's \"The West Wing\" special also captures some of that by bringing a TV show to the stage for the purposes of watching at home. (Like CNN, HBO is a unit of WarnerMedia.)Byrne, the Talking Heads front man, has always possessed a theatrical and cinematic flair, including his 1986 directorial effort \"True Stories.\" Those qualities inform \"American Utopia,\" a collection of songs -- imaginatively choreographed and lit -- that conveys the joyous and playful aspects of his music.On the plus side, that sense of fun is entertaining enough. The main drawback is that while Byrne addresses pressing issues during his chatting with the audience -- including the importance of voting, and introducing his performance of Janelle Monae's \"Hell You Talmbout,\" name-checking Black people killed by police -- there's scant thematic adhesive to the presentation, unlike some other productions wedding rock to Broadway (Bruce Springsteen's \"Springsteen on Broadway,\" filmed for Netflix, comes to mind).Lee does an admirable job of shooting the performance from every conceivable angle, although while the overhead shots are quite cool, one could probably do without closeups on Byrne's feet, which along with the rest of the performers, are bare.Read MoreByrne's playlist includes the hit \"Burning Down the House,\" and a boisterous rendition of \"Road to Nowhere,\" which includes a march through the appreciative audience.\"American Utopia\" doesn't set the screen ablaze, but Byrne and his collaborators certainly know how to put on a show, even when it feels like they're going nowhere.Heidi Schreck in 'What the Constitution Means to Me'\"What the Constitution Means to Me,\" by contrast, is an audacious idea, one that starts slowly -- at least in this format -- before sinking in its hooks about halfway through.Playwright-star Schreck (a Tony nominee on both scores) earned college tuition money by competing in Constitutional debates, and revives her 15-year-old self to explore -- humorously at first, pointedly later -- its troubling and inequitable aspects, including mistreatment of women.Schreck's reminiscing about \"Dirty Dancing\" and visiting legion halls to wax eloquently about the Constitution to mostly older men come into sharper focus when she exits the time capsule, and pivots to speaking in her 40-something voice.At that moment her memories and observations become sharper, from the patriarchal values of the court to violence against women to her own experience with abortion.\"When abortion became illegal, it didn't become rare,\" she says, referencing the days before Roe v. Wade. \"It only became deadly.\"Schreck closes by engaging in a debate with a teen orator, Rosdely Ciprian, about whether the Constitution is indeed the living, breathing document that we've been taught to admire in school -- adaptable to the modern age -- or a hopelessly dated construct that needs to be discarded, starting over from scratch. It's an interesting device, while lacking the impact of the material that precedes it.Directed by Marielle Heller (\"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\"), \"What the Constitution Means to Me\" serves as a reminder that those pining for the past tend to ignore historic inequalities. There's even quotation from the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg -- who caused a stir when she saw the show last year -- which makes the special feel extra timely and poignant.Minor drawbacks aside, both shows have plenty to recommend them. And if live theater means anything to you, they provide at least a taste of what you're missing.\"What the Constitution Means to Me\" premieres Oct. 16 on Amazon.\"American Utopia\" premieres Oct. 17 at 8 p.m. ET on HBO, which like CNN, is a unit of WarnerMedia.",

        "content": "(CNN)\"I found out two days ago that I'm pregnant,\" Amy Schumer says tearfully at the start of the \"Expecting Amy.\" \"Maybe I'll document it or something.\" That translates into a three-part docuseries, and a test of one's fandom level toward the comic/actor, offering a very-personal account of her gestation process for two things: The baby she had last year, and a Netflix stand-up special.Primarily shot by Schumer and her husband, Chris Fischer, using their phones, viewers should be forewarned that Schumer had an extremely difficult pregnancy, and this HBO Max presentation illustrates that by showing her throwing up in a variety of locales. In fact, it's hard not to think about Fischer snatching up his phone every time his wife becomes nauseous so he can capture the moment, which speaks to a certain level of commitment to the process.The degree of personal detail is a testament, in theory, to Schumer's unflinching openness, and highlights the balance associated with juggling a pregnancy and work -- in this case, a high-profile career touring clubs to hone her material.That proves to be the more unique aspect of this project, seeing Schumer workshop and fine-tune her act. In addition, there's the friction that ensues over her decision to talk about her husband -- diagnosed with being on what she calls the \"mild\" end of the autism spectrum -- as part of the show.Amy Schumer in 'Expecting Amy.'Directed and edited by Alexander Hammer (who worked on Beyonc\u00e9's \"Homecoming\"), \"Expecting Amy's\" journey includes video of the couple's wedding, tracking Schumer as she participates in protests against then Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and moments in which she brings her dog on stage, again demonstrating that pooches remain the ultimate scene-stealers, even in a verit\u00e9-style documentary. Plus, lots of ultrasounds, run-ins with paparazzi and, lest anyone forget, vomiting.Read MoreSchumer seems mindful of the possibility the exercise will appear a tad self-indulgent, at one point asking if she sounds whiny, and during another looking directly into the camera and saying, \"Stars, they're just like us.\"Yet that is, inevitably, part of the appeal, as even a perfunctory glance at People and US Weekly would attest. For anyone who doesn't crave such access, Schumer's discussions with the likes of Colin Quinn and Jerry Seinfeld offer a more intriguing window into her professional world.\"I can always perform,\" Schumer says, despite feeling shaky physically. \"You just have to do your job.\"Comedians regularly invite audiences into their lives and heads, seeking to glean identifiable truths from their personal experiences. Because \"Expecting Amy\" offers such an intimate portrait, it's almost impossible to separate the project from the person, meaning one's interest level in Schumer going in will likely determine the extent to which this docuseries diary delivers.\"Expecting Amy\" premieres July 9 on HBO Max.

        "content": "(CNN)In a grand science fiction tradition, \"Don't Look Up\" uses a disaster-movie framework as a metaphor for a reality-based crisis, with a huge comet hurtling toward Earth as a surrogate for indifference to addressing climate change. Yet this star-studded, extremely provocative satire at times veers off course itself, partially undermining its admirable qualities with the broadness of its tone.At its core, writer-director Adam McKay (who wrote the script with journalist/activist David Sirota) delivers a very pointed treatise on the dysfunctional state of current politics and media, in which everyone is so myopic as to be unable to focus on an existential threat. The title reflects the inevitable endpoint of that, with a bury-your-head-in-the-sand approach to impending doom.The window into that absurdity comes when astronomy professor Randall Mindy (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his PhD. student Kate Dibiasky (Jennifer Lawrence) discover the comet, whose trajectory will lead to a direct collision with Earth in a little over six months.Understandably alarmed, their findings quickly reach the White House, where the president (Meryl Streep, poorly served by the ridiculousness of her character) is too preoccupied with her endangered Supreme Court pick to focus on what Randall describes as an extinction-level event. After fruitless back and forth, she concludes that they'll \"sit tight and assess\" the situation.From there, \"Don't Look Up\" is off to the races with a scathing indictment of everything about our media and political ecosystem, from the happy-talk news show (anchored by Tyler Perry and Cate Blanchett, standing out as especially self-absorbed TV anchors) to websites preoccupied with traffic and social-media memes.Read MoreMcKay and Sirota deliver a spot-on attack on how easily distracted people (especially in media) are, fixating on Kate's hair and clothes and ignoring the substance of her message.The attempts to make that point, however, careen wildly in different directions, from a tech billionaire (Mark Rylance, adopting a not-of-this-world accent) who sees opportunities to cash in on the comet's natural resources to the president's chief of staff (Jonah Hill), who can only see the threat in terms of how it might impact the midterm elections.Still, \"Don't Look Up\" keeps getting sidetracked, thanks in part to piling up celebrities in minor roles (witness Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet's belated entrance for no particular reason) and pursuing subplots that drag out the tension on whether these flawed leaders will find the fortitude and sobriety to take action.DiCaprio (whose climate-change activism included producing the documentary \"Ice on Fire\") and Lawrence are both very good, but many of the other bold-faced names basically serve as flashy and somewhat unnecessary window dressing. McKay's \"The Big Short\" and \"Vice\" represent his most obvious antecedents in tackling major institutions in a darkly satiric way, but the film owes a debt to \"Dr. Strangelove\" as well, casting its net wider with higher (indeed, the highest) stakes. The title certainly does a lot of heavy lifting, capturing the prevailing response to inconvenient news.As was clearly its intention, \"Don't Look Up\" uses satire to spur a conversation about potentially ignoring a crisis until it's too late. It's a sobering message, but one that comes barreling toward us through the lens of an uneven movie.\"Don't Look Up\" premieres Dec. 10 in select theaters and Dec. 24 on Netflix. It's rated R.",

        "content": "(CNN)Instead of a nifty chaser to the NBA Playoffs, \"The Last Dance\" -- which ESPN moved up by two months -- essentially fills that void, transporting viewers back to the off-court drama, flamboyant personalities and great basketball associated with Michael Jordan and the six-time champion Chicago Bulls. At 10 parts, it's a very, very deep dive, but for fans who will eat this stuff up, it hits all the right notes.The title refers to the Bulls' final title run in 1998, echoing the preseason handbook that coach Phil Jackson passed out to the team. With general manager Jerry Krause announcing that Jackson wouldn't be back and Jordan saying he would retire if that happened, it was a season-long campaign to put an exclamation point on the squad's greatness.The documentary series, meanwhile, alternately focuses not just on 1998, but all the previous dances, as well as individual dancers. That means taking extended detours into the lives of Dennis Rodman, Scottie Pippen (one of 12 children) and Jackson.Still, it's clear who the prima ballerina is here, and now as then, that's Jordan. Notoriously competitive, his tenacity and will to win are spoken of with awe by practically everyone who crossed his path during those years, but the centerpiece is extensive access to the man himself, who displays great candor in discussing his life and legacy.Directed by Jason Hehir, \"The Last Dance\" draws heavily on behind-the-scenes footage shot at the time, by an NBA Entertainment film crew allowed to chronicle the team throughout the season. There are also tantalizing glimpses of such things as Jordan and Magic Johnson trash-talking during a \"Dream Team\" practice game, or inside the locker room at an NBA All-Star Game, as Jordan and others snipe about a young ball hog on the opposing team name Kobe Bryant. (Bryant and Jordan later became close, and the late Lakers star is among those featured.)Read MoreThe current interviews -- from practically every basketball luminary imaginable -- are almost as good as the archival bounty. As further proof the filmmakers spoke to pretty much everybody, the documentary includes two former presidents: Bill Clinton, who reminisces about seeing Pippen play as a collegiate star in Arkansas; and Barack Obama, reflecting on Jordan regarding both his impact in Chicago and as an African American in the public spotlight, comparing him to Oprah Winfrey and Obama himself.Michael Jordan in 1997 (Photo by Alexander Hassenstein/Bongarts/Getty Images)In some respects, \"The Last Dance\" exists to remind the world of Jordan's greatness, and the level of stardom and adulation that surrounded him. That said, it's hardly a whitewash, underscoring the nasty streak that accompanied his drive for greatness.We see Jordan as a rookie -- joining a franchise that, we're told, was drawing fewer fans than indoor soccer -- talk about lifting the Bulls to a level rivaling the Lakers and Celtics, then hear Magic and Larry Bird marvel about Jordan's astonishing 63-point performance against the Celtics in the 1986 playoffs. Jordan also discusses how pre-title criticism that he was a great individual player but not a winner \"ate at me.\" Still, in regard to his scoring feats Jordan muses that while there's no \"I\" in team, \"There's an 'I' in win.\"Dennis Rodman (left) in the 1998 NBA playoffs. (Photo by Nathaniel S. Butler/NBAE via Getty Images)For all the basketball highlights, there's so much more going on here that even an NBA fan who lived through those years might not remember it all. That ranges from Pippen fuming about being underpaid to all of Rodman's outlandish antics to the murder of Jordan's father, and media coverage that probed whether the tragedy was somehow linked to revelations about Michael Jordan's gambling habit.To those who recall what it meant to \"Be like Mike\" (cue the jingle), \"The Last Dance\" is an intoxicating trip into the way-back machine. More broadly, though, the project is a thoughtful look at the costs associated with stardom and how they've evolved in the modern sports era, particularly in the NBA.Jordan wasn't the first hugely popular athlete, but like Magic and Bird, he became the image-conscious league's most powerful ambassador, with all the weight and expectations that entailed.Jordan, notably, in the present-day interviews repeats his stance that basketball should have been enough, explaining his reluctance to venture beyond it. As a famous example, the documentary considers his failure to publicly support North Carolina Senate candidate Harvey Gantt, an African American who ran against the notoriously racist Jesse Helms in 1990. A 1995 book reported that Jordan told friends, \"Republicans buy sneakers too,\" a quote he has disputed.ESPN will schedule two episodes each Sunday over five weeks (with an edited version, minus the profanity, on ESPN2), providing a welcome infusion of original programming on the network. It ranks among the channel's best documentary efforts since \"O.J.: Made in America,\" an even more ambitious 10-part exercise.As \"The Last Dance\" reminds us, this isn't the first time that Jordan and company have been a boon to ESPN and the sports world. And if it's not the same thrill as a live buzzer-beater for basketball fans, it's the next best dance partner one could hope to find.\"The Last Dance\" premieres April 19 at 9 p.m. ET on ESPN. It's available outside the US beginning April 20 on Netflix.",

        "content": "(CNN)For those enjoying the aerial displays of Golden State/Cleveland, ESPN provides a glorious reminder of the NBA's greatest rivalry in \"Celtics/Lakers: Best of Enemies,\" a five-hour documentary that wraps those memorable series in historical and sociological context. If it's not \"O.J.: Made in America\" in scope and impact, this high-scoring \"30 for 30\" effort is the next best thing.Director Jim Podhoretz employs a rather cheeky device by having Boston native Donnie Wahlberg and L.A.'s Ice Cube trade off narration duties, leveling pointed jabs at each other's preferred basketball teams. (Wahlberg, for example, dismisses the Lakers' home court of the \"Showtime\" 1980s, the Fabulous Forum, as \"The arena that doubles as a nightclub.\")The alternating approach, however, lends color to the rivalry, which, with the project's luxury of time, allows the participants to reminisce at length about, say, the classic 1984 NBA Finals. In addition, Podhoretz wisely punctuates the action with calls from Lakers and Celtics play-by-play announcers Chick Hearn and Johnny Most, two wildly distinctive voices whose homer-ism practically defined the emotion that surrounded these contests.\"That's a lousy rotten play!\" Hearn bellows, in that memorable moment when Kevin McHale clotheslined the Lakers' Kurt Rambis as he raced to the hoop on a fast break.\"Celtics/Lakers\" also devotes considerable time to the racial undertones that surrounded the teams and the NBA, with the flashy Lakers and their African-American stars going against the Celtics and their \"Great White Hope\" Larry Bird -- a description that Bird fastidiously rejected, but an unavoidable aspect of the rivalry at the time that was magnified by the Celtics' predominantly white squad, including the aforementioned McHale and Danny Ainge.Read MoreAlthough the 1980s showdowns are the focal point, \"Celtics/Lakers\" reaches back to provide context, recalling the Celtics' dominance during the Bill Russell/Jerry West era. That includes how Celtics mastermind Red Auerbach struck blows for civil rights by first choosing Russell and later naming him player/coach in 1966 -- the latter a first in major sports -- despite Boston's reputation as a city with deep racial divisions.The documentary also delivers a jarring reminder of how far the NBA has come as an enterprise, with the Bird-Johnson storyline fostering excitement around a league that struggled in the 1970s, with sluggish attendance widely attributed to white patrons resisting a sport featuring predominantly black stars.The Lakers and Celtics of the '80s \"saved the NBA,\" says \"Real Sports\" host Bryant Gumbel.Even die-hard fans will find tidbits here they didn't know or had perhaps forgotten: Bird being such an accomplished trash-talker that he would actually tell opponents what play they were going to run -- confident they couldn't stop him; Philadelphia fans chanting \"Beat L.A.!\" as Boston finished off their 76ers before heading west to face the Lakers; and the much-beloved Johnson being booed by hometown fans after he forced the firing of Coach Paul Westhead.Like the best \"30 for 30\" productions, \"Celtics/Lakers\" revels in the drama of sports while going well beyond it, tracing how the game has evolved along with the U.S., and basketball's relationship to society at large. (As a footnote, HBO's splendid 2010 documentary \"Magic & Bird: A Courtship of Rivals\" is an ideal companion piece.)Underlying it all, meanwhile, is the bond the 1980s teams shared, which comes across loud and clear in the interviews -- knowing they were part of something truly memorable and special. On that score, the Celtics and Lakers have earned their \"Best of Enemies\" label, and ESPN has produced a two-night event that's worthy of all the hoopla.\"Celtics/Lakers: Best of Enemies\" airs June 13-14 at 8 p.m. on ESPN.",

        "content": "(CNN)Success hasn't spoiled \"Succession,\" as the Emmy-winning drama returns with all its Shakespearean and Murdochian overtones intact, with a bruising father-son battle over its fictional media empire. Stripped of that, the HBO series remains enormously fun, filled with cringe-inducing moments and the kind of vicious insults that would make the writers of \"Veep\" blush.Having become HBO's version of \"Game of Thrones\" in sportscoats and loafers, the events of season two have left the company's future very much in doubt. That includes the real possibility that some of its executives could be going to jail -- a prospect that particularly obsesses Tom (Matthew Macfadyen, creating one meme-worthy scene after another), who laments, among other things, about the absence of \"fine wines\" in prison.The main event, however, again boils down to family patriarch Logan Roy (Brian Cox) and his son Kendall (Jeremy Strong), who wages a one-man war for control of Waystar, while seeking to pick off support from other members of his immediate and extended corporate family, testing the transactional nature of their loyalties.Amid all the twisted family dynamics, Kendall remains the awkward heart of the show, a guy desperate to prove that he can take a joke who looks profoundly uncomfortable when he hears one. His father, he notes rightly, isn't the indestructible figure he represented in the past, yet he's still plenty formidable, prompting Kendall to ask, \"Can I do this? Can I win?\"Series creator Jesse Armstrong essentially turns that question into a season-long proposition based on the seven episodes previewed, which again demonstrate an extraordinarily savvy ear for corporate deal-making but also politics, with Logan relishing his ability to influence the latter and eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck) still harboring vaguely delusional political ambitions.Read MoreWhile Armstrong has stressed that Rupert Murdoch and his progeny only serve as one of the inspirations for the series (there are plenty of eccentric media moguls and family dynasties), certain elements of this third season -- particularly in the later episodes previewed -- certainly evoke images of the News Corp. chairman, including influencing editorial matters to advance the company's interests.Perhaps most impressively, the new episodes set up plenty of tests for all of the Roys (and thus splendid showcases for the cast), including daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and son Roman (Kieran Culkin). Indeed, just the promise of being named a figurehead CEO -- as Logan contemplates stepping more into the shadows -- sets off a dizzying whirlwind of shifting alliances even by \"Succession\" brutal standards.Adrien Brody, Hope Davis and Alexander Skarsgard are among those who appear as major financial players in later episodes, as the Roys explore various options in their efforts to save the company.As with \"Veep,\" much of the dialogue is gleefully vulgar, and the episodes get better and better as the season progresses, from the backstage maneuvering at a shareholders meeting to an insanely over-the-top birthday party.\"Succession\" has no shortage of company in pulling back the curtain on the outwardly glamorous lives of the super-rich, exposing the insecurities and family grievances that lurk underneath.As for that \"Game of Thrones\" comparison, the battles on \"Succession\" don't leave a trail of bodies in their wake. But as meticulously constructed, the collateral damage associated with losing this game might be the next worst thing.\"Succession\" begins its third season Oct. 17 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of WarnerMedia.",

        "content": "New York (CNN Business)In the nearly six decades since 1962's \"Dr. No,\" one thing has been a constant at the cinema: Bond, James Bond.The iconic super-spy returns for his latest adventure this weekend with \"No Time to Die,\" the franchise's 25th film, which represents both a literal and figurative end of an era. \"No Time to Die\" is the final film for Daniel Craig, who has played the character five times since 2006's \"Casino Royale.\" Craig revitalized the character while also racking up some of the series' most significant box office totals.Yet \"No Time to Die\" debuts at an inflection point for both the Bond franchise and movie theaters as the industry attempts to return to normalcy in the face of the coronavirus pandemic and the rise of streaming. Bond as a brand is also at a crossroads, as tech giant Amazon (AMZN) plans to take over MGM, the home of the series.How \"No Time to Die\" performs this weekend and in coming weeks will have huge ramifications on the health of the theater industry and the future of 007.Read More\"The Bond franchise has always been done on a grand scale,\" Jonathan Kuntz, a film professor at UCLA School of Theater, Film and TV, told CNN Business. \"James Bond exemplifies the best in theatrical film.\"Kuntz added, \"Now, some are wondering in the 21st century, is there still space for that?\"Craig, Daniel Craig\"No Time to Die\" will be Daniel Craig's last performance as 007.\"No Time to Die\" is expected to bring in around $55 million to $60 million at the North American box office this weekend, estimates that are on the conservative side because of the pandemic. Given Craig's box office history, that total could be much higher.The James Bond franchise has racked up more than $7 billion worldwide, according to Comscore (SCOR). Of that total, Craig's outings as Bond (in \"Casino Royale,\" \"Quantum of Solace,\" \"Skyfall,\" \"Spectre\" and \"No Time to Die,\" which opened internationally last week) have brought in almost half that total, $3.3 billion. \"Daniel Craig's tenure has been one of the most beloved runs in the long history of 007,\" Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com, told CNN Business. \"He and the creative teams involved since 'Casino Royale' have made strides to modernize the franchise, and now they've had the chance to close their particular chapter on their terms.\"Daniel Craig explains why 'No Time to Die' is best experienced in a theater To be sure, Bond audiences skew much older than those who buy a ticket to see \"Venom: Let There Be Carnage,\" which made $90 million last weekend, and he doesn't have the Marvel name attached. But Bond is still Bond  \u2014 one of the most iconic characters in film history. Mix that with Craig's farewell performance and strong reviews (the film holds an 84% critic's score on Rotten Tomatoes), and the film's box office numbers could easily exceed expectations.Plus, the film has already made $121 million internationally so far and brought in $6.3 million in the US Thursday night, a solid start. For theaters, a big box office win for \"No Time to Die\" could keep the momentum going from the strong performance of \"Venom\" last weekend into the rest of October, which is vital if theaters want to keep moving in the right direction and go into 2022 strong. Other films have opened this year to mix results, but \"No Time to Die\" is arguably the most important film of the pandemic so far. If it's able to find an audience it could act as a bridge to a brighter future for theaters.\"There was a time in the '80s where it seemed like the James Bond films were going through the motions. But I think since 2006, each James Bond film has been carefully crafted,\" Kuntz said. \"It doesn't mean they've all been masterpieces, but they've given us something really new and visually stunning in the Bond films.\" Kuntz continued, \"The question is, is that enough? Is Bond enough? And if it's not, the theatrical film is in trouble.\"Bezos, Jeff BezosWhat will James Bond look like in the Amazon era?James Bond and wealthy, bald, technology-focused men have never really gotten along. (See the villain Blofeld in 1961's \"Thunderball.\") But now the spy will have to: his new boss is Jeff Bezos.Amazon purchased MGM, the studio behind Bond, for $8.4 billion in May. MGM, home to classic characters like Rocky Balboa and RoboCop, has more than 4,000 films and 17,000 TV shows in its catalog. Yet the biggest catch is Bond.The studio owns a piece of the spy franchise, which Eon Productions also controls. However, beyond Bond's box office prowess, the films and their lead character represent a lifestyle that spreads across the globe and throughout pop culture. Bond is more than a mere piece of intellectual property \u2014 it's a vibe.And while streaming is a small part of Amazon's empire, the company has become a more prominent player in the entertainment world.Bond ratings: The best and worst of 007 as 'No Time to Die' marks Daniel Craig's exitPrime Video is tied to Amazon's popular Prime program, which offers faster package delivery and has more than 200 million paid subscribers. That makes it a strong competitor in the streaming marketplace, and having Bond in its ranks will likely bolster that position.But what does this mean for the cinematic future of Bond?Producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, who hold the rights to the character, are adamant that 007 will stay in theaters. But that doesn't mean that Bond or other characters from the series like M, Q, or Moneypenny won't appear elsewhere, much as the Star Wars or Marvel universes have done so successfully.\"I would expect some branching out to occur, likely with spin-off series and crossovers that focus on periphery characters within the 007 universe,\" Robbins said. \"Ultimately, though, the health of the brand is best maintained by making sure it continues to evolve without sacrificing part of what made it uniquely great to begin with: movie theaters.\"",

In announcing the move, the Academy left key questions unaddressed, however. Particularly, how a movie would earn the distinction of being a so-called popular film and whether a movie could be nominated in both the popular film and best picture categories. Everyone from prominent film critics to celebrities like Rob Lowe criticized the move. Read More\"The film business passed away today with the announcement of the 'popular' film Oscar,\" Lowe wrote on Twitter. \"It had been in poor health for a number of years. It is survived by sequels, tent-poles, and vertical integration.\"At the time, the Academy did not clarify when the category would be added, but the body's announcement that the measure \"merits further study\" indicates it had been on track for addition in the upcoming Oscars cycle. The Academy's decision to extend honors to so-called popular films was largely considered a play for more viewers. The most-watched telecast in Oscars history was in 1998 when \"Titanic\" won.Last year's telecast hit an all-time low in ratings with just 26.5 million viewers, a drop of 20% from the previous year.The 91st Oscars will be held on Sunday, February 24, 2019.",

        "content": "(CNN)\"The Power of the Dog\" is such a delicately constructed movie as to almost defy the ability to review it without saying too much. Keeping the audience off balance, writer-director Jane Campion creates a slow, ominous build around the fine performances toward a satisfying conclusion that nicely pays off on the slow-canter ride.Marking the first film in 12 years from the director (who did do the TV series \"Top of the Lake\" in between), Campion has adapted a 1967 novel by Thomas Savage, set in Montana during the 1920s. While the western tone and subject matter has drawn comparisons to \"Brokeback Mountain,\" the story feels distinctive, and owes as much to Campion's signature movie \"The Piano\" with its strained relationships in a harsh, remote environment.The central tension stems from the bond between two brothers, who have grown up together on the family ranch but couldn't be more different. Phil (Benedict Cumberbatch) is tethered to the past and tradition, as well as vaguely sadistic in his treatment of his brother George (Jesse Plemons), a quiet sort who he persists in calling \"Fatso.\"When George abruptly announces he's marrying an attractive widow, Rose (Kirsten Dunst, again paired with her off-screen partner after \"Fargo\"), Phil responds terribly and treats his brother's bride abusively. That discourteousness that also extends to her son Peter (Kodi Smit-McPhee), who Phil sees as being effeminate and cruelly teases along with the other cowhands.Life on the ranch takes its toll on Rose, but she's understandably concerned when Peter returns from school and begins spending time with Phil, who has seemingly taken it upon himself to make a man out of the boy, while reminiscing about his own schooling from a cowboy known as Bronco Henry. Yet his motives and virtually everyone else's remain suspect, creating a sense of menace and tension that lingers throughout.Read MoreThe cast is uniformly good, though Cumberbatch has the showiest role as the intense, brooding cowboy, who fears and resents change or any of the social niceties to which his brother aspires. When George hosts guests, Phil bristles at the suggestion that he should clean up before dinner, tersely announcing, \"I stink. And I like it.\"Netflix clearly harbors awards aspirations for the movie, and the film earns a place in that conversation. At its core \"Power of the Dog\" probes questions of masculinity filtered through the Marlboro Man images of the past, as well as how both vulnerability and reservoirs of strength can come from unexpected sources. Like a cattle drive, it's an arduous process getting from here to there, but finally a rewarding one when the film reaches the finish.\"The Power of the Dog\" premieres in select US theaters on Nov. 17 and Dec. 1 on Netflix.

She wasn't wrong. \"Parasite\" picked up four awards on Sunday night, including a history-making best picture win.After she spoke, Miky Lee, a Korean entertainment mogul, attempted to take a turn at the mic, but the lights on stage dimmed as the camera prepared to return to Jane Fonda, who would close the night. But those in the audience protested, asking loudly from their seats for the stage directors to turn the lights back up and let Lee speak.Read MoreThey won, and she got her turn.'Parasite' cast and crew, accepting the award for best picture The film's Oscar campaign sort of played out in a similar way. If at any time it looked like the spotlight on \"Parasite\" might dim, it would shine again -- first a Palme d'Or award, then history-making SAG Award win, then a BAFTA and so on.In the end, the infectious buzz around the film, which centers on two families on opposite sides of South Korea's economic gap, turned out to be too powerful for its Oscar competitors, which included some of Hollywood's most seasoned filmmakers. \"Parasite\" is the first non-English film and first South Korean film to win best picture at the Academy Awards. It is also the first film to win both best international feature (a category previously called best foreign-language film) and best picture.Only 11 non-English language films have ever been nominated in the category. When asked after the ceremony by CNN's Stephanie Elam how he felt about the film's historic success, director Bong Joon Ho was still taking in the news. \"I think we destroyed the barrier too much!\" he joked, via translator Sharon Choi. \"I think it's great in life when things happen so fast and that's what's happening tonight.\"\"Parasite\" also picked up best director, best international feature film and best original screenplay. Heading into Sunday night, \"1917\" and \"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood\" had been considered major competition for the movie. The question on the minds of many in Hollywood had been whether the Academy would put its votes toward those films -- the likes of which have been recognized in the past (a war epic and a star-packed film from a beloved director) -- or honor a filmmaker and cast less familiar to the mainstream. With the win for \"Parasite,\" the Academy made a choice to honor a film unlike any of those honored in the past 91 ceremonies. It's a victory for a community that still struggles to be seen -- one that comes in a year that had been criticized for a lack of individual nominees of color. (Only one actor of color -- Cynthia Erivo, star of \"Harriet\" -- was nominated this year in the major acting categories.) Nancy Wang Yuen, a sociologist and author of \"Reel Inequality: Hollywood Actors and Racism,\" previously told CNN that \"Parasite\" earning best picture could open up opportunities for Asian-American actors, who have a difficult time getting their work recognized on the awards circuit. (For example, \"Crazy Rich Asians,\" which was a success at the box office and a milestone moment for Asian representation, but unsuccessful in its bid for Oscars recognition.)\"I think the fact that Asian Americans are rooting for 'Parasite' is because we still aren't even seeing ourselves in main dramatic roles,\" she said. \"The more Asians succeed on the international stage, I think Asian Americans do feel like that will then open up more opportunities for Asian-American actors in Hollywood.\"On social media, the win was hailed. Sandra Oh, who presented on Sunday night, said, \"Congratulations @ParasiteMovie So so proud to be Korean.\" \"The game has changed,\" wrote actor Lewis Tan. \"I'm in tears. This is historic.\" Actor Paul Sun-Hyung Lee, from \"Kim's Convenience\" added: \"Lookit all those Koreans onstage at the #Oscars. So proud my heart is bursting.\"",

        "content": "Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso (CNN)Burkina Faso's army said it took control of the country on Monday, deposing President Roch Kabore, dissolving the government and parliament, suspending the constitution and shuttering its borders.The coup was announced on state television by Captain Sidsore Kader Ouedraogo, who said the military had seized power in response to the \"ongoing degradation of the security situation\" in the country and the \"incapacity of the government\" to unite the population.Sitting alongside him dressed in military fatigues and a red beret was Lieutenant Colonel Paul-Henri Damiba, a senior military officer who was introduced to the people of Burkina Faso as their new leader.Damiba was promoted in December by Kabore to commander of the country's third military region, which is responsible for security in the capital Ouagadougou, according to Reuters. He studied at a military academy in Paris, and recently authored a book titled \"West African Armies and Terrorism: Uncertain Responses?\"There was no mention made in the televised statement about Kabore's whereabouts. The president has not been seen in public since fighting broke out on Sunday around the presidential palace in Ouagadougou. Read MoreOne of the coup leaders told CNN that Kabore was detained early Monday by soldiers that had taken control of a military base before storming the palace grounds and firing shots near the president's home. The same source said that Kabore signed his resignation and is being kept in a \"safe place\" in the West African country.Soldiers outside a military base in Burkina Faso's capital Ouagadougou Sunday. Witnesses reported heavy gunfire nearby, raising fears that a coup attempt was underway.But Kabore's exact location remains unknown; on Monday afternoon, a message was posted from his Twitter account asking those involved in the insurrection to lower their arms.\"Our nation is going through difficult times,\" the tweet said. \"We must in this precise moment, preserve our democratic achievements. I invite those who took arms to lower them in the superior interest of the nation. It is through dialogue and listening that we must resolve our contradictions.\"The United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres is concerned about the whereabouts of President Kabore and is following developments in Burkina Faso closely, his spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a Monday statement.Pictures from Ouagadougou on Monday showed armed vehicles and soldiers parked outside the headquarters of the state broadcaster, Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision du Burkina (RTB).Plans for the military coup have been underway since August, hatched in encrypted messaging apps and countless secret meetings held outside the capital, one of the coup leaders told CNN, adding that the soldiers are angry at the government's handling of jihadist attacks in the country, and believe Burkina Faso is better off under military rule right now.Civilians gathered on the streets honking car horns and cheering in support of the military following Monday's announcement. \"People are fleeing their homes and people are dying everywhere because of terrorism. The situation is not solved. If the army takes the lead I think things will go back to normal,\" said Oumar Junior Bahoro, who was protesting in downtown Ouagadougou.Why are coups making a comeback in Africa? The Economic Community for West Africa States (ECOWAS) posted a statement on Facebook Monday saying it was watching \"with great concern the political and security situation in Burkina Faso, following an attempted coup d'\u00e9tat.\"ECOWAS demanded that the \"soldiers return to the barracks, maintain a Republican situation and favor dialogue with the authorities to resolve problems,\" adding that it held the military responsible for Kabore's wellbeingOn Monday, the French embassy in Burkina Faso posted a message on its website warning its citizens in the country that the situation \"remains rather confusing.\"\"In the wait for a clarification, we recommend that you avoid non-essential movements during the day and do not go out at night,\" the message said.Two Air France flights scheduled for Monday evening were also canceled, according to the embassy.'Mounting dissatisfaction'Burkina Faso has been wracked with violence linked to the Islamic State and al Qaeda that has killed thousands and displaced 1.5 million people, according to UNHCR. The military has been hard hit; last month at least 50 security forces were killed in the Sahel.Anger has been mounting across the country for weeks. The coup comes one day after a protest in the capital demanding the president's resignation.\"This coup attempt isn't coming out of nowhere. It's building on mounting dissatisfaction within the population and security forces with the government's handling of the security crisis,\" said Constantin Gouvy, a Burkina Faso researcher who works for the Netherlands-based Clingendael Institute. Kabore has championed a military-first approach since being first elected in 2015 and it's not been successful, he said.Reuters reported that sustained gunfire rang out from military camps in the West African country on Sunday, as soldiers demanded more support for their fight against Islamist militants. Eight soldiers in Burkina Faso arrested for alleged plotProtesters came out to support the mutineers on Sunday and ransacked the headquarters of Kabor\u00e9's political party, according to the news agency.The government declared a curfew until further notice and closed schools for two days.The turmoil in Burkina Faso comes after successful military putsches over the past 18 months in its West African neighbors Mali and Guinea, where the army removed President Alpha Conde last September. West Africa, which until recently appeared to have shed its reputation as Africa's \"coup belt,\" remains susceptible to unrest.The military also took over in Chad last year after President Idriss Deby died on the battlefield there.Burkina Faso is one of the poorest countries in West Africa -- despite being a gold producer.Its army has suffered heavy losses at the hands of Islamist militants, who control swathes of the country and have forced residents in those areas to abide by their harsh version of Islamic law, Reuters reports.CNN's Sam Mednick reported from Ouagadougou and Niamh Kennedy reported from Dublin.

        "content": "(CNN)A college student has become a symbol of resistance in India's Karnataka state, where religious tensions are rising over the right to wear religious clothing to school.Muskan Khan was attempting to hand in a college assignment in the city of Mandya when she was accosted by a group of Hindu men wearing saffron scarves -- the color of India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) -- according to video posted to social media. \"They were not allowing me to go inside, just because I was carrying the burqa,\" she told local outlet channel NDTV. Khan had covered her head with a hijab, an Islamic headscarf, and was wearing a religious dress.The men heckle her as she makes her way across the school grounds, demanding she take off her face covering, but instead of complying, Khan shouts back \"Allahu Akbar\" as she punches her fist in the air. The confrontation illustrates the religious divide that's been widening in Karnataka since a group of girls began protesting outside their government-run school in January after they were denied entry in the classroom for wearing a hijab.Read MoreThe girls petitioned the state's top court to lift the ban, prompting rival protests from right-wing Hindu students.On Wednesday the court referred the petition to a larger panel of judges, but no date has been set for hearings. Activists say the hijab row is yet another example of a broader trend in India -- one that has seen a crackdown on India's minority Muslim population since Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP came to power nearly eight years ago. They say that by denying Muslim women the choice to wear the hijab, the government is denying them their religious freedoms, enshrined in the Indian constitution. \"This is a massive attempt by the BJP to homogenize Indian culture, to make it a Hindu-only state,\" said 23-year-old Muslim activist Afreen Fatima, who has been protesting in support of the students in her hometown of Allahabad in India's northern Uttar Pradesh state. \"Muslim women are isolated in India. And the situation is getting worse every day.\" The 'hijab row' What started as a small protest made national headlines after several other government-run educational institutions in Karnataka denied entry to students wearing hijabs.The protests have since spread to other cities. Scores of students took to the streets in India's capital Delhi this month holding placards and shouting slogans to express their anger at the ban. And hundreds more have protested in Kolkata and Hyderabad, Reuters reported. Indian Muslim woman shouts slogans during a protest in Delhi against the ban on Muslim girls wearing hijab in class.On Tuesday, BJP-ruled Karnataka ordered a three-day closure of all high schools and colleges amid the growing tensions. And on Wednesday authorities in the state's capital Bengaluru banned protests outside schools for two weeks.For many Muslim women, the hijab is an integral part of their faith. While it has been seen as a source of controversy in some western countries, in India it is neither banned, nor restricted from being worn in public places.  Karnataka's education minister B.C. Nagesh said he supported banning the hijab in educational institutions, citing the state's mandate on religious attire. \"Government is very firm that the school is not a platform to practice dharma (religion),\" he told CNN affiliate CNN News-18. But experts say the issue runs deeper than a dress code.Karnataka -- where just 13% of the population is Muslim -- is governed by the BJP.  According to lawyer Mohammed Tahir, who is representing one group of petitioners in court, Karnataka is a \"hotbed\" of the Hindutva ideology supported by many right-wing groups, which seeks to make India the land of the Hindus. Karnataka has banned the sale and slaughter of cows, an animal considered sacred to Hindus. It has also introduced a controversial anti-conversion bill, which makes it more difficult for interfaith couples to marry or for people to convert to Islam or Christianity. And according to Tahir, the lawyer, religious tension in the state will likely increase ahead of pivotal state elections next year. \"These issues (like the hijab ban) are very easy to polarize the entire community for votes,\" he said. In a statement Tuesday, the Indian Muslims for Secular Democracy said it \"strongly condemns the attempt by Hindutva forces and the BJP government of Karnataka to engulf college and school campuses in the already raging communal fire in the state.\"\"College campuses have thus been transformed into yet another playing field for the BJP and other right-wing Hindu majoritarians,\" the statement said. CNN has attempted to contact the state authorities but did not receive a response. Muslim women further targeted The hijab row follows a string of online attacks against Muslim women in India. In early January, the Indian government was investigating a website that purported to offer Muslim women for sale. It was the second time in less than a year that a fake online auction of that kind sparked outrage in the country.\"They came for us online,\" said Fatima, who was featured on the online app. \"Now, they are directly targeting our religious practice. It started in one college, and grew. I have no reason to believe it will end there.\"  On Tuesday, Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai, called the hijab row \"horrifying.\" \"Objectification of women persists -- for wearing less or more. Indian leaders must stop the marginalisation of Muslim women,\" she wrote on Twitter.The All India President of the Students' Federation of India, V P Sanu, criticized the hijab ban, saying it was used \"as a reason to deny Muslim women's right to education.\"Modi referred briefly to Muslim women in a speech in Uttar Pradesh Thursday as that state started voting in local elections.The Prime Minister said his government \"stands with every victim Muslim woman.\" He didn't refer to the hijab ban but said the government gave Muslim women \"freedom\" by scrapping the controversial Muslim practice of triple talaq, which allows a Muslim man to divorce his wife by simply saying the Arabic word for divorce, \"talaq\", three times. The Indian government criminalized the practice in 2019. Khan, the student who yelled at the Hindu men, said she was defending her religious rights.\"Every religion has freedom, India is a unity...every religion has freedom,\" Khan told reporters Wednesday. \"They are following their culture and I am following my culture. They should let us follow our culture and not raise any obstacle.\"CNN's Esha Mitra contributed reporting",

        "content": "New Delhi, India (CNN)The call to prayer rings out through the crowded, bustling streets of Old Delhi -- a maze of chaotic streets full of honking scooters, shouting rickshaw wallas, vendors selling jewelery and eateries laden with sweet delicacies. Set away from the din of the street through narrow alleys and stone stairs flanked by old buildings with ornate facades is the house of 65-year-old Alauddin, who goes by one name, his four sons and their families. They can trace their relatives back to the Mughal Empire, which ruled India between 1526 and 1857. The time ticks past 7 p.m. and the family is settling down on the floor to break their fast with iftar, the first meal eaten after sunset during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, or Ramzan in India.  Dates are eaten first followed by deep fried cheese, potatoes and a spicy dish of curried apple, melon, and lentils washed down with iced strawberry milk. It's a fun and loving family atmosphere, with some of Alauddin's five grandchildren running about and giggling as their pet birds chirp in their cages, and the adults discuss their fourth-generation family sweet shop.Read More\"We eat, all of us together,\" said Alauddin's oldest son Adnan Qureshi, 39. \"We feel good when they all come, everyone sits and has a laugh.\"Mateen's family sit down to break their fast with iftar in Old Delhi. But conversation soon turns to politics. On May 23, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi won another landslide victory in the country's mammoth general elections. He'll be sworn in as Prime Minister again on Thursday, ushering in another five years of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rule.While much of the country celebrated the stunning victory of a man who has promised economic reform and development, others, especially minorities and liberals, have grown increasingly concerned about the impact of the BJP's Hindu nationalist background on the country's secular fabric. The BJP has its roots in the right wing-Hindu group Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) -- of which Modi is a member -- and many of its members are adherents of the Hindutva ideology that promotes a Hindu-first India. It's a stance that worries liberals and minorities, including more than 170 million Indian Muslims in a country of 1.3 billion people. \"There are a lot of effects (from nationalism), majorly on Muslims and it's going to get worse,\" Alauddin said.The family, who live in Old Delhi's Muslim majority neighborhood, said they have not experienced any communal tension here. The community is strong, with Hindus and Muslims living and working together for generations, they said. But they are concerned that the social fabric may change with the BJP in power for five more years.\"There is no violence in Delhi, but there is a possibility it might happen now,\" said Mateen, 35, the youngest son who, like his father, uses just his first name. Some members of India's Muslim community say they don't feel safe traveling to other towns and villages.Attacks on Muslims and minoritiesAttacks under the name of \"cow protection\" have risen since Modi came to power, according to a Human Rights Watch report. The group said that between May 2015 and December 2018, 44 people suspected of killing or transporting cows for slaughter, or even just eating beef, were killed in vigilante attacks. That number included 36 Muslims.Human Rights Watch said many of the murders went unpunished in part due to delayed police investigations and \"rhetoric\" from ruling party politicians, which may have incited mob violence.\"Muslims are scared, very scared,\" said Alauddin. \"The cow protectors, what they have done in all these places. Muslims are affected.\"In Old Delhi, Mateen said goats and buffalo used to be slaughtered in the neighborhood, but no longer. \"Everything has to go to the slaughterhouse and then the meat is transported here. They are shifting the slaughter house further away,\" Mateen said.It's not just cow vigilantes that are cause for concern, according to activists. Human Rights Watch South Asia director Meenakshi Ganguly points to a larger theme of right wing nationalists targeting anyone they disagree with, saying many Indians -- not just Muslims -- now fear a \"culture of mob violence.\" \"BJP's supporters have attacked people whether it is to oppose an inter-community relationship, or because they claim to be protecting cows, or simply for their religious identity. They have also disrupted meetings, book readings or film screenings, and threatened activists, because they are 'offended,' and declared that opposing views are 'anti-national,'\" she said.In August, Modi condemned the vigilante attacks and has called on the states to prevent mob violence. \"I want to make it clear that mob lynching is a crime, no matter the motive,\" Modi said. \"No person can, under any circumstances, take the law into his own hand and commit violence.\"Yet reports of mob attacks continue. Minorities and liberals have grown increasingly concerned about the impact of the BJP's Hindu nationalist background on India's secular fabric. The violence has cast a pall over many communities and the family said, though they haven't been impacted themselves, they will not take what they see as a risk and travel.\"We are not safe going to other towns or villages,\" said Mateen. \"We are not safe. We see in the news, it's very scary actually. That's why we won't go.\"Yusuf Qureshi, president of the Muslim All India Jamiatul Quresh Action Committee, which provides legal aid and support to India's Muslims, said the problems faced by minorities under Modi run deep. \"They are closing all opportunities for us -- education, employment -- all the doors are being shut.\" He repeated Modi's motto used during campaigning, \"Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas,\" which means \"everyone together, development together.\"\"If you want us together with you, then give us development also,\" he said. Rise of right-wing groupsIn 2014, Modi was elected with a massive mandate to reduce corruption and create jobs. He also promised to be a champion of minorities.But the appointment of hardline nationalists to key posts during his first term had observers questioning these promises. In 2017, Yogi Adityanath was made chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, the largest and key election state with almost 40 million Muslims. Adityanath, a hardline Hindu ascetic who is known for anti-Muslim comments, has called for India to become a Hindu state, and has expressed views against inter-faith marriage.BJP President and Modi's right hand man Amit Shah called Muslim migrants from Bangladesh \"infiltrators\" and \"termites\" and promised to \"remove every single infiltrator from the country, except Buddha, Hindus and Sikhs.\"India's minorities fear return of ModiHe promised to do so by implementing the National Register of Citizens nationwide. The NRC is a hugely controversial policy mooted last year in Assam, a region of India which shares a porous border with Bangladesh.Meanwhile, the BJP-picked Pragya Singh Thakur, who was elected to Parliament in recent elections, and is currently facing terrorism charges connected to a bomb attack on Muslims several years ago. Thakur denies the charges.The BJP has portrayed the case against her as a conspiracy by its opponents to tar the country's Hindu community. However, as campaigning ended in the 2019 election, Thakur made headlines again when local media quoted her as calling the hardline Hindu who murdered independence leader Mahatma Gandhi a patriot.The party censured her and initiated disciplinary action, she apologized and Modi, speaking to a local television network, said he would never be able to forgive her. But she remains one of the BJP's flag-bearers.\"They are all very dangerous people are running India,\" said Alauddin. Modi's own track record with the Muslim community has come under intense scrutiny. A few months after Modi assumed office in Gujarat in late 2001, the state was rocked by riots, in which more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed.Modi was criticized for not doing enough to halt the violence, but was not charged with a crime. The US State Department denied Modi a visa in 2005 over the issue.There are fears among minorities and activists that another five years of Modi will embolden right wing Hindu groups, which observers say have become more vocal during Modi's first term.Alauddin fears the right wing will grow. \"When they come to power, nobody is going to move them. They can do anything -- whatever they like.\" Human Rights Watch's Ganguly said the old Delhi family is not alone in its fears. \"There is great concern that Hindu extremists engage in violence because they believe they enjoy political patronage,\" she said. \"It is for the state to uphold rule of law, including to take action against those that might back the ruling party's political ideology.\"Speaking to members of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance in parliament's Central Hall this week, Modi promised to win the trust of minorities.\"Vote bank politics created this imagined fear, this imagined atmosphere and an environment of dread was created,\" he said. \"In 2019, I am coming to you responsibly with a certain expectation; I am standing in front of the constitution with my head bowed and making this plea to you. We need to break this deception.\"India's Modi made the election a referendum on his leadership -- and it paid off But Yusuf Qureshi questioned whether Modi has the will, or even the power, to halt the right-wing or extremist elements of his support base. \"He has said these things but the organizations associated with the BJP -- which harass us -- they are not under his control it seems. Every day we see incidents circulating on social media where minorities are being beaten and abused, he should be able to control them and punish them,\" said Yusuf Qureshi.\"Based on the past five years, I think there is no point in trusting unless he does something substantial -- gives us educational opportunities, gives us employment.\"Ultimately, the family is concerned about what kind of India their children will grow up in.\"They are not secure,\" said Adnan Qureshi, of the Old Delhi family. \"We are worried about our next generation and their next generation. They are not at all secure in any means. If Hindutva comes, then we have no means to live. No power, nothing.\"  CNN's Nikhil Kumar and Manveena Suri contributed.",

        "content": "(CNN)Mama Diakit\u00e9 is 23, and has been playing club football for the past 10 years. But all of that could change, she says, if a ban on wearing the hijab while playing sports proposed by the French senate becomes law. \"It almost means the end of soccer for me,\" Diakit\u00e9, a member of Paris based Les Hijabeuses, a collective of young hijab-wearing female footballers campaigning against the ban, and fighting what they describe as the exclusion of Muslim women from sports. Paris based Les Hijabeuses are a collective of young hijab-wearing female footballers tackling what they say is exclusion of Muslim women from sports.The French senate in January voted 160 to 143 to ban the wearing of the hijab and other \"ostensible religious symbols\" in sports competitions following a proposed amendment from Les R\u00e9publicains, a right wing party who argued that headscarves can risk the safety of athletes wearing them. Les R\u00e9publicains Senator Jaqueline Eustache-Brinio said that the French government must have the \"courage\" to resist what she described as the \"Islamist grip\" on the country -- something her party believes has taken hold in both sport and education. \"We must have the courage, wherever possible to do so, to preserve the unity and cohesion of the Republic,\" she told  RMC, radio partner of CNN affiliate BFMTV.Read MoreAn estimated five million people make up France's Muslim population, the largest in Europe.\"Sport and school are two places that we must preserve and for which we must resist. Sport is a place where -- whether you are rich or poor, black or white, atheist or believer -- we can practice together and have shared time,\" she said. \"What we want to do is apply the article of the Olympic charter that exists, but that no one wants to hear. Article 50 specifies that in sport, it is neither a political nor a religious element. I think that in sport and in sporting competitions, we have to maintain neutrality until the end.\"Numerous athletes have competed in the hijab at the Olympic Games, and various headscarf designs have been developed to allow Muslim women to safely compete with their heads covered.Vogue France says 'yes to the headscarf.' Some Muslim women are not happyMuslim women in France already face restrictions on what they can wear in certain places. The full Islamic veil (burqa and niqab) has been banned from public places -- including streets, public transport, shops, hospitals, and cinemas -- in France since April 2021, following a law prohibiting the concealment of the face in the public space. Several other countries, including Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark followed with their own bans, partial bans and local bans of face coverings.The hijab -- a general term for all modest dress, which is also synonymous with a headscarf that covers a woman's hair in the West -- is authorized in all public areas in France, with the exception of public schools, middle schools and high schools, following a 2004 law, which prohibits the wearing of religious symbols deemed \"conspicuous\" in schools. Mama Diakit\u00e9, 23, part of Les Hijabeuses, says talent should be recognised -- not what women wear on their heads.Foun\u00e9 Diawara, 22, of Les Hijabeuses, says the veil should not be seen as a \"political flag.\"Now, some politicians are taking further aim at sports. The French Football Federation already bans women from wearing the hijab in official matches and competitions -- despite FIFA sanctioning the wearing of them in 2014 after a seven-year ban.On Monday, the senate conceded that bitter disagreement amongst lawmakers over the proposed ban would prevent the bill from being passed in its current state.It expressed \"regret\" over the government's \"lack of will\" to put a stop to what they described as the \"development of Islamism in sport.\"The law will now be revised by the National Assembly, which is expected to have the final word.Nicolas Cadene -- co-founder of \"Vigie La\u00efcit\u00e9,\" an organization that works on a better understanding of French secularism known as la\u00efcit\u00e9 -- explained that over the past few years, France has witnessed \"strong tensions between those who want to distance themselves from religion and those who want to affirm it, especially when it comes to Islam.\"Cadene told CNN that the veil is being politically \"instrumentalized\" by a part of the French political class that wants to show that it is \"tougher and more firm when it comes to la\u00efcit\u00e9,\" especially when it comes to Islam and the veil -- a religious symbol that \"is misunderstood by the public.\" Secularism is deeply ingrained in French culture, with many believing that nothing -- not even one's religion -- should come before national identity.He added that there was \"a confusion between the practice of Islam as a religion and radicalism,\" which some politicians are taking advantage of to portray themselves as defending a French identity threatened by foreigners.\"It's terrible because the French Muslims are not foreigners, and there is not one single French identity,\" he added.Gendered IslamophobiaCritics of the bill say that far from maintaining neutrality in sports, ongoing discussions surrounding Muslim dress and so-called claims of women's emancipation and integration in French society are simply \"gendered Islamophobia.\"With the French presidential election looming this year, the proposed bill is just a part of a wider ongoing debate in the larger political sphere about secularism, freedom of speech and religious equality.\"Excuses of 'we want la\u00efcit\u00e9 and we want secularism' -- they're really a shield, because they don't apply fairly to the men performing crosses before they step onto the pitch,\" Shireen Ahmed, senior contributor with CBC Sports, told CNN.\"They don't apply to footballers who do that, even within the French league. So where are the rules about this, where half the Paris Saint-Germain F.C. does it [making the sign of the cross] before they step onto the pitch. Where's the consistency here?\" she said. \"It's a deliberate exclusion.\"Cadene said the new amendment does not include gestures, which shows its objective is \"political and only targets the veil.\"\"La\u00efcit\u00e9 is being wrongly put forward, it only assumes the neutrality of those who practice a public service, or students in public schools but not sports,\" he said. \"Secularism is for those who represent the state only -- when you are in service.\"Fatima Bent, head of French feminist and anti-racist organization Lallab, told CNN that \"this argument of banning the hijab has nothing to do with liberation, helping Muslim women, and nothing to do with sports conditions. French President Emmanuel has called colonialism a \"grave mistake.\"\"This discourse stems from this colonial European approach where Muslim women are always depicted as women to save: from their families, their origin, who have to deny their identities to assimilate.\"\"It is a continuation of a story of a European colonial power that asserts dominance, asserts that Muslim women submit, and considers them as inferior,\" she added. France is paying the price for normalizing IslamophobiaThe French held colonies in various forms from the 17th century, mainly in Africa and Southeast Asia, losing much of its overseas territory after World War II as independence movements around the world gained strength.France under President Emmanuel Macron has sought to reckon with its colonial past, with the president previously calling colonialism a \"grave mistake\" and a fault of the republic.An anti-hijab amendment was proposed last year by a group of right-wing senators as part of a law \"against separatism.\" The National Assembly, which had the final say on the bill, rejected it, and is expected to reject that amendment once again this year. Macron's party is opposed to the hijab ban in sports, as is sports minister Roxana Maracinenau.But even if the amendment is not implemented and is not voted through, it will have a great effect, Bent said.

Worldwide, critics say restrictive legislation is further blocking Muslim women's access to sports.  \"I was hoping to become the first Bangladeshi girl to represent England on the England International team, but unfortunately that didn't happen,\" UK based former professional soccer player Lipa Nessa told CNN. \"My dreams were cut short.\"Football's world governing body FIFA enforced a 2007 ban on headscarves -- and it wasn't until seven years later in 2014 that they were sanctioned. Meanwhile, the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) changed its rules to allow players to wear religious head coverings during games only as recently as 2017Elite male athletes play in shorts and tank tops, women basically in bikinis\"People around me were telling me that they would have to check if I would be allowed to play competitively, because it was still new,\" Nessa told CNN. Nessa was eventually allowed to play football, but says her negative experiences in the sport caused her to give up on her dreams of playing professionally.She told CNN that when she was 16 and playing semi-professionally, \"the parents of the opposition started making airplane noises, booing me, and started making other noises that I don't really want to mention, but they were in relation to attacks that have happened during my lifetime, unfortunately.\" Diawara, who was excluded from a French soccer field at the age of 15, told CNN: \"Even without this amendment, there is a real impact for girls and women who want to do sports. We have many, many testimonies of women and girls who tell us I want to do sports, but I do not know if I can because I wear the hijab.\"It's a sentiment echoed by Nazma Khan, the founder of the World Hijab Day organization, who says that placing regulations on women's bodies and how women choose to dress could prevent them from pursuing their passions. \"Countries like France talk about women's empowerment, but when it comes to Muslim women, they are going backwards by marginalizing Muslim women through hijab bans,\" Khan told CNN ahead of World Hijab Day on February 1.Some advocates of the bill say they are doing so in support of women's freedoms, but this is a view contested by some Muslim women.Meanwhile, Ahmed told CNN that \"forcing women out of clothing is as violent as forcing them into it.\"\"What kind of feminism is a feminism that ignores the voices of the women it's affecting? That's violence, that's oppressive in its very nature: you don't get to decide for someone what their religious beliefs are or constitute,\" Ahmed said. If they are unable to dress modestly, Muslim women could choose not to participate in sports, because it would contradict their religious beliefs, or affect their safety, she added.\"I think that itself is a shame for society.\" Joseph Ataman, Camille Knight and Xiaofei Xu contributed to this report from Paris.",

France must now report to the committee within 180 days on the actions it has taken to implement the panel's decision.In 2014 the European Court of Human Rights rejected a claim by a young Muslim woman that France's ban violated her rights.Denmark and the Netherlands have passed similar bans on face-covering garments since the French law came into effect, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for legislation to do the same.But a further ban on the burkini, a full-length swimsuit worn by some Muslim women, in the French city of Nice was overturned by a regional court after attracting criticism worldwide.",

        "content": "Copenhagen, Denmark (CNN)Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in the Danish capital of Copenhagen wearing burqas and other face veils Wednesday to protest a law against facial coverings, saying the legislation oppresses some Muslim women and violates their rights.Denmark joins several other European nations restricting face coverings. France banned the full face veil in 2011, while Belgium, Austria, the Netherlands and parts of Switzerland have restrictions in place. Other European countries have debated the issue.Protester Sabina says the law will radically change her life. The Danish law was passed in May and came into effect Wednesday, meaning people found wearing facial coverings in public could be fined from 1,000 Danish krone ($157), for a first offense, up to 10,000 krone ($1,565) for a fourth violation.Several women wearing niqabs -- which fully cover the body but leave the eye area open -- said this would make it very difficult for them to leave their homes, whether to take their children to school, grocery shop, or just move around their communities. The burqa covers the entire body and has mesh in the eye area. A Muslim protester -- Sabina, who gave only her first name and wears a niqab -- said it would have \"huge consequences\" on her life. Read More\"Every time I step outside my front door, I am a criminal. I have to stay in my house, isolated. I cannot go to the grocery store, I cannot go out,\" she told CNN. \"Wearing this is an important spiritual choice for me. And now it is also a sign of protest.

Anything from ski masks and fake beards to scarves covering the face could be seen as illegal. Police said they would not enforce the ban during Wednesday's protest because people had the right to demonstrate.Critics of the law also point out the small number of women who actually wear the veil in Denmark -- only around 150 to 200 Muslim women wear the niqab or the burqa on a daily basis, according to a University of Copenhagen study. Muslims account for about 5% of Denmark's population of 5.7 million.Sasha Andersen, a spokeswoman for the Party Rebels political group that organized the protest, called on the government to rescind the law. \"It moves us in a direction that is far more discriminatory and it limits people's freedom with something as commonplace as clothing,\" she said. Protesters gathered in Norrebro, a neighborhood known for its cultural diversity, and marched through the city's streets to the Bellahoej Police station less than a mile away, shouting: \"No racists in our streets.\" Protesters form a human chain around a police station. They formed a human chain  around the large police station, as several police officers protected the building.Martin Henriksen, an MP from the Danish People's Party, which proposed the ban, said he was very pleased with the progress of the law. \"The burqua and niqab are the purest form of extremism. This is a battle again fundamentalism. As a society, we are showing what we are willing to accept,\" he said.  \"We believe this is an important step for our country and we hope it will inspire other countries to do the same. It is irreconcilable with Danish culture and values.\"He added that in the future his party also hoped to see the banning from schools of Islamic headscarves that leave the face visible.CNN's Angela Dewan wrote from London.

        "content": "New Delhi (CNN)The appointment of a polarizing Hindu religious leader as the next chief minister of an Indian state with almost 40 million Muslims has raised concerns about the country's direction under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).  After BJP swept Uttar Pradesh elections in a landslide last week, taking 75% of available seats, Yogi Adityanath became head of the state's government. Adityanath is known for his provocative rhetoric against Muslims, including once vowing in a speech about inter-faith marriage that \"If the Muslims take away a Hindu girl, we will take away 100 Muslim girls.\"Uttar Pradesh is India's most populous state with 204 million people -- nearly a fifth of which are Muslim.Adityanath, 44, is head priest of a Hindu temple in Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh's northeast, and five-time member of parliament for the district. Read MoreWhile he is popular with many Hindus, his appointment caught many by surprise, said Shekhar Gupta, a veteran political journalist and former editor of the Indian Express newspaper who currently hosts \"Walk the Talk\", a political interview talk show on NDTV24x7.\"There was a great degree of polarization in this election,\" Gupta said. \"The Hindu vote is divided on the basis of caste, and the challenge (for BJP) was to try and use faith to reunite what caste has divided.\" BJP has defended Adityanath's appointment, with BJP minister and spokesman Venkaiah Naidu saying in a statement that the new chief minister \"is a strong politician and committed to (helping) the downtrodden.\"      Unity and developmentSince coming to power in 2014, Modi and the BJP have focused on fiscal growth and development. In the run-up to its record-breaking win in Uttar Pradesh this month, the BJP campaigned on a promise of \"sabka saath, sabka vikas,\" which loosely translates to \"unity together, development together.\" But for some, Modi's backing of Adityanath raises the specter of Hindutva, an ideology which considers India a Hindu nation. The Indian constitution established the country as a secular republic.\"The BJP campaigned on several issues and 'development' was only one of them,\" said Firat Unlu, lead India analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).\"The choice of Adityanath makes sense as it will help solidify the BJP's gains among the Hindu population and the Hindutva plank was arguably more important than the 'development' agenda in UP.\"Multiple BJP figures have said Muslim support for the party was key to their victory in the state. However, concerns have been raised over how willing Adityanath's government will be to reach out to Muslim residents. In recent years, there have been numerous religious and communal clashes in the state. According to an investigation by the Hindustan Times, of the 11,000 incidents of communal violence in Uttar Pradesh since 2012, around 23% were sparked by \"religious intolerance.\" Photos: Uttar Pradesh: 100 million Indians to cast vote in pivotal electionsA supporter of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) attends an election rally for leader Mayawati in February, 2017.

Hinduism is not India,\" he told the Press Trust of India news agency. In a statement, Congress said it accepted it was the right of the ruling part to appoint the chief minister but vowed to act \"as (a) watchdog of people's interests.\" Gupta, the political commentator, said \"if I was a Muslim in UP today, I'd be feeling very unwanted.\" He accused the BJP of discounting non-Hindu supporters and choosing a \"divisive\" candidate. \"We thought that (Modi), who had insisted that this was a vote for development and for equality, would have come up with a more modern leader than Yogi Adityanath,\" Gupta said.Representatives for the BJP and Adityanath did not immediately respond to a request for comment. OutspokenAdityanath has staunch views on the slaughter of cows, an animal considered sacred by Hindus. He also has a history of controversial statements having reportedly told those who oppose yoga to leave the country or drown themselves, and, according to media reports, claiming at a religious rally in 2016 that Mother Teresa was part of a conspiracy to \"Christianize India.\" He also once compared Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan to Hafiz Saeed, the alleged planner of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, according to the Press Trust of India.In January, he praised US President Donald Trump's travel ban barring citizens of several Muslim-majority countries and called for India to take similar measures, according to NDTV. On Monday, Amnesty International India called on Adityanath to retract his previous statements. \"Adityanath has been one of Uttar Pradesh's most polarizing politicians, given to hateful rhetoric that incites discrimination and hostility against minority groups, particularly Muslims,\" said executive director Aakar Patel.\"He (Adityanath) and his party have an obligation to ensure that his positions do not become government policy. It is therefore imperative that he retracts any statements which may provide a license for others to abuse human rights.\"     A calculated risk Modi congratulated Adityanath on Twitter, writing that he had \"immense confidence\" the new team \"will leave no stone unturned\" in developing Uttar Pradesh (UP). \"Our sole mission and motive is development,\" Modi said on Twitter. \"When UP develops, India develops. We want to serve UP's youth and create opportunities for them.\" \u00a0I have immense confidence that this new team will leave no stone unturned in making UP Uttam Pradesh. There will be record development.\u2014 Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) March 19, 2017\nFollowing his swearing-in on Sunday, Adityanath said his government will work for all sections of society without any discrimination.\"His appointment was a \"calculated risk that will polarize voters but could pay off electorally,\" said EIU's Unlu. \"Having raised expectations for economic development so high the BJP needs to advance on its 'development' platform,\" he said. \"A stronger coordination between the central and UP governments could drive economic growth while Adityanath ensures that the base remains happy.\"Editor's note: This story has been updated for clarity.",

        "content": "Delhi, India (CNN)At a conference in India last month, a Hindu extremist dressed head-to-toe in the religion's holy color, saffron, called on her supporters to kill Muslims and \"protect\" the country. \"If 100 of us become soldiers and are prepared to kill 2 million (Muslims), then we will win ... protect India, and make it a Hindu nation,\" said Pooja Shakun Pandey, a senior member of the right-wing Hindu Mahasabha political party, according to a video of the event. Her words and calls for violence from other religious leaders were met with a roar of applause from the large audience, a video from the three-day conference in the northern Indian city of Haridwar shows.But across India, people were outraged. Nearly a month on, many are still furious at the lack of government response or arrests over the comments, which they say highlights a worsening climate for the country's Muslims. After mounting pressure, India's top court intervened on Wednesday, asking for a response from state and federal authorities within 10 days.Read MorePandey and several others are being investigated by local police for insulting religious beliefs, a charge that carries a possible sentence of up to four years in prison, Haridwar police officials told CNN.Neither Pandey, nor the others, have publicly commented about the outcry or investigations.Late Thursday, police in Uttarakhand state, where Haridwar is located, arrested a man who spoke at the event, senior Haridwar Police official Shekhar Suyal told CNN. It is unclear what the man said at the event. Police have not formally charged anyone with any crime. CNN has contacted India's Ministry of Minority Affairs, the Hindu Mahasabha and Pandey, but has not received a response.In Hindu-nationalist India, Muslims risk being branded infiltrators in their own countryAnalysts say the Hindu Mahasabha is at the tip of a broader trend in India which has seen an alarming rise in support for extremist Hindu nationalist groups since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power nearly eight years ago. Although these groups aren't directly associated with Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), his own Hindu nationalist agenda, and the lack of repercussions for these groups' previous vitriolic comments, has given them tacit support, making them even more brazen, analysts say.  Analysts fear this rise poses a serious danger to minorities, especially Muslims -- and worry it may only get worse as several Indian states head to the polls in the coming months. \"What makes the Hindu Mahasabha dangerous,\" said Gilles Verniers, an assistant professor of political science at Ashoka University near India's capital, New Delhi, \"is that they have been waiting for a moment like this in decades.\"Rise of the right-wing Hindu groupFounded in 1907 during British rule at a time of growing conflict between Muslims and Hindus in the country, the Hindu Mahasabha is one of India's oldest political organizations. The group didn't support British rule, but it didn't back India's freedom movement either, led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who was particularly tolerant of Muslims. Even now, some members of the group worship his assassin, Nathuram Godse.The Hindu Mahasabha's vision, according to the group's official website, is to declare India the \"National Home of the Hindus.\" The website says if it takes power, it will not hesitate to \"force\" the migration of India's Muslims to neighboring Pakistan and vows to reform the country's education system to align it with their version of Hinduism. With its controversial campaigns and ideology, Hindu Mahasabha has always been a marginal political force. The last time the group had a presence in Parliament was in 1991. India is investigating a fake website that offered Muslim women for saleBut according to Verniers, their \"strength is not to be measured in electoral terms.\" And in the past eight years since Modi came to power, they appear to have expanded in numbers and influence based on the size and frequency of their meetings, he said.While the group does not publicly disclose how many members it has, Verniers said they are \"comfortably in the tens of thousands.\"Hindu Mahasabha targets rural communities in northern states, where there is a large BJP presence, encouraging them to vote for parties that align with their Hindu-nationalist ideology, including Modi's BJP, Verniers said. Modi, in turn, has publicly honored the Hindu Mahasabha's late leader, Veer Savarkar, for \"his bravery\" and \"emphasis on social reform.\" Nathuram Godse's statue is adroned with a garland at the Hindu Mahasabha office in New Delhi.And as Hindu Mahasabha has grown in recent years, it has become more outspoken.In 2015, Sadhvi Deva Thakur, then a senior member of the group, caused widespread controversy when she told reporters Muslims and Christians should undergo forced sterilization to control their population growth. CNN has reached out to her for comment. Pandey, who spoke at the December conference in Haridwar, was arrested in February 2019 after a video showed her shooting an effigy of Gandhi, according to CNN affiliate CNN News-18. Photos uploaded to her official Facebook page last May show her worshiping a statue of Gandhi's assassin. CNN has not been able to confirm whether she was formally charged over the February 2019 incident. Hindu Mahasabha isn't the only right-wing Hindu nationalist group to espouse violent sentiment toward liberals and minorities -- including India's 200 million Muslims, who make up 15% of the country's 1.3 billion population.At last month's conference, several speakers called on India's Hindus to \"defend\" the religion with weapons. Another called for the \"cleansing\" of India's minorities, according to video from the event. But according to Verniers, Hindu Mahasbha one of the largest right-wing political groups aiming to make India the land of the Hindus.And while the group's campaigns and ideas are decades old, they're more bold about them now. \"The escalation of their hate speech is reflective of the state of affairs in India,\" said Verniers. \"But they are able to get away with it more.\"Thousands of people gather to mark protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act law in Delhi, India, on January 26, 2020. Acting with impunityThe reason extremist groups appear to be on the rise is clear, according to experts: they have impunity and support. India prohibits hate speech under several sections of its penal code, including a section which criminalizes \"deliberate and malicious acts\" intended to insult religious beliefs. According to lawyer Vrinda Grover, any group inciting violence is barred under Indian law. \"Police, states and the government are responsible to ensure (inciting violence) doesn't happen,\" she said. \"But the state, through its inaction, is actually permitting these groups to function, while endangering Muslims who are the targets.\" Pandey's rant and some of the other calls for violence were the \"worst form of hate speech,\" according to Verniers.  \"This is the first time I find myself using the term 'genocide' in Indian politics,\" he said, referring to the comments made at last month's conference. \"They have tacit support in the form of government silence.\"That's because Modi also has a Hindu nationalist agenda, experts say.Indian comedian Vir Das sparks explosive online debate with controversial tale of 'two Indias'Modi swept to power in India in 2014, promising economic reform and development for the country. But starting from his first term as Prime Minister, minority groups and analysts say they began to see a significant shift in India's ideology from a secular to a Hindu nationalist state.The BJP has its roots in Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right wing-Hindu group that counts Modi among its members. Many RSS members are adherents of the Hindutva ideology that the Hindu Mahasabha preach -- to make India the land of the Hindus. In 2018, India's current Home Minister Amit Shah said Muslim immigrants and asylum seekers from Bangladesh were \"termites\" and promised to rid the nation of them. The BJP's Yogi Adityanath, the chief minister of the north Indian state Uttar Pradesh, known for his anti-Muslim views, once compared Muslim Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan to Hafiz Saeed, the alleged planner of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, according to the Press Trust of India. Between 2015 and 2018, vigilante groups killed dozens of people -- many of whom were Muslims -- for allegedly consuming or killing cows, an animal considered sacred by Hindus, according to a report from Human Rights Watch. Modi publicly condemned some of the killings, but the violence continued, and in 2017, his government attempted to ban the sale and slaughter of cows --currently illegal in several Indian states -- nationwide. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi inauguratea the Kashi Vishwanath Dham Corridor, Varanasi, on December 13, 2021. Human Rights Watch said many of the alleged murders went unpunished in part due to delayed police investigations and \"rhetoric\" from ruling party politicians, which may have incited mob violence.In 2019, India's Parliament passed a bill that would give immigrants from three neighboring countries a pathway to citizenship -- except for Muslims. It led to extended protests and international condemnation.In December 2020, Uttar Pradesh enacted a controversial anti-conversion law, making it more difficult for interfaith couples to marry or for people to convert to Islam or Christianity. Other states, including Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, and Assam, introduced similar laws, leading to widespread harassment and, in some cases, arrests for interfaith couples, Christian priests and pastors.The chief minister of India's Uttar Pradesh state Yogi Adityanath addresses a public rally in Allahabad on December 26, 2021. All of this has only served to encourage extremist groups like the Hindu Mahasabha, say experts. Zakia Soman, a women's rights activist and co-founder of the Muslim group Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, said \"a failure of governance\" had given rise to more right-wing extremists. \"Our community is realizing that we have become second-class citizens in our own country,\" Soman said. \"Minority bashing and hate is becoming regular and normalized. As the intensity increases, the venom and violence in their language also increases.\" A 21-year-old Muslim student in Delhi, who chose to remain anonymous for fear of backlash from right-wing groups, said Muslims are filled with \"a sense of fear\" every time right-wing Hindu groups make hateful comments. \"It gives us a sense that we don't belong here,\" he said.The future of the Hindu-rightDespite police investigations and public outrage, legal action against those who spoke and were present at December's event have been slow.In a letter submitted to Modi on Friday and seen by CNN, students and faculty of the prestigious Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore and Ahmedabad said his silence \"emboldens\" hate, adding there is \"sense of fear\" among minority groups in India. Some experts agree the government's silence has only emboldened these groups further.  \"Hate speech precedes hate crimes,\" Grover, the lawyer, said. \"And we are witnessing a crescendo of hate crimes. These groups are rapidly spreading poison through society.\" A 2019 US intelligence report warned that parliamentary elections in India increase the possibility of communal violence if Modi's BJP \"stresses Hindu nationalist themes.\" It added that state leaders \"might view a Hindu-nationalist campaign as a signal to incite low-level violence to animate their supporters.\" The BJP -- which rarely gives statements on the issue -- says it does not discriminate against minorities, adding in a statement last March that it \"treats all its citizens with equality\" and \"laws are applied without discrimination.\" But analysts fear the BJP's divisive politics will could lead to increased violence against minority groups in the lead up to pivotal state elections this year. And reported episodes of violence against Muslims have already increased ahead of this year's state elections. In December, crowds of India's Hindu-right confronted Muslims praying on the streets in the city of Gurugram, just outside of Delhi. They prevented Muslims from praying, while shouting slogans and carrying banners in protest. \"It is an electoral strategy,\" said Verniers, the political scientist. \"Create religious tension, activate religious polarization and consolidate on the Hindu vote.\" Grover, the lawyer, said criminal laws are \"weaponized\" in India, adding anyone who challenges those in power \"face the wrath of the law.\" \"Muslim lives in India are demonized,\" she said. \"The Indian state is in serious crisis.\"   On January 1, Pandey held a live broadcast for her more than 1,500 Facebook followers. The subject was \"Religious Parliament,\" her post said.For the 21-year-old student, it is difficult to \"expect any sense of justice\" for Indian Muslims. He says even having a Muslim name is enough to make him feel unsafe. \"It is really scary to carry the Muslim identity in India today.\"",

        "content": "Kyiv, Ukraine (CNN)A Russian military strike hit an evacuation crossing point in a Kyiv suburb Sunday, killing a family with two children and several other civilians trying to flee the Russian invasion, according to the city's mayor, as civilian casualties seeking safety from the onslaught continue to rise. Two mortar or artillery shells hit the checkpoint in the suburb of Irpin, northwest of Kyiv, Ukrainian authorities said, which has been the site of intense shelling by the Russian military in recent days. Irpin Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn said eight civilians have been killed across the district, and international media filming at the checkpoint reported that a shell landed as a stream of civilians was coming through. Blinken says US has seen reports of Russian abuses in Ukraine that 'would constitute a war crime'\"A family died,\" Markushyn said in a statement. \"In front of my eyes, two small children and two adults died.\"Video from the moment the strike killed a family shows a Ukrainian soldier standing outside a building on a street. Suddenly, an explosion is seen and heard on the video. Debris is heard raining down on the building and the street is obscured by a dust cloud. A number of journalists are heard reacting to the strike.Read MoreAs the scene begins clearing, someone is seen pulling the Ukrainian soldier away. Other soldiers run across the street and appear to be checking the condition of a number of individuals on the ground.\"Medic,\" someone is heard repeatedly screaming.Photographs from the Associated Press showed bodies on the ground covered by sheets, with suitcases standing upright nearby. CNN has determined the civilians were killed in the Russian military strike seen in the video.Russia invades UkraineThe Kyiv Regional Military Administration appealed to international organizations for help in resolving a growing humanitarian crisis.\"Thousands of people found themselves in isolation, because of direct hostilities, and in some places for 5-6 days they survive without electricity, water, food, medical help and means of subsistence. They are in direct danger,\" it said.The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said Sunday that more than 360 civilians had been killed in Ukraine since Russia's invasion began, while acknowledging that the real figure is likely \"considerably higher.\" CNN cannot independently verify the casualty numbers. The UN also reports more than 1.5 million refugees have fled Ukraine since February 24. Evacuation corridors closed In the country's southeast, hopes that a second attempt to open up safe evacuation routes for civilians in Mariupol and Volnovakha might succeed -- after a first effort failed on Saturday -- were dashed within hours.The governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said on Facebook on Sunday that the planned \"evacuation convoy with local residents was never able to leave Mariupol today: the Russians began to regroup their forces and heavy shelling of the city. It is extremely dangerous to evacuate people in such conditions.\"\n\nKyrylenko added that a convoy carrying humanitarian aid from the central city of Zaporizhzhia, three hours from Mariupol, \"has not yet reached its destination and is currently on its way.\"The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) also said Sunday's planned evacuation in Mariupol had failed.\"Today, our team began opening up the evacuation route from Mariupol before hostilities resumed. We remain in Mariupol and are ready to help facilitate further attempts -- if the parties reach an agreement, which is for them alone to implement and respect,\" the ICRC said on Twitter.\"People in Mariupol and in other places across #Ukraine are living in desperate situations. They must be protected at all times. They are not a target. People urgently need water, food, shelter. The basics of life. We need safety guarantees to be able to bring them aid.\"Ukrainian lawmaker Inna Sovsun claimed Sunday that Russian forces had damaged a gas pipeline in southeastern Ukraine, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without heat in bitter temperatures. 'They shoot at anyone who tries to leave.' Ukrainians describe terror of living under Russian occupation \"Donetsk-Mariupol gas pipeline was damaged by #Russian occupants. Now, more than 750,000 of people are left without any heat, while it's still often below 0\u00b0C (32 degrees Fahrenheit) outside,\" Sovsun said on Twitter. Separately, television and radio broadcasts have been knocked out in Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv, after Russian military strikes, according to the Regional Administration.In a post on Facebook Sunday, the Regional Administration said \"repeated shelling\" of the TV tower in Kharkiv had knocked out broadcasting capabilities. Russia has fired a total of 600 missiles since the invasion of Ukraine began, a senior US defense official told CNN on Sunday, and has committed approximately 95% of its amassed combat power inside Ukraine.Earlier Sunday, heavy shelling was reported to the west and northwest of Kyiv. The impact of explosions was heard by CNN teams in Kyiv and in rural areas to the southwest.

        "content": "(CNN)Storm Eunice tore down rooftops and trees, crushed cars and sent planes skidding on London's runways as millions of people across the United Kingdom hunkered down at home to stay out of hurricane-strength winds.The storm led to 10 fatalities across the UK and parts of western Europe, with wind speeds as high as 122 miles per hour (mph) -- the fastest on record in the country. High wind speeds is what make wind storms intense. The UK Met Office expanded its rare \"danger-to-life\" weather alert ahead of the storm on Friday morning to include most of the south of England and some of Wales.A woman was killed in north London's Muswell Hill on Friday after a tree fell on her car, according to a statement from the London Fire Brigade, while a man in his 50s was also killed on Friday while driving his car in Liverpool, according to Merseyside Police. In Hampshire, one man died and another was seriously injured in a car accident. Both men, in their 20s, were in their vehicle when a tree fell on top of it during the storm. Police are investigating the exact circumstances of the incident and have appealed for witnesses.Read MoreIn Ireland, which is also experiencing strong winds from Eunice, a man in his late 60s was killed after being hit by a falling tree, the national police service, known as the Garda\u00ed, confirmed to CNN.The man, who has not been named, died in County Wexford, southeastern Ireland, and was pronounced dead at the scene.The storm also wreaked havoc in mainland Europe, with German broadcaster ZDF reporting two deaths in Germany, with one person falling from his roof and the other crashing his car into a fallen tree. A 79-year-old English man also died in western Belgium after strong winds knocked him off his barge and into the water of a marina, state broadcaster RTBF reported.Meanwhile, the Amsterdam-Amstelland fire brigade reported three deaths due to fallen trees in the Netherlands on Friday, while most of the country was under the highest weather alert with people advised to stay home ahead of the storm. Large sections of the O2 Arena rooftop were blown off on Friday.The storm has damaged buildings in the UK, with footage shared to social media showing the roof of London's O2 arena severely damaged by strong wind.Op de #vrijheidslaan in Amsterdam is een boom op een fietser terecht gekomen. Deze fietser is hierdoor overleden.Large sections of the fabric roof were shredded and ripped off by the gusts, while the building was evacuated and closed.On its website, the 02 said an event at the venue Friday night would be rescheduled.\"The safety of our visitors remains of paramount importance, and we will continue to assess the ongoing situation and act accordingly,\" the statement said.Elsewhere, a CNN reporter witnessed part of a rooftop flying off a home in the southwestern London area of Surbiton. The roof crushed a car parked on the street. Social media video showed a building housing lifeboats with part of its rooftop blown off at Sennen beach in the country of Cornwall, where strong winds were pushing waves above a seawall. Police in Cornwall and neighboring Devon said they had received high volumes of calls about flying debris, collapsed roofs and fallen trees.Other video footage shared on Twitter showed a church spire in Somerset collapsing in high winds.Residents around the UK also posted images on social media of collapsed fences and trees in roads.A large tree fell after high winds battered an area of Battersea, London on Friday.Many homes were also left without power on Friday, including small pockets of London and larger areas of southern England.As dozens of flights were canceled across London's major airports, more than 200,000 people tuned in to watch a live stream on YouTube of planes landing at London's Heathrow. The aircraft were seen battling strong gusts as they came into land, some of them wobbling mid-air, others skidding from side to side once they hit the runway.The video, on the Big Jet TV channel, was accompanied by comical commentary by presenter Jerry Dyer, who kept viewers entertained by offering words of encouragement to the pilots, at one point saying: \"Come on mate, you can do it!\"British Airways said it was grounding a number of planes and expected \"significant disruption,\" but that most flights would go ahead as planned. \"Safety is our number one priority, and we're canceling a number of flights,\" British Airways said in a statement.The airline said it was looking at deploying larger aircraft where possible to better withstand the weather.Rail companies have urged customers to reconsider their plans, with blanket speed restrictions in place for most lines across the country. In a statement Friday, Network Rail warned of high winds blowing trees and other debris onto railway lines, which then block trains and cause delays and cancelations. Waves crash against the sea wall and Porthcawl Lighthouse in Bridgend, Wales, as Storm Eunice hits the UK on Friday. A local butcher carries his shop sign across a snowy pavement in  County Durham, Britain, as Storm Eunice makes landfall.Authorities are expecting gusts to cause travel delays, power cuts and possible mobile phone coverage outages throughout Friday.A sting jet could hitMeteorologists have also raised the possibility of a sting jet, the weather phenomenon which made the 1987 Great Storm so destructive and deadly. Eighteen people were killed in that storm and 15 million trees were blown down in winds that topped 100 mph.A sting jet is a very narrow and concentrated blast of powerful, upper-level winds that can form inside powerful weather systems. It descends to the the Earth's surface and can last a few hours, potentially causing damage to life and property, according to CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam. \"The 'sting' refers to the cloud formation it creates, which resembles a scorpion's stinger,\" he said.  A person walks past a sign at Waterloo station, warning of severe weather. Motorists drive through the sleet and snow along the M8 motorway near Bathgate in West Lothian as Storm Eunice sweeps across the UK after hitting the south coast earlier on Friday.Eunice is the second storm in a week for the UK after Storm Dudley battered parts of Scotland, northern England and Northern Ireland Wednesday, leaving thousands of homes without power. Those homes have since been reconnected. Hannah Cloke, professor of Hydrology at Britain's University of Reading, urged people to stay home where possible.She said people should not to take the red alert \"lightly,\" as the winds were likely to uproot trees and roof tiles. \"If you're hit by one of those you will be seriously hurt or killed. Wind that strong will sweep people and vehicles off streets, and topple electricity lines,\" she said. A climate connection?There is little to suggest any link between human-made climate change and the frequency and intensity -- or windspeeds -- of storms in northern Europe at current levels of global warming.But damage from windstorms are still getting worse because the rainfall associated with them is becoming more intense, a trend that many scientific studies do link to climate change. Sea level rise also plays a role.  \"With more intense rainfall and higher sea levels as human-caused climate change continues to heat the planet, flooding from coastal storm surges and prolonged deluges will worse still further when these rare, explosive storms hit us in a warmer world,\" Richard Allan, a climate scientists at the University of Reading, said in a statement. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that if global temperatures rise by 2 degrees Celsius, compared with levels before industrialization, then northern Europe would start to see an increase in the frequency of severe windstorms.Temperature rise is currently at around 1.1 degrees Celsius, according to conservative estimates. The world is on track for warming well above 2C, according to an analysis, which looked at governments' plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions at the COP26 climate talks last year.CNN's Martin Goillandeau, Nada Bashir, Sara Mazloumsaki, Manveena Suri and Jeevan Ravindran contributed to this report.",

        "content": "New York (CNN Business)Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are the latest cryptocurrency phenomenon to go mainstream. And after Christie's auction house sold the first-ever NFT artwork \u2014 a collage of images by digital artist Beeple for a whopping $69.3 million \u2014 NFTs have suddenly captured the world's attention.So what are NFTs?In the simplest terms, NFTs transform digital works of art and other collectibles into one-of-a-kind, verifiable assets that are easy to trade on the blockchain.Although that may be far from simple for the uninitiated to understand, the payoff has been huge for many artists, musicians, influencers and the like, with investors spending top dollar to own NFT versions of digital images. For example, Jack Dorsey's first tweet sold for $2.9 million, a video clip of a LeBron James slam dunk sold for over $200,000 and a decade-old \"Nyan Cat\" GIF went for $600,000. A CryptoKittyBut NFTs aren't exactly new. CryptoKitties, a digital trading game on the cryptocurrency platform Ethereum, was one of the original NFTs, allowing people to purchase and sell virtual cats that were both unique and stored on the blockchain. Read MoreSo why is the NFT phenomenon taking off now?  \"Some of that interest is from people who enjoy supporting the work of independent creators by purchasing their works,\" Artsy CEO Mike Steib told CNN Business. \"Others are intrigued by the idea of taking a digital asset that anyone can copy and claiming ownership of it. The recent headline price records for NFTs seem to have been largely driven by newly minted crypto millionaires and billionaires looking to diversify their bitcoin holdings and more interest to the crypto ecosystem.\"Here's what else you need to know: What are NFTs?Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are pieces of digital content linked to the blockchain, the digital database underpinning cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum. Unlike NFTs, those assets are fungible, meaning they can be replaced or exchanged with another identical one of the same value, much like a dollar bill. Move over, bitcoin. Ether is back and nipping at your heelsNFTs, on the other hand, are unique and not mutually interchangeable, which means no two NFTs are the same. Think of Pok\u00e9mon cards, rare coins or a limited-edition pair of Jordans: NFTs create scarcity among otherwise infinitely available assets \u2014 and there's even a certificate of authenticity to prove it. NFTs are typically used to buy and sell digital artwork and can take the form of GIFs, tweets, virtual trading cards, images of physical objects, video game skins, virtual real estate and more. How to buy NFTsEssentially, any digital image can be purchased as an NFT. But there are a few things to consider when buying one, especially if you're a newbie. You'll need to decide what marketplace to buy from, what type of digital wallet is required to store it and what kind of cryptocurrency you'll need to complete the sale. OpenSea's marketplaceSome of the most common NFT marketplaces include OpenSea, Mintable, Nifty Gateway and Rarible. There are also niche marketplaces for more specific types of NFTs, too, such as NBA Top Shot for basketball video highlights or Valuables for auctioning tweets such as Dorsey's currently up for bid. A beginner's guide to crypto lingoBut be wary of fees. Some marketplaces charge a \"gas\" fee, which is the energy required to complete the transaction on the blockchain. Other fees can include the costs for converting dollars into ethereum (the currency most commonly used to buy NFTs) and closing expenses. If you're curious and want to know more about what it's like to purchase an NFT, we went ahead and bought one. (And yes, it is a cat.) How to sell NFTs?NFTs are also sold on marketplaces and the process can vary from platform to platform. You'll essentially upload your content to a marketplace then follow the instructions to turn it into an NFT. You'll be able to include specifics such as a description of the work and suggested pricing. Most NFTs are purchased using ethereum but can also be bought with other ERC-20 tokens such as WAX and Flow. How to make an NFT? Anyone can create an NFT. All that's needed is a digital wallet, a small purchase of ethereum and a connection to an NFT marketplace where you'll be able to upload and turn the content into an NFT or crypto art.

        "content": "(CNN Business)Facebook is changing its company name as it shifts its focus to the \"metaverse\" and confronts wide-ranging scrutiny of the real-world harms from its various platforms after a whistleblower leaked hundreds of internal documents.Founder Mark Zuckerberg said Thursday that Facebook will change its corporate name to Meta, effectively demoting Facebook's namesake service to being just one of the company's subsidiaries, alongside Instagram and WhatsApp, rather than the overarching brand.The company formerly known as Facebook also said in a press release that it plans to begin trading under the stock ticker \"MVRS\" on December 1.A rebranding could be part of an effort to overhaul Facebook's reputation and turn the page following a series of PR nightmares, including misinformation on its platforms, content moderation failures and revelations about the negative effect its products have on some users' mental health.The name change, which was announced by Zuckerberg during the company's virtual reality and augmented reality conference Facebook Connect, aligns with its growing focus on the metaverse, which refers to efforts to combine virtual and augmented reality technologies in a new online realm. Read MoreWhy Silicon Valley is betting on making this dystopian sci-fi idea a reality\"I've been thinking a lot about our identity as we begin this next chapter. Facebook is one of the most used products in the history of the world,\" Zuckerberg said on Thursday. \"It is an iconic social media brand, but increasingly it just doesn't encompass everything that we do.\"Today we're seen as a social media company,\" he added, \"but in our DNA, we are a company that builds technology to connect people. And the metaverse is the next frontier just like social networking was when we got started.\"Zuckerberg, who said he loved studying classics in school, said the name was inspired by the Greek word meta, which means \"beyond.\" \"For me, it symbolizes that there is always more to build.\"The company also replaced its corporate sign, which featured a picture of a \"thumbs up,\" outside of its California, headquarters with one touting its new logo: a blue infinity sign.Earlier this week, the company said that it would break out Facebook Reality Labs \u2014 its division dedicated to augmented and virtual reality services \u2014 as a separate reporting segment from its social apps. The change is set to take effect beginning in the fourth quarter.Facebook did not announce any executive changes on Thursday. But on Zuckerberg's personal Facebook page, his job title was changed to: \"Founder and CEO at Meta.\" When asked by The Verge if he would remain CEO at Facebook in the next 5 years, he said: \"Probably. I don't have a specific date how long I want to be doing this for. I guess what I could say is I'm very excited about the next chapter of what we're doing.\"Mark Zuckerberg's avatar presenting the metaverse at an event Thursday.Zuckerberg kicked off the big product event by teasing a series of new social, gaming and workplace concepts for the metaverse -- and by acknowledging the optics of focusing on such products amid renewed scrutiny of the company.\"I know that some people will say that this isn't a time to focus on the future, and I want to acknowledge that there are important issues to work on in the present. There always will be,\" Zuckerberg said. \"So for many people, I'm just not sure there ever will be a good time to focus on the future.

Mvuemba released the latest collection for her fashion brand, Hanifa, on Instagram live on Friday. During the show, the digital models sashayed down the runway with the designer's outfits draped on headless, three-dimensional bodies. The Pink Label Congo collection featured pants and dresses in vibrant colors and was described as the future of runway fashion by spectators.          View this post on Instagram           We can't say thank you enough for all of your support. The full #PinkLabelCongo\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde9 collection is now available on Hanifa.co | Watch the replay on our IGTV\u2728. A post shared by  Hanifa (@hanifaofficial) on May 24, 2020 at 9:55am PDT\nMvuemba, whose previous designs have been worn by celebrities such as rapper Cardi B, told Teen Vogue, she already had plans to go digital with her collection before various Covid-19 restrictions were put in place around the world. She said in the interview with the fashion magazine that she had been working for seven months to create the computer-generated models, \"Designing content using 3D models and now an entire collection has been a complete game changer for me. \"It actually requires an even greater amount of attention-to-detail for the clothes to fit and look just right.\" Read MoreHanifa's virtual collection is part of a growing trend of fashion houses increasingly embracing technology to showcase their designs. Last year American fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger used an Instagram influencer Noonoouri created by a graphic designer to promote their products.Hilfiger's CEO said at the time, \"they shape consumers' purchasing decisions, inspiring them in more relevant ways, further blurring the lines between digital and reality.\" A tribute to African seamstressesMvuemba said during the launch that each of the outfits represents Congo, the central African country where she is from. One of the outfits was a backless mini dress in red, blue, and yellow, representing the flag of Congo. And a maxi dress in blue and green representing the point where the Congo river meets land.  Congo is one of the world's leading producers of cobalt, accounting for more than 60% of the world's production. Cobalt is a chemical element used in producing smartphones, tablets and electric vehicles. Anifa Mvuemba of Hanifa at the Teen Vogue Celebrates Generation Next\"I am so intentional about everything I do with this collection,\" she said. \"If you're African then you know about African seamstresses and how detail is so important and the color is so important and prints are so important. I really just wanted to use that in this collection, just to give tribute to African seamstresses,\" Mvuemba said during the launch on her Instagram page on Friday. Congolese cobalt minesThe Pink Label Congo collection is not just about fashion going digital. It's also about raising awareness for Congolese mines, the designer said. Inspired by her hometown in Congo, 29-year-old Mvuemba started the fashion show with a short documentary on the experiences of children working in cobalt mines. Apple, Google, Microsoft, Dell and Tesla are sued over alleged child labor in CongoUnderaged children and women work in these mines under harsh conditions including physical abuse. Sometimes they are forced to dig for cobalt with nothing but their bare hands.In 2019, Tech giants like Apple, Google, Dell, and Tesla were sued for their alleged involvement in using children to mine cobalt in the country. Raising awareness on minesMvuemba said the Pink Label Congo collection was inspired by these mine stories and she is using it to bring awareness around it.\"Growing up, I heard so many stories about the cobalt and mining issues in Congo...a lot of times, there are children at these mines, a lot of them are losing their lives and a lot of families are affected,\" she said. The documentary showcased multiple reports from media organizations about the current mining conditions in Congo and the dangers of including children in the process.          View this post on Instagram           Riddled with a painful history, the beauty of Congo is often untapped and overlooked. The gentleness, beauty, history, poise, majesty, strength, power, and hope of the Congolese spirit inspired this collection. When creating each piece, I was reminded of the stories my mother told me of the women she knew back home in Congo. Women who suffered great loss but still, mustered every ounce of strength everyday to show up. My hope is that this collection inspires all women to stand tall in their power and like the Democratic Republic of Congo, to use their history, whether pretty or painful \u2014 to redesign their future. My country, the land of Congo, is ripe with an abundance of natural resources \u2014 the greatest of which are its people \u2014 its women.  Hanifa presents.... Pink Label Congo.  Now available at Hanifa.co A post shared by  Hanifa (@hanifaofficial) on May 22, 2020 at 9:39pm PDT\nEverything about the collection is related to Congo to serve as a reminder of these mine conditions, Mvuemba said. \"I really wanted to shed light on their conditions. And I want this collection to support and benefit the families that are affected,\" she added.",

        "content": "Hong Kong (CNN)As the sun rose on the morning of June 4, 1989, the Chinese people woke to a country which had changed overnight.For seven weeks it had seemed like China was on the brink of a massive social change, but in just one night the dreams of hundreds of thousands of protesting students and workers were brutally crushed.For about a decade, China's economy had been steadily opening up and allowing small amounts of free enterprise in the Communist country, after years of strict state control under chairman Mao Zedong.Directing the change was then-Paramount Leader Deng Xiaoping, who wanted to see China grow prosperous by embracing some pro-market liberalization. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese gather on June 2, 1989 in Tiananmen Square demanding democracy despite martial law in Beijing.But when large-scale protests in Beijing called for greater social freedoms, such as freedom of speech and even democracy, Deng would prove far less enthusiastic.Read MoreThe protests first began in April, triggered by the death of former Chinese Communist Party leader Hu Yaobang at the age of 73. Seen by the public as a champion for liberalization, Hu had been deposed two years earlier and his death on April 15 was widely mourned.Three days later, thousands of grieving students marched through Beijing, calling for a more democratic government in Hu's honor.Chinese students hold aloft a banner calling for freedom, democracy and enlightenment on the Martyrs Monument in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, festooned with a giant portrait of Hu Yaobang, April 19, 1989.The protesters occupied Tiananmen Square, the massive public space in the center of Beijing which faces onto the Forbidden City, former home of the Chinese emperors, and the Great Hall of the People.Over the coming month and a half, the numbers of protesting students and workers steadily grew. A rally on May 19 in the square drew an estimated 1.2 million people, leading then-Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang to meet with them to plead for an end to the protests.He began his now-famous speech by saying: \"Students, we came too late. We are sorry.\"A Chinese student leader reads a list of demands to students staging a sit-in in front of Beijing's Great Hall of the People on April 18.But he was ignored and hardline Premier Li Peng imposed martial law on the city the same day. Trucks of soldiers began to arrive in Beijing, but still the protests didn't stop.On May 30, in the center of the square, protesters built a 10-meter high statue called the Goddess of Democracy, to boost morale among the huge crowd.More than seven thousand students from local colleges and universities march to Tiananmen Square, Beijing, May 4, to demonstrate for government reform.In the end, the government moved swiftly. After a tense two weeks, on the night of June 3, convoys of armed troops entered Beijing with an aim to clear the square by whatever means necessary.Blocked by civilians in the streets who were attempting to protect the students, the troops opened fire. Students, workers and other ordinary citizens fought back, setting fire to some military vehicles, but they were overwhelmed.Pro-democracy demonstrators surround a truck filled of People's Liberation Army (PLO) soldiers on 20 May 1989 in Beijing on their way to Tiananmen Square.Witnesses told horrific stories of tanks driving over unarmed protesters and soldiers shooting indiscriminately into crowds.No official death toll was ever released by the Chinese government, but human rights groups estimate it was the hundreds, if not thousands.On June 4, a rickshaw driver pedals wounded people, with the help of bystanders, to a nearby hospital in Beijing after they were injured during clashes with Chinese soldiers in Tiananmen Square.Many of the protest leaders were imprisoned, some of whom wouldn't be released for more than a decade, and the government has worked hard to remove all mention of the massacre from Chinese history and media, seeing it as a threat to the legitimacy of its continued one-party rule.So far, at least, it appears to have worked. On the 30th anniversary in 2019, no public memorials or events marking the day are expected in mainland China.CNN's Mohammed Elshamy contributed to this article.",

        "content": "Editor's note: CNN will be launching the Meanwhile in China newsletter on June 21, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country's rise and how it impacts the world. Sign up here.Friday marks the 32nd anniversary of the Chinese government's brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in and around central Beijing in the early hours of June 4, 1989. For an event that happened almost 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) away, the Tiananmen Square massacre has become deeply embedded in Hong Kong's psyche. That's because for the past three decades, Hong Kong was the only place where major commemorations were held, including marches, church services, and huge candlelit vigils in the city's Victoria Park. After Hong Kong became part of China in 1997, the continuation of these events was always seen as a major litmus test for the city's ongoing autonomy and democratic freedoms, supposedly guaranteed until 2047 by its de facto constitution, the Basic Law, under the principle of \"one country, two systems.\"The 30th anniversary in 2019 saw one of the biggest turnouts at the Victoria Park vigil, with organizers claiming some 180,000 people joined the commemoration (though police said it was closer to 40,000). That anniversary came amid escalating tensions over a proposed extradition bill between Hong Kong and China: just five days later, over a million people  marched against it, and in the months that followed, the city was consumed by increasingly violent protests and police crackdowns. Read MoreIn the wake of those protests, Beijing introduced a national security law for Hong Kong, bypassing the city's semi-democratic legislature to criminalize secession, subversion and collusion with foreign powers. That law has been used to crack down on a host of political activity, and almost every prominent pro-democracy politician and activist is either in prison -- or headed there. Thousands took part in a vigil for Tiananmen in 2020, despite the event being banned on coronavirus grounds. As talk of the law rumbled ahead of its abrupt passing on June 30 last year, many saw June 4, 2020, as potentially the final opportunity for a major commemoration. Despite authorities banning the Victoria Park vigil on pandemic grounds, tens of thousands still turned out to mark the event peacefully, and police took a hands-off approach -- though subsequently arrested and charged a number of activists deemed to have \"organized\" the protest. This year, the gloves are off. The city's Security Bureau said Saturday that any rally on June 4 would be deemed an unauthorized assembly, and \"no one should take part in it, or advertise or publicize it, or else he or she may violate the law.\"Offenders could face up to five years in prison, while those promoting the event could be jailed for up to 12 months, the bureau added. Already this week one activist -- known locally as Grandma Wong -- was arrested for staging a solo Tiananmen protest, while the city's recently reopened June 4 Museum was forced to shut again. Organizers of the candlelit vigil have canceled the event for the first time in over 30 years, asking instead that people \"mourn June 4 with perseverance and wisdom, under lawful, safe, peaceful and rational circumstances, in their own way, at the right time and place,\" though that didn't stop one of them being detained in the early hours of Friday. Likely the safest way to remember Tiananmen will be behind closed doors -- similar to how the event is marked in mainland China, by the few who still choose to remember.

India's monsoon season has begun, and the amount of rainfall looks to be normal, after several years of unusual weather patterns during an annual period critical for the country to stave off drought and other issues. A smoldering container ship is sinking off the Sri Lankan coast, heightening fears an oil and chemical spill could exacerbate one of the worst ecological disasters in the country's history.Meanwhile in China, all ultra-marathons and trail-running events have been suspended indefinitely in the wake of a mountain race that saw 21 runners die in extreme weather last month.Business of ChinaIf China needed a sign Washington's hostility to Beijing wasn't going to thaw under Joe Biden, this is it.On Thursday, President Biden expanded a Trump-era ban on American investment in dozens of Chinese firms that Washington believes are linked to China's military. Under the executive order, Americans are prohibited from owning or trading securities tied to 59 companies, citing the threat of Chinese surveillance technology. The original order, signed by President Donald Trump in November, applied to 31 Chinese companies that the administration said \"enable the development and modernization\" of China's military and \"directly threaten\" US security.Biden's new order goes into effect on August 2.Tech giants including smartphone maker Huawei and Hikvision, a major manufacturer and suppliers of video surveillance equipment, remain on the list, as do some of China's biggest telecommunications firms, including China Mobile, China Telecommunications and China Unicom.Asked Thursday in Beijing about the expected Biden announcement -- the move was reported earlier by Bloomberg -- China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Washington's actions marked a \"total disregard of facts\" and \"hurt the interests of global investors including those in the US.\"Several of the companies that have been named in both orders have previously dismissed claims that they were tied to the Chinese military as groundless.The move suggests that Washington isn't rushing to make amends with Beijing. Analysts have previously said that while Biden will likely strike a more predictable and diplomatic tone with China than Trump did, they don't expect the administration to ease up on tech and trade policy.Even so, the countries are restarting talks on some issues. Beijing said Thursday it is now having \"normal communication\" with Washington on trade and the economy, citing recent discussions between Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai,  and US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen as \"professional, frank and constructive.\"-- By Jill Disis and Kyle BlaineChina will stay shut until 2022China has delivered over 700 million coronavirus vaccine doses, but may not relax border restrictions until next year at the earliest, a top health official said Thursday. Life in China has been relatively normal for months now, and vaccinations are roaring along -- some 40% of the population is now inoculated against Covid-19 and it shouldn't be long until China reaches herd immunity level. However, because of the success of the country in containing the virus, there is very little of it floating around to test whether its vaccines will stop transmission as well as deaths -- unlike in the United States, where authorities know the vaccines are working because infection numbers are dropping, along with serious cases.This leaves China with some \"unique difficulties\" when it comes to reopening, said Feng Zijian, the deputy director General of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, according to Bloomberg. \"I don't think we've got to that point -- if we try to open even when 60% or 80% of population are vaccinated, it could still lead to a severe outbreak,\" Feng said Thursday at a conference in the eastern city of Qingdao, the news outlet reported. \"It largely depends on the technical considerations, societal consensus and political concerns.\"This curse of success has become something of a pattern across Asia, with territories that excelled in the early response to the pandemic -- Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia -- now struggling with vaccines, while some places in the West race ahead. Part of the problem is that when there is little risk of catching Covid, people are less willing to get vaccinated, which makes authorities more wary about opening up. After a rocky start, China has had one of the best responses to the pandemic globally, but that could come to haunt the country if officials are nervous to test that success by op.

Hundreds of people were killed on June 4, 1989, as People's Liberation Army troops cracked down on pro-democracy protesters in and around Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Events will be held and speeches made to commemorate the massacre and those who died in cities around the world. Tiananmen Square massacre: How Beijing turned on its own peopleIn central Taipei, capital of self-ruled Taiwan, a massive inflatable version of the iconic \"Tank Man,\" who defied the military as they entered Tiananmen Square, has been on display for several weeks. On Monday, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council called on Beijing to \"face up to historical mistakes and apologize as soon as possible for the crackdown.\"\"In the past 30 years, Beijing lacked the courage to calmly reflect on the historical significance of the June 4th Incident,\" the council's statement said. \"Rather, they blocked the information and distorted the truth about it and tried to conceal the crime.\"An artwork of Tank Man by Taiwanese artist Shake, inspired by a sketch of dissident Chinese artist Baidiucao, is on display in front of Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in Taipei on May 21, 2019.Read MoreActivists will hold a rally in Washington on Tuesday, with representatives of dozens of human rights groups, including Amnesty International, expected to attend, as well as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement Monday that the massacre still stirred the conscience \"of freedom-loving people around the world.\"\"We salute the heroes of the Chinese people who bravely stood up 30 years ago in Tiananmen Square to demand their rights,\" he said, urging the Chinese government to make a \"full, public accounting\" of the incident. Thousands of people hold candles during a candlelight vigil on June 4, 2016 in Hong Kong, Hong Kong.The biggest event will take place in Hong Kong, the only place on Chinese soil where mass commemorations are held. A candlelit vigil has been held in Victoria Park every year since 1990, with hundreds of thousands attending during key anniversaries. But across the border, the Chinese authorities will be watching attentively for any attempts to remember the massacre.  Tourists were visiting Tiananmen Square as usual on Tuesday, under the close watch of police and subject to frequent security checks. On Monday, Chinese state-run newspaper Global Times said the massacre had been a \"vaccination\" against future \"political turmoil\" in the country, trumpeting China's economic progress in the decades since.It wasn't the first Chinese comment on the anniversary. Speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on Sunday, Defense Minister Wei Fenghe said crushing the protests had been the \"correct policy.\"Visitors gather around the Monument to the People's Heroes on Tiananmen Square during the 30th anniversary of a bloody crackdown of pro-democracy protesters in Beijing on Tuesday, June 4, 2019.A day that changed ChinaFor weeks in 1989, hundreds of thousands of students and workers gathered in Tiananmen Square, in the heart of the Chinese capital, to call for greater democracy as well as political and social reforms. They faced down the tanks in Tiananmen Square. Now they want their children to forget itAt the height of the protests it seemed like they could be successful, forcing a government that was already pursuing economic reform to also accept limited political liberalization. But hardliners won an internal battle within the ruling Communist Party and a crackdown was ordered. That decision changed China forever, ending hopes of a gradual move towards democracy. Today the Communist Party is stronger than ever, with President Xi Jinping recently throwing out term limits and clearing his way to serve for life. Beijing has always defended the crackdown. Speaking at an international event Sunday, Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe described the Tiananmen protests as \"political turmoil that the central government needed to quell.\"\"The government was decisive in stopping the turbulence, that was the correct policy,\" he said.JUST WATCHED2019: China's year of sensitive anniversariesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH2019: China's year of sensitive anniversaries 03:53The events of June 4 have been wiped from the history books in China and any discussion of the crackdown is strictly censored and controlled. Tiananmen is a prime target of the Great Firewall, China's sprawling online censorship apparatus. Tuesday will be a major test of that system, which activists have spent years attempting to get past by using coded phrases such as \"May 35\" or \"that year.\" But it's a test that it will likely pass with ease. It's that time of the year again.

June 4 has been nicknamed \"internet maintenance day\" for the number of websites that go offline around the anniversary, their owners deciding that being dark is safer than accidentally publishing something which could provoke the ire of the authorities. On Tuesday, CNN's website was blocked by the Great Firewall. While the move is not unprecedented, CNN was available to users in China ahead of the June 4 anniversary, as confirmed by GreatFire.org, an independent site which analyzes internet censorship in China.The Cyberspace Administration of China, the government body which oversees internet regulation, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

        "content": "Hong Kong (CNN Business)One year was all it took for a Beijing-imposed National Security Law to take down Hong Kong's largest and loudest pro-democracy newspaper.Next Media announced Wednesday that Apple Daily, its flagship tabloid, would publish its final copy Thursday due to an untenable environment in which its journalists had been arrested and millions of dollars in assets had been frozen. Its digital platform will cease operations on the same day, the company said in a statement. The news sent a deep chill through Hong Kong's media industry and undermined government claims the new legislation would not diminish press freedom. Last year, China's ruling Communist Party moved to bring Hong Kong in line with its authoritarian rule by bypassing the city's legislature to implement the security law. It punishes anything the authorities deem to be subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison. While city leader Carrie Lam said back then that press freedoms would still be protected, Apple Daily staffers say they knew it was only a matter of time before they were targeted.Read MoreHong Kong's first trial under new national security law begins without a jury\"But it still came as a shock when it happened,\" said one journalist at the publication, who asked to remain anonymous out of security fears. Since the law took effect, Apple Daily has been crippled bit by bit. Founder Jimmy Lai \u2014 already in jail for attending a pro-democracy rally \u2014 has been arrested and charged with colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security. Five of the newspaper's top editors and executives have been accused of the same crime, apparently for using articles to call for foreign governments to sanction Hong Kong.  Hundreds of police officers have twice raided the publication's newsroom, most recently seizing computers and materials \u2014 an alarming development for journalists and their sources in an increasingly sensitive environment. Several Apple Daily journalists had already quit before this month, saying the rewards of their work no longer outweighed the risk of imprisonment.  Even as official pressure piled on the newspaper, public support surged. Last Friday, after the arrest of its top editors, Apple Daily printed 500,000 copies which sold out.Police officers raid  the Apple Daily office on June 17 in Hong Kong.That wasn't enough to counter a financial squeeze brought on by Hong Kong authorities. While Next Media told investors it had enough money to last 18 months from April, in recent days the paper's bank accounts had been frozen.  On Wednesday, as the board met to discuss the paper's future, police officers again descended on the newsroom arresting another journalist. Hours later, the paper announced that after 26 years on newsstands, it would close its doors.\"A woman sent me a note a few days ago saying without Apple Daily she just doesn't feel as safe as she used to with a free press as the protector of society,\" said Mark Simon, one of Lai's top advisers. \"They're coming for everyone else soon.\"A critical voiceJimmy Lai founded Apple Daily in 1995, channeling the wealth he'd accumulated as a textile tycoon into the Next Digital publishing operation. The mission of its centerpiece title, Apple Daily, was always clear: to criticize the Communist Party that Lai had fled mainland China from as a child.The newspaper was a sensation, and its tabloid sensibilities quickly made it a market leader, giving Lai a huge platform to influence opinion in Hong Kong. The paper drove a paparazzi culture in the city, and at times attracted ire for its reporting methods. But it also tracked the wealth of mainland officials and their families in Hong Kong, and devoted ample resources to holding those in power to account.         An advertisement introducing the newspaper to the world made it clear Jimmy Lai knew the Apple Daily made him a target. Beijing's growing economic influence in the early 2000s meant that other outlets often avoided openly criticizing the Communist Party, mindful of commercial implications. Lai didn't care. Apple Daily continued poking the bear, even if that meant major Hong Kong corporations such as Cathay Pacific or CK Hutchison Holdings never advertised with the publication.The newspaper didn't back down as the Communist Party under President Xi Jinping grew increasingly intolerant to any dissent \u2014 especially in its disputed or semi-autonomous territories such as Hong Kong, which after being handed back to China from Britain in 1997 was promised its own system of governance for 50 years. That two-track setup led to a disconnect between how Hong Kongers expected to be governed and Beijing's desire to control the city.  Lai was a key figure in a series of 2014 protests dubbed the Umbrella movement, which brought central Hong Kong to a standstill for months. His paper became a symbol of the opposition to Beijing's plans for how Hong Kong's leader would be selected.When mass unrest erupted again in 2019, this time over a bill proposing extradition to China, Apple Daily's front pages urged readers to attend huge marches, and printed anti-government posters for them to carry.Copies of the Apple Daily newspaper -- paid for by a collection of pro-democracy district councillors -- sit on a cart before being handed out in Hong Kong on August 11, 2020, a day after authorities conducted a search of the newspaper's headquarters after the companys founder Jimmy Lai was arrested under the new National Security Law.  Anger in the city that year turned into the most serious violence Hong Kong had seen in decades: The city's legislature was sacked, a dramatic 12-day siege unfolded at a university and the international airport was shut down, twice.  All that was too much for Beijing on Chinese soil. In June 2020, as pandemic restrictions thwarted the ability of Hong Kongers to protest, China passed the National Security Law.In the 12 months since, nearly all pro-democracy politicians have either been jailed or have fled the territory. Apple Daily was the last major voice of the pro-democracy camp still at large.Declining media freedomsApple Daily divided opinion in Hong Kong. It was loved by those who shared its liberal values and loathed by conservatives who accused it of causing chaos.Still, its death has caused alarm about freedom of press in Hong Kong. On Tuesday, city leader Lam tried to dismiss those fears, saying that the police probe into Apple Daily was \"unrelated to normal journalist work.\" Michael J. Abramowitz, president of NGO Freedom House railed against that sentiment. \"Treating independent, fact-based journalism as a threat to national security is an unacceptable attack on press freedom and comes amid a wider crackdown on freedom of expression and freedom of assembly in Hong Kong,\" he said.  It is now unclear how Hong Kong's mini-constitution \u2014 the Basic Law, which guarantees freedom of expression and the media \u2014 will operate alongside a national security law that sets increasingly narrower parameters for journalistic work.  The Apple Daily's closure follows a slew of attacks on press freedom. The city's police chief recently proposed an anti-fake news law; a journalist was convicted for an administrative error when investigating alleged police wrongdoing; and public broadcaster RTHK has seen its coverage squeezed.Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai, founder and owner of Apple Daily newspaper is seen handcuffed and escorted by the guards leaving Lai Chi Kok Reception Centre on December 12, 2020, in Hong Kong, China.  Two fugitive opium dealers, a media mogul and an alleged smoking gun video: the story of a Hong Kong newspaper feudAt the same time, there has been a clampdown on broader civil liberties. This year, Hong Kong's annual Tiananmen Square vigil was not permitted to go ahead, ostensibly because of Covid restrictions, and potential attendees threatened with up to 12 months in jail.In a sign of Hong Kong's decreasing tolerance for political positions that diverge from those of Beijing, Taiwan announced it will remove all non-local staff from its office in the city. Taipei accused the Hong Kong government of demanding its Taiwanese staff sign a document acknowledging Beijing's claim over the self-governing island as a prerequisite for visa renewals.  As newsstands open next week, they will be absent of the apple-bearing masthead that has been a staple for decades. Jimmy Lai remains in jail with no ability to advocate for the paper founded. In his mid-70s, it is debatable whether he will ever walk free in Hong Kong again. Just now, outside Apple Daily's HQ, a woman named Pan left a sunflower and card for staff at the paper. \"Although the Apple is about to be picked off the tree, the spirit and perseverance of Apple Daily people will forever stay in our hearts.\" pic.twitter.com/3EC16iWAD3\u2014 Karina Tsui \u5f90\u654f\u59ff (@karina_tsui) June 23, 2021 \"I never would have imagined it would come to this.\" said Andrea Lo, a freelance journalist in Hong Kong. \"Apple Daily is a huge part of everyday life for us as Hong Kongers, but not just because it has consistently been the biggest champion of the voice of the people. All of us find a lot of value in its coverage on everything from the pro-democracy protests, to real-time reports on incidents around Hong Kong.\"  On Wednesday, grieving readers gathered outside the newspaper's headquarters, holding placards, and bearing cards and flowers. \"I think people will miss the Apple Daily as a platform where they could speak freely and be critical of the government and Beijing,\" said the Apple Daily newsroom staffer. \"Maybe some other media will become the substitute for us,\" he added, doubtfully. -- Lauren Lau contributed to this report.",

Kind and confident, she was also the friend who talked about how excited she was to have children of her own. That's why it was such a devastating loss to her family, friends and to me, when she lost her battle with postpartum depression and died by suicide on July 24. Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in women with postpartum depression. Nima Bhakta (L) and author Sneha Kohli Mathur (R) became roommates and friends at the University of California San Diego.  In a letter to her family before she died, Nima wrote that she tried to tell her loved ones about her struggle with postpartum depression but she hadn't been able to find the words to explain the depth of her suffering. She wrote that she had a loving and supportive husband and that no one was at fault for her pain. Read MoreIt started, she wrote, after her son was born in 2019. She felt completely changed as an individual, wife, sister, daughter and aunt, and she didn't understand how she couldn't even attempt cooking or other things that she once enjoyed. Her constant worry about the future and self-blame for any difficulties with her son overwhelmed her. She got to the point that she believed that she was a complete failure as a mother and was scared that she would cause him harm in the future. Throughout her letter was a sense of shame for needing help taking care of her son, and guilt that she wasn't feeling better despite having an incredibly supportive husband, Deven Bhakta, and her sisters and family.FDA approves first postpartum depression drugIn her text messages to me she expressed she was experiencing postpartum depression. \"Everything I do for Keshav just seems like a task for me, it's been hard to have that bond between me and him.

Deven's been such a big help it's ridiculous.\" She couldn't see what a wonderful mother she was to her beautiful baby boy. I saw her as a devoted mother diligently attending to all of his daily needs. I could see she loved him so much. How did a mother who didn't have any of the risk factors for PPD -- factors that include a personal or family history of depression and lack of social support -- still succumb to it? It can be harder for Indian women like us to ask for psychological help because these issues are not always discussed in our community, but there are other reasons women suffer from this misunderstood condition. What is postpartum depression?During pregnancy and in the hours after childbirth, women experience a dramatic drop in their estrogen and progesterone hormone levels, and that fluctuation is thought to contribute to postpartum mental health problems, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.Nima and her husband Deven celebrated at their baby shower on October 6.In addition to the changes in hormones, emotional factors, fatigue and general life stressors may contribute to PPD, experts say. Postpartum depression may begin in the days or weeks following childbirth, or it may begin months later, and it can last weeks, months or years if untreated.  While the experience of PPD can look different for each woman, common symptoms include a loss of pleasure or interest in doing things she once enjoyed; eating and sleeping much more or much less than usual; experiencing panic attacks or anxiety most or all of the time; feelings of guilt, worthlessness and self-blame; sadness or crying uncontrollably; fear of not being a good mom; fear of being alone with the baby or disinterest in the baby; difficulty making decisions; and thoughts of hurting oneself or the baby. Postpartum depression is not the so-called \"baby blues,\" which 70% to 80% of all moms experience, according to the American Pregnancy Association. While baby blues may begin soon after birth, its symptoms -- which can include crying for no apparent reason, anxiety, insomnia and mood changes -- should dissipate two weeks after childbirth. If they continue past two weeks, mothers should be examined for postpartum depression.How many women are affected by postpartum depression?Anywhere from 10% to 20% of new moms in America experience postpartum depression, which means that about 400,000 to 800,000 mothers are impacted annually, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Furthermore, studies have found that up to 50% of cases may go undiagnosed.Suicide is a leading cause of death in the United States during the postpartum period, accounting for about 20% of postpartum deaths, according to a 2005 study. Despite its prevalence, there is no universally designed or approved screening process, and the experience of going through PPD is often a surprise to new moms.How are women of color disproportionately affected? The experiences of women of color are not well documented in research, and this leads to a discrepancy of care for mothers of color, according to a 2016 survey by Robert Keefe, a professor at the University at Buffalo School of Social Work. Women of color may not reach out for mental health support because they believe that their depression is a normal part of motherhood.Women of color face further pressures due to cultural expectations. Furthermore, our mental distress may present in a different manner than a medical practitioner has been trained to look for, as the majority of research reflects the experiences of white women, according to Keefe's survey. This picture of Nima was taken on October 11 by her husband, Deven in Bishop, California.Asian and Asian American women often express psychological distress in physical symptoms, such as gastrointestinal problems, or headaches and backaches, according to a 2014 study by Dr. Sandeep Grover and Dr. Abhishek Ghosh, both psychiatrists with the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in India. This may be because psychological expression of distress is culturally frowned upon. In Keefe's survey, Latina women reported that having a medical provider of the same cultural background made them more comfortable to confide in, but there are fewer providers of color to serve them. One solution that would benefit women of all cultures is to create more support groups for mothers of the same cultural background. How can family members help new mothers? Despite having a supportive family and friends who encouraged her to seek out medical support, Nima still felt detached from everyone. In the midst of a pandemic, when people are more isolated than usual, it's important to check in on the new moms in your life. If you know someone who is a new mom, there are things you can do. Talk to your new mother friends and make the conversation about her, not just the baby. Don't try to solve her problems; instead, listen and validate her feelings. Celebrate all the little victories she achieves, both with her baby and personally. This is a medical condition, and people with this condition need medical assistance. If we break a leg, we wouldn't hesitate to visit a doctor, take medications to treat the pain and then go to therapy to strengthen the muscle, right? Taking care of our mental health is the same! Asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. What other help is available? Friends can't be therapists. However, we can normalize and encourage psychotherapy. While taking medication, usually antidepressants, is thought to help treat PPD, as a mental health professional, I find that therapy is also often needed but underutilized. Through therapy, a mom can better understand her experiences and discover healthy ways to cope with her feelings, solve problems, set realistic goals and respond to situations in a positive way. Despite its prevalence and potentially fatal outcome, only one drug has been developed to specifically treat postpartum depression. An intravenous infusion of the drug brexanolone, sold as Zulresso, was approved by the FDA in 2019. Can we share our feelings?I wish I had been more open with Nima about my own experience with having suicidal thoughts during my pregnancy. I spent most of my pregnancy in bed, in the dark, getting most food from a PICC line inserted into my arm because of hyperemesis gravidarum, a medical condition that affects 0.3 to 2.3% of pregnant women. Hyperemesis gravidarum is characterized as extreme and continuous vomiting and nausea during pregnancy. It can cause weight loss of more than 5% of the pregnant woman's body weight, lead to dehydration and potential complications for the baby.  Some days I felt like I simply couldn't go on. Other than my therapist, I did not share these thoughts with anyone. I wondered what was wrong with me and how I could be a good mother when I thought about ending my own life. We all have a lot to learn about postpartum depression.This short video is a good place to start: https://t.co/rbnSlKM7Fl#breakthestigma4nima pic.twitter.com/qCoaOAisV0\u2014 Anand Patel (@anandp29) August 3, 2020 But I was not myself. I was experiencing perinatal depression. As my therapist explained to me, depression is a powerful force that hijacks your brain and doesn't allow you to think clearly. I didn't want any visitors. I didn't even want to talk to or text anyone. I wanted to lie in the dark without so much as the curtains being open. Sometimes I just lay on the bathroom floor waiting for my next bout of vomiting because I didn't have the energy or motivation to make it back to my bed. Luckily, I have an educational background in psychology, and I recognized the signs of slipping into a depression. I reached out to my therapist, and therapy and medication helped me get through that difficult time, and continue to help me manage my anxiety.Parents need to know they're not aloneI hope that sharing my experience from three years ago will encourage more people to share their experiences, because only then will we shatter the stigma. That way others experiencing similar things know that they are not alone.I am so thankful that I could reach out to my therapist during those difficult times, and that my family encouraged and supported my journey. If you are having or ever have had any mental health struggles, especially related to PPD, and are open to sharing, please do so. It may save someone's life. Also, give therapy a chance; it will be worth it.

In response to this hashtag, friends and strangers have been sharing stories about their own struggles related to PPD, including some who had never openly discussed their experiences before. Ultimately, this is what inspired me to share my story as well.To get help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). There is also a crisis text line.

        "content": "(CNN)As the world battles historic droughts, landscape-altering wildfires and deadly floods, a landmark report from global scientists says the window is rapidly closing to cut our reliance on fossil fuels and avoid catastrophic changes that would transform life as we know it.The state-of-the-science report from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says the world has rapidly warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial levels, and is now careening toward 1.5 degrees \u2014 a critical threshold that world leaders agreed warming should remain below to avoid worsening impacts.Only by making deep cuts to greenhouse gas emissions, while also removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, can we halt the precipitous trend.\"Bottom line is that we have zero years left to avoid dangerous climate change, because it's here,\" Michael E. Mann, a lead author of the IPCC's 2001 report, told CNN.Unlike previous assessments, Monday's report concludes it is \"unequivocal\" that humans have caused the climate crisis and confirms that  \"widespread and rapid changes\" have already occurred, some of them irreversibly.Scientists can now say yes, that wild weather was caused by climate change.\nRead MoreThat is due in part to the breakneck pace at which the planet has been recently warming, faster than scientists have previously observed. Since 2018, when the panel published a special report on the significance of 1.5-degrees, greenhouse gas emissions have continued mostly unabated and have pushed global temperatures higher.Even under the IPCC's most optimistic scenario, in which the world's emissions begin to drop sharply today and are reduced to net zero by 2050, global temperature will still peak above the 1.5-degree threshold before falling.In a statement, UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres called the report \"a code red for humanity,\" and noted the 1.5-degree threshold is \"perilously close.\"\"The only way to prevent exceeding this threshold is by urgently stepping up our efforts, and pursuing the most ambitious path,\" Guterres said.\n\nThe IPCC report comes just three months before the UN-led international climate change talks, during which global leaders are expected to strengthen their commitments to cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Though some countries have pledged stricter cuts since the 2015 Paris Agreement, many have missed deadlines to do so, and there is still a significant gap between what leaders are promising and what's needed by 2030.\"From a scientific perspective, every degree, every part of a degree, every half of a degree matters in terms of limiting the impacts that we will see from climate change,\" Ko Barrett, the former vice chair of the IPCC, told CNN. \"So at whatever level countries decide is what they're aiming for, there are benefits and there are consequences to choosing those limits.\"An evolution on climate changeWith each IPCC report, the science has converged on what scientists now say is irrefutable: the climate crisis is caused by human greenhouse gas emissions.1990 \u2014 \"The unequivocal detection of the enhanced greenhouse effect ... is not likely for a decade or more.\"1995 \u2014 The ability to connect climate change to human influence is \"currently limited.\"2001 \u2014 There is \"new and stronger evidence\" that warming is due to greenhouse gas emissions.2007 \u2014 Global warming is unequivocal, and there is \"high confidence\" that human influence is to blame.2013 \u2014 \"Warming of the\u00a0climate\u00a0system is unequivocal,\" and \"human influence on the\u00a0climate\u00a0system is clear.\"2021 \u2014 \"It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land.\"Dave Reay, the director of the Edinburgh Climate Change Institute, said world leaders \"must have the findings of this report seared into their minds\" at the November conference and take urgent action.\"This is not just another scientific report,\" Reay said. \"This is hell and highwater writ large.\"As computing power increases, scientists are more confident than ever in connecting the dots between the climate crisis and extreme weather, which for some regions \u2014 even at 1.1 degrees of warming \u2014 is already becoming unbearable.Michael Byrne, a climate researcher at the University of Oxford, said that's what's different about this report is \"the effects of global warming are no longer in the distant future or in far-flung corners of the world.\"\"We knew what was coming and now it's here,\" Byrne said.A heat wave that killed hundreds this summer in the US Northwest and British Columbia would have been \"virtually impossible\" without the climate crisis, researchers found. It made Hurricane Harvey's devastating rainfall roughly three times more likely to occur and 15% more intense, scientists said. Harvey dumped more than 19 trillion gallons of water on Texas and Louisiana in 2017, triggering devastating floods in the Houston area. The IPCC says heavy rainfall that used to occur once every 10 years now occurs 30% more frequently. JUST WATCHEDNearly 200 people were killed in Germany and Belgium when more than an entire month's worth of rain fell in as little as 12 hours. Tens of thousands of people were unable to return to their homes left without access to power and drinking water.ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNearly 200 people were killed in Germany and Belgium when more than an entire month's worth of rain fell in as little as 12 hours. Tens of thousands of people were unable to return to their homes left without access to power and drinking water. 01:21Globally, droughts that may have occurred only once every 10 years or so now happen 70% more frequently, according to the report. The climate change connection is particularly strong in the Western United States, which is experiencing a historic, multiyear drought that has drained reservoirs and triggered water shortages.Amid unrelenting drought and record heat, wildfire seasons are now longer and result in more destructive fires. Six of the top 10 largest fires in California have occurred in 2020 or 2021, according to CalFire.\"We're seeing truly frightening fire behavior. I don't know how to overstate that,\" said Chris Carlton, supervisor of California's Plumas National Forest supervisor in California, who called this year's wildfire season \"uncharted territory.\"Charles Koven, a lead author of the report's chapter on global carbon cycles, said California has already reached a tipping point on wildfires.\"I don't think we knew where that threshold was until we crossed it,\" he told CNN. \"What the report makes clear is that the likelihood of crossing any of these tipping points is certainly going to increase the more warming that we see.\" Photos: Wildfires raging in the WestThe Alisal Fire burns near Goleta, California, on Tuesday, October 12.Hide Caption 1 of 84 Photos: Wildfires raging in the WestA firefighter puts out a roadside fire in Goleta, California, on Wednesday, October 13.Hide Caption 2 of 84 Photos: Wildfires raging in the WestAn air tanker drops retardant on a wildfire in Goleta.

Even limiting warming to 1.5 degrees, which countries in the Paris Agreement determined was ideal to stave off the worst impacts, the kinds of extreme weather the world has experienced this summer will become more severe and more frequent.Beyond 1.5 degrees, scientists say the climate system could begin to look unrecognizable.Andrew Watson, a scientist at the University of Exeter, said the climate models used in the report don't capture the risk of \"low probability, high impact\" events that become more likely as global temperature increases.\"These are events such as ice sheet collapse, sudden changes in ocean circulation, or catastrophic wildfires,\" Watson said. \"These 'known unknowns' are scarier still.\"Key takeaways from the UN report on the climate crisisThe roughly 3,500-page report is a culmination of nearly a decade of climate research by scientists around the world. And although the IPCC is considered the ultimate source on climate change, it tends to be conservative in its findings because of the way it's developed \u2014 by having hundreds of scientists come to a consensus not only on the research but the language describing it.Yet Monday's report uses the strongest wording to date in describing the climate crisis. Ice sheets are melting and will continue to melt; extreme flooding from higher sea level will continue to get more frequent; and sea level itself will continue to rise well into the 22nd century, simply because of the amount of heat the oceans have already trapped. At the same time scientists are sounding the alarm, the International Energy Agency says human carbon emissions \"are on course to surge by 1.5 billion tonnes in 2021 \u2014 the second-largest increase in history \u2014 reversing most of last year's decline caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.\"The IPCC report is clear that global leaders must cut greenhouse gas emissions now, before deadly and costly weather extremes get even worse. But Barrett said a key message in the report is that it's still possible to prevent the most dire impacts.\"It really requires unprecedented transformational change, rapid and immediate reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050,\" said Barrett. \"The idea that there is still a pathway forward is a point that should give us some hope.\"CNN's Angela Dewan, Brandon Miller and John Keefe contributed to this report.",

Photograph taken by fellow astronaut James McDivitt.\"A picture like that still has enormous power today,\" the photography expert said.There's also an extremely rare picture taken by Aldrin showing his fellow explorer Armstrong on the lunar surface. Most of the photos from the Apollo 11 landing were taken by Armstrong himself, so there are very few of him actually on the Moon.\"It is very rare to find a vintage print of that because it wasn't recognized by NASA at the time,\" explained the Bloomsbury Auctions spokesman. \"They didn't realize it was Neil Armstrong, so they didn't release it to the press. It was found years later, and very few people have seen it, it hasn't been widely published, so that one is of obvious historic significance.\"But the collection is not limited to photos from the 1960s heyday of the space program. The oldest image in the sale is one dating all the way back to 1946; shot by a camera strapped to a V-2 rocket, it is the first to show the earth from space.The view of the first 'Earthrise' over the lunar horizon changed Man's relationship with the cosmos foreverSara Wheeler, Bloomsbury AuctionsIn addition to photos of astronauts, there are also landmark mosaics and panoramas showing the lunar surface, and shots looking back at Earth from the darkness of space, including the iconic \"Earthrise\" image taken by Apollo 8's William Anders in December 1968, which Sara Wheeler, head of photographs at Bloomsbury Auctions, said \"changed man's relationship with the cosmos forever.\"The auction house spokesman said previous sales of NASA images had proved hugely popular, both with space enthusiasts and photography aficionados.\"Four years ago in 2011 we sold a private collection of NASA photos and I was surprised by the range of people who did buy them -- I'd say about half were interested in the aesthetics of the image, and the other half were looking for the significant moments in space history -- the classic images: the first 'earthrise', the first picture of the whole earth and so on.\"He said the fact that the pictures were vintage prints, dating back to the days of the space race only added to their allure.\"They represent a golden age in the history of photography, when a few men went to the unknown to bring back awe-inspiring pictures,\" said Wheeler.The From the Earth to the Moon: Vintage NASA photographs sale takes place at Bloomsbury Auctions in London on Thursday February 26.",

These makeshift shelters for the city's homeless are now an almost permanent fixture of the city's landscape, with barbecue grills and clusters of bikes standing alongside them.Some residents have tethered their tents to nearby fences and industrial buildings. Others run long power cords from their tents to nearby light poles to tap into the city's power grid. A few Skid Row pet owners have created small dog yards next to their tents under tarps to block out the sun and makeshift fencing. On a recent evening in this industrial part of LA's downtown, a young woman was washing her hair and her tank top in the jet of water gushing from a fire hydrant into the street.  As Los Angeles city and county officials struggle to shelter and build housing for nearly 60,000 people who are living on the streets, they are facing resistance -- not just to new structures in neighborhoods where residents fear more crime and blight, but also from some within the homeless community, who insist they would rather continue living independently on the streets in their tents.While the homeless crisis is perhaps most visible in California, it is gripping so many other cities, including Washington, that many of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates are beginning to face questions from voters about their plans. In 2018, about half of all Americans experiencing homelessness lived in one of five states -- California (24%), New York (17%), Florida (6%), Texas (5%) or Washington state (4%), according to the 2018 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, presented to Congress in December. In dozens of interviews with unsheltered people in LA over the past year, many told CNN they won't apply for housing because they are afraid of the police, or unable to access the right documents to apply for ID, or sometimes simply wary of losing their independence if they are forced to live under rules that might be imposed if they moved into subsidized housing facilities.Read MoreIN PICTURES: L.A.'s homelessness crisisTents are now all over LA County. But the so-called \"shelter-resistant\" population is most evident in Skid Row, the portion of downtown where many of the city's homeless shelters, temporary housing and homeless services have traditionally been concentrated.    At the root of this tremendously complex problem is the fact that many within LA's unsheltered population are grappling with substance abuse addictions and untreated mental illness. Another major factor is that a series of lawsuits against the city -- aimed at preserving the rights of homeless people to protect their property -- has created a semipermanent tent culture in some sectors of LA.Under city policy, tent-dwellers are required to take down their tents during daylight hours to clear the streets for pedestrians and business owners. But because of the lawsuits, that policy is not being uniformly enforced. In some areas it does not appear to be enforced at all.The lawsuits and court injunctions against the city have had other unintended consequences. Because of the proliferation of tents, police say, it is much harder to identify and halt drug dealing and human trafficking. The legal battles have also complicated the city's ability to clear trash-strewn streets, because it is not easy to identify what bedding or clothing might belong to an unsheltered person living nearby.Homeless women most vulnerableThe way in which tent culture feeds resistance to housing is one of the greatest frustrations for Los Angeles Police Officer Deon Joseph, who has worked in Skid Row for more than two decades both as a homeless advocate and enforcer. During several nighttime patrols through Skid Row, he reeled off countless stories of unsheltered women who he has tried to get into the pipeline for housing, in part because they are among the most vulnerable to sexual assault, domestic violence and even demands for money from gang members who try to charge rent on certain blocks.Several times a year, Joseph holds what he calls \"Ladies Night\" for the women of Skid Row -- a workshop where he brings in advocates to teach self-defense, how to report assault and rape, and legal rights.He often cites the example of a 70-year-old woman named Lena living in Skid Row who he got to know well but who was resistant to housing: \"I tried to house her, tried to house her, tried to house her,\" Joseph said, \"and then one day I came back and someone found her dead in a pile of garbage. A human being found in garbage.\"Joseph notes that scores of well-meaning volunteers and church groups show up on Skid Row each month to try to help the population by providing food, clothing and even new tents. But in Joseph's view, that assistance often perpetuates the cycle of people living on the street. \"The shelters and the missions here, they give food and clothes to draw people in to get the services to that help people get on their feet -- like drug programs, alcohol programs, domestic violence program, job programs,\" Joseph said. \"But many of the folks from here won't use them, because they're getting their needs met on the streets of Skid Row.\"Rising homeless rateAs a result of several ballot measures approved by LA voters in the past few years, the city and the county spent hundreds of millions of dollars last year to address the homeless crisis. But the number of people living without shelter still went up 12% in the county and 16% in the city. Homelessness among youth and children rose 24% over the previous year, according to the 2019 Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count Results. Of the nearly 60,000 people who are homeless in LA County, 19% told officials they came to LA County from out of state, 15% said they arrived from another part of California and 1.2% said they came from outside the United States. While the homeless count in Los Angeles was shocking, the rise in homelessness in neighboring counties was equally bracing. Homelessness was up 43% in Orange County over the previous year, 28% in Ventura County and 50% in Kern County.When questioned about why they had fallen into homelessness, 53% of those who said they were homeless for the first time in LA County cited \"economic hardship\"-- with the lack of affordable housing serving as a major driver for many. The staggering homeless count rose despite the fact that LA's coordinated city-county homeless crisis response system helped 21,631 people move into permanent housing last year.Another 31,500 people have been assessed by case managers and are waiting for housing or rental subsidies, according to city and county homeless officials. The county has opened eight new mental health urgent care centers and a sobering center to expand its outreach.Housing for the homelessWhile Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has confronted serious opposition in some neighborhoods even for his initial goal of placing 15 new shelters in City Council districts across the city, residents of some parts of Los Angeles County have been more receptive to housing for the homeless.One example is the former Tiki Motel in LA County, a notorious site of neighborhood crime and blight that appeared in the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie \"The Terminator.\"Al Nunez, who grew up in East Los Angeles and was homeless for three years after his mother died of lung cancer, is one of the residents who now live at the converted Tiki Apartments.Nunez was paralyzed by a gunshot wound to the spine 16 years ago. He often got sick during the time he was homeless, and would go days, he said, sleeping in his wheelchair.\"They would call me 'the statue,' \" he recalled in an interview. \"I was just alone because I was ashamed and embarrassed. Especially, where I was at -- it was my neighborhood where I grew up.\"Former friends and acquaintances would often pass him on the street: \"They wouldn't even acknowledge me or say anything to me. But I understand, it's because it's a stigma like -- 'You're homeless' -- It's like I wasn't the same person.\"\"All I could think about is that I was going to either die from getting sick -- from being in my wheelchair -- or to the point where I wanted to take my own life because it was just a lot of suffering,\" he said. \"The only time I would go lay on a bed was when I would end up in the hospital. But ... once I was stable, it was like, 'You've got to go back on the street and fend for yourself.' \"At another housing development called Mosaic Gardens at Willowbrook, in an unincorporated area of LA County, formerly homeless residents or those who were housed here because they were on the brink of homelessness have a playground, a computer lab and financial literacy programs, as well as access to services to help treat substance abuse or mental illness. Suny Lay Chang, the chief operating officer of LINC Housing Corp., which built the project, notes that they involved the community in the design, from the paint colors to the city-in-the-country feel that they tried to create with a community garden and kitchen.\"We have groups come in to lead cooking classes and demonstration classes to help people learn how to eat healthy, cook healthy. We'll use some of the vegetables from the community garden to do that,\" Chang said. \"It's part of treating the whole individual.\"The project got off the ground, in part, because the community got behind it. One of the community leaders involved was Michael Torrence, a minister at nearby Fellowship Baptist Church who also directs a substance abuse prevention program for youth and families that is part of Volunteers of America of Greater Los Angeles.Torrence said residents from the Willowbrook community were there \"from the planning to the first shovel to the cutting of the ribbons.\"\"We feel a great sense of ownership,\" he said during an interview in the community kitchen of Mosaic Gardens at Willowbrook. \"I'm not a resident here, but as far as I'm concerned this is my place too.\"When asked about the resistance in other parts of Los Angeles to building homeless housing units and shelters, Torrence said he would argue that those neighborhoods will be safer if currently unsheltered people have ready access to wraparound services for substance abuse and mental health issues.\"Not in my backyard is only because you have a backyard right now,\" Torrence said. \"We have to recognize the fact that these are people.\"\"If we address this, and provide housing and assistance and support -- then you can get past the whole notion of this is the other -- and begin to see them as my neighbor,\" he said.\"So, your backyard? If they're invested in it, they will take care of the backyard.\"A national political issueWhen Los Angeles County released its shocking homeless count this month, Sen. Kamala Harris tweeted that housing is a \"human right,\" noting that her proposed LIFT Act -- to give lower-income working families a tax credit of up to $6,000 a year -- as well as her \"Rent Relief Act\" are intended to address the crisis.The California Democrat and presidential candidate, addressing the Poor People's Campaign Forum in Washington on Monday, also introduced a new line in her campaign speech, saying, \"What we learn in that parable is that neighbor is that person you are walking by who is homeless on the street.\"Julian Castro recently toured storm tunnels beneath the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 in Las Vegas where hundreds of homeless individuals have sought shelter -- and on Monday he outlined his plan to \"end chronic homelessness by the end of 2028.\" \"It wasn't lost on me or anyone else there that underneath hotels that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars,\" Castro said, \"you have people who are living in deep poverty, sleeping not even in the street but in a drainage tunnel.\"California voters approached both Joe Biden and Beto O'Rourke citing homelessness as a top concern during their respective visits to the Golden State. A voter in San Diego -- a city that erected enormous tent shelters last year to temporarily house hundreds of people -- told O'Rourke she was worried about the number of veterans living on the streets. The former Texas congressman noted that some of the homeless veterans he has spoken to in his home state had to wait so long for mental health treatment that they sought drugs on the street to treat their symptoms. \"If you cannot see a doctor and be well enough -- then there's a more likely chance that you're going to be homeless in the first place,\" O'Rourke told the voter during his San Diego town hall in late April. \"So starting with health care for everybody -- without exception, including mental health care -- is so fundamental to being able to get this done. And in California, perhaps especially, where housing prices are going through the roof, we've got to make sure that we are creating enough housing units for the demand that is here.\" Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont routinely highlights the growing number of homeless people nationwide as he rails against the fact that 40 million people are living in poverty while the \"very rich\" are \"getting richer.\" \"Tonight some 500,000 Americans, including many veterans, will be sleeping out on the streets,\" Sanders said during a speech earlier this month at George Washington University.",

        "content": "Hong Kong (CNN Business)Detroit finally has its first unicorn: a hip, very millennial sneaker trading platform that wants to create a so-called \"stock market of things.\" StockX, an online marketplace for rare kicks including Jordans and Yeezys, allows users to track shoe collections like asset portfolios and brands to hold \"IPOs\" for new products.In June, the startup hit a new milestone, notching a billion-dollar valuation after raising the largest round of venture capital funding in Michigan history, according to data provider PitchBook. Now the company is sharing more on its strategy to ride the booming sneaker craze and its effort to eliminate retail pricing, not just for limited-edition items. StockX's website looks more like trading platform Fidelity than it does Adidas. If you click on a pair of cream white Yeezys, you'll see how much its sale price has fluctuated over the last 12 months, a \"ticker,\" a 52-week high and a gauge for price volatility. Read More\"Demand has always been a guess, a forecast, an estimate, a projection off of last year \u2014 except in the stock market,\" Josh Luber, StockX's co-founder and former CEO told CNN Business in a recent interview in Hong Kong. Luber currently serves on the leadership team and board of directors.\"If you're buying a share of Nike stock on the New York Stock Exchange, there's one ticker symbol for Nike and there's one price for Nike ... It is standardized. And that is literally the rule for us, is to take a consumer good and make it functional in a stock market.\"The site, which started off in footwear and went live in 2016, has resonated with sneaker fans. It has expanded rapidly over the years, branched out into new categories, racked up hundreds of thousands of sellers and gained customers in nearly 200 countries.Resetting retailThe idea was first born about nine years ago, when Luber, a former IBM consultant who'd been collecting shoes since he was eight, found a way to track auction data for sneakers on eBay. He decided to turn it into a price guide called Campless, \"a play off the fact that people camp out for shoes,\" he said. \"No more \u2014 camp less.\" \"I have a pretty reasonable collection in the sneaker world,\" says StockX co-founder Josh Luber. \"It's around 400 pairs.\"In hopes of monetizing the project, Luber requested meetings with \"everybody,\" he said. \"Nike, eBay, Foot Locker, Complex, you name it.\"Nothing stuck until 2015, when a representative for Dan Gilbert, the billionaire founder of mortgage lender Quicken Loans and owner of the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers, got wind of the concept \u2014 and reached out. Luber couldn't believe his luck. \"There was maybe one guy in the whole world who had this exact same idea at the exact same time, and it happens to be one of the most successful business people in the world,\" he said. They agreed to team up.The sneaker businessStockX makes money through transaction fees, and sees millions of dollars in activity on its platform each day, according to a spokesperson. As of June, the most recent month for which the company made its figures available, revenue had doubled over the past year \u2014 and a representative said it's projecting similar growth this year.Experts chalk up the company's ascent to two trends: The rise of streetwear culture, which has exploded around the world, and the need for a trusted resale outlet with modern-day conveniences.Sneakers and streetwear are \"very hot now,\" said Sucharita Kodali, an e-commerce and retail analyst at Forrester. As much as 85% of growth in the global luxury goods market in 2017 came from millennials and younger consumers, which has led more brands to embrace streetwear, according to a Bain report. At the same time, some customers said they were getting tired of buying sneakers on eBay or on random Facebook groups, where there was constant worry about getting duped.\"The resale platforms give buyers and sellers a secure and convenient way to trade sneakers,\" said Matt Powell, a sports business analyst at the NPD Group. \"Prior to the platforms, sales were much more complicated and risky.\"A StockX employee processing a pair of sneakers. The company started with six employees and has since grown to a headcount of 800.StockX isn't the only player in this space. GOAT Group, another sneaker resale startup based in Los Angeles, is a major competitor and won a $100 million investment from Foot Locker earlier this year.To alleviate concerns, both companies enlist armies of people to sift through and authenticate the shoes and other designer goods sold on their platforms. That has helped them win trust with customers.\"Fakes are becoming better and better by the day,\" said Billy Woodward, a StockX user who has collected about 250 pairs of sneakers and is based in San Antonio, Texas. \"The authentication process is a big deal for me.\"The practice could catch on with traditional retailers, too. One day, Nike (NKE) and Adidas (ADDDF) will likely also get in the game of verifying used merchandise, predicts Kodali. \"They can capture the profit from the secondary market, or they can choose to destroy or save the shoes that come back to them to increase the value of what continues to be in circulation,\" she explained. \"Frankly, I'm surprised it hasn't happened yet.\"Trading sneakers like stocksSome customers say the platform has made them rethink how they view consumer goods. \"I absolutely believe that StockX has changed the game,\" said Woodward, who uses the company's app to check the latest price fluctuations on shoes he's coveting. \"I will use them to see if a sneaker that I don't necessarily want to own for my personal collection is going to generate a profit for me and how much that profit could be.\"A pair of shoes listed on StockX.Others are more skeptical.\"I generally don't believe in and am not interested in treating the sneakers I've bought and collected purely as an investment,\" said Brendan Dunne, a deputy editor at Complex and co-host of \"Full Size Run,\" a weekly online sneaker talk show. Dunne owns about 700 pairs of sneakers, dozens of which he has bought and sold on StockX. \"To turn them into a number would be to strip them of their true value, which is sentimental,\" he added.'IPO' for shoesStockX doesn't plan to stop there. Someday, users will also be able to exchange goods without ever taking possession of them, said Luber. \"You can literally have day trading. This is like oil futures.\"One of the startup's most important plans for growth also happens to rest on perhaps its loftiest idea: getting retailers to treat its platform as a full-fledged distribution channel. That means putting out new products through a process called a \"blind Dutch auction,\" which lets users bid what they want while setting a winning price based on the amount of merchandise available.\"We literally talk about it as IPOing products into existence,\" said Luber.StockX employees examining shoes at a company facility. The startup is based in Detroit, where it recently raised the largest round of venture capital funding ever seen in Michigan.The company tested out the concept in January, hosting an \"initial public offering\" for a pair of slides designed by Ben Baller, a celebrity jeweler.Customers showed up: Over three days, more than 10,000 bids were placed on 800 pairs of shoes, and users who made the highest offers won, according to StockX. But because of the way the auction was set up, they all paid the same amount.The way the company sees it, it's a win-win. \"If the [goods] were released in stores, you might have seen campouts and crowd control issues. If released online, sites would've crashed or bots would've gotten them all,\" it said in a blog post. \"We think this [is] a fundamentally better way to release and price hyped products.\"Going globalWorking with brands is just one of three ways that StockX hopes to grow over the next year. The team of 800 has ambitious expansion plans that are bankrolled by a roster of high-profile investors, including Silicon Valley heavyweights GGV Capital, GV (formerly known as Google Ventures) and Marc Benioff. Even celebrities such as Eminem, Steve Aoki, Karlie Kloss and Mark Wahlberg have jumped onboard. Battle of Supremes: How 'legal fakes' are challenging a $1B brandA big part of the pitch to investors has been international growth, which Luber described as the company's \"highest priority.\"\"In the US, we started to see that, 'Hey, street culture is becoming a lot more vibrant.' And streetwear captured that,\" said Hans Tung, a managing partner at GGV Capital and StockX board member.\"In China, we noticed the same thing ... And when you see that happening in the two biggest markets in the world, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that other parts of the world are following as well, and be like, 'We gotta be in this market.\"A StockX worker authenticating a Louis Vuitton handbag in Detroit. Verifying designer merchandise has helped the company build trust with users, who often worry about getting duped online.About a quarter of StockX's business comes from outside the United States, particularly from countries such as China and Japan. The company declined to share specific projection numbers, but said it aims to become a household name over the next three years by adding more teams overseas and rolling out its service in different languages. The company also plans to capitalize on its existing user base with the addition of more products, such as watches, handbags and collectibles.Although StockX's core approach is unique for retail, Luber said it's a tried-and-true tactic; one \"we didn't make up.\"\"The stock market has been the most efficient form of commerce for 200 years,\" Luber said. \"All we did was copy that, and point it from old commodities, like stocks and bonds and oil and gas, to new commodities, like streetwear and watches and handbags.\"",

        "content": "Story highlightsPaul McCartney honors Ringo Starr at Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony Green Day, Lou Reed, Joan Jett & the Blackhearts also honored (Billboard)The key to rock's longevity is it never defines itself into irrelevance. So while there were some loud, dirty guitars at the 2015 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in Cleveland on Saturday night, there was as much recognition for rock's antecedents in soul and blues, speaking less to a particular taxonomy than a spirit that's beyond words.It's easy to talk of such spirit when Paul McCartney is there to honor Ringo Starr, and Yoko Ono is on hand as well. Speaking briefly backstage, Ono expressed feeling that it was wonderful for Starr to be honored, \"just sad John and George aren't here,\" referring to her late husband John Lennon and Beatles guitarist and fellow songwriter George Harrison.Starr was certainly happy to be there \u2014 after a long wait, he's the final Beatle to be inducted as a solo act. \"I've finally been invited, and I love it,\" said the 74-year-old drummer. \"I got lucky, and it was actually in Cleveland,\" he said to enormous applause.Fifty-one years earlier, Starr had been in town to play the very same Hall; he admitted backstage that he didn't remember the cops stopping the show during \"All My Loving\" and making the Beatles return to the dressing room for ten minutes until the fans could be calmed. Starr said in a backstage interview that he couldn't recall the incident specifically, but admitted that there had been a lot of shows in between.Read More\"I'll remember this one,\" he promised.Others receiving Rock Hall honors included Paul Butterfield Blues Band, early soul act The 5 Royales, singer Bill Withers, punk rockers Green Day, Lou Reed, Joan Jett & the Blackhearts and Stevie Ray Vaughan.It was a night for the young to honor the old and perhaps prepare for a later visit. John Mayer hailed his longtime idol, the late Vaughan, in a heartfelt speech. John Legend came out to honor Bill Withers with a performance of \"Use Me\" backed by Stevie Wonder, who inducted Withers. The two then shared \"Lean on Me,\" until Legend went and pulled Withers to the front of the stage to join them.Beck, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Bill Withers, Seymour Stein hit Rock Hall's weekend festivitiesThe 76-year old soul legend hasn't performed live in many years but had hinted in the months leading up to the induction ceremonies that he might sing once more. Withers sounded great, though he may have an even brighter future in stand-up.\"This has got to be the biggest AA meeting [in the] Western hemisphere,\" said Withers, alluding to an earlier moment in the show when Jimmie Vaughan confessed, \"I taught my brother guitar, and he taught me how to get sober.\"He called being inducted by Wonder, \"A lion holding the door for a kitty cat.\"JUST WATCHEDSinger Bill Withers: Hall of Fame induction was 'fun'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSinger Bill Withers: Hall of Fame induction was 'fun' 02:58The moment of relative levity was welcome after moving tributes paid to the late Lou Reed by Patti Smith and Reed's widow, music artist Laurie Anderson, who shared the three rules for life that they came up with: \"One: don't be afraid of anyone; Two: get a really good b------t detector and learn how to use it; Three: be really, really tender.\"Smith had to push back tears on at least three occasions. She recalled a night when they wound up in the same hotel and Reed invited her up. She found him in the tub dressed in black and she sat on the toilet and talked with him.Green Day was inducted by Fall Out Boy, who referenced the length of some of the speeches. Cracked Fall Out Boy frontman Patrick Stump: \"I feel like I'm in a line at the DMV.\" As one of the youngest acts, it's not surprising they gave one of the two most exciting performances of the evening.Rock Hall induction ceremony: Lou Reed 'would be amused,' says sisterThe other belonged to Tom Morello, Doyle Bramhall II and Zac Brown with harmonica player Jason Ricci performing \"Born in Chicago\" in tribute to the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. Not only did Ricci slay, but Morello played a nasty scabrous solo that raised the hairs on your arm, it was so alive.Miley Cyrus inducted Joan Jett in her own inimitable way, recalling a time she walked in on Jett smoking pot and being so turned on by her strength, wisdom and soul that the young pop star wanted to have sex with the legendary rocker. Jett joined the Blackhearts and Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl for a mini-set that include such classics as \"Bad Reputation,\" the Runaways' \"Cherry Bomb\" and \"Crimson and Clover,\" the Tommy James & the Shondelles cover that Jett took to No. 1. It was that kind of a night, and it closed with a rousing version of the Beatles' \"I Want to Be Your Man,\" where just about everybody who could make it out on stage did, including a near-end guitar scrum/lead-off between Gary Clark Jr., Morello, Zac Brown and Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Nick Zinner.\u00a92015 Billboard.

        "content": "(CNN)Saturday is the anniversary of what many consider to be the greatest achievement of the 20th century.It's been 50 years since astronaut Neil Armstrong became the first man to step on the surface of the moon. Buzz Aldrin followed him out of the Eagle lander while Michael Collins orbited the moon in the Columbia spacecraft. Celebrations commemorating that day are planned across the country Saturday.Whether you saw the landing as it happened on Sunday, July 20, 1969, or recently watched rare or never-before-seen footage in the documentary, \"Apollo 11,\" produced in partnership with CNN Films, there may be some things you've forgotten or never knew about the mission.Training for Apollo 11 was hectic and dangerousRead MoreIn May 1961, President John F. Kennedy set a goal many doubted would ever happen: He wanted to land a man on the moon before the decade was over. As pointed out by Charles Beames, the executive chairman at York Space Systems, Kennedy's Moonshot was part Cold War strategy. If it was successful, it would show America's dominance in the space race.To pull it off, the Apollo astronauts and the teams that supported them put in grueling hours of training. They were so busy that they didn't know much about the events of the 1960s unfolding outside of what they were doing. They would catch up on the Vietnam War and other headlines later.What it takes to be an astronaut: the real 'right stuff'But the work was also dangerous. On May 6, 1968, Armstrong performed his 22nd flight of Lunar Landing Research Vehicle No. 1 at Ellington Air Force Base outside Houston. Five minutes in, he lost control of the vehicle due to a loss of helium pressure and was ejected 200 feet above the ground as the vehicle crashed and burned on impact.Later, he would say that the Eagle, the spacecraft he and Aldrin landed on the moon, handled just like the Lunar Landing Training Vehicle, which he flew more than 30 times before Apollo 11.\"That of course gave me a good deal of confidence -- a comfortable familiarity,\" Armstrong said at the time. \"It was a contrary machine and a risky machine but a very useful one.\"The woman in the roomOn July 16, 1969, the day of Apollo 11's historic launch, rows of men in shirts and ties lined the consoles inside Kennedy Space Center. But one woman stood out -- 28-year-old JoAnn Morgan.JUST WATCHEDHow she (in a sea of men) made history during Apollo 11ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHow she (in a sea of men) made history during Apollo 11 00:10Morgan, who worked as an instrumentation controller for the mission, was the only woman allowed inside the firing room where NASA employees were locked during Apollo 11's historic liftoff.Morgan needed to be in the room to alert the test team if anything went wrong, but she had to get special permission to be there. Morgan also endured obscene phone calls and had to use the men's restroom because there weren't any for women.She went on to pave a path as one of NASA's first female engineers. After Apollo 11, Morgan's career took off. From 1958 to 2003, she continued to break barriers and became the first female senior executive at the Kennedy Space Center.And the woman who helped land men on the moonMargaret Hamilton was the software engineer who developed the onboard computer programs that powered NASA's Apollo missions, including the 1969 moon landing.Hamilton effectively invented the term \"software engineer\" with her work developing the Apollo guidance computer, the lifeline for astronauts that controlled the spacecraft. The computer processor on the Apollo 11's lunar module nearly overloaded as the craft neared the moon, which could have forced Armstrong and Aldrin to abort, according to Google, which is honoring Hamilton on the lunar landing anniversary.Her software put men on the moon. Fifty years later, Margaret Hamilton got a glowing moonlit tribute But the software cleared all tasks each time it neared overload, allowing the astronauts to enter the landing commands. The software's emergency preparedness is thought to have helped save the mission, Hamilton wrote.For the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission,  Google unveiled a giant tribute to Hamilton in California's Mojave Desert: More than 107,000 mirrors were positioned to reflect moonlight and form her image for one night on the grounds of the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System, the world's largest solar thermal power plant.Armstrong was 'Mr. Cool' The Apollo 11 crew of Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins traveled 240,000 miles in 76 hours to reach the moon. Collins remained in the spacecraft, Columbia, while Armstrong and Aldrin headed to the lunar surface in the Eagle.As Aldrin and Armstrong approached, Armstrong had to take control and navigate beyond the targeted landing spot. Boulders littered the area, and even though they were running dangerously low on fuel, Armstrong piloted the lander like a helicopter and landed in the perfect spot, all while alarms sounded warnings. When the lunar module landed on the moon, it had less than 40 seconds of fuel left. Years later, Apollo 11 flight dynamics team leader Jerry Bostick asked Armstrong what he would have done if Houston had called for an abort during the landing phase. \"And he said, 'Well, I probably would have said, \"Say again Houston, I didn't copy that,\" and gone ahead and landed.' And he would have. And he would have done it. That's how much confidence that I and the other people involved had in Neil Armstrong. He could do the impossible,\" Bostick said.It was this dynamic that earned Armstrong the nickname \"Mr. Cool.\" Some people called him \"First Man.\"When America seemed divided beyond repair, something great came out of itAfter the successful Apollo 11 flight, Collins saw another side of Armstrong as the three astronauts embarked on a trip around the world to talk about their experiences. Armstrong was their spokesman.\"But what people maybe don't know about First Man was that First Man was one marvelous proponent of the virtues of the United States and spread those all over the globe,\" Collins said.What the moon landing looked likeThe historic moment of Armstrong stepping on the moon roughly six hours later was actually quite blurry as it was seen on TV. The shot came from a camera attached to the lander.But what many don't know is that Aldrin was filming Armstrong, too; he captured those monumental steps from above, while inside the lander, looking down the ladder at Armstrong.Apollo fans and experts have long known about this angle. But the public hasn't previously seen it uncut and in high-resolution, a view that expands our knowledge of the mission. It can be seen in the \"Apollo 11\" film. And then there are the photos. While the lunar surface looks quite alien up close, some of the most breathtaking images were captured when the astronauts turned the camera back to the view of Earth from space.

The last was in 1972.Hide Caption 18 of 18\"Strangely enough, it looks fragile somehow,\" Collins said. \"You want to take care of it. You want to nurture it. You want to be good to it. All the beauty, it was wonderful, it was tiny, it's our home, everything I knew, but fragile, strange.\"Collins wasn't the 'loneliest man'While Aldrin and Armstrong landed on the moon, Collins kept circling it. Once Armstrong and Aldrin were finished, he would rendezvous and dock with the Eagle after it left the lunar surface. Collins was often called \"the loneliest man\" once he returned to Earth, but he didn't feel that way -- even when he lost contact with Mission Control during his flybys on the far side of the moon. NASA's 'loneliest man'? Far from it: Astronaut Michael Collins on the 'cathedral' of Apollo 11\"It was a happy home. I liked Columbia,\" he said. \"It reminded me, in a way, of almost like a church or a cathedral. It had the apse, the three couches, and then you went down into where the altar was. That was the guidance and navigation system. And it was laid out almost like a cathedral. And I had hot coffee. I had music I could play if I wanted to. I had people to talk to on the radio, sometimes too many people talking too much on the radio. So I enjoyed that interlude. Being by myself in a machine up in the air somewhere was not unknown to me, and so everything was working well within Columbia, and I enjoyed it.\"A meal on the moon The first meal eaten in space was in the spring of 1961 by Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. He had pureed meat in a squeezable toothpaste-style tube, followed by a tube of chocolate sauce. The Apollo 11 astronauts, meanwhile, had more than 70 food items to choose from. Among the foods that were eaten on the surface of the moon in the lunar module were beef stew, bacon squares, date fruit cake and grape punch.Floating food: The history of eating in spaceAstronauts roaming the lunar surface also had drinking devices with water installed in their space suits, and if they were peckish they could nibble on the high nutrient food bar in their helmet.400,000 people worked on the Apollo 11 missionThe full triumph of Apollo 11 doesn't just belong to the astronauts. It also includes the 400,000 people that supported the mission across the country, mainly at Johnson Space Center in Houston and Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.Young college graduates flocked to NASA after Kennedy's 1961 speech. 'We did the impossible': What it was like inside Apollo 11's Mission Control During Apollo 11, everyone who could possibly be needed or called upon during the mission was in a room at Cape Canaveral or Houston. They each had a specific task. And they all wanted to be there. They jockeyed for places to plug in their headsets and sat on steps.\"It was a can-do attitude,\" said Bostick, the flight dynamics team leader. \"We were very sober and somber in what we were doing. We took it very seriously. We worked very hard. But at the same time it was fun, we really didn't think of it as a job, even though we were working 12 hours a day at least, six days a week. We didn't understand the magnitude of what we were doing.\"Mission Control was more than a roomThe small room depicted in movies often shows team leaders sitting at consoles and staring at monitors. But to accommodate the thousands of people needed, team members were in various control rooms, staff support rooms, back rooms, simulators, computing complexes and the projection room known as the \"batcave.\"JUST WATCHEDSee Apollo Mission Control restored to look like it's 1969ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSee Apollo Mission Control restored to look like it's 1969 01:20Over the years, Apollo Mission Control and its surrounding rooms fell into disrepair. Recently, it was restored and reopened. Apollo flight controllers worked on the project to make sure it was authentic -- down to the carpet, wallpaper and even the cigarette butts in the ashtrays.NASA had an art programArt was a priority for NASA's second administrator, Jim Webb. He established NASA's art program in 1962 and allowed artists to start coming to the agency in 1963. He saw a need for art to capture the history that was being made and portray it for the American people. The artists were given free rein.Art and space: 'A quest never to end'Norman Rockwell's famous painting of astronauts Gus Grissom and John Young originated during the early days of the program, in 1965. Andy Warhol painted a silkscreen series of Aldrin standing on the moon next to the American flag.Apollo 11 opened the door to space\"The Apollo program made space accessible to us,\" said Mason Peck, former NASA chief technologist and professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Cornell University. \"Those brief visits to the moon set a high bar for NASA and for all space exploration since.\"In order for Apollo to be possible, NASA had to build a complex system. Spaceflight navigation had to be configured. Although there was a foundation of the mechanics of flight in the military, space was new territory. Everything was new. Apollo even helped trigger the formation of planetary science as its own field.Why the 1969 moon landing still inspires space explorers today\"It really built a infrastructure that didn't exist,\" said Marshall Smith, NASA's director of human lunar exploration. The program created a boost for technology and economy and allowed for the return of lunar samples to Earth, enabling a better understanding of our solar system's history.\"The Apollo program, which saw 12 men walk on the surface of the moon, was shuttered after the final flight of Apollo 17, in 1972. But by 2024, NASA vows to land the first woman on the moon with the Artemis program. Thom Patterson, Sarah-Grace Mankarious, Natalie Angley, Scottie Andrew and Katherine Dillinger contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)The astronauts selected for the first human mission to Mars will need to have more than \"the right stuff.\" People on this very long mission will need to possess an eagerness for doing the right thing, too. Conscientiousness, defined as \"wishing to do what is right, especially to do one's work or duty well and thoroughly,\" has emerged as the key trait requirement for astronauts that will live and work on the surface of Mars millions of miles from Earth, according to a new study.This trait was identified as more important than honesty, humility, emotionality, extroversion, openness and agreeableness. \"Conscientiousness, an individual personality trait, can be thought of as a pooled team-resource,\" said Julia McMenamin, the study's first author and a doctoral student in psychology at Western University in Canada, in a statement. \"The more conscientiousness a team is, the better they will likely be at accomplishing tasks.\" Meet NASA's first astronaut graduates of the Artemis program, eligible for missions to the moon and MarsThe study published last week in the journal Astrobiology.Read MoreConversely, traits like \"social loafing,\" or the habit of a team member putting in less effort than when they work solo, are undesirable in a potential Marstronaut. Traits that seem counterproductive and negative behaviors are likely to cause more trouble and disruptions in a team environment. The researchers consider these traits and behavior \"non-negotiable\" for long-duration spaceflight crews. Analog astronauts I\u00f1igo Mu\u00f1oz Elorza and Carmen K\u00f6hler perform an experiment during the 2018 mission in Oman.A careful focus on crew selection, emphasizing effective communication and very detailed work and planning processes, could help avoid any negative factors. Some of the same things identified in the study could be used to help people coping with isolation during the pandemic as well.Simulating a mission to MarsCurrently, NASA is targeting the 2030s for the first human mission to Mars. Depending on the alignment of Mars and Earth for launch and landing and the duration of the mission on the Martian surface, this crew could spend five years together -- not including training together beforehand. To test what this crew dynamic might be like ahead of a real mission, researchers studied a team of five \"astronauts\" during an exercise analogous to a Mars mission. This event was hosted by the Austrian Space Forum in Oman in 2018.  The Dhofar region of Oman is a good analog for the Martian environment in terms of isolation and extreme conditions.  McMenamin was joined by Natalie Allen, a professor of psychology at Western Univeristy, and Ottawa-based space exploration company Mission Control Space Services Chief Science Officer Melissa Battler for the study. What it takes to be an astronaut: the real 'right stuff'The AMADEE-18 analog space mission lasted for four weeks. Five astronauts, including four men and one woman between the ages of 28 to 38, lived in a simulated Mars environment. Before, during and after the mission, the astronauts filled out surveys addressing the performance of their team and any team conflicts as well as their stress levels. At the end of the mission, the astronauts rated themselves and each teammate. They also answered questions about their behavior in their respective roles and identified any counterproductive behaviors, including social loafing. NASA, European Space Agency to collaborate on Artemis Gateway lunar outpostThis particular team worked well together as a team, but the researchers were not surprised because they had prepared for their \"mission.\" The team was also supported by field and mission control teams. The team members were also familiar with each other before the mission began. All of these factors can be identified in examples of positive teamwork on Earth, the researchers said. Analog astronauts Joao Lousada and Stefan Dobrovolny are pictured here before sunset.\"How familiar team members are with one another has been shown to help teams work better together likely because it provides team members with knowledge about each other and helps them communicate better and more efficiently,\" McMenamin said. NASA outlines $28 billion plan to land the first woman on the Moon by 2024Stress is a common negative factor that can influence team performance on Earth and in space. It's distracting, increases anxiety, causes cooperative difficulty, increases task overload and contributes to destructive emotions. \"Anyone who has worked on a team knows conflict amongst team members can harm team performance and make for a negative experience. When people argue about how to get things done, or get into personal disagreements, there is less time and energy left for completing tasks,\" McMenamin said. \"What's interesting is that there are different types of conflict, and so long as interpersonal issues and arguments about how to go about accomplishing tasks are avoided, differences in views and opinions might actually improve team performance likely because this allows for the team to benefit from each member's knowledge and perspective.\"An antioxidant in red wine might power astronauts on Mars, study saysGiven that this particular analog mission only lasted for about a month, the researchers are interested to know how things might play out over the course of a long-duration mission. \"Major issues caused by psychological distress and interpersonal problems don't tend to show up until months or even years spent in an isolated, confined, and extreme environment, which highlights the need for longer-duration simulations,\" McMenamin said.Teamwork makes the dream workBeing a good team player has almost always been part of the astronaut playbook, going back to the days of the Apollo missions. Former NASA astronaut Mike Massimino spoke to CNN in September about the Netflix series \"Away,\" which focuses on an international crew leading the first human mission to Mars. Massimino served as a consultant for the show. The show crew was most interested in hearing about the human side of being an astronaut, Massimino said. For example, they asked him about the emotional aspects of leaving your family behind on Earth, the camaraderie between the crew and \"what it's like in your heart and soul, rather than the process,\" he said. Massimino, who flew on multiple missions during the Shuttle era, told them that \"the Earth looks like heaven. It makes you realize we're so lucky to be here.\"STS-125 Mission Specialist Mike Massimino is pictured here working with the Hubble Space Telescope in the cargo bay of the Earth-orbiting space shuttle Atlantis in 2009.Regarding the teamwork aspect of spaceflight, \"we really do love each other as astronauts,\" Massimino said. \"It's like a hybrid between a family member and a friend. You really do care about each other. And there were seven of us on the Shuttle crew. We became like a family, having all of these experiences in training and spaceflight. They're extraordinary and there is not anything I wouldn't do for these people.\"Massimino was selected to be an astronaut in 1996. When asked about the traits that would be important for astronauts going to Mars, he said he feels that the selection process would be similar to the way NASA chooses astronaut candidates now for long-term spaceflight on the International Space Station. More than 12,000 people want to be part of NASA's next class of astronauts\"We're looking for people who would be good candidates for long-duration spaceflight that get along, personalities that would let things roll. If things go wrong, you make mistakes because you're not perfect, you need to be able to roll with it. They should be able to contribute and be a good positive crew member, not only for their crewmates, but the people helping them back on Earth.\"One of the most important aspects that helps the crew's morale and performance is a connection to Earth and the people they care about on it -- something that will be increasingly more difficult as a spacecraft leaves Earth for Mars, causing communication delays. People tend to think of astronauts as superheroes, Massimino said. \"But we're really just regular people who care about each other and have really awesome jobs.\"",

But this time, they may have gone too far.The brand showcased its men's fall/winter 2020 line this week at Paris Fashion Week. A key part of the runaway look, amid the bright colors and cropped jackets, appeared to be lace front cornrow wigs and the effect is, uh, debatable.The wigs have gotten much scrutiny from the internet, with some calling the look cultural appropriation \u2014 especially since the fashion house used majority white models for an aesthetic strongly linked to black culture.The hair artist for the show has since apologized on Instagram. But the use of the wigs wasn't the only aspect that came under scrutiny. The wigs were placed atop the models' heads like hats, nearly covering their foreheads. The final product looks, some people said, ridiculous.\"Can't even be mad because of how ridiculously ugly this is,\" wrote Twitter user Tantine P. Read More\"Why the cornrows devouring they foreheads like that,\" asked Twitter user Johnny Boy.  Not every model wore the wigs, though. A few of the black models, who had longer hair, were spared.Julien d'Ys, the hair artist for the show, said the idea was inspired by the hairstyles of ancient Egyptian princes, and apologized on Instagram for the offense.

        "content": "(CNN)It's invisible in the night sky, but above us there is a cloud of more than 9,000 tons of space junk -- equivalent to the weight of 720 school buses.This debris is composed of parts of old satellites as well as entire defunct satellites and rocket bodies. The debris poses risks to the International Space Station and threatens things we take for granted on Earth -- weather forecasting, GPS and telecommunications. It's a problem that's getting worse with more and more satellites being launched each year by ventures like Elon Musk's SpaceX.A demonstration mission to test new technology developed by the company Astroscale to clean up space debris is set to launch in the early hours of Saturday from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. A Soyuz 2 rocket will launch a 175-kilogram spacecraft with a satellite attached into space. The spacecraft and the 17-kilogram satellite -- the debris to be cleaned up -- will separate and then perform a high-stakes game of cat and mouse over the next few months. Why we don't know exactly what happened during a near-collision in spaceAstroscale will test the spacecraft's ability to snatch a satellite and bring it down toward the Earth's atmosphere, where it will burn up. It will do this in a series of different maneuvers, with the mission expected to end in September or October of this year. Read MoreAs part of the mission, the company will test whether the spacecraft can catch and dock with the satellite as it tumbles through space at up to 17,500 miles per hour -- several times faster than the speed of a bullet. The tests rely on a magnetic docking plate to latch onto the satellite. Astroscale said it hopes all new satellites being launched will ultimately have this docking plate, allowing them to be safely removed at the end of their life span. What's more, Astroscale said it had already signed a deal with internet satellite company OneWeb. \"Now is the time to take the threat of debris seriously by committing to debris removal programs and preparing satellites for future removal at their end of life,\" said John Auburn, managing director of Astroscale UK and group chief commercial officer.  \"Avoiding catastrophic collisions will help to protect the space ecosystem and ensure all orbits can continue to thrive sustainably for generations to come.\"  Astroscale is headquartered in Japan but the mission is being controlled from the United Kingdom. The mission will last for about six months. Nets, harpoons and robotic armsThe technology being tested in this mission targets the removal of satellites yet to be launched and doesn't address the problem of debris already in space. However, the company is working with JAXA, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, on its first debris removal project.Other space agencies, institutions and companies are also working on technology to remove space junk.A dead Soviet satellite and an old rocket booster narrowly missed each other in spaceClearSpace 1, the European Space Agency's mission to remove space junk from orbit, is expected to launch in 2025. This mission will use four robotic arms to capture the debris.A 2018 demonstration mission successfully deployed a net to ensnare space junk, the first successful demonstration of space cleanup technology. The RemoveDebris experiment is run by a consortium of companies and researchers led by the UK's Surrey Space Centre and includes Airbus, Airbus-owned Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. and France's Ariane Group. It has also tried a method using a harpoon.There are at least 26,000 pieces of space junk orbiting the Earth that are the size of a softball or larger and could destroy a satellite on impact; over 500,000 the size of a marble big enough to cause damage to spacecraft or satellites; and over 100 million pieces of debris the size of a grain of salt that could puncture a spacesuit, according to a January report by NASA.In fact, the report said, the bits of space junk that are most dangerous to spacecraft and satellites are often the smallest because they are too small to be detected, and operators aren't able to maneuver to avoid them.",

        "content": "Story highlightsNew research links hormonal birth control to depression\"Adolescents seemed more vulnerable to this risk than women,\" study saysHowever, the findings won't change how one doctor says she counsels patients (CNN)Taking hormonal birth control might be associated with an increased risk for depression compared with those who don't use contraception, according to a new study published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry last week. The finding is something that users have long suspected, as about 30% of women who ever used the pill in the United States eventually quit because of dissatisfaction with side effects, according to a 2013 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (PDF).For birth control, what's old is new again\"We have known for decades that women's sex hormones estrogen and progesterone have an influence on many women's mood. Therefore, it is not very surprising that also external artificial hormones acting in the same way and on the same centers as the natural hormones might also influence women's mood or even be responsible for depression development,\" said Dr. \u00d8jvind Lidegaard, a professor at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark and lead supervisor of the study.Lidegaard and his colleagues tracked the health of more than 1 million Danish women between the ages of 15 and 34 over 14 years, using data from the National Prescription Register and the Psychiatric Central Research Register in Denmark.To ensure that depression was properly identified in connection with birth control use, women with a depression diagnosis before their 15th birthdays or the start of the data collection were excluded.Read MoreAfter analyzing the data, the researchers found that the use of hormonal birth control was positively linked to a subsequent depression diagnosis and use of antidepressants.Depression risk, by the numbersAmong all hormonal birth control users in the study, there was a 40% increased risk of depression after six months, compared to women who did not use hormonal birth control, the researchers found. The mean age of birth control users in the study was 24.Do you know what an IUD is? Many don'tThe users of combined oral birth control pills experienced a 1.2-fold higher rate of subsequently taking antidepressants during the study period than those not using the birth control. Women who used progestin-only birth control pills experienced a 1.3-fold higher rate, according to the study. As for non-oral forms of hormonal birth control, those who used the transdermal patch had a two-fold increased risk and those who used the vaginal ring had a 1.5-fold increased risk.Similar rate increases were found for depression diagnoses, according to the study.The researchers noted in their study that the difference in risk rates among women taking non-oral and oral forms of birth control might be due to a difference in dose rather than how the contraceptives are administered. All teens should be screened for depression, task force recommends The researchers also noted that this association does not imply that birth control alone causes depression -- and more research is needed to better understand the possible link.\"Adolescents seemed more vulnerable to this risk than women 20 to 34 years old. Further studies are warranted to examine depression as a potential adverse effect of hormonal contraceptive use,\" the researchers wrote in their study.One of the study authors has a history of consulting for two pharmaceutical companies, Lundbeck and AstraZeneca, and another author reported receiving funds for talks from Exeltis. No other conflicts of interest were disclosed.Lidegaard said the study results could translate to women in the United States.JUST WATCHEDIs Nuvaring more harmful than other birth control?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHIs Nuvaring more harmful than other birth control? 09:19In the United States, about 62% of women 15 to 44 years old use some form of contraception (PDF). Among those women, 16% use the pill, 15.5% use female sterilization, and 7.2% use long-acting reversible contraception, such as an IUD or implant, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. What this new data means for womenWhat do other experts think of the new study? Dr. Kathryn Holloway, an ob-gyn practitioner at the Institute for Women's Health in San Antonio, Texas, called it impressive. However, while there may be a correlation between hormonal birth control with the prescription of antidepressants and perhaps a depression diagnosis, causation is hard to prove, she said.\"Although this study suggests an increased risk of depression with combined hormonal contraception, the increase does not seem so great as to significantly change how I counsel patients,\" Holloway said, adding that, \"Depression is not something to be taken lightly and should not be a missed diagnosis. It is important for physicians to monitor and evaluate for any possible side effects, even if rare, with any prescribed medication.\"JUST WATCHEDThe pill's benefits to women's health ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe pill's benefits to women's health  04:16While birth control comes with some negative side effects, from stomach cramps to increased risk of stroke, it can also provide some health benefits.Hormonal birth control not only prevents unwanted pregnancies, but also can regulate menstrual cycles, treat endometriosis pelvic pain, control symptoms of fibroids, help acne breakouts, and reduce the risk of some cancers that affect reproductive organs.There are some forms of birth control that are not hormonal, Holloway said.Join the conversationSee the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\"Hormonal contraception options range from the combined oral contraceptive pills to an intrauterine device and a birth control shot such as Depo-Provera,\" Holloway said. \"Non-hormonal contraception options include condoms, cervical caps, the vaginal sponge and spermicide, and the copper IUD,\" she added. \"Some patients are successful with natural family planning by monitoring their cycle on a calendar or menstrual cycle app. It's up to the patient and their ob-gyn to decide which method of birth control is right for their lifestyle and well-being.\"",

        "content": "New Delhi (CNN)While hospitals plead for life-saving oxygen and Covid-19 patients die in their thousands, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi is pushing ahead with a $1.8 billion parliamentary revamp -- including a new home for the country's leader. The decision to continue with the project in the capital, New Delhi, has infuriated the public and opposition politicians, who have pointed to the apparent disconnect in pouring millions into a construction project when the country is struggling with its worst-ever public health crisis. The pricey renovation, known as the Central Vista Redevelopment Project, has been categorized as an \"essential service,\" meaning construction is allowed to continue even when most other building projects have been halted.Construction work underway on the Central Vista redevelopment project at Rajpath on April 17, 2021 in New Delhi, India. Two citizens -- including one with Covid-19 whose mother also has the virus -- lodged a case with the Delhi High Court on Wednesday to try to halt construction, which has continued even while the capital is in lockdown.The petitioners argue the parliament buildings don't constitute an essential service and construction work could even become a Covid super-spreader event, according to special leave petition filed by lawyer Nitin Saluja. Workers are continuing to be ferried from their labor camp to the construction site, according to the document.Read MoreThe High Court offered to hear the case later this month, but petitioners took the matter to the Supreme Court, arguing the lower court had \"failed to appreciate the gravity\" of the situation. \"Since there is a public health emergency in the matter, any delay could be detrimental to the larger public interest,\" Saluja wrote to the Supreme Court. Saluja said the case will most likely be heard Friday.India has reported more than 3,000 Covid-19 deaths in each of the past few days. The country accounted for a quarter of global coronavirus fatalities over the past week, according to the World Health Organization's (WHO) weekly Covid-19 report. Vanity project?Even before the second wave, Central Vista had attracted controversy, with critics saying the redevelopment would come at the cost of history and heritage. But opposition has become more heated recently, with politicians slamming the plan as a vanity project. Proponents of the 86-acre (35-hectare) revamp say it is necessary as the current 100-year-old buildings are not fit for purpose.\"The launch of the construction of the Parliament House of India, with the idea of Indianness by Indians, is one of the most important milestones of our democratic traditions,\" Modi said in December at the laying of the building's foundation stone. \"We the people of India will construct this new Parliament building together.\"Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a rally on April 12, 2021, in North 24 Parganas, India.An estimated 46,700 people are expected to be temporarily employed during construction, according to minutes released last week of an April expert appraisal committee meeting.That meeting estimated the expansion of the parliament building and construction of a new parliament building will be completed in November 2022, while the Prime Minister's residence is set to be finished in December 2022. The entire project is set to be completed by the end of 2026. The $1.8 billion project was given environmental approval from an expert panel of the Environment Ministry earlier this year, essentially giving the project the green light. But as coronavirus cases have soared, so too has the backlash to Modi's project. \n\n\"People are dying of Covid but (Prime Minister Modi's) priority is the Central Vista project,\" tweeted Yashwant Sinha, the former minister of finance and external affairs. \"Should we not be building hospitals instead? How much more price the nation must pay for electing a meglomaniac?\" Earlier this week, opposition MP Rahul Gandhi said: \"The (Prime Minister's) ego is bigger than people's lives.\" In a previous tweet, Gandhi said: \"Central Vista - not essential. Central (Government) with a vision - essential.\" Community Party of India's Sitaram Yechury called the move \"grotesque.\"The criticism has gone beyond politicians. On Twitter, some people have even drawn comparisons between Modi and Nero, the Roman emperor who, according to legend, fiddled while Rome burned.The project is just the latest mark against Modi, who has been criticized for his handling of the second wave. Even as cases skyrocketed, critics say he underplayed the risk and continued to hold mass political rallies ahead of state elections.",

She'd been loaned the board from a male friend. That gesture, she says, was the most pivotal moment of her life so far, guiding her towards a ground-breaking career as India's first professional female skateboarder.  \"I felt like nothing existed outside of that skate park,\" the 23-year-old skater tells CNN. \"That moment I had -- it was perfect.\" In 2015, she co-founded Girl Skate India, an initiative that teaches girls how to skate, promotes gender equality and brings together skateboarders in India through workshops.At the end of 2015, the group organized 12 skaters from nine countries to embark on an all-female four-city skate tour -- the first in India -- using the sport to empower underprivileged girls around the country.Read MoreIf anyone is an advert for the power of the skateboard, it's Verghese. Rebel with a cause Atita Verghese during the Girl Skate India tour in 2015.Growing up in Bangalore, Verghese had a strong female role model in her mother, Nalini.After Verghese's father passed away when she was eight years old, Nalini became the breadwinner, running a guesthouse and bringing up her two daughters alone.Rebellion against social norms was in Verghese's DNA. Before Verghese was born, her mother -- a non-Muslim -- was attacked with acid by strangers for wearing Western-style clothes, in the small village of Hassan, in southwest India, where she lived. \"The only explanation was that (the perpetrators) got annoyed by what she was wearing,\" Verghese says. Nalini preferred shorts and skirts to saris. Women, back then, were expected to wear \"modest\" traditional outfits, Verghese says. \"She was known mostly to be seen mostly in Western outfits that were sometimes too much for the villagers to handle, apparently,\" Verghese explains, adding that the attack took place in \"a village that was way more closed-minded than Bangalore city.\"Miraculously, Nalini escaped without any scarring, but the perpetrators were never caught. \"She was really lucky,\" says Verghese, \"but her clothes were burnt.\"Verghese also didn't conform to her conservative society's ideas of how a girl should act.I was doing a lot of pranks ... none of the girls were doing things like that.Atita Verghese\"Growing up, I played football, basketball, hockey. I swam. I also did long-jump -- all of it,\" she tells CNN.\"I didn't study or get the best grades in school. I was always getting in trouble. I was doing a lot of pranks and things. They would expect that from the boys -- none of the girls were doing things like that.\"Her teachers warned that she would become a failure if she continued acting this way, she says. Verghese didn't let their opinions hold her back.  Welcome to the skate parkIt wasn't until 2013, when Verghese was 19, that she got on a skateboard -- a sport that has only started to gain popularity in India during the past decade. It was friend Abhishek Shakenbake who introduced her to the sport in a skate park in Bangalore, where they are both based.\"He would meet me (after school) with a skateboard,\" Verghese remembers. \"I was really curious and was like, 'What is it?'\" He taught her \"a few of the basics.\"A self-taught skateboarder who picked up the sport in 2010 after a law school classmate brought him a skateboard from overseas, Abhishek, now aged 31, co-founded HolyStoked Collective in 2011. It went on to become one of the biggest skate shops in Bangalore.  During a workshop, Verghese teaches kids how to skateboard.\"(Skating) was kind of an outlet for most of us,\" Abhishek tells CNN.  \"We didn't all have skateboards, but there were more of us coming together to skate -- so we decided to start a crew to ... find a solution for problems like (lack of) space and equipment.\"Back in 2010, there must have been, like, six people who were skating in India, according to our  (Abhishek and his fellow skaters) research. We found maybe only two other people who were skating before us.\"            'I just wanted some girl power'Verghese turned out to be a quick learner. But still without her own board, she had to wait for other skaters at the park to take breaks, then ask to borrow theirs.Towards the end of 2013, Abhishek had a surplus of skateboards and was gifting them to those he thought had a serious interest in the sport -- Verghese was selected. Back then, the skatepark was a male-dominated realm, but Verghese says no one has ever asked her why she was there. It was perhaps obvious that she was in her element. Two other girls came along \"for a short time\" before dropping out, she says.      Not content with just skateboarding for fun, Verghese started working with HolyStoked, organizing skateboarding classes for youngsters in Bangalore. But she wanted to put together events in other regions to get more people into the sport.  In 2014, Lisa Jacob, a Paris-based skateboarder, traveled to India and was advised by friends in the skateboarding world to get in touch with Verghese. At the time, Verghese was in Kovalam, Kerala, building a skate park with Sebastian Indian Social Projects (SISP), a local NGO that uses skateboarding and surfing as incentives to get disadvantaged children who have dropped out of school back into the classroom.         Jacob, along with Netherlands-based skateboarder Louisa Menke, joined Verghese on the project. \"Lisa's been in the skateboard scene for about 20 years now, so she knows a lot of people,\" explains Verghese. \"We were talking about what we could do to kick off the scene a little bit (in India).\"In 2015, Girl Skate India -- an international collective of female skaters who engage with underprivileged youngsters through skating -- was born.In December that year, the group put on the first ever tour of female skaters across India, featuring 12 women from nine countries.Skaters on the tour included Chlo\u00e9 Bernard of Marseilles, France; Monica Shaw of Melbourne, Australia; Berlin-based Linda Ritterhof of Germany; and Roxana Cernicky of Liege, Belgium.The project was entirely self-funded. \"Everyone took care of themselves,\" Verghese says.The group traveled to Kovalam, Bangalore, Goa and Hampi, where they put on skate workshops and skate yoga lessons, as well as built ramps.Verghese works with various charities, including SISP, which uses activities like skateboarding to incentivize kids to study.\"I learned how to use the tools and how long to wait for the concrete and the different steps that go into actually building a concrete skate park,\" she explains. \"After that there was a whole fire spreading across the country because people just wanted to build more and more.\"For Verghese, forming the collective came from a desire to motivate women to pick up skateboarding -- but that was not all. \"I wanted to skate with girls, honestly. It was selfish,\" she admits.\"I just needed some girl power in this part of the world, where there's hardly any of that. I wanted more girls to come skate, and spread the word so that hopefully it would get other girls interested.\"The beginning of a movementAfter the tour wrapped up in January 2016, Verghese, then 22 years old, had become a well-known face on the international skateboarding circuit. But it wasn't because she was taking part in competitions, of which there are \"hardly any\" in India, she says.I didn't know how big it was going to end up being.Atita Verghese\"I guess the skate world is really small ... so if you do something that stands out, you get noticed,\" she says. \"For me, I think this tour kicked things off faster and (gave me) a wider reach, as there were people from nine different countries on it.\"(People) absolutely loved what I did. I was shocked ... I didn't know how big it was going to end up being.\"Girl Skate India put out a short film about their work, which ended up being shown in 20 locations worldwide.         \"Something special was happening,\" she says. \"I think it was important to show the rest of the community what we were doing, because otherwise they wouldn't know.\"Today, Verghese works with various organizations all over the world as a volunteer, including international non-profit Make Life Skate Life, which has built free skate parks in Bolivia, Jordan, Ethiopia, and Myanmar, as well as India, and Janwaar Castle, which aims to unite children and break the caste system in India through skateboarding. Verghese works on building a ramp inside a skate park.To date, she has helped build four skate parks in India, as well as one in Belgium. HolyStoked as a collective has built around 10.As her reputation has grown, she has worked as a skate stunt double in commercials and appeared in UK rock band Wild Beasts' \"Alpha Female\" music video. In 2016 Vans India became her sponsor; others include UK-based sports company Extreme, and US brand Stanley Tools.Although she's often referred to as India's first female professional skater, Verghese says that she's not quite on pro level outside of the country. \"It's quite different when it comes to India and the rest of the world. I don't know if I would say that on an international level I'm a pro-skater, because that would mean you either get your own deck model, or your own shoe model.\" A growing sceneWhether she's an international pro-skater or not, the difference Verghese has made to the skateboarding scene in India is undeniable.\"It's great Atita is doing this, not just skating for herself, but taking it forward, trying to put it out there,\" Abhishek says.\"So many girls have been getting into skateboarding during the past couple of years. I would say a lot of them might have been inspired by seeing her, the work she's done.\"\"In India, they need that. They need to see other girls succeed.\"Abhishek acknowledges that India can still be a frustrating place for women. Skateboarding, he says, can be a way \"to channel this angst that you have in a positive way.\" \"(Women in India) just need to push the boundaries and go a bit further than what is expected of them,\" Verghese says.Because skateboarding is such a new sport, he also feels it has given Verghese, and other women, a chance to make it their own, before society creates gender-based stereotypes around it. In India ... They need to see other girls succeed.Abhishek, founder, HolyStoked\"In India, if a girl goes ahead and does something which she's not supposed to -- in terms of what social norms dictate -- automatically there's a bunch of people who get offended and (say) 'This is not our culture,'\" Abhishek says.\"But with skateboarding, it's something new. Either way, it's not our culture,\" he adds. Verghese agrees it's a blank canvas. \"In the US, for example, people think skateboarders are rebels. If they're in the skate park they're up to  no good,\" she says. \"These things (stereotypes), they don't really exist (in India), because the scene is really new.\"For her part, Verghese has used skateboarding as a chance to embrace a different female identity -- one that has allowed her to cut her hair short, have facial piercings and wear clothes that are not typically feminine.Like her mother, she is challenging female stereotypes.\"Yes, it strays from the typical ideal of femininity,\" she says of her look. \"Many people were confused looking at me when I had shorter hair, (and were) unsure of my gender when they'd see me skate.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)A professor from Laney College in Oakland has been placed on administrative leave after asking a student to \"Anglicize\" her name.On the second day of class, Laney College mathematics professor Matthew Hubbard asked Phuc Bui Diem Nguyen to \"Anglicize\" her name because \"Phuc Bui sounds like an insult in English,\" Hubbard told Nguyen in an email obtained by CNN.  Nguyen told CNN she was shocked and felt disrespected upon receiving the email.Nguyen said the professor had never seen her before or asked her how to pronounce her name.  'Am I racist?' You may not like the answerNguyen replied back to Hubbard's email and told him his request feels \"discriminatory\" and warned him she would file a Title IX complaint if he did not refer to her by her birth name. He responded by saying her name in English sounds like \"F Boy.\"Read MoreHubbard added, \"If I lived in Vietnam and my name in your language sounded like Eat a D, I would change it to avoid embarrassment.\" He also repeated his request in the reply.Laney College President Tammeil Gilkerson said in a statement on Thursday that the college was aware of the incident.\"We are aware of the allegations of racist and xenophobic messages from a faculty member at our college with a student about the pronunciation of their name,\" Laney College said. \"We take these allegations seriously and immediately placed the faculty member on administrative leave pending an investigation.\" Hubbard declined CNN's request to offer any additional comments on the incident other than what he told The New York Times.\"The first email was a mistake, and I made it thinking about another student willing to Anglicize,\" Hubbard told The Times. \"But it's a big difference with someone doing it voluntarily and asking someone to do it. The second email is very offensive, and if I had waited eight hours, I would've written something very different.\"Nguyen, who is a freshman at the community college, said she felt empowered not to change her name at his insistence.University provost says this professor's views are 'racist, sexist and homophobic' -- but says he won't be fired\"I decided to fully embrace it and let everyone know that they should be proud of their name,\" Nguyen said.Through this incident, Nguyen said she was able to raise awareness of what's happening and has helped others be prouder of their culture and identity.Nguyen said she is still waiting for a sincere and professional apology from Hubbard.Nguyen's sister, Quynh, said Hubbard gave her a two-sentence apology that she felt was not professional or sincere.\"He wasn't being accountable for his actions,\" said Quynh Nguyen, who explained that her whole family is affected by it. \"I was so shocked and I was so disappointed at his ignorance and at the school.\"",

There was no indication Schaffer was involved in act of shooting itself, they said.\"Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and also with all the families and our shooting victims as a result of this incident,\" Col. Bill Bryant of the Arkansas State Police told reporters.Police believe there was \"no mass shooting intended,\" with the incident triggered by two individuals who exchanged fire around 7 p.m. CT (8 p.m. ET) Saturday at the community car show. The Dumas Police Department had one person in custody on unrelated charges, and police are searching for two additional suspects in connection with the shooting, Bryant said.Read More\"It's shocking,\" he said. \"We have a small community, a farming community in Dumas of 5,000 people and then we have an incident of multi-victims ... you don't expect that from small town Arkansas.\" Gov.

(CNN)Weeks after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, Leonard Bernstein led a performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony near the center of the no-longer divided city. The American composer and conductor tweaked the German text of \"Ode to Joy\" in the final movement, replacing the original word \"freude,\" or joy, with \"freiheit,\" which means freedom.  \"Freedom, bright spark of divinity,\" the chorus sang. \"Thy magic power reunites all that custom has divided. All men become brothers, under the sway of thy gentle wings.\"When Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the US Congress from Kyiv Wednesday, wearing a green t-shirt and sitting next to the blue-and-yellow flag of his country, the speech was also an ode to freedom -- and a plea for help to preserve it.  \"Right now the destiny of our country is being decided,\" Zelensky said. \"The destiny of our people, whether Ukrainians will be free, whether they will be able to preserve their democracy. Russia has attacked not just us, not just our land, not just our cities; it went on a brutal offensive against our values, basic human values. It threw tanks and planes against our freedom, against our right to live freely in our own country choosing our own future.\"Read MoreAs Frida Ghitis wrote, \"When America's top Democrats and Republicans rose side by side to give Zelensky a standing ovation, we knew the Ukrainian President had made his mark. Zelensky, reminding Americans what freedom really means after the country has spent years devaluing it in petty political battles, proves there is a new seriousness in the nation.\"\"As he has with other audiences, Zelensky tailored his message. Imagine being struck from the sky, as on 9/11, but every day, he told Americans. He spoke about Pearl Harbor, and he cited Martin Luther King. 'I have a dream ...,' he intoned, I can say, I have a need. I need to protect our sky,\" Ghitis noted.Teach the children\"This is a world-shaking moment in history,\" SE Cupp observed, \"one that will define a generation, one that could change our maps, and one that is already seeing horrific loss and devastation.\" She is making sure to show her 7-year-old son some of the news coverage of the Ukraine war. \"Concepts like democracy and sovereignty, freedom and war, can be vague and abstract, but as we watch a tyrant march into a sovereign nation, threatening democracy there and everywhere else, we must show our children what is happening -- what can happen to a free people, and what it looks like when the world unites to defend democratic ideals.\" As Jill Filipovic pointed out, \"No images have captured the hellishness of war quite as starkly as those taken in the aftermath of Russian troops bombing a maternity hospital in Mariupol. In one photo, a pregnant woman with a bloodied face is staggering out of a bombed building; in another, an ashen-faced woman lays on a stretcher, her left hand cradling her full belly. The woman in the second photo and her baby have now both died of their injuries.\" War takes a huge toll on everyone but can be especially cruel for women, Filipovic added. \"Pregnant women in war zones are also, like everyone else, under tremendous stress -- but that level of stress can have deadly results for mother or baby. And pregnant women, and particularly those who are having complications, simply may not be able to escape when violence strikes.\" For more:Michael A.

Roman Badanin: As a Russian journalist, this is the knock I dreadRussia's invasionWhen Vladimir Putin's forces invaded Ukraine on February 24, many people expected that Russia's military, considered the second strongest in the world, would roll over Ukraine in a matter of days. That hasn't happened. In a conversation with CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen, retired US Gen. David Petraeus assessed the war so far. \"There are many reasons for the Russians' abysmal performance,\" Petraeus said. \"They're fighting against a very determined, quite capable Ukrainian force that is composed of special ops, conventional forces, territorial forces and even private citizens, all of whom are determined not to allow Russia to achieve its objectives. They are fighting for their national survival, their homeland and their way of life, and they have the home-field advantage, knowing the terrain and communities.\"But beyond that, the Russians are just surprisingly unprofessional. They clearly have very poor standards when it comes to performing basic tactical tasks such as achieving combined arms operations, involving armor, infantry, engineers, artillery and mortars. They are very poor at maintaining their vehicles and weapon systems and have abandoned many of them. They are also poor at resupply and logistical tasks.\"Looking ahead, Petraeus observed, \"Clearly, they do not have enough forces to take, much less to control, Kyiv and some of the other major cities, but they do have missiles, rockets, artillery, and bombs and an apparent willingness to use them in a very indiscriminate fashion.\"\"And so, they continue the approach they used in Chechnya, particularly with Grozny, and in Syria, particularly with Aleppo, where they depopulated the cities by indiscriminate use of bombs. And it is going to be an endurance contest between the Russians' willingness to destroy cities and the Ukrainians' ability to survive such destruction.\"For more:Naureen Chowdhury Fink: Putin is calling in favors from Syria and Africa. It's a dangerous moveNuclear nightmareFor decades, some of the most eloquent and informed voices warning of the dangers of nuclear weapons have been physicians, among them Dr. Ira Helfand, past president of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985. This week, he and colleagues Barry Levy and Matt Bivens, wrote, \"The world is shocked by the violence in Ukrainian cities besieged by Russian forces, as they suffer under indiscriminate mortar, bomb and missile attacks. But these horrors could lead to something far worse -- escalation to nuclear war. If we are going to avoid this ultimate catastrophe, we need to work urgently for the elimination of all nuclear weapons.\"There are about 13,000 nuclear warheads around the world. \"Experts were decrying these thousands of nuclear weapons as an ongoing existential threat to humanity even before Russian President Vladimir's Putin's recent warnings that he may use Russia's nuclear weapons ... A nuclear war between Russia and NATO allies would be an unimaginable tragedy.\" In a nightmare scenario where 300 bombs are deployed, 75 to 100 million people would die the first day, with the vast majority of survivors dying \"over the coming months from radiation sickness, infectious diseases, famine and exposure,\" the physicians wrote.A helping handIn April 1999, then Vice President Al Gore announced on Ellis Island that the US would take in up to 20,000 refugees from Kosovo, who were fleeing Serbian attacks, recalled Mark Hetfield, president of HIAS, which was founded as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. More than 3 million people have fled Ukraine \"but this time, there has been no Ellis Island announcement.\" He noted that Vice President Kamala Harris talked of helping Poland with the wave of refugees entering the country while President Joe Biden only spoke of taking refugees on a conditional basis: \"If, in fact, they come all the way here.\" \"Words matter, actions matter,\" wrote Hetfield. \"When it comes to refugees and leadership, the United States is falling short on both fronts. It is getting late, but the Biden-Harris administration still has an opportunity to demonstrate American leadership by welcoming refugees -- instead of relying on Eastern Europe to shoulder that responsibility alone.\" Fallen journalistsBrent Renaud, a filmmaker working on a project about refugees for Time magazine's studio unit, was shot and killed by Russian soldiers outside Kyiv on Sunday, said the deputy chief of police in Irpin. Photojournalist Juan Arredondo also was injured in the shooting.Renaud became the first journalist on assignment from an American news organization to die during the conflict, according to The New York Times. The next day, Fox News cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski was killed along with Ukrainian journalist Oleksandra Kuvshynova when the vehicle they were traveling in came under fire. Benjamin Hall, a Fox News correspondent, was injured in the shooting.In Time, Sebastian Junger remembered Renaud as \"a highly-regarded freelancer who worked all over the world documenting some of the most violent and inhuman circumstances civilians are subjected to, including desperately poor areas of Chicago.\" \"Without the work of these brave people there could be no such thing as democracy or freedom in the world -- elections would be stolen, war crimes would be denied, injustices would be hidden,\" Junger observed. \"In a world without journalists, leaders like Vladimir Putin could claim whatever self-serving reality they wanted and remain utterly unaccountable for their crimes.\"Oily politicsThe cruelest irony of the Ukraine war, wrote Aaron David Miller, is that \"even as President Joe Biden's administration stands up for Ukraine in the face of Russia's aggression and preaches the values of democracy and freedom, it is under increasing pressure to make nice and cut deals with authoritarians.\"With oil prices increasing, the war has deepened concern about supplies from \"three authoritarian petro-states (Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and the UAE) and increased the urgency of getting to a nuclear agreement with a fourth, Iran.\" Biden chose to \"make the fight for democracy the central element of his foreign policy -- a grand struggle with authoritarians for control in the 21st century.\" But even as he opposes Putin's war, Miller wrote, he has to reckon with \"hard, cold interests\" as he decides how to deal with autocrats who can control the flow of oil. \"America's interests will continue to take precedence over values.\"Spring forward no more?With many Americans still adjusting to last weekend's time shift, the Senate passed the Sunshine Protection Act Tuesday to make Daylight Saving Time permanent. Before the vote, Sens. Edward J. Markey and Marco Rubio wrote, \"The effects of darker afternoons on our mental and physical health can be serious. The biannual transition of 'spring forward' and 'fall back' disrupts circadian sleeping patterns, causing confusion, sleep disturbances and even an elevated risk to heart health.\"\"The rate of heart attacks spikes by 24% in the days following 'spring forward' in March, according to a 2014 study from the University of Michigan.\" They argued that there are also economic and mental health benefits from a permanent shift to DST. In the Washington Post, Dana Milbank described the Senate's passage of the bill as an accident. \"There were no hearings, no discussion, no debate, and no vote,\" he wrote. \"It just happened, because nobody objected \u2014 in large part because many senators didn't even know it was happening.\"Get our free weekly newsletterSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook\"Reporting by The Post's Paul Kane and BuzzFeed's Paul McLeod indicates Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), top Republican on the commerce committee, had planned to object to the 'unanimous consent' request to pass what he calls 'bad legislation,' but decided not to at the last minute because he's focused on more pressing matters, such as the war in Ukraine.\"\"In other words, it's Vladimir Putin's fault that our clocks may change.\"Now it's up to the House and President Biden to decide if the bill will become law.'Turning Red'In the Pixar film \"Turning Red,\" anytime the lead character \"gets riled up, she transforms into a cuddly, gigantic red panda.\" As Vanessa Hua wrote, \"'Turning Red' makes the struggles of this particular 13-year-old universal as she learns who she is and wants to be -- ultimately embracing her red panda exuberance.\"\"The film is among the many movies and novels released in recent years that portray characters of Asian descent as fully human -- flawed, eccentric and dreaming of a bigger life...\" Such depictions resonate at a time when hate incidents against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have spiked. It has been a year since the Atlanta spa shootings, in which a White gunman killed eight people, six of whom were women of Asian descent. Prosecutors are treating the case as a hate crime.\"We cannot let up on protesting, organizing and voting. We must continue to support victims and improve mental health services, and address systemic racism and sexism,\" wrote Hua. \"'Turning Red' gives me hope, though, in its captivating challenge to stereotypes that can often lead people to view Asian Americans as 'other' -- the first step toward targeting them.\"For more: Govs. J.B. Pritzker and Phil Murphy: We can't address anti-AAPI hate without improving K-12 educationMarch madnessChristmas morning can't compare with Michael Croley's favorite time of year, the first weekend of March Madness. \"Before the internet, Dad brought brackets home from his office for us to fill out -- always Xeroxed copies from the Monday edition of Lexington Herald-Leader,\" Croley wrote. \"When I was ten, I won, and Dad brought home all the cash and handed it to me.\"\"I love the tournament for all the reasons any sports fan loves the tournament, but as I've gotten older, I know that I love the tournament because of these memories and how it kept me close to my brother and our father. And we were already very close.\"Croley's older brother Tim often shared the ritual of watching the NCAA tournament with him, as they munched on wings and rooted for the University of Kentucky's Wildcats as long as they were still in it.  A year ago, Croley added, \"As Tim's health worsened, neither of us filled out a bracket. We watched the games and we texted. I didn't know then that I'd never fill out a bracket again. I didn't know then that I'd never spend another long day with him, watching games deep into the night, barely able to keep our eyes open but still at it because it was March, a game was in overtime and a 13-seed had a 4-seed on the ropes.\"I hoped against what common sense and medical science told us since he was first diagnosed with lung cancer because hope was all we had left by then.\"Don't missGunisha Kaur: The country where 30 farmers die each day Claire McCully: Florida and Texas can't outlaw my familyKristen Rowe-Finkbeiner: This Equal Pay Day, let's smash the maternal wallJeffrey Toobin: Iowa and New Hampshire's preposterous reign over the Democratic primaries may soon endDavid Daley: Good news from state judges on gerrymanderingAND...Bad businessName your streaming service, pick your tale of fakery and business gone wrong:Hulu: \"The Dropout\"Apple TV+: \"WeCrashed\"Showtime: \"Super Pumped\"Netflix: \"Inventing Anna\"HBOMax: \"Succession\"The latest episode of \"The Dropout\" featured actor Amanda Seyfried, who plays Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, proclaiming that her company was \"a religion.\" The fictional Apple+ series \"Severance\" made it clearer than ever last week that the mysterious Lumon company is a cult while a trailer for \"WeCrashed\" showed its protagonist Adam Neumann of WeWork, played by Jared Leto, comparing himself to God.  Looking at a few of these shows through the lens of history, Nicole Hemmer wrote that the themes they explore aren't entirely new, finding antecedents in Herman Melville's \"Bartleby, the Scrivener,\" the 1955 novel \"The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit\" and films and shows including \"The Office\" and \"Office Space.\"But there is a difference. Shows like \"The Dropout\" and \"WeCrashed,\" Hemmer observed, \"represent a damning examination of the Silicon-Valley-centered, venture-capital-funded economy. The stories are ready-made for dramatization, stories of hubris and excess that hurtle toward an inevitable crash. But they also reveal a deep anxiety about the new economy, a sense that, at the end of the day, it creates overnight billionaires but little of lasting value.\" Investors seem \"to have no way of discerning the difference between visionary and fantastical, and ... the least scrupulous walk away with the most money, even after their ventures fail. Of course, venture capital also fuels the companies that succeed.\"",

The two have reached an apparent understanding, however, that allows her to take on different lovers, creating an unhappily-ever-after dynamic that causes some discomfort. \"Deep Water\" premiered on Hulu Friday and is available to stream now.What's happening in sportsMarch MadnessIt's still early in March Madness, but we may not see a bigger shock in the men's NCAA basketball tournament than last week's stunning defeat of the No. 2-seeded Kentucky Wildcats by the No. 15 seed Saint Peter's.

        "content": "(CNN)Here's a look at the Mexican Drug War. The Mexican government has been fighting a war with drug traffickers since December 2006. At the same time, drug cartels have fought each other for control of territory.FactsEnrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who was president from 2012 to 2018, continued the fight started by President Felipe Calderon against the cartels and drug-related violence. A huge victory for his administration was the 2014 arrest of Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, the boss of one of Mexico's most powerful drug trafficking operations, the Sinaloa cartel.Mexican drug cartels take in between $19 billion and $29 billion annually from drug sales in the US.According to a July 2020 Congressional Research Service (CRS) report, about 125,000-150,000 homicides were organized crime-related from 2006 to 2018.Read MoreThe Mexico drug war: Bodies for billions Major Cartels(Sources: DEA's 2020 National Drug Threat Assessment, US Dept of Justice, CRS reports) Beltran Leyva Organization (BLO) - Founded by the four Beltran Leyva brothers, Arturo, Carlos, Alfredo and Hector. Formerly aligned with the Sinaloa cartel. All of the brothers have been killed or arrested, but the group continues to operate in parts of Mexico through \"loose alliances\" with larger cartels, according to the US Drug Enforcement Agency's 2020 National Drug Threat Assessment (NDTA). The subgroups rely on the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, the Juarez Cartel and Los Zetas. Cartel Jalisco New Generation (CJNG) - Split from the Sinaloa Cartel in 2010, it is \"one of the most powerful and fastest growing in Mexico and the United States,\" according to the DEA assessment. The US Department of Justice believes it is \"one of the five most dangerous transnational criminal organizations in the world,\" and responsible for egregious violence, loss of life and increasing volumes of polydrug trafficking. Rub\u00e9n Oseguera Cervantes, known as \"El Mencho,\" is believed to be the group's leader. Guerreros Unidos (GU) - According to the 2020 NDTA, GU is a splinter group from the BLO and has a working relationship with the CJNG, using the same transport networks to smuggle drugs, which has increasingly become heroin, to the US.Gulf Cartel - Based in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, it started in 1920. It split with its enforcers, Los Zetas, by 2010, and the fallout between the two groups had been called the \"most violent in the history of organized crime in Mexico,\" according to a 2019 CRS report. The cartel is now splintered into small, competing gangs. Juarez Cartel and La Linea - Formerly aligned with the Sinaloa Cartel, then began fighting it for control of Ciudad Juarez and the state of Chihuahua. They still hold a stake in the major smuggling corridor between Ciudad Juarez and El Paso, Texas.La Familia Michoacana - Based in the Michoacan state. Possibly defunct as of 2011. It announced it would disband in 2010, but some cells are still active in Guerrero and Mexico states, according to a CRS report. Los Zetas Cartel - Comprised of former elite members of the Mexican military. Initially they worked as hit men for the Gulf Cartel, before becoming independent. The group has a reputation for being particularly savage and is known for massacres, killing civilians, leaving body parts in public places and posting killings on the internet. The group's main asset is not drugs, but organized violence, including theft, extortion, human smuggling and kidnapping, according to a CRS report.Sinaloa Cartel - Considered to be the dominant drug trafficking organization in Mexico, but some experts believe in may be in decline due to recent infighting between factions and the rise of CJNG. It was founded and led by Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, who was arrested in 2014, escaped in July 2015, and rearrested in January 2016. He was convicted in a US federal court in February 2019. The cartel may now be operating \"with a more horizontal leadership structure than previously thought.\"Tijuana/Arellano Felix Cartel - Based in Tijuana. Most of the Arellano Felix brothers have been apprehended or killed. May be regaining power due to an alignment with CJNG.TimelineDecember 11, 2006 - Newly elected Mexican President Calderon deploys more than 6,500 Mexican soldiers to the state of Michoac\u00e1n to battle drug traffickers. 2006 - In the first few weeks of the government crackdown on drug trafficking, 62 people are killed.

        "content": "(CNN)The Chicago Police Department is lowering hiring standards for new recruits by dropping the college credit requirement for some candidates, as the agency like others in the country continues to face Covid-related staffing shortages and national and local reckoning that's driven potential new police officers away from the profession.Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown announced last week that the department would waive a college-credit requirement for recruits who have two years of military or peace officer experience, or three years in corrections, social services, health care, trades, or education. Under the old policy, those candidates were required to have 60 hours of college credits.  Chicago police officers won't be charged in shootings of Adam Toledo and Anthony AlvarezAbout 3,800 people took the Chicago police department's entrance exam over the four months it was offered last year, compared to as many as 22,000 in recent years. At least two other big-city police departments have made similar moves in recent years. Philadelphia used to require some college for officers, but changed that policy to help ease a staffing shortage. That city's former commissioner called the lowering of standards an \"embarrassment.\" New Orleans police also jettisoned a 60-hour requirement, and the education requirement for new recruits is a GED or high school diploma. That move was also in response to staffing shortages.   During a news conference this week, New York City Mayor Eric Adams applauded Chicago's recruitment practices after a trip to the city to meet with Mayor Lori Lightfoot.Read More\"We're hearing all over the country that there is a requirement problem with police officers,\" he said. \"There were historical barriers that were preventing people from using life experiences to have waivers.\"\"We're going to look to duplicate that in New York City and so in the brief conversation I had, I know that this is an entry way to learn from each other,\" he added. \"We want to look at best practices of how do we finally turn the generational problem of crime in our cities.\"\"I think this is all about enlarging the pool of applicants you can choose from,\" said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum. \"Some cities are really strapped for candidates, so they have to take a second look, 'What do we have to do to expand the applicant pool?' And also, how do you make sure the candidate pool reflects the community you're serving.\"There's a broader trend of relaxing standardsPolice departments across the country are struggling to maintain their workforces, according to recent survey data compiled by the Police Executive Research Forum. According to their findings, collected from about 180 police departments of various sizes: \u2022 There were 42.7% more resignations in 2021 than in 2019.\u2022 Agencies of all sizes reported substantial increases in resignations from 2019 to 2021.  \u2022 There were 23.6% more retirements in 2021 than in 2019.\u2022 Agencies of all sizes reported an increase in retirements from 2019 to 2020, and large agencies saw the largest increase. NYPD top cop pick highlights the slow rise of female police chiefs nationwide\"The job has become much more demanding, complicated, sophisticated in terms of technology, in terms of writing, all of the tools -- judgment, decision making -- all of the things we expect that translates into police officers of future,\" Wexler said. \"If you want to change American police culture, you need to hire the best and the brightest. I'm not sure that's where we are today given what we're seeing.\" Wexler said that not everyone who's gone to college goes on to become a good police officer -- \"I know some people who've gone to college and they're complete idiots, absolutely no common sense\" -- and there's value in hiring older candidates with life experience who've been in the workforce or couldn't go to school because they're raising a family. But broadly, dropping the education requirement is \"worrisome,\" he said. \"We do know a more educated workforce is, you're getting a candidate pool (that) recognizes importance of education.\" The Chicago move is part of a broader trend of relaxing standards to entice more people into becoming police officers. Relaxing standards could mean allowing tattoos or prior use of marijuana. \"But also looking at things, like, how do you attract a larger base of candidates to choose from. If you talk to any chief today, they will tell you they're just not seeing the same number of people they've seen in years,\" Wexler said. Life experience makes 'a very big difference'In Chicago, about 3,800 people took the police department's entry exam over the four months it was offered in 2021. As many as 22,000 took the exam in 2018, about 14,000 applicants in 2016, and about 19,000 applicants in 2013. The Chicago Police Department's attrition rate more than doubled from 4% in 2020 to 8.5% in 2021, according to Brown. Chicago police declined to comment on how many people took recent entrance exams, or were hired from those exams, but called the pool of candidates \"very small.\" \"The 60 hours of college credit requirement can be prohibitive,\" Brown said last week at a news conference. A deputy chief, at the same news conference, said that \"life experience really does make a very big difference.\" Homicides in 22 US cities continue to rise in 2021 but at a slower pace, report saysBrown said the restrictions on recruit class sizes early in the pandemic to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 had an impact on the overall attrition rate, as well as an outbreak of Covid-19 in the summer of 2020 that prompted a shutdown of the police academy.Chicago's most recent recruit class in February was 48% female, 65% Hispanic, Brown said. The racial and ethnic makeup of the department in its entirety includes 20% African American, 4% Asian, 45% White, 30% Hispanic and \"various other categories of diversity\" that account for 1% of officers, he added. The city, as of the most recent census, is 33% White, 29.2% Black, and 28.6% Hispanic or Latino. That changed slightly from 10 years earlier, when the city's Black population was larger. Migdalia Bulnes, deputy chief of the newly created recruiting team for the agency, said that their goal was to open the pool of applicants to people who have work experience but were not able to attend college to obtain the 60 credit hours required for the job.\"There are many, many people just like that in our communities,\" she said. \"They are leaders, they have a job, they have experience, they have communication, they're making decisions, they're filling out reports. So those were the individuals that we thought of when we started talking about this program and exactly what we wanted to see come into this police department.\"CNN's Sam Romano, Priya Krishnakumar and Laura Studley contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)The Russian invasion of Ukraine, not surprisingly, remains the top news story this week. That will likely be the case as long as the war and the devastation continue. Still, there are stories on the domestic front that have also been making waves, both from a statistical angle and for their political implications.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis positions himself for 2024 run against Donald TrumpIf we've learned anything from the last two presidential cycles, it's that free media is worth a lot in presidential primaries. Trump got a historic amount of free media attention in 2016, and now-President Joe Biden led the pack for free media on the Democratic side during the 2020 primary season. DeSantis seems like he's the next major \"free media\" beneficiary. One of the few non-Ukraine news stories to break through in the last few weeks was the outcry over the new Florida legislation that critics have dubbed \"Don't Say Gay.\" (My colleague Zach Wolf has a strong article on what is actually in the bill and what it means.) Read MoreIndeed, DeSantis is continuing to lap other potential non-Trump 2024 candidates in Fox cable mentions. In about the last six months, \"DeSantis\" has been mentioned 920 to 950 times (depending on the day you start counting from), per the Internet Archive's Television News Archive. \"[Mike] Pence\" and \"[Ted] Cruz\" have been mentioned about 900 times -- combined.The same was true nearly a year ago when I wrote \"How the numbers show Ron DeSantis' stock is rising.\" It doesn't hurt DeSantis that the bill that recently passed in Florida is popular among Republicans, both in-state and nationally, and that he is a strong favorite for reelection as governor this year.The idea behind my piece in 2021 was that DeSantis should be considered a Republican front-runner for 2024, if Trump decided not to run. At this point, I think we can replace \"a\" with \"the\" in that last sentence. To be sure, Trump is the favorite for the GOP nomination in 2024 if he runs, but DeSantis is clearly the next most likely nominee. The Florida governor is second in pretty much every national 2024 GOP primary poll that includes Trump as an option. He's also the only other Republican to almost always crack double digits in these polls. When Trump is not included, DeSantis has the advantage in nearly every survey, usually polling in the mid-20s. That's quite similar to where Biden was in early 2020 Democratic primary polls. It's an enviable, though not infallible, position.   DeSantis is polling this well despite not being as well known to voters as Trump and Biden. Nearly 40% of Republicans had no opinion of DeSantis, a January Marquette University Law School poll found.But while Trump had a higher favorability rating among Republicans than DeSantis (74% versus 52%), DeSantis' favorability rating among Republicans who were knowledgeable enough to have an opinion was higher than Trump's (about 83% to about 75%). Indeed, the governor is in a much stronger position in the one place where voters know both DeSantis and Trump well -- Florida. DeSantis and Trump are within single digits of each other in an average of polls for a hypothetical 2024 primary in the Sunshine State. Trump calls Florida home now, and he easily won the 2016 Republican primary there over home-state Sen. Marco Rubio. We'll have to see what happens once Republicans nationwide know DeSantis as well as Republicans in Florida do. Violent crime continues to rise in major cities Another story that garnered major headlines this week was about a man who senselessly shot homeless people in New York and Washington, DC. While a suspect is under arrest, the fact is that crime continues to be an issue in American cities.Violent crime rose during the coronavirus pandemic in many American cities. Although we don't know exactly why, it's notable that this increase happened just when daily life was interrupted. This year, the pandemic has been less of an issue, but rates of violent crime still seem to be rising in the biggest American cities. In New York, the number of complaints for violent crime is up 27% from this point last year. In Los Angeles, it's up 5% from this time last year. And in Chicago, complaints of violent crime are up 9% from last year. All three cities have seen similar (in the case of Los Angeles) or larger (45% in New York and 34% in Chicago) increases in their overall crime rates within the past year. The good news from the stats is that the murder (or homicide) rate does seem to be down in all three cities. Unfortunately, the murder rate tells only part of the story.The higher crime rate in these cities is getting people's attention. A record percentage of New York City voters (74%) said crime was a very serious problem, according to a recent Quinnipiac University poll. It ranked as the top issue facing the city, the poll found. In Washington, (where violent crime is up 20% and overall crime is up 9% from this point last year), 36% of residents said the No. 1 problem facing the city that they wanted the mayor to solve was crime, violence or guns, per a recent Washington Post poll. No other issue mentioned by DC residents as the biggest problem got more than 14% in the survey.We'll see if this eventually translates into crime becoming a bigger national story. As I pointed out in January, it hasn't yet. For your brief encounters: No one wants to hear about your NCAA bracketOn the lighter side of the news, you may be watching or about to watch an NCAA basketball tournament game. If you have any interest in the topic, I'd suggest you check out my piece on the tournament, how much work productivity is lost during March Madness and the chances of Duke losing. One thing I will point out is that only about 15% of Americans even fill out college basketball brackets every year. Given that low percentage, I can assure you that no one really wants to hear how good or bad you're doing at predicting results. Question of the week: Are you more excited for the NCAA tournament or for the start of Major League Baseball in April? Tell us about it here, and we'll report the results next week. Last week's results: I asked you all last week to give us your thoughts on changing the clocks for daylight saving time. Most of you were in favor of making daylight saving time permanent. For instance, Chris Peterson tweeted, \"Daylight Saving time all year, but time zones should shift east by several hundred miles to ensure sunrise times in winter are within a reasonable window.\" A vocal minority were in favor of keeping standard time all year round. \"It's the natural time, defined by the sun and longitude. Why fight nature instead of working with it?\" tweeted Kristen Tullo. And Mark Pritchard came in with this novel idea: \"What we need is Weekend Savings Time. Clocks move forward one hour every Friday at 4 pm: suddenly it's 5 pm and the weekend! Clocks move back every Sunday night: now you have an extra hour of sleep before Monday.\"Little did I know then that the US Senate would hear your calls and vote by unanimous consent to make daylight saving time a year-round affair. We'll see what the House and Biden do about it.  Leftover pollsSleep problems: Having trouble sleeping? If so, you're not alone. A mere 32% of American adults said they had slept excellent or very good the previous night, according to a new Gallup poll. That compares with 33% who reported \"fair\" or \"poor\" sleep. (The rest said \"good.\") More Americans under age 50 (38%) said they had slept fairly or poorly than those 65 and older (24%). Masks at work: Just 39% of American workers said their workplaces had mask mandates last week, per an Axios/Ipsos poll. At no other time since the question was first asked in August 2021 had that percentage fallen below a majority. This comes as Covid-19 rates are rising in Europe and signs emerge of the potential for similar spikes in parts of the US. French presidential election: Last week, I noted that Biden seemed to be benefiting from a bit of a \"rally around the flag\" effect following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. One politician who is definitely receiving a bounce in his ratings is French President Emmanuel Macron. He faces reelection in about three weeks, and polls now show him over 30% in the first round, well ahead of the competition. As long as he finishes in the top two ahead of a likely runoff, Macron will be a heavy favorite for a second term.",

Morad Tahbaz, who is also a US citizen, spent 48 hours \"under house arrest\" with an ankle bracelet before being taken back to prison, according to his lawyer Hojjat Kermani. Fellow British-Iranian nationals Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori were released Wednesday and flew back to their homes in England. Tahbaz, an environmentalist who was first detained in January 2018, was released from Evin prison \"on furlough to his house in Tehran,\" UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in a statement on Wednesday.

(CNN)A mega moon rocket and the Orion spacecraft have finally emerged from their chrysalis and are towering in place at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.The most powerful rocket NASA has ever built, the Space Launch System is now ready for a final prelaunch test for the uncrewed Artemis I mission. Known as a wet dress rehearsal, the trial includes loading the fuel tanks and conducting a launch countdown.Ultimately, the plan is to use the 322-foot (98-meter) rocket to land the first woman and person of color on the moon. The SLS will usher in a new era of deep space exploration.But even as NASA reaches for the stars, I was struck this week by how much of Earth's surface still remains uncharted and how dramatically it can change without us knowing.

Marine scientists have discovered deep sinkholes -- one larger than a city block of six-story buildings -- and ice-filled hills that have formed \"extraordinarily\" rapidly on a remote part of the Arctic seafloor.Mapping of Canada's Beaufort Sea revealed the dramatic changes, which the researchers said are taking place as a result of thawing permafrost submerged underneath the seabed.It's the first time subsea permafrost has been tracked in this way, and scientists said it was surprising to see changes like these occurring in such a short span of time -- less than a decade. Permafrost is a frozen layer of earth, and it covers a quarter of the Northern Hemisphere, including under the sea. Large swaths of permafrost were submerged as glaciers melted and sea levels rose at the end of the last ice age, around 12,000 years ago.On land, warmer temperatures have led to radical shifts in the Arctic landscape in recent years. Human-caused climate change, however, didn't induce these shifts in the seabed, the researchers said.Wild kingdom When a pack of giant hornets attacks a honeybee hive, the slaughter is brutal and quick. The marauders -- sometimes described as murder hornets -- can decimate a hive in hours. While Asian bees have adapted to protect themselves from the predatory hornets, North American bees have not. Researchers in China have found a way to lure the hornets into traps -- potentially stopping the spread of the invasive species. Their secret weapon might surprise you. Hint: It involves the game of attraction.Consequences Pollen seasons are increasing in length and intensity.Allergies are far more than a sneezy seasonal annoyance -- hay fever can be super disruptive to everyday life. It's also a problem that's being exacerbated by the climate crisis.By the end of the century, the pollen season could begin as much as 40 days earlier than it has in recent decades in the US because of climate crises, according to new research. Annual pollen counts could climb by up to 250%.Typically, different trees such as birch, oak and pine release pollen at different times. But warmer and earlier spring weather means that different pollen varieties will overlap, making the pollen season more intense. DiscoveriesEwww.

A sponge's spatial partitioning -- the way it's divided into different sectors of various sizes -- means it's a paradise for bacteria that thrive in secluded spaces, according to a new study.

        "content": "(CNN)On February 12, 2020, Jacque Hollander sat in a conference room on the third floor of an Atlanta courthouse and told prosecutors she thought James Brown had been murdered.District Attorney Paul Howard listened, took notes, and accepted a green plastic bin full of items that Hollander said were corroborating evidence. The DA said his investigators would look into her claims about Brown's death.But it seems not much was done, according to a CNN review of internal documents released in recent weeks. Potential evidence went untested. A key witness died without being interviewed. There is no indication that anyone tried to obtain Brown's medical records. And when the DA's office returned Hollander's property in a cardboard box in March 2022, she said all the most important items she'd handed over were missing, without explanation.The documents obtained by CNN make clear that in nearly two years and under two Fulton County district attorneys, prosecutors did very little to answer lingering questions about Brown's final minutes.\"They never did anything on this case,\" Hollander said. \"And that's ridiculous.\"Read MoreCurrent Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis succeeded Howard in 2021 and closed the inquiry without taking action. Her spokesperson, Deputy District Attorney Jeff DiSantis, did not respond to an interview request or a detailed list of questions.Hollander first called me in 2017 to allege that the Godfather of Soul had been murdered at an Atlanta hospital on Christmas Day in 2006. His official cause of death was a heart attack and fluid in the lungs, and his daughter Yamma Brown declined to have an autopsy done. But I found a dozen other people who knew Brown and said they wanted an autopsy or a criminal investigation. Those people included Marvin Crawford, the doctor who signed Brown's death certificate and later told me he was \"highly suspicious that somebody perhaps could have given him an illicit substance that led to his death\"; and Andre White, a longtime friend of Brown who said he kept a vial of Brown's blood from the hospital in the hope of proving that Brown had been murdered. Jacque Hollander worked as a singer for the Carson & Barnes Circus when she first called a CNN reporter in 2017.\"I would like to know,\" White said in a 2017 interview, \"who basically killed him?\" Early in 2020, about a year after CNN published my investigative series on Brown, Howard agreed to meet with Hollander. In that February 12 meeting, which I also attended and recorded, Hollander said prosecutors should interview the following people to learn more about the circumstances of Brown's death: Daryl Brown, a son of James Brown who said he wanted a criminal investigation into his father's death.  Dr. Marvin Crawford, the doctor who treated Brown in 2006 and later said he suspected that Brown had not died of natural causes. Candice Hurst, the green plastic bin's previous owner, a former backup singer and hairdresser for Brown who shared with Hollander what Hollander believed was a confession about Brown's death. (Hurst has denied any connection to Brown's death and said Hollander misinterpreted the conversation, during which Hurst said she had a \"vision\" of herself in Brown's hospital room the night he died. Hurst told CNN she was not at the hospital with Brown the night he died, and her daughter Kayla Cavazo corroborated Hurst's account in a separate interview.) Shana Quinones, a former employee of Brown's who claimed that Brown's personal manager Charles Bobbit told her that Hurst was at the hospital with Brown. Tony Wilson, an associate of Brown who contradicted Hurst's account of the night Brown died and said Hurst admitted to him she'd been at the hospital with Brown. Andre White, the friend who claimed to have the vial of Brown's blood from the hospital and hoped to have it tested by law enforcement.After Hollander told her story, the district attorney said he had a list of six people to interview. His investigators took the bin into evidence and gave her a property receipt. Video footage released by the DA's office shows two employees cataloguing numerous items and placing them into clear plastic evidence bags. Brown supplied lead vocals for \"Atlanta Will Be Rockin',\" a song Jacque Hollander wrote in the 1980s to celebrate the Atlanta Falcons. Hollander's property receipt said, \"Green Plastic Storage Bin... Bin contains various items of clothing, hair rollers, combs, shoes, etc... (Due to the nature of what is 'said to be contained within the bin' , we did not conduct an inventory; so as not to contaminate the 3rd floor Grand Jury Room)... An inventory will be conducted as soon as practical...\"\"Within a period of six months,\" Howard told Hollander, \"we will see whether or not we can talk to the people that you've described. If at the end of that period, we are not able to substantiate what you've brought to us, we will then call you and return the items to you.\" Despite the pandemic, a prosecutor vows the investigation will continue In the months after he agreed to examine Brown's death, the district attorney faced one crisis after another.It wasn't just the Covid-19 pandemic. In May 2020, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Howard was under criminal investigation for the alleged misuse of public funds. (Howard paid $6,500 to settle a case with the state ethics commission but predicted he would be \"totally exonerated.\" A spokesperson for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said the case has been turned over to the Georgia Attorney General.) In June, Howard was accused of rushing to charge a police officer in the death of Rayshard Brooks before the investigation was complete. Howard responded that he was \"just doing his job.\"In early 2020, Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard agreed to look into Jacque Hollander's claims about James Brown's death. Later that year, Howard lost his bid for re-election to challenger Fani Willis.As the pandemic continued, Jacque Hollander wondered what would become of the James Brown inquiry. But on July 7, 2020, according to documents obtained by CNN through the Georgia Open Records Act, she got some reassurance.In a note written that day, Assistant District Attorney Michael Sprinkel apologized for being out of touch. He said the pandemic had hampered grand jury proceedings and in-person interviews. He told her not to worry about \"various statements made by various persons to various news outlets.\" He wrote, \"these statements did not dissuade me from pursuing this investigation.\" \"Lastly,\" Sprinkel wrote to Hollander, \"I expect that in the coming weeks and months, we will learn to co-exist with this virus. So this investigation will continue.\" Sprinkel sent a copy of the note to Chris Hopper, the spokesman for the DA's office. Nine minutes later, he emailed Hopper again: \"I'm on the phone with her right now, too.\"Hollander spent almost four hours on the phone with the assistant district attorney that day, she later told me. She said he wanted to begin issuing subpoenas and applying for search warrants. Hollander and Sprinkel spoke again the next day. She told me Sprinkel told her he would soon be seeking indictments.Sprinkel did not respond to a detailed list of questions I sent for this story, including questions about what he told Hollander.Did Hollander understand correctly? Was an indictment on the horizon? A recording of the call would help answer these questions. Sprinkel sometimes records calls with potential witnesses. I know this because a brief recording of Sprinkel's call to someone else was included in the documents I received from the DA's office. I requested a copy of Sprinkel's call with Hollander, but the DA's legal counsel, Don Geary, told me that no such recording exists.On August 11, 2020, about a month after Sprinkel's long call with Hollander, DA Paul Howard lost a runoff election by a nearly 3-to-1 margin to Fani Willis, his former employee, which meant his term would expire by the end of the year.Two days later, Jacque Hollander said she received a phone call from Candice Hurst. Hollander said it sounded as if Hurst knew something that Hollander didn't know. (I tried to reach Hurst by phone for this story, but my calls were not returned.) Hurst also texted Hollander several pictures of herself in skimpy clothing and suggestive poses. Hollander informed Sprinkel about the call and the text messages and offered to forward them to Sprinkel.Candice Hurst, former hairdresser for James Brown, at CNN Center in 2017.  \"Yes, please send them,\" Sprinkel texted Hollander on August 14. \"Why on earth is she doing this? Is it because of the election? Like I said, it's not like a forthcoming changing of the guard magically makes the case disappear from the consideration of the Fulton County D.A.'s Office.\"The DA's office released the text message chain between Sprinkel and Hollander in response to CNN's open-records request.\"She has no reason to believe [that the investigation is closed] other than the recent election results, which aren't nearly as relevant to the investigation as she believes,\" Sprinkel wrote to Hollander, referring to Hurst. \"So don't worry about it -- the investigation continues...\"Two days later, Hollander texted Sprinkel to ask why he hadn't called her back.\"I'm sorry about these issues with Candice, and no, I haven't walked away - I would absolutely tell you if we ended the investigation,\" Sprinkel wrote on August 24. \"Right now, however, my Supervisor, Adam Abbate (he was in the meeting with Thomas earlier this year), has ordered me to attend to the recent influx of homicides in Atlanta. Basically he wants me to get these cases ready for Grand Jury presentment whenever the court re-opens. So special investigations, such as this, will be addressed on the resumption of normal operations. This isn't too much of a deviation from where I was previously - my investigatory powers are greatly reduced without a sitting Grand Jury to which I may Subpoena witnesses.\"Something appeared to change after that. From August to the following January, according to the text chain released by the DA's office, Hollander wrote to Sprinkel more than 40 times. But Sprinkel never replied again.Fulton County Assistant District Attorney Michael Sprinkel testifies at a trial in March  2018 in Atlanta. Meanwhile, the situation kept getting worse for Sprinkel's boss. In September, Howard's spokesman confirmed that Howard had received a federal grand jury subpoena for records related to his compensation. (Howard denied wrongdoing; the Justice Department did not respond to a request for information on the case.)I tried to assess the situation. Would Sprinkel lose his job when the new DA took over? Where would that leave the James Brown matter? Hoping to gain some insight, I wrote a note and mailed it to Sprinkel's home address. He did not reply.When I reached Howard by phone in August 2021, after he'd left the DA's office and gone into private law practice, he did not sound like the same man who met with Hollander the previous year.\"I just don't recall,\" Howard said when I asked what became of the Brown investigation. \"I have to say James Brown is not within the scope of my memory or consciousness.\" A new DA takes over, and the case takes a perplexing turn District Attorney Fani Willis took office on January 1, 2021. She kept Michael Sprinkel on her staff of prosecutors. And she inherited the James Brown matter, which the previous DA had left unresolved. On January 26, Jacque Hollander called to ask about the case and the green plastic bin she'd left in Howard's care. She was transferred to Chief of Investigations Capers Green, who emailed Sprinkel just before noon:  Please contact Ms. Jacque Hollander about the status of the case on the Death of Mr. James Brown.She explained that she spoke to you and Paul Howard about James Brown being murdered and she wants to know what happen to the evidence that she brought you.Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis took office in 2021. She is best known her office's ongoing   investigation into whether former President Donald Trump and others committed crimes by pressuring Georgia officials to overturn Joe Biden's 2020 presidential election victory.A long email chain ensued, during which an investigator said the bin was still in an evidence room. Eventually Sprinkel gave several high-ranking colleagues a summary of the case.He did not mention Marvin Crawford, the doctor who treated Brown and said he was \"highly suspicious that somebody perhaps could have given him an illicit substance that led to his death.\" He did not mention that Hollander had given him 1,256 pages of text messages from her iPhone. He did not tell his colleagues that the green plastic bin contained the \"James Brown duffle bag\" that Hurst referred to in one of the text messages on Hollander's phone, or that Hurst wrote it contained \"the dope he was doing the last week of his life,\" or that she wrote, \"Everything will look so wrong.\"Instead, Sprinkel wrote that after he'd spoken with Hollander for \"probably 10+ hours,\" he didn't have \"reasonable suspicion that a crime occurred.\" He continued: \"This will make getting James Brown's medical records difficult because we don't have P.C. (probable cause) for a search warrant, and we can't even get them with a Subpoena (not that the hospital would likely honor one if we tried). This is because I can't articulate a crime to form the basis of a theoretical indictment, which must necessarily back the Subpoena.\"Building a criminal case in Brown's death would be difficult given the passage of time, the death certificate that cited natural causes, and questions about chain of custody with regard to potential evidence. In 2020, Tom Ruocco, then-chairman of the police investigative operations committee at the International Association of Chiefs of Police, spoke with me after reading CNN's story on Brown's death. Ruocco said, \"Somebody's going to have to find that piece that's going to blow open this whole thing.\"By early 2021, such a breakthrough seemed unlikely. In his email to colleagues on January 26, Sprinkel wrote that after he received the letter I mailed to his home, \"I reached out to our P.R. guy at that time and was told not to respond to the reporter and because of this case getting media attention, to not do anything until further notice. So I've put the case on the back burner for the time being.\"Here was a potential explanation for Sprinkel's sudden unresponsiveness to Jacque Hollander. But I've never heard of a media spokesman with the power to tell a prosecutor to stop investigating a case. Nor is it plausible that an investigation would shut down because of media attention; if so, no high-profile case would ever be resolved.I asked Sprinkel and the DA's office for the name of \"P.R. guy\" mentioned in Sprinkel's email, but I've gotten no response. I also called and emailed a spokesman who worked for Paul Howard at that time to ask for his recollections on this episode, but I have not heard back.Dr. Marvin Crawford treated James Brown during his last hospital stay in 2006 and later said he was \"highly suspicious that somebody perhaps could have given him an illicit substance that led to his death.\" Even after Sprinkel sent the email saying he didn't have reasonable suspicion, others in the DA's office showed potential interest in the case. Deputy Chief Investigator Michael Green sent an email in February 2021 asking Sprinkel to type his handwritten notes from the 2020 meeting between Howard and Hollander and send them along. Sprinkel complied.It's not clear what Green did with the information. The batch of emails I received from the DA's office includes nothing from the ensuing three months.Potential evidence goes missingIn May 2021, Jacque Hollander told me yet another odd story: For the second time in about nine months, someone close to Brown had called to taunt her.This time, she said, it was a series of phone calls from a mysterious man known as Ghost. He also goes by Christian St. John, Van St. John, and Christian Van St. John, among other names. In 2018, a police detective in metro Atlanta tried and failed to discover his true identity. Ghost has called me several times as well. He claims to be related to James Brown. In 2016, he sent Hollander a text message that indicated he knew something about Brown's death. He asked her about \"the lace poisoning\" that was \"used to poison him.\"Jacque Hollander walks behind the Carson & Barnes circus tent after performing. \"There is something very wrong here,\" she told CNN about the missing items in the evidence bags.Hollander said Ghost called her again on May 25, 2021. The calls were disturbing enough that she filed a report with her local police department. She says he told her, \"You and Lake are f---ing liars and you're going to burn in hell,\" and \"the district attorney is doing nothing, because she knows you're both pieces of s---.\"Two days later, there was a brief flurry of activity at the DA's office. Deputy Chief Operating Officer Dexter Q. Bond Jr. emailed Sprinkel with the subject line \"James Brown Case\" and asked whether or not there was a police report. Sprinkel wrote back, \"Are you referring to the James Brown that was a famous musical artist?\" About an hour later, Sprinkel forwarded the email chain from January \u2014 which included his summary of the case \u2014 to four other colleagues, including Executive District Attorney George Jenkins, who replied, \"Thanks Mike for the update...\"What investigators did next is unknown. Some requested emails were missing from the trove of documents the DA's office gave me. Geary provided no emails from District Attorney Fani Willis, even though I emailed her about the case in March 2021 and a copy of that email should have appeared in the search.On October 11, 2021, Sprinkel submitted a memo on the case. I don't know what it said. According to Geary, the memo contains confidential legal conclusions that are not subject to the Georgia Open Records Act.But that Sprinkel memo was cited in another memo I did receive. This one was dated October 28. Deputy District Attorney Adriane Love wrote to DA Fani Willis, \"My review of the facts of and basis for the inquiry, and of the memorandum of Chief Sr. ADA Sprinkel, has led me to conclude that there is an insufficient basis for the initiation of a Grand Jury investigation into the death of Mr. Brown.\"According to Geary, the district attorney accepted Love's recommendation to close the case.Now, two years after Jacque Hollander visited District Attorney Paul Howard, she does not have the green plastic bin. She said she made repeated inquiries to the DA's office, but no one would tell her where it was. Her attorney, Bryan Ward, shared with me an email he sent to Sprinkel on February 16 asking for the return of her property. On March 10, Ward got an email from William Chris Clark, assistant chief of evidence for the DA's office.\"We have shipped the items requested,\" Clark wrote in the email, which Hollander shared with me.Jacque Hollander handed over this bag of items to the Fulton DA's office in 2020 as potential evidence in James Brown's death. When the DA's office sent it back to her in March 2022, she says, it was empty. No one has explained what happened to the missing items.Hollander received a cardboard box via FedEx on Monday morning. It weighed 14.65 pounds, according to the FedEx shipping receipt, considerably less than the green plastic bin weighed when Hollander turned it in two years earlier, and the box was smaller than the green plastic bin. I spoke with Hollander after she opened the box. She said many of the items listed on her receipt from the DA's office \u2014 including hair rollers, a black stiletto shoe, and clothing \u2014 were missing. So were other items not listed on the receipt, including a handwritten note.Hollander told me that most of what she received in 2022 were old newspaper articles that had something to do with James Brown. It appears the DA's office did not send her any of the items that officials had put in evidence bags two years earlier.Even stranger, she said, the box contained two older mobile phones that she did not remember seeing in the green plastic bin when she turned it in. The phones' batteries had been removed, she said, but they had small red lights that were glowing red.\"There is something very wrong here,\" Hollander said.There was no inventory letter from the DA's office or any explanation for the missing items. I made inquiries with spokesman Jeff DiSantis but did not get a reply. I filed an open-records request for all documents related to the chain of custody for Hollander's items at the DA's office, but legal counsel Don Geary said no such documents existed beyond the original property receipt.\"Don't employees from the DA's office have to sign a log when they handle evidence?\" I wrote back in an email to Geary. \"Isn't there a system for keeping evidence secure?\"\"One would expect,\" Geary replied, \"however, there are no other documents concerning the property.\"A witness dies, taking his secrets with himNothing in the case file released to me gives any indication that investigators tried to contact even one of the six people Howard told Hollander they would interview. The documents make no mention of any contact with Daryl Brown, Dr. Marvin Crawford, Candice Hurst, Shana Quinones or Tony Wilson. They do make an indirect reference to Andre White, the friend who said Brown was murdered.White was alive in February 2020, when the inquiry began. I missed a call from him in March of that year, as the pandemic intensified. When I called back, he sounded ill and said he'd called me by accident. Later I found out he was in the hospital that day, March 27, along with his wife, Joyce. They were two of Georgia's early victims of the coronavirus. His wife died April 2.  Andre White, a former pro football player and close friend of James Brown, died in 2020, about three years after telling a CNN reporter he had a vial of Brown's blood.Mr. White recovered enough to come home, his daughter Racquel later told me, although he was too weak to stand on his own. \"Then all of a sudden he couldn't breathe,\" she said. When I think of Andre White now, I remember something he told me in 2017: \"I'm gonna fight 'til I die trying to find out what happened.\"White died on June 9, 2020, about four months after the DA pledged to look into James Brown's death. His daughter told me that as far as she knew, no one from law enforcement had spoken with him. When I asked what happened to the vial of blood he claimed to have kept, she said, \"Honestly, I don't know.\"At his memorial service, his friend Barbara Mobley, a former Georgia state representative, said this about White: \"By the way, Andre, a close friend of James Brown, never ever accepted the official cause of death reported for James Brown. Not for a second. And seemed pleased when early this year, there was a media report of a re-investigation into Brown's cause of death.\"Jacque Hollander told me she sent Sprinkel a link to a Facebook video of White's memorial service. Their text-message chain confirms this. Which is why it was surprising to read what Sprinkel wrote in an email to colleagues in January 2021, almost a year after the inquiry began and seven months after Andre White's death. \"Perhaps someone can knock on the door of the guy that is believed to have the vial of blood,\" Sprinkel wrote, \"and ask him if he still has it.\"The DA's office closed the file about nine months later, leaving many questions unanswered. Why did Sprinkel seem so interested in July 2020 and so much less interested shortly thereafter? Why didn't he talk to the other people? What happened to the green plastic bin and the items that were in the evidence room? And what really happened to James Brown in the hospital?In 2017, I sat in Andre White's car as he considered this last question. His voice was breaking, and tears came to his eyes. \"How certain are you that someone did kill him?\" I asked. \"Just as sure as you're sittin' in the car,\" he said. In the ongoing story of James Brown's life and death, one mystery always leads to another. I remember another thing White said in the car that summer morning.\"It's just certain things that I have to take to my grave,\" White said.Four years later, he did.",

The cannabis-infused gummies are called \"Mike Bites\" in homage to Tyson's most notorious moment.Holyfield, the only four-time world heavyweight champion, defeated Tyson at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas in 1996. The following year, during their highly anticipated rematch, Tyson bit off a small section of Holyfield's ear, spit it onto the canvas and was promptly disqualified. The gory incident marked the rematch as one of the most bizarre fights in the history of boxing.Tyson, who was the youngest boxer ever to win a heavyweight title, has launched several cannabis-related ventures in recent years. Tyson 2.0, the company releasing \"Mike Bites,\" describes itself as \"a premier cannabis company formed with legendary boxer, entrepreneur and icon Mike Tyson.\" In 2021, the company expanded its sales to over 100 locations in California.On Twitter, Tyson himself vouched that \"These ears actually taste good!\"Holy ears! They're finally here! Go get your Mike Bites now \ud83d\udc42\ud83d\ude24 pic.twitter.com/BCbXcdYcra\u2014 ItsTyson20 (@itstyson20) March 15, 2022\n\nRead MoreTyson is part of a wave of celebrities who have launched their own cannabis-related products and brands. In 2015, rapper Snoop Dogg debuted \"Leafs by Snoop,\" a branded line of cannabis products. Similarly, in 2019, hip-hop artist Drake announced that he was going into business with a Canadian cannabis firm. Joining the trend, Martha Stewart launched her own line of CBD-infused dog treats in 2021, and Jaleel White released a strain of -- wait for it -- Purple Urkel cannabis.Tyson hasn't been shy about his strong relationship with cannabis. The former heavyweight champion admitted in 2019 that he spends $40,000 a month on weed at his 40-acre cannabis ranch. Tyson opened the farm in 2018 after California legalized recreational marijuana. Tyson 2.0's website explains that \"When Mike was in his prime, he used cannabis to relax his body and focus his mind.\"Tyson and Holyfield have reconciled since the infamous \"Bite Fight.\" The two appeared in a humorous Foot Locker ad together and in 2014, Tyson delivered the speech for Holyfield's induction into the Nevada Boxing Hall of Fame.",

        "content": "(CNN)The bridgetender controlling a Florida drawbridge when a woman walking across fell to her death was arrested Thursday and charged with one count of manslaughter by culpable negligence, West Palm Beach police said in a release. Artissua Lafaye Paulk, 43, was on duty February 6 when 79-year-old Carol Wright fell to her death as she was walking her bike across the Royal Park Bridge over the Intercoastal Waterway when it opened.In Paulk's statement to police outlined in a probable cause affidavit, she described the measures she took to ensure that no one was on the bridge, including visually checking several times from the balcony, turning the traffic lights red, closing the pedestrian gate, and making announcements that the bridge was going to open. Paulk said she didn't see any people or bicycles inside the gates when she checked before opening the bridge. \"Based on the above investigation, video evidence contradicts Artissua Paulk's statement that she walked out onto the balcony and visually checked the bridge for vehicles or pedestrians prior to opening the bridge,\" a police officer says in the affidavit.  Read More\"Artissua Paulk's actions showed reckless disregard of human life and the safety of a person, specifically Carol Wright,\" the officer writes. Paulk was charged with one count of manslaughter by culpable negligence, police said in their release. CNN has reached out to Paulk's public defender for comment on the case. Investigators also found a discrepancy in Paulk's reporting of how many times the bridge opened that day, the affidavit said. Paulk told police she opened the gate five times, but when investigators reviewed the log, she had only noted four openings.Surveillance video showed the gate opened six times during her shift, according to the affidavit. The affidavit notes that when reviewing the surveillance video of the balcony, it does not show anyone coming out on it after 9:03 a.m. that day. \"The door does not open and there is no movement on the balcony at any other time during Paulk's shift on 2/6/22,\" it says. The affidavit states that during a forensic review of Paulk's phone, officers note that there were several incoming and outgoing messages between 12:52 p.m. (seven minutes before the bridge opening procedure began) and 4:26 p.m. (when she gave her statement to police,) including messages from the bridge supervisor. According to the affidavit, a message from the supervisor, that police say was deleted from Paulk's phone, said, \"When they talk to you make dam sure you tell them you walked outside on balcony 3 diff times to make sure no one was past gates n delete this msg after one time to make sure card stop 2nd time after gates lowered and 3rd time before you raised spans ok now delete this I know ur upset but u gotta tell them step by step how u do opening.\"  The court document says that a response to that message of \"I did\" from Paulk's phone was also deleted.  Wright family attorney Lance Ivey said in a statement the police investigation confirmed their long-standing position that Wright was lawfully on the bridge. Ivey also said Paulk didn't make a required announcement over an intercom that the bridge would be raised.\"Carol was there to be seen. The activation to raise the bridge resulted in a several minute mental and physical death sentence for Carol,\" he said. \"The thorough and intensive investigation conducted by the city of West Palm Beach Police Department gave Carol back her voice (to let truth prevail) that was unimaginably and prematurely taken from her on February 6th,\" Court records show Paulk has bonded out of the Polk County Jail.",

Executions there had been paused until the state was able to accommodate the firing squad option.In May 2021, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, signed a bill into law that made the electric chair the state's primary means of execution but allowed inmates the option to instead choose firing squad or lethal injection if available. The change was made to South Carolina law as states around the country hit barriers executing those on death row due to problems administering lethal injections, the widely preferred method in the US. Difficulties finding the required drugs have essentially put executions in many states on hold.The department on Friday detailed the room setup and protocols for how a firing squad execution would be carried out, noting that an inmate would be strapped into a chair with a hood placed over the person's head. A member of the execution team would place a small aim over the person's heart, according to the release. The rifles used by the three-member firing squad will not be visible to witnesses, the department said.Read MoreMembers of the firing squad must meet certain qualifications and are volunteer department employees, according to the release. The department spent about $53,600 to make the necessary changes to accommodate firing-squad executions.There are 35 men on death row in South Carolina, and the state last executed an inmate by lethal injection in 2011, according to the Department of Corrections website.",

The video, which includes different angles of the incident without sound, shows a fight begin between two students as an off-duty officer, working school security at the time, attempts to break it up before either being hit or falling backward with one of the students. It appears he hits his head on the edge of a nearby table. Shortly after, the officer is seen on top of the student and appears to push her head into the ground with one hand and then place his knee on her neck for about 25 seconds, appearing to apply the pressure of his body weight at some points.The 12-year-old girl is eventually handcuffed, picked up, and led away, the video shows. CNN is not naming the 12-year-old as she is a minor. The family's attorney, Drew DeVinney, said the officer's knee was on her neck for an \"unconscionable duration.\"Social media video released earlier appeared to show a fight between two students as the off-duty officer attempted to break it up before either being hit or falling backward. Shortly after, he is seen on top of the student.\"This was a cruel and heartless act of violence aimed at a child and is unacceptable in our society,\" the attorney said in a statement. Read MoreThe girl's father received the surveillance video Friday, is \"appalled by what he has seen,\" and is demanding the Kenosha Police Department \"immediately terminate\" this officer, the statement added. The officer was off-duty at the time and working part-time as a school security guard, but he has since resigned from his position with the school district. CNN reached out to the Kenosha Police Department inquiring about his status as a police officer but has not received a response. The department also did not respond when asked about the extent of any injuries the officer may have sustained as part of this incident.Off-duty officer resigns from school district role after being seen on video putting his knee on the neck of a 12-year-old to break up a fightPolice did confirm to CNN this week, however, that a criminal charge of disorderly conduct has been referred to the court system for \"both juveniles involved in the incident.\" The Kenosha County District Attorney's Office indicated there is generally a 40-day window before the facts of any juvenile case like this, if not settled beforehand, could make it to their office for any potential decision on a formal charge. \"There is no pretty arrest,\" Mac Hardy, Director of Operations for the National Association of School Resource Officers, told CNN Friday, but added, \"We are never trained to put our knee on the back of anyone's neck.\" \"I've never been aware of any training anywhere\" in regards to that, he said.Hardy also pointed to specific factors that would help determine the type of response used in a school fight circumstance like this, including the \"age and the size of the children\" involved. \"I would've liked to see more teachers and more school staff in that situation than that school security officer,\" he said, as he acknowledged being in school is \"different than what you get on the streets. Not every police officer is cut out to be an SRO (School Resource Officer).\" What school policy says about restraintIn regards to the restraint used, a school incident report provided by DeVinney, the girl's attorney, indicates there was \"pressure or weight on the student's neck or throat, or an artery, or that otherwise obstruct the student's circulation or breathing,\" and that the student was placed in a \"prone position.\" The report also says the restraint did not cause any chest compression and there was adequate care to protecting the student's head, despite a screenshot appearing to show the off-duty officer holding the student's head to the ground. Kenosha Unified School District policy says that physical restraint on a student would be permissible in certain circumstances, including when a student is presenting a \"clear, present and imminent risk\" to the safety of others and as long as it's not a prohibited maneuver or technique. But putting \"pressure or weight on the student's neck or throat, on an artery, or on the back of the student's head or neck, or that otherwise obstruct the student's circulation or breathing,\" is among those prohibited maneuvers or techniques, as is placing a student in a prone position \"chest down, back up.\" The internal employment investigation has concluded, Tanya Ruder, chief communications officer for the Kenosha Unified School District, told CNN Friday. Ruder added that, \"as it appears that this incident may lead to litigation, the district will provide no further details at this time.\" The Kenosha Professional Police Association had no official comment when reached by CNN.",

Oakland police have arrested Hale and Mitchell, and are asking for the public's help in finding Gilbert. The US Marshals are assisting.As recently as a couple of months ago, Gilbert was in police custody in connection with another case but was not charged, Armstrong said in a news conference.The Alameda County District Attorney has charged all three men with murder, attempted second degree robbery, and assault with a semi-automatic firearm. Mitchell was arraigned on Friday, according to the district attorney's office. He will be back in court on April 15 to enter a plea.Her murder stumped investigators for 34 years. Now, DNA evidence points to a neighbor as her killer, police sayRead MoreHale's arraignment has not been set. CNN has not been able to identify legal representation for either of the men arrested. The Alameda County Public Defender's Office told CNN no one there has been assigned to represent either of the men.After the shooting in November, Oakland police released a surveillance photo of a vehicle that had a sunroof but no front license place, which they believed was involved in the killing of Nishita. The police also offered a reward for information leading to an arrest in the case.Authorities had said at the time that the attack followed \"an extremely violent week\" when they said armed roving caravans inundated Oakland, targeting businesses.Tips from the public helped police identify the suspects' vehicle, which was outside Oakland's city limits, and the men allegedly involved.\"Even in other cities, community members brought forth information so we would know where to look,\" Armstrong said. \"Well, that was a tremendous help.\"\"Nothing brings back your loved one, but this is something that that people can feel some sense of justice as a result of this arrest,\" said Armstrong. \"We continue to wrap our arms around his family, and their law enforcement family continues to support them as well.\"CNN's Andy Rose, Melissa Alonso, Stella Chan and Chris Boyette contributed to this story.",

        "content": "(CNN)When Diane Lynn Dahn missed her shift at the San Diego Transit Corporation on May 2, 1988, a coworker went to her apartment to check on her. Her coworker discovered her lifeless body in her bedroom. Dahn's 2-year-old was wandering around the apartment complex.Dahn had been bludgeoned and stabbed, according to the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. Her cause of death was stab wounds to the chest and her death was ruled a homicide, investigators said. At the time, the San Diego County Sheriff's homicide unit conducted an extensive investigation, but the department came up short on identifying a suspect -- until now.Dahn's family, including Mark Beyer, her then 2-year-old son who has no recollection of the incident, spent 34 years wondering who murdered her and why, but thanks to investigative genetic genealogy, investigators were able to track down the suspect, Warren Robertson, a man who also lived in the same apartment complex as Dahn in 1988, according to investigators. Read MoreDecades of wondering what happenedBeyer was adopted by a family friend and said he saw his grandparents and biological family as often as he could.\"Looking back, some of the struggles you go through is you feel alone because of what you went through, you lost your mother,\" he told police. \"You know you have family, you know you have family who loves you, but sometimes you do feel alone all the time.\" Mark Beyer, who was 2-years-old when his mother was murdered. Family members who knew Dahn described her as a goofy, funny person who loved to draw -- qualities Beyer said, he too, has within him.Victoria Dahn-Minter, Dahn's sister, said not knowing what happened almost consumed her all these years. She described Dahn as an amazing person who played the violin and guitar. Las Vegas police use DNA testing and genealogical research to solve 42-year-old homicide of teen girl\"It's unfortunate my nephew never had the chance to know his mom,\" Dahn-Minter said during a police news conference. \"She was a great mother.\" In 1988, Robertson worked as local tow truck driver in San Diego, according to investigators, but after Dahn's murder, he left his family and moved about 20 miles away to Lakeside, California. A year later, Robertson moved to Indiana and lived there until he died at age 39, in a house fire on November 25, 1999, investigators said.Warren Robertson was Diane Lynn Dahn's neighbor inside the same apartment complex in San Diego, California in 1988.Cold Case detectives couldn't figure out the connection between Robertson and Dahn. They did, however, find that both were racing enthusiasts and attended stock car races at the El Cajon Speedway around the time of Dahn's murder. The crime scene outside of the apartment complex where both Robertson and Dahn lived on May 2, 1988.How investigative genetic genealogy helped track down the killerTraditionally, investigators will take DNA from a crime scene and compare it to a suspect's DNA or they enter the crime scene DNA into a national database, also known as CODIS, to see if there's a match with a known criminal offender. But if the person isn't a known offender, they won't be in the CODIS system and, therefore, no match would be present.In October 2000, a sample of DNA was taken from underneath Dahn's fingernails. Further testing was done in 2001, but the profile was \"insufficient to place into a federal database of DNA from unsolved crimes or CODIS,\" police said. Ten years later, investigators opened Dahn's case again, looking for new leads and use of new technology. A strand of hair that was found in Dahn's hand was processed, a profile in CODIS was created, but it didn't produce any leads even though it was consistent with the sample found underneath her fingernails.It started as a hobby. Now they're using DNA to help cops crack cold casesIn May 2020, investigators started using investigative genetic genealogy, which combines DNA evidence and traditional genealogy, to find biological connection between people.In this case, investigators were looking for relatives whose DNA matched those of the unidentified suspect in Dahn's murder. The suspect's profile was created and uploaded into commercial genealogy sites that allow law enforcement agencies to participate, police said. After what investigators called an exhaustive process, nine family trees were created with nearly 1,300 people connected to Robertson either through blood or marriage. Eventually, direct relatives of Robertson gave their DNA samples and confirmed his identification and matched the hair strand that was found in Dahn's hands.For over 60 years, the identity of a girl whose body was found in an Arizona desert has been a mystery. Now, 'Little Miss Nobody' has a nameThis is the fifth time the Sheriff's Homicide Unit has used investigative genetic genealogy to solve a cold case.Beyer said he was \"blown away\" when he heard how his mother's case had finally been solved.\"Like how you go from what little information you have to building a case like that was truly impressive,\" he said. \"The answers that my family received is closure and closure is everything even after so much time had passed.\"",

Her death led to public rallies and outpourings of anger from women who recounted their own experiences and fears of being out alone at night.Last week, the High Court in London ruled that police had acted unlawfully when they used Covid-19 rules to force campaigners to cancel an outdoor vigil for Everard, which ended with officers using heavy-handed tactics to arrest several women and provoked widespread condemnation.",

        "content": "(CNN)His victim begged for mercy, police say. But all Gerald Brevard allegedly did, according to court documents, was pull the trigger, then sit on a nearby curb. A surveillance camera picked up music playing.New details have emerged in court documents that describe the shooting spree in which Gerald Brevard allegedly preyed on five homeless men, killing one victim in Washington, DC, and another in New York City.Court records released by Superior Court of the District of Columbia on Wednesday show evidence investigators have gathered on Brevard.  Investigators from DC Metropolitan Police have multiple surveillance videos of the man they believe is Brevard at each shooting scene. The investigators from each agency also have cell phone data confirming his location and a tipster who led police to Brevard, according to the court document.What we know about the suspect in the New York and DC shootings of homeless menWhen contacted by CNN, Brevard's attorney declined to comment.Read MoreSurveillance recordings from H Street in Washington, DC, the sound of a gunshot, then a male voice saying \"no, no, no\" and \"please don't shoot\" just before 1:30 a.m. on March 8.A witness to the shooting told Metropolitan Police they saw Brevard allegedly fire one shot at the homeless victim, who was sitting in a lawn chair. The victim screamed and ran but Brevard followed, allegedly firing his weapon several more times, the witness told police.  When he was done shooting, surveillance footage caught audio of Brevard playing music from what appeared to be a mobile device, Metropolitan Police said, according to the court document. The homeless victim suffered gunshot wounds to his head, face, chest, thigh, buttock and hand, according to court records. The unknown victim survived and still has not spoken to investigators because of the nature of his injuries.Metropolitan Police believe this was Brevard's second shooting. The first is believed to have taken place on March 3 in Washington, DC, where Brevard allegedly shot another homeless person twice in the lower back and the victim suffered a graze wound to the arm, according to the court document. That victim survived, DC Metropolitan Police say. Then, on March 9, police responded to a fire on New York Avenue in Washington, DC just before 3 a.m., where they found a victim, Morgan Holmes, 54, dead with several burn injuries, according to the charging document. The DC Medical Examiner later determined Holmes suffered multiple stab wounds, at least two gunshot wounds along with burns to most of his body and ruled his death a homicide. New York City announces plan to increase safety, address homelessness in subway systemAfter canvassing the area for surveillance photos, Metropolitan Police spotted a man they say is Brevard in almost the same outfit as he wore in the previous shooting attacks: a black hood, a black face mask, a quilted black jacket, blue gloves, black pants and black sneakers with white markings on the toe and ankle area. He was holding a mobile device and a white cord, similar to those used for head phones.Multiple cameras caught the man investigators suspect is Brevard walking around the area where Holmes was found. After a few minutes, a man police believe was Brevard left and was seen on another camera at a nearby gas station trying to pump gas into a cup. The man police believe is Brevard was later seen back at the area where Holmes was found. After crouching down multiple times, the video shows a fire being lit, the court document shows. Brevard then allegedly traveled to New York, first shooting a sleeping homeless victim in the arm just after 4:30 a.m. on March 12 on a street in lower Manhattan. He survived and described his attacker to police.Later that day, the New York Police Department responded hours later to a homeless man who was found dead on Howard Street, less than a mile from where the first shooting took place, according to the court document. NYPD later determined, after analyzing the ballistic evidence and partnering with Washington DC's Metropolitan Police, that both homeless men had been shot by Brevard, the court record shows.After several photos of Brevard -- whose identity was not known at the time --  were released by law enforcement in New York and Washington, a tipster reached out to Metropolitan Police and said they recognized the man in the photo. A detective scrolled through social media. What he noticed helped catch a person wanted for shooting homeless men in 2 citiesAfter Metropolitan Police showed the tipster multiple photos of Brevard, the tipster gave them Brevard's Instagram handle, date of birth and phone number, according to the court document. That's when investigators saw a recent post from Brevard, showing him in some of the same clothing he had been wearing in surveillance footage from the shooting scenes, and another photo with the caption \"Feeling Devilish Feeling Godly,\" which was taken in DC.Investigators were also able to obtain Brevard's cell phone number from a \"social media provider\" and then use the cell phone provider to get his location during the previous days. Investigators saw the cell phone data that showed he had been in Washington, DC and in New York. It coincided with the incidents they were investigating, the court document said. Then, on March 15 at 2:30 a.m. investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives spotted Brevard and, after his brief attempt to run, he was taken into custody near Pennsylvania Avenue. Further microscopic testing was done on the shell casings that were found at the scene of each shooting, and it was determined that they all came from the same gun, according to the court document.",

        "content": "(CNN)A group of police officers in Montgomery County, Maryland, are being accused of repeatedly making hateful comments against people of color in a group text message chain -- including that they hoped Black Lives Matter protesters would die.  One of their colleagues, Mark Miles, filed a lawsuit this week claiming his supervisor at the Maryland-National Capital Park Police and other officers sent the text messages in a chain meant to discuss work assignments. They also \"mocked, demeaned, ostracized and humiliated\" him for being Black, according to the lawsuit.Miles' unit patrolled parks, primarily those in Montgomery County. The lawsuit, which was filed Monday in the US District Court for the District of Maryland, accuses the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission and Stephanie Harvey, his supervisor in her official capacity, of harassment, discrimination and retaliation.The agency manages parks and planning in Montgomery and Prince George's counties.LA public defender's office has 100 cases involving Torrance officers accused of racist and anti-Semitic textsRead MoreWhen Miles, who joined the park police in 2019, started working in Harvey's unit in 2020, he realized it was \"common practice\" for the unit to make offensive comments about people who are not White, including himself, the lawsuit says.More than a dozen text messages are described in the lawsuit as examples. They include offensive comments about Black, Asian, Jewish and Hispanic people as well anti-LGBTQ remarks. When the officers discussed Black Lives Matter protesters, Harvey texted it was \"time to start killing\" and \"Well they got the Army out there sooooo ... hopefully they will get to kill some people,\" and, \"Kill em all,\" according to the lawsuit. In the months after the 2020 murder of George Floyd by a White police officer in Minneapolis and the protests that followed, Harvey complained about the department's position on Black Lives Matter protests and said the agency should not support protesters, the lawsuit says.  Harvey also referred to Miles as \"colored\" during a roll call meeting on August 4, 2020, the document states.Another text message appears to indicate that Harvey was aware her comments made in the group chat were offensive. \"Joke, don't turn these texts over to [Internal Affairs] and get me fired for hate speech!,\" she wrote in a text message, according to the lawsuit. CNN has reached out to Martin Oliverio, a lawyer who represents Harvey, but has has not received a response.In a statement, the Maryland-National Capital Park Police said the agency launched an investigation when the series of text messages came to their attention but did not specify when that took place.The lawsuit states Miles first reported Harvey's behavior to a captain on August 2020, \"continued harassment and retaliation\" by Harvey and other officers to Internal Affairs on February 2021 and to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on March 2021.Several officers were suspended and referred to the disciplinary process for termination, the Maryland-National Capital Park Police said, adding that it could not discuss further details on the employment status of the officers involved in the text messages.Third lawsuit filed against DC police department alleging racism and a toxic cultureBut the lawsuit notes Harvey was suspended in March 2021 and some of the other officers were promoted since Miles filed his complaints.The department declined to share details about the disciplinary actions taken and said \"the suggestion that Park Police management ignored allegations of misconduct by this group of officers is simply incorrect, and we will make the results of the trial board process public at the appropriate time.\" \"Our Park Police leadership team does not tolerate racism or harassment in the workplace and will not hesitate to put a stop to any such behavior whenever it arises,\" the park police added.Jay Holland, one of the attorneys representing Miles, said there is a \"toxic culture\" within the police department and the work environment that his client endured was horrific. \"A culture where racism and bigotry is the norm cannot be allowed to stand,\" Holland said. \"Officer Miles has been further victimized by his fellow officers and the department for bravely coming forward. After coming forward, he was ostracized by his colleagues, moved to a night shift and he fears for his safety.\" The Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 30, the union representing active and retired officers of the Maryland-National Capital Park Police, declined to comment on the lawsuit.But the union said in a statement that it \"works tirelessly to see that all members are treated fairly, have the best possible work environment and are afforded their due process rights as defined by law.\"Miles faced pressure to leave the unit after he made complaints about the harassment, and ultimately \"involuntarily transferred to another, less desirable night shift,\" last November, the lawsuit says.Attorneys for Miles filed the lawsuit after the Department of Justice issued a right-to-sue letter earlier this month in connection with his complaint to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.He is seeking economic and compensatory damages, a judge order to ensure park police refrain from retaliating against him, the appointment of an independent monitor to ensure compliance of the court's decision, punitive damages against Harvey and the termination of her employment.\"I think this is really indicative of the larger issue of racism that is endemic in policing today,\" said Erika Jacobsen White, another of Miles' attorneys. \"The natural outgrowth of this type of overt and systemic racist mentality in policing is what leads to the kind of police abuses we are seeing across the country.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Brittney Griner, the star basketball player detained in Russia over alleged drug charges, has become the latest of several Americans who have yet to secure their freedom from a country increasingly isolated from the rest of the world.  Russia's invasion of Ukraine brought forth global condemnation from governments and peoples alike, who have since boycotted Russian goods, frozen Russian access to banking systems and enacted crippling sanctions. And amid the growing economic repercussions, families and supporters of Griner and other detained Americans, like Trevor Reed and Paul Whelan, are working to free their loved ones as diplomatic channels fade. Russian authorities said Griner, 31, had cannabis oil in her luggage while in a Moscow airport last month and accused her of smuggling significant amounts of a narcotic substance -- an offense punishable by up to 10 years in prison. A Moscow court has extended her arrest until May 19, according to Russian state news agency TASS. Reed, 30, and Whelan, 52, were arrested and convicted separately for alleged crimes they've emphatically denied well before the Russian incursion of Ukraine, and the pair remain in prison serving extended sentences denounced by US officials as unfair. Here's what we know so far about their detentions.Three Americans detained in Russia, from left to right: Brittney Griner, Paul Whelan and Trevor ReedRead MoreGriner's whereabouts haven't been shared by authoritiesGriner, a two-time Olympic basketball gold medalist, is a star player in both the US and Russia and has been a regular centerpiece in the successes of her teams, the WNBA's Phoenix Mercury and Russian club UMMC Ekaterinburg.Many details of her detention in Moscow remain in question, including the exact date of the arrest and her current location.  US Rep. Colin Allred, whose office has been in touch with the US State Department, said Griner was arrested in Russia on February 17.A photo, posted to social media on February 16, appears to show Griner at a hotel in New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport.  Four days later, Griner's Russian team played in a game and she was not in the lineup.Those close to Griner have expressed their frustration over the detention and lack of clarity provided by Russian authorities. In an Instagram post, Griner's wife, Cherelle, described the agony of waiting.\"There are no words to express this pain. I'm hurting, we're hurting,\" she said.Brittney Griner: Why so many WNBA stars play basketball overseasAlthough a State Department official told CNN the US had been denied consular access to Griner, a source close to the situation told CNN that Griner's Russian legal team has seen her several times a week throughout her detention, and she is well. The Biden administration is working to get Griner out of Russia, members of the Congressional Black Caucus said after meeting last week with President Joe Biden.Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, who represents Griner's hometown of Houston, said she spoke of Griner during the meeting and noted there is a \"need for her to be immediately released and for her to receive the help of the United States to demand and facilitate that release.\"But a US representative cautioned to CNN last week that getting her home is \"going to be very difficult.\" \"Our diplomatic relationships with Russia are nonexistent at the moment,\" Rep. John Garamendi, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said.The state-owned Russia 24 channel said this photo of Brittney Griner was taken at a police station.Reed family spoke with President BidenReed, a former US Marine detained in Russia since 2019, was sentenced to nine years in prison in July 2020 for endangering the \"life and health\" of Russian police officers after a night of drinking, according to state-run news agency TASS.Russian authorities claimed Reed resisted arrest and attacked officers as they responded to complaints of a disturbance, according to Russian state-run news agency RIA-Novosti. Alina Tsybulnik, Reed's girlfriend who was with him that night, heavily disputed police allegations, telling TASS, \"(The police) constantly change their story ... in my opinion, Reed was too drunk to resist them.\"JUST WATCHEDParents of former US Marine jailed in Russia speak outReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHParents of former US Marine jailed in Russia speak out 05:23Reed and his family have denied the charges and US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan called the trial \"theater of the absurd\" after the 2020 sentencing.Joey and Paula Reed, Trevor's parents, spoke with Biden on March 8, shortly after waving at the President's passing motorcade in Fort Worth, Texas, the family said.An attempt to set up a meeting with Biden ahead of the visit was declined, the family said, but Biden later spoke with them via phone. \"I just can't imagine what you're going through,\" Biden could be heard saying on the cell phone's speaker by a CNN producer and other reporters at the scene. \"I don't want you to think that it's not something I constantly think about.\"Family of former US Marine detained in Russia speaks with Biden after his Texas stopThe Reeds grew emotional and stepped away from reporters for the remainder of the conversation with the President, but Paula Reed later shared details of the call, including that Biden told them he \"thinks of Trevor every day and that he feels horrible that he hasn't been able to bring Trevor home yet. And he said, 'We're not going to stop.'\"\"He said he prays for our son every day and that he said a rosary, before he came to Fort Worth, for our son,\" Joey Reed told CNN's Brianna Keilar on \"New Day.\"In recent calls to his parents, including Wednesday morning, Trevor Reed said he had been coughing up blood, had intermittent fevers and had pain in his chest, according to Joey Reed -- and the family is concerned he has tuberculosis. The son delivered more bad news Wednesday: He said he'd had \"some sort of accident\" that's hurt his chest further, Joey Reed said.\"He called and could barely talk,\" the father said. \"He believes he might have broken a rib. So now as he's coughing, he has shooting, stabbing pains in his chest.\" Paula Reed added she thought her son said something had fallen on him from a shelf. Joey Reed also said Trevor told them he would be sent to a hospital prison on Friday to be checked. Although he believed Trevor has been honest about his health, Joey Reed expressed uncertainty that his son's injury was an accident. \"It just seems to be getting worse and worse,\" he said.The parents told their son about their phone call with Biden.\"He said he was very excited for us, but he's still cautiously optimistic,\" Paula Reed said Wednesday. \"I think he doesn't want to get his hopes up too much, so for him it works better if he just kind of downplays everything.\" Family pushes for Whelan's releasePaul Whelan, a US, Irish, British and Canadian citizen and former US Marine, was detained at a Moscow hotel in 2018 and arrested on espionage charges, which he has consistently denied. He was convicted and sentenced in June 2020 to 16 years in prison in a trial widely denounced as unfair by US officials.In a call with CNN in June, Whelan described the grim conditions of the remote labor camp where he spends his days working in a clothing factory that he called a \"sweatshop,\" and said, \"getting medical care here is very difficult.\" Paul Whelan's family stays focused on his release as he nears 3 years in Russian detentionWhelan was getting through his plight \"day by day,\" he told CNN, and was trying to keep \"a positive mental attitude\" about the situation.His family said Whelan has been the subject of retaliation, including serving time in solitary confinement where he was not permitted to shower or exercise. Whelan's siblings have spent the past three years staying in contact with him and advocating on his behalf to lawmakers in Washington, DC, and his sister, Elizabeth Whelan, lauded American officials in Moscow for their work. But the latest strain in relations between the two nations is likely to complicate efforts. \"An unfortunate component about advocating for someone who is wrongfully detained is you have to make your presence known. There's always a crisis going on, and you have to keep reminding people that there is an American who is being held by a hostile foreign nation, often one that we have relations with of some sort, and that this situation has to end,\" Elizabeth Whelan told CNN in December.She praised her brother's perseverance, adding that he \"is bound and determined to survive this situation, and he is not going to give in to the Russians. He is not going to show weakness.\"CNN's Paul P. Murphy, Holly Yan, Lucy Kafanov, Rosa Flores, Wayne Sterling, Chris Boyette, Maegan Vazquez, Ashley Killough, Ed Lavandera, Raja Razek, Chandelis Duster, Jason Hanna and Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)A former police officer is facing a federal charge of using unreasonable force against an individual in the moments leading up to the fatal police shooting of Black restaurant owner David McAtee during the 2020 summer police brutality protests in Louisville.The indictment, filed Wednesday, alleges that former Louisville officer Katie Crews violated the constitutional rights of an individual -- identified only by the initials \"M.M\" -- when she fired a pepper ball, striking the person, who was \"standing on private property and not posing a threat\" to other people. An attorney representing the officer declined to comment. McAtee's popular restaurant, YaYa's BBQ, was near a parking lot where officers -- including Crews -- fired pepper balls in attempts to clear a crowd on June 1, 2020. McAtee was shot as police and Kentucky National Guard members tried to disperse the crowd, according to police, who have said officers were returning fire after being fired upon. One video showed McAtee, 53, at the restaurant door with his right arm extended. Moments later, he is seen clutching his chest, and falling to the ground. No one has been charged in McAtee's killing. Family of Louisville shooting victim David McAtee sues police officers, National Guard membersIn a wrongful death lawsuit filed later that year, McAtee's family alleged police and Kentucky National Guard members chased protesters who were out past the city's dusk-to-dawn curfew to the area where McAtee's business was located and began firing pepper balls in front of the restaurant. Some people attempted to escape by entering the kitchen door while McAtee was inside, unaware of what was happening, the lawsuit alleged. Read MoreMcAtee's niece, Machelle, was hit with pepper balls \"multiple times,\" according to the suit. \"David McAtee stepped out of the kitchen door to try and defend his restaurant, home, family, and customers. Immediately, the police shot and killed him,\" the lawsuit alleged. David McAtee's nephew had also previously told CNN affiliate WAVE that the chef was shot while reaching out to grab his niece. Steve Romines, an attorney representing the McAtee family, confirmed to CNN the individual identified by initials in the indictment is Machelle.\"We agree with the Grand Jury's decision today that criminal activity by LMPD in the unwarranted shooting at innocent bystanders outside of YaYa's BBQ is what directly (led) to the death of David McAtee,\" the attorney told CNN in a statement Thursday.If convicted, Crews could face up to ten years in prison, a $250,000 fine and three years of supervised release, according to the indictment.Dozens came out to remember David McAtee on June 1, 2021, one year since the Louisville barbecue owner was shot and killed.The aftermath of the shootingThe fatal shooting happened amid widespread protests against police brutality and racial injustice that erupted across the city -- and the country -- following the police killings of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville. No charges will be brought against law enforcement over the fatal shooting of a Louisville restaurant owner last yearCrews is the second former Louisville officer to face federal charges of using excessive force during those protests. Former officer Cory Evans pleaded guilty last year to hitting a kneeling person in the head who was surrendering during an arrest in May 2020. He was sentenced last month to two years in prison followed by two years of supervised release. Louisville's police chief was fired hours after McAtee's killing after officials discovered that two officers at the scene -- Crews and Austin Allen -- had either not worn or activated their body cameras, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer had said. Both Crews and Allen were placed on administrative leave pending an investigation into the shooting. National Guard members involved in the incident were not identified, CNN previously reported. Crews was fired on February 7, 2022, according to Louisville police. The department declined to comment further on the matter. CNN has also reached out to the police department for an update on Allen's status.The lawsuit filed by McAtee's family in 2020 named Crews and Allen individually because they were seen in surveillance video shooting pepper balls into the crowd where McAtee was last seen alive, Romines previously told CNN. The suit also accused 10 unnamed Louisville officers and 10 unnamed state National Guard members with using excessive force, among other charges. Louisville officer charged with allegedly hitting a person in the head who was surrendering for arrestKentucky authorities determined that bullets fired from the Kentucky National Guard were responsible for McAtee's death, J. Michael Brown, the secretary for the governor's executive cabinet, said in a statement on June 9, 2020.Nearly a year later, in May 2021, Kentucky Commonwealth Attorney Thomas B. Wine announced the investigation into McAtee's killing would not go to a grand jury for further review, or for potential charges against any Louisville police officers or National Guard soldiers who fired their weapons. Louisville officers and National Guard members \"were authorized to discharge their firearms in defense of human life, including their own, when they reasonably believed, based on the facts and circumstances, that Mr. McAtee posed an immediate threat of death or serious injury to them or to another person,\" Wine concluded. McAtee used to feed officers for freeMcAtee's mother, Odessa Riley, previously said that local officers knew her son well. \"He fed all the policemen,\" Riley said in June 2020. \"Police would go in there and talk with him and be with him. He fed the police. He fed them (for) free.\"Louisville BBQ man who was fatally shot when police dispersed crowd used to feed officers for freeFischer, the mayor, called McAtee a \"wonderful citizen\" in a statement following the killing. \"David was a friend to many, a well-known barbecue man,\" the mayor said. \"They've nurtured so many people in their bellies and in their hearts before, and for him to be caught up in this, not to be with us today, is a tragedy.\"In an interview that had appeared in the West of Ninth photo blog several months before the shooting, McAtee said he had been cooking and selling BBQ for roughly 30 years, and had been at his West Louisville location for about two years. He'd always wanted to be at that location and was hoping to buy the lot and build a more permanent restaurant, he told the blog. \"I gotta start somewhere, and this is where I'm going to start,\" he had said. \"It might take another year or two to get to where I'm going, but I'm going to get there.\"",

Despite widespread calls following the protests for amnesty, the Cuban government has come down hard on demonstrators -- meting out lengthy prison sentences.Shortly after the protests started, police and special forces went door to door looking for those who participated.Read MoreProtesters demonstrate in rare protests in Havana, Cuba, on July 11, 2021.Cuban courts have since been trying hundreds of protestors in mass trials that have been criticized by international observers for their lack of transparency and due process. \"They threw stones and bottles at various officials, law enforcement officers National Revolutionary Police facilities, patrol cars; They overturned a motorcycle and cars...and caused injuries to other people and serious material damage,\" reads the statement from the Supreme Court. They dared to protest last July. Now these Cubans are facing years in jail The protests, from July 11 to 12, rapidly spread across the island as Cubans openly defied the communist-run government -- which blames Cuba's economic woes on US sanctions -- in a way not seen since the 1959 revolution.Cubans chanted \"freedom\" at last year's protests, showing their rage about food shortages, medicine, and electricity when Covid-19 cases had skyrocketed in the country. In Havana, a CNN team witnessed demonstrators being forcibly arrested and thrown into the back of vans by police officers. There were also violent clashes, where protesters turned over a police car and threw rocks at officers.Those protests -- and now the trials -- mark a before and after in the island's history for many Cubans. Some of the protesters' family members say regardless of the mass trials and harsh sentences, anti-government resentment will continue to simmer.",

        "content": "(CNN)It's still not clear why someone would open fire on several homeless men in New York City and Washington, DC.But authorities in both cities say they believe the same man, 30-year-old Gerald Brevard III, is responsible for the shootings that left two men dead. Here's what we know about the suspect -- and how authorities linked him to cases more than 200 miles apart.  The suspect's arrest record stretches back more than a decadeBrevard has faced numerous charges -- such as assault and battery -- in multiple states.Read MoreIn 2010, Brevard was charged with malicious destruction of property in Maryland. That case was resolved with a guilty plea and probation. In 2018, he was charged with assault with a dangerous weapon in Washington, DC. He was found incompetent to stand trial in June 2019 before being found competent the next month. DC authorities identify suspect arrested in connection with shootings of 5 homeless men there and in NYCBrevard accepted a plea agreement and entered a guilty plea. He was given a 12-month suspended sentence and two years of supervised release, also suspended. Brevard was also ordered to undergo mental health and substance abuse assessments, along with drug treatment if it was deemed appropriate.Another special condition required him to \"cooperate with any housing assistance offered.\"Court records show he violated conditions of release both before and after the conviction on the assault with a dangerous weapon charge. It's not clear which conditions he violated.In 2020, Brevard was charged in two different incidents in Fairfax County, Virginia. He was found guilty of a charge of assault and battery and sentenced to a 12-month suspended sentence and 12 months probation. He was also found guilty of entering property to cause damage and sentenced to 12 months, with one month suspended, and 12 months of probation. In November 2020 in Maryland, court records show Brevard was also charged with 33 counts including theft, credit card theft and theft from a vehicle.  He did not appear, and a bench warrant was issued in February 2021. Brevard's bond was forfeited, the case remains open and the warrant still appears to be active. And last month, on February 8, Brevard was charged with probation violation in Virginia. A hearing on the revocation of probation was set for March 17.How this month's shootings unfolded Authorities say they believe Brevard is responsible for shooting five men experiencing homelessness: -- The first shooting happened around 4 a.m. on March 3 in Washington, DC police said. A man wounded in the 1100 block of New York Avenue Northeast was treated at a hospital for non-life-threatening injuries.-- The second shooting happened around 1:21 a.m. March 8 in the 1700 block of H Street Northeast in Washington, police said. A man was taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.-- Shortly after 2:50 a.m. on March 9, a DC Police member noticed a fire in the 400 block of New York Avenue Northeast. After the flames were extinguished, a man's remains were discovered, police said. The cause of death was determined to be multiple stab and gunshot wounds. -- The fourth and fifth shootings happened in New York City early Saturday, March 12. The attacks happened about 90 minutes apart in Lower Manhattan and were caught on surveillance cameras, the New York Police Department said. Police described what the videos showed but did not release them to CNN.In one of the New York shootings, video shows a man sleeping near the corner of King Street and Varick when an attacker approaches and shoots him in his forearm, police said. The 38-year-old victim was taken to a hospital for treatment.The other New York shooting happened around 6 a.m. outside 148 Lafayette Street. There, officers found a man in a sleeping bag with gunshot wounds to his head and neck, police said. He was pronounced dead at the scene.How the suspect was foundCapt. Kevin Kentish, a Queens native who now works with the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, DC, was scrolling through his social media when something caught his eye. A detective on social media helped catch a suspect wanted for shooting homeless men in 2 citiesKentish, who kept up with news from his home state, saw footage that New York City police had released of a person of interest wanted in connection with the shootings of two homeless people there.In Washington, Kentish and his team were investigating the March 9 killing of a homeless person. The detective flagged the photos to his colleagues and they reached out to New York and federal law enforcement agencies and began comparing evidence, including shell casings left behind at the scenes. \"Our partners at the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) tested our evidence that was recovered, they tested the evidence that was recovered in New York and we got a hit,\" Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee said. They were looking for the same person. ATF agents found and arrested Brevard on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington at around 2:30 a.m. Tuesday, authorities said. He was charged with assault with a dangerous weapon and assault with intent to kill in connection with two non-fatal shootings of homeless people and with first-degree murder while armed for the killing of 54-year-old Morgan Holmes, who had no fixed address, Washington police announced Tuesday. CNN was not immediately able to identify an attorney for Brevard.NYPD Chief of Detectives James Essig said although authorities in New York City have not yet announced charges, they believe the same person is responsible for the shootings of two homeless people in that city because of connections through ballistic evidence and clothing in pictures. \"We don't have enough to make an arrest, we're working with the Manhattan district attorney, we're gathering all our evidence,\" Essig said. \"I'm very confident we'll get there.\"Suspect has mental illness, his family saysThe alleged shooter's father, Gerald Brevard Jr., extended condolences to the victims' families and told CNN his son suffers from mental illness.Brevard received psychiatric treatment several years ago after being found mentally incompetent to stand trial for a separate assault charge, according to his father and court records. After three months, Brevard was found competent to stand trial and transferred back to jail, according to court records.But before he was released, his father urged authorities to have him transferred back to a psychiatric hospital because he \"wasn't well,\" but was told that was not possible, he told CNN. \"The bigger picture is not that he has mental illness, but the number of times that he's been within the judicial system and how the system has failed regarding the treatment of so many, including my son.\"He said that his son has lived on and off with his great-aunt but has been experiencing homelessness in the last few years. The suspect's cousin, Rosaline Law, told CNN affiliate WUSA that he has suffered from mental illness \"for a long time.\"She said her mom \"took him in and gave him a chance to get himself together but if you don't get help it's going to keep going to the next level.\"CNN's Christina Maxouris contributed to this report.",

Hardik Patel said he will start shutting off the power to his pumps after business hours after 398 gallons of gas were stolen from his Bizzy Bee Grocery Store and Gas Station in High Point, North Carolina, Monday.Store manager chases van after thieves steal more than 1,000 gallons of diesel fuel from family-owned gas stationSurveillance footage showed a car pull up near the pumps and someone appeared to use a device to bypass the payment system, Patel said. After that, more than 15 cars pulled up and filled their tanks over the course of 45 minutes, taking $1,600 worth of gas, Patel said.\"I've been in business for 15 years and owned other gas stations. I have never seen something like this,\" Patel told CNN. \"It wasn't free, they were stealing.\" Patel said police were alerted to the theft by people who called to report several cars at the station after-hours.Read MoreThe incident comes as gas prices have climbed to recent record highs. The national average reached $4.33 a gallon Monday after setting four records in a row last week. As of Thursday morning, the average was $4.29 a gallon, according to AAA. The spike in gas prices is partially a result of sanctions against oil producer Russia over its invasion of Ukraine as well as a market that was already inflated by lowered production during the Covid-19 pandemic. Police are warning drivers to protect against gas thefts as oil prices soar. Here's what they recommendThe soaring prices have prompted police around the country to warn drivers to protect the gas in their tanks by either purchasing a locking gas cap, parking in a visible well-lit area or avoiding parking in public places for long periods of time. In North Carolina, Patel said if his station is subjected to gas theft \"too often,\" he'll have to consider whether he should stay in the business. \"If I lose more than I make, there might be some things to think about,\" he said.

Christopher Gregor, 29, is also charged with endangering the welfare of a child, according to a news release from Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley D. Billhimer and Barnegat Township Police Chief Keith A. Germain. Gregor is being held without bail, according to the county inmate locator. Gregor's attorney, Mario Gallucci, maintains his client \"had nothing to do with the death of this child.\"Gregor took his son to the hospital on April 2, 2021, after the boy was showing symptoms of nausea and shortness of breath. The son, whose name was withheld from the probable cause affidavit and a police statement, began having seizures and was pronounced dead the same day, the affidavit said.The Ocean County Medical Examiner's Office conducted a post-mortem investigation and noted several bruises and hemorrhaging of the liver. Child abuse hotline calls and texts rose during the pandemic. Here's how to helpRead MoreProsecutors asked Dr. Thomas Andrew of White Mountain Forensic to review the findings, the affidavit said, and he found the boy's cause of death to be \"blunt impact injuries of the chest and abdomen with laceration of the heart,\" among other injuries. The manner of death was determined to be homicide. Andrew also found that the child's injuries were consistent with abuse that occurred over time, finding evidence of chronic abuse, the affidavit states.Prosecutors allege Gregor weighed his son frequently and made him work out to lose weight. Documents state that the boy told his mother Gregor \"made him run on the treadmill because he is fat.\"According to the affidavit, surveillance footage shows Gregor and his son enter a gym in the Atlantic Heights apartment complex where Gregor lived. The boy is seen running on a treadmill and falling off six times. Gregor appears to increase the speed of the treadmill, and his son falls off again, the affidavit said. He is then seen picking the boy up by his shirt and putting him back on the moving treadmill, according to the affidavit.\"The decedent appears to struggle to gain footing, while Gregor appears to be biting on the top of the decedent's head,\" according to the document.Concerns about unreported child abuse loom large despite easing Covid restrictionsThe 6-year-old's mother and grandmother both feared Gregor was abusing the boy, according to the affidavit. His mother took him to a pediatrician and to a hospital the day before he died because of bruising on his body, the affidavit explains. Both the mother and grandmother reported the alleged abuse to New Jersey's Department of Child Protection and Permanency (DCP&P) on numerous occasions, according to the affidavit. CNN reached out to DCP&P for comment Wednesday evening.Other instances of alleged abuse against the child were detailed in the affidavit. The child's grandmother told police Gregor kept her grandson overnight against her will, and when he returned in the morning he had \"blood on his shirt and mouth.\" Separately, a past partner of Gregor told police that she observed Gregor throwing the child off a boat after getting angry while crabbing, later claiming he was just \"rough housing,\" according to the affidavit.Anyone worried about the possibility of abuse or neglect can contact the national child abuse hotline: 1-800-422-4453 or childhelphotline.org.

        "content": "(CNN)Jussie Smollett was released from jail Wednesday night, after an Illinois appeals court granted an emergency motion by his defense attorneys. Smollett's legal team is looking to delay his sentence and grant him bond until their appeal on his conviction is decided on.The former \"Empire\" actor was sentenced last week to 30 months of felony probation -- including 150 days in jail -- and ordered to pay restitution of more than $120,000 and a $25,000 fine for making false reports to police that he was the victim of a hate crime in January 2019.\"There is no room for politics in our court system,\" defense attorney Nenye Uche said in a news conference shortly after the actor's release. \"Regardless of what you think about this case ... the real question is, should Black men be walked into jail for a Class 4 felony?\"Jussie Smollett sentenced to 150 days in jail for lying to police in hate crime hoax\"That's a disgrace,\" the attorney added. Uche, as well as other attorneys from the team who spoke Wednesday, criticized the judge who sentenced Smollett last week. Cook County Judge James Linn spoke to the actor for more than half an hour, criticizing his actions. \"The judge spent a great deal of time chastising, berating my client,\" Uche said. \"I've never seen that before.\"Read MoreOver the past six days in jail, Smollett did not eat anything besides ice water, Uche said.The appeals court order, entered on Wednesday, says Smollett \"shall be released from custody ... upon posting of a personal recognizance bond (I Bond) in the amount of $150,000.\" A personal recognizance bond in Illinois means that a person is released on the condition that they will attend all required future court proceedings, usually without having to pay any money.Smollett's defense filed the emergency motion last week, arguing he would be \"irreparably harmed\" if he serves a sentence for convictions that may be reversed, adding that he will likely serve his jail time before the completion of his appeal.The attorneys added that exposure to Covid-19 is a serious risk because Smollett is immunocompromised.The court granted the attorneys' motion, reasoning that it would be \"unable to dispose of the instant appeal before the defendant would have served his entire sentence of incarceration.\"In their response filed Wednesday, prosecutors vehemently disagreed with the defense's reasoning, arguing that there is \"no emergency that warrants the extraordinary relief\" of delaying Smollett's sentence while his appeal is pending.\"Mr. Smollett asserts that he is entitled a stay because he will most likely serve his short, 150-day jail sentence before his appeal on the merits is decided,\" part of the response read. \"According to this logic, every defendant sentenced to a term of imprisonment less than a few years would automatically receive a stay pending appeal.\"Actor Jussie Smollett walked out of jail Wednesday night.Smollett had an outburst in court last weekSmollett was found guilty in December on five counts of felony disorderly conduct for making false reports about what he said was an anti-gay and anti-Black hate crime.Jussie Smollett's return to acting 'up in the air,' says representativeThe actor, who is Black and gay, told Chicago police that two unknown men attacked him on one January 2019 night, yelled racist and homophobic slurs at him, poured bleach on him and wrapped a noose around his neck. But investigators said they determined the actor orchestrated the attack and paid two brothers he knew from the Fox drama series to stage the act for publicity.Smollett maintained his innocence under oath during his trial.But during last week's sentencing, Judge James Linn told Smollett, \"You're not a victim of a racial hate crime, you're not a victim of a homophobic hate crime. You're just a charlatan pretending to be a victim of a hate crime.\"The judge spoke for more than half an hour during the proceeding, telling the actor that while many people vouched for Smollett and his character and asked the judge for a lenient sentence, Smollett's premeditation in the act he orchestrated was an \"aggravating factor\" in the case. \"You do have quite a record of real community service,\" the judge said Thursday. \"I'm mindful of pleas of mercy, particularly from people that are in the arena.\" But, ultimately, the judge said, this act showed Smollett's \"dark side.\"Following the announcement of his sentence, Smollett addressed the judge, saying \"I did not do this,\" before turning to the court and exclaiming he was not suicidal, and that \"if anything happens to me when I go in there, I did not do it to myself. And you must all know that.\"The judge ordered Smollett to be held in protective custody \"by Mr. Smollett's request and this court's recommendation,\" CNN previously reported. On Friday, the actor was being housed \"in his own cell, which is monitored by security cameras in the cell and by an officer wearing a body worn camera who is stationed at the entrance of the cell to ensure that Mr. Smollett is under direct observation at all times,\" the Cook County Sheriff's Office said, stressing that the actor was not being held in solitary confinement.JUST WATCHEDUnpacking media baggage in the Jussie Smollett caseReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHUnpacking media baggage in the Jussie Smollett case 02:38Attorney calls charges unconstitutionalSmollett was initially indicted in March 2019 on 16 counts of felony disorderly conduct after police determined his reports were false. In a stunning reversal days later, prosecutors announced they were dropping all charges. In a Chicago Sun-Times op-ed published last week, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx defended her office's decision, saying Smollett had already forfeited a $10,000 bond, had not been accused of a violent crime before and had paid a \"reputational price\" for what he did. The incident effectively ended Smollett's acting career. Jussie Smollett convicted in hate crime hoax. Here's how we got here Dan K. Webb, the special prosecutor later assigned to the case, announced he would further prosecute Smollett.  In February 2020, a Cook County grand jury returned a six-count indictment against the actor for making false reports -- five counts of which Smollett was eventually convicted of and sentenced for.A disorderly conduct charge for a false crime report is a Class 4 felony and punishable by up to three years in prison and a $25,000 fine.Webb said last week he was \"extraordinarily pleased\" with the sentence Judge Linn handed down and that the judge's comments showed \"he clearly has understood ... that this was a course of conduct that deserved severe punishment.\"But during Wednesday night's news conference, Uche, one of Smollett's attorney's, called the proceedings in the case unconstitutional, as Smollett had already been charged before, had paid $10,000 and done community service.\"When this case was initially re-indicted, when this case was prosecuted, when this case was sentenced, at each of those steps I wondered to myself whether Chicago has ceded from the Union. Because in this country, you cannot punish a person twice,\" the attorney said. \"While everyone was focused on the sensationalism surrounding this case, people were not focused on the constitutionality of the prosecution.\"",

Leaders from both cities held a joint news conference Monday and appealed to the public for help in identifying the suspect. An anonymous tip helped lead to his identity.Read MoreATF agents found and arrested 30-year-old Gerald Brevard III on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington at around 2:30 a.m. Tuesday, authorities said. He was charged with assault with a dangerous weapon and assault with intent to kill in connection with two non-fatal shootings of homeless people and with first-degree murder while armed for the killing of 54-year-old Morgan Holmes, who also had no fixed address, Washington police announced Tuesday.

His next status hearing is scheduled for April 1. 'A jarring act against a defenseless person'The first known shooting happened around 4 a.m. on March 3 in DC, police said. Officers responded to sounds of gunshots and found a man suffering from apparent gunshot wounds, who was taken to a hospital for non-life-threatening injuries. On March 8, DC authorities responded to reports of another shooting a little after 1:20 a.m., and found a man suffering from apparent gunshot wounds who was also treated for non-life threatening injuries. Both victims are recovering, Contee said this week. On March 9, at about 2:52 a.m., a DC police member noticed a fire. The remains of a man -- who police later identified as Holmes -- were discovered and he was pronounced dead at the scene. A medical examiner determined the victim died of multiple stab and gunshot wounds. All three victims appeared to be experiencing homelessness, DC police said. At about 4:30 a.m. on March 12, officers in New York City responded to a 38-year-old man who had been shot in the arm while sleeping, Essig said. Roughly 90 minutes later, another man who was sleeping on a sidewalk was shot multiple times and was pronounced dead on the scene, Essig said. \"You're kind of taken aback and you're shocked that someone can commit such a jarring act against a defenseless person,\" Essig said.As soon as they linked the two shootings, New York police held a news conference Saturday night and released images of their person of interest. That's when Kentish, the DC detective, saw the pictures, according to officials.Washington police contacted the NYPD on Sunday morning, Essig said, and by 2 p.m., \"it is confirmed that all five instances -- the three in DC and the two in New York City -- are a match and are a ballistics' lead.\"Authorities say they're still investigating how the suspect moved between the two cities, but suspect he may have taken public transportation, Essig said. A gun has not been recovered as part of the investigation, authorities said. The suspect has had \"multiple contacts with police in various states,\" Essig said. Brevard has not offered a motive, Contee said, and authorities are not certain about any connections he may have to the victims.Suspect has mental illness, his family saysThe alleged shooter's father, Gerald Brevard Jr., extended condolences to the victims' families and told CNN his son suffers from mental illness.Brevard received psychiatric treatment several years ago after being found mentally incompetent to stand trial for a separate assault charge, according to his father and court records. After three months, Brevard was found competent to stand trial and transferred back to jail, according to court records.But before he was released, his father urged authorities to have him transferred back to a psychiatric hospital because he \"wasn't well,\" but was told that was not possible, he told CNN. \"The bigger picture is not that he has mental illness, but the number of times that he's been within the judicial system and how the system has failed regarding the treatment of so many, including my son.\"He said that his son has lived on and off with his great-aunt but has been experiencing homelessness in the last few years. The suspect's cousin, Rosaline Law, told CNN affiliate WUSA that he has suffered from mental illness \"for a long time.\"She said her mom \"took him in and gave him a chance to get himself together but if you don't get help it's going to keep going to the next level.\"Brevard has an arrest record dating back over a decade across several states. In 2010, he was charged with malicious destruction of property in Maryland -- which was resolved with a guilty plea and probation. He was charged in 2018 with assault with a dangerous weapon in DC, for which he eventually pleaded guilty as part of a plea agreement and was handed 12 months of a suspended sentence and two years of supervised release, also suspended. Brevard was ordered to undergo mental health and substance abuse assessments. Court records show he violated conditions of his release  before and after his conviction. He was charged again in 2020 in two separate incidents in Fairfax County, Virginia -- and was found guilty of  a charge of assault and battery and of entering property to cause damage. Last month, he was charged with a probation violation in the state. And in November 2020, Brevard was charged with 33 counts including theft, credit card theft and theft from a vehicle in Maryland, court records show. A judge issued a bench warrant last February -- which still appears to be active -- after Brevard failed to appear in court. What advocates say the shootings highlightAs police searched for the perpetrator of the crimes, DC and New York City leaders urged homeless residents to seek shelter. But advocates say that for some people experiencing homelessness, shelters can be unsafe and dangerous environments too, and that the recent spate of violence highlights how important it is for elected leaders to invest in ensuring housing and resources for homeless residents.New York City announces plan to increase safety, address homelessness in subway system\"We know that homeless people are more likely to be the victims of crimes than the perpetrators but, unfortunately, much of the discourse lately has been vilifying homeless New Yorkers and painting them as dangerous, rather than recognizing the inherent dangers that people without housing face,\" Jacquelyn Simone, policy director for the Coalition for the Homeless, told CNN affiliate WABC.The group has also linked New York City Mayor Eric Adams' recent initiative to clear out the subways to the violence. Officials say the city's plan, which Adams unveiled in a joint news conference with Gov. Kathy Hochul last month, will work to combat crime and address homelessness in the subway system, but critics have said it criminalizes people experiencing homelessness and mental illness. At least 6 NYC subway stabbings reported since the mayor unveiled new safety plan Friday\"We had said at the time that if the city was not actually investing in the types of shelters and permanent housing that people want and need, that people would just be relocated from the subways onto the streets,\" Simone told the affiliate. Adams stood by the initiative this week, telling reporters, \"We are not going to allow the residents of our city to be in a position where they can't take care of themselves or they're dangerous to others.When asked on Monday about the efforts to help unsheltered residents find permanent housing, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser said the city is continuing a pilot program that aims to provide people living in certain encampment sites with resources, move them to affordable housing and clear out unsafe living areas.But advocates have expressed concern that the program could leave many people on the margins again if unsheltered residents aren't properly accommodated as officials clear out the sites -- and could contribute to further criminalizing homelessness.

        "content": "(CNN)In the winter of 2015, computer hackers working for the Russian government attacked Ukraine's power grid and switched off the lights and heat to more than 200,000 consumers. Last year, a cybercriminal group with operatives in Russia launched a successful ransomware attack on a key East Coast pipeline that forced the company, Colonial Pipeline, to temporarily close the spigot and pay 75 bitcoins -- or $4.4 million -- to bring it back online. It was the largest cyberattack on an oil facility in US history. And it was a Russian government lab that built tools used in one of the most dangerous cyber offensives in the history of the digital age, penetrating the control systems of a Saudi petrochemical plant in 2017 for the purpose of setting off an explosion that, had it succeeded, could have killed people.So established is Russia's reputation for cyber sabotage that on February 24 -- as its troops began rolling into Ukraine -- President Joe Biden issued a warning to the country and its autocratic leader, Vladimir Putin. \"If Russia pursues cyberattacks against our companies, our critical infrastructure, we are prepared to respond,\" he said during remarks from the White House.Read MoreBut now, even as the Russian army drops bombs and mortar shells on civilians in hospitals and neighborhoods and its invasion of Ukraine nears its fourth week, no known nightmare cyber scenario --- a widespread power outage, a poisoned water system, a crippled supply chain -- has come to pass in Ukraine, the US or elsewhere.Ukraine detains 'hacker' accused of aiding Russian troops amid broader struggle to secure communicationsTo be sure, a ripple of smaller cyberattacks ricocheted through the websites of Ukrainian banks and government agencies just before the invasion, and larger attacks may still be in store for the besieged country of 43 million people. But the general consensus among the nearly 20 experts who spoke with CNN for this story is that while Russia is well positioned to launch catastrophic cyberattacks on the US, it is not likely to do so.\"We do need to consider this possibility as a low probability but high-impact scenario,\" said Paul Prudhomme, the head of threat intelligence advisory at the cybersecurity firm IntSights.The prospects for a grand-scale cyberattack in America are low, experts say. For one, Putin understands that his country's cyber capabilities, though formidable, are outmatched by those of the United States, which is generally thought to be the most sophisticated player in the domain. The federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency told CNN it hasn't yet received any credible cyber threats resulting from the conflict in Ukraine, but it emphasized that the energy sector has been bolstering its defenses in recent years and is on high alert as it urgently prepares for any attempted breach.Experts say Russia's ability to conduct an impactful cyberattack in the US shouldn't be underestimated. \"If we look at just what they've been able to do, there is only, according to public knowledge, one country out there that has any experience taking down electric systems -- that's Russia,\" said Robert M. Lee, a cybersecurity expert who investigated the 2015 attack in Ukraine.Testing the watersCyberattacks against the US by Russia are more than merely possible -- they've been happening for years on a low-grade scale.The country has been testing the waters in the US, laying the groundwork, experts say, for a much more extensive cyber campaign.For instance, in 2018, the Department of Homeland Security revealed that a group of state-sponsored hackers from Russia had compromised the networks of multiple US electric utilities the year prior and allowed intruders to gather detailed information on the control systems that US electric utilities use to power American communities. That same year, the Department of Justice announced the indictments of 12 Russian intelligence officers for carrying out large-scale cyber operations against the Democratic Party in advance of the 2016 presidential election.Then, in late 2020, came the most advanced cyber-op yet: About 100 organizations around the world -- including multiple US government agencies -- were revealed to have been breached by Russian hackers who compromised the software provider SolarWinds and exploited their access to monitor internal operations and withdraw data. (L-R) FireEye CEO Kevin Mandia, SolarWinds CEO Sudhakar Ramakrishna and Microsoft President Brad Smith testify during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Capitol Hill on February 23, 2021.Putin has been systematically testing vulnerabilities in Europe and the US for the past four years, and is in a position to cause all sorts of economy-crushing problems, experts say.\"They know how to weaponize these things -- they've done it,\" said Melissa Hathaway, who led cybersecurity initiatives in the presidential administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama. \"If I need to cause a national crisis in another country, they know how to do this, they've systematically been testing the system.\"Prudhomme said a stealthy Russian hacking group called Energetic Bear -- which has been tied to Moscow's Federal Security Service, or FSB -- is the most likely Russian third-party, state-sponsored actor to execute any high-level attack.The group, which industry analysts refer to by several aliases, including \"Dragonfly\" and \"Berserk Bear,\" has carried out a number of successful hacks in recent years. In 2017, it targeted a nuclear power plant in Kansas in what cybersecurity experts refer to as a \"watering hole\"-type attack -- a practice where hackers place malicious links on websites frequently visited by employees.\"The group has a history of gaining access and maintaining access to US and European utility companies, but they don't do anything with it,\" Prudhomme said. \"They want to have that access ready at a moment's notice so, if and when they get the order on demand, they can flip the switch.\"In 2020, another state-sponsored Russian group identified by analysts as Cozy Bear, believed to be within Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR, likely orchestrated the SolarWinds hack. US officials said the group used SolarWinds software to breach internal email systems at the US Treasury and Commerce departments, among other key agencies, in what was one of the largest-ever cyber attacks.But it's a two-way street. Experts say that while it's true Russians are lurking in the software of various structural areas, Americans are also lurking in theirs. It's the \"cyber equivalent of mutually assured destruction,\" said Karen Walsh, CEO of a cybersecurity firm called Allegro Solutions, using a term that historically described a philosophy of deterrence during the nuclear standoff of the Cold War. And the Americans, experts say, are currently the more capable threat.While Russian cyberattacks tend to attract headlines, experts told CNN, the most sophisticated hacks are often carried out in a more professionalized manner by countries such as the US and Israel, which are good at hiding their tracks. One secret operation that spilled into public view in 2010 was known as Stuxnet, in which the US and Israel are widely believed to have jointly sabotaged a nuclear facility in Iran with a computer virus that temporarily hampered the country's nuclear program.Putin, experts say, understands the extent of this sophistication and is likely loath to poke the bear.  \"He seems to recognize that that's a different level of escalation,\" Timothy Frye, Columbia professor and author of \"Weak Strongman: The Limits of Power in Putin's Russia,\" said of a crippling cyberattack on a major electric utility in the US or another NATO country. \"That might be part of the calculations as well.\"Russia's cyber offensive against Ukraine has been limited so far. Experts are divided on whyStill, some experts say, Europe's critical infrastructure could be an enticing target for Russia. That's in part because the continent is far more dependent on Russian oil than the US is.\"I don't think anyone's thought through how much control Russia has over the future of Europe,\" said Hathaway, now the president of Hathaway Global Strategies.  Putin has been most willing to wreak havoc on the Ukrainian power grid, which the Russians also hacked in 2016 -- just a year after shutting off power to more than 200,000 consumers. Lee said the second attack -- which reportedly took out about a fifth of the power consumption in Kyiv for an hour -- was by far the more impressive of the two.  \"That one scared the hell out of everybody,\" said Lee, now CEO of a cybersecurity firm called Dragos and a former cyber warfare specialist with the Air Force. \"That was a capability they developed that could be deployed on any electric transmission site in the world and have reliable effects everywhere. Like, it was -- it was bad.\"The United States and the United Kingdom also have blamed the NotPetya hack of 2017 -- which the Trump administration called \"the most destructive and costly cyber-attack in history\" -- on Russia.The NotPetya attack was launched against a Ukrainian accounting software firm, but the malware spread to companies across the globe, resulting in billions of dollars in damage.\"It was part of the Kremlin's ongoing effort to destabilize Ukraine and demonstrates ever more clearly Russia's involvement in the ongoing conflict,\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in 2018.Some experts say the extensive meddling in Ukraine is due in part to how the country is seen as a kind of testing ground for belligerent cyberactivity. This is because the country's power grid is in some ways similar in structure to those in the US and other Western countries, but Ukraine's ability to retaliate has historically been minimal. Still, the US has seen a rise in high-profile cyberattacks. The growing threat prompted Biden to issue an executive order in May to shore up the nation's cybersecurity and protect federal government networks. And it is a reminder that cyber defense in the United States has troubling vulnerabilities. The US has 'significant' cyber vulnerabilitiesIf the Colonial Pipeline breach demonstrated anything, it is the extent to which critical infrastructure in America is susceptible to cyberattacks. That event in May prompted the Georgia-based company to shut down the pipeline for the first time in its 57-year history. The six-day shutdown scrambled logistics for several airlines and caused a panic at the pump that led to shortages and briefly raised gas prices. But while it was allegedly carried out by a Russian hacker group called DarkSide, authorities haven't been able to link it to the Kremlin. (In fact, the Russian domestic intelligence agency arrested the alleged culprit -- though the hacker was not extradited.) The ordeal ended when Colonial ponied up the $4.4 million ransom \u2014 more than half of which was later recovered by the Justice Department. Motorists wait in line at a gas station on May 12, 2021 in Fayetteville, North Carolina, following the Colonial Pipeline hack. That attack, Prudhomme stressed, was financially motivated. The hackers, he said, used a compromised password found in a dark-web data dump and were able to employ an inactive VPN account to penetrate the Colonial Pipeline's network, which didn't use multifactor authentication. \"Criminal hackers will tend to go for low-hanging fruit,\" he said. \"The point of entry here was fairly simple.\"Another sensitive breach happened in early 2021, when hackers -- whose country of origin isn't known -- were able to gain access to a Florida water treatment facility by using dormant remote access software for the purpose of poisoning the water supply. The hack was quickly caught by a human operator at the facility. But the incident illustrates the dangers of remote access work without proper security: The plant had used multiple computers running an aging version of Microsoft Windows to monitor the facility remotely. All of the computers shared a single password.About a year later -- this past January -- the Biden administration announced a plan to shore up the cyber defenses of the nation's roughly 150,000 public water systems. But even if localized networks are vulnerable, experts say that the American power grid is far too complex to shut down in one simple motion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you have information to share about this story? We offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\n\n\n\n\n\"For a successful attack to be able to take the lights out, they need to gain access to a lot of different points ... and nobody is looking,\" said Vikram Thakur, technical director at cybersecurity company Symantec. \"We don't think it's plausible.\" Sophisticated hackers could, however, still seize on any vulnerabilities to cause smaller-scale damage to the electrical grid and other means of energy production.Smaller utility companies may not be able to make enough of an investment in cybersecurity, potentially making their systems more vulnerable to attacks. The equipment and devices specifically used to distribute electricity to consumers are also more at risk, experts say, because they are not required to adhere to federal cybersecurity standards that apply to the higher-voltage generators and transmission lines in the electrical industry.And while new cybersecurity requirements were introduced for certain oil and gas pipelines last year, they are not as comprehensive as the electrical industry standards and there aren't federal cybersecurity regulations for water systems, said Ernie Hayden, who has spent decades working in the power sector, identifying risks to energy and electric providers as a chief information security officer, cybersecurity engineer and consultant.If networks aren't properly secured, a hacker could not only launch a ransomware or malware attack but directly infiltrate systems, known as operational technology, that control critical equipment, said Hayden.Depending on the location of the attack and the lack of controls, this could result in a range of potential outcomes. If hackers get into the operational controls of a water system -- as nearly happened in Florida last year -- they could potentially poison a water supply by causing chlorine to be injected at a dangerous level, said Hayden. They could cause short power outages if they found a way to access devices that control the circuit breakers at one of the country's tens of thousands of substations, which are used to transform voltage before electricity is delivered. And turning off the ventilation controls or valves that control the flow of chemicals, gas and oil at refineries could cause equipment failures and leaks, he said.  Even these smaller-scale, localized disruptions are unlikely, however, and experts said they would not cause the cascading blackouts or mass destruction that many fear. But they could still have a psychological impact, which may be the intent of the attacker. Tom Alrich, a cybersecurity risk management consultant specializing in supply chain threats to software, said he doesn't believe hackers, including any from Russia, would be able to cause outages by accessing electrical infrastructure. Even if they could, he said, they would get nothing out of it. Instead, Alrich said, the focus should be on ransomware attacks that shut down a company's operations without directly attacking the systems that control the physical infrastructure, which is what happened in the case of the Colonial Pipeline, or cyberattacks that \"poison\" the software developed by a given company or organization, such as the infamous SolarWinds hack. Max Stier, president and CEO of Partnership for Public Service -- a nonpartisan non-profit that promotes better government -- pointed to some federal failures. He noted that the Department of Energy has some key positions unfilled because the US Senate has been slow to confirm nominees. \"The notion of cyber risk is profound,\" Stier said. \"It's a battlefield that doesn't respect physical boundaries, one where we know the Russians already have been playing, and not just the Russians; and it's one where we have significant vulnerability.\" CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated the number of organizations breached in the SolarWinds hack. The figure is about 100.",

        "content": "(CNN)A participant in the 1989 Tiananmen Square student-led protest who later became an immigration lawyer in Queens, New York, was allegedly stabbed to death on Monday by a client.Jim Li, 66, moved to the United States in the early '90s after being incarcerated for a year and eight months in Qincheng Prison, a maximum-security prison in Beijing, China. He became an immigration lawyer, often serving members of the community with pro bono services, Li's friend Wayne Zhu told CNN.On Monday, Li was allegedly stabbed four times in the neck and body by 25-year-old Xiaoning Zhang, according to the New York Police Department. He was transported to Elmhurst Hospital where he was pronounced dead.Zhang has been charged with murder in the second degree and two counts of criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree, according to a criminal complaint. Zhang's attorney did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.Li had been Zhang's attorney for about two months, police say. What led to the attack is still under investigation, Detective Adam Navarro said. Police recovered two knives at the scene of the incident.Read MoreZhu, Li's friend, said Zhang and Li had a verbal altercation on March 11 about her asylum case, which resulted in a police response. Li did not want Zhang to be arrested and urged the police to \"let her go,\" Zhu said.\"I don't know why she became that angry,\" Zhu said. \"She came back (March 14) with two knives.\"Violent crime rises in New York CityNew York City has seen an uptick in violent crime in recent weeks, with the NYPD recording increases in every major crime category last month, compared to the same period in 2021.In February 2022, murders increased by 10.3%, felony assaults increased by 22.3%, and overall crime increased by nearly 59% when compared to one year ago, according to the latest NYPD Crime Statistics report.On Wednesday, a man was arrested in connection with the shooting of five homeless men in New York City and Washington, DC. Another man was arrested in Philadelphia after allegedly stabbing two staffers at the Museum of Modern Art in midtown Manhattan. And last week, an Asian man was hit with a hammer during a dispute. Hate crime charges have been filed against the individual involved.To address the rise in crime, New York City Mayor Eric Adams has unveiled a Subway Safety Plan to respond to crime in the city's transit system, and on Monday, the NYPD rolled out its Neighborhood Safety Teams initiative to battle an increase in gun violence.Public safety begins with the right leadership, Adams said Tuesday, explaining that there shouldn't be a \"trade-off\" with safety and justice.\"I am not going to allow the numerical minority that are the loudest to dictate how we're going to keep my city safe now and what are we going to do in the long term,\" Adams said during an episode of the \"You and Me Both\" podcast. \"I tell people all the time, it is not what happens in tweets, it is what happens on our streets.\"Li is among at least 27 people who have been murdered in New York City this year, statistics show. Zhu said Li's loss will be felt throughout the community, particularly for his assistance to recent immigrants from China.\"He's a great man. He helped many people. Many people, they came from China and could not attain a lawyer. He offered pro bono service (to those) he did not know before,\" Zhu said.",

        "content": "(CNN)The Justice Department has charged five people with helping the Chinese Communist Party stalk, harass or spy on political dissidents in the US, including a congressional candidate and a Los Angeles sculpture artist, according to new court filings and a press release.\"All the defendants allegedly perpetrated transnational repression schemes to target U.S. residents whose political views and actions are disfavored by the (People's Republic of China) government, such as advocating for democracy in the PRC,\" a DOJ press release said.In arrests that targeted a ring of three men, the DOJ charged Fan \"Frank\" Liu, 62, whom the DOJ said is the head of a \"purported media company;\" Matthew Ziburis, 49, a former correctional officer in Florida; and Qiang \"Jason\" Sun, a tech company employee based in China. Ziburis and Liu, who both lived on Long Island, have been arrested and are set to appear in court.The trio's spying conspiracy, the Justice Department said, targeted pro-democracy dissidents in New York City, Indiana and California, including an artist whose sculpture of the Chinese President as a coronavirus molecule they sought to destroy -- and which ultimately was burned down. Ziburis, in pursuit of the artist, posed as an art dealer, then installed tracking devices in the artist's workplace and car, prosecutors alleged.Read MoreThe group also worked to host what the Justice Department called \"mock media sessions\" to interview dissidents in ways that could harm their reputations.In another criminal case made public on Wednesday, Shujun Wang, a 73-year-old activist in Queens, was working at the direction of the Chinese secret police, the Ministry of State Security.Prosecutors say Wang sent information he learned about pro-democracy and human rights activists and Chinese dissidents back to China. A handler from the secret police instructed Wang at one point to meet with a person in contact with \"Tibetans, Uyghurs and Mongolians,\" ethnic groups that the Chinese government has oppressed.One dissident about whom Wang sent information was ultimately arrested in Hong Kong and jailed for political crimes, the Justice Department said.Wang is also accused of lying to federal authorities when he denied being in touch with Chinese secret police contacts in 2017. The Justice Department says he later admitted his actions to an undercover law enforcement officer and others. He too has been arrested, the department said.In a news conference Wednesday afternoon, Matthew Olsen, the assistant attorney general for national security, said that while the three cases are charged separately, they \"expose attempts by the government of the People's Republic of China to suppress dissenting voices within the United States.\"\"Authoritarian states around the world feel emboldened to reach beyond their borders to intimidate or exact reprisals against individuals who dare to speak out against oppression and corruption,\" Olsen said, adding, \"We will not tolerate such oppression here.\"RELATED: Justice Department ends Trump-era China Initiative following bias concernsAlan E. Kohler Jr., who is the assistant director of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division, said that the three cases are emblematic of the \"overall rise of authoritarianism\" around the world.\"Whether it is disinformation from a Russian intelligence service, efforts to silence a US-based journalist by the intelligence arm of the government of Iran or harassment by the government of China's Ministry of State Security,\" Koehler said, \"the FBI will protect the freedom of everyone within our borders.\"Koehler encouraged private investigators and local law enforcement agencies to report potential crimes to the FBI, saying that there are \"dozens\" of transnational repression cases pending in the Untitled States, but \"we believe we should have hundreds.\"\"Unlike the Chinese, Russian or Iranian intelligence services, whose only loyalty is to the regime, the FBI is committed to upholding the Constitution and protecting all American people,\" Koehler said.Charges against retired Chinese agentEarlier Wednesday, charges against a retired Chinese intelligence agent, Qiming Lin, were unsealed in federal court in New York. That Chinese citizen is accused of conspiracy after he tried to enlist a private investigator's help to smear a 2022 congressional candidate in New York. Lin remains at large, the Justice Department said Wednesday.Lin is accused of conspiring to harass and surveil a candidate for Congress, described as a former student leader in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 who then came to the US. The candidate running for the House of Representatives is Xiong Yan, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Yan is seeking the Democratic nomination for a seat representing the eastern part of New York's Long Island. According to his campaign website, he was a pastor in Queens and served in the US Army. He was a graduate student at Beijing University Law School and came to the United States in 1992, his website says.CNN has reached out to Yan for comment.Federal investigators are \"investigating a scheme to undermine the candidacy of a U.S.-based Chinese dissident for the U.S. Congress in the general election of 2022 in order to prevent that candidate from drawing additional public attention to himself and his political speech,\" according to the complaint, made public Wednesday.\"I further assess that Lin was seeking to undermine the Victim's candidacy because of the Victim's past status as a student leader of the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989,\" an FBI agent wrote to the court in New York.The case dates back to September 2021, when Lin reached out to a private investigator to gather information about the congressional candidate. The FBI said Wednesday that Lin is retired from China's Ministry of State Security and still lives in China. \"Based on my experience and training, I assess that Lin continued to act on behalf of the MSS even if ostensibly retired,\" FBI agent Jason Schwartz wrote in the complaint.The private investigator reported their interactions to the FBI, allowing law enforcement to listen to interactions between the two. On one phone call that law enforcement listened to, Lin said to the private investigator, \"Right now we don't want him to be elected,\" according to the complaint.In another call, Lin told the private investigator, \"If you don't find anything after following him for a few weeks, can we manufacture something?\" On Lin's calls with the private investigator, Lin floated the idea of creating a scandal about the congressional candidate, such as accusing him of stealing or having an extramarital affair. Lin also discussed planting a female campaign staffer to record having a relationship with the candidate, according to the complaint.\"There are, uh, some-some, uh who speak negatively about China,\" Lin told the investigator, saying that if the investigator could get information, \"then this side will hold you in very high regards in the future.\" Lin discussed paying the private investigator on a trip he planned to the US following the Winter Olympics in Beijing this year. He made clear that price was no issue, the FBI noted.The criminal complaint also makes clear that the case is not just about one man trying to smear another -- and has broader implications for American politics.

        "content": "(CNN)President Joe Biden marked the long-stalled reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act with an event at the White House on Wednesday, celebrating its passage and underscoring that more still needs to be done to combat domestic violence. \"It took time to change the culture, and you did it. You did it,\" Biden said to an audience of lawmakers, administration officials and advocates. \"The only way we can change the culture was by shining an ugly, bright light on it and speaking its name.\"The landmark law is aimed at protecting and supporting survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking. Biden helped write the original piece of legislation that was enacted in 1994 when he was a senator from Delaware and has long been a champion of the law.The President also thanked those in the room for their \"courage, for being a hero, sharing your powerful voices and standing up for thousands of women.\"After acknowledging the law's continued improvements over the years, Biden concluded his remarks by emphasizing that more must be done to address abuse. Read More\"No one, regardless of gender or sexual orientation, should experience abuse. Period. And if they do they should have the service and support to get through it, and we're not going to rest,\" Biden said. Attendees at the White House event included Attorney General Merrick Garland, Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra, several members of the US House and Senate, CEO and President of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence Ruth Glenn and actress and activist Angelina Jolie.The legislation requires renewal every five years, and it lapsed several years ago largely due to a partisan disagreement over whether to ban dating partners and stalkers convicted of domestic violence from owning firearms. The current law bans a spouse convicted of domestic violence from purchasing or possessing a firearm, but Democrats have long sought to close the so-called boyfriend loophole and extend that rule to dating partners. Republicans and the National Rifle Association are strongly opposed to such a provision. After several years of failed attempts at reauthorizing the legislation, a bipartisan group of senators announced last month they had reached a deal and that the \"boyfriend loophole\" provision had been dropped. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, said at the time that it was a \"tough choice\" to agree to drop it but that it simply did not have the votes needed to pass. In his remarks on Wednesday, the President lamented the legislation's delayed authorization, saying, \"The idea that this took five years to reauthorize ... I was out of office those years.\"The reauthorization of the law was included in a massive spending bill that Biden signed into law on Tuesday. The legislation will fund the federal government through September and provide $13.6 billion in additional aid to Ukraine as the country fights back against Russia's invasion. \"The VAWA Reauthorization Act of 2022 will expand prevention efforts and protections for survivors, including those from underserved communities, and will provide increased resources and training for law enforcement and our judicial system,\" Biden said in a statement last month when the bill was introduced. \"It will strengthen rape prevention and education efforts, support rape crisis centers, improve the training of sexual assault forensic examiners, and broaden access to legal services for all survivors, among other things.\"Biden on Tuesday touted the reauthorization of VAWA at the spending bill signing, saying that he \"law has saved lives, and that's helped women rebuild their lives and make children a heck of a lot safer.\"\"Tribal courts will now be able to exercise jurisdiction over non-Native perpetrators of sexual assault and sex trafficking,\" Biden said. \"And we're providing more support for legal services and for law enforcement to get the training they need to help handle the trauma survivors are experiencing.\"CNN's Sam Fossum contributed to this report.",

On Wednesday, Hojjat Kermani, Zaghari-Ratcliffe's lawyer, told CNN he did not want to comment on the latest developments for now.He earlier told Reuters that Zaghari-Ratcliffe and another detained British-Iranian, Anousheh Ashouri, were \"on their way to the airport in Tehran to leave Iran.\"Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he was \"delighted\" that Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been freed from \"wrongful imprisonment\" in a statement Wednesday.\"Nazanin and her loved ones have shown great courage, strength and steadfastness during what has been an unimaginably difficult time, and I want to pay tribute to all those who have campaigned tirelessly for her release,\" said Khan. \"London looks forward to welcoming her home.\"Her husband Richard Ratcliffe said the release of his wife means they can \"start being a normal family again.\"  Speaking to reporters in London, Ratcliffe said he hadn't yet spoken to his wife but that they had exchanged messages on Wednesday.He said she got picked up by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard at 11:00 a.m. local time (3:30 a.m ET) and that although she \"wasn't really allowed to speak\" he was aware of her movements. \"Her homecoming is a journey not an arrival. There will be a whole process and hopefully we will look back in years to come and we will be a normal family,\" Ratcliffe continued. On Wednesday, a campaign group which pushed for Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release thanked Siddiq, the family's member of parliament, for her work on the case.\"You have made a difference @TulipSiddiq! Thanks for all the amazing support you have given to #FreeNazanin over these 6 long years,\" the group wrote on Twitter.Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was first detained at a Tehran airport in April 2016 following a vacation to see her family with her daughter.Husband's hunger strikesZaghari-Ratcliffe was first detained at a Tehran airport in April 2016 following a vacation to see her family with her daughter.She was accused of working with organizations allegedly attempting to overthrow the Iranian regime and was later convicted and sentenced to five years in jail.Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her employer, the Thomson Reuters Foundation, have repeatedly denied the espionage charges against her.In April 2021 she was handed a second jail sentence and travel ban on charges of spreading propaganda against the regime, and lost an appeal on her case in October.Zaghari-Ratcliffe was given British diplomatic protection in 2019 and was designated a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International.She undertook at least three hunger strikes during her detention, one of them in a desperate bid to seek medical treatment for lumps in her breasts and numbness in her limbs. Her husband Richard Ratcliffe has also carried out hunger strikes in solidarity with his wife.The couple's daughter, Gabriella, who was just 22 months old at the time of her mother's arrest, is now almost eight.In 2019, Zaghari-Ratcliffe's supporters said she was transferred to the mental ward of a hospital in Tehran and was being denied visits from her father.In February 2020, Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family said she believed she had contracted Covid-19 in Evin Prison outside Tehran.CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali, Vasco Cotovio, Nada Bashir, Sarra Alayyan, Zeena Saifi and Lauren Said-Moorhouse contributed to this report.",

Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to discuss the grants and additional resources for HBCUs on Wednesday, a day after her husband tested positive for Covid-19. At least 57 HBCUs across the United States have received bomb threats in phone calls, e-mails, instant messages, and anonymous online posts since January, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. More than a dozen had to lock down or postpone classes on the first day of Black History Month. The FBI has said its investigating the bomb threats \"racially or ethnically motivated violent extremism and hate crimes.\" Read MoreHBCUs are now eligible to apply for funding under the Project School Emergency Response to Violence (Project SERV) program, which provides awards ranging from $50,000 to $150,000 per school, according to the Education Department. The program was created to assist institutions that have experienced a violent or traumatic incident as they work to restore \"a safe environment conducive to learning.\" Dietra Trent, executive director of the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence and Economic Opportunity through HBCUs, said the bomb threats are a \"uniquely traumatic event, given the history of bombings as a tactic to intimidate and provoke fear in Black Americans during the long struggle for civil rights in the 20th century.\" Students at Spelman College in Atlanta and Jackson State University in Mississippi told CNN last month they felt unsafe, anxious and tired of facing hatred like many generations before them.\"I think that the threats aren't individual or coincidental -- that it's a clear attack on Black students who choose to go to Black schools,\" Calvert White, a 22-year-old studying social science and education at Jackson State University, told CNN at the time.Last month, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, said he was seeking emergency funding for campus security at HBCUs after at least two institutions in the state, including Norfolk State University, were part of an alarming pattern of bomb threats. \"I am angry and deeply concerned by the recent pattern of bomb threats plaguing our Historically Black Colleges and Universities,\" the governor said.",

        "content": "(CNN)Robert Peterson struggled for months to stop thinking about the day his mother and seven other people, mostly Asian women, were shot and killed last year at Atlanta-area spas.He's found some comfort living at the Norcross, Georgia, home his mother Yong Ae Yue worked hard to own and in the memories of the many nights they played poker together, but Peterson says he can't let others forget that his family and the Asian American community see the March 16, 2021 killings as hate crimes. The gunman may have not said any racial slurs out loud during the shooting spree, but his actions \"are the proxy of his misogyny, of his racism,\" Peterson, 39, said. Since the mass shooting, the gunman has pleaded guilty to four of the killings in Cherokee County and was sentenced to life in prison. But he still faces an additional 19 charges in nearby Fulton County, where prosecutors have said they will be pursuing the death penalty for hate crimes targeting the sex and race of the victims.Ignoring this racial aspect and the longstanding objectification of Asian women has only intensified the trauma of losing his mother and fuels his fight for justice, Peterson told CNN. Read MoreAsian Americans are feeling on edge. How you can get help or help those in needThe spa killings forced a debate about racism toward the Asian community in the United States, but reports of Asian people being assaulted and harassed had already been increasing since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.A year later, not much has changed in America, according to advocates, survivors of the violence and their family members. The alleged gunman in the Atlanta attacks has not been tried in a state or federal court for a hate crime, anti-Asian racism is still continuously being reported, and challenges of proving bias against the Asian American community persist.\"We see swastikas or Nazi symbols and salutes. In the Asian American community there's  not something that unifying that everybody understands as something that's geared towards, intimidating or trying to hurt the AAPI community,\" said Byung \"BJay\" Pak, a former US attorney in Atlanta who represents Peterson.First test of the hate crimes law in GeorgiaYue, 63, and the other seven victims, Daoyou Feng, 44; Paul Michels, 54; Xiaojie \"Emily\" Tan, 49; Delaina Yaun, 33; Suncha Kim, 69; Soon Chung Park, 74; and Hyun Jung Grant, 51, were killed at three spas across the Atlanta area. Yong Ae Yue, center, was one of the eight people killed in the Atlanta spa shootings and is remembered by her sons Elliott Peterson, left, and Robert Peterson, right.Robert Aaron Long, the then-21-year-old suspect in the shootings, told authorities he was distraught due to what he described as an addiction to sex. His claim sparked a debate over the motive behind the attack as well as numerous calls in support of a hate crime designation \u2014 a trend that continues today.\"We have to tell and reckon with the whole truth of why they're not here with us today: systemic racism, White supremacy, gender-based violence, the enduring impact of war, both here and in Asia,\" Phi Nguyen, the executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice - Atlanta, said about the victims during a Saturday memorial event in Brookhaven, an Atlanta suburb.Yong Ae Yue had been working for a few months at Aromatherapy Spa in Atlanta when she was shot and killed there on March 16, 2021.The Fulton County District Attorney's Office did not respond to multiple requests for comment but a pretrial hearing is set for April 19 in Long's case.The case is expected to be the first test of the hate crimes law passed by the Georgia Legislature after the deadly shooting of 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery.  The law allows prosecutors to classify existing charges as a hate crime before trial. A  jury would first have to determine guilt, and then consider whether it's a hate crime. Pak, who also represents the family of Suncha Kim, said Long's case won't change Long's potential life in prison or death penalty sentence but it would be symbolically important.\"My wish for our clients is that they have their day in court and they get an answer for a situation that's just incomprehensible to try to bring some logic to it and to see justice done,\" Pak said.So far, federal authorities have not filed hate crimes against Long. A Justice Department spokesperson told CNN the federal investigation of the Atlanta spa shootings remains open as officials continue monitoring the state cases.Rep. Judy Chu, a California Democrat and chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus who previously was concerned that Long would not be charged with a hate crime, told CNN she was encouraged by the response of state and federal officials. Fulton County prosecutors are treating the case as a hate crime and the Justice Department \"committed to examining the evidence to see if it meets the criteria for a federal hate crime,\" Chu said.\"There is no question to me that these murders were deliberate acts of hate,\" Chu said in a statement.Robert Peterson moved to his mother's home in Norcross, Georgia, where they spent many night playing poker.'I miss the small things'As Peterson and his family await a trial, he tries not to feel the loss of his mother at every corner of their home, especially in the kitchen, where he proudly keeps the ceramic bowls and pots that his mother used to teach him how to cook his favorite dish, Kimchi-jigae, a type of traditional stew.Attacks on Asian American women are igniting a conversation about public safety\"I miss the small things. I miss her needing me to change the light bulb, update her computer, go to the store to pick up cat litter, or carry a 24-case of water,\" Peterson said. \"You know, those are the things that I wish she could ask me today.\"Yue was a traditional Korean woman, a mother who taught her biracial sons to fully embrace their Asian heritage and do good work, he says. She understood the outrage and pain after the killings of Black men and women by police, Peterson says, just as she was frightened by the rise in anti-Asian attacks at the beginning of the pandemic.\"She loved America, she loves Georgia but it was not lost on her, as most (Asian) women in America feel today, the threat of violence. It's a constant thing that is a hovering over their lives in their daily activities,\" he said.If he could talk to her today, Peterson said his mother would be proud that he's willing to speak up for her and the other victims.More Asian Americans are under attack In the year since the Atlanta spa shootings, violent assaults and harassment have left Asian Americans across the country afraid and physically hurt. One of them is Hoa Nguyen, a 68-year-old grandmother in Brooklyn who was punched in the face by a stranger on January 19 while she was on her way to the market.\"I turned my head to the right and he punched me two more time behind my ear on the left side. Then he went back to walk the way he had come,\" Nguyen said.While Nguyen, who is Vietnamese, did not suffer major injuries, she no longer feels safe walking on the streets as much as she did before, or even taking the bus or the train to visit her daughter in Brooklyn's Dumbo neighborhood.\"We've never had to look over my shoulders walking around the city and now, every time I walk outside, I'm looking over my shoulder,\" said Nguyen's son, 42-year-old Khanh Nguyen.Hoa Nguyen, right, was punched in the face on January 19, 2022 in Brooklyn, New York, police says. Her son, left, Khanh Nguyen, says the family has been harassed online since the attack.The suspect, Mercel Jackson, 51, was arrested and has been charged with assault, harassment and hate crime charges, according to the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office. He told police he \"doesn't like how Chinese people look,\" he thinks \"Chinese people look like measles,\" and \"doesn't like Chinese people looking at him,\" according to court documents.The attack led neighbors and several nonprofit organizations around New York to offer the Nguyen family their emotional and legal support, Khanh Nguyen said. Unfortunately, it sparked another type of anti-Asian hate toward the family.\"No one goes up to the streets and yells things at us but despite the sadness of these stories, you still have people going online and spewing hate towards us,\" he said.Just in New York, there were 131 incidents confirmed to have an anti-Asian bias motivation last year, according to data from the NYPD. That's a significant increase from 27 incidents reported in 2020 and one in 2019. The full scope of the violence across the nation is unclear. Statistics from advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate collected after the start of the Covid-19 pandemic suggest there have been more than 10,000 anti-Asian hate incidents in the US but the organization's data is crowdsourced, self-reported and not independently verified.But even when those incidents are reported, reaching a hate crime conviction is challenging, said Jennifer Wu, an attorney representing the Nguyens and the family of GuiYing Ma, a 61-year-old woman who was attacked in Queens by a man with a rock and who died last month. In New York, which has a hate crime penalty-enhancement law like in Georgia, the statute requires the bias to be the \"whole or substantial factor\" motivating an attack. That's a high standard, Wu says, because it \"requires you to get into the mind of the perpetrator\" and there could be more than one contributing factor, Wu says.\"The way the law has treated hate crimes is to force people to choose one reason why the hate crime is committed,\" Wu said. The law is not structured in a way that acknowledges the reality that the reason we love and hate people is for a multitude of reasons and not a single exclusive reason.\"For Peterson, who lost his mother in the Atlanta spa shootings, there was not just one reason why the victims were targeted. His mother was not just at the wrong place, at the wrong time, he said. Peterson believes the suspect had in mind their racial identity, their gender, their workplace, and what that represented to him.\"She wasn't just Asian, and she wasn't just a woman. These two are inextricably linked. She is both of these things simultaneously, and you can't separate one from the other,\" Peterson said.",

        "content": "(CNN)Sixty-two years ago, a school teacher looking for rocks in an Arizona desert made a horrific discovery: the burned remains of a young girl. Her identity was a mystery and investigators called her \"Little Miss Nobody.\" For decades, the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office in Prescott, Arizona, along with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, National Missing and Unidentified Persons System and a long list of other partners, have been working to identify the little girl. But despite multiple leads at the time, the case had remained unsolved.That girl now has a name, thanks to advanced DNA technology.Authorities identified her as Sharon Lee Gallegos during a Tuesday news conference. It is the oldest cold case the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office has resolved.Four-year-old Gallegos was abducted while playing in her grandmother's backyard in Alamagordo, New Mexico, on July 21, 1960, authorities said. She was taken by \"a couple who had been stalking her,\" according to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.Read MoreDNA can now be pulled from the very air we breathe. It could help track endangered animalsWhile \"Little Miss Nobody\" has been identified, there is still more work to be done on the case as authorities work to find out who abducted her, what happened in the days following her abduction and what led to her death. Investigators have a few leads from Gallegos' cousins, who were with her at the time of her abduction, Sheriff David Rhodes said Tuesday.Adnan Syed, subject of 'Serial' podcast, and prosecutors are requesting additional DNA testing in the case\"We as the family want to say thank you,\" Rey Chavez, Gallegos' nephew, said during the news conference. \"Thank you for what you've done for us, thank you for keeping my aunt safe and never forgetting her. It's still sinking in.\" Chavez said his family described Gallegos as a very feisty, happy-go-lucky little girl who loved playing with her cousins. Her death and disappearance left a lasting impact on his family members and, as a result, they consider themselves overprotective of the children in their family.Gallegos' remains were discovered on July 31, 1960, in Sand Creek Wash near Congress, Arizona, police said in a January Instagram post. The site is over 500 miles away from where Gallegos had been abducted.At the time, investigators determined that Gallegos' remains had been burned one to two weeks earlier. Since no further trauma was evident, the cause of death was difficult to determine and due to the suspicious nature of the case, Gallegos' death was ruled a homicide, police said. When found, Gallegos was approximately 3-foot-6 and estimated to have weighed 55 pounds, according to the National Center for Exploited and Missing Children. She had brown hair and was found wearing a checkered blouse, white shorts and adult-sized sandals that had been cut down to fit her. Her fingernails and toenails were also painted, the center said. Following the discovery of her body, the local community raised money to buy a casket and give the little girl a proper burial, the center said. \"Little Miss Nobody\" was chiseled on her headstone along with the words, \"Blessed are the pure in heart.\" Advanced DNA testing moves the needle for answersIn 2021, the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office partnered with Othram, a Texas-based laboratory that works exclusively with law enforcement, to see if advanced DNA testing could help solve the mystery of \"Little Miss Nobody.\"Othram received the case in December 2021 and returned the identity to authorities in February 2022, Dr. Kristen Mittelman, Othram's Chief Business Development Officer, told CNN.The evidence isn't always strong enough for reconstruction and building a DNA profile, Mittelman said. But improved technology means the lab can build DNA profiles that may not have been possible in the past.DNA from bite mark leads to arrest in 1994 killing of California woman, authorities say The FBI's Combined DNA Index System, also known as CODIS, is the standard technology that's used in forensic testing right now, Mittelman said. CODIS looks at 20 DNA markers and compares a person to a known database of thousands of DNA profiles of previous offenders.But that technology, which wasn't introduced until the 90s, is limited, because a child like \"Little Miss Nobody\" wouldn't be in the database since she's not a known perpetrator, Mittleman said. \"What our technology does ... is it looks at hundreds of thousands of markers and it's able to assess your identity without you being present in any database at all,\" she said.Brutal killing of a mother and son in 1994 is solved through DNA evidence, police sayExperts can solve many cases within a few weeks for $5,000 or less, Mittelman said. To help cover the costs, Othram created a network of people who care about unsolved crimes and crowdfund each case when other funding isn't available.The \"Little Miss Nobody\" case was crowdfunded in about a day, she said. \"It shows how interested people are actually finding the answer to this, and finding out who this little girl was,\" Mittelman said.Correction: An earlier version of this story had the wrong name for the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.CNN's Claudia Dominguez and Amanda Musa contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)The man arrested in connection with five separate shootings of homeless men in New York City and Washington, DC, was identified by DC authorities as Gerald Brevard. Brevard, 30, from DC, has been charged with assault with a dangerous weapon (gun), assault with intent to kill (gun), and first-degree murder while armed (gun)  for the offenses that took place in DC, Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee said at a news conference Tuesday afternoon.Authorities say they have not information about a motive at this time are not certain about any connections the suspect might have to the victims, the chief said.Additional charges for the offenses committed in New York are anticipated, the chief said. Officials there have not charged the suspect at this time.CNN was not immediately able to identify an attorney for Brevard.Read MoreOfficials in both cities announced earlier in the day that a suspect had been arrested. \"This case is an example of what happens when there is good police work, science and community support,\" Contee said. \"It's a demonstration of how quickly we can close homicide cases when all three of those things are working together.\"A gun has not been recovered as part of the investigation, Contee said. Two men died in the attacks, which unfolded between March 3 and 12. DC authorities identified one of the victims as 54-year-old Morgan Holmes. Other victims' identities have not been publicly released. Ballistics evidence linked all five shootings to the same gun, said the special agent in charge of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Washington Field Division.Two people shot, one fatally, while sleeping on New York City streets Saturday, police say\"The National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN) was particularly crucial in this investigation, allowing us to quickly match ballistic evidence connecting all five shootings to the same firearm,\" Charlie Patterson said in a statement. ATF and DC police had been investigating the three Washington shootings when two more happened in New York. A DC police captain, who is a New York native, regularly kept up with New York social media accounts and noticed a photo of a suspect who had allegedly shot a homeless person, Contee said Tuesday. The captain flagged that information to his team and they contacted New York authorities and compared the information they had.\"As we started pulling things together, our partners at the ATF tested our evidence that was recovered, they tested the evidence that was recovered in New York and we got a hit,\" the chief said.Federal officials knew the suspect's identity by midday Monday, a law enforcement official told CNN. And ATF tracked and searched for him in Washington, the source said. An ATF team found the suspect traveling on foot after he had crossed the Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge and made his way to near a gas station, where he was arrested, the official said.How the attacks unfolded-- The first shooting happened around 4 a.m. on March 3 in Washington, police there said Sunday. Officers responded to a call of shots fired and found a man suffering from apparent gunshot wounds in the 1100 block of New York Avenue Northeast. He was treated at a hospital for non-life-threatening injuries, the statement said.-- The second shooting was reported around 1:21 a.m. March 8 in the 1700 block of H Street Northeast, Washington police said. Officers found a man suffering from apparent gunshot wounds, and he was taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.-- A little after 2:50 a.m. on March 9, a DC Police member noticed a fire in the 400 block of New York Avenue Northeast. A man's remains were discovered after the flames were extinguished. Police said the cause of death was determined to be multiple stab and gunshot wounds. The victim was identified as Holmes, of no fixed address, DC police said.Police released this photo of a man suspected of shooting five homeless men in DC and New York City.-- The fourth and fifth shootings occurred in New York City early Saturday, March 12. The attacks happened about 90 minutes apart in Lower Manhattan and were caught on surveillance cameras, the New York Police Department said. Police described what the videos showed but did not release them to CNN.In one of the New York shootings, video shows a man who appears to be experiencing homelessness sleeping near the corner of King Street and Varick when an attacker approaches and shoots him in his forearm, NYPD Deputy Chief Commanding Officer Henry Sautner said Saturday. The man wakes up and shouts, \"What are you doing?\" at the shooter, who then runs away, Sautner said. The 38-year-old victim was taken to a hospital for treatment.The other New York shooting happened around 6 a.m. outside 148 Lafayette Street. There, officers found a man in a sleeping bag with gunshot wounds to his head and neck, Sautner said. He was pronounced dead at the scene.'An exceptionally heinous crime'The NYPD directed its members to do wellness checks on people who appear homeless, according to a memo obtained by CNN.\"Our homeless population is one of our most vulnerable, and an individual preying on them as they sleep is an exceptionally heinous crime,\" NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell joined DC Mayor Muriel Bowser on Monday at a news conference in Washington.The mayor of Washington stressed the need for safety for those without shelter. \"We're working very hard to have our unhoused neighbors in shelter or in housing and working through tent encampments ... so that we can provide our residents with housing and shelter,\" Bowser told Bloomberg. \"We know that this pandemic has upended a lot of our systems, our homeless system being one of them.\"CNN's Pervaiz Shallwani, Mark Morales, Evan Perez, Chris Boyette, Artemis Moshtaghian, Liam Reilly, Susannah Cullinane and Eric Levenson contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Lawyers in the case against five Guantanamo detainees accused of plotting the September 11, 2001, terror attacks are in discussions with prosecutors to reach a possible plea agreement and avoid a death penalty trial at the Guantanamo Bay military court, according to a person familiar with the matter. Legal teams on both sides of the infamous case, which includes defendant Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who's known as the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks, arrived in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, last week for scheduled pre-trial hearings. But on the first day hearings were to begin, the lead defense attorney for detainee Walid Muhammad Salih Mubarak Bin 'Attash, Cheryl Bormann, moved to withdraw from the case, the source said.  After that, the prosecution emailed all five defense teams proposing negotiations. Discussions began between the prosecution, made up of attorneys from the Department of Justice, and the five defense teams representing each Guantanamo detainee in the case on March 10. The discussions are about reaching possible plea agreements that would avoid a death penalty trial for the detainees, according to the source.\"Negotiated agreements are part of all criminal cases, and negotiations have taken place throughout the case,\" James Connell, defense attorney for detainee Ali Abdul Aziz Ali, said in a statement about the ongoing discussions. \"The process is not unusual.\" The New York Times first reported the discussions about possible plea agreements.Read MoreThe trial of the five men who are accused of plotting the September 11 attacks, initially envisioned by former President George W. Bush as a way to bring justice to 9/11 victims' families, has been stuck in bureaucratic purgatory for the better part of a decade. All five men were arraigned in 2012 during the Obama administration, but since then, the case has been in pre-trial hearings for almost 10 years. Several lawyers on both sides of the case have come and gone, and four judges have presided over the case. Much of the pre-trial debate in the case has been about how to handle the issue of torture if the case were to go to trial. All five detainees were tortured by the US government when they were held in secret CIA prisons known as \"black sites,\" in the 2000s. Their lawyers have said the men suffer from health issues because of the torture.If the legal teams were to reach a plea agreement, it would avoid a complicated and possibly long death penalty trial. The trial, if it were to happen, would take place at the military court at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay.President Joe Biden has said he intends to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. Department of Defense deputy press Secretary Todd Breasseale would not comment on the ongoing discussions, but said a resolution of the military commission process through \"negotiated settlement\" would contribute to the Biden administration's goal of closing the prison.\"The Administration is committed to the responsible closure of the detention center at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Resolution of the military commission process through trial or by negotiated settlement contributes to that goal,\" Breasseale said in a statement to CNN. \"It would be inappropriate to comment on any settlement negotiations.\"There are 38 detainees still held at the prison.",

Information on charges against Gary Cabana, 60, will be announced pending his extradition to New York, a New York Police Department spokesperson said. Cabana was arrested at a Greyhound station early Tuesday after police found him sleeping on a bench inside a station in Chinatown, according to the Philadelphia Police Department. It's unclear whether Cabana has an attorney. The injured employees were both 24 years old, police said. One, a woman, suffered two stab wounds to the lower back and one stab wound to the back of her neck. The other, a man, was stabbed once in the left collar bone, officials said.Read MoreBoth were rushed to Bellevue Hospital and are expected to survive, police said at a news conference Saturday evening. Here's what we know about Cabana: He visited museum regularly, officials sayPolice said he was a regular visitor to the museum. Immediately after the incident, police described him as wearing a black jacket and surgical mask.That description was released immediately over division radio units in the area and a search was initiated by police responding to the scene, according to NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence and Counterterrorism John Miller.He was caught on video leaving the museum, so police knew which direction he went.Cabana is known to the NYPD, Miller said, and was wanted by the department in connection with two incidents that occurred in Midtown Manhattan, where the museum is located, prior to the double stabbing. He is also allegedly linked to an arson incident at a Best Western in Philadelphia, where a small fire was extinguished in a fifth-floor hotel room Monday evening, according to police there. New York Mayor Eric Adams said he was briefed on the incident there on Saturday and his press secretary tweeted it \"appears to be an isolated, criminal incident.\"The NYPD released a series of photos of the man suspected in two stabbings at MoMA Saturday.The suspect became angry when denied entry, police sayCabana entered the museum with the intention of attending a film, police said.New York's Museum of Modern Art evacuated after two people were stabbed inside, police say \"At approximately 4:15 this afternoon, an individual entered the museum, attempted to gain entrance presenting his membership card and was denied entrance because his membership had expired,\" Miller said Saturday. \"His membership had expired as a result of two incidents involving disorderly conduct here at the museum on two separate dates in recent days,\" he added.Upon being denied entrance, the suspect became angry, jumped over the reception desk and attacked the two employees, police said.There was ample security in the area at the time of the incident, but Miller described it as a \"rapidly unfolding spontaneous incident.\"Patrons evacuated the museum in a panicIn videos shared on social media, dozens of people are seen leaving the museum in a large crowd.  \"We weren't told what was going on, just that they had to close the exhibits immediately,\" MoMA patron Tina Rook told CNN. \"A woman did say it was an emergency,\" Rook said, adding the whole incident was handled very well by police and museum officials.    In a series of tweets, MoMA patron Yuichi Shimada described a chaotic scene, saying there were \"many police vehicle and ambulances.\"\"It seemed that everyone had been ordered to evacuate, and the other guests came out one after another,\" Shimada tweeted.\"It was chaotic, partly because it was snowing, with a group of young women in a panic and crying, and partly because people were taking pictures on their cell phones and playing live on their phones too,\" Shimada said.pic.twitter.com/XcutyzypMz\u2014 Yuichi Shimada \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\u30e1\u30ac\u30cd\u5c4b\ud83e\udd13 (@kinaizm) March 12, 2022\n\nMoMA temporarily closes, suspends screeningsThe museum was closed for the rest of the weekend and on Sunday, said it would reopen Tuesday.\"Thank you for your incredible support,\" a tweet from the museum said.The facility was due to screen the films \"Paper Moon,\" \"Wattstax,\" \"Bringing Up Baby\" and \"Cutting Horse\" Saturday.On its website Monday, MoMA showed all film showings at the venue canceled until Thursday.",

Police said body camera footage shows Toledo holding a gun in his right hand, but it vanishes from sight as he turns toward the officer and begins to raise his hands as he's shot. A gun was later found behind a fence a few feet from where Toledo was killed.Attorneys Adeena Weiss Ortiz and Joel Hirschhorn, who represent the family of Adam Toledo, said they and the family were \"profoundly disappointed.\"\"Despite that decision, we will continue fighting for Adam and have filed our civil complaint seeking monetary damages,\" they said in a news release. \"Officer (Eric) Stillman's use of deadly force was excessive and posed a threat to the safety of Adam and others. We will be contacting the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division to address this horrific travesty.\"Read MorePair of recent Chicago police killings puts spotlight on policies related to officer foot pursuitsFoxx noted that while it may be determined that Stillman violated the Chicago Police Department's foot chase policies, a decision on criminal charges made by the Cook County State's Attorney's Office \"must be rooted in the calculus of whether officer Stillman's perception of whether he was in danger of imminent harm, which caused him to ... fatally shoot Adam Toledo was reasonable given the totality of the circumstances around the incident.\"Chicago police had responded almost immediately to a notification from ShotSpotter, a gunshot detection system that alerts officers to gunfire. The responding officers were informed that eight shots had been fired, according to police radio traffic released by authorities, and encountered Toledo fleeing in an alley before running after him.'Insufficient' evidence in Alvarez shootingAlvarez, 22, was fatally shot by officer Evan Solano -- 10 miles from where Toledo was killed -- on March 31, 2021, after he ran from police. Chicago police say he was armed during the case, and surveillance footage shows him dropping what appears to be a gun onto the grass nearby as he was shot by an officer.\"After a thorough review, the office has concluded that the evidence in this case is insufficient to support criminal charges against police officer Evan Solano,\" Foxx said. \"As in the Toledo case, an officer is justified in using force likely to cause death or great bodily harm when he reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or such other person,\" she said. Body camera footage released last year by Chicago's Civilian Office of Police Accountability (COPA) shows responding officers chasing Alvarez by car, and then on foot in a residential neighborhood in northwest Chicago on March 31, 2021. Police said at the time they were attempting to stop and speak with Alvarez, who was \"an individual familiar to the officers,\" according to COPA. Police did not say at the time whether Alvarez was suspected of a crime or what they wanted to speak with him about.In the footage, an officer is heard saying, \"Drop the gun!\" twice. Less than a second later, he fires five times. The shooting is visible from both the officer's body camera video and a nearby home video surveillance camera. \"Why are you shooting me?\" Alvarez yells from the ground. Alvarez was later pronounced dead from multiple gunshot wounds.Body camera footage showed two officers later acknowledging that a handgun was on the grass near Alvarez.A call to attorneys representing Alvarez' family for comment was not immediately returned Tuesday. 'Trust must be a two-way street'Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said every shooting death is a tragedy and the city needs to continue to support the families and communities of Toledo and Alvarez. She added that trust is a two-way street for city residents and police officers.\"Following today's announcement ... that work to build that trust continues, in partnership with the Chicago Office for Police Accountability and our Chicago Police Department,\" she said.The city is committed to reform, including a new foot pursuit policy and the creation of a new civilian police oversight body.",

The victim, a 67-year-old Asian woman, was returning home Friday evening when she saw the suspect, whom police identified as Tammel Esco, 42, in front of her building. Esco allegedly used the racial slur as she passed him, police said in the release.Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, thousands of people in the US have been victims of anti-Asian incidents, from verbal abuse to physical attacks. From March 19, 2020, to December 31, 2021, a total of 10,905 hate incidents against Asian American and Pacific Islander people were reported to Stop AAPI Hate, an organization that tracks reports of racism and discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Read More In the Friday incident, the victim ignored Esco and entered the vestibule of her apartment building, according to the police. But as she attempted to open the second door to enter the lobby, Esco allegedly approached her from behind and punched her in the head, knocking her to the floor, the release said. The department provided surveillance a video of the assault. Asian Americans are feeling on edge. How you can get help or help those in need In it, a man is seen punching a woman in both the head and face more than 125 times and then stomping her with his foot seven times.

She was taken to a trauma center and is listed in stable condition, according to police. Police responded to the scene at around 6:11 p.m. Friday, found Esco outside the apartment building and placed him into custody without incident, according to the release.  He was arraigned in a Yonkers City Court on Saturday and held in custody at Westchester County Jail, the release said.  Esco is charged with two felonies -- attempted murder and assault in the second degree involving a victim 65 or older -- online court records show.Each count is charged as a hate crime, according to the release.

        "content": "Washington (CNN)Eligible adults in Ohio will soon be able to carry a concealed handgun without a license or training following legislation signed into law Monday night by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine.Gun rights groups and GOP legislators argue that the new law, set to take effect in mid-June, removes costs and barriers for law-abiding people to exercise their constitutional right to bear arms and for self-defense, while critics argue that it will increase gun violence. When stopped by police, a person will no longer have to \"promptly inform\" the officer that they're carrying a concealed handgun, though they will have to disclose that they have a concealed handgun when an officer asks them.The law also lowers the penalty for not telling a police officer about a concealed handgun from a first-degree misdemeanor to a second-degree misdemeanor and does not allow a police officer to arrest a person solely because they didn't promptly show their concealed carry license.People who had violated the prior notification requirements may also apply to have their record expunged. Read MoreFor those who want to obtain the concealed carry license, current Ohio law requires eight hours of training, including two hours of in-person training, to obtain a concealed carry license. Concealed carry applicants apply with their county sheriff and must pay a minimum fee of $67 for a background check and license. Once in effect, the new law will still allow Ohioans to apply for concealed carry permits, but undergoing training and background check to legally carry a concealed handgun will be optional. \"Nowhere in the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution does it say you have to have training to defend yourself or to bear arms,\" Republican state Sen. Terry Johnson, who sponsored Senate Bill 215, said last fall.Proponents of the law, including the National Rifle Association and the Buckeye Firearms Association, say that people still apply and pay for permits and training. Along with gun safety advocates, law enforcement, including Fraternal Order of Police of Ohio and the Ohio Association of Chiefs of Police, opposed the bill, particularly its modification of the \"duty to notify,\" arguing that it threatens officers' safety.Other gun safety advocates, including Moms Demand Action, and Dion Green, a survivor of the 2019 shooting in Dayton that killed his father Derrick R. Fudge and eight other victims, testified in opposition to the bill. The legislation passed the Republican-led Ohio state legislature earlier this month on near party-line votes. In the wake of the 2019 shooting in Dayton, DeWine announced proposals to address gun violence, such as a \"red flag\" law and called on lawmakers to pass a law requiring background checks on all firearm sales. DeWine, who is up for reelection this year, also signed legislation in January that expands where a person has no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense.Several other states have been forging ahead with permitless carry policies despite the opposition from law enforcement and amid a rise in gun violence and homicides continues across the country.The law that DeWine signed makes Ohio the 23rd state to enact permitless carry, after Alabama's Republican governor signed similar legislation last week.",

The suspect, whom the SBU did not identify, was accused of being on \"thousands\" of phone calls to Russian officials, including senior military officers and of sending text messages to Ukrainian officials suggesting that they surrender. The equipment seized was used to route Ukrainian mobile phone traffic to Russian networks, according to Victor Zhora, a senior cybersecurity official in the Ukrainian government. It's the latest development in the ongoing battle for communications networks in Ukraine as the Russian military continues to shell the capital of Kyiv. From Moscow to the front lines of the war in Ukraine, the ability to communicate to troops and citizens alike has been contested by suspected Russian and pro-Ukrainian hackers.Hackers last week caused outages at a Ukrainian internet service provider Triolan, which has customers in major cities. Triolan blamed \"the enemy,\" a reference to Russia, but did not provide evidence supporting that claim.Russia's cyber offensive against Ukraine has been limited so far. Experts are divided on whyCarmine Cicalese, former chief of cyberspace and information operations at US Army headquarters, said functional mobile phone networks are of particular importance to non-military personnel in Ukraine who are taking up arms against Russia and who do not have access to tactical communications equipment. Read MoreMore broadly, in war the ability to be able to communicate with friends and family is \"vital to maintaining morale,\" Cicalese, who is now president of cybersecurity firm Cyber Cic, LLC, told CNN. In a separate incident, satellite modems that provide internet service for tens of thousands of customers in Europe, including some in Ukraine, were taken offline in a cyberattack on February 24, around the time that Russian forces began attacking Ukraine, an official from the US telecommunications provider Viasat, which owns the affected network, told CNN. Zhora, the Ukrainian official who works at the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection, told reporters Tuesday that the satellite hack \"was a really huge loss in communications in the very beginning of the war.\"The hack of the Viasat satellite network was a \"deliberate, isolated and external cyber event\" that a third-party cybersecurity firm and \"government partners\" are investigating, Viasat said in a statement.Chris Phillips, spokesperson for Viasat, told CNN in an email that the KA-SAT, the Viasat satellite network targeted in the hack, had been \"stabilized.\" Phillips declined to specify how many customers had been affected by the incident, calling it a \"partial outage.\"Reuters first reported on the scope of the Viasat hack and the US investigation.The US government is investigating the hack of Viasat as a potential Russian state-sponsored cyberattack, a US official familiar with the matter told CNN. The US National Security Agency is \"aware of reports of a potential cyber-attack that disconnected thousands of very small-aperture terminals that receive data to and from a satellite network,\" an NSA spokesperson told CNN. \"We continue to work with interagency partners and Allies to assess the scope and severity of the incident and make available any relevant expertise we possess.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)A massive spending bill that will fund the federal government through September -- as well as provide $13.6 billion in fresh aid to Ukraine as the country fights back against Russia's invasion -- was signed into law by President Joe Biden Tuesday. The spending package, known as the omnibus, will provide funding through fiscal year 2022, which started in October. Lawmakers have been negotiating over the legislation for months and have passed three stopgap funding bills to keep the government running in the meantime. That means federal agencies have been funded at 2021 levels for the past five months. The text of the 2,741-page bill was released last week. Congress had to pass the legislation, or another stopgap bill, by midnight last Friday to avoid a government shutdown. The House passed the bill on Wednesday night and the Senate passed the bill on Thursday evening. The spending package calls for more than $1.5 trillion in annual appropriations, excluding the Ukraine aid. That's more than a 6% increase from the year before, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The legislation will provide $730 billion in non-defense funding -- a 6.7% increase over fiscal year 2021 -- the largest jump in four years, according to the House Appropriations Committee. It also will provide $782 billion in defense funding, a 5.6% increase over fiscal year 2021.Read MoreHere's what some of the money will fund, according to summaries and fact sheets provided by the House Appropriations Committee:Increases for congressional offices, staff and policeThe law calls for an increase in funding for congressional offices by 21%, to $774.4 million, so they can recruit and retain a diverse workforce. It will be the largest boost in the Members Representational Allowance appropriation since its authorization in 1996. The package will also provide $18.2 million to pay interns.It will provide $602.5 million for the Capitol Police, an increase of $87 million. This will allow for the hiring of up to 2,112 sworn officers and 450 civilian members of the Capitol Police.A boost for the IRSThe spending package will provide $12.6 billion for the Internal Revenue Service, an increase of $675 million, the largest since 2001. The funding boost is intended to help the IRS improve its customer service, increase enforcement, modernize its technology and improve its web applications. It also will provide special funding transfer authority and direct hire authority to help the agency deal with a massive backlog of returns and correspondence.  Money for election securityThe package will provide $75 million for election security grants to bolster state efforts to improve the security and integrity of elections for federal office. It also will give the Election Assistance Commission $20 million for operating expenses, a boost of $3 million.Schools and financial aid boostThe law will provide $17.5 billion for high-poverty K-12 schools, an increase of $1 billion, the largest in more than a decade. And it calls for increasing funding for Head Start by $289 million to $11 billion.The maximum Pell Grant will increase by $400, to $6,895 a year. Pell Grants are generally awarded to undergraduate students with exceptional financial needs, and the amounts are based on their costs to attend school, family sizes and incomes. The increase will be the largest to the maximum Pell Grant in more than a decade, according to a summary of the bill. The Build Back Better package, which passed the House last year but stalled in the Senate, had called for increasing the maximum Pell Grant award by $550. Funds for medical research and public healthThe package will provide more funding for biomedical and behavioral research at the National Institutes of Health, which will receive $45 billion in funding, an increase of $2.25 billion. It will include $1 billion to establish the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health in order to speed up the pace of scientific breakthroughs for diseases such as ALS, Alzheimer's, diabetes and cancer.It will send $8.5 billion to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an increase of $582 million. And it will invest in the nation's public health infrastructure and public health and behavioral health initiatives, including $83 million for safe motherhood and infant health, an increase of $20 million, and nearly $212 million for mental health resources for children and youth, an increase of $25 million.Unlocks new infrastructure investmentThe passage of the spending bill will allow the release of some of the funding authorized by the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which passed in November.Due to a budgeting quirk, some of the money could not be spent until the fiscal year 2022 appropriations measure is signed into law. The restriction affects a portion of the funds slated for the federal highway program and public transit programs, for example. Renews the Violence Against Women ActThe law renews the Violence Against Women Act, which expired in 2018, by increasing funding for its prevention and prosecution programs, as well as efforts to reduce the backlog of unprocessed rape kits, according to a fact sheet. Child nutrition programsThe package will provide $26.9 billion in funding for child nutrition programs, an increase of $1.77 billion above what was approved for fiscal year 2021. However, the spending law does not extend the pandemic waivers that provide schools with extra federal funds and increased flexibilities to cope with Covid-19 outbreaks, as well as supply chain and labor issues. A one-year extension of the waivers, which Congress originally approved in March 2020, would have cost $11 billion.The law will also authorize funds so that more fruits and vegetables can be included in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children food packages. More housing aidThe Department of Housing and Urban Development will get an increase of $4 billion over the previous year, for a total of $53.7 billion, according to a summary. Some of the funds will create 25,000 new Housing Choice Vouchers for low-income individuals and families at risk of homelessness, including survivors of domestic violence and veterans. Eligible people can use the vouchers to find their own housing and pay rent. Cybersecurity protectionThe spending package will increase funding for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency by $568.7 million, for a total of $2.6 billion to prevent cyberattacks and protect critical infrastructure and communications systems, according to a fact sheet. Closing a vaping loopholeA provision in the law targets vaping products that remained on the market despite growing efforts to clamp down on flavors that are especially popular among young people. It will move synthetic nicotine under the US Food and Drug Administration's authority, according to an announcement Wednesday by Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat.While the FDA has authority over tobacco products, some companies have made their own synthetic nicotine in the lab. Because synthetic nicotine doesn't come from tobacco, companies have managed to circumvent the agency's oversight and keep their flavored products on shelves.DefenseSpending on defense and national security makes up more than half of the spending package. The measure calls for an increase in funds for military personnel, operations, research and the purchase of ground vehicles, aircraft, ships, munition and other equipment, according to a summary. Ukraine aidThe $13.6 billion would provide additional humanitarian, security and economic assistance for Ukraine and allies in the region. Roughly half of the aid package would be used to deploy troops to the region and send defense equipment to Ukraine, according to a summary of the bill provided by the House Appropriations Committee.The US has deployed thousands of troops throughout Europe, both before and during Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But putting troops on the ground in Ukraine, which is not a member of NATO, is a line that the US and its Western allies have not been willing to cross.Much of the other half of the aid would provide humanitarian support for refugees fleeing Ukraine and people displaced within the country, including emergency food assistance, as well as help to respond to the economic needs in Ukraine and neighboring countries, such as cybersecurity and energy issues.What's not in the bill? Covid-19 reliefThe bill text originally included $15.6 billion to fund the government's Covid-19 response efforts in the US and around the world, including research and development of treatments and vaccines.But the funding was stripped from the bill in a last-minute effort to lock down votes last week. Republicans had pushed for the money to be offset by previously approved Covid-19 relief funds for state governments that had yet to be used, but many Democrats raised objections about the way those offsets were structured.Instead, House Appropriations Chair Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, introduced a stand-alone bill with the Covid-19 response funds. But it's unlikely that the separate package would get the 60 votes needed to pass the Senate.This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys, will remain in jail as he awaits trial, a federal judge decided on Tuesday.The Justice Department had argued Tarrio, if released, would be a danger to the community, pointing to his leadership of the far-right group from afar during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and pride in their destructiveness.\"January 6 has passed, but there's no reason to think that Enrique Tarrio is done planning another incident,\" prosecutor Jason McCullough said in court Tuesday in Miami. An FBI agent testified in court as well.\"Based on the compelling evidence of Tarrio's leadership of this conspiracy, there are no conditions of release that can reasonably assure the safety of the community or the defendant's appearance in court. And based on Tarrio's public comments aimed at chilling witnesses against his co-conspirators, as well as his own purported efforts to evade law enforcement, he poses a risk of obstructing justice should he be released,\" the department said in a filing in federal court.Magistrate Judge Lauren Louis of the Southern District of Florida agreed with the DOJ's warnings, noting there was also a threat that he could flee, after being charged with criminal conspiracy as an alleged planner of the January 6 attack of the Capitol.Read MoreDefense attorney Nayib Hassan asked the judge to be released, citing close family ties and ties to the community. Several of Tarrio's family members attended the hearing in Miami, which lasted nearly three hours, and some relatives offered their homes as collateral for his bond. Tarrio's defense attorney said after the hearing he was \"disappointed\" in the judge's decision and might appeal the ruling at a hearing scheduled for next week in Washington, DC.Tarrio's case will now move to the federal court in Washington, DC, for further proceedings. Five co-defendants of Tarrio who are also linked to the Proud Boys have pleaded not guilty.Tarrio told group 'do it again'Prosecutors specifically highlighted Tarrio texting in an encrypted message chat on January 6: \"They'll fear us doing it again,\" after claiming, \"We did this,\" about the Capitol attack. When a member of the group asked what to do next, Tarrio responded, \"Do it again.\"Monday's filing also revealed a new detail about an alleged meeting Tarrio had with Stewart Rhodes, the founder of the Oath Keepers, and others at a parking garage in Washington, DC, on January 5. Rhodes and other Oath Keepers are facing seditious conspiracy charges in a separate January 6 case.While in the garage, Tarrio told a person, who was not identified, that he had wiped all messages on his phone and had a two-factor authentication set up to make his phone difficult to access for others, the Justice Department said. Tarrio is the latest high-profile defendant indicted by the Justice Department in its sweeping investigation of January 6. He was added to an existing case against several other Proud Boys leaders and a man that the Justice Department believes was the first person to break into a Senate-side window, allowing the crowd to surge toward elected officials inside. Other Proud Boys members in the case are detained awaiting trial.Prosecutors said in their filing on Monday that Tarrio is accused of a serious criminal conspiracy, stating that \"the danger posed by this plot shows an extreme disregard for the safety of the community and the laws of the United States.\"Tarrio was previously arrested and served jail time for destroying a church's Black Lives Matter banner in downtown DC. He was not in the city on January 6, having been ordered by a judge to leave because of his arrest days before.Prosecutors described how Tarrio, after leaving DC on January 4, stayed in communication with a rally planning group within the Proud Boys called the Ministry of Self Defense, or MOSD. Their first event, according to prosecutors, was the January 6 Donald Trump rally in Washington, and Tarrio sent the group a voice message on January 4 acknowledging they wanted to \"storm the Capitol.\"\"Tarrio directed and orchestrated the MOSD's violent acts entirely remotely -- using encrypted media and social media in the weeks leading up to January 6, and on the day itself, to organize, direct, and celebrate the success of a criminal conspiracy to obstruct the Certification of the Electoral College vote,\" prosecutors wrote.

Of the total 164,973 encounters -- which includes people who approached ports of entry along the US-Mexico border -- 30% had previously tried to cross the border within the last year. A Trump-era pandemic emergency rule that allows border authorities to turn away migrants, including asylum seekers, at the border remains in effect for adults and families. There were 91,513 expulsions of migrants under the policy in February, the data shows. \"February also registered a slight uptick in the number of encounters along the Southwest border, with most individuals arriving from Mexico and the Northern Triangle, and the majority of noncitizens expelled under Title 42,\" said US Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Chris Magnus.

        "content": "(CNN)Almost three weeks into Russian President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine, harrowing images of bloodied pregnant women and children emerging from an obliterated hospital in Mariupol have shocked the world. Congress is now considering a resolution to investigate the Russian invaders for possible war crimes. JUST WATCHEDStriking video from above shows devastation in Ukraine city where 2,500 are deadReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHStriking video from above shows devastation in Ukraine city where 2,500 are dead 01:01In an email interview with CNN Opinion, Michael A. Newton, an expert on war crimes, argues that such an investigation is justified due to the attacks on civilians.He is a professor of the practice of law and professor of the practice of political science at Vanderbilt University. Newton served as the senior adviser to the Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues in the US State Department from 1999 to 2002. He also helped negotiate the International Criminal Court Elements of Crimes. The views expressed in this commentary are his own.This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and flow.A Ukrainian serviceman exits a damaged building after shelling in Kyiv, on March 12, 2022. Let's start with the basics -- what constitutes a war crime? Read MoreAccording to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, a war crime is any act by which combatants and commanders fail to ensure respect for the civilian population, or illegally subject civilian objects to hostilities. Many other duties flow from this baseline, such as warning civilian populations \"unless circumstances do not permit\" and obligations to take \"all feasible precautions\" to minimize harm to civilian lives or property.War crimes law relies on the foundational principle that fighters must \"at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants -- and between civilian objects and military objectives, and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives.\"The laws of war apply in Ukraine because the Russian invasion is real. Despite the Russian label of the war as a \"special military operation,\" the Geneva Conventions on armed conflicts apply \"even if the state of war is not recognized\" by Russian officials. Based on that definition, have we seen this already in Ukraine?A record 41 other states have asked the International Criminal Court (ICC) to formally investigate crimes committed inside Ukraine because there is \"reasonable basis\" to believe that Russian forces are committing war crimes. The list of possible charges grows daily. Karim Khan, the ICC prosecutor, observed that \"if attacks are intentionally directed against the civilian population: that is a crime. If attacks are intentionally directed against civilian objects: that is a crime. ... There is no legal justification, there is no excuse, for attacks which are indiscriminate, or which are disproportionate in their effects on the civilian population.\" Attacks aimed at demoralizing civilians are war crimes because civilian morale is never a legitimate military target. Russians have been accused of launching attacks inside the boundaries of the designated humanitarian corridors. Targeting of humanitarian convoys or relief operations providing food, water and medicine may constitute the crime of intentionally using starvation as a method of warfare. What role should the US play in documenting war crimes in Ukraine?  The US Senate should confirm President Joe Biden's nominee for US Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice, Beth Van Schaack, by voice vote immediately. The ambassador has a vital role in coordinating US government efforts to document war crimes in a granular legal sense. In war crime trials, prosecutors must have sufficient evidence to convict perpetrators beyond reasonable doubt based on their individual responsibility. The ambassador coordinates allied efforts, much as the UN War Crimes Commission facilitated prosecutions in Nuremberg after the Second World War. If bombing a children's hospital isn't crossing a red line -- what is?The Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice represents an important voice within the State Department and interagency, and Van Schaack's leadership would help ensure success for the new joint US-EU project documenting war crimes. Prosecution of Russian leaders, oligarchs and commanders for crimes in Ukraine must be a \"whole of the Free World\" approach. Brave Ukrainian lawyers are doing their part, and we should support them.American leadership provides the centripetal force to consolidate documentation efforts and incorporate the rapidly coalescing array of private documentation efforts. Investigations will also provide corroborating evidence to refute Russian propaganda and legal distortions. What role did you play in the prosecution of Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic in the 1990s? I stood at the border of Kosovo with the first Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues (the previous name for this ambassadorship), David Scheffer, to help document the crimes later charged against Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107. We were eyewitnesses to the more than 20,000 Kosovar-Albanians who fled the murders committed in Pristina within a few days. Serbs forced them onto trains and sent them across the border, down tracks with landmines laid on either side and with snipers ready to murder those who stepped out of line. This led to an unprecedented effort to document atrocities in near real time. Unlike the current Office of Global Criminal Justice, we reported directly to the US Secretary of State, and we took the FBI into Kosovo to assist investigations benefiting the Hague Tribunal. These efforts buttressed many cases, in addition to Milosevic's. Who would decide if any Russian leader is to be held responsible for war crimes?Russian commanders, oligarchs and leaders may be prosecuted for ordering, committing or assisting war crimes. The law of command responsibility also criminalizes those who \"knew or should have known\" of crimes and failed to take necessary and reasonable measures to discipline the forces under their \"effective control.\" The judges of each case assess the legal basis for every charge. Because the Geneva Conventions grant broad criminal jurisdiction to sovereign states, domestic officials may prosecute war criminals found on their territory, too. The ICC treaty permits charges against senior leaders because it applies \"equally to all persons without any distinction based on official capacity.\" It adds that a person's capacity as head of state does not exempt them from criminal responsibility.  How realistic is it that they would be tried in a courtroom?Russian leaders should feel deep disquiet in the face of a deeply entrenched body of precedents since the Second World War. Prosecuting those responsible for crimes committed in Ukraine conforms with patterns of international criminal justice that include many defendants who thought that they were above the law. Putin's bombs aren't weakening Ukraine's resolve to fightThe presidents, prime ministers, defense officials, military commanders and staff officers who have been brought to book represent a litany of infamy. Defendants included Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, former Liberian President Charles Taylor, former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, former Rwandan Prime Minister Jean Kambanda, former Rwandan General Augustin Bizimungu -- and many others. These cases are the common heritage of mankind. However, the ICC cannot prosecute the crime of aggression conducted by Russian leaders against Ukraine -- in part because Russia is not a state party to the ICC. We should instead work with our EU allies and/or the UN to establish a \"New Nuremberg\" empowered to adjudicate aggression-based offenses -- minus Russian judges of course.What can we learn from other war crimes trials?These trials are inherently complex. They take more time to investigate and prosecute than victims would like. Proceedings must be based on compilation of evidence and procedural regularity absent overtones of political retribution. During the trial of Saddam Hussein, the judge rebuked one lawyer, saying \"you are a legal man in a court of law, not a circus.\" No war criminals should develop complacency about escaping accountability because atrocity crimes are unconstrained by statutes of limitations.Prosecutors exercise discretion based on actual evidence rather than polemics. Careful lawyering is the key. The sensational nature of charges requires close coordination with civil society and victims' organizations. The Congress of Vienna, which reorganized Europe after the Napoleonic wars, termed Napoleon Bonaparte \"Enemy and Disturber of the tranquility of the World.\" Russian leaders are no less deserving of that title, yet political speech will help bring justice only when it is translated into binding legal opinion.Even if no Russian leaders could be easily convicted, why would it still be worth pursuing charges?The United States has a moral imperative to help Ukraine win the war that Russia brought to its citizenry. As the ICC came into existence, American diplomats promised that the US would not \"retreat from its leadership role in the promotion of international justice and the rule of law.\" We must uphold that promise. Indeed, coordinated efforts to restore the rule of law are necessary to augment financial sanctions. In the world's first military treatise, ancient Chinese general, military strategist and philosopher Sun Tz\u016d wrote that \"to fight and conquer in all your battles is not the supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.\" Get our free weekly newsletterSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter.Join us on Twitter and FacebookIn upholding the law of war, our efforts will reclaim the initiative from the Russian aggressors.

        "content": "(CNN)On a Friday evening in November 2018, 40-year-old Scott Beierle signed up for a hot yoga class in Tallahassee, Florida, and told the receptionist he would wait outside. When the class began, Beierle grabbed his ear protection and a loaded gun, walked into the classroom and opened fire. He killed two women, injured four others and then turned the gun on himself. Police, through the course of their investigation of the incident, discovered a long history of hatred toward women, sexual assault allegations, and homophobic and racist comments. Now, threat assessment experts with the US Secret Service's National Threat Assessment Center are using the Tallahassee murder-suicide to bring greater understanding to the threat posed by so-called involuntarily celibate men, often referred to as \"incels.\"\"The term 'incel' is often used to describe men who feel unable to obtain romantic or sexual relationships with women, to which they feel entitled,\" according to researchers in a new case study report released Tuesday.Read More\"This attacker's history highlights the specific threat posed by misogynistic extremism,\" researchers wrote in the case study. \"This gender-based ideology, sometimes referred to as 'male supremacy' has received increased attention in recent years from researchers, government agencies and advocacy groups due to its association with high-profile incidents of mass violence.\"The detailed review of Beierle's history illustrated common behavioral patterns and highlights many opportunities for intervention. \"The behavioral history of the Hot Yoga Tallahassee attacker illustrates many of the behavioral threat assessment themes identified through years of U.S. Secret Service research examining targeted violence,\" the report states.The Secret Service's report showed Beierle had regularly written about and engaged in violence toward women. \"The Hot Yoga Tallahassee attacker was motivated to carry out violence by his inability to develop or maintain relationships with women, along with his perception of women's societal power over men,\" said Steven Driscoll, the assistant director of the National Threat Assessment Center.Beierle's behavioral history, the report said, \"highlights the specific threat posed by misogynistic extremism.\" One theme the report points to is Beierle facing a lack of consequences. For example, the report notes that he had been charged multiple times with battery, but charges were dropped. Other behavior threat assessment themes the Secret Service identified included failed aspirations, lack of financial stability, bizarre behavior, harassment and homicidal ideations.The number of mass casualty events such as school shootings and misogynistically motivated murders in recent years has prompted a dramatic increase in requests for training from the Secret Service, researchers said. Lina Alathari, the chief of the National Threat Assessment Center, estimated the number of participants in threat assessment and targeted violence trainings topped 26,000 last year. Researchers noted that Beierle's behavior was extreme and reflected a combination of misogyny and White supremacy, highlighting the need for more studies on male supremacy as a motivating ideology.\"You often see a crossover between misogynistic views and White supremacy, far-right ideology, as well as in some cases far-left ideologies,\" Driscoll said. \"The body of research examining misogyny as an extreme ideology and incels specifically, as well as its intersection with other ideologies like White supremacy, as a field of research, is growing.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Four Houston Police Department officers who were indefinitely suspended in September 2020 in the deadly shooting of Nicolas Chavez will be reinstated, according to the department's police chief.One sergeant and three officers had appealed the suspension that followed the shooting of an apparently emotionally disturbed man who was on the ground, wounded and incapacitated, before a final barrage of 21 shots.HPD Chief Troy Finner announced in a news conference Monday the city was unable to prove each officer violated the rules and policies cited in their suspension. Therefore, Finner said, an arbitrator ruled the officers must be reinstated.  Although he was not the final decision maker, Finner said he believes when the officers were indefinitely suspended there was evidence of policy violations. Then-police chief Art Acevedo said at the time the four officers were fired, but a police spokesperson said Monday the officers had been indefinitely suspended.Read More\"I'm disgusted,\" Leantha Chavez, Nicolas Chavez's mother, said in an interview with CNN on Monday. \"My son was murdered by them and they know it.\"\"These men are getting their jobs back just so they can do it again,\" she said. \"They are supposed to help us, not hurt us.\"A frame grab from the bodycam footage released by the Houston Police Department. Body camera footage was released by policeHPD officials released graphic bodycam video showing the incident that ultimately led to the suspension, CNN previously reported. The incident started with several 911 calls about an apparently emotionally disturbed man jumping in front of cars and entering backyards.Acevedo said toxicology tests revealed Chavez had methamphetamine, amphetamine and ethanol in his system when he died.Edited body camera footage showed the officers initially repeatedly pleaded with the man to surrender.\"Hey, bud, we're here to help you, man,\" one officer is heard saying.Houston Police Officers' Union officials at the time said the encounter lasted about 15 minutes, during which the officers attempted to de-escalate the incident by retreating, firing bean bags and using Tasers on the man before resorting to lethal force when he pointed a stun gun at them.Joe Gamaldi, union president and also national vice president of the Fraternal Order of Police, tamped down speculation the incident was racially motivated. Chavez was Latino, he said. Three of the officers are Latino and the fourth is married to a Latina.\"It was clear ... these officers did not want to shoot Mr. Chavez and did everything in their power not to,\" Gamaldi told reporters.Acevedo had said even after repeated verbal warnings, the deployment of multiple soft impact rounds and Tasers, Chavez was still \"armed with a metal object and began moving quickly toward\" the officer who fired the first two shots. He also called the barrage of gunfire at the end unreasonable.Chavez's father, Joaqu\u00edn Chavez, told CNN at the time his son had struggled with depression and anxiety but didn't know what his son was going through the night died. \"He had his issues. He went through a lot. I just don't understand,\" he said. \"I don't think I'll ever find out why he was out on the street that night.\"A grand jury failed to indict the officers last year on charges related to the shooting, according to CNN affiliate KTRK.Officers will be retrained, chief saysThe four officers will receive back pay for the time they were suspended and will need of training, according to Finner.\"They've been away from the department almost two years, and there will be reintegration training -- also additional training, just as any other officers who are involved in critical incidents,\" Finner said. In a statement emailed to CNN, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said, \"I reviewed the video shortly after the shooting of Mr. Chavez and was disturbed by what I saw. The city dismissed the officers, but the independent hearing examiner has reinstated them.\"He added, \"It is important that before any consideration is given to placing these officers back on the street, they be retrained and fully understand the policies of this city. Mr. Chavez's family lost a loved one, and even though the hearing examiner has reinstated these officers, no one should be rejoicing under the circumstances.\"Finner asked for prayers for the Chavez family and asked that everyone respect the process, saying it's a difficult time for the family, the department and the community.

        "content": "(CNN)Five shootings targeting homeless men in New York City and Washington, DC, over the past two weeks were carried out by a single suspect who is now the subject of an \"urgent\" manhunt, officials said Sunday.The shootings took place between March 3 and March 12 and left two men dead, the New York Police Department and Washington's Metropolitan Police Department said in a joint statement. Each shooting happened in the middle of the night and targeted men experiencing homelessness, authorities said.Three of the shootings were last week in Washington, followed by two more in New York this weekend.The NYPD and MPD cited similar circumstances and characteristics in each attack, although they did not release specific details. Speaking to Bloomberg on Monday, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said a ballistics match helped law enforcement connect the shootings.The agencies are working with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives on the investigation and have offered a combined $55,000 for information leading to the arrest of the suspect.Read MoreOfficials released new images of the suspect wanted in connection to the shootings and called on the public to help identify and locate him.\"We know that this is a scary situation,\" Bowser said at a news conference Monday evening. \"We know that our unsheltered residents already face a lot of daily dangers and it is unconscionable that anybody would target this vulnerable population.\"MORE PHOTOS of the wanted suspect.

Police were instructed to show individuals a flyer with the photo of a man police want to talk to in connection with the shootings.The NYPD released photos of the person they believed targeted homeless men in two shootings Saturday.The attacks in New York come about a month after Adams unveiled a plan to increase safety and address homelessness on the subway system. The suspects in several recent high-profile subway attacks were described as homeless, including in the death of Michelle Alyssa Go, who was pushed in front of a train in January.Still, homeless people have long been at a higher risk of experiencing violence than the general population. In a 2014 study by the National Health Care for the Homeless Council, researchers interviewed 516 homeless adults and about half reported that they had been the victim of an attack.Such violence against the homeless has continued in recent years. In 2019, four homeless men were killed and a fifth was seriously injured in Manhattan's Chinatown neighborhood when a fellow homeless man struck their heads with a metal object as they slept, police said at the time.In a statement, the group Coalition for the Homeless linked the mayor's move to clear out subways to the violence.\"Despite the headlines, homeless New Yorkers are far more likely to be victims of violent crime than perpetrators,\" the group said in a statement Sunday. \"Saturday's tragedy is an urgent reminder that many unsheltered New Yorkers choose to bed down in the subways because that is where they feel the most safe in the absence of housing and low-barrier shelters.\"A timeline of the shootingsThe first shooting happened around 4 a.m. on March 3 in the 1100 block of New York Avenue Northeast, the MPD said in an earlier statement Sunday. Officers responded to a call of shots fired and found a man suffering from apparent gunshot wounds. He was treated at a hospital for non-life-threatening injuries, the statement said.The second shooting was reported around 1:21 a.m. on March 8 in the 1700 block of H Street Northeast, MPD said. Officers found another man suffering from apparent gunshot wounds and he was taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.Then, around 2:54 a.m. on March 9, an MPD member noticed a fire in the 400 block of New York Avenue Northeast and a man's remains were discovered after the flames were extinguished. The cause of death was determined to be multiple stab and gunshot wounds, police said.Two people shot, one fatally, while sleeping on NYC streetsThe fourth and fifth shootings occurred in New York City early Saturday when the suspect opened fire on two apparently homeless people who were sleeping on the street, killing one and wounding the other, the NYPD said.The shootings happened about 90 minutes apart in Lower Manhattan and were caught on surveillance cameras, the department said. The NYPD described what the videos showed but did not release them to CNN.One video shows a man who appeared to be homeless sleeping near the corner of King Street and Varick when an unknown suspect approached and shot him in his forearm, NYPD Deputy Chief Commanding Officer Henry Sautner said during a news conference Saturday. The man woke up and shouted, \"What are you doing?\" at the shooter, who then ran away, Sautner added. Police were called to the scene around 4:30 a.m. Saturday and the 38-year-old victim was taken to a hospital for treatment.In addition, investigators became aware of a second shooting outside 148 Lafayette Street on Saturday. There, officers found a man in a sleeping bag with gunshot wounds to his head and neck, and he was pronounced dead at the scene, Sautner said. Surveillance video shows a suspect approaching the sleeping victim around 6:00 a.m. and discharging a weapon, Sautner said.Mayor Adams described the surveillance videos of the two New York shootings as \"chilling.\"\"This individual approached the two men, one at a time, you see him looking around, making sure no one was around, kicking the homeless person to make sure they were not asleep and just assassinated him,\" Adams said Sunday. \"It was just something you would not imagine would take place in our city.\"Shootings are 'heinous crimes,' mayors say In their joint statement Sunday, Mayors Adams and Bowser called the shootings \"heinous crimes\" and called on residents to report any information that could help the investigation.\"The work to get this individual off our streets before he hurts or murders another individual is urgent. The rise in gun violence has shaken all of us and it is particularly horrible to know that someone is out there deliberately doing harm to an already vulnerable population,\" they said.The mayors also called on residents who are homeless to seek shelter.\"It is heartbreaking and tragic to know that in addition to all the dangers that unsheltered residents face, we now have a cold-blooded killer on the loose, but we are certain that we will get the suspect off the street and into police custody,\" they said.The shootings come as the NYPD grapples with upticks across every major crime category in the city. Major crimes spiked nearly 60% in February compared to the same month in 2021, police data showed.NYC crime wave continues into 2022 New York City recorded a 41% increase in overall major crime through the first months of 2022 compared to the same period last year, including a nearly 54% increase in robberies, a 56% increase in grand larceny incidents and a 22% increase in rape reports, the data shows.Murders increased by 10%, while citywide shooting incidents decreased by 1.3%, with 77 incidents in February 2021 and 76 incidents last month, NYPD data shows. City officials are working to get homeless individuals into shelters, Adams said Sunday. \"We're also mobilizing on the streets to notify our homeless to try and get them in shelters, those who want to do so,\" Adams said. \"Being homeless should not turn into a homicide and I want to catch this guy bad.\" Adams unveiled his 'Blueprint to End Gun Violence' in January, which includes long-term goals to grow economic opportunities, improve child education and provide more access to mental health resources while addressing the gun crisis.CNN's Greg Clary, Brynn Gingras and Laura Studley contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)A controversial unit within the New York Police Department that was revived to battle rising gun violence in the city is finally hitting the streets on Monday, promising significant training, and even new uniforms, to prevent aggressive and abusive policing tactics that had plagued its predecessor.The so-called Neighborhood Safety Teams, the latest version of plainclothes units designed to go after firearms, will be deployed to roughly 25 neighborhoods officials say represent 80% of the gun violence in the city. When the unit is fully built, the specialized officers will be in 30 neighborhoods and several public housing projects, city officials said. The unit replaces the anti-crime team disbanded in 2020.While the new team steps off on Monday, the latest crime statistics show crime up in every major category, which includes murder, rape, robbery and others. As of the first week of March, major crimes were up 47% since the start of the year, compared to the same time last year.And while the new neighborhood safety teams have been pegged as one of many long term solutions for crime, there continues to be a constant spate of high profile crimes.\"It's important that he bring crime down. He has a very short window in which to do it before New Yorkers start to question whether or not he can do the job and start questioning his leadership,\" said Basil Smikle, a longtime political strategist and lecturer at both Columbia University and Hunter College.Read MoreTraining focused on minimal force, de-escalationThe new teams are designed to pick up where the anti-crime team left off. The issue has been addressing community concerns such as officers in plainclothes jumping out of unmarked cars, leading many in the community to argue they didn't know they were dealing with police. In response, the NYPD has instituted more training, new uniforms and included community members as part of the process.\"These teams are there for gun violence,\" NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell said at a news conference on Friday. \"They are there for criminal activity but they look like police officers. They are not in plain clothes. Their uniforms clearly have the NYPD on the back. They are there for the safety of the community and to get violent offenders off the street.\"Sewell said to make the new teams happen, they had to look at the mistakes of the past.The NYPD has resurrected its controversial anti-crime unit. Success will be determined by avoiding mistakes of the past The new neighborhood safety teams are made up of a sergeant and five officers. All were put through a seven-day training period where they were tactically trained as a team. They also learned minimal force techniques, advanced tactics in car stop de-escalation, communication skills, courtroom testimony training and constitutional policing, said NYPD Chief of Department Kenneth Corey, who has overseen the new unit's training.\"The training surrounding investigative encounters is the same material that has been reviewed and approved by the court appointed federal monitor, so we know we are fully compliant,\" Corey said.The teams were created after NYPD officials got recommendations from precinct commanders as to who should make up the new group. Once selected, each member went through the training period, with half their instruction happening at the police academy and the other half from the NYPD gun range, according to a law enforcement official. Part of their new training was how to gather intelligence and use the information to get guns off the street.New neighborhood safety team members went over specialized training such as the critical decision-making model and even in-depth foot pursuit concepts, the official said.JUST WATCHEDHear first female NYPD commissioner react to historic appointmentReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHear first female NYPD commissioner react to historic appointment 01:03A key component to the success of the group is oversight, with team members going over stops and arrests by reviewing body camera footage with their supervisors, the official said.And while officers will be wearing their new gear such as half-sleeve shirts and vests with \"NYPD\" on either the chest or on logos, along with the department issued cargo pants and their full gun belt, they'll still be in unmarked cars. Those vehicles, however, are expected to have dashboard cameras, the official said.As part of the initial rollout, these teams will be meeting with community members and will be setting up a time to introduce themselves at community board meetings in the neighborhoods they are sent to, the official said.Teams replace controversial unit disbanded in 2020Previous versions of this type of team were met with allegations of police brutality and aggressive policing tactics. But Mayor Eric Adams, who has now made good on a campaign promise to bring back a revamped version of the beleaguered unit, said the group needed to meet the new standard he set for them. Adams initially promised the units would be on the streets in three weeks since he first made the announcement in January. And while there was a delay in the timeline Mayor Adams gave, his reasoning was they were trying to get it right.\"I was not going to put out a unit that was going to go after those who are carrying illegal guns unless I felt comfortable and we were not going back to the days of being abusive,\" Mayor Adams said at a news conference on Saturday, adding the units would follow a precision policing model and not criminalizing an entire neighborhood, a complaint he heard from residents.City Councilman Justin Brannan, a member of the city council's committee on public safety, said Adams and his team presented his plan for the re-imagined anti-crime unit to lawmakers over a Zoom call last month. And while some had issues with bringing back a team with a checkered past, Brannan said he was in support of the new unit.\"Public safety and police accountability do not need to live in constant tension,\" Brannan said. \"The average New Yorker wants to feel safe, wants to know that when they call 911, there'll be a quick response. They want the police to be accountable and to act professionally. That's a very basic sentiment that just about everybody can agree with. So with the rise in gun violence and the rising crime, this is a step in the right direction toward making people feel safe again.\"New York City crime wave continues into 2022 as city rolls out safety plan City Councilwoman Tiffany Caban challenged the rollout of the teams, saying the new uniforms aren't enough and pointed to other parts of the mayor's safety plan aimed at addressing social issues as a way to curtail the violence.\"We talk about how it's going to be different. It's not so much about clothes, it's about culture,\" Caban said, adding she wanted to see more investment in violence interrupters, the city's crisis management systems, mental health care and even summer youth programs.\"We know that those things work, and we need to deeply invest in them rather than continuing to invest in these failed policing policies that decade over decade, have shown themselves not only to be ineffective but to have driven a lot of harm in our communities,\" Caban said.New units face challenge of rising crimeOn Saturday, two workers at the famed Metropolitan Museum of Art were stabbed by an assailant. In February, a man on the subway in the Bronx rubbed feces in a woman's face who rejected his unwanted advances. Also in February, an Asian woman was pushed into her Lower East Side home and killed while her neighbors heard her helpless screams.And on Monday morning, authorities were searching for an unidentified assailant who shot homeless victims while they were sleeping in Washington DC and New York, killing one in each region. \"(Adams) election was largely due to his insistence that being the former police officer, he knew how to be able to tackle crime but also do it in a way that responded to community concerns about police brutality and the accountability,\" Smikle said.\"The challenge for him is to bring back this very controversial unit and bring crime down in a way that also supports a good percentage of the electorate's desire for rethinking and reframing what police officers actually do. And that's going to be a very difficult challenge for him going forward. And as I said, he's got a very short window.\"",

If no one addresses this issue, they'll keep kicking in our doors and murdering us.\"Sunday marked the two-year anniversary of Taylor's death. The 26-year-old was shot and killed during the police raid at her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky, in March 2020. Her death sparked protests across the country. \"For the nation, it's been two years and one day,\" Palmer said. \"For me, I'm trapped in March 13, 2020. I don't know how people think I should just move on.\"One officer, Brett Hankison, was charged with wanton endangerment for firing 10 bullets into Taylor's apartment, but he was acquitted by a jury earlier this month. Hankison was fired from the Louisville Police Department in 2020. Read MoreThe two other officers involved in the raid have not been charged. One, Myles Cosgrove, was terminated in January 2021 for firing rounds into Taylor's home and for failing to activate his body camera. Another officer, Jonathan Mattingly, retired in April 2021.Benjamin Crump, the attorney for Taylor's family, said he and Palmer met with Kristen Clarke, the top official of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, for about 45 minutes Monday morning, to demand an investigation into all three officers.\"They said, 'Be not dismayed,'\" Crump said, recounting the meeting. \"They're turning over every stone, looking at any civil rights charges on behalf of Breonna Taylor, because they would do the same for any citizen. Because Breonna Taylor deserves it.\"A spokesperson for the Justice Department said, \"Today, Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke and attorneys in the Civil Rights Division met with the mother of Breonna Taylor, members of her family and her attorneys. As has been previously stated, this matter is currently under investigation, and we have no further comment.\"Attorney General Merrick Garland announced a pattern or practice investigation into the Louisville, Kentucky, police department last April, but no federal charges have been brought in connection to the police raid at Taylor's apartment.\"I watched Attorney General Merrick Garland swell up with tears when he talked about Ahmaud Arbery,\" activist Tamika Mallory said at the news conference. \"Well, we are crying. We are crying Attorney General. We are crying for Breonna Taylor, and we demand you take those tears and turn them into action. And make sure that the ink of your pen strokes for justice for Breonna Taylor. Charge the cops.\"The Justice Department charged three men, who were ultimately found guilty last month, with federal hate crimes following the death of Ahmaud Arbery. Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, was shot and killed while jogging on the public streets of a Georgia neighborhood in February 2020.Kentucky's attorney general, Daniel Cameron, has come under intense criticism for his role in the Taylor shooting investigation. Last January, three former grand jurors petitioned the Kentucky legislature to impeach Cameron after some said they were never given the opportunity to consider homicide charges in the Taylor case. At least one of the grand jurors said that Cameron's public statements about the grand jury were misleading.\"Half of my life has been spent being Breonna's mother -- it's the only thing I've learned to do well in my life,\" Palmer said. \"It's the thing I will die fighting for. Fighting to make sure she gets justice. Fighting to make sure people remember she deserves justice. Fighting to remember that Kentucky failed her. Daniel Cameron failed her. Daniel Cameron has failed the world.\"Cameron has previously said that officers Cosgrove and Mattingly were justified shooting in self-defense because Taylor's boyfriend fired first. In an interview with the Associated Press in August, Cameron also said the decision not to charge any of the officers directly with Taylor's death was ultimately in the grand jury's hands.This story has been updated with additional details.",

        "content": "(CNN)Here's a look at the opioid crisis. Experts say the United States is in the throes of an opioid epidemic. An estimated 9.5 million Americans aged 12 and older misused opioids in 2020, including 9.3 million prescription pain reliever abusers and 902,000 heroin users.Opioids are drugs formulated to replicate the pain-reducing properties of opium. Prescription painkillers like morphine, oxycodone and hydrocodone are opioids. Illegal drugs like heroin and illicitly made fentanyl are also opioids. The word \"opioid\" is derived from the word \"opium.\" Synthetic opioids, primarily fentanyl, caused nearly two-thirds (64%) of the more than 100,000 drug overdose deaths in the US in the 12-month period ending April 2021, up 49% from the year before, the CDC's 's National Center for Health Statistics found.Prescription opioid volumes peaked in 2011, with the equivalent of 240 billion milligrams of morphine prescribed, according to the market research firm, IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science. In 2018, prescription opioid volume fell by 29.2 billion morphine milligram equivalents, a dramatic decline.Read MoreAlabama, Arkansas, Louisiana and Tennessee had the highest opioid dispensing rates in 2020.Common OpioidsOpioids such as morphine and codeine are naturally derived from opium poppy plants more commonly grown in Asia, Central America and South America. Heroin is an illegal drug synthesized from morphine. Hydrocodone and oxycodone are semi-synthetic opioids, manufactured in labs with natural and synthetic ingredients. Fentanyl is a fully synthetic opioid, originally developed as a powerful anesthetic for surgery.  It is also administered to alleviate severe pain associated with terminal illnesses like cancer. The drug is up to 100 times more powerful than morphine. Just a small dose can be deadly. Illicitly produced fentanyl has been a driving factor in the number of overdose deaths in recent years. Methadone is another fully synthetic opioid. It is commonly dispensed to recovering heroin addicts to relieve the symptoms of withdrawal.    Opioids bind to receptors in the brain and spinal cord, disrupting pain signals. They also activate the reward areas of the brain by releasing the hormone dopamine, creating a feeling of euphoria or a \"high.\"AddictionOpioid use disorder is the clinical term for opioid addiction or abuse.People who become dependent on opioids may experience withdrawal symptoms when they stop using the medication. Dependence is often coupled with tolerance, meaning that users need to take increasingly larger doses for the same effect. People who become dependent on pain pills may switch to heroin because it is less expensive than prescription drugs. Individuals who are addicted to prescription opioids are 40 times more likely to become addicted to heroin.A drug called naloxone, available as an injection or a nasal spray, is used as a treatment for overdoses. It blocks or reverses the effects of opioids and is often carried by first responders. More data on overdose deaths  Regulation and FundingThe 21st Century Cures Act, passed in 2016, allocated $1 billion over two years in opioid crisis grants to states, providing funding for expanded treatment and prevention programs. In April 2017, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price announced the distribution of the first round of $485 million in grants to all 50 states and US territories.In August 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the launch of an Opioid Fraud and Abuse Detection Unit within the Department of Justice. The unit's mission is to prosecute individuals who commit opioid-related health care fraud. The DOJ is also appointing US attorneys who will specialize in opioid health care fraud cases as part of a three-year pilot program in 12 jurisdictions nationwide. On October 24, 2018, President Donald Trump signed opioid legislation into law. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act includes provisions aimed at promoting research to find new drugs for pain management that will not be addictive. It also expands access to treatment for substance use disorders for Medicaid patients.State legislatures are also introducing measures to regulate pain clinics and limit the quantity of opioids that doctors can dispense. Timeline1861-1865 - During the Civil War, medics use morphine as a battlefield anesthetic. Many soldiers become dependent on the drug. 1898 - Heroin is first produced commercially by the Bayer Company. At the time, heroin is believed to be less habit-forming than morphine, so it is dispensed to individuals who are addicted to morphine.1914 - Congress passes the Harrison Narcotics Act, which requires that doctors write prescriptions for narcotic drugs like opioids and cocaine. Importers, manufacturers and distributors of narcotics must register with the Treasury Department and pay taxes on products  1924 - The Anti-Heroin Act bans the production and sale of heroin in the United States. 1970 - The Controlled Substances Act becomes law. It creates groupings (or schedules) of drugs based on the potential for abuse. Heroin is a Schedule I drug while morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone (Percocet) and methadone are Schedule II. Hydrocodone (Vicodin) is originally a Schedule III medication. It is later recategorized as a Schedule II drug. January 10, 1980 - A letter titled \"Addiction Rare in Patients Treated with Narcotics\" is published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It looks at incidences of painkiller addiction in a very specific population of hospitalized patients who were closely monitored. It becomes widely cited as proof that narcotics are a safe treatment for chronic pain. 1995 - OxyContin, a long-acting version of oxycodone that slowly releases the drug over 12 hours, is introduced and aggressively marketed as a safer pain pill by manufacturer, Purdue Pharma. May 10, 2007 - Purdue Pharma pleads guilty for misleadingly advertising OxyContin as safer and less addictive than other opioids. The company and three executives are charged with \"misleading and defrauding physicians and consumers.\" Purdue and the executives agree to pay $634.5 million in criminal and civil fines. 2010 - FDA approves an \"abuse-deterrent\" formulation of OxyContin, to help curb abuse. However, people still find ways to abuse it. May 20, 2015 - The DEA announces that it has arrested 280 people, including 22 doctors and pharmacists, after a 15-month sting operation centered on health care providers who dispense large amounts of opioids. The sting, dubbed Operation Pilluted, is the largest prescription drug bust in the history of the DEA.   March 18, 2016 - The CDC publishes guidelines for prescribing opioids for patients with chronic pain. Recommendations include prescribing over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen and ibuprofen in lieu of opioids. Doctors are encouraged to promote exercise and behavioral treatments to help patients cope with pain.   March 29, 2017 - Trump signs an executive order calling for the establishment of the President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is selected as the chairman of the group, with Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as an adviser.July 31, 2017 - After a delay, the White House panel examining the nation's opioid epidemic releases its interim report, asking Trump to declare a national public health emergency to combat the ongoing crisis September 22, 2017 - The pharmacy chain CVS announces that it will implement new restrictions on filling prescriptions for opioids, dispensing a limited seven-day supply to patients who are new to pain therapy. November 1, 2017 - The opioid commission releases its final report. Its 56 recommendations include a proposal to establish nationwide drug courts that would place opioid addicts in treatment facilities rather than prison. February 9, 2018 - A budget agreement signed by Trump authorizes $6 billion for opioid programs, with $3 billion allocated for 2018 and $3 billion allocated for 2019. February 27, 2018 - Sessions announces a new opioid initiative: The Prescription Interdiction & Litigation (PIL) Task Force. The mission of the task force is to support local jurisdictions that have filed lawsuits against prescription drugmakers and distributors.March 19, 2018 - The Trump administration outlines an initiative to stop opioid abuse. The three areas of concentration are law enforcement and interdiction; prevention and education via an ad campaign; and job-seeking assistance for individuals fighting addiction.April 9, 2018 - The US surgeon general issues an advisory recommending that Americans carry the opioid overdose-reversing drug, naloxone. A surgeon general advisory is a rarely used tool to convey an urgent message. The last advisory issued by the surgeon general, more than a decade ago, focused on drinking during pregnancy.May 1, 2018 - The Journal of the American Medical Association publishes a study that finds synthetic opioids like fentanyl caused about 46% of opioid deaths in 2016. That's a three-fold increase compared with 2010, when synthetic opioids were involved in about 14% of opioid overdose deaths. It's the first time that synthetic opioids surpassed prescription opioids and heroin as the primary cause of overdose fatalities.  May 30, 2018 - The journal Medical Care publishes a study that estimates the cost of medical care and substance abuse treatment for opioid addiction was $78.5 billion in 2013.  June 7, 2018 - The White House announces a new multimillion dollar public awareness advertising campaign to combat opioid addiction. The first four ads of the campaign are all based on true stories illustrating the extreme lengths young adults have gone to obtain the powerful drugs.December 12, 2018 - According to the National Center for Health Statistics, fentanyl is now the most commonly used drug involved in drug overdoses. The rate of drug overdoses involving the synthetic opioid skyrocketed by about 113% each year from 2013 through 2016.January 14, 2019 - The National Safety Council finds that, for the first time on record, the odds of dying from an opioid overdose in the United States are now greater than those of dying in a vehicle crash.July 17, 2019 - The CDC releases preliminary data showing a 5.1% decline in drug overdoses during 2018. If the preliminary number is accurate, it would mark the first annual drop in overdose deaths in more than two decades.September 30, 2019 - The FDA and DEA announce that they sent warnings to four online networks, operating a total of 10 websites, which the agencies said are illegally marketing unapproved and misbranded versions of opioid medicines, including tramadol.",

            "Prescription and illegal opioids are commonly abused because they are so addictive. Opioid medications bind to the areas of the brain that control pain and emotions, driving up levels of the feel-good hormone dopamine in the brain's reward areas and producing an intense feeling of euphoria. As the brain becomes used to the feelings, it often takes more and more of the drug to produce the same levels of pain relief and well-being, leading to dependence and, later, addiction.",
            "Oxymorphone hydrochloride \u2014 Oxymorphone hydrochloride, under the name Opana ER, was at the center of an HIV outbreak in Indiana in 2015. Some addicts began injecting and shared needles increased the spread of HIV. In June, the Food and Drug Administration requested that Opana ER manufacturer Endo Pharmaceuticals pull the drug from the market. It was the first time the agency has asked that a opioid pain medication be pulled \"due to the public health consequences of abuse.\" Endo announced in July that it would pull the drug.",
            "Codeine \u2014 Codeine is one of the weakest opioids, often given when painkillers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen fail to work. Because it decreases activity in the part of the brain that controls coughing, it's frequently mixed with other liquids to develop cough syrups for colds and flu. It has frequently been used for pain relief after removal of tonsils and adenoids in children. After an investigation, the FDA restricted the use of codeine and tramadol in children under 12 and recommend against their use in children between 12 and 18 years of age. Additionally, the FDA has warned breastfeeding mothers not to take these medications due to the risk of serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants.",
            "Heroin \u2014 You can't get heroin by prescription, but many heroin users start off abusing prescription opioids, then turn to this illegal opioid. CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta has reported on recent research that shows today's typical heroin addict starts using at 23, is more likely to live in affluent suburbs and was likely unwittingly led to heroin through painkillers prescribed by his or her doctor. According to the CDC , deaths from overdoses of prescription drugs and heroin continue to be the leading cause of unintentional death for Americans, rising 14% from 2013 to 2014.",
            "Fentanyl \u2014 Fentanyl citrate, pictured here, is a Class II controlled substance and one of the most powerful opioids on the market. It's often administered via injection or transdermal patch, or in lozenge form for pain after surgery, for difficult-to-manage chronic pain and for people who have developed a tolerance to other opioids. The type of fentanyl usually associated with  overdoses is bought on the street in powder or pill form and is often mixed with heroin in a clandestine lab to increase the high it produces. Street names include Apache, China girl, goodfella, jackpot, murder 8, TNT and Tango and Cash.",
            "Hydrocodone \u2014 These pills are a more powerful form of codeine, called hydrocodone, and are often mixed with acetaminophen. Hydrocodone is the most frequently prescribed opioid painkiller, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , and the most abused. An overdose of hydrocodone can cause \"cold and clammy skin, severely constricted pupils, and slow breathing that can lead to a loss of consciousness and death.\"",
            "Oxycodone \u2014 Oxycodone is a powerful narcotic pain reliever prescribed for moderate to high pain relief. It's often given in an extended-release formula for patients who will need to be on pain medications for long periods of time. Patients are warned not to break, chew, crush or dissolve extended-release tablets because the rush of oxycodone into the system could cause serious health problems, including overdose and death. Though highly addictive, oxycodone is not thought to be as frequently abused as hydrocodone. OxyContin, Percocet, Percodan and Tylox are some trade-name oxycodone products.",
            "Morphine \u2014 Morphine is another powerful opioid often administered via syringe for severe pain. It can come in pill form, usually as extended-release tablets and capsules, and is prescribed only to relieve difficult, chronic pain that cannot be controlled by the use of other pain medications. As with most opioids, mixing medications, drinking alcohol or taking other meds that contain alcohol, or using street drugs while taking morphine, increases the risk of breathing problems or other serious, life-threatening side effects.",
            "Meperidine \u2014 Meperidine is another narcotic analgesic, similar to morphine. It's often used to help put people to sleep before an operation and to provide pain relief after childbirth. The most common brand name is Demerol, which comes in both tablet and liquid forms. It is usually taken with or without food every three or four hours as needed for pain.

            "Buprenorphine \u2014 Buprenorphine is a opioid used as an alternative to methadone to help addicts recovering from heroin use. Buprenorphine is different from other opioids because it's a \"partial opioid agonist,\" which means that when taken in proper prescribed doses, it should produce less euphoria and physical dependence, and therefore a lower potential for misuse.  It's also supposed to have a relatively mild withdrawal profile. However, if abused by crushing and snorting or injecting, it can suppress breathing and cause dizziness, confusion, unconsciousness and death. Subutex, the brand name for buprenorphine, is taken as a tablet placed under the tongue and allowed to dissolve. The brand Suboxone is a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone, an opioid antagonist. Antagonists block the opiate receptors in the brain, keeping the narcotic from creating the high abusers crave."

        "content": "(CNN)An outside review of Minneapolis' response to protests in the spring of 2020, following the murder of George Floyd by a city police officer, found widespread chaos and poor communication among city leaders that contributed to an unorganized police response to violent unrest that later spread across the country. The mayor's office failed to follow its own \"well written, comprehensive\" emergency operations plan, the city's Office of Emergency Management \"minimally engaged in its coordination role,\" and the city's police and fire departments didn't use the plan to guide their response, according to the report, produced by Hillard Heintze, a security risk management firm. Distrust that existed before the murder of George Floyd, the report added, exacerbated already fractured relationships between police and the community. Voters will decide on the future of policing in Minneapolis. The question goes beyond 'defunding the police'Cities across the country saw protests after Floyd's death, ranging from peaceful marches to rampant property destruction and violent street fights between officers and rioters. Several cities launched after-action reviews of some sort, through inspectors general or other government review systems, or by outside law or security firms. \"I had never seen that kind of raw emotion as we saw in the streets, in Minneapolis, Chicago, Detroit, Ferguson, St. Louis, all over the place, all over the world,\" Andrea Jenkins, Minneapolis city council president, told CNN. \"So, had we followed plans to the letter, I don't think we would have necessarily had a better outcome. We would've definitely been able to feel confident we did all we can do. Right now, clearly, the report shows we weren't able to do everything we should have done.\"Read MoreThe Minneapolis report mirrors others in noting that cities were surprised by the tenor of unrest, and that senior law enforcement and elected officials were wholly unprepared for protests, property damage and violence. In Philadelphia, a review found that the city was \"simply not prepared to address unanticipated mass protests coupled with civil unrest occurring in multiple locations throughout the city.\" Police in Chicago resorted to forming ad hoc groups to get downtown using public transit buses, and senior leadership said they didn't have any reason to suspect protests because the Chicago Police Department \"had not received any intelligence in advance which might have predicted them.\"People sit on the street in front of a row of police officers during a rally in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on May 29, 2020 after the death of George Floyd.In Los Angeles, a review found the city unprepared for \"small groups\" responsible for violence among larger groups of protesters, and the police department's \"lack of adequate planning and preparation\" left police in a reactive position. But the Minneapolis review went further. It faulted government officials at all levels -- and the structure of the Minneapolis government itself -- for the disjointed and chaotic response to protests that overtook the city after Floyd's death, including a police precinct that was overrun by rioters and torched. The review found a \"concerning\" lack of documentation for patrol ranks who were using less lethal rounds on protesters. Poor management of the protests, the review added, contributed to the traumatization of residents, business owners, city workers and elected officials. Meanwhile, the report said residents felt abandoned by the city and had to resort to forming their own patrols to protect property. \"After more than 18 months, community members are still deeply shaken, and emotions are still high about Floyd's death and the events that followed,\" the report stated. \"Many community members and government officials, including members of the MPD, are awaiting answers to understand what went wrong with aspects of the City's response to the protests and unrest and how to prevent violent unrest from occurring again.\" 'Inconsistent' messagingThe report highlighted public disagreements between Minneapolis' mayor and Minnesota's governor. Some interviewed by investigators thought city council members created \"more issues than necessary\" by counteracting police actions and talking about abolishing the police. And some said city council members fed into rumors that created stress and fear among residents. The mayor has \"already directed staff to implement a plan for improving our emergency response process,\" a spokesperson for Mayor Jacob Frey told CNN. \"Trainings are underway, new structures are being put in place, and we are in routine contact with multi-jurisdictional partners to enhance communications and operational preparedness.\"Lisa Bender, city council president at the time of the unrest, and Medaria Arradondo, chief of police during the unrest, weren't immediately available to comment. Nine city councilors gathered in Powderhorn Park after the unrest and stood near an \"Abolish the Police\" sign. Then Bender said the group was committed to \"dismantling policing as we know it in Minneapolis.\" With nine votes the city council would have a veto-proof supermajority of the council's 13 members, Bender said.Why Minneapolis voters rejected policing overhaul ballot measure prompted by George Floyd's murderSome of those interviewed said city council members \"were feeding into rumors and creating stress and fear in people,\" and that \"political differences played a part in slowing down the crisis management responses.\" The report also faulted Minneapolis' style of government as contributing to \"inconsistent\" messaging and \"a lack of information that the publicly desperately sought.\" The city had a unique structure that gave the city council and mayor shared oversight of most departments and the mayor command of the police department.\"We had mutual aid groups come up, neighborhood watch groups, we had neighbors and small business owners sitting in front of businesses with rifles and guns,\" said Jenkins, the city council president. \"It was a mess. Do I think that the report accurately depicts the challenges with our gov't structure? I think it does.\" That structure became the subject of 18 months of political debate that resulted in voters having a chance to restructure government. In the days after the unrest, some elected officials began a campaign to split the police department from the mayor's control, do away with a requirement to employ a minimum number of officers, and put control of any remaining police officers under a broader public safety department. Protesters hold up their fists as flames rise behind them in front of the Third Police Precinct on May 28, 2020 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.Opponents waged a counter campaign, asking voters to give the mayor control of all city departments that were overseen by the city council and to reject the plan to reorganize the police department. Voters sided with the mayor, in what was locally seen as a referendum on the \"defund the police\" movement that came into national prominence because of the image of city councilors in Powderhorn Park. \"It is all the mayor's problem now. But how do I tell that to my constituents? 'Call the mayor?' I can't say that,\" Jenkins said. \"They're not trying to hear that. They want to know what I'm going to do. But in reality it's all the mayor, all on his plate now.\" 'No direction, objectives or rules of engagement'The report describes the Minneapolis Police Department as lacking consistent leadership, with morale affected by uneven rules enforcement and leadership capability among supervisors. It also depicts the department as lacking consistent standards, and hampered by Covid-19 in its ability to continue training for large-scale events. This contributed to \"angst among personnel in the field\" who \"desperately sought information, guidance and approvals ... and found those calls went unanswered or delayed.\" The report noted that some officers \"operated effectively in the chaos, despite -- and seemingly because of -- the lack of guidance they received.\" A meeting of police leaders occurred the day after the first violence, according to the report, but it didn't result in a command structure or plan for future protests. Some interviewed for the report thought the 2015 occupation of a police station by protesters, following a different fatal shooting by police officers, should have given police commanders reason to anticipate some civil unrest. But \"many supervisors and command-level MPD officers stated that generally, the (police department) does not plan and rather just hopes for the best outcome.)\"\"We should know who all had chemical weapons, who had less-than-lethal munitions, and even who used them,\" Jenkins said. \"There was no real command centers, even on incidents, that first day of not having a plan snowballed.\" The fire department's attempt to bring in extra staffing was initially slowed by a \"password issue\" that didn't allow them access to an internal mass communication tool to reach fire department members, according to the report. Beyond that, the system wasn't kept up to date. This prevented leaders from bringing extra firefighters to work. They tried a phone tree, according to the report, but it took so long that it was abandoned as shift-change time approached. At times, different city departments were monitoring city cameras, and in some cases a person would move one camera only to have it moved by someone else across the city. Additionally, some officers were outfitted with protective gear police found leftover from the 2008 Republican National Convention, and officers often were working without.Exclusive: Derek Chauvin jurors speak out for the first time, recalling 'traumatic experience' and that light-bulb momentThe lack of coordination and supervision contributed to confusion among lower-ranking officers and a breakdown in accountability, particularly pertaining to so-called 40-millimeter less-lethal rounds fired by police during the unrest, according to the review. It found that the less-lethal rounds were widely used, but there wasn't good documentation for their use, which sometimes wasn't compliant with policy. The degree to which officers complied with policy seemed to differ depending on whether they were with the SWAT team or patrol, though the review found violations with both. The report found that some field-level supervisors \"received no direction, objectives or rules of engagement\" and absent some commander, \"chain of command is lost. This \"exponentially increase(d) the level of stress of officers standing on the line as they face angry crowds throwing objects at them and can lead to less desirable outcomes with those protesting ... it creates situations wherein officers act independently. Those independent actions may not align with any department policies or desired command-level objectives communicated to the field.\"When the time came to request the National Guard, investigators found that those making requests were \"unfamiliar with the process,\" and that caused a delay in the eventual approval. Mayor Frey, according to the report, made a \"verbal request to the governor\" followed by a written request, but it lacked specific information germane to deploying guardsmen. Residents were left to news reports, group chats and \"informal ad hoc neighborhood meetings\" to get information about what was happening. Investigators heard from residents who saw rioters setting fires but had no guidance from the city about whether they should flee or stay sheltered in place. And through it all, the police department's ability to respond to normal calls for service was severely hampered. The report describes an instance where a woman was stabbed in a Target parking lot. When officers arrived, they had to form a perimeter around the victim, use gas and non-lethal rounds to keep a crowd back, and carried her to a police van on a flatbed cart. Officers took her to the hospital in the back of the van.",

        "content": "(CNN)When Jonathan Franks first heard that the American basketball star Brittney Griner had been detained in Russia, his initial sense was one of disbelief.But it wasn't any kind of incredulity that she'd been arrested accused of possession of some cannabis oil at an airport near Moscow, more that any western media would relay the details of her alleged crime as if it was fact.\"This is being reported as if people are taking these allegations seriously,\" he told CNN.  \"I think that it's a huge mistake to report these allegations as if they're true or even are likely to be true.\"Brittney Griner: Why so many WNBA stars play basketball overseasFranks was immediately suspicious, because he has worked on behalf of numerous American citizens who have unexpectedly found themselves in similar situations with hostile governments. He's currently the campaign spokesman for Trevor Reed, who has been detained in Russia since August 2019.Based on the limited information that has been provided by the Russian Federal Customs Service and state media, Franks is very concerned about the predicament that Griner now finds herself to be in.Read More\"This has a lot of hallmarks of a very wrongful and arbitrary detention,\" he explained. \"I found the video from the Russian customs service odd. They're parading her before cameras. The mugshot was completely unnecessary and asinine.\"Brittney Griner #42 of the Phoenix Mercury during the first half of the WNBA game at the Footprint Center on August 31, 2021 in Phoenix, Arizona. The Russian Customs Service claims that Griner was 'smuggling significant amounts of narcotic substances' and says that a criminal case is underway. A potential jail sentence of 10 years has been mentioned.\"They're making her out to sound like a drug kingpin. I think that it is unlikely that Ms. Griner will get a fair trial,\" concludes Franks, \"because nobody gets a fair trial in Russia. It's a rigged game.\"  In 2014, the American Iranian journalist Jason Rezaian was detained in Tehran. He couldn't have known it at the time, but he was in for a long stay at Iran's notorious Evin Prison: 544 days.The Washington Post reporter was eventually released in January 2016, and in Griner's case he sees many parallels to his own. \"It's the most audacious hostage taking by a state imaginable,\" Rezaian told CNN.\"I know from my own case that the supposed charges against me were not based in anything like reality, and they were used to perpetuate a narrative about why I was being held.\"Like Franks, Rezaian cautions against repeating the allegations against Griner verbatim.\"I think that every time reporters repeat that narrative, we're doing some of the dirty work of the hostage takers for them. My attitude is Brittney Griner is innocent of any crimes until the world sees otherwise,\" adds Rezaian.Brittney Griner #42 of the Phoenix Mercury celebrates with fans following Game Two of the 2021 WNBA Finals at Footprint Center on October 13, 2021 in Phoenix, Arizona. The Mercury defeated the Sky 91-86 in overtime.It's still not exactly clear when Griner was apprehended in Russia, but it was some time in February, as she was returning from the States to compete for UMMC Ekaterinburg in the Russian basketball league.It's Griner's seventh season in Russia, where she plays during the off-season in North America. News of her predicament didn't arrive in the US until March 5, when Russia revealed that they were holding her.Only then did Griner's wife, Cherelle, begin writing about it on Instagram. \"There are no words to express this pain,\" she said. \"I'm hurting, we're hurting.\"If she can indeed be classified as a 'hostage,' Griner will join an unenviable club of around more than 50 American citizens who are currently held hostage or wrongfully detained overseas.Campaigners have been working to free Americans Reed and Paul Whelan, who are both in Russia.Whilst acknowledging that Griner's family have been placed under an enormous amount of emotional stress, Rezaian believes they should have spoken up sooner. \"They made the same mistake that I see others making time and again, allowing the possible hostage taker to take control of the narrative,\" says Rezaian.\"Unfortunately, we see people telling themselves: 'This is all just a big mistake that's going to blow over in a few days.' Suppressing her detention isn't doing her any favors, these things don't magically resolve themselves.\"Brittney Griner #15 of Team United States drives to the basket against Team Japan during the first half of the Women's Basketball final game on day sixteen of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic games at Saitama Super Arena on August 08, 2021 in Saitama, Japan. The timing of Griner's detention could hardly be worse, she was arrested in the lead-up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and it was publicized only after the US had begun sanctioning the Russian government.\"You can't extricate these things from each other,\" Rezaian explained. \"To try and maintain diplomatic niceties around these situations may be in the interest of US national security, but it's certainly not in the interest of Brittney Griner.\"Rezaian urges Griner's family to speak up and encourages her American employers to make some noise.Griner is a two-time Olympic champion, a seven-time all-star with the Phoenix Mercury and a legend of the women's professional league, the WNBA. Whilst her team and the league have issued brief statements, Rezaian says they could and should be doing so much more.\"The WNBA, a part of the NBA, one of the biggest and most powerful sports leagues in the whole world, has a real responsibility to this individual,\" he says. \"There should be a robust response.\"Brittney Griner #15 of Team United States takes a selfie with her teammates and their gold medals during the Women's Basketball medal ceremony on day sixteen of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic games at Saitama Super Arena on August 08, 2021 in Saitama, Japan. In the vacuum of information about Griner's situation, some have sought to fill the airwaves with commentary about her involvement with Russian basketball and the wisdom of her decision to travel there at a time when geo-political tensions in the region resembled a powder keg.It's a sentiment that smacks of victim-blaming. \"It's irrelevant,\" says Rezaian. \"It's not a credible argument.\"Franks is equally dismissive. \"Would have, could have, should have. It's Monday morning quarterbacking, and it's not helpful,\" he says. \"They have welcomed her to that country to work. To me, that's pretty brazen.\"Both men say that Griner had every right to continue working as a professional athlete in Russia, and the fact that a country in which she was well known and celebrated has now locked her up only makes the allegations against her more suspicious.Rezaian recalls the countless trips he made in and out of Iran over a period of five years. \"I never had any problems until I did,| he says. \"Is that my fault? No, absolutely not.\"Colin Allred: US Representative says Brittney Griner case is 'extremely concerning' \u200band that her consular access \u200bhas been blocked It's hard for anybody to predict what the coming weeks and months will bring in Griner's case, but Rezaian draws on his own experience to suggest that Griner might have to prepare for a long stay in Russia. \"It may turn out to be a marathon, not a sprint. You hope that it's a sprint but conserve your energy in a way that that will benefit you throughout this ordeal,\" he says.In a podcast called '544 Days,' that he released in October 2021, Rezaian details the anxiety, uncertainty, and monotony of his detention in Iran. He says he made the audio series partly to lay out a roadmap to the families of other citizens that may one day find themselves in a similar situation.\"I tried to find things to laugh at every day because there's certainly a lot of absurdity in these situations,\" he adds.\"That doesn't take away from the horror and the terror of it, but the absurdity that a great American athlete is being held on unsubstantiated charges at the dawn of a cataclysmic war on the other side of the world? It is horrifying, but it's also farcical in its own way.\"Brittney Griner #15 of Team United States poses for photographs with her gold medal during the Women's Basketball medal ceremony on day sixteen of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic games at Saitama Super Arena on August 08, 2021 in Saitama, Japan. Franks knows from his time of advocating for Reed that Griner could be detained for a while. He urges everybody that cares about her to keep her case in the public arena.\"Sports fans can play a huge role because they're not a constituency that I think the [American] government is hearing from,\" says Franks.\"You want to see Brittney Griner come home? Or Trevor Reed or Paul Whelan or any of the other 50 hostages? I would suggest calling the White House every day and telling them you want President Biden to prioritize the repatriation of wrongfully detained American citizens.\"Franks reiterates that Griner's family should do the same. \"There's a difficult choice to make about whether to speak or not to but shine a light,\" he says. \"If it were my loved one, my answer would be shine a light. Every time.\"People that do wrongful detention are oddly sensitive to bad headlines.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)A bipartisan group of senators is sharing concern with the Biden administration about the potential of widespread Russian cyberattacks in the United States as retribution for harsh sanctions against Russia in the wake of President Vladimir Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. In a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas Sunday evening obtained by CNN, 22 senators, led by Nevada Democrat Jacky Rosen and South Dakota Republican Mike Rounds, raised questions about America's readiness for Russian cyber and disinformation threats.\"Given Russia's history of disruptive cyber and disinformation activities, we are concerned that the United States may be targeted in retaliation for actions taken to impose costs on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine,\" the senators wrote.DHS did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.The Biden administration has been on alert for potential Russian criminal or state-backed cyberattacks against critical infrastructure targets in the US -- a posture that Washington assumed months ago but that has grown more acute since Russia invaded Ukraine.Read MoreSecretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier this month that the US is \"very much on guard\" for potential Russian cyberattacks in light of the war. While there have been several hacks of Ukrainian organizations, there have been no significant reports of the sort of high-impact cyberattacks on transportation or electric infrastructure that some have feared.Russia's cyber offensive against Ukraine has been limited so far. Experts are divided on whyIn their letter, the group of senators requested a briefing from Mayorkas about what the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) -- which falls under DHS -- is doing to proactively defend against Russian state-sponsored threats and what sectors might be targeted. They also asked whether a strategy is in place if critical infrastructure is breached and how CISA is \"coordinating with international partners\" on the matter.For months, CISA, the White House and agencies including the Treasury Department have held briefings with key sectors like banking and energy on Russian cyber capabilities and the possibility for retaliation in cyberspace. According to CISA's website, there are currently no specific or credible cyber threats to the US.Russian government-linked hackers have a long track record of infiltrating US government agencies and probing US critical infrastructure. Last year, the Biden administration attributed a successful 2020 cyber-espionage campaign that exploited SolarWinds software to breach several government agencies to Russia's foreign intelligence service, SVR. Russian-speaking ransomware groups have also disrupted US critical infrastructure, most notably last year during the days-long shutdown of Colonial Pipeline, a major fuel transporter for the East Coast.In February, President Joe Biden designated DHS as the lead federal agency to coordinate domestic preparedness and response efforts related to the Russia-Ukraine crisis.Last month, CNN reported that a senior FBI cyber official warned American businesses and local governments to be vigilant about potential ransomware attacks.",

Another American journalist, Juan Arredondo, was wounded.In a tweet, Kyiv region police identified the dead man as Renaud, who was 50. Police posted a photo of his body and his American passport as evidence, as well as a photo of an outdated New York Times press badge with Renaud's name. Andriy Nebitov, the head of the Kyiv region police, said in a Facebook post that Russian forces shot Renaud, adding that \"the occupants cynically kill even journalists of international media, who've been trying to tell the truth about atrocities of Russian military in Ukraine.\"\"Of course, journalism carries risks, but the US citizen Brent Renaud paid with his life for an attempt to shed light on how underhand, cruel, and merciless the aggressor is,\" Nebitov added. CNN has not independently verified the account given by police.Read MoreRenaud is the first foreign journalist known to be killed in the war in Ukraine. A Ukrainian camera operator, Yevhenii Sakun, was reportedly killed when Kyiv's TV tower was shelled earlier this month.Press freedom groups denounced Sunday's violence as a violation of international law.\"Russian forces in Ukraine must stop all violence against journalists and other civilians at once, and whoever killed Renaud should be held to account,\" the Committee to Protect Journalists said in a statement.Time magazine told CNN that Renaud, an acclaimed filmmaker, was in Ukraine in recent weeks to work on \"a Time Studios project focused on the global refugee crisis.\"\"Our hearts are with all of Brent's loved ones,\" the publication said. \"It is essential that journalists are able to safely cover this ongoing invasion and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.\"Arredondo, a Colombian-American photographer, appeared in a social media video from Okhmatdyt hospital in Kyiv and recounted the shooting. He said he and Renaud were driving through a checkpoint in Irpin on the way to film refugees leaving the city when Russian forces opened fire.Arredondo said there were \"two of us,\" and Renaud was \"shot and left behind,\" adding that Renaud was shot in the neck. \"We got split and I got pulled into the (stretcher).\" Asked how he got to the hospital, he replied, \"an ambulance, I don't know.\"Arredondo, a filmmaker and visual journalist who is also an adjunct professor at Columbia Journalism School, posted photos from Zhytomyr, Ukraine, on Saturday, noting in an Instagram post that he is \"#onassignment.\" The Dean of Columbia Journalism School, Steve Coll, told CNN: \"We don't have any independent information about his injuries at this time but are working now to learn more and to see if we can help.\"Arredondo is a prominent photographer, with work featured in The New York Times, National Geographic, The Wall Street Journal, Newsweek, ESPN, Vanity Fair and other media outlets, according to his personal website bio. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister, said in a statement on Telegram that Renaud \"paid with his life for attempting to expose the insidiousness, cruelty and ruthlessness of the aggressor.\"Irpin, in northern Ukraine just outside Kyiv, has been the site of substantial Russian shelling in recent days and has seen extensive destruction, according to the Kyiv regional government on Friday.Tributes to RenaudRenaud was a Peabody Award-winning documentary filmmaker, producer and journalist who lived and worked in New York and Little Rock, Arkansas, according to his biography on the Renaud Brothers website. With his brother Craig, Renaud spent years \"telling humanistic verite stories from the World's hot spots,\" including projects in Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti, Egypt and Libya, according to his website bio.

Ann Marie Lipinski, the director of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard, said the foundation was \"heartsick\" over the death of the journalist, who was a 2019 Harvard Nieman Fellow.\"Our Nieman Fellow Brent Renaud was gifted and kind, and his work was infused with humanity. He was killed today outside Kiev, and the world and journalism are lesser for it. We are heartsick,\" she said in a tweet. A post on the Renaud Brothers Facebook page, dated March 8, urged readers to follow their coverage of the war Ukraine.Christof Putzel, a friend and colleague of Renaud, told CNN his death was a \"devastating\" loss.\"I woke up this morning to the news that Brent, long-time best friend, incredible colleague, the best war journalist I think ever existed, finding out about his passing,\" Putzel said on CNN's \"Reliable Sources.\"\"Brent had this ability to go anywhere, get any story, listen and communicate what was happening to people that others wouldn't otherwise see it. And it is a devastating loss to journalism today,\" he added.Putzel said Renaud was working on a documentary about refugees around the world when the crisis in Ukraine began. He said that \"Brent was on the plane the next day\" and covered the plight of refugees from Kyiv into Poland.Several years ago, the pair won a duPont award for a story they worked on about guns being smuggled into Mexico from the United States.\"What I said when we accepted our award was, the only thing bigger than Brent's balls are his heart. And I stand by that. That's what kind of journalist he was,\" said Putzel.Renaud had a unique ability to make people trust him as he told their stories in places like Iraq and other war zones, he added.\"You could sit down and spend a week watching all of Brent's stories over the years back-to-back and just be flabbergasted,\" Putzel said. \"The career that he had, his ability to reach people, his ability to capture the humanity behind people's suffering is something I have never seen before, and I was just honored to work with him as long as I did.\"\u2014 CNN's Clarissa Ward reported from Kyiv, Mick Krever reported from Poland, Brian Stelter reported from New York and Lauren Kent wrote in London.",

        "content": "(CNN)Police are offering a $10,000 reward after an armed suspect opened fire Saturday on two apparently homeless people who were sleeping on the streets of New York City, killing one and wounding the other.The shootings happened about 90 minutes apart in Lower Manhattan and were caught on surveillance footage, the New York Police Department said. Video of the first shooting shows a man who appeared to be homeless sleeping near the corner of King Street and Varick when an unknown suspect approached and shot him in his forearm, NYPD Deputy Chief Commanding Officer Henry Sautner said during a news conference. The man woke up and shouted, \"What are you doing?\" at the shooter, who then ran away, Sautner added. Police were called to the scene around 4:30 a.m. and the 38-year-old victim was taken to a hospital for treatment.New York police released surveillance photos of the unknown armed suspect who shot two men Saturday.A second shooting involving a person who was apparently homeless happened around 6:00 a.m. outside of 148 Lafayette Street, police said. Officers found the man in a sleeping bag with gunshot wounds to his head and neck, and he was pronounced dead at the scene, Sautner said.Read MoreVideo surveillance of this shooting shows a suspect approaching the sleeping victim and firing his weapon, police said. New York City Mayor Eric Adams called surveillance videos \"chilling\" and \"horrific,\" and said the shootings were \"an intentional act of taking a life of someone that appears because he was homeless.\"\"Watching the video, watching an individual intentionally walk up to innocent people that are dealing with the challenges of homelessness,\" Adams said. \"It is quite possible that one of our citizens is still alive merely because he woke up.\"The NYPD released images of the suspect from the surveillance footage and is asking the public to come forward with information. \"A combined reward in the amount of $10,000 is being offered,\" the NYPD said in a tweet. \"Up to $3,500 payable by @NYPDTips upon arrest and indictment and $6,500 payable by NYPD upon arrest and conviction of the person(s) responsible for this incident.\"New York City crime wave continues into 2022 as city rolls out safety plan The shootings come as the NYPD grapples with upticks across every major crime category in the city. Major crimes spiked nearly 60% in February compared to the same month in 2021, police data showed.New York City also recorded a 41% increase in overall major crime through the first months of 2022 compared to the same period last year, including a nearly 54% increase in robberies, a 56% increase in grand larceny incidents and a 22% increase in rape reports, the data shows.Murders increased by 10%, while citywide shooting incidents decreased by 1.3%, with 77 incidents in February 2021 and 76 incidents last month, NYPD data shows. Those living on the streets in New York \"are far more likely to be victims of violent crime than perpetrator,\" the Coalition for the Homeless said in a statement Sunday.City officials are working to get other homeless people into shelters, Adams said Sunday. \"We're also mobilizing on the streets to notify our homeless to try and get them in shelters, those who want to do so,\" Adams said. \"Being homeless should not turn into a homicide and I want to catch this guy bad.\" Adams unveiled his 'Blueprint to End Gun Violence' in January, which includes long-term goals to grow economic opportunities, improve child education and provide more access to mental health resources while addressing the gun crisis.CNN's Liam Reilly, Emma Tucker, Mark Morales and Laura Studley contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Patrons at New York City's Museum of Modern Art were evacuated Saturday afternoon after two employees were stabbed inside the iconic establishment by a man who was involved in two incidents of disorderly conduct  at the museum in recent days, police said.The two employees were stabbed in the back, the collar bone and in the back of the neck and were rushed to Bellevue Hospital within minutes of the attack. They received immediate medical attention and are expected to survive, said Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence and Counterterrorism John Miller during a news conference on Saturday evening.\"At approximately 4:15 this afternoon, an individual entered the museum, attempted to gain entrance presenting his membership card and was denied entrance because his membership had expired. His membership had expired as a result of two incidents involving disorderly conduct here at the museum on two separate dates in recent days,\" Miller said.Miller said upon being denied entrance to the museum, the suspect became angry and then jumped over the reception desk and attacked two museum employees, stabbing them multiple times.The NYPD is still searching for the suspect, who was identified in a news release early Sunday as 60-year-old Gary Cabana. Authorities had earlier described him as a man wearing a black jacket and surgical mask. His description was released immediately over division radio units in the area and a search was initiated by units responding to the vicinity of the scene, according to Miller.The NYPD released a series of photos of the man wanted for questioning in connection with the stabbings at MoMA Saturday.Read MoreThe suspect, who is a regular at the MoMA, entered the building Saturday with the intention of attending a film at the iconic landmark. He is known to the NYPD, Miller said, and is wanted by the department in connection with two incidents that occurred in Midtown Manhattan, where the museum is located, prior to Saturday's double stabbing. The man was caught on video leaving the museum and police have a direction of his flight, he added.\"The individual involved in this incident is known to us and we are endeavoring to locate this person right now,\" Miller said. The incident is still unfolding and the investigation is in its early stages, he said.The museum will be closed to the public Sunday, it said on social media.Mayor Eric Adams said he was briefed on the incident on Saturday and his press secretary tweeted it \"appears to be an isolated, criminal incident.\"\"We can report that the two victims are being taken care of at Bellevue Hospital and are expected to survive their injuries,\" Adams tweeted. \"We're grateful for the quick work of our first responders.\"Adams asked for the public's help in locating the individual, tweeting: \"Please continue to avoid the area while Police continue their investigation and if you have any information, please contact the NYPD immediately. Public safety is our top priority.\" New York City crime wave continues into 2022 as city rolls out safety plan In videos shared on social media, dozens of people are seen leaving the museum in a large crowd.  \"We weren't told what was going on, just that they had to close the exhibits immediately,\" MoMA patron Tina Rook told CNN. \"A woman did say it was an emergency,\" Rook said, adding the whole incident was handled very well by police and museum officials.    NYC's official emergency management agency informed residents of road closure and emergency personnel at the scene near West 53rd Street and 6th Avenue in Manhattan, according to a tweet on Saturday afternoon. Miller said there was ample security in the area at the time of the incident but described it as a \"rapidly unfolding spontaneous incident.\"The incident in the renowned New York museum occurred as the city experiences a continued wave of violent crime this year.  Mayor Eric Adams has begun implementing his comprehensive plan to combat gun violence and crime in the city. Part of the plan includes reviving the NYPD's controversial anti-crime unit. Neighborhood safety teams will be tasked with patrolling high-crime neighborhoods starting on Monday. The city recorded a 41% increase in overall major crime through the first months of 2022 compared to the same period last year, including a nearly 54% increase in robberies, a 56% increase in grand larceny incidents and a 22% increase in rape reports, the data shows. Adams unveiled his \"Blueprint to End Gun Violence\" in January, which includes long-term goals to grow economic opportunities, improve child education and provide more access to mental health resources while addressing the gun crisis.",

        "content": "(CNN)A suspect is in custody after five West Point cadets overdosed -- four of whom were hospitalized -- on the drug fentanyl while they were on spring break in Fort Lauderdale earlier this week, according to police.Authorities in Broward County, Florida, have made the arrest of the 21-year-old man in connection to the sale of a fentanyl-laced powder substance that allegedly triggered overdoses, according to CNN affiliate WPLG. The incident occurred in a vacation rental house in Wilton Manors, according to a news release from the Wilton Manors Police Department (WMPD).The Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue (FLFR) responded to the house around 5 p.m. Thursday and aided six men who were feeling overdose symptoms. A seventh patient, who is a woman, was later transported to the hospital after feeling sick, police said. A hazmat team tested the powdered material and found that it was laced with fentanyl, an opioid drug, according to the department.Read MorePolice said Friday that six West Point cadets on spring break in Fort Lauderdale were hospitalized after overdosing on a powder substance laced with the drug fentanyl. However, Lt. Col. Beth Smith, West Point director of public affairs and communications, told CNN on Saturday morning that only five of the six individuals involved in the overdose incident are cadets. Four of the cadets required hospitalization after the incident, according to Smith. According to the arrest report, Broward County Drug Task Force detectives responded to an overdose investigation involving multiple victims. Detectives were able to get the cellphone number \"of the alleged dealer who supplied the narcotics to the victims,\" as part of the investigation. An undercover detective made contact with Axel Giovany Casseus on Friday and \"purchased 43 grams of cocaine\" from him in exchange for $1,000, the report said. Casseus was later arrested on charges of trafficking cocaine.  During a Saturday bond hearing, a Broward County deputy identified Casseus as the man they believe sold the laced substance to the cadets and indicated that Casseus admitted to the transaction involving the West Point students after being taken into custody, according to the CNN-affiliate WPLG. Casseus is being held in the Broward County Jail in lieu of a $50,000 bond, according to BCSO online records. It is unclear whether he has an attorney. Police did not provide information on the suspect or the charges in Friday's press release.  The names of the patients have not been released, though police said the college students are from New York who were vacationing in Fort Lauderdale on spring break. \"This incident serves as a stark reminder to all, especially those visiting for Spring Break, of the deadly impacts of Fentanyl,\" Wilton Manors police said in the news release.Beth Smith, a spokesperson for the US Military Academy at West Point, acknowledged to CNN the college students were cadets and said the academy is investigating.Local authorities are investigating the overdose incident, police said.WMPD officers \"took precautionary measures by evacuating and securing the residence due to the unidentified powdery substance,\" said the press release. Drug overdose deaths top 100,000 annually for the first time, driven by fentanyl, CDC data showFentanyl is a synthetic drug that can be up to 50 times stronger than heroin, up to 100 times stronger than morphine and commonly resembles prescription drugs, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is often added to other drugs by dealers \"because of its extreme potency, which makes drugs cheaper, more powerful, more addictive, and more dangerous,\" the CDC said.On Friday, Wilton Manors police warned in a tweet about the dangers of fentanyl.\"WMPD wants to warn spring breakers about the dangers of using illicit drugs & to avoid mixing drugs with alcohol or other forms of drugs. Protect yourself from the dangers of Fentanyl,\" police said.Last year saw a record high of drug overdose deaths, with more than 100,000 people dying from April 2020 to April 2021, according to provisional data published in November by the CDC. It was a 28.5% spike compared to the same period a year earlier and nearly doubling over the past five years.",
