        "content": "A series of high-profile exits from Whitehall have not been matched by ministerial resignations\nThis week\u2019s resignations from the head of Ofqual, Sally Collier, and the department of education\u2019s permanent secretary, Jonathan Slater, are only the latest in a series of senior departures from Whitehall.\nBy contrast, no ministers have been sacked for any of the government\u2019s high-profile crises or scandals.\nSir Mark Sedwill\nThe cabinet secretary and the UK\u2019s most senior civil servant announced in June that he will step down in the autumn. Colleagues say he was unfairly blamed by Number 10 aides for ministerial failings over Brexit and coronavirus.\nSir Philip Rutnam\nThe home office\u2019s top civil servant resigned in February, alleging he had become the \u201ctarget of a vicious and orchestrated campaign\u201d coordinated by the home secretary, Priti Patel. He is taking Patel and the department to an employment tribunal under whistleblowing legislation, claiming he was forced out because he tried to stop her bullying staff. She denies any wrongdoing.\nSir Simon McDonald\nThe permanent secretary at the foreign office will step down early next year after anonymous briefings claimed he had clashed with Boris Johnson when he was foreign secretary. Along with Rutnam, McDonald\u2019s name was on a \u201chitlist\u201d of three permanent secretaries Downing Street wanted to replace which was reported by the Sunday Telegraph in February. Tom Scholar, the treasury\u2019s permanent secretary, survives.\nRichard Heaton\nThe Ministry of Justice\u2019s permanent secretary will step down this month, it was announced in July, following speculation that his contract would not be renewed as part of top No 10 aide Dominic Cummings\u2019s overhaul of senior Whitehall jobs.\nRobert Jenrick\nThe housing secretary shrugged off resignation calls after ensuring a controversial housing development was agreed before a new levy was introduced which would have cost millions for a Conservative donor.\nPriti Patel\nThe home secretary refused to go despite allegations from senior staff including Rutnam that she had bullied civil servants in three separate government departments. Johnson authorised a cabinet office inquiry into her alleged behaviour but it is still to be released to the public, months after it was handed to the prime minister\u2019s office.\nGavin Williamson\nThe education secretary, who was forced to resign as defence secretary last year after leaking information from the National Security Council, has faced a chorus of demands from senior Conservatives to do so again over the exams fiasco.\nThe former chief whip said he was \u201cincredibly sorry for the distress\u201d caused, but former minister George Freeman said the \u201cexam shambles\u201d raised \u201cworrying\u201d questions about leadership in the department.\nMatt Hancock\nThe government\u2019s much-criticised handling of the pandemic led critics of the health secretary to wonder whether he would be the Cabinet minister to face the chop. He hasn\u2019t.",

        "content": "Court says Britain must supply intelligence on Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh after US drops death penalty\nA US trial of two members of Islamic State accused of taking part in the beheading of hostages appears likely to go ahead, following a legal ruling that allows the UK to share evidence with US prosecutors.\nBritain\u2019s supreme court said on Wednesday that a stay preventing the Home Office from supplying intelligence relating to Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh must be lifted after the US said it would drop death penalty charges against them.\nThe Home Office said it would not comment on what it would do next, but the UK is expected to share evidence that US prosecutors have said they believe is vital for a trial to take place.\nThere may, however, be a last-minute legal challenge to try to prevent the two countries from cooperating.\nKotey, 36, and Elsheikh, 32, two members of a notorious gang of four Britons that hostages nicknamed \u201cthe Beatles\u201d, left the UK to join Isis soon after it emerged in Syria and Iraq. They have been accused of involvement in the gruesome killings of four US citizens and two Britons, which were filmed and broadcast online six years ago.\nThe victims were the British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, the US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and the US aid workers Peter Kassig and Kayla Mueller, who was also tortured and sexually abused.\nFamilies representing the victims have campaigned for the two men to be put on trial in the US, urging the authorities to drop the death penalty charge so that Britain can cooperate fully with them.\nSotloff\u2019s father, Art, told NBC News he was pleased \u201cour governments are finally working with each other\u201d. Mueller\u2019s parents are due to address the Republican convention on Thursday evening.\nThe US attorney general, William Barr, wrote to the British home secretary, Priti Patel, last week to confirm that his country would not pursue the death penalty in return for British cooperation before a deadline of 15 October.\n\u201cFurther delay is no longer possible if Kotey and Elsheikh are to be tried in the United States, and the further delay is an injustice to the families of the victims,\u201d Barr wrote.\nThe Home Office said at the time that it welcomed the development and that it continued to work closely with its international partners to ensure that those who have committed crimes in the name of Isis were brought to justice.\nThe two men are being held in Iraq for several months after the US military removed them from Syria, where Kurdish forces had been holding them. Barr had said that if the UK did not assist by 15 October, Washington would hand the pair over to the Iraqi judicial system instead.\nThe UK does not normally cooperate with prosecutions brought by other countries if the death penalty is a possibility, although in 2018 the then home secretary Sajid Javid said he was willing to waive the requirement in the case of the two men.\nThe supreme court, however, ruled in March that his actions had been unlawful following an appeal from Elsheikh\u2019s mother, Maha Elgizouli. Her lawyers had argued the two should be put on trial in the UK instead, something the British authorities refused to do. Both Kotey and Elsheikh were stripped of their British citizenship in 2018.\nThe most infamous member of the Beatles cell was Mohammed Emwazi, who was killed in a US drone strike in 2015. A fourth member, Aine Davis, is in prison in Turkey after being jailed for seven years in 2017 for serving Isis.",

        "content": "Leicester held on in the battle to avoid being tagged the club that would have been relegated but for Saracens\u2019 disgrace, but even in victory their new head coach, Steve Borthwick, witnessed how far the most successful English club in the professional era have fallen.\nThe Tigers spent the final minutes hanging on having been 13-0 up with 20 minutes to go. They had three tries disallowed, two for infringements in the buildup, and despite showing the greater initiative, they were bedevilled by a lack of confidence. They remain one place off the bottom of the table, three points behind Worcester and five behind Irish.\nLeicester paraded the Fiji wing Nemani Nadolo for the first time. The 32-year-old recruit from Montpellier and former Crusader was marked by Tom Parton, who conceded about eight stone in weight and six inches in height. The first time Parton touched the ball, he dared not try to go through Nadolo but found it took a considerable time to go around an opponent who seemed to cast as long a shadow as the Breedon stand and got nowhere.\nNadolo flattened Parton the first time he received the ball, but he was armed with far more than brute force and played a key role in the opening try on 21 minutes. Tom Youngs had just had a score ruled out when a review concluded he had not grounded the ball after George Martin had hijacked a London Irish throw-in five metres out.\nLeicester\u2019s early dominance was fed by a supply of penalties from the breakdown, where Tommy Reffell was supreme, and the tight. They looked to have messed up the scrum awarded after Youngs was denied by Ben Donnell, but Nadolo came into midfield to tidy up and created an overlap with a pass out of the back of his left hand that gave David Williams the space to score in the corner.\nTom Woolstencroft enjoyed a dream first outing with the Saracens captaincy by scoring a hat-trick of tries in their 36-20 victory over Gloucester at Allianz Park.\u00a0The hooker, standing in in the absence of Brad Barritt, delivered a standout performance by dotting down three times in 20 minutes, while a Ben Harris try on his debut and Tom Whiteley's effort capped the win.\u00a0Stephen Varney, Henry Walker and Louis Rees-Zammit did notch tries for the visitors but Saracens proved too good in the second half to secure their 11th league win of the season and leave Gloucester eighth.\nWorcester blew a huge hole in Harlequins' play-off hopes by posting an impressive 29-14 victory at Sixways.\u00a0The Warriors forwards were in unstoppable form, with Worcester scoring three first-half tries direct from driving mauls to underpin a first Premiership win of 2020. The No 8\u00a0Cornell Du Preez, the centre Ollie Lawrence and the hooker Niall Annett all touched down before scrum-half Francois Hougaard's 39th-minute score secured a bonus-point and Duncan Weir kicked three conversions before adding a second-half penalty.Quins, 11 points adrift of the play-offs before kick-off, trailed 26-0 at the break, and there was no way back. The wing Chris Ashton and the hooker Elia Elia claimed consolation tries for Quins, with James Lang adding both conversions, but Worcester were already over the horizon.\nIt put the Tigers 10-0 ahead after George Ford\u2019s early penalty but Leicester, not for the first time, lost their way and spent much of the rest of the opening half in their 22. Leicester\u2019s passing had been smooth and sharp but Irish were laboured in their movement, often operating from deep and quickly closed down.\nIt was very much a meeting of two teams at the wrong end of the table, a mess of knock-ons, scrums and resets. Leicester were hampered by the loss of two second-rows in the opening half, Harry Wells failing a head injury assessment and his replacement, Martin, lasting 17 minutes before limping off, but a game that would have dripped with tension had relegation been an issue was largely ritual.\nLeicester extended their 10-point interval lead with Ford\u2019s second penalty after Henry Elrington collapsed another scrum. Nadolo had a try ruled out because Ellis Genge\u2019s pass to the wing as he made an inside run was deflected forward by Luke Wallace.\nLeicester later had a third try ruled out, Reffell denied by Nephi Leatigaga\u2019s obstruction on Ben Meehan. Irish were by then back in the game, taking advantage of Calum Green\u2019s absence in the sin-bin for not rolling away on his line to win a series of scrums that concluded with Meehan forcing his way over.\nIrish finished as they started, wasting positions by leaving tackled players isolated on an evening that highlighted a consequence of ring\u2011fencing the top flight.",

        "content": "Hogan\u2019s resignation comes after Irish government signalled it wanted him to quit or be sacked\nThe embattled European trade commissioner, Phil Hogan, has resigned his post after an outcry over his breaches of coronavirus rules during a golfing break in Ireland.\nHogan issued a statement on Wednesday night apologising to the Irish people and the EU commission for causing hurt and embarrassment, ending his attempts to ride out the controversy and keep his post as a key player in Brexit talks.\n\u201cIt was becoming increasingly clear that the controversy concerning my recent visit to Ireland was becoming a distraction from my work as an EU commissioner and would undermine my work in the key months ahead,\u201d said the statement.\n\u201cI deeply regret that my trip to Ireland \u2013 the country that I have been so proud to represent as a public servant for most of my adult life \u2013 caused such concern, unease and upset.\u201d He admitted breaching Covid guidelines but denied breaking any law.\nAsked in an RTE interview if the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, forced him out, Hogan said it was his decision to quit: \u201cI resigned myself. I know how to take responsibility.\u201d\nVon der Leyen tweeted that she respected his decision and was grateful for his work.\nTonight Commissioner @PhilHoganEU submitted his resignation. I respect his decision. I am grateful for his work as a Trade Commissioner and a member of my team. https://t.co/xPcdLX3kmy\nThe leaders of Ireland\u2019s three governing parties welcomed the resignation in a joint statement. \u201cWe believe that it is the correct course of action given the circumstances of the past week. We all have a responsibility to support and adhere to public health guidelines and regulations.\u201d\nEarlier on Wednesday the government signaled it wanted Hogan to quit or be sacked after concluding he flouted coronavirus regulations. The taoiseach, Miche\u00e1l Martin, said Hogan had undermined public confidence in public health guidelines.\nHogan\u2019s fate rested in the hands of his boss, Von der Leyen, who requested a full account of his movements in Ireland.\nShe was under pressure to sack the commissioner, an Irish political veteran who moved to Brussels and became the EU\u2019s key figure in Brexit talks, but doing so would have set an awkward precedent.\nThe Irish public has seethed at revelations about Hogan\u2019s behaviour but some business groups fear Ireland will lose a key ally in Brexit talks. The head of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association compared ousting Hogan to \u201ccutting off our Brexit nose to spite our Covid face\u201d.\nIreland\u2019s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, has been tipped to replace Hogan as Ireland\u2019s EU commissioner. David O\u2019Sullivan, who served as the EU\u2019s ambassador to Washington, has also been tipped.\nDublin hopes to retain the trade portfolio at a pivotal time for Brexit and US trade talks but that will be a decision for Von der Leyen.\nHogan attempted to defuse public anger and save his job on Tuesday by publishing a timeline of his movements in Ireland from 31 July to 22 August, and gave about 20 pages of documents with additional details to Von der Leyen.\nThe row erupted after it emerged the commissioner joined more than 80 people, including politicians and a supreme court judge, at a golfing dinner in Clifden, County Galway, on 19 August.\nThe event breached Covid-19 regulations and prompted public outrage. Several attendees resigned from their positions, including Dara Calleary, the government\u2019s agriculture minister. Police are investigating the event.\nHogan admitted the gathering was wrong and he should not have attended but initially refused to resign, insisting he respected regulations during the rest of his three-week visit to Ireland. Drip-drip disclosures, however, undermined that claim.\nHe said he had arrived in Ireland on 31 July and travelled to his temporary residence in county Kildare before being admitted on 5 August to a Dublin hospital, where he tested negative for Covid-19 before being discharged on 7 August.\nHe returned to Kildare, which was in lockdown because of a surge in infections, and over the next two weeks visited counties Limerick, Roscommon, Kilkenny and Galway before returning to Brussels.\nHowever as a traveller from Belgium, a high-risk country, rules state he should have remained in self-isolation even after a negative test.",

Plus: Australia to be the \u2018Saudi Arabia of renewable energy\u2019\nGood morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 27 August.\nA 17-year-old is in police custody in the United States after the shooting deaths of two protesters engaging in Black Lives Matter demonstrations in Wisconsin, with the state governor announcing that 500 more national guards will be brought in as street protests entered a third night. Witnesses allege the teenage shooter was part of a \u201cmilitia\u201d of heavily armed counter-protesters, with footage posted on social media capturing the shooting. The city of Kenosha has been rocked by protests since the shooting of Jacob Blake by police that has left the 29-year-old \u201cfighting for his life\u201d. The two protest victims, a 26-year-old and a 36-year old, both from Wisconsin, have not yet been identified.\nA failure to implement  workforce pandemic plans in privately operated aged care facilities is a major factor behind the devastating rates of Covid-19 among Victorian healthcare workers, the nurses\u2019 union has said, with at least 2,799 professionals infected during the state\u2019s second wave. Only 6% of those affected acquired the disease outside of the workplace, investigations have found \u2013 in contrast to government claims that most infections had occurred in the community. Elsewhere, the aged care royal commission has found that the sector would require $621m in funding per year to lift all facilities to \u201cbasic standards\u201d, with $3.2bn a year required to reach a sector-wide \u201chigh-quality\u201d standard. A health governance report has also slammed Australia\u2019s economic response to Covid-19, arguing it fails to address insecure work, privatised services such as aged care, low housing supply and climate change. And as Greg Jericho writes, the tentative Australian economic recovery appears to have stalled.\nRussia is preparing to approve a second vaccine against Covid-19 by late September or early October, deputy prime minister Tatiana Golikova has announced. Russia\u2019s claims that a first vaccine, called Sputnik V, is already safe and effective has been met with international scepticism, with the Kremlin announcing it will be rolled out to 40,000 during final trials before its international availability. In Croatia, the summer tourism season has been blamed for the Balkan nation recording its highest number of daily coronavirus infections \u2013 358 new cases \u2013 while France has recorded 5,429 cases overnight. A new study meanwhile has suggested that obesity increases the chances of dying from Covid-19 by nearly 50%, and could also reduce the effectiveness of vaccines.\nStaff at RMIT University have expressed concern over millions of dollars of funding going to a blockchain research body \u2013 the technology behind cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin \u2013 with strong links to the rightwing thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs.\nFinancial giant HSBC has teamed up to create what it is calling the world\u2019s largest investment firm dedicated to \u201cnatural capital\u201d projects, with a view to helping meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement through \u201cinvesting in the resilience of nature\u201d.\nUK Labour has criticised reports that Boris Johnson is preparing to appoint Tony Abbott as a post-Brexit UK trade envoy, with the shadow trade secretary, Emily Thornberry, calling the former prime minister a \u201cTrump-worshipping misogynist\u201d.\nUp to half of the world\u2019s water supply is stolen by agricultural companies and farmers every year, a major international study led by Australian researchers has found. A lack of enforceable punishments has been cited as a key driver of ongoing theft.\nBrussels has denounced a \u201ccompletely wasted\u201d summer in terms of Brexit negotiations, with Germany cancelling discussions on the topic at a major diplomatic meeting next week due to a lack of \u201cany tangible progress\u201d.\nA celebrity congresswoman in Brazil is facing assassination charges of her husband, who was also once her adopted son.

But rather than succumb to nightmares, Doyle is now using the encounter to defend sharks and help fundraise for better marine protection, writes Graham Readfearn.\nThe Western Australian town of Kalbarri might be postcard perfect but there\u2019s no jobs.

Two strikers bought by the club, Patryk Klimala and Albian Ajeti, were named as substitutes. \u201cThe game was actually a lot easier than what I thought it was going to be but we didn\u2019t take our chances,\u201d said Lennon. \u201cWe had plenty of them.\n\u201cThe first goal we can maybe legislate for a little bit, the second goal is really poor decision-making. It\u2019s individual mistakes. It\u2019s cost us against Copenhagen [in last season\u2019s Europa League] and it\u2019s cost us again tonight.\nIt\u2019s not fine going out at this stage of the competition because we\u2019re better than that.\n\u201cI\u2019m devastated. That shouldn\u2019t happen. We all have to take responsibility, certainly I do for the team selection but we had enough chances to win that game twice over.\u201d",

        "content": "In what was shaping up to be an advert for why less is more when it comes to domestic rugby, a handful of England hopefuls eventually put themselves in the international shop window and catapulted Bath to a third straight Premiership victory since the restart.\nThe wing Ruaridh McConnochie came off the bench to score the decisive try and give the watching Eddie Jones a timely reminder of his talents, while the scrum-half Ben Spencer, another replacement, also put down a marker for an England spot this autumn.\nThe man of the match, meanwhile, was Beno Obano, the gregarious loosehead prop who has been on the fringes of international recognition, only for injury to strike. Clearly he is flourishing with Neal Hatley as coach.\nA cagey battle between fifth and sixth was already beginning to swing in Bath\u2019s favour after the 20-year-old fullback Tom de Glanville \u2013 the son of the former England captain Phil \u2013 produced a fine finish under considerable pressure for the first try of the match. He was injured in the process, replaced and required further attention to a worrying looking head/neck injury. His intervention, on his first Premiership start, was just as important as McConnochie\u2019s that settled matters.\n\u201cWe are making sure we look after Tom the best we can. He took a hit, credit for him for scoring the try, but thoughts are with him at the moment,\u201d said the Bath director of rugby, Stuart Hooper.\nMcConnochie\u2019s try was more opportunist, capitalising on Sam Matavesi\u2019s mistake to race clear, but having not featured for England since last year\u2019s World Cup he will be delighted Jones was in attendance to see it. All the more so because it made sure Northampton, now on a losing run of five matches at home, were put to bed and moved Bath up into fourth place.\nTom Woolstencroft enjoyed a dream first outing with the Saracens captaincy by scoring a hat-trick of tries in their 36-20 victory over Gloucester at Allianz Park.\u00a0The hooker, standing in in the absence of Brad Barritt, delivered a standout performance by dotting down three times in 20 minutes, while a Ben Harris try on his debut and Tom Whiteley's effort capped the win.\u00a0Stephen Varney, Henry Walker and Louis Rees-Zammit did notch tries for the visitors but Saracens proved too good in the second half to secure their 11th league win of the season and leave Gloucester eighth.\nWorcester blew a huge hole in Harlequins' play-off hopes by posting an impressive 29-14 victory at Sixways.\u00a0The Warriors forwards were in unstoppable form, with Worcester scoring three first-half tries direct from driving mauls to underpin a first Premiership win of 2020. The No 8\u00a0Cornell Du Preez, the centre Ollie Lawrence and the hooker Niall Annett all touched down before scrum-half Francois Hougaard's 39th-minute score secured a bonus-point and Duncan Weir kicked three conversions before adding a second-half penalty.Quins, 11 points adrift of the play-offs before kick-off, trailed 26-0 at the break, and there was no way back. The wing Chris Ashton and the hooker Elia Elia claimed consolation tries for Quins, with James Lang adding both conversions, but Worcester were already over the horizon.\nWith Northampton changing all 15 of their starting lineup and Bath 13 it was an understandably sloppy start, dreadful for the first hour, and certainly not an endorsement of midweek matches. Bath eked out a 3-0 lead when a man up, with Josh Matavesi on target with a penalty. JJ Tonks was sent to the sin-bin when the referee, Christophe Ridley, adjudged the Northampton flanker to have made a dangerous tackle on Zach Mercer.\nDan Biggar missed his first attempt for Saints but was on the money with his second \u2013 in truth he could not miss from right in front of the posts, capitalising on a period of pressure that led to their hulking wing Taqele Naiyaravoro blasting through Mike Williams.\nIn the second half it was Naiyaravoro again, off his left wing, who burst through a gap but once more a combination of white-line fever for Northampton and resolute Bath defence kept the score at 3-3.\nHaving kept their hosts at bay, Bath turned to their bench and it had the desired impact. Spencer\u2019s box-kick was fumbled by Ahsee Tuala and the ball was worked to De Glanville, who just about managed to get it down in the left-hand corner despite the efforts of Tommy Freeman and Rory Hutchinson.\nNorthampton kept plugging away but as the clock ticked down increasingly they tried to force the issue and McConnochie, showing no little dexterity, pounced on the loose ball to streak clear for a fifth try in his past six matches. Rhys Priestland\u2019s penalty only served to rub salt into Saints\u2019 wounds.",

        "content": "Jed Rubenfeld confirmed he had been suspended and faced further teaching restrictions following two-year investigation\nA prominent law professor at Yale Law School who once argued that modern views about sexual consent encouraged people to think of themselves as sexual assault victims has been suspended for two years following an investigation by the university that he sexually harassed students.\nJed Rubenfeld, who is married to Amy Chua, a fellow Yale law professor and bestselling author of the parenting guide Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, confirmed to the Guardian that he had been suspended and faced further restrictions on his teaching following a two-year internal investigation into his interactions with students.\nNew York magazine first reported news of the suspension.\nRubenfeld acknowledged that the Yale University investigation included an examination of claims that he inappropriately touched students, made harassing remarks, and attempted kissing. It also examined an allegation that he had once offered to drive students home while he was under the influence of alcohol.\nA spokesperson for Yale University declined to comment on the case. It would not confirm that Rubenfeld had been suspended, or the reason for his suspension. It declined to comment on the university\u2019s lack of transparency and declined to comment on whether students had been barred from speaking to the press about their experiences.\nOne person who attended Yale Law who had previously and anonymously spoken about the inquiry to the Guardian said she could not discuss the matter.\nIn an interview with the Guardian, Rubenfeld, whose faculty page has been removed, said he had made remarks and \u201cjokes\u201d in his 3o-year teaching career that he now regretted, but categorically denied he had every sexually harassed anyone \u201cverbally or otherwise\u201d and that he had never engaged in \u201cunwanted sexual touching or attempted kissing\u201d. He also denied ever having offered to drive a student home while he was intoxicated.\n\u201cIt is just false and outrageous and not true,\u201d he said of all the allegations.\nWhen he was asked by the Guardian if he had ever engaged in a sexual relationship with any Yale students, Rubenfeld denied that he had ever had sex with his own students. He declined to comment further.\nThe news comes two years after Yale Law faced a backlash from students for its initial support of Brett Kavanaugh, the supreme court justice and Yale Law graduate who has faced multiple allegations of sexual assault. Kavanaugh denied the claims.\nThe development is significant because of the role Rubenfeld and Chua \u2013 who have been described as a power couple on the Yale Law campus \u2013 have played at the university.\nIn 2018, when the Guardian first reported news that Rubenfeld was facing an investigation into sexual harassment claims, sources who spoke anonymously said there was concern among some students that any attempt to complain or report allegations of Rubenfeld\u2019s inappropriate behavior could lead to retaliation by Rubenfeld or Chua.\nChua previously served on a committee that helped students to secure highly sought-after clerkships with supreme court justices and other senior judges, including Kavanaugh, giving her a powerful role within the law school.\nIn a statement to the Guardian, Chua said she could not comment on \u201cJed\u2019s issues\u201d and said her own role at Yale \u201cwas not raised at all in the course of the investigation about Jed. No one called me or questioned me, and I don\u2019t believe anyone mentioned me in the proceedings.\u201d\nShe added that she believed her classes were \u201camong the most popular at law school, especially for women and minorities\u201d and that she had been nominated for a Yale Law Women Teaching award in 2019.\nIn 2018, the Guardian reported that Chua had privately told a group of law students a year earlier that it was \u201cnot an accident\u201d that Kavanaugh\u2019s female law clerks all \u201clooked like models\u201d. The Guardian also reported that Chua sometimes provided advice to students about their physical appearance if they wanted to work for Kavanaugh. Chua at the time denied making the statements.\nRubenfeld and Chua\u2019s daughter served as a clerk for Kavanaugh about one year after Chua wrote a glowing op-ed about Kavanaugh in which she described him as a \u201cmentor to women\u201d in the Wall Street Journal.\nWhen asked whether she still helped secure clerkships for Yale students, Chua told the Guardian she had voluntarily given up the role.\n\u201cIt was actually a pleasure to step back \u2013 it was so much work! Especially because I went to enormous lengths to help place students from state schools or marginalized backgrounds that many judges tended to overlook. I never wanted to be on the committee, but the dean at the time begged me to serve on it, again because I had such success with historically unrepresented groups,\u201d she told the Guardian.\nGot a tip?

        "content": "Following guidelines associated with 7% lower mortality risk and 30% cut in carbon emissions\nSticking to official dietary advice, including the five-a-day maxim, could reduce the chance of premature death by an estimated 7% as well as help the environment, a study has suggested.\nHowever, it found that while many people are able to follow some of the guidelines, next to no one follows them all.\nThe first analysis of nine government-backed Eatwell dietary guidelines found that those who adhered to five or more of them had an estimated 7% reduction in their mortality risk.\nThe research, led by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, in collaboration with the University of Oxford, suggested a similar diet was associated with a 30% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, compared with those that adhered to two or fewer.\n\u201cOur study demonstrates that the Eatwell Guide forms an effective first step towards more healthy and sustainable diets in the UK,\u201d said Dr Pauline Scheelbeek, assistant professor in nutritional and environmental epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and the study\u2019s lead author.\n\u201cFurther adherence to the guidelines would not only result in population health benefits, but is also associated with lower environmental footprint due to reduced greenhouse gas emission.\u201d\nProf Alan Dangour, the study\u2019s senior author, added: \u201cOur new analysis demonstrates that following the Eatwell Guide would substantially improve human health in the UK and reduce our nation\u2019s footprint on the planet.\u201d\nThe guidelines, which were published in 2016, recommend that people eat at least five portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables per day, as well as base meals of potatoes, bread, rice, pasta or other starchy carbohydrates and drink six to eight glasses of fluids per day.\nThe advice also calls for diets to include dairy and sources of protein, such as beans and oily fish, and for people to choose unsaturated oils and spreads and eat fewer foods high in fat.\nRecommended low-calorie snacks that would adhere to the guidelines include a cheese and tomato toastie using crispbread, baked beans on toast and homemade popcorn.\nThe researchers found that the most marked improvement in mortality risk \u2013 when adhered to alone \u2013 was the consumption of fruit and vegetables. That reduced the estimated risk by 10%, they said in the study, which appears in BMJ Open and was funded by the Wellcome Trust.\nDespite the benefits, data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey suggest that less than 0.1% of the population is able to adhere to all nine guidelines. The data showed that 44% of people are able to follow three or four of the recommendations, with the consumption of dietary fibre and oily fish being the least commonly met category.\nOne of the most important environmental factors is the consumption of red or processed meat, which contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. The authors said their study indicated that limiting that and eating more beans, pulses and sustainably sourced fish instead would have a significant impact.\nHowever, Scheelbeek said that \u201cmore transformational dietary shifts than those recommended in the Eatwell Guide will be necessary if we want to meet the Paris agreement targets\u201d.\nShe said: \u201cThe Eatwell Guide does not specifically target environmental sustainability of diets. We therefore need to investigate ways to further reduce environmental footprints of our diets in ways that would be culturally acceptable and could be implemented by the UK population, both from a consumption and a production side, without compromising population health.\u201d",

She referred to \u201cstrong rigorous environmental standards\u201d that had \u201cbuy-in across the board\u201d.\n\u201cShe should stay true to her word and not pursue amendments until the standards are negotiated and made available to the people of Australia.\u201d\nButler said there would be concern if the Morrison government introduced legislation similar to the Coalition\u2019s one-stop-shop proposal that was defeated in 2015.\nLabor, the Greens and some of the crossbench have expressed alarm that changes to laws are being rushed before Samuel has handed down his final report, due in October.\nGovernment and One Nation senators voted to block a Greens motion on Wednesday that would have prevented the government\u2019s bill from being debated in the Senate until the final report is delivered or a consultative committee discussing the development of national standards reached agreement.\nGuardian Australia asked Ley if the government planned to meet its commitment to introduce prototype standards at the same time as its streamlining bill.\n\u201cThe bilateral agreements will include commonwealth standards,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cThere will be further legislation as a result of Professor Samuel\u2019s consultation process.\u201d\nRachel Walmsley, the policy and law reform director at the Environmental Defenders Office, said a potential outcome was that national standards would be attached as an appendix to each bilateral agreement as those agreements were negotiated with the states.\n\u201cFrom a legal point of view, that\u2019s very concerning,\u201d she said. \u201cGraeme Samuel\u2019s interim report said that national standards will be regulatory instruments with regulatory functions.\n\u201cThat\u2019s different to something that is an appendix to an agreement. For that to actually have (legal) force, the only recourse there would be for the minister to exercise a call-in power or for the minister to suspend accreditation.\u201d\nWalmsley said a bill that simply moved to streamline and fast-track development approvals would not bring the improvements Samuel\u2019s report found were necessary to stem an unsustainable rate of environmental decline.\nThe report recommended three phases for reform, beginning with interim standards and steps to establish bilateral processes.\nThe final phase called for a complete overhaul of the act with \u201ca full suite of national environmental standards\u201d, an independent law enforcement regulator, and systems that protect and restore the environment.\n\u201cAll of that could be completely undermined if a bill goes through now that hands power to the states with no enforceable standards or safeguards,\u201d Walmsley said.\nThe Greens environment spokeswoman, Sarah Hanson-Young, said Australians wanted to see the country\u2019s environment protected.\n\u201cWe should not be dealing with any of this legislation until we have a copy of that final report,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about good process, it\u2019s about scrutiny and it\u2019s about protecting Australia\u2019s environment.\u201d\nSenator Rex Patrick said he believed the government should wait until the final report was released before bringing legislation for debate.\n\u201cBefore being asked to vote on any amendments to the EPBC Act it\u2019s important that senators are well informed,\u201d he said. \u201cAs such, we should have access to the final independent review before any vote takes place.\u201d",

It is a perilous time, with no end in sight to the Covid-19 crisis while trainers are desperate to persuade their patrons to reinvest at sales like the one that took place in Newmarket this week.\nMorley sent eight horses to that sale, following the seven he sold last month, as part of a determined effort to reduce the number he and his mother Julia have in training. He is not getting out of the game but his patience with the poor return from prize money is wearing thin and, troublingly for those who love the sport, he is certain that other owners feel the same.\n\u201cI\u2019m selling more than I normally would,\u201d Morley said on Wednesday. \u201cI think we were on about 37 before July so we\u2019re going to be down to just over 20 after this week. It\u2019s going to go down from that.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been a tough game, to get winners, to juggle the finances so that it\u2019s not a complete drain, and I quite relish the challenge of outperforming. But right now I think you can be the best out there and you\u2019re still going to get absolutely mullered, cash-wise. I don\u2019t mind not being rewarded for doing things badly but if you do things really well, to get no reward is hard.\u201d\nMorley revealed last month that his investment in racing had led to a net loss of \u00a3350,000 for the first half of this year, not including sums paid for buying horses. A single-figure number of owners have won more than the 16 races bagged by the Morleys so far this year, so the news that he is disenchanted and scaling back ought to matter a great deal. While the Covid-19 crisis has made matters worse, his complaint is that British prize money has long struggled to compete with what is on offer elsewhere.\n\u201cI\u2019ve bitten my tongue and I try to keep myself to myself most of the time,\u201d Morley adds. \u201cI don\u2019t go racing really and I don\u2019t shout very loud. I don\u2019t do it for attention, that\u2019s not my type of thing, so I\u2019ve found it quite tricky to put my head above the parapet and talk about it a bit more.\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally unsustainable, that\u2019s the bottom line. I haven\u2019t got the answers but I\u2019m not paid to come up with the answers.\u201d\nMorley says that, despite being a significant investor in the sport over 20 years and a winner of top-class races at Royal Ascot, he is never consulted by racing\u2019s power-brokers about possible changes and his attendance is not sought by racecourses where he is due to have runners. It seems a shocking insight, at a time when keeping owners happy has never been so important.\nOf his trainers, Stuart Williams and Robert Cowell, Morley says: \u201cI have real sympathy for them and I know they will be badly affected if I cut down but I am gonna cut down because I\u2019m so fucked off. It does worry me and I would feel sorry if they have to lay off staff but I\u2019m not a charity and I can\u2019t keep donating money to a dustbin. I\u2019m really frustrated.\n\u201cI\u2019m not whingeing at all. The money\u2019s gone, it was my choice to spend it. My point is, this is the real state of play in racing and it is not going to last.\n\u201cI would have thought I will still have some horses. But if it proves that it doesn\u2019t work, even at a lower level ... I don\u2019t need horse racing in my life. Did I miss it when it wasn\u2019t on? No, not at all. Apart from the bills that kept landing on my desk.\n\u201cI think the yearling sales will be interesting, maybe the dream will keep a few people going. But for used horses, I think they will be venturing abroad.\u201d\nHaving opened at 20-1 last night, Viking Hoard (2.20) is now a more restrained (but still interesting) 8-1 for a Sedgefield handicap hurdle. Though he didn\u2019t show his ability every time when trained by Charles Byrnes in Ireland, he clearly had enough to be winning a race like this off his current rating.\nHe fared less well for a County Down yard last year, as a result of which his rating tumbled. Now he races for the first time in 10 months but is still young enough, at six, to be getting involved after a long absence. His new trainer, Micky Hammond, was unlucky not to get a win on Sunday with another handicapper making his debut for the yard, at 40-1.\nSedgefield\u00a012.20 Mukhtoon 12.50 Marine One 1.20 Timoshenko 1.50 Brotherly Company 2.20 Viking Hoard (nap) 2.50 Kitty's Light 3.25 Swaffham Bulbeck 4.00 Buckled 4.30 Grey Frontieres\nChelmsford12.40 Blue Beret 1.10 Ropey Guest 1.40 Pull Harder Con 2.10 Superiority 2.40 El Ghazwani 3.10 La Foglietta 3.45 Flying Standard 4.15 Champs De RevesBeverley\u00a01.00 Il Bandito 1.30 USS Nimitz 2.00 King's Knight 2.30 Shawaamekh 3.00 Society Queen 3.30 Keep Busy 4.05 Throne Hall 4.35 Artistic Vision 5.05 Prince AlexLingfield3.20 Tanfantic 3.55 Premier Power 4.25 Arsonist 4.55 Deadly Accurate (nb) 5.25 Crystal Carole 6.00 Dusk 6.30 Speech Room 7.00 Illustrious Spirit 7.30 Global Acclamation\nChristian Williams sends Kitty\u2019s Light (2.50) on a long journey to follow up his Southwell win of three weeks ago.

He added: \u201cThe health secretary has already said that he couldn\u2019t live on statutory sick pay (SSP) at \u00a395 a week. So how can an announcement like this work?\n\u201cFor many workers in Greater Manchester, this will not provide the support people need to cooperate with NHS test and trace. Having belatedly acknowledged that something needs to be done, government must now accept the calls of the \u2018time out to help out\u2019 campaign and support people across the country to self-isolate on full pay.\u201d\nTo be eligible for the scheme, a person must show proof of employment or self-employment, be unable to work from home, and be receiving universal credit or working tax credit.\nThere had been intense lobbying behind the scenes with many senior figures involved with test and trace, including its leader, Dido Harding, thought to have been sympathetic to concerns that low-paid workers could not afford to self-isolate.\nIt is understood the issue was raised with Cabinet Office officials last week on a visit to Oldham, where they were told that it was a huge barrier for some.\nMillions of low-paid workers either do not qualify for the statutory sick pay of \u00a395.85 a week or cannot afford to live on the allowance, leaving them unable to pay their bills if they have to quarantine.\nIn Germany, people who have to quarantine are paid their regular wage for seven weeks. Thereafter they get 70% of their salary in sickness pay. In China, people asked to self-isolate at home for two weeks have all their rent, food and bills covered by the government.\nThe health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: \u201cThe British public have already sacrificed a great deal to help slow the spread of the virus. Self-isolating if you have tested positive for Covid-19, or have come into contact with someone who has, remains vital to keeping on top of local outbreaks.\n\u201cThis new payment scheme will help people on low incomes and who are unable to work from home to continue playing their part in the national fight against this virus.\u201d\nIndividuals will have to either have tested positive for coronavirus or have been asked to self-isolate by NHS test and trace to be eligible for the payment. They will then need to prove the necessary evidence of their notification, and a bank statement.\nPayments will be provided within 48 hours of providing the necessary evidence. If the trial proves successful, it will be rolled out quickly to other areas with high infection rates.\n The headline of this article was corrected on 27 August 2020. The scheme only applies to England, not the UK.",

        "content": "Roomier rural houses are selling quickest, says Zoopla, with buyers prioritising space\nDemand for houses has soared since the lockdown ended, according to a report from Zoopla, with three- and four-bedroom houses with space to work from home particularly popular.\nProperties are selling far faster than before the pandemic struck, the report said, as buyers flooded back to the market. The amount of time a home is put up for sale before it finds a buyer has fallen to just 27 days since restrictions were eased, compared to 39 days over the same period in 2019.\nBig homes in the countryside are shifting fastest, while urban flats typically aimed at first-time buyers are now the slowest market segment.\n\u201cFour- and five-bed houses are selling 33% faster than in 2019, as buyers prioritise more space and widen their search criteria \u2013 migrating away from the more expensive cities, suburbs and commuter belts while enabling their budgets to stretch further. Meanwhile, flats are taking the longest time to sell,\u201d the property website said.\nIt said that sales of houses listed on its platform are 76% higher than the five year average, driven by pent-up demand since the lockdown plus the temporary cut in stamp duty on properties up to \u00a3500,000 announced by Rishi Sunak as the centrepiece of his summer financial statement in July.\nProspective buyers are also finding little to choose from, with the stock of houses on sale at estate agents down 3% from last year\u2019s levels.\nThe robust property market is in sharp contrast to the state of the UK economy, which contracted far more than that of any other developed country in the second quarter of 2020, according to figures from the OECD. Richard Donnell of Zoopla said: \u201cThe \u2018once in a lifetime\u2019 re-evalution of housing requirements on the back of the lockdown is a counterweight to the impact of the recession on the UK housing market.\u201d\nThe usual August slowdown in the property market almost disappeared this year, with holiday season sales running 78% higher than last year. However, as schools reopen and the furlough scheme and other government support unwinds, the property market could be \u201cchallenged\u201d, said Zoopla.\nMost property forecasters pencilled in price falls for the UK property market during 2020, with Savills saying in June that it expected a 7.5% decline in prices this year followed by a 5% rebound next year.\nBut Halifax reported earlier this month that house prices in Britain leaped to a new high in July, in a \u201csurprising spike\u201d. The bank said a \u201cmini boom\u201d in the market had pushed average property values up by 1.6% \u2013 or \u00a33,770 \u2013 month-on-month in July and meant the annual rate of growth increased to 3.8%.\nZoopla is now forecasting that house prices will end the year 2-3% higher than at the start: \u201cExtensive government support for the economy and labour market, together with support for mortgage holders, has reduced the number of forced sellers and limited the downside for house prices. While the economy has contracted sharply and unemployment is rising, consumer spending has rebounded and various surveys of economic activity are pointing to a wider rebound in the economy.\u201d\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on Wednesday issued fresh guidance to mortgage lenders, telling them to extend forebearance to householders who are coming to the end of their payment holiday but are still in financial distress.\nAround two million people have taken a mortgage holiday since the pandemic began, equal to around one in six of all mortgages in the UK. Applications under the mortgage holiday scheme can be made until 31 October.\nIn its letter to lenders, the FCA said that it expects \u201ccustomers [should] receive appropriate forbearance that is in their interests after consideration of their individual circumstances\u201d, and \u201cfirms [should] support their customers through a period of payment difficulties\u201d.\nCharlotte Nixon, mortgage expert at Quilter Financial Planning, said: \u201cAssuming that the payment holidays are not extended past October, the guidance is clear that the onus is still very much on lenders to help customers get through this difficult period.\u201d",

It comes as the NSPCC and British Athletes Commission revealed that 120 people had come forward in the past month to contact a dedicated helpline for reporting abuse, bullying and mistreatment allegations in gymnastics.\nThe chair of UK Anti-Doping, Trevor Pearce, whose organisation has spearheaded the initiative, told the Guardian it was a vital next step. \u201cIn light of the review into gymnastics and other reviews that have taken place, I think it\u2019s more important than ever that those of us in sport with an interest in integrity issues get round the table, to do what we can to share information and new ideas, to mend any cracks in the system and to improve the situation for athletes,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhile the power of sport to inspire people has not diminished, unfortunately it has become too common to hear stories of scandals, accusations and damning testimonies, where the integrity of sport is called into question.\u201d\nThe announcement comes after Ukad asked Swansea University to identify whether issues of integrity \u2013 such as match-fixing, safeguarding, corruption, misconduct or doping \u2013 are linked and to also investigate the benefits of sports working closely to minimise such threats.\nResearchers, who came up with 24 recommendations for better governance, also found that while some sports bodies were committing to more than \u00a32m a year towards integrity issues, over half the sports surveyed spent less than \u00a310,000.\nThe sports minister, Nigel Huddleston, whose department will host the first meeting next month, welcomed the news, adding the forum would tackle \u201csome of the most complex challenges facing sport today\u201d.\nWhile the forum falls short of creating a sports ombudsman which some believe is needed to oversee British sport, Pearce said he hoped it would lead to an industry-wide strategy that would protect the purity of sport. \u201cWe know that the wrong sort of behaviour can happen in sport and if it happens once in one area, it\u2019s likely that there might be links to another area of concern,\u201d he added.\n\u201cNo single organisation has the powers, capabilities or jurisdiction to meet the demands presented by these ever-changing integrity threats, so it is imperative that organisations collaborate and share knowledge and best practice if we wish to protect purity of sport.\u201d",

It is funded by employers, who pay an annual levy which means the scheme is currently around \u00a36bn in surplus.\nAround 230,000 people currently rely on the PPF for pension payments, including 11,500 former employees of Kodak, which had a \u00a31.5bn shortfall in its pension when it fell into the PPF in 2019. It also looks after 27,000 members of the Carillion pension scheme, with had an \u00a3800m deficit.\nSteve Webb, who was pensions minister in the coalition government between 2010 and 2015 and oversaw the PPF, said that a fresh Covid-19-driven spate of company collapses could result in the scheme using up its surplus and resorting to \u201cextreme measures\u201d.\nIf many more large schemes have to be rescued by the PPF, it will also result in a potentially sharp increase in levies on existing employers, some of them already struggling.\nGloucester MP Richard Graham said a local manufacturing firm, Norville Group, was pushed into administration last month partly because of the levies it had to pay the PPF. \u201cThe PPF levy absorbed all Norville profits of the last few years, weakening their balance sheet and paving the way for a cash flow crisis,\u201d said Graham.\n  Webb, now a consultant for actuaries LCP, modelled two scenarios, one involving a \u00a310bn hit to the PPF from the Covid-19 recession, and one of \u00a320bn. But he added: \u201cIf several larger employers were all to face insolvency in the coming years, even the more serious \u00a320bn hit could prove to be an under-estimate.\u201d\nThe study suggests that the PPF should be able to absorb a \u00a310bn hit from insolvencies, and survive a \u00a320bn hit by raising levies on companies. But above that level of corporate insolvency, it may be forced into the \u201cnuclear\u201d option of cutting payouts to existing pensioners to 90% of their current level, although this would require parliamentary approval.\n\u201cThe PPF has a range of levers it can pull to absorb increased cost pressures without having to resort to cutting benefits to members. But we cannot be complacent. Recent history has been a reminder that the crucial question is whether the insolvencies which we are likely to see in the coming years will hit firms which also have large DB deficits. There remains a risk that too many such insolvencies could put a serious strain on the system,\u201d said Webb.\nDavid Taylor, PPF Executive Director responsible for the PPF levy said: \u201cOur members, levy payers and those protected by the PPF should not be concerned with speculation about our ability to weather the current economic situation. Our latest modelling shows that we are well-placed to achieve our self-sufficiency target, and our 2020-21 levy estimate remains unchanged from its announcement last year.\u201d",

Hundreds of thousands of people were under evacuation order.\nThe governors of Texas and Louisiana continued to urge residents along the affected coastline to leave the area as the National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned of potentially \u201cunsurvivable\u201d storm surges of up to 20ft from Sea Rim state park in Texas to Intracoastal City in Louisiana, a stretch of coastline over 170 miles long.\nA storm surge, frequently the most devastating element of a hurricane, is a rise in water level caused by powerful winds and low pressure.\nThe storm surge in certain areas could penetrate up to 40 miles inland, the NHC said. Tornado and flash flooding warnings were issued for swaths of Louisiana, Arkansas and east Texas.\nThe National Weather Service meteorologist Benjamin Schott told a news conference: \u201cThe word \u2018unsurvivable\u2019 is not one that we like to use, and it\u2019s one that I\u2019ve never used before.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cTo think that there would be a wall of water over two stories high coming on shore is very difficult for most to conceive, but that is what is going to happen.\u201d\n\u201cThe water is already coming up,\u201d said the National Hurricane Center director, Ken Graham. \u201cIf you\u2019re told to leave, you need to do it now because what happens is the water comes in early and you start cutting off your evacuation routes.\u201d\nForecasters were concerned that Laura could make landfall during high tide, making any storm surge even more devastating.\n\u201cThis is a tough storm \u2013 big, powerful and every forecast seems to increase the intensity,\u201d the Louisiana governor, John Bel Edwards, told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cFor the first time in many years we\u2019ve activated the entire Louisiana national guard.\u201d\nGreg Abbott, the governor of Texas, warned that communities now under hurricane watch had only a few hours left to evacuate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for people to know that from about 7pm [on Wednesday] until about 9am [on Thursday] morning, it will be a little bit of a lockdown time period for the ability of rescuers and aiders to get in and provide support for anybody in the local regions,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cWe urge everybody who may be in harm\u2019s way to take these few last hours to get out of harm\u2019s way. It may only be a day or two.\u201d\nAbbott has activated a huge rescue and evacuation operation involving 400 buses, 82 boats and 38 planes.\nHotels and shelters in some affected areas had already reached capacity as the evacuation effort was made more complicated by the coronavirus pandemic, which has ravaged Louisiana and Texas for months.\nIn Lake Charles, south-west Louisiana, national guard troops were picking up residents, many families with small children, in school buses and transporting them to a local coliseum. The National Weather Service evacuated its own office in the city, moving forecasting duties to another station in Brownsville, Texas.\nIn Texas, Nim Kidd, the chief of the Texas division of emergency management, said the city of Austin, which is not in Laura\u2019s pathway but has become a major hub for evacuees, had already run out of free hotel rooms, meaning officials were scrambling to send people further inland.\n The caption of an image in this article was amended on 27 August 2020 to correct a misspelling of Gaido\u2019s Seaside Inn as \u201cGuido\u2019s\u201d.",

In a statement released via the Human Rights Law Centre, they said they were \u201cdevastated and angry\u201d.\n\u201cThe two police officers who failed to properly check on our mum, and instead left her to die on the floor of a police cell, have been let off,\u201d they said.\n\u201cThe DPP seem to have based their conclusion on a police investigation that we have said all along was flawed and lacked independence.\n\u201cIt is not good enough that such an important decision was made behind closed doors without any input from our family or the broader Aboriginal community. It is in the public interest \u2013 and the interests of Aboriginal people across Australia \u2013 that the police be held accountable for their actions.\u201d\nDay died in hospital on 22 December 2017 from a brain haemorrhage sustained when she fell and hit her head in the police cells 17 days earlier, after being arrested for public drunkenness. Police officers told the coroner she had been detained for her own protection, to sober up, but the coroner found that the welfare checks conducted by two police officers responsible for Day\u2019s care in the cells were inadequate and not compliant with police guidelines, and that one of those offices was not a \u201ccredible witness\u201d.\nNo internal sanctions have been issued by Victoria police against any officer involved. The force said it acknowledged the loss and suffering experienced by Day\u2019s family.\n\u201cAfter an assessment of the evidence and receiving advice from the OPP, Victoria Police will not be proceeding with charges against the police officers in this matter,\u201d police said in a statement.\n\u201cVictoria Police takes any death in police care or custody very seriously and will continue reviewing the coroner\u2019s findings and recommendations.\u201d\nThe case prompted the Andrews government to abolish the crime of public drunkenness but the legislation to make that change \u2013 first promised 12 months ago \u2013 has not yet appeared.\nIn making the referral to the DPP four months ago, English said she had been asked by lawyers for Day\u2019s family to consider whether the death could be considered negligent manslaughter. She found that the 55-year-old\u2019s death was \u201cclearly preventable had she not been arrested and taken into custody\u201d.\n\u201cThe totality of the evidence inclines me to assenting to a belief that an indictable offence may have been committed,\u201d she said.\nDay\u2019s family said the investigation into her death should have been independent. Deaths in custody in every Australian jurisdiction are initially investigated by police and then subject to a coronial inquiry, which is often heavily reliant on the police files. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families have for decades argued that this structure is biased towards police.\n\u201cOur mum\u2019s case shows why it\u2019s wrong for police to be investigating the actions of their own colleagues,\u201d Day\u2019s children said. \u201cWhen someone dies at the hands of the police, the law should require a transparent investigation, so that there can be truth and accountability.\u201d\nA Human Rights Law Centre senior lawyer, Monique Hurley, said deaths in custody would continue to occur \u201cfor as long as Premier Andrews allows police to act with impunity\u201d.\n\u201cThe Andrews Government must step up to the plate and address the institutional racism and lack of police accountability that lead to abuse, mistreatment and Aboriginal people dying in custody,\u201d she said.",

        "content": "Infections in Indonesian city plummet after release of mosquitoes injected with Wolbachia bacteria \nInfecting mosquitoes with a naturally occurring bacteria dramatically reduces their ability to transmit dengue, according to a breakthrough study that could pave the way to eliminating the disease.\nResearch conducted in Indonesia, where dengue is endemic, found that releasing mosquitoes infected with the bacteria Wolbachia into parts of Yogyakarta city reduced the number of dengue infections by 77% compared with untreated areas.\n\u201cWe are really hopeful this will lead to local elimination [of dengue] in Yogyakarta city, and the next stage is to scale up beyond Yogyakarta to other parts of Indonesia,\u201d said Dr Katie Anders, director of impact assessment at the World Mosquito Program, and one of the study\u2019s lead researchers.\nThe same method is also being applied in other countries where dengue is prevalent, with the aim of eliminating the disease as a public health concern.\nDuring the study, buckets of mosquito eggs infected with Wolbachia were gradually distributed to homes in the city over a period of around six months. In total, about 6 million mosquitoes were released across an area of 13 square kilometres, where they then infected other wild mosquitoes.\nOther parts of the city did not receive any infected mosquitoes, with health teams instead continuing the usual disease control methods.\nThe infected mosquitoes did not behave differently, nor did their population fall, but their capacity to transmit the virus that causes dengue was vastly reduced.\nIt\u2019s not known why Wolbachia \u2013 which researchers micro-injected into mosquito eggs \u2013 inhibits the transmission of dengue, said Anders. It might be that the bacteria and virus are competing inside the mosquito for resources needed to replicate. \u201cBy having bacteria there it might prevent the virus from growing, and or [the bacteria] might elicit an immune response in the mosquito that\u2019s protective against the virus.\u201d\nThe study supports previous findings from non-randomised studies in Yogyakarta and northern Queensland. It is an important milestone, said Anders, because it provides \u201cdefinitive evidence from a gold standard trial that where we have Wolbachia established, we are seeing dramatically less dengue\u201d.\nThe findings provide fresh hope in the battle against dengue, which has grown in prevalence over recent decades, spreading to previously unaffected countries, and causing larger outbreaks in areas where it is already endemic. The World Health Organization recorded 4.2 million cases in 2019. There is no specific treatment for dengue.\nWhile the rise in case numbers is partly due to better reporting practices, some have warned global heating is fuelling its spread.\n\u201cIt is also to do with urbanisation and high-density population because this mosquito [Aedes aegypti, the main vector for dengue] likes to live in urban environments close to people,\u201d said Anders.\nThe movement of people between countries has also allowed the introduction of each of the four dengue virus strains into new areas, she added.\nIndonesia has 7 million dengue cases a year, said Professor Adi Utarini from Universitas Gadjah Mada, which partnered with the World Mosquito Program. The study, she said, showed \u201cthe significant impact the Wolbachia method can have in reducing dengue in urban populations\u201d.\nThe same method was previously applied in parts of northern Queensland, where dengue has now been eliminated as a public health concern, with no outbreaks recorded for the past five years.\nNicholas Jewell, professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and the trial\u2019s independent statistician, described the results as compelling. \u201cDoubly exciting is that the trial design used here provides a template that other candidate health interventions can follow,\u201d he said.\nIt is believed the presence of the Wolbachia bacteria also prevents the spread of other viruses such as chikungunya and zika \u2013 though such diseases were not prevalent enough in Yogyakarta for researchers to test this in the study.\nDetailed results of the trial, which was completed across an area with a population of 312,000, will be presented at an international scientific congress in November.",

The shooting occurred in Kenosha, Wisconsin, which is 40 miles from Milwaukee.\nThe Bucks had been due to come on court for 4pm ET on Wednesday afternoon, but did not emerge from the locker room. They released a statement on Wednesday afternoon calling for action and justice for Jacob Blake.\n\u201cWhen we take the court and represent Milwaukee and Wisconsin, we are expected to play at a high level, give maximum effort and hold each other accountable,\u201d they said. \u201cIn this moment, we are demanding the same from our lawmakers and law enforcement.\u201d\nThe Bucks demanded the Wisconsin state legislature reconvene after months of inaction to \u201ctake up meaningful measures\u201d on police brutality and criminal justice reform.\n\u201cWe encourage all citizens to educate themselves, take peaceful and responsible action, and remember to vote on Nov. 3,\u201d they concluded.\nTwo NBA playoff games \u2013 between the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Houston Rockets; and the Portland Trail Blazers and the Los Angeles Lakers \u2013 were also postponed on Wednesday.\nThe Seattle Mariners and San Diego Padres baseball game as well as a San Francisco Giants-Los Angeles Dodgers game were also canceled Wednesday night.\nThis video has been removed. This could be because it launched early, our rights have expired, there was a legal issue, or for another reason.\nGabe Kapler, manager of the San Francisco Giants, put out a strong statement in support of the team\u2019s strike.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it should require athletes needing to boycott playoffs games to remind us that Black Lives Matter, and that police brutality is unacceptable, and that systemic racism to be eliminated,\u201d he said.\nThe WNBA also postponed its three games on Wednesday, just hours after the NBA.\n\u201cWe know it\u2019s a very emotional time for our players. They are struggling with what\u2019s been happening in this country for months, if not years,\u201d said Cathy Engelbert, WNBA commissioner, who added that the league supports its players\u2019 decision to not play on Wednesday night.\nThere has been growing anger about racial injustice among NBA players, 80% of whom are black, as the season has progressed. On Monday, Hill said the season should not have resumed in the first place.\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have even came to this damn place [Orlando, where the playoffs are taking place], to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cI think coming here just took all the focal points off what the issues are. But we\u2019re here, so it is what it is. We can\u2019t do anything from right here, but I think definitely, when it\u2019s all settled, some things have to be done.\n\u201cI think this world has to change. I think our police department has to change. Us as society has to change. And, right now we\u2019re not seeing any of that. Lives are being taken, as we speak, day in and day out, and there\u2019s no consequence or accountability for it, and that\u2019s what has to change.\u201d\nSome things are bigger than basketball. The stand taken today by the players and org shows that we\u2019re fed up. Enough is enough. Change needs to happen. I\u2019m incredibly proud of our guys and we stand 100% behind our players ready to assist and bring about real change\nShortly after the postponements were confirmed, the NBA\u2019s biggest star, LeBron James, tweeted: \u201cFUCK THIS MAN!!!! WE DEMAND CHANGE. SICK OF IT.\u201d\nThe Bucks senior vice-president, Alex Lasry, said the team supported their players\u2019 stance. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly proud of our guys and we stand 100% behind our players ready to assist and bring about real change,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\nMembers of the Bucks have spoken about problems of racism and police brutality in the Milwaukee area before. Peter Feigin, the Bucks\u2019 president, offended some fans in 2016 when he said Milwaukee was \u201cthe most segregated and racist place\u201d he had known. Meanwhile, in an interview with the Guardian last year, the former Bucks player Malcolm Brogdon spoke about similar problems.\n\u201cBefore I came to Milwaukee I\u2019d heard the city was the most segregated in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d heard it was racist. When I got here it was extremely segregated. I\u2019ve never lived in a city this segregated. Milwaukee\u2019s very behind in terms of being progressive. There are things that need to change rapidly.\u201d\nThere have been protests in Kenosha since the shooting, and police arrested Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, after two people were shot dead at a demonstration in the town on Tuesday night.\nWednesday\u2019s boycott recalls a similarly troubled time in US history following the brutal beating of Rodney King, a black man, by white police officers in 1991. The Chicago Bulls player Craig Hodges wanted his team, along with their opponents the Lakers, to boycott the opening game of the NBA finals so that: \u201cwe would stand in solidarity with the black community while calling out racism and economic inequality in the NBA, where there were no black owners and almost no black coaches despite the fact that 75% of the players in the league were African American\u201d.\nThe Bulls legend Michael Jordan told Hodges he was \u201ccrazy\u201d while the Lakers star Magic Johnson said: \u201cThat\u2019s too extreme, man.\u201d\nIn 2017, Hodges told the Guardian he regretted his failure to persuade the teams to boycott.\n\u201cOur generation dropped the ball as a lot of us were more concerned with our own economic gain,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were at that point where branding was just beginning and we got caught up in individual branding rather than a unified movement.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, Magic players were practicing on court before what they thought would be the start of the game but left shortly after they learned the Bucks would not join them.\nThe Bucks lead the best-of-seven series 3-1 and are one of the favorites to win the title. Their star player and reigning league MVP, Giannis Antetokounmpo, was named NBA defensive player of the year on Tuesday.\nThis season\u2019s playoffs are taking place in an isolated bubble at Florida\u2019s Walt Disney World due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nAgencies contributed reporting",

People in charge from the governor of Wisconsin on down refused to enforce the law. They stood back and they watched Kenosha burn,\u201d Carlson said.\nHe then added: \u201cSo are we really surprised that looting and arson accelerated to murder? How shocked are we that 17-year-olds with rifles decided they had to maintain order when no one else would?\u201d\nHis words were met with instant condemnation on social media.\n\u201cAn innocent black guy is killed by police and Tucker Carlson calls him a thug. A guilty white guy murders two people and Tucker Carlson calls him a patriot,\u201d tweeted CNN commentator Keith Boykins.\n\u201cHe just justified murder,\u201d tweeted the New York Times journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones.\nAn innocent black guy is killed by police and Tucker Carlson calls him a thug.A guilty white guy murders two people and Tucker Carlson calls him a patriot. https://t.co/SGHhohdLfC\nHe just justified murder. https://t.co/JLcWzB6s2H\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t take action after this, every one of Fox News\u2019s executives, directors and advertisers is complicit in Tucker Carlson\u2019s racist, murderous rants,\u201d said Robert Reich, a former secretary of labor under Bill Clinton.\nThe comments are far from the only time Carlson has broadcast bigoted or extreme views, especially when it comes to race and immigration.\nLast August, Carlson announced a vacation after causing a rift with advertisers by calling white supremacy a \u201choax\u201d and a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d. In another incident Carlson said that letting low-income people immigrate to America \u201cmakes our own country poor and dirtier\u201d.\nRecently, one of Carlson\u2019s top writers resigned after a CNN investigation found he was posting racist and sexist comments online under a pseudonym. Blake Neff regularly posted offensive language on an online forum called AutoAdmit.\nIn June, for example, Neff wrote, \u201cBlack doods staying inside playing Call of Duty is probably one of the biggest factors keeping crime down.\u201d Neff also harassed a woman on the forum.",

He referred to talent show, The Voice, as an example of a high-cost show, but Nine had made no decisions about its future TV programming.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see some of those high-cost shows be replaced by some other initiatives that \u2026 will come in at lower cost,\u201d he said.\nNine has already ripped $225m in costs out of the business, including by renegotiating its contract to broadcast rugby league.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see continued pressure on sports costs as we go forward,\u201d Marks said.\nAs the advertising market cratered due to the coronavirus crisis, revenue slumped at the TV division and at the group\u2019s metropolitan newspapers, which include the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age.\nMarks said he hoped the metro division would get money from the digital platforms, Google and Facebook, as a result of a proposed new code that will force the tech giants to share revenue with media companies.\nRevenue at Nine\u2019s streaming service, Stan, rose by more than 50% and online newspaper subscription payments also rose, by about 9%.\nOverall, revenue at the company rose from $1.97bn to almost $2.2bn.\nThis came despite a steep fall in revenue at the company\u2019s traditional core business, free-to-air TV, which slumped from a little over $1bn to $952bn.\nNine last year said Stan, which had bled cash since it was set up as a joint venture with Fairfax in 2015, had turned towards profit.\nBut this year it revealed Stan\u2019s contribution to company earnings \u2013 a modest positive result of $17.9m, compared with a loss of $11.5m in the previous year.\nStan\u2019s revenue soared from $157m to $242m.\nMeanwhile, radio revenue plunged by more than 20%, from $132m to $103m.\nRevenue at real estate listings group Domain, which is 60% owned by Nine, fell 20% to $267m.",

It is the first time under current New Zealand law that a sentence of life without the possibility of parole has been imposed.\nDozens more were wounded in the attacks in March last year in the country\u2019s worst peacetime massacre. It prompted an outpouring of grief and unity in New Zealand and around the world, and generated debate about how to deal with white supremacist terrorism.\nEarlier, the gunman, Australian Brenton Tarrant, 29, did not oppose the sentence in court on Thursday \u2013 despite being given the chance to do so \u2013 provoking surprise among some of his victims.\n\u201cYou present as a deeply impaired person motivated by a base hatred of people you perceive to be different from yourself,\u201d Justice Cameron Mander, the presiding judge, told the court in Christchurch, as he pronounced the sentence.\n\u201cYou have offered no apology or public acknowledgement of the harms you have caused,\u201d he added. \u201cWhile I appreciate that you have forsaken the opportunity to use these proceedings as a platform, you appear neither contrite nor ashamed.\u201d\n\u201cYou committed mass murder,\u201d said Justice Mander. \u201cYou slaughtered unarmed and defenceless people.\u201d\nThe attacks had been extensively planned over a long period of time, he said. An earlier official account given in court revealed the gunman had amassed a cache of semiautomatic weapons and studied plans of the mosques he intended to attack.\n\u201cThe sole purpose of this preparation was to kill as many people at each mosque as efficiently and as systematically as you could,\u201d he added.\nBefore he imposed the jail term, Mander read aloud, at length, moving descriptions of most of Tarrant\u2019s victims and recounted remarks their families had told him. Twice, the judge paused briefly to blow his nose and compose himself.\n\u201cTheir loss is unbearable,\u201d he said, of one family. In remarks about another victim, he said: \u201cYour actions have destroyed that family as they have so many other families.\u201d Some in the public gallery wept as the judge mentioned their murdered relatives.\nOf Mucaad Ibrahim, 3, who was deliberately executed by the gunman, Mander said: \u201cNo parents can recover from the murder of such a small child.\u201d\nThe sentence came after the court heard three days of emotional victim impact statements during which more than 90 of those bereaved or wounded in the attacks addressed the court. Many asked Mander to bar the gunman from ever walking free from jail.\nThe Australian man broadcast part of the massacre live on Facebook and published an extremist manifesto online detailing his anti-Islamic views. In March this year, he had abruptly pleaded guilty to the charges he faced \u2013 51 counts of murder, one of attempted murder, and a terrorism charge \u2013 and there were fears he would use the hearing to decide his sentence as a platform for his extremist ideology.\nBefore the sentence was pronounced, the prosecutor and the terrorist \u2013 who had represented himself at the hearings after firing his lawyers in July \u2013 gave their views on what the sentence should be.\nMark Zarifeh, the lead prosecutor in the case, said that no minimum term of imprisonment was enough for the gunman, \u201cgiven the gravity of the offending and the devastating loss of life and injury\u201d.\n\u201cThe enormity of the offending in this case is without comparison in New Zealand\u2019s criminal history,\u201d he said, adding that there could be \u201cno doubt\u201d that the gunman was \u201cclearly New Zealand\u2019s worst murderer\u201d.\nTarrant\u2019s murders had been extensively planned, the prosecutor said. Zarifeh urged the judge to consider the vulnerability of the victims and the gunman\u2019s \u201ccalculated and militaristic determination\u201d in carrying out his plan.\nMany of those shot \u201cwere on their knees at prayer with their backs to the offender,\u201d he added. \u201cThey were clearly vulnerable to the spontaneous infliction of violence.\u201d\nZarifeh added that the term was necessary to deter others. Many of the 220 victim impact statements provided to the court \u2013 dozens of which were read aloud to the judge this week \u2013 reflected the \u201creal fear\u201d of similar attacks in future.\nThe prosecutor also spoke about what is known of Tarrant\u2019s mental state and motivations, referring to the psychological reports that were commissioned last year to ensure the gunman was fit to plead to the charges. Those reports noted that the gunman showed no remorse, no concern for those affected, and spoke in a matter-of-fact manner about his crimes, the prosecutor said.\nThe gunman listened intently to the prosecutor without displaying a response. He has occasionally, on previous days, acknowledged his victims.\nA stand-by lawyer had been provided to the court should Tarrant want to use them, and on Thursday he did. In a single sentence, Philip Hall, the lawyer, said he had received one instruction from the gunman: that he did \u201cnot oppose the application that he should be sentenced to the term of life without parole\u201d. Hall took his seat.\n\u201cWow,\u201d said one of the gunman\u2019s victims in the public gallery.\nMander addressed the gunman directly. Did Tarrant wish to say anything?\n\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d he said.\nThroughout the morning, dozens of members of the public began to gather at the blockade in front of the courthouse. Many held signs depicting large, red hearts, or reading: \u201cWe are one.\u201d",

The strikes have now spread across the US sports world and include teams from the NBA, WNBA, MLB and MLS.\n\u201cHello, as many of you are aware I was scheduled to play my semi-finals match tomorrow,\u201d Osaka wrote in a statement on her social media accounts. \u201cHowever, before I am an athlete, I am a black woman. And as a black woman I feel as though there are much more important matters at hand that need immediate attention, rather than watching me play tennis.\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect anything drastic to happen with me not playing, but if I can get a conversation started in a majority white sport I consider that a step in the right direction. Watching the continued genocide of Black people at the hand of the police is honestly making me sick to my stomach. I\u2019m exhausted of having a new hashtag pop up every few days and I\u2019m extremely tired of having this same conversation over and over again. When will it ever be enough?\u201d\nOsaka, who was one of the first athletes to travel to Minnesota in the summer to protest for and pay tribute to George Floyd, punctuated her message by hashtagging the names of Black people who had been shot or killed by the police: Blake, Breonna Taylor, Elijah McClain and Floyd.\nEarlier on Wednesday, Osaka faced a 4-6, 0-2 and 30-40 deficit against Kontaveit before crushing an 114mph ace to save the break point and then reeling off nine games in a row. She eventually eked out a tight final set to secure her third win of the week. She was scheduled to face Elise Mertens of Belgium in the semi-final, who will now receive a walkover into the final. The US Open begins on 31 August.The former No 1 Victoria Azarenka later beat the in-form Ons Jabeur to reach her first significant semi-final since March 2018. Azarenka is currently ranked 59th and she has struggled since she returned to the tour in 2017 after giving birth to a son, in part due to an enduring custody battle that contributed to her missing the Australian Open this year.\nAzarenka is set to play Johanna Konta in the semi-finals after she defeated Maria Sakkari 6-4, 6-3. The British No 1 eased past her Greek opponent who had eliminated Serena Williams in the previous round. Their semi-final is now set to take place on Friday, after the entire day\u2019s play in New York was suspended in protest at racial injustice.\nIn the men\u2019s draw, Novak Djokovic continued his peerless start to the season as he secured his 21st consecutive win by dismantling Jan Lennard Struff of Germany 6-1, 6-3 in only 62 minutes. Djokovic will face Roberto Bautista Agut in the semi-final.\nAlthough female players had the option of easing back into competition earlier this month, the men have all restarted their seasons in New York and it is yet unclear who is prepared to challenge Djokovic.\nThe defending champion, Daniil Medvedev, appeared to be a worthy challenger for one set, but he was eventually smothered 1-6, 6-4, 6-3 by Bautista Agut.\nElsewhere, the 2009 US Open Champion Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro announced that he has undergone a third surgery on his right knee as his career continues to hang in the balance after fracturing it at the Shanghai Masters in October 2018. It marks the 31-year-old\u2019s seventh career surgery across a desperately unfortunate career.\n This article was amended on 27 August 2020.

        "content": "When a club like Richmond cannot find the finances to field a VFLW team, a concerning precedent is set\nEarlier this week, the AFL announced a dramatic reshaping of its second-tier men\u2019s competition. The NEAFL will align with Victoria\u2019s state league in season 2021. There has been plenty of buzz around this development, with reports suggesting the AFL has committed to paying associated travel costs for teams in what will be the nation\u2019s premier reserve grade competition.\nMeanwhile, female players are still in the dark regarding the future of Victoria\u2019s premier women\u2019s competition. With the announcement of the combined VFL and NEAFL league, female players were expecting a decision on next season\u2019s VFLW competition \u2013 but were instead met with the statement \u201cthere is still no decision on how second-tier women\u2019s football will look in the future\u201d.\nFrom the perspective of a female player, this follows the usual narrative that the future of the men\u2019s game is the AFL\u2019s priority, with decisions on women\u2019s football an afterthought.\nFrom a business stand-point, the men\u2019s game currently creates a significant amount of revenue for the code. But with growth in female participation surging rapidly \u2013 women and girls now make up a third of all Australian rules football participants \u2013 it is easy to see how this audience can lead to greater revenue in the future, if indeed it has not already. The AFLW\u2019s very existence has allowed the sport to venture into new territory and speaks to the hopes and dreams of a new, highly-engaged audience. In the near future sponsorship is expected to be thrown behind women\u2019s teams \u2013 and in doing so a new generation of sports fans will be targeted.\nIt is unfortunate that cost cutting is always at the expense of the women\u2019s game, especially when women and girls are so crucial to the AFL\u2019s growth and participation strategy.\nOn Monday, the Richmond Football Club announced it will not enter the VFLW competition next season due to financial strains. Every AFL club has taken a financial hit due to Covid-19 and budget cuts have been widespread. Richmond is a powerhouse in Australian sport; the Tigers have been AFL premiership winners in two of the past three seasons and recently boasted over 100,000 members for the third consecutive year. But when a club like Richmond cannot find the finances to field a VFLW team, what precedent does this set for the future of the women\u2019s competition?\nIn 2018, the VFLW looked to align the pathway between Victoria\u2019s second-tier competition and the AFLW, with clubs buying licences to field a team in the state league.\nPreviously, community clubs such as the Eastern Devils and St Kilda Sharks formed the VFLW competition, but in the end could not financially compete with AFL clubs and were forced out. Darebin Football Club, backed by Darebin City Council, and Williamstown were the only stand-alone teams that survived the revamp. These community clubs relied on volunteers who lived and breathed footy to ensure the club functioned. Aligning the VFLW with AFLW teams improved the professionalism of the competition and provided a clearer pathway for Victorian talent to land themselves on an AFLW list.\nBut with news of Richmond\u2019s exit from the VFLW, and potentially more clubs to follow, the VFLW may be forced to bring back community clubs to survive \u2013 the very clubs that were financially forced out of the competition a couple of seasons ago. The irony is significant.\nFor the VFLW\u2019s sake, the hope is that these community clubs, who were left somewhat soured by the competition\u2019s restructure in 2018, will come to the rescue of the league if it comes knocking this time around.\nRebecca Beeson is a writer and AFLW footballer for the GWS Giants",

More than half the active cases in Victoria are linked to aged care and healthcare. The government is now starting to provide data on workplaces failing to provide sanitary and safe conditions for workers, having earlier focused on penalising the behaviour of individuals.\n\u201cSince the pandemic started, there\u2019s been 5,259 visits made by WorkSafe inspectors and there\u2019s been 203 notices that have been issued to employers for breaches large and small of Covid-safe work plans,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cFrom the end of July, so when this most recent stage four rules [were introduced] along with a really intense focus on trying to deal with workplace outbreaks, some 916 visits and 78 notices have been issued.\u201d Andrews said he did not have information about the nature of the workplace breaches or whether issues identified had been rectified.\nVictoria reported 113 new cases of the virus overnight and 23 additional deaths, all in people aged between 60 and 90. Of those, 22 were linked to aged care, but Andrews said the sector had stabilised after being ravaged by the virus in the second wave, partly thanks to more than 3,000 shifts worked by hospital staff in aged care homes.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve gone into aged care homes, they have provided the very best of care, and helped to stabilise those environments \u2026 we are very proud of them and grateful to them. In general terms, though, we\u2019ve seen some stability come to aged care settings. That is a good thing. But it\u2019s by no means over.\u201d\nThe nursing and midwifery union has expressed concern that nurses going into aged care settings were becoming infected with the virus. As of Thursday 391 health care workers had active cases of the virus. More than 2,800 health workers have been infected in Victoria since the pandemic hit Australia.\nThe acting chief health officer, Prof Allen Cheng, said there had been cases where patients in hospital had contracted the virus from health workers, but he did not have the data at hand to say how many. Asked whether the persistence of cases in health and aged care was holding the state back, Cheng said: \u201cI think anywhere where there are outbreaks does concern us.\u201d\nOn Thursday the federal aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, was ordered by the Senate to explain his handling of aged care. \u201cWe have been there every step of the way,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery day. We have not stopped, planning, adapting and implementing.\u201d\nCheng said it was reassuring that case numbers were coming down in regional areas. There are now 71 active cases in the greater Geelong area, 16 in greater Bendigo and six in Ballarat.\n\u201cIn regional Victoria, where the numbers are relatively low, we can start to track links between cases,\u201d Cheng said. \u201cSo, we know where most of those cases have come from. That\u2019s reassuring, and that\u2019s what we hope to see in metropolitan Melbourne as well.\u201d\nAndrews said the government was still working through what restrictions might be eased, with stage four lockdown due to end in metropolitan Melbourne and stage three in the rest of Victoria on 13 September. Asked why the government was asking for extended emergency powers, without providing detail about what restrictions might be removed and when, Andrews said he was not prepared to say when he might give more detail.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll work as hard as we possibly can to provide people with as much notice as possible [about easing restrictions],\u201d he said.\nMeanwhile in New South Wales, nine new cases of the virus were reported overnight. All were locally acquired and linked to known cases, including five linked to the Sydney CBD cluster, and four people who are close contacts of previous cases.\nThree of the new cases attended City Tattersalls Club gym, and anyone who attended the gym between 8am to 2pm on 19, 21 or 23 August is a close contact and must get tested. Other members of City Tattersalls are being urged to get tested if they have even mild symptoms.\nNSW Health is also contacting people who were at the Hunters Hill bowling club indoor dining room on 23 August from noon to 2pm as they may be close contacts of a case and must immediately get tested and self-isolate for 14 days. People who attended other areas of the club must monitor for symptoms and get tested if they develop.\nNSW Health is currently treating 74 Covid-19 cases, including six patients in intensive care and four on ventilation.",

She added: \u201cWe can only heal from here.\u201d\nLatef Alabi, who was leading prayers at Linwood mosque when the attack happened, said the terrorist had failed to divide New Zealand and he had made \u201cthe best decision of his life\u201d by moving to the country, where \u201cjustice had been served\u201d.\n\u201cWherever you come from, you were born the same, the same way we were born.

Today I thank everyone around the world to please, always choose the best, to be kind, to be clean from inside, and you will remain the best until you die.\u201d\nPolice Commissioner Andrew Coster said that while the sentencing was an important milestone in the judicial process, it should not overshadow the incredible determination and survival of victims.\n\u201cNew Zealand and the world have felt the pain of the Muslim community and the horror of such a hateful and senseless act committed in our own backyard, against our own people,\u201d Coster said.\n\u201cWe responded to this event with unity and our communities came closer together, which is ultimately what will ensure that all people can be safe and feel safe in this country.\u201d\nAustralian prime minister Scott Morrison said he had called Ardern to convey his relief over Tarrant\u2019s sentence.\n\u201cJustice today was delivered to the terrorist and murderer for his cowardly and horrific crimes in Christchurch.

It was responding to a complaint raised by a member of the public in April.\nThe report shows that Public Health England published two contradictory documents that month. One advised care workers making home visits to wear PPE and the other did not mention the need. The contradiction was not cleared up for six weeks.\nThe government\u2019s guidance had been a shambles that had placed workers and their vulnerable clients at risk, the policy director at the United Kingdom Homecare Association, Colin Angel, said on Wednesday. The association also accused the government of sidelining its expertise and publishing new guidance with little notice, sometimes late on Friday nights, meaning that it was not always noticed by the people it was intended for.\nThe HSIB report said the care worker in question \u201cdid not use PPE and had been told this was not necessary \u2026 The patient later died, and their death was confirmed as being Covid-19 related \u2026 The care visits occurred when the patient and other household member were not showing any Covid-19 symptoms.\u201d\nAbout 819 people receiving home care have died of Covid-19 in England and Wales, according to official statistics.\n\u201cWe were very sorry to hear of what happened and lessons have been learnt,\u201d said Dr \u00c9amonn O\u2019Moore, PHE\u2019s head of adult social care. \u201cWe updated the links to the guidance clarifying the right one to use. We continue to update and revise UK guidance informed by the evolving evidence, as well as listening to feedback from the health and care sectors on its appropriateness and accessibility.\u201d\nAngel said: \u201cIt has been consistently confusing for people who had to put it into practice \u2026 It has relied heavily on cross-referencing between different online documents, they were using unfamiliar and ambiguous expressions and the information we needed was dotted across the gov.uk website.\n\u201cBecause the guidance wasn\u2019t clear, in the early stages, local councils, community health services and providers were having to interpret what they thought were the right answers. We have been worried throughout coronavirus that both people receiving care and the workforce would not be adequately protected by the correct use of PPE.\u201d\nPHE and other public bodies issued general guidance on 2 April that included PPE provisions for home care workers working with people in the \u201cclinically extremely vulnerable\u201d group, but separate primary guidance for home care provision issued four days later did not include this information.\nPHE then issued guidance on 27 April on how to work safely in domiciliary care in England which did include PPE provisions needed for people in the \u201cclinically extremely vulnerable\u201d group.\nThe primary guidance, however, was not updated and remained live on the gov.uk website until 13 May. In between, the investigators looking into the Covid-19 death of the home care client alerted PHE to the safety risk.",

        "content": "Thousands of young women leave home in Nigeria every year on the promise of a good job in Europe, only to be trapped by debt and forced into prostitution. But one joined forces with investigators in Italy to expose the traffickers. By Ottavia Spaggiari\nSusan had been on Italian soil for exactly three days when, on 23 July 2015, she was taken with dozens of other new arrivals to a noisy, overcrowded detention centre in Rome, and told she would shortly be deported back to Nigeria. Some women shouted in anger, others started to cry. Susan remained silent. She could not go back.\nThe previous spring, Susan had been persuaded to make the journey to Italy by a Nigerian woman called Ivie, who she met in her home village in the southern Nigerian state of Edo. The woman had offered to pay for Susan\u2019s journey to Europe and promised she would get decent, paid work when she arrived. Susan underwent a traditional juju oath-taking ceremony, in front of a priest, in which she swore to pay the woman back and to be loyal to her. Now, here in Italy, Susan knew that if she did not repay the debt, there would be terrible consequences.\nA lawyer from a voluntary organisation helped Susan make an asylum application that would allow her to remain in the country, and after a few more weeks in detention she was transferred to a migrant reception centre in central Italy to wait for her case to be processed. Soon after, Ivie picked her up and brought her to an apartment in Prato, outside Florence. Four other young Nigerian women were already living there. One of them handed Susan a pair of high-heeled shoes and a short skirt. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to work.\u201d\nSusan thought it must be a joke. She had been promised work as a babysitter or a supermarket cashier. \u201cThey didn\u2019t tell me I would come here to be a prostitute,\u201d Susan told me. But the women around her were not laughing. When she protested, Ivie reminded her that she had paid for her journey, and of how much money she owed. If she didn\u2019t pay, or if she spoke about it to anyone, her mother and brothers back home would be in danger. \u201cI was crying,\u201d Susan told me. \u201cThe other girls said: \u2018You\u2019ll get used to it\u2019. I said: \u2018I\u2019ll never get used to it.\u2019\u201d\nThere were no days off. Susan was never alone, but she felt isolated. Ivie had created a hierarchy, making it hard for the girls to bond. Hillary, another young woman from Edo state, had been given the role of collecting the money at the end of the night and checking on the girls. Susan\u2019s survival strategy was to avoid the men who came looking for sex \u2013 to work as little as possible. In January she made only \u20ac420. Frustrated by Susan\u2019s poor earnings, Ivie hit her so hard that Susan was afraid she was going to lose the sight in one eye.\nOne day at the end of January, five weeks after Susan had arrived in Prato, Susan was moved to another town in the north of Italy. Ivie controlled her from afar, calling her often, and her new madam pressured her for money. \u201cI couldn\u2019t continue like that. Every night in the rain, every day,\u201d Susan said. The hardest thing to bear was that her sacrifice was not even helping her family in Nigeria. \u201cThey didn\u2019t let me send any money home.\u201d\nSince 2015, about 21,000 Nigerian women and girls have arrived on Italian shores. In 2017, the UN\u2019s International Organization for Migration reported that 80% were potential victims of sex trafficking, but numbers are hard to confirm. Italy has been the stage for a cruel cycle of exploitation in which survivors of trafficking, after years of forced prostitution, have become traffickers themselves, the so-called \u201cmadams\u201d. Some of them bring new women to Italy in order to finish paying off their debt to their traffickers and find a way out of the streets, and others have been exploited for so long that they see exploitation of others as their only option for a better life.\nVictims are generally afraid to come forward, and few traffickers have been identified. The UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, a key tool in international law to prosecute traffickers and protect survivors, states that survivors of trafficking should be offered temporary or permanent residence. Italy was a major proponent of the convention, which was signed in Palermo in December 2000. But since then, as more migrants have arrived, the political landscape has changed.\nAfter 2009, when Italian law made it a criminal offence to enter and stay in the country without a visa, the fear of being arrested forced undocumented migrants to go underground. Victims of trafficking are rarely identified during immigration controls. Even if they are identified as possible victims, under questioning, many women struggle to recall details of their journey. \u201cThey don\u2019t remember the name of the city they were transferred to, so they are not considered believable,\u201d Carla Quinto, a lawyer working with the anti-trafficking organisation Be Free, told me.\nIf they are believed, gathering evidence for the three elements constituting the crime of human trafficking \u2013 recruitment, transfer and exploitation \u2013 presents further challenges: the difficulty of co-ordinating international investigations with police from the countries of origin, the lack of sympathy or support from many police officers and prosecutors in Italy, and the fact that Nigerian criminal groups behind human trafficking sometimes collaborate with the local mafia for protection. Investigations are complex and often slow, while traffickers move quickly, relocate their victims frequently and change their phone numbers multiple times. \u201cCriminal organisations are always ahead of us,\u201d Quinto said.\nBut in February 2016, a magistrate specialising in organised crime, Angela Pietroiusti, launched an investigation that would cut through layers of prejudice and bring the expertise of anti-mafia units to bear on sex trafficking. Over the course of a year, the investigation uncovered a sophisticated network of traffickers operating between Nigeria, Libya, Italy, France, Germany and the UK, which recruited young women and girls, and brought them to Europe.\nKey to this investigation were the detailed notes and photographs that one woman, outraged at being forced into prostitution, had amassed in secret. That woman was Susan.\nFrancesca De Masi has been visiting the Ponte Galeria women\u2019s detention centre in south-west Rome every week since 2008. Her task is to identify human trafficking victims among the detainees, offer them counselling and legal help, and get them moved to a shelter. On Wednesdays, De Masi and her team Be Free usually set up in Ponte Galeria\u2019s library, a dark room with few books and many mosquitos. Sometimes she and her colleagues approach the detainees in the corridors; sometimes it\u2019s the women who enter the library and strike up a conversation. The first few minutes of the exchange are crucial. Female traffickers could be in detention together with their victims. \u201cWe can\u2019t say openly that we are an anti-trafficking organisation,\u201d De Masi explained.\nOnce every two weeks, Quinto, Be Free\u2019s in-house criminal lawyer, joins the team in Ponte Galeria to help women who want to press charges against their traffickers. Quinto and De Masi share a passion for cigarettes, and the affectionate, brutal intimacy of siblings. Quinto speaks as if she is always in a hurry. \u201cSometimes I kick her under the desk,\u201d De Masi laughed \u2013 the kick is her sign to Quinto to slow down. \u201cSome of the women need time to open up.\u201d\nWhen she heard the news, in July 2015, that 66 young women from Nigeria, who had just arrived by boat in southern Italy, had been flown to Rome and taken to Ponte Galeria, De Masi had grabbed her car keys and rushed out the door. That day was like nothing she had ever experienced. The women were terrified. Susan was among them, exhausted but determined to avoid deportation. The room where the women were held was overcrowded and hot. To make themselves heard above the panicked and bewildered voices, De Masi and other aid workers climbed on to a table and shouted. They explained that they would need to speak to each of the women individually.\nWhen Susan\u2019s turn came, De Masi approached her and asked: \u201cWho brought you here?\u201d\n\u201cNobody,\u201d Susan replied firmly. She had sworn her loyalty to Ivie, the woman she met in Edo state. She did not yet know what Ivie had in store for her. Susan\u2019s main concern was to stay in Italy and protect her patron at all costs.\nAfter a few failed attempts to gather more of Susan\u2019s story, De Masi, together with the immigration lawyer, helped her file an asylum application. This would protect her from deportation, but because she would not admit that she was recruited in Nigeria, Susan had to remain in the detention centre until the interview with the asylum commission, which was scheduled a month later. Then she would be transferred to a migrant reception centre.\nDe Masi feared that if Susan was transferred to the reception centre, she would be picked up by her trafficker. Reception centres for adult migrants have become connection hubs between traffickers and their victims. In some cases, suspected traffickers walk right into migration centres to pick up their targets.\nDe Masi\u2019s fears proved correct. Once she got to the reception centre, Susan managed to get hold of a phone and re-established contact with Ivie. After two months, Ivie came in a car to collect her. And with that, Susan disappeared.\nIn Prato, Susan found herself living a nightmare. Enraged by her meagre earnings, Ivie would yell at her: \u201cYou\u2019re not a serious girl.\u201d She was forced to work the streets every night, from 5pm until 3am, standing in the cold and rain. There were no days off. If she had a fever, or had her period, she had to work.\nFurious about the lies she had been told, Susan decided to document her new life in Italy. She began taking pictures on her phone of the apartment where she was kept, and even snapped surreptitious photos of Ivie. She kept records of phone numbers and notes of what happened to her. At the time, she wasn\u2019t sure she would be able to do anything with them, but she wanted evidence of what she was being forced to endure. Ivie had given her a notebook in which Susan was supposed to write down the amount of money she gave Ivie each week, and how much she still owed. The notebook was a record of Susan\u2019s debt bondage \u2013 a reminder that if she met more clients and made more money, she could supposedly earn her freedom more rapidly. Susan, however, used the notebook to record her experience. Every transaction she wrote down was evidence of what she was forced to endure.\nAfter Susan was transferred to the new city in northern Italy in January 2016, she kept recording as many details as she could. At first, her life was controlled by a new woman who kept close watch over her. But about a week after her arrival, the new madam went on a trip to Nigeria, leaving Susan with another woman whose control wasn\u2019t as tight. \u201cThat\u2019s when I decided to leave,\u201d Susan said.\nOne morning in early February, she packed her phone and notebook in a small purse and left the house, saying she had to meet a client in a nearby town. Instead, she walked to the train station, intending to travel to Rome. She had managed to keep the contact details of the immigration lawyer she had seen at the Ponte Galeria detention centre in July 2015. Susan tried to keep a low profile at the train station, terrified that someone might recognise her, but she had no cash, and had to stop strangers to beg for money to buy a ticket.\nWhen she finally made it on the train, her phone began to ring. Both Ivie and the new madam were calling her. Susan knew that if she kept ignoring their calls, they would realise something was wrong. She was especially afraid that there would be retaliation against her mother. She had to come up with a good excuse. She finally picked up and told Ivie she could not talk because she had been caught by the police. She repeated the same line when the madam called. She then threw away her sim card, praying that they would believe her, and leave her and her family alone.\n\u2018Susan is back.\u201d The immigration lawyer was on the phone to De Masi. Susan had made it to Rome, and found the lawyer\u2019s office before nightfall. \u201cShe has nowhere to go.\u201d An hour later, De Masi was at the lawyer\u2019s office. Five months had passed, and Susan looked very different from the distant and defensive girl De Masi had met in Ponte Galeria. \u201cShe was outraged that someone she had trusted could put her in danger,\u201d De Masi told me. This time Susan wanted to talk. She wanted justice. \u201cShe was angry as hell,\u201d said De Masi.\nAfter De Masi picked Susan up from the immigration lawyer\u2019s office, she helped to get her into a shelter. In the weeks that followed, she began to gather Susan\u2019s testimony. Susan\u2019s information was detailed, reliable and well documented. \u201cShe had provided a copy of her notebook, photos, names and personal information about her traffickers,\u201d De Masi said. Filing criminal justice complaints is a way for women who have been trafficked to regain a feeling of power, De Masi said. Be Free\u2019s lawyer Carla Quinto pointed out that it can also afford them better protection: if traffickers threaten a survivor after she presses charges, police forces are usually quicker to intervene.\nEven with the evidence Susan had amassed, De Masi and Quinto knew how hard it would be to put together a case against her traffickers. Of the 70 survivors\u2019 cases that Be Free handles every year, no more than three go to trial, and almost never for human trafficking or slavery. Criminal charges are usually dropped, or reduced to exploitation of prostitution, which is a misdemeanour. \u201cIn the end, many cases go to trial for minor crimes with evidence that is easier to get,\u201d Quinto explained.\nThe difficulty of bringing traffickers to justice is a global problem. The International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates that there are currently about 40 million victims of modern slavery in the world, more than the population of Canada. Yet, at a global level, fewer than 12,000 prosecutions are brought against traffickers every year, resulting in fewer than 10,000 convictions.\nOne reason convicting traffickers is so hard is because the crime usually involves large numbers of criminals working in multiple jurisdictions. At each step along her journey to Europe, Susan had been picked up by different sets of middle men, who were co-ordinating their operations via phone with Ivie, her madam in Italy. In Libya, Susan had been locked up for two weeks in a makeshift jail, crowded with people who were waiting to cross the sea to Europe. The madam would regularly check in with the Nigerian and Arab men who served as jailers. The lack of investigative collaboration with Nigeria, Niger and Libya made it impossible to investigate or prosecute any of the middle men involved in Susan\u2019s trafficking.\nThe number of investigations into trafficking to Italy dropped steeply from 2014 onwards, just as there was a spike in arrivals of Nigerian women and girls without visas. According to a US state department report, published in June this year, only 135 people in Italy were investigated for trafficking in 2019, compared to 314 in 2018, and 482 in 2017. The report said the Italian authorities \u201cdid not meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking\u201d. The lack of interpreters from west Africa who can translate intercepted phone calls was one obstacle. But people working with survivors believe that there is a widespread lack of interest in prosecuting traffickers, due in part to the fact that a large number of survivors are Black women.\nDe Masi, who has worked for Be Free for more than 20 years, believes the hardening of attitudes towards migrants among Italian law enforcement authorities is not a recent phenomenon. After the Balkan wars and the rise of organised crime in post-communist eastern Europe, De Masi and her colleagues noticed increasing numbers of women who were being trafficked for sex. At first, it was often the police who would bring women off the streets to the shelter. But after Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s rightwing government issued new legislation in 2009 to clamp down on undocumented migrants, the police attitude towards sex-trafficking victims started to change. \u201cThe police priority was no longer to bring survivors to an anti-trafficking organisation or to women\u2019s shelters and help them,\u201d De Masi said. \u201cWhat became crucial was whether women had their documents in order. Criminalisation of migration became the priority.\u201d\nIn spite of the danger to witnesses and their families, the Italian system puts the onus on survivors to press charges against their traffickers. If survivors do file a complaint, their families back home are at risk of retaliation. Under an agreement between Italy and Nigeria, Italian police forces may alert Nigerian authorities so that they can protect survivors\u2019 relatives once a complaint has been filed, but this measure has proven ineffective. De Masi says that whenever she has made a request to protect a woman\u2019s family, the Nigerian authority responsible for fighting human trafficking has failed to respond. Several of Quinto\u2019s clients\u2019 families have been attacked. In one case, a survivor\u2019s mother was killed.\nIn March 2016, about a month after Susan fled to Rome, Ivie sent men to her mother\u2019s house in Nigeria. They beat her badly and left a message for Susan: \u201cGo back to your madam.\u201d The threat had the opposite effect. After her mother told Susan what had happened, she grew more determined than ever. She saw the criminal complaint as the only means to fight back and protect her family.\nIn May, a criminal complaint was filed against Ivie on Susan\u2019s behalf. De Masi and Quinto knew Susan\u2019s chance of winning justice was small. According to Quinto, the outcome often depends on the attitudes of whoever happens to be the prosecutor on the case. Previous complaints had been dismissed by police officers, investigating magistrates and prosecutors who did not take the women\u2019s stories seriously, or dragged their feet, given the difficulty of gathering enough evidence for a successful prosecution. But this time, they were in luck.\nSusan\u2019s case ended up in the offices of the anti-mafia directorate in Florence, close to where she had been forced into prostitution for the first time. Because of their complexity, in Italy human trafficking investigations are managed by local anti-mafia directorates \u2013 special prosecutors\u2019 units created in the early 90s to coordinate investigations into organised crime in Italy.\nThe woman who picked up her file was an experienced special prosecutor named Angela Pietroiusti. Five months earlier, she had launched an investigation into sex trafficking in Tuscany, and ordered surveillance of the apartment in Prato where Ivie kept the girls. She was building a case by following the women\u2019s activities, but needed access to communications between the traffickers.\n\u201cThe information offered by Susan\u2019s criminal complaint coincided perfectly with what we were finding in our investigation,\u201d Pietroiusti told me. \u201cShe was incredibly reliable. She provided her madam\u2019s phone number and the names of the other girls.\u201d As one of the few prosecutors handling human trafficking cases in her office, Pietroiusti was able to make a connection between Susan\u2019s criminal complaint and the investigation she had recently started. Thanks to the detailed information Susan had provided, in June 2016 Pietroiusti obtained authorisation for a wiretap.\n\u201cTrafficking cases are as complex as mafia cases,\u201d Pietroiusti told me when I met her in her office overlooking the city of Florence, with Brunelleschi\u2019s dome and the Tuscan hills in the distance. Pietroiusti is in her early 60s, and that day was wearing a sparkling blue glittery top, which made for a vivid contrast with metal detectors at the entrance of the building and the security guards outside her office \u2013 grim reminders of the dangers of her work. She remembers the names of all the survivors of the cases she worked on, and those of their traffickers.\nOnce they got the wiretaps in place, together with police officers and translators, Pietroiusti spent hundreds of hours building the case. One of the challenges was finding people who could translate from Igbo into Italian. The Nigerian community in Italy is not large, and most recent migrants are afraid of causing trouble for themselves and their families. \u201cBut we managed to find some of them,\u201d Pietroiusti said with a smile.\nWiretaps and surveillance revealed that Ivie was part of an international network. Together with other madams, she moved young women, some under 18, across several European countries. The investigation also revealed that Ivie had herself worked in the streets as a sex worker for a few years before becoming a madam. She had built a thriving business, and trained her 24-year-old daughter to run it for her, exploiting women her own age and younger. Half a dozen people were investigated, but in January 2017, just four madams, including Ivie\u2019s daughter, were indicted for trafficking 17 young women and girls from Nigeria to Italy.\nIt had taken Pietroiusti a year to gather enough proof to file a request for an arrest warrant, and it would take two more years for the judge to sign it. By the time the four madams were arrested, it was three years since Susan had filed her criminal complaint. Complex cases, such as ones involving human trafficking, tend to be passed over by judges, Pietroiusti said with a sigh, as they require more time and work to evaluate. Susan\u2019s case involved thousands of pages of phone records and transcribed conversations. \u201cI am not without sin,\u201d Pietroiusti told me, \u201cbut among all the requests I get, I try to prioritise those cases that threaten human dignity.\u201d\nIn trafficking cases, witnesses need both physical protection \u2013 they often live in shelters with secret addresses \u2013 and emotional support. Some survivors are so scared of their traffickers that they deny they were trafficked and forced into prostitution, even when they are presented with the evidence. Interviewing them requires careful strategy and sensitivity. To make the process less traumatic, sometimes Pietroiusti travels long distances to meet them in their secret shelters, where they feel more secure. Pietroiusti also has a rule: she only asks questions when it is strictly necessary. \u201cThe less you interview them, the better it is,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for them.\u201d There is also a need for absolute confidentiality. \u201cAs much as you can recommend them to keep it private, they are still girls \u2013 they might talk to a friend about it, and word of the investigation may get around.\u201d\nIn addition to witness testimony, the wiretaps also offered a window into the violence that the victims experienced on a daily basis. One underage girl, Marianne, was raped at a gunpoint by a client \u2013 a man who had posed as a police officer \u2013 and then forced to get an abortion. She had been trafficked to Italy in 2016 by the same woman who had brought Susan from Nigeria. The madam was frustrated by Marianne\u2019s meagre earnings: \u201cYou didn\u2019t come to Europe to play!\u201d she shouted at her in a phone conversation that was intercepted by agents.\nIn August 2016, once she had realised Marianne was under 18, Pietroiusti instructed police officers to stop her in the streets and take her to a shelter for minors while surveillance on the other women continued. But Marianne, frightened and alone, ran away and went back to the madam, the only adult she knew in Italy. The fact that victims are undocumented, and tend not to trust the police, means they become even more dependent on their traffickers.\nWhen police officers stopped Marianne again and tried to put her in a shelter for the second time, she escaped again. This time the madam transferred her to France, together with another underage girl. The trafficker called them \u201cthe little ones\u201d, Pietroiusti said. By the time arrest warrants were issued for the four Nigerian madams, police had lost all trace of the girls.\nCases such as these take a toll. \u201cThey don\u2019t let you sleep at night,\u201d Pietroiusti said.\nWhen De Masi learned that Susan\u2019s evidence had finally led to arrests, she was taken aback. \u201cSo much time had passed, I thought the case had been dismissed,\u201d De Masi told me. A pre-trial hearing was set for July 2019, and Susan took the train to Florence. She was nervous but determined. Seeing De Masi and Quinto waiting for her at the station was a relief.\nBe Free rented an apartment so that Quinto could help Susan prepare for the hearing. The lawyer established the most important thing: that the woman who had trafficked Susan would not see her. The judge would hear the witnesses in court, one by one, but the defendants would be in a separate room in the courthouse, following their testimonies via videolink. The survivors\u2019 faces would not be on camera, only their backs.\n\u201cYou deserve the princess room,\u201d De Masi told her, giving her the biggest room in the apartment, with a queen-size bed and a television. Susan laughed, pleased with the privacy and comfort. She had spent years in a shelter, sharing her room, bathroom and kitchen with other women. Before going to sleep, Susan took some selfies with De Masi and Quinto. \u201cIt was nice to stay with both of them, they are so funny,\u201d Susan told me, laughing. She reminded me what Quinto, who has salt-and-pepper short hair and always wears jeans and tennis shoes, often says: \u201cClients like me because I don\u2019t look like a lawyer.\u201d\nThe morning of the hearing, Susan wore a bright T-shirt with the words: \u201cI must be successful.\u201d Nine survivors were due to speak as witnesses in the trial. To protect them from crossing paths with their traffickers, Pietroiusti invited them to wait in her office. As more survivors arrived, Susan remembered her time with the girls as a stretch of lonely, desperate days. Seeing Hillary particularly upset her. \u201cShe is bad,\u201d Susan told De Masi, remembering how Hillary would control her and the other girls. De Masi told Susan she believed Hillary was a victim like her.\nHillary was the only one who had paid back her \u20ac30,000 debt entirely. Her madam had celebrated the final payment by asking for another \u20ac2,000 as a \u201cgift\u201d and offering Hillary the opportunity to become a madam herself. Hillary\u2019s father, who lived in Nigeria, had been working closely with Ivie, and had recruited his own daughter, as well as other girls. The investigation revealed that he had pressured Hillary to work overtime, so that she could pay her debt and become a madam \u2013 something that she never did.\nAs Susan waited her turn to give evidence, there were moments of tension. One of the survivors got a bad headache. \u201cIt\u2019s the juju!\u201d she screamed, convinced that she was being punished because she was about to betray her madam, to whom she had sworn an oath of loyalty back in Nigeria. The traditional ritual is very frightening, and exerts power over the young women long after they have left their home. \u201cUsing these very old belief systems passed down through generations is a psychological form of control that is much stronger than any violence,\u201d Princess Inyang Okokon, who runs Piam Onlus, an anti-trafficking NGO, told the Guardian in 2017.\nAs other women got anxious, De Masi took out her phone. In 2018, she had spent two months in Nigeria\u2019s Edo state to research the country\u2019s anti-trafficking efforts. That year, in an attempt to curb trafficking to Europe, Oba Ewuare II, the spiritual ruler of the kingdom of Benin, held a sacred ceremony to revoke all curses that sealed the debt bondage and set victims free. De Masi, who had been present, showed a video of the ceremony to the girls. \u201cEverybody calmed down,\u201d she told me.\nWhen Susan\u2019s turn to see the judge came, she was shaking, but she quickly got over her nerves. \u201cI started telling the truth, and I became so relaxed,\u201d she told me. She said it felt like a weight had been lifted from her.\nThe trial was set for five months later, on 13 December 2019. The defendants had chosen a fast-track trial \u2013 a tool in Italian law that speeds up the criminal process and, in case of conviction, allows a reduction of the sentence. The trial would last just one day. None of the victims were required to attend in person, but De Masi and Quinto were there to see the traffickers, who had caused so much pain and suffering, brought to justice. \u201cThere was no way I was going to miss this day,\u201d De Masi told me.\nAfter the closing arguments, prosecutor Angela Pietroiusti invited De Masi and Quinto into her office to wait for the judge\u2019s decision. They made small talk and chain smoked. At 7pm, Pietroiusti\u2019s landline rang.\nThe four defendants were sentenced to a total of 45 years for trafficking 10 girls to Italy and forcing them into slavery. When she heard the sentence, De Masi cried. \u201cIt was as if justice had been served not only for Susan, but for all the other women we had worked with,\u201d she told me. De Masi and Quinto bought a bottle of wine to celebrate on the train back to Rome. As their train was leaving, they called Susan to tell her that Ivie had been sentenced to 16 years and eight months. \u201cOh Jesus!\u201d Susan screamed, overjoyed.\nThe judge had ordered the trafficker to pay Susan \u20ac80,000 compensation, and \u20ac10,000 costs to Be Free. But neither of them will likely ever see the money. Human traffickers tend to send their profits back to their home countries (wiretaps had revealed that Susan\u2019s madam had boasted about owning several houses in Nigeria), and leave no assets in Italy.\nNot everybody involved in Susan\u2019s trafficking was prosecuted. The madam she had been transferred to in northern Italy was never identified, nor were the male traffickers involved in her journey from Nigeria to Italy. The law usually pursues the madams, but, as Quinto pointed out, 90% of them have been forced into prostitution themselves. The men who are the key players in Libya, Europe and Nigeria remain beyond reach.\nFor Susan, Ivie\u2019s conviction was more than had she hoped for. But things did not get easier for her. In autumn 2018, the so-called Salvini decree \u2013 named after the far-right politician who was then deputy prime minister of Italy \u2013 introduced a series of measures that made it more difficult for survivors of trafficking such as Susan to renew their immigration status and rebuild their lives.\nFour years after she escaped her traffickers and filed the criminal complaint that would uncover an international trafficking network, Susan\u2019s life is still in limbo. She has no work permit. She would like to go back to school, but more than anything she wants to be able to work and help her family back home. \u201cI\u2019d like to do any job,\u201d she told me. \u201cIf I could choose, I would like to help old women.\u201d She is now waiting for the Italian asylum commission to re-evaluate her case and to have her documents renewed.\nDe Masi has been helping Susan fight for her right to remain in Italy and rebuild a life here. As one of the key witnesses in a trafficking trial, it is too dangerous for her to go back to Nigeria. \u201cWe should roll out a red carpet for trafficking survivors,\u201d De Masi told me. \u201cFrom immigration offices to prosecutors\u2019 offices, every door should be wide open to them. But everything remains so difficult.\u201d\nSome names in this piece have been changed.\nReporting for this story was supported by the Global Migration Project at Columbia Journalism School.\n Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

        "content": "Vice-president does not mention Jacob Blake as he champions \u2018law and order on the streets\u2019 amid protests\nIn the shadow of deepening unrest in Wisconsin, Mike Pence warned darkly of the violence and mayhem that would ensue under a Democratic administration during a keynote address on the third night of the Republican national convention on Wednesday.\nThe vice-president, speaking from Fort McHenry in Baltimore, where the raising of the American flag during the war of 1812 inspired Francis Scott Key to write the poem that would later become The Star-Spangled Banner, echoed several conservative speakers in painting a dystopian portrait of America\u2019s major cities and accusing the Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden, of tolerating violence and vandalism.\n\u201cThe hard truth is you won\u2019t be safe in Joe Biden\u2019s America,\u201d Pence said, after formally accepting his re-nomination to be vice president on a stage bedecked with American flags.\nPence, who leads the White House coronavirus taskforce, was one of the few speakers during the convention to acknowledge the devastating impact of the pandemic, calling it a \u201ctime of testing\u201d for the nation. Recasting Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign slogan, he vowed that a second term would \u201cmake America great again, again\u201d.\nPence spoke hours after a curfew was instituted in the Wisconsin suburb of Kenosha, where protests continued for a fourth night in response to the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, by a white police officer.\nBut the vice-president made no mention of Blake, whose lawyers have said he is paralyzed, nor did he address the arrest of a white 17-year-old, who was charged with homicide after two people were shot dead and another seriously wounded apparently in connection with the protests on Tuesday night. The teenager\u2019s social media accounts suggest he was a supporter of law enforcement groups and Trump.\nInstead, he forcefully condemned acts of arson and violence that have unfolded alongside peaceful demonstrations this summer.\n\u201cLet me be clear, the violence must stop, whether in Minneapolis, Portland or Kenosha,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will have law and order on the streets of this country for every American of every race and creed and color.\u201d\nHe continued with a full-throated endorsement of law enforcement: \u201cUnder President Trump, we will stand with those who stand on the thin blue line, and we\u2019re not going to defund the police \u2013 not now, not ever.\u201d\nYet as Pence spoke, solidarity with protesters and calls for police reform were once again sweeping the nation, spreading from the streets of Kenosha to the NBA bubble in Orlando, where the league postponed three playoff games after the Milwaukee Bucks refused to take the floor on Wednesday evening. Their refusal to play prompted teams and athletes across the country to join the boycott in a dramatic stand against racial injustice.\nTrump and his political allies have used the occasion of this week\u2019s convention to reinforce the image of Trump as a \u201claw and order\u201d president, who will protect Americans from rising crime (it is not rising) and violent demonstrations (protests have been overwhelmingly peaceful) that supposedly threaten to spread from urban centers to every corner of the country. Those appeals, potent in the 1960s, are increasingly out of step with modern public opinion.\nYet the intense focus on rioting and chaos during the convention, as opposed to the coronavirus pandemic, indicates that Republicans believe a \u201claw-and-order\u201d message is their best hope of capturing moderate, suburban voters who are uncomfortable with the president\u2019s style.\nHow voters in Wisconsin respond to the unrest could determine whether the president is re-elected: the state is one of the most fiercely contested in this election and in 2016 Trump was the first Republican to carry Kenosha county in decades.\nEarlier on Wednesday, Biden said he had spoken to the Blake family and promised that \u201cjustice must and will be done\u201d while also condemning \u201cneedless violence\u201d.\n\u201cThe contrast tonight couldn\u2019t be clearer: we can choose four more years of fear, division, and hate,\u201d Biden said after Pence\u2019s address. \u201cOr we can choose a different path \u2013 one of hope, unity and light. Let\u2019s overcome this era of darkness, together.\u201d\nAs it did during the first two nights of the convention, the Republican convention\u2019s program swerved between speakers who painted dire portraits of an America threatened by mob rule and those who sought to cast the Trump presidency as one that ushered in a new era of inclusion, racial equality and gender parity.\n\u201cIt took 244 years to build this great nation, flaws and all, but we stand to lose it in a tiny fraction of that time if we continue down the path taken by Democrats and their radical supporters,\u201d said the South Dakota governor, Kristi Noem, whose remarks were taped before the unrest in Kenosha. \u201cFrom Seattle and Portland to Washington and New York, Democrat-run cities across this country are being overrun by violent mobs. The violence is rampant. There\u2019s looting, chaos, destruction and murder.\u201d\nAt the same time, testimonials from women close to the president \u2013 the senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway; the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany; the second lady, Karen Pence; and the president\u2019s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump \u2013 appeared aimed at appealing to suburban and religious women, as polling suggests their support continues to slip. National polling this summer found the gender gap among voters nearing historic levels.\n\u201cI want my daughter to grow up in President Donald Trump\u2019s America,\u201d McEnany said, after describing a thoughtful call she received from the president following a preventive mastectomy in 2018. His concern, she asserted, was a testament to Trump\u2019s commitment to protecting Americans with pre-existing conditions, even though he has actively worked to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which protects millions of people with such conditions.\nSeveral speakers also sought to appeal to racial minorities, casting Trump as a champion of criminal justice reform and racial reconciliation.\nJack Brewer, a former football player and a member of Black Voices for Trump, sought to soften one of the most controversial episodes of his presidency: Trump\u2019s response to the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville.\n\u201cAre you going to allow the media to lie to you, by falsely claiming that he said there were \u2018very fine\u2019 white supremacists in Charlottesville?\u201d Brewer said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say that! It\u2019s a lie!\u201d\nBut the reality is more complicated. In statements after the white nationalist violence, Trump equivocated and claimed \u201cboth sides\u201d were at fault even as he condemned their racism.\nIt is uncertain if the character references are enough to overcome opinions shaped after nearly four years of incendiary policies that include separating thousands of migrant children from their parents.\nPence extolled the president\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which he cast as a success even as the death toll neared 180,000. He called the US a \u201cnation of miracles\u201d and suggested a vaccine could be available within months.\nWhen he finished his remarks, he was joined by Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, who descended from the stage to shake hands along a rope line with supporters. Neither couple \u2013 nor members of the audience \u2013 wore a mask.\n This article was amended on 30 August 2020 because an earlier version mistakenly referred to Karen Pence as the first lady. This has been corrected to second lady.",

It was intended to inspire women to become pilots but has stoked controversy since it was released earlier this month.\nThe film runs with a disclaimer about taking creative liberties and dramatising events.\nWriting on New Delhi TV blog, Saxena, who flew helicopters, said there was no discrimination at organisational level when she joined the IAF and that she \u201cgot equal opportunities all the time\u201d.\nBut she defended much of the film, saying that she \u201calso combated the difficulties of prejudice and discrimination at the hands of a few individuals for being a woman\u201d.\n\u201cTo deny it completely speaks of a feudal mindset and undermines the grit of women officers,\u201d she said.\nRekha Sharma, chair of the National Commission for Women \u2013 a statutory body advising the government on women\u2019s issues \u2013 called for the film to be taken down.\nFormer and current members of the armed forces have questioned the portrayal of life in the services.\nIn one scene, a flight commander rushes into a briefing room and orders a newly commissioned Saxena to arm wrestle a male colleague. When she loses, he barks: \u201cYou\u2019re weak, Gunjan, and there is no place for weakness in defence services.\u201d\nThe commander adds: \u201cOur duty is to protect the country, not to give you equal opportunity.\u201d No one in the room stands up for Saxena. Earlier in the film, male officers are shown declining to fly with her in case she cries and questioning her abilities.\n\u201cThe entire arm-wrestling sequence was completely unbelievable, as are many other parts of the movie,\u201d said Archana Kapoor, who was among the first cohort of female pilots to join the IAF in 1994. She served for 10 years and said the film did not reflect her experiences.\n\u201cI can tell you with conviction that in no part of the forces would such a thing be allowed inside the work environment.\u201d\nKapoor admitted that in her early years in the force she served with a senior officer who didn\u2019t want his flights planned with her. \u201cHe just felt a bit apprehensive, as until then he wasn\u2019t assured of my skills.\u201d But once they were thrown together on a military exercise, he realised that she was capable and apologised for his previous comments.\nBindu Sebastian, who was also among the initial batch of female pilots, said: \u201cThere was no discrimination when I joined, only an initial reluctance in the acceptance of lady officers into the unit by one or two male officers.\u201d It was new territory for both women pilots and a male-dominated force, so this was expected, she added.\nKapoor recalled that the handful of sexist officers who did not believe in her abilities \u201cwere the same men who preferred to see their wives as homemakers, instead of career women\u201d.\nSeema Paul (name changed to protect identity), who has been in the army\u2019s engineering corps for 14 years, said she believed it was important for women to demonstrate that they are as capable as men of doing the job.\n\u201cAs in any other profession, it is incumbent upon new entrants to prove themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce that is established, she is treated on a par with her male colleagues.\u201d\nRetired IAF group captain N Kambhampati said that people who joined the armed forces came from diverse cultural backgrounds. \u201cSome may be old-fashioned, have roots in male-dominated communities or may have grown up with deep-rooted caste dynamics,\u201d he said. But training wore away such attitudes, he said.\nWomen were first inducted into India\u2019s armed forces in non-combat roles in 1992, as short service officers. Prior to that, they were only employed in the medical and nursing corps.\nFollowing a supreme court ruling earlier this year, women in all military services are now granted permanent commissions, making them eligible for the same command positions as their male counterparts. It makes the career more attractive for women, who can now continue serving until retirement.\nHowever, Saxena\u2019s biopic has been a dampener for 24-year-old Srishti Shukla and her friends who plan to pursue careers in the armed forces.\nShukla, who is from a village in northern Indian, said: \u201cThere is a different set of rules for men and women in my family and I\u2019ve lived with the hope that once I join the defence services, I\u2019ll get an equal platform with men, at least professionally.\u201d She said the film was \u201cvery disheartening\u201d.",

        "content": "Ex-election chief Patrick Heneghan says \u2018stab-in-the-back myth\u2019 is deflection tactic\nA senior Labour official accused of being one of a Corbyn-sceptic group who sabotaged the 2017 election has defended his colleagues\u2019 actions, saying the party would not have lost so badly two years later if a similar strategy had been followed.\nPatrick Heneghan, the then executive director for elections, said \u201celectoral oblivion\u201d had been the direct result of the departure of experienced staff because they were not loyal to Jeremy Corbyn.\n\u201cThe stab-in-the-back myth is their deflection from reality,\u201d he said. \u201cThe endless debate of this fantasy needs to be put to bed. Grand conspiracy theories offer nothing for a party that has been out of office for a decade so far.\u201d\nHe said Corbyn staff had demanded the party defund the campaigns of some prominent critics of the leadership and give extra resources to some key supporters who had bigger majorities.\nHeneghan said some staff, many of whom were named in a leaked internal report describing a \u201chyper-factional\u201d environment among party workers hostile to Corbyn, had set up a defensive campaign to save Labour seats rather than to deliberately defy the leadership.\nThe anonymously leaked report, which reignited painful divisions in the party, included hundreds of private WhatsApp messages from named staff, many of whom expressed hostility towards Corbyn or his close allies and bemoaned Labour\u2019s better-than-expected performance at the 2017 general election.\nSome workers are alleged to have used racist and sexist language to denigrate senior allies of Corbyn, including Diane Abbott.\nHeneghan said: \u201cRecent weeks have seen the growth in conspiracy theories suggesting there was some grand plan to \u2018throw\u2019 or \u2018sabotage\u2019 the 2017 election. This is not the reality but simply a deflection tactic to absolve the architects of the 2019 campaign of their culpability for a disastrous result.\u201d\nHe said party staff had expanded the target list to include 93 offensive seats at Corbyn\u2019s team\u2019s request, giving them extra digital advertising and key seat visits. But Heneghan said he refused to comply with a request in mid-May that some held seats should be defunded, some of which he considered \u201cvery marginal\u201d.\n\u201cThe seats to defund were largely MPs considered by Corbyn\u2019s team to be political opponents (many of them would fall to the Tories in 2019),\u201d he said. \u201cI was also given a list of seats that needed extra funding. Most of these had majorities of over 10,000 but were strong allies of the leadership.\u201d\nHeneghan said he would provide evidence of his claim to the independent inquiry into the leaked report and Labour\u2019s culture under Corbyn, chaired by Martin Forde QC.\nIn their submission to the party inquiry, Corbyn and his leadership team have accused hostile officials of setting up a \u201cshadow operation\u201d in a Westminster office as part of efforts to plot their own election course and defend anti-Corbyn MPs.\nHeneghan defended that action, saying 2017 polling had consistently showed that Corbyn was unpopular in \u201cred wall\u201d seats, many of which fell to the Tories in 2019.\n\u201cCorbyn\u2019s team were simply not prepared to take polling information seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we knew we couldn\u2019t acquiesce in allowing these seats to fall.\u201d He said campaigners at the party\u2019s headquarters then changed tactic to focus on local issues in those seats rather than the leadership.\nHeneghan said the loss of seats such as Mansfield, North East Derbyshire and Stoke South was proof the strategy was correct, adding that the campaign retained seats such as Dudley North, which was held by the Corbyn critic Ian Austin but fell to the Conservatives in 2019.\n\u201cI have heard it said that Labour could have been in power for just over 2,000 more votes in the right seats. It\u2019s also true that the Tories could have won a majority by moving a lot fewer votes the other way,\u201d he said.\n\u201cTo suggest these questions of judgment are akin to sabotage is laughable. Yes, there were differences of opinion on how to get the best result possible. In the end I think the balance between offensive, and defensive was probably just about right given the facts and data we had. It\u2019s hard to claim the balance was right in the 2019 Labour campaign.\u201d\nHe said WhatsApp messages in the leaked report, which appeared to show Labour officials sounding horrified at the party\u2019s advance, \u201comits our WhatsApp messages such as \u2018amazing, amazing, amazing\u2019\u2026 or the excitement when its confirmed it\u2019s a hung parliament\u201d.\nOfficials named in the report plan to take legal action against the party over data protection issues and libel as well invasion of privacy and, for some staff, breach of contract and employment.\nIn the formal submission to the inquiry by the officials accused of sabotage, which was leaked to the Guardian this month, the officials allege their WhatsApp messages were used to falsely make them seem racist and sexist.",

        "content": "Queensland\u2019s supreme court rejects the mining firm\u2019s bid, saying it could result in \u2018humiliation and family distress\u2019\nCoalmining company Adani asked a Queensland court for orders that would have allowed its representatives to conduct an unannounced search at the family home of an environmental activist.\nBut the supreme court rejected the move, noting the search could result in \u201chumiliation and family distress\u201d for Ben Pennings and others.\nAdani said on Wednesday it was suing Pennings, the national spokesperson of the group Galilee Blockade, which has sought to disrupt the operations of Adani, its suppliers and contractors.\nThe former Greens leader Bob Brown released a statement on Thursday, which said the legal action would \u201csend a shudder through every Australian who values democracy, free speech and the right to peaceful protest\u201d.\nAdani has steadfastly claimed, in repeated public statements, that the campaigns by activists had \u201cfailed\u201d to stop progress on the Carmichael project.\nIn the claim filed against Pennings, the company detailed financial loss from activist activities including the withdrawal of former contractors Downer EDI, AECOM and Greyhound Australia.\nAdani is also seeking damages from Pennings for intimidation and conspiracy, and court costs.\nAfter being served with legal documents, Pennings released a statement referring to two ex parte legal applications made by Adani \u2013 in the Queensland supreme court and the Queensland court of appeal \u2013 prior to its decision to launch the civil case.\nThey show Adani sought a so-called Anton Piller order to conduct a surprise search of Pennings\u2019 home, believing he held confidential Adani information the company sought to obtain before launching the court case.\nJudgments in the cases reveal Adani hired a private investigator who gave evidence to identify Pennings as the owner of premises in Brisbane, where he lives with his partner and three children.\nThe order sought by Adani was to \u201cpermit members of the search party to enter the premises so that they can carry out the search and other activities referred to in this order\u201d and permit them also \u201cto leave and re-enter the premises on the same day and the following day until the search and other activities referred to in this order are complete\u201d.\nCourt documents indicate the proposed search party would comprise two solicitors instructed by Adani Mining and an associated company, Carmichael Rail Network, an independent solicitor and an independent computer expert.\nAdani sought an order requiring Pennings to permit \u201cthe independent computer expert to search any electronic device and make a copy or digital copy of any electronic device and permit the independent computer expert to remove any electronic device from the premises\u201d.\n\u201cIf Mr Pennings were to object, then the independent solicitor would take the electronic devices.\u201d\nThe supreme court and the appeal court rejected the application. The appeal judgment cited commentary by Sir Hugh Laddie, the former high court of England and Wales judge credited with conceiving the idea for an Anton Piller order, which described them as \u201coffensive weapons\u201d.\n\u201cThey have the ability to harm their victims in many ways,\u201d Laddie said in the judgment.\n\u201cService of an ex parte order coupled with a demand for immediate entry into premises is likely to produce strong emotional reactions; shock, anger, confusion, a sense of violation and powerlessness are common recollections, even when orders are served by sensitive and tactful solicitors.\n\u201cThe execution of an order may cause severe, sometimes irreparable, physical disruption to a defendant\u2019s business or daily life: the process may take hours to complete.\u201d\nThe court of appeal refused the application citing the nature of the premises as a family home.\n\u201cSurely, to permit a search of a defendant\u2019s house, with the humiliation and family distress which that might involve, lies at the outer boundary of the discretion,\u201d the judgment states.\n\u201cThis is because, for reasons that anyone can understand, the \u2018shock, anger, confusion\u2019 and the \u2018sense of violation and powerlessness\u2019 will be much greater in such a case and may be suffered not only by someone who is proved in due course to be a wrongdoer, but by entirely innocent parties as well.\u201d\nIn a statement, Pennings said: \u201cMy wife and I have three school-aged children living at home, one with a disability.\n\u201cAdani has failed in two recent \u2026 applications to raid our family home for corporate secrets they believe I possess,\u201d the activist said.\n\u201cAdani\u2019s \u2018attack dog\u2019 legal strategy is well known. They want to silence dissent about their destructive thermal coal project that a majority of Australians oppose.\n\u201cAdani has already bankrupted traditional owner Adrian Burragubba. I will not let a massive multinational company threaten or bankrupt my family.\u201d\nAdani said its decision to launch legal action against Pennings was \u201cneeded to ensure our business can continue to deliver jobs and opportunities to regional Queensland communities at a time when they were needed most\u201d.\n\u201cAdani is claiming that Mr Pennings has orchestrated a sustained campaign of harassment and intimidation against Adani\u2019s business, employees, contractors and potential business partners spanning almost a decade.\u201d\nAlongside its activities conducting physical protests at Adani contractors, Galilee Blockade has run a \u201cdob in Adani\u201d campaign that solicits information from employees of the company and its contractors.\n\u201cThis legal action does not seek to limit free speech. As we have repeatedly stated, we believe a diversity of views is an important part of democracy,\u201d the company said.\n\u201cAdani is alleging that Mr Pennings has been instrumental in organising blockades and the occupation of offices and industrial premises of many of our existing and potential suppliers, as well as some organisations that have absolutely no association with Adani.\n\u201cAfter almost a decade of this type of intimidation, we are saying enough is enough.\u201d\nIn relation to its application for an Anton Piller order, Adani said the application would have enabled a solicitor appointed by the court to secure evidence for the civil case.\n\u201cThe court did not issue the Anton Piller order, however, we are able to pursue the civil claim regardless.\u201d",

More than 64m meals have been claimed in total since it began at the start of the month \u2013 the equivalent of one for almost every person in the country.\nThe initiative was designed to entice consumers back to hospitality venues by offering a half-price discount up to a maximum of \u00a310 per head on food and non-alcoholic drink from Mondays to Wednesdays in August and has gone so well that restaurants have called for the government to extend it.\nRestaurants are offering a range of special deals to customers during September in a bid to maintain trade once the government-funded scheme ends.\nHarvester, Stonehouse Pizza & Carvery and Toby Carvery, brands operated by pub and restaurant group Mitchells & Butlers, will offer a 50% discount on main meals on Monday to Wednesday in the first two weeks of September.\nThe Prezzo chain is offering a two-course set menu for \u00a310 from Monday to Wednesday in September, while Pizza Hut is offering 2-for-1 on main meals on those days for customers signed up to their database, and Tesco Caf\u00e9 has 50% off its full menu Monday to Wednesday throughout the month, with no limits on the discount.\nOn Wednesday the Federation of Small Businesses became the latest organisation to call on ministers to extend the scheme into September after lauding its success.\nDeliveroo will offer \u00a35 off an order of \u00a320 or more during the first three days of each week in September. The food delivery firm will offer cash off the first 100,000 orders at small restaurants each week in September.

Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain are both reported to be interested in signing Messi, although Manchester City are reported to be in the box-seat with one tabloid reporting the player\u2019s father is already in talks with the club. In the increasingly likely event of Messi\u2019s departure from the club he has served for 20 years, it remains to be seen who will be given the unenviable and frankly impossible task of filling his Adidas Nemeziz 19.1s.\n By his own lofty standards N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 had a fairly underwhelming season punctuated by injury at Chelsea but that hasn\u2019t put off Internazionale, whose policy of rehoming Premier League stars has enjoyed more than a modicum of success. The Serie A side need to offload another high profile player before they can bring him in and Lautaro Martinez, Milan Skriniar and Marcelo Brozovic are among those they would consider letting go to help fund the deal.\nHighly regarded QPR midfielder Eberechi Eze looks set to leave Loftus Road for pastures new, specifically the lush green rectangle of grass at Selhurst Park. Sky Sports News have reported the Crystal Palace have agreed a fee of \u00a316m rising to \u00a320m, with the Championships side insisting on a 20% sell-on clause that could yield them a pretty penny in years to come. Wolves full-back Matt Doherty is also on the move to Tottenham after 10 years of faithful service at Molineux. A fee of \u00a315m has been agreed and Doherty\u2019s former League of Ireland club Bohemians \u2013 for whom he never actually made a senior appearance \u2013 are in line for a bumper pay-day on the back of a clause they shrewdly included in the transfer deal between themselves and Wolves a decade ago.\nResigned to losing Doherty, Wolves are in search of a replacement and have identified Arsenal\u2019s Ainsley Maitland-Niles as the man for the job. An initial bid of \u00a315m for the 22-year-old has been rejected, with the Emirates beancounters confident they can hold out for a few quid more.Celtic\u2019s already slim chances of holding on to Odsonne \u00c9douard suffered a major blow following their meek exit from the Champions League at the hands of Hungarian side Ferencvaros. The striker missed last night\u2019s humiliation at Celtic Park, apparently through injury, but has been heavily linked with a move to Aston Villa. Crystal Palace, Leicester City and Arsenal are also reported to be keen. Following Celtic\u2019s earliest elimination from the competition in 15 years, manager Neil Lennon some of his players were distracted by interest from other clubs. \u201cGet your mentality right, get your attitude right,\u201d he said. \u201cIf some of you don\u2019t want to be here, leave.

However, he said he was concerned rates would increase when the jobkeeper payment, which will reduce from next month, expires in March.\n\u201cI do credit jobkeeper with having an enormous impact on reducing impacts on mental health,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cJust to know that there will be money coming into your account for the foreseeable future. We did feel a tangible drop in the temperature of people calling Lifeline [when it was announced].\u201d\nWhen that expired and the recession deepened, Brogden said, he expected to see \u201ca further increased demand for services, a further increase in calls to lifeline and a further increase in the risks of suicide\u201d.\n\u201cThat\u2019s when the tide goes out on all the supports that have been keeping people going, and the hard reality sets in.\u201d\nThe coronial data is the first released on rates of suicide in Australia during the pandemic, and follows months of speculation and warnings that the suicide rate would skyrocket as people struggled with isolation, job losses and the despair that comes from a global health crisis.\nBut demand for mental health services has increased. A survey of 200 people with mental illness, completed by the Victorian Mental Illness Awareness Council this week, found that more than half of all respondents had contemplated suicide, and either contemplated self-harm or actually self-harmed.\n\u201cThese are the people who already have mental illness, and we know there\u2019s an increase in people that are having suicidal ideation,\u201d the council\u2019s chief executive, Tricia Szirom, told Guardian Australia. That was more prevalence in people aged under 30.\nSzirom said people with mental illness who were previously coping well outside of the system \u2013 with regular psychological appointments and managed medication and other strategies \u2013 had suddenly hit a wall.\n\u201cThe lockdown is a problem \u2026 it\u2019s loneliness,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are lonely. A lot of people live alone \u2026 there\u2019s also a sense of despair. Will we ever get out of this? Are we going to have more pandemics?\u201d\nThe Victorian government last month reported a 33% increase in people being treated at emergency departments for intentional self-harm, and calls to support lines such as Lifeline and Beyond Blue have doubled.\nProf Pat McGorry told a Victorian parliamentary inquiry on Thursday that mental health modelling showed there could be an increase in suicides over the next three to four years, meaning there was still time to enact preventative measures \u201cbecause these people have not died yet\u201d.\n\u201cThe timescale might be affected by [the economy] but I think maybe the reason we haven\u2019t seen the deaths rise yet is because of the effectiveness of government policy so far,\u201d McGorry said. \u201cAnd probably also shows the intense distress that we all face. I think through the pandemic and the lockdowns, everyone\u2019s mental health has suffered a bit, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d\nJill Gallagher, the chief executive of the Victorian Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, told the inquiry that the numbers in the coroner\u2019s report did not track with what she said was a marked increase in suicides in the Aboriginal community, with four reported last week alone.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a humungous increase,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cI\u2019m not prepared to say what those numbers are, [but a] humungous increase in suicides.\u201d \n The organisation did not provide more detail, and the coroners court said it was unable to release a racial breakdown of its data.\nGeorgie Harman, the chief executive of Beyond Blue, said an increase in suicides was \u201cnot inevitable\u201d as financial supports such as jobkeeper and the increased jobseeker rate dropped, but that governments, services and individuals needed to be aware of the risk and maintain \u201ceternal vigilance\u201d. That included talking openly in an informed way about suicide.\nHarman said that since the stage-four lockdown began in Melbourne, two-thirds of calls to Beyond Blue had come from Victoria. The majority of those who called were under the age of 35.\nHarman said that while funding to mental health services had increased in response to the pandemic, \u201cwe know that the level of investment still does not match the level of demand\u201d.\nShe said funding should focus on wraparound services and be based on outcomes, not the level of activity it generates.\n Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14; Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78; Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636",

        "content": "Southall residents link redeveloped site to poor health, but developer says it complies with regulations\nResidents in Southall are calling on the government to urgently investigate the health impact of the redevelopment of an old gasworks in light of research suggesting the mainly south Asian community is highly susceptible to air pollution.\nFor a year the Guardian has followed the Clean Air for Southall and Hayes (Cash) campaign as they demanded answers from Ealing council, statutory bodies and scientists as to whether a \u201cpetrol-like\u201d odour which they say emanated from the site is causing symptoms such as breathing problems, nausea and mental confusion \u2013 and serious diseases. They want to know what will be done to eliminate future risks over the 25-year regeneration project.\n\u201cThere has been no proper investigation into how this contaminated site is affecting our health,\u201d said Angela Fonso, of Cash, which wants the government to initiate a detailed study on the impact of the site in the context of the local population, one of the most deprived in London. \u201cI don\u2019t believe this environmental injustice would happen in a more affluent white area.\u201d\nIt is thought that living in areas with toxic air is one of the reasons people from ethnic minorities have suffered a disproportionate number of deaths from Covid-19.\nA Public Health England (PHE) spokesperson said: \u201cThe local authority is responsible for the health of its local population and any public health studies or analyses are for the local authority and its public health team to either carry out or commission.\u201d\nThe site of the former gasworks and chemicals factory has been dogged by controversy since Boris Johnson used mayoral powers in 2010 to overrule Ealing council\u2019s decision against development. Since work began in 2016 to clean the 88-acre site of hydrocarbons including benzene, naphthalene and cyanide, dozens of residents in local streets have complained that a petrol-like smell from the site has been making them sick.\nBerkeley cleaned \u2013 or remediated \u2013 the soil on the site of contaminants in an open-air \u201csoil hospital\u201d. It was decided cleaning the soil was safer than transporting contaminated material along residential streets.\nIn July 2018 the Environment Agency (EA) was called in and ordered the Berkeley Group to take steps to mitigate the odour, which the developer complied with.\nCampaigners claim the problems have persisted and last year crowdfunded for consultation to pursue legal action against the developer. The Berkeley Group has said \u201cany legal action, if and when it materialises, will be vigorously opposed\u201d.\n\u201cNo one wants to take responsibility for us and we\u2019re paying the price with our lives. We\u2019ve been knocking on the doors of the council, PHE, EA and politicians for years,\u201d claimed Joginder Singh Bhangu, a campaigner. \u201cOur community has fallen through the cracks.\u201d\nBecause of its scale, the gasworks redevelopment has multiple regulators: it is up to the EA to regulate the soil and advise Ealing on management of land affected by contamination; Ealing has responsibility for investigating complaints of statutory nuisance; and PHE are supposed to protect the health of the public.\n\u201cCovid is showing that health is not just about numbers but about people,\u201d said Araceli Camargo, co-founder of Centric Lab, whose report argues that the health risks of the site can\u2019t be determined by the regulatory limits. The specific challenges to the health of people in Southall, such as overcrowding, stress and poverty, should have been evaluated before introducing a major new source of air pollution, she said.\nOn Beaconsfield Road, a long artery from the junction near the station along the site boundary to a primary school, Bhangu regularly checks on the health of neighbours. Many gardens adjoin the site, where almost 4,000 homes will be built. \u201cOf course we are more worried about coronavirus here, with all the chemicals,\u201d he said.\nThe Guardian has interviewed dozens of residents of Beaconsfield Road and nearby streets to ask about their health since 2016. Of 48 who returned questionnaires to the Guardian, all said they had suffered breathing problems, and 42 said symptoms had led them to the GP. Other symptoms reported included eye problems, headaches, mental confusion and nausea.\nArevik and Ashok Martirosyan invited the Guardian to see an oxygen chamber they had rented for their seven-year-old daughter after she began having fainting fits. Around the same time both parents said they had experienced vomiting attacks, and suggested the symptoms were linked to \u201cthis very bad smell from the site\u201d.\nAfter multiple complaints and the assessment of an air quality expert in January 2020 that chemical levels presented a threat to health, Ealing council said GPs\u2019 data showed no significant increase in asthma and cancer, and referred residents to a PHE report on the air monitoring data that says there is \u201cunlikely to be a direct toxicological risk to the health of the nearby population from the levels of VOCs [volatile organic compounds] detected\u201d.\nThat data \u2013 the only available \u2013 was provided by consultants for Berkeley, but residents believe Ealing should have conducted its own for comparison. The lack of any legal requirement for the council to do so, or for any of the regulators to act after PHE findings about chemical levels in March 2019, raises questions about the accountability to residents next to one of the UK\u2019s biggest brownfield sites.\nLast March PHE found that levels of naphthalene, a possible carcinogen, needed to be \u201creduced urgently\u201d to protect residents\u2019 long-term health. PHE told the Guardian to \u201cget in touch with Ealing council to find out what actions have been taken as a result of the findings in the public health risk assessment\u201d. Ealing council leader Julian Bell told residents in a virtual meeting on 16 July 2020 that chemical levels have been dropping since the soil hospital was dismantled last April.\nDr Onkar Sahota, a London assembly member and GP, said that \u2013 as the planning authority with the duty of care to residents \u2013 Ealing must establish its own independent monitoring of the site for the next phase of development.\n\u201cThe cost of the independent monitoring consultants should be borne by the developer. Representatives of Cash should be on the appointment panel in equal number to those from Ealing council for appointing the new independent consultants to monitor for air quality, carcinogenic and noxious pollutants in the atmosphere,\u201d said Sahota, who said work should stop while the health impact is investigated.\nEaling council said it was \u201cdetermining the criteria for establishing an independent air quality monitoring network around the development\u201d.\nIn any case, the data PHE looked at does not exclude risks to health. Air quality expert Prof Roy Harrison from the University of Birmingham told the Guardian: \u201cThe VOCs here are much higher than you would expect to see in normal streets,\u201d adding that there would be little dilution of air pollution from the site at homes on the boundary and that naphthalene is \u201cefficient\u201d at getting indoors.\nData he saw \u201cwell exceeded\u201d PHE\u2019s own guidelines for naphthalene, he said. \u201cIn one report, consultants had performed a calculation to estimate the likely annual average concentrations of pollutants, including naphthalene. This gave an annual mean in excess of the WHO recommendation of 10 micrograms per cubic metre. Notably, in a recent report, PHE recommended a lower guideline of 3 micrograms per cubic metre.\u201d\nProf Alan Boobis, a toxicologist from Imperial College, said many chemicals, including naphthalene, could explain residents\u2019 symptoms, and stressed the mental toll of worrying about the air they breathe. \u201cOnce people are aware that chemical levels are excessive and associated with harm, they react badly to this toxicity and the behavioural response is real,\u201d he suggested, likening this to post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\u201cWhat we are seeing [on such sites] is the legacy of the past industrial age. Perhaps in this case more soil should have been removed.\u201d\nResidents are now bracing for the next phase of the Southall Waterside development, when National Grid will remediate soil around the blue gas-holder that once signalled the way for planes arriving at Heathrow. It said it had taken \u201csignificant control measures\u201d after seeing residents\u2019 video testimonials about the impact of the site.\nFonso said: \u201cWe want work to cease at Southall Waterside for mitigation measures to be improved during any remediation and for Berkeley to follow the lead of National Grid, which is erecting enclosures, air-filtering systems and removing contaminated soil from the site to protect residents from harmful odours, vapours and dust.\u201d\nBerkeley did not comment on any plans for further remediation, saying: \u201cThis is a highly regulated activity and all work has been closely monitored and approved by the authorities, including the London Borough of Ealing and Environment Agency.\u201d\nResidents worried about the planned Berkeley St William gasworks developments in East London, and in Brighton, have contacted the Southall campaign for advice.\nBhangu, stopping to talk to an elderly neighbour on Beaconsfield Road, said: \u201cWhat would I say to the other communities where there will be a gasworks redevelopment? Get ready for the nightmare.\u201d\nProf Kevin Fenton, London regional director for PHE, said: \u201cThe Southall Waterside air quality data provided to PHE has been compared to a variety of available health-based air quality guidelines \u2026 for the detected chemicals. The results from our assessments show that there is unlikely to be a risk to the long-term health of the nearby population from chemicals detected.\u201d",

At least 39 people have been killed in the spate of violence that has stretched across the country.\nOn Saturday, six people were killed in Tumaco, a port city near the southern border with Ecuador, just days after the provincial governor warned that the region was descending into a \u201cstate of anarchy\u201d. That same day, three people were shot dead near Medell\u00edn, Colombia\u2019s second city, while three more were murdered in Arauca, in the country\u2019s eastern plains.\nSo far this year, Colombia has seen 46 massacres, defined as the murder of three or more people in a single act of killing, according to local conflict watchdog Indepaz.\n\u201cWe are living in a state of constant fear,\u201d said one community leader near Oca\u00f1a who asked not to be named for fear of reprisal. \u201cWe know that we could be killed at any time, and that the government will do little to save us.\u201d\nA 2016 peace deal with the country\u2019s largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), formally ended five decades of civil war that killed more than 260,000 people and displaced 7 million.\nThe accord was supposed to bring with it increased security and development to Colombia\u2019s poorest regions but such change has been elusive, with dissident Farc factions fighting for territorial control with a rival leftist guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army, ELN, rightwing paramilitary groups, drug cartels and the Colombian military.\nThe violence has been particularly felt by human rights activists, with more than 100 murdered this year, while the pandemic has also led armed groups to exert control. At least 30 people have been murdered for breaking quarantines, according to a local university.\nObservers say that president Iv\u00e1n Duque \u2013 a skeptic of the peace deal he inherited when he took office two years ago \u2013 has not done enough to guarantee its implementation.\n\u201cThe government has failed to follow the roadmap laid out by the peace deal,\u201d said Sergio Guzm\u00e1n, director of Colombia Risk Analysis, a thinktank. \u201cAnd unless that changes and we see a genuine development and not just a military response, these killings will continue.\u201d\nDuque has blamed the recent bloodshed on drug-trafficking groups, and ordered the armed forces to be \u201cimplacable\u201d in their response. He drew sharp criticism on Saturday, when he appeared to downplay the massacres by describing them as \u201ccollective homicides\u201d.\nWhile the current wave of massacres has prompted comparisons with the peak of the conflict in the late 1990s \u2013 when both massacres and murders were commonplace \u2013 analysts say that the current dynamics of the armed groups are more complicated.\n\u201cIn the past you had clear ideological lines and motives, whereas now you have fragmented groups with their own fiefdoms,\u201d said Gimena S\u00e1nchez, Andes director at the Washington Office on Latin America. \u201cUnless we see a radical change in political will by Duque and the economic elites of the country, things will continue to deteriorate.\u201d",

        "content": "Annette Bening and Bill Nighy are terrific as a middle-aged couple who have everything \u2013 except a happy relationship\nThe last film playwright-screenwriter William Nicholson wrote was Breathe, a based-on-a-true-story drama about a deeply happy marriage challenged by the inability of the husband \u2013 a polio survivor \u2013 to breathe without a respirator. With Hope Gap, Nicholson\u2019s adaptation of his own late-80s stage play The Retreat from Moscow, the dynamics are flipped, presenting the story of a couple who have just about everything a middle-class retired couple could want \u2013 security, a lovely house on the English south coast, their health \u2013 apart from a happy marriage.\nLight-stepping, terminally recessive schoolteacher Edward (Bill Nighy, dialling it down to give one of best performances in years) has fallen out of love with his perpetually critical, intellectually rigorous wife Grace (Annette Bening), who has been compiling an anthology of poetry for years. When their adult son Jamie (Josh O\u2019Connor, exceedingly good at projecting shy vulnerability beneath a superficial cheeriness) comes for a visit, Edward reveals his plans to end the marriage and move out, forcing Jamie to act as a mediator between his muddled father and raging, wounded mother.\nAt one point, Jamie talks about how happy he had been years ago, walking to Hope Gap on the coast as he swung between each parent. That symbolism, echoing how he\u2019s trying to manage his parents now, is painfully on the nose. In fact, there are a few too many whopping bits of literary clever-clogging in the dialogue, such as a reference to how the revert function on Wikipedia entries operates as a metaphor for soured relationships.\nNevertheless, the performances are terrific, especially from Bening who adds yet another deeply nuanced study to her gallery of complicated, smart women of a certain age. It\u2019s up there with her turns in The Kids Are All Right and 20th Century Women. Anna Valdez-Hanks\u2019 limpid cinematography, capturing the cool, flat light of the British seaside, is also a plus.\nHope Gap is in cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema from 28 August",

        "content": "After 22 months and four cancelled fights, Isaac Chamberlain was finally back in the ring on Saturday \u2013 in surreal circumstances forced by Covid-19. This is the story of three days inside the bubble\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the bubble, bro,\u201d Isaac Chamberlain exclaimed as, rather than bumping elbows, he gave me a bear-like hug in a Covid testing room at a Holiday Inn on the outskirts of Redditch, near Birmingham, last Thursday morning. It was easy to understand the 26-year-old boxer\u2019s readiness to demolish social distancing measures because he was just 60 hours away from making his return to the ring. We also knew that, as soon as we had been tested, we would be confined to a strict quarantine. It was one last embrace before another lockdown.\nThe Brixton cruiserweight was desperate to resume his career which had been put on hold the previous 22 months.\nA chain of small catastrophes \u2013 including the jailing of his American promoter, broken promises and the onset of a global pandemic \u2013 meant that his past four scheduled fights had been cancelled. But Chamberlain, who is one of boxing\u2019s most intelligent and intriguing fighters, was on the cusp of a comeback in the sport\u2019s first promotion on British terrestrial television since the coronavirus turned the world upside down.\nI had become friendly with Chamberlain after first interviewing him nine months ago. As an 11-year-old boy he had delivered drugs for gangs in south London but, since boxing helped him escape that brutal landscape, Chamberlain had been determined to one day become a world champion. That might seem a familiar backstory but Chamberlain examines his life and writes about it with an introspection and eloquence that is different to most fighters.\nHis mask was blue, and mine was black, but the crinkly folds around his eyes told me Chamberlain was smiling. A Covid test was one of the final barriers before he could fight again. His new promoter, Mick Hennessy, who helped Carl Froch and Tyson Fury become world champions, waited outside with his son, Michael, another fighter on last Saturday night\u2019s bill.\nChamberlain moved to the designated spot, where the nurse waited, and slipped off his mask. He opened his mouth so a swab could be taken. A nasal swab followed and both were sealed in sterilised containers. There was nothing else we could do but wait for the results.\nThe fighters, Hennessey\u2019s promotional team, British boxing board officials and I disappeared to our respective rooms. Meals came and went, delivered to our doors with a quiet knock. I worked, swapped messages with Chamberlain and looked out of the third floor window. The words \u201cNO EXIT\u201d were painted on the road outside. We were going nowhere.\nAt 10pm I heard voices outside. When it was my turn I received cheerful confirmation that I had tested negative for coronavirus. A black bracelet, worn on my wrist, carried the message: Testing Passed. Everyone in our bubble was clear. Saturday night\u2019s promotion, and every fight on the bill, was on.\nNone of us left the hotel for the next 44 hours but, just before lunchtime on Friday, the familiar ritual of the weigh-in unfolded in the same room we had been tested. Paul Booth, the shaven-headed MC, wore a blue suit and a black bow-tie as he called each fighter to the scales.\nChamberlain ambled over in white socks and sliders. He wore his mask, tracksuit bottoms and a black T-shirt which said End Racism on the back. The fighter stood barefoot and bare-chested on the scales, wearing his mask, and Booth confirmed he had made the cruiserweight limit. Chamberlain\u2019s squat opponent, Antony Woolery, who had a modest record of two wins and two losses, looked as if he was trying to hide a little paunch as they did the traditional face-off in masks. The difference between their physiques was stark \u2013 and it was obvious which of the contrasting pair had been awarded a five-year contract by Hennessy.\nBoxing is still a psychological ordeal. The night before a fight always drags. Hennessy\u2019s son, Michael, a baby-faced 20-year-old middleweight, broke the unsettling monotony. He and his trainer Junior Saba stepped into the corridor on the third floor where most of us were in our isolated rooms. The whappity-whap thud of gloves smacking into pads echoed outside the elevator as Hennessy Jr and Saba killed time that Friday night.\nFight day was another slow trial. But, with a languid Chamberlain setting the mood, the morning was strangely relaxed. I spoke to both Hennessy Sr and Jr as they reflected on their roles as promoter and fighter. \u201cThis is the most unusual promotion I\u2019ve ever run, and I\u2019ve been through plenty of strange ones,\u201d Hennessy Sr said wryly. \u201cIt\u2019s been difficult because it\u2019s our first bubble, and the first night of boxing on terrestrial television, but everything\u2019s gone well.\u201d\nThe headline bout was a British light-heavyweight title fight between Shakan Pitters and Chad Sugden. The 6ft 6in Pitters, alongside Chamberlain, represents Hennessy\u2019s new wave of fighters. \u201cThey\u2019re very charismatic and hugely promising fighters,\u201d Hennessy said of Pitters and Chamberlain. \u201cYou just have to spend time with Isaac to know he\u2019s special. He lights up the room. We can get three million tuning into Channel 5 so I\u2019m excited to build Isaac\u2019s name on terrestrial television.\u201d\nHennessy had reconciled himself to the fact his son was consumed by boxing. The promoter tried to keep him away from the ring but, finally, when Michael was 11, he allowed his boy to join a gym in Kent. After Michael had won his third amateur bout, Hennessy told his son how proud he was as he tucked him up in bed. \u201cI\u2019d just turned off his light,\u201d Hennessy remembered, \u201cand he said: \u2018Hey, Dad? 3 and 0, baby!\u2019\u201d\nHennessey sat on his son\u2019s bed and explained the harsh business of boxing. There were two options for Michael. He could keep fighting in his own gym and padding a winning record or he could go on the road and, amid the inevitable dodgy decisions and bruising defeats, he would learn how to fight. \u201cI took the road,\u201d Hennessy Jr told me.\nAged 15, Hennessy Jr was so smitten with boxing he asked his dad if they could move to Mexico so he could turn pro. He was in thrall to stories of great Mexican fighters becoming teenage professionals. His dad laughed and told him to keep working hard at school. Michael got five A*s and five As in his GSCEs.\nHennessy Jr smiled when I mentioned fight reports which described him as being \u201cangel-faced.\u201d He pointed out his old school preference for great fighters in Sugar Ray Leonard, James Toney, Arturo Gatti and Canelo Alv\u00e1rez. Chamberlain is also a boxing connoisseur and, that morning, we sat in the deserted lounge and watched videos on his phone of his favourite boxer. Joan Guzman, a former world champion super-bantamweight, was a slick stylist from the Dominican Republic. Guzman carried enough power to earn himself the name of \u201cLittle Tyson\u201d in the late 1990s but Chamberlain loved his fluid technique. He also showed me how Guzman used to leave his corner after the first bell and leap and twirl in the air before throwing a punch. \u201cI\u2019m gonna do that tonight,\u201d Chamberlain cackled. \u201cJust watch.\u201d\nThere was less frivolity at 6pm as Chamberlain and I sat on two wooden chairs in a Channel Five studio. A boxing ring was lit up by the surrounding huge screens which all carried the No 5 against a bright red backdrop. It was dark in our corner. Instead of thousands of people drinking and singing Sweet Caroline while the countdown to a night of boxing intensified, the TV studio was hushed and empty. \u201cThis is surreal,\u201d Chamberlain said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s making me have deep thoughts and powerful emotions. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m fighting again.\u201d\nI watched the Covid cleaning team chatting at ringside. Later, I learned that the four temporary cleaners, who sanitised the ring after every fight, were actually doctors. Sultan Hassan, who worked that night as a medic and a cleaner dressed in full PPE straight out of a sci-fi movie, sent me a tweet: \u201cThis would be the most qualified cleaning team comprising a consultant plastic surgeon, anaesthetist and two emergency/GP doctors. Well done Mick Hennessy for a well-organised show.\u201d By the time Hennessy Jr stepped into the ring, for the second bout of the night, and the fifth of his career, we had almost forgotten the Covid circumstances. Chamberlain\u2019s voice echoed above the fighters\u2019 gasps and grunts and the disconcerting thud of fists smacking into flesh and bone. Boxing seemed very raw as there was no crowd noise to disguise the sound of hurt.\n\u201cGood shot, bro,\u201d Chamberlain shouted to Hennessy. \u201cUse your feet. Hunt him down. That\u2019s great \u2026 feint to the body. Double jab, right hook, Yeah! Beautiful boxing, bro.\u201d\nBetween rounds, Chamberlain turned to me: \u201cThis is nerve-wracking, man!\u201d Even when Hennessy was pressured by his opponent, Tom Brennan, Chamberlain reassured him by shouting: \u201cHe\u2019s got nothing, Mike. Use that jab. Start flowing, bro!\u201d\nHennessy Jr won the fight on points and, with an hour left until he stepped into the ring, it was time for Chamberlain to retreat to the curtained area. His hands were wrapped in silence while we listened to the punches landing amid shouts from the two corners as the next fight began.\nIn an eerie blue light Chamberlain lay on the floor and began to stretch. It looked as if he was about to begin an elaborate dance routine as he rose to his haunches and extended his legs.\nLater, he stood patiently while Vaseline was applied to his eyebrows. His gloves were pulled on and then, with 20 minutes left, Chamberlain began to hit the pads held for him by his trainer.\nThe next call came. \u201cTen minutes to go \u2026\u201d Everything felt very serious. Chamberlain was concentrated and glistening as, with sighs and cries, he crashed punches into the shuddering mitts.\n\u201cFive minutes, gents,\u201d a Channel Five production man said as sweat flew across the tented room. Chamberlain offered his black glove so we could bump fists. It was a little good luck from me to a fighter who had been through so much.\n\u201cReady, lads?\u201d a voice shouted.\nChamberlain wore a shimmering black singlet and, across the back, those persuasive words were stitched in white: End Racism. I walked behind the fighter as he headed for the ring. There was a long pause when, close to the seats where we had watched Hennessy fight, Chamberlain waited. He watched his opponent enter the ring.\nFinally, the moment came. The sound of Clearly, a track by A2, an artist from east London, reverberated around the arena. Chamberlain was picked out by the television cameras as he walked across the vacant studio while A2\u2019s desolate words boomed. Without any fans it was like nothing I had seen in boxing. It was a fight for our Covid times.\nChamberlain kept his promise and did a leap and twirl in his corner, in honour of Guzman, after the opening bell.\nThe gulf in class was obvious even if it took two rounds for Chamberlain to shake off his ring rust against an aggressive Woolery. After a minute of round three, having repeatedly snapped his beautiful jab into Woolery\u2019s face, Chamberlain opened up. He speared heavy hooks into his rival\u2019s sagging frame. A vicious left hook to the body dropped Woolery. The referee stopped counting at seven. Chamberlain had won on a third-round knockout.\nHis next test will be in the ring a week on Saturday, again on Channel Five and in another bubble \u2013 with this fight in an empty television studio in Wakefield.\n\u201cIt felt like a fight,\u201d Chamberlain said in his dressing room. \u201cI was zoned in and didn\u2019t notice anything outside the ring. As soon as he stepped in I hit him with the jab. Boom. I kept thinking: \u2018Wait for him to come in and jab.\u2019 I wanted him to throw because I\u2019m very good with aggressive counters. His jab would come and I\u2019d change the angles. I was trying stuff I\u2019d learned these past 22 months. But I hit him and I hurt him. I then went bap, bap, bap to the head, to bring his hands up, and then, boom, back to the body!\u201d\nAfter Woolery visited Chamberlain\u2019s dressing room to pay his respects and ask for a photo, it felt calm. This is how boxing, and life, has to be for the foreseeable future. \u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d Chamberlain said, \u201cbut it\u2019s almost starting to feel normal. It might be in a bubble but the main thing, bro, is that I\u2019m definitely back.\u201d",

The player is understood to be relaxed about waiting until the last part of the window in October if necessary to ensure his departure from the club he first joined at the age of 12.\nEberechi Eze is set for a Palace medical on Thursday as the England Under-21 forward closes in on a move from Queens Park Rangers for an initial \u00a315m, while the club have also offered a contract to Ryan Fraser after he left Bournemouth and had a bid for Mainz striker Jean-Philippe Mateta rejected. The defender Nathan Ferguson has signed from West Brom but Zaha \u2013 who featured in Palace\u2019s first pre-season match against Oxford this week \u2013 still has his heart set on leaving for the second time having spent two years at Manchester United after a \u00a310m move in 2013.\n\u201cIf he feels he just does not want to be with us any more, that would be sad,\u201d Hodgson said in July. \u201cWe still like him very much; we can\u2019t make him like us. This is a situation that only he and the club can sort out.\u201d",

So at the last moment he had to be replaced by Eduardo Camavinga.\u201d\nAnother France international, Tottenham\u2019s Tanguy Ndombele, is also believed to have tested positive for coronavirus.\nAmong the other absentees with Pogba at the start of United\u2019s pre-season preparations will be Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who faces a 14-day quarantine after a holiday in Dubai.\nThe Guardian has contacted the club to clarify whether Wan-Bissaka had permission to travel to Dubai and whether, even though the bulk of the squad are expected back on Wednesday, the defender was among those given extra time to recuperate after last season.\nWan-Bissaka has posted pictures of himself undergoing fitness sessions in Dubai, which is on the list of places from which people returning to the UK have to self-isolate for 14 days.\nDubai was on that list before United\u2019s final match, the Europa League semi-final defeat by Sevilla on 16 August.\nOle Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has encouraged his players to take as refreshing a break as possible given United\u2019s 2019-20 season was a year and a week long because of coronavirus.

He strongly denies wrongdoing and has appealed, which will lead to a retrial before a higher court. Under Greek law a conviction remains pending once an appeal process is launched.\nMarcus Rashford is expected to pull out of the matches against Iceland and Denmark in early September when he reports to Gareth Southgate\u2019s England squad next week due to an ankle problem.

        "content": "Leading scientist calls for findings of rapid finger pricktest research to be made public\nClaims that a rapid Covid-19 antibody test the government hopes to roll out this year is more than 99% accurate cannot be trusted, says a leading expert, calling for the full trial data to be made public.\nJon Deeks, a professor of biostatistics and head of the test evaluation research group at the University of Birmingham, says the data published by Abingdon Health about the performance of its fingerprick antibody test were inadequate. The government hopes to roll out the test to millions of people.\nWriting for the Guardian, Deeks calls for the company to publish its data in full in the interests of transparency. \u201cSecrecy destroys trust. Restoring scientific credibility will require urgent publication of the protocols and reports for these studies.\u201d\nOther established British companies say they have antibody tests validated as being high quality by UK universities that they are selling around the world, but complain that they cannot get UK government approval.\nMinisters and their advisers appear focused on the Abingdon Health test. The company heads a consortium asked to design a rapid antibody test by Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, who is the government\u2019s main adviser on tests.\nThe other partners in the UK-rapid test consortium (UK-RTC) are Oxford University, BBI Solutions, CIGA Healthcare and Omega Diagnostics.\nBell, who has called the AbC-19 test \u201ctruly amazing\u201d, assessed a range of other antibody tests bought by Matt Hancock, the health secretary, in March and rejected them all as inadequate. They were mostly made by Chinese companies. The drive since has been to get a British test.\nIn a leak to the Telegraph in July, it was claimed that Abingdon Health and partners had carried out \u201csuccessful secret tests\u201d. It said the British government \u201cplans to distribute millions of free coronavirus antibody tests\u201d as a result. Ministers were said to be hoping to use the test in a \u201cmass screening programme before the end of the year\u201d.\nWhile the test is currently \u201cpoint of care\u201d \u2013 meaning a medical practitioner does the fingerprick in a clinic or at home \u2013 Abingdon Health is thought to be preparing a dossier to get it approved as a self-test that anyone could use.\nThe UK regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, has set a bar of 98% accuracy for self-tests. Abingdon Health says its test is 99.4% accurate.\nHowever, Deeks says that statement cannotbe trusted without the full data to support it. Deeks has previously shown how companies making tests could \u201cgame\u201d the data in their trials, for instance by selecting blood samples from people with high levels of antibodies.\nAccording to the limited trial data available from Abingdon Health, blood samples were excluded if a lab-based Elisa test called EuroImmun did not detect Covid-19 antibodies. EuroImmun is well known to be a poor test. Public Health England says it misses 28% of positive cases because it only picks up high antibody levels, not low ones.\nDeeks says it is possible that up to 79 true Covid-19 cases could have been excluded from the trial, which included 203 Covid-19 samples and 450 non-Covid-19 samples. He calls for scientifically rigorous and trustworthy studies and says the current regulations \u201cfail to protect the public from the harm that can be caused by poor, inadequately evaluated tests\u201d.\nAbingdon Health said: \u201cIt would be inaccurate to suggest our numbers are lower than we\u2019ve stated. Based on independent study by Ulster University our tests are 99.40% accurate, with a sensitivity of 98.03%.\u201d Further results would be published shortly, it said.\nBell told the Guardian he had not seen the latest trial data from Abingdon Health or played any part in its validation. What he had seen of the test results \u201cwere as good or better than anything we\u2019d seen before and all these other tests, and it was made in the UK, which means there will be security of supply,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a good test.\u201d\nBut he supported Deeks\u2019s call for transparency. \u201cAt some level I\u2019m sympathetic to Jon Deeks because it is true that not all the validations in this space have been made transparently accessible for people to look at and say that looks OK and that doesn\u2019t look OK,\u201d he said.",

        "content": "Jessie Buckley is a troubled young woman on the brink of breaking up with her boyfriend in this surreal, disquieting and sometimes extraordinary drama\nWith his new film, Charlie Kaufman again proves that if you want something to make you feel trapped in a terrifying claustrophobic nightmare for ever and ever ... well, he\u2019s your guy. His latest movie is about a student, played by Jessie Buckley, who for six weeks has been dating a dullish man called Jake (Jesse Plemons) for reasons that that she can\u2019t put her finger on. She is now going to meet his parents, an important next step that she has sleepwalked into, like everything else in their relationship.\nIt means a long, uncomfortable, cold drive out to these old folks\u2019 creepy farm in the countryside \u2013 just at the moment when she realises that she maybe wants to end things with Jake, which gives her an anti-epiphany about her life and his. (\u201cI\u2019ve never mentioned Jake to my parents and I guess I never will,\u201d she murmurs silently.)\nShe has a clear, dispassionate glimpse of someone whose existence she really isn\u2019t committed to and also of their supposed future lives together: a pointless, arbitrary entanglement, like all coupledom. A warning and despairing voice whispers in her head that all this is pointless but also breaking up could be pointless, too. Should she be ending things in a more radical way? Soon she is to be vouchsafed a haunting vision of the things that are important to poor, boring Jake \u2013 his mum and dad (wonderfully played by Toni Collette and David Thewlis), a local ice-cream store and his high school, whose sad old janitor (Guy Boyd) haunts this movie\u2019s dreams.\nI\u2019m Thinking of Ending Things is adapted by Kaufman from the novel by Canadian author Iain Reid and it\u2019s really scary in a way that conventional scary movies really aren\u2019t scary: insidiously disquieting and yet also somehow poignant and sad, a secondary mood that finally, inexplicably emerges from an unending rhapsody of directionless weirdness. Who is this woman? Who is Jake? Who is the janitor? It\u2019s an arresting drama, although I was sorry that straight-up comedy (which Kaufman can really do) played little part.\nThis film happens to be coming out right on top of Kaufman\u2019s other new work \u2013 an epically bizarre autofictional novel called Antkind \u2013 and there are points in common, namely, Kaufman\u2019s extraordinary, compulsive way of creating an alternative world of loneliness and sadness, accumulating tension and anxiety and suppressed panic minute by minute. You can spend up to an hour wondering uneasily when this film is going to start, while also realising that you have been on the edge of your seat.\nAs ever, Kaufman shores up his world with pop-culture fragments. Real people get roped in. He has a digression-daydream featuring a made-up romcom directed by Robert Zemeckis. Are we supposed to look down on Zemeckis, therefore? Not necessarily. The couple\u2019s road trip also features a long and rather bad-tempered discussion of the film A Woman Under the Influence by John Cassavetes, although the directors that have surely influenced I\u2019m Thinking of Ending Things, such as Bu\u00f1uel and Lynch, go unmentioned.\nThe centre of the horror is that farm, stark and cold, where Colette and Thewlis\u2019s strange pair host a decidedly unrelaxed supper party for the unhappy couple. As their appearance starts changing, with the furnishings and photos changing, too, Buckley starts politely asking Jake if they can go home now, and Kaufman demonstrates his unearthly skill in creating scenarios like lucid dreams. Molly Hughes\u2019s production design and \u0141ukasz \u017bal\u2019s cinematography are also vital in fabricating this world.\nAnd what does it all mean? Kaufman is content to swirl away from actual revelations, but his evocation of high-school life occupies the position where in any other kind of fiction an explanation might go. It is a place where Jake seems to have picked up an uncool fondness for musicals and Broadway show tunes, and Kaufman imagines a kind of fantasy dance sequence for Jake and his new girlfriend in the corridors of the school. But perhaps it is more that for many (or maybe even everyone) high school felt shatteringly real in a way that nothing else would, and success there really does feel as good as winning the Nobel prize. Not that Jake has ever achieved anything of the sort, then or now.\nPlemons stolidly occupies the role of Jake \u2013 it is the kind of role that the late Philip Seymour Hoffman (star of Kaufman\u2019s masterpiece, Synecdoche, New York) might also have played. And Buckley is impeccably cast as the young woman adrift in a bad dream someone else is having.\n I\u2019m Thinking of Ending Things is on Netflix from 4 September",

Growth, which averaged 5% in 2019, was likely to come to a standstill this year, the IMF said, adding that previous pandemics had left permanent scars.\nIt backed a recent call from the World Bank president, David Malpass, for a more ambitious programme of debt relief that would move beyond repayment holidays to a reduction in the stock of debt.\n\u201cLIDCs entered the Covid-19 crisis in an already vulnerable position \u2013 for example, half of them suffered high public debt levels,\u201d the IMF said. \u201cSince March, LIDCs have been hit by an exceptional confluence of external shocks: a sharp contraction in real exports, lower export prices, especially for oil, less capital and remittances inflows, and reduced tourism receipts.\n\u201cDespite the best efforts of LIDC governments, lasting damage seems unavoidable in the absence of more international support. Long-term \u2018scarring\u2019 \u2013 the permanent loss of productive capacity \u2013 is a particularly worrisome prospect.\u201d\nScarring from past pandemics had included high death rates, worse health and education outcomes leading to weaker future earnings; a depletion in savings and assets that result in the closure of firms; and a legacy of debt that depressed lending to the private sector. The IMF said that in the aftermath of the 2013 Ebola outreak, Sierra Leone never recovered to its pre-crisis growth path.\n\u201cScarring would trigger severe setbacks to LIDCs\u2019 development efforts, including undoing the gains in reducing poverty over the last seven to 10 years, and exacerbating inequality, including gender inequality,\u201d the IMF said.\nThe UN has set a number of ambitious sustainable development goals to be met by 2030, and the IMF said scarring would make these more difficult to achieve.\nThe IMF has provided emergency financial help to 42 of the LIDCs during the coronavirus crisis but said more was needed. It said the priorities were:\nGuaranteeing essential health supplies, including cures and vaccines when they are discovered.\nProtecting critical supply chains, especially for food and medicines.\nAvoiding protectionism.\nEnsuring developing economies can finance critical spending through grants and concessional financing.\nEnsuring LIDCs\u2019 international liquidity needs are met, which requires institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank to be resourced adequately.\nReprofiling and restructuring debt to restore sustainability where needed, which, in many cases, could require more generous relief than offered by the G20 in the spring.\nKeeping sight of the UN\u2019s 2030 sustainable development goals, including by reassessing needs when the crisis subsides.\n\u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic will be defeated only when it and its socioeconomic consequences are overcome everywhere. Urgent action by the international community can save lives and livelihoods in LIDCs,\u201d the IMF said.",

        "content": "A former FBI agent has documented links between serving officers and racist militant activities in more than a dozen states\nWhite supremacist groups have infiltrated US law enforcement agencies in every region of the country over the last two decades, according to a new report about the ties between police and far-right vigilante groups.\nIn a timely new analysis, Michael German, a former FBI special agent who has written extensively on the ways that US law enforcement have failed to respond to far-right domestic terror threats, concludes that US law enforcement officials have been tied to racist militant activities in more than a dozen states since 2000, and hundreds of police officers have been caught posting racist and bigoted social media content.\nThe report notes that over the years, police links to militias and white supremacist groups have been uncovered in states including Alabama, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Virginia, Washington and West Virginia.\nPolice in Sacramento, California, in 2018 worked with neo-Nazis to pursue charges against anti-racist activists, including some who had been stabbed, according to records.\nAnd just this summer, German writes, an Orange county sheriff\u2019s deputy and a Chicago policeman were caught wearing far-right militia logos; an Olympia, Washington, officer was photographed posing with a militia group; and Philadelphia police officers were filmed standing by while armed mobs attacked protesters and journalists.\nThe exact scale of ties between law enforcement and militias is hard to determine, German told the Guardian. \u201cNobody is collecting the data and nobody is actively looking for these law enforcement officers,\u201d he said.\nOfficers\u2019 racist activities are often known within their departments and generally result in punishment or termination following public scandals, the report notes. Few police agencies have explicit policies against affiliating with white supremacist groups. If police officers are disciplined, the measures often lead to protracted litigation.\nConcerns about alleged relations between far-right groups and law enforcement in the US have intensified since the start of the protest movement sparked by the police killing of George Floyd. Police in states including California, Oregon, Illinois and Washington are now facing investigations for their alleged affinity to far-right groups opposing Black Lives Matter, according to the report.\nThis week, police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, faced intense scrutiny over their response to armed white men and militia groups gathered in the city amid demonstrations by Black Lives Matter activists and others over the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black father of three who was left paralyzed after being shot in the back. On Wednesday, Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old who appeared to consider himself a militia member and had posted \u201cblue lives matter\u201d content, was arrested on suspicion of murder after the fatal shooting of two protesters.\nActivists in Kenosha say police there have responded aggressively and violently to Black Lives Matter demonstrators, while doing little to stop armed white vigilantes. Supporting their claims is at least one video taken before the shooting that showed police tossing bottled water to what appeared to be armed civilians, including one who appeared to be the shooter, the AP noted: \u201cWe appreciate you being here,\u201d an officer said on loudspeaker.\nPolice also reportedly let the gunman walk past them with a rifle as the crowd yelled for him to be arrested because he had shot people, according to witnesses and video reviewed by the news agency.\nThe Kenosha sheriff, David Beth, has said the incident was chaotic and stressful.\nGerman told the Guardian on Wednesday: \u201cFar-right militants are allowed to engage in violence and walk away while protesters are met with violent police actions.\u201d This \u201cnegligent response\u201d, he added, empowers violent groups in dangerous and potentially lethal ways: \u201cThe most violent elements within these far-right militant groups believe that their conduct is sanctioned by the government. And therefore they\u2019re much more willing to come out and engage in acts of violence against protesters.\u201d\nThere is growing awareness in some parts of the government about the intensifying threat of white supremacy. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have directly identified white supremacists as the most lethal domestic terrorist threat in the country. According to German\u2019s report, the FBI\u2019s own internal documents have directly warned that the militia groups the agency is investigating often have \u201cactive links\u201d to law enforcement.\nAnd yet US agencies lack a national strategy to identify white supremacist police and root out this problem, German warned. Meanwhile, popular police reform efforts to address \u201cimplicit bias\u201d have done nothing to confront explicit racism.\nThe FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nAs the calls to defund police have grown in recent months, law enforcement alignment with violent and racist groups only adds further fuel to the movement, German said. \u201cIn a time when the effort to defund police is getting some salience, the police are behaving in such a way as to justify that argument.\u201d",

For that, a foghorn is needed.\nEnter Yair Netanyahu, the leader\u2019s 29-year-old son. He has increasingly emerged as his father\u2019s attack dog, defending the prime minister as he faces relentless protests and widespread public anger over his government\u2019s handling of the country\u2019s coronavirus crisis and charges of alleged corruption.\nWhile the older Netanyahu has branded the protesters as anarchic leftists intent on violence, Yair has gone further in dismissing them, describing how his father has laughed at the demonstrators.\n\u201cIt amuses him ... It\u2019s like a kind of entertainment,\u201d he told the Galei Yisrael radio station. \u201cIt entertains him. It even gives him a bit of strength.\u201d\nThe father-son duo has emerged as a useful tool for world leaders. Without the shackles of expected decency associated with high office, children can act as unfiltered proxies for their powerful parents, spreading what is interpreted as the raw truths of their fathers\u2019 message, even if they do not officially speak on their behalf.\nYair is not alone in his role. Donald Trump Jr has fought some of the dirtiest fights for his father, mostly recently by falsely insinuating that the US Democrat presidential candidate, Joe Biden, was a child sex abuser. Meanwhile, in Brazil, Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, suggested hardline dictatorship-era tactics would be needed to crush leftist opponents.\nIn Israel, Yair has long had a reputation for trolling his parents\u2019 enemies and rousing hatred online. In 2018, he was temporarily banned from Facebook after writing that he would prefer all Muslims to leave the country. In April, he called for a \u201cfree, democratic and Christian\u201d Europe to replace the EU.\nBut the recent demonstrations have given him new vigour and prominence, especially on his Twitter account, which has more than 90,000 followers and is picked up daily by the Hebrew-language press.\nEarlier this month, an Israeli court ordered him to take down a tweet that showed the names, home addresses and mobile phone numbers of three prominent protesters.\n\u201cI invite everyone to come to protest, day and night \u2026 at the homes of these people who have been organising the anarchy in the country for all of us in recent weeks,\u201d he had said. The protesters said they had received threatening calls after the tweet was sent out.\nAt other times, his posts have been dismissed or laughed off. However, with unemployment soaring above 20%, and with resurgent coronavirus infections severely threatening people\u2019s livelihoods, his comments about the demonstrators have touched a nerve.\nWriting in the left-leaning Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Tchia Dov, slammed the \u201ccrown prince\u201d and \u201cspoiled playboy\u201d as enjoying ice cream and laughing at home with his dad about the protesters.\n\u201cStudents who have lost the jobs that helped them pay tuition, people who can\u2019t pay their home mortgages, who won\u2019t be able to pay for daycare and preschool \u2013 that\u2019s all a joke. People in the entertainment industry who haven\u2019t earned a cent in months, banquet hall owners, grounded pilots and crew \u2013 all are in effect a cause for laughter for the royal family,\u201d she wrote.\nIn the country\u2019s top-selling Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, another writer, Raanan Shaked, accused Netanyahu of spreading hatred and division among Israelis and then mocking them.\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t here for your personal entertainment. We live here. We\u2019re Israelis,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cWe come seeking peace. But if that\u2019s currently unavailable, we\u2019d be glad to take healthcare, welfare, a functioning economy, overcoming the coronavirus crisis and, more than anything, reconciliation.\u201d\nIn a statement sent to the Guardian, a Netanyahu family spokesperson said Yair did not speak on behalf of his father. \u201cThe things he writes and says are on his mind and represent his positions.\u201d\nIt rejected claims that Yair had \u201cnullified the legitimacy\u201d of the protests, adding he believed in the right to demonstrate. However, the statement complained of what it said were death threats towards the prime minister, allegations of violence against police by demonstrators as well as claims of protesters ignoring social distancing rules, which it said created a \u201ccorona hatchery\u201d.\n\u201cThen it turns from a legitimate protest into anarchy.\u201d",

But it has worked in the past\nThis week Letetra Wildman, the sister of Jacob Blake, delivered a gripping message: \u201cI don\u2019t want your pity, I want change\u201d.\nApparently, the NBA received her memo.\nIt all started with the news on Wednesday that the Milwaukee Bucks decided to boycott their playoff game after Blake, a Black man, was shot seven times in the back by a white police officer in the team\u2019s home state of Wisconsin. Soon, the NBA cancelled the rest of Wednesday\u2019s playoff games and leagues such as the WNBA, MLB and MLS followed suit.\nOn television, former player Chris Webber delivered an emotional address as he fought back tears: \u201cWe understand it\u2019s not going to end. But that does not mean young men that you don\u2019t do anything. Don\u2019t listen to these people telling you don\u2019t do anything because it\u2019s not going to end right away.\u201d\nEveryone has weighed in with their opinions since the Bucks announced their boycott. Many questioned whether a boycott can really change the inequality and racism at the heart of America. Or what refusing to play basketball has to do with Jacob Blake or George Floyd or Breonna Taylor or any of the other countless Black men and Black women who have been unjustly injured or killed by the police with no accountability.\nI\u2019m glad you asked. In July, I wrote an article detailing how much power NBA teams \u2013 and their billionaire CEOs \u2013 wield in the cities where they play. Money talks and it is well known that lost revenue has a way of motivating organizations to action at lightning speeds. Although teams are currently playing in a socially isolated bubble in Florida, people in their home bases will have seen players \u2013 and some CEOs \u2013 are willing to take action on racial injustice. If, in the future, a team threatened to leave a city if nothing is done on, say, police reform, civic leaders may well listen.\nIt has worked before. What the NBA and WNBA are doing now is monumental and they follow the tradition of athlete activists who have utilized the art of the boycott as a way to not only make a statement, but to push for real tangible change. A case in point: the great Elgin Baylor\nDuring his first season in the NBA in 1959, the Hall of Famer\u2019s Lakers team were scheduled to play a neutral-site game in Charleston, West Virginia, against the Cincinnati Royals. When the Lakers arrived at their hotel, the clerk looked at the team and said: \u201cThe three colored boys [Baylor and his Black teammates Boo Ellis and Ed Fleming] will have to go somewhere else: This is a nice, respectable hotel. We can\u2019t take the colored boys.\u201d\nBaylor, Ellis and Fleming ended up staying in an all-Black hotel but he had had enough. He decided to boycott the game, telling his white teammate, and Charleston native, Rod Hundley: \u201cRod, I\u2019m a human being, I\u2019m not an animal put in a cage and let out for the show.\u201d\nBaylor\u2019s decision was important because it hit the pockets of the rich and powerful in Charleston. The game had been sponsored by the the American Business Club of Charleston, which paid $6,500 (around $57,000 in today\u2019s money) for the privilege. They also, damningly, knew in advance that Baylor and his Black teammates would not be allowed to stay with their white teammates and had done nothing to change things, despite the power they wielded in the city.\nSuddenly, those rich, white businessman had paid to sponsor a game in which the league\u2019s best young player would not even play. The club later sent a telegram to the NBA complaining that the incident had been \u201cmost embarrassing to us\u201d.\nShortly after Baylor\u2019s boycott, NBA commissioner Maurice Podoloff promised to make sure such treatment of Black players at hotels would be a thing of the past when they were representing the league.\nLater, Baylor would meet with Lakers CEO Bob Short and that too led to meaningful change. \u201c[Baylor\u2019s] refusal to play was a matter of principle with him,\u201d said Short, \u201cand I\u2019m certainly not going to fault him for that ... We will demand a non-segregation clause in future contracts.\u201d\nBaylor gave us a blueprint for how current NBA players can employ boycotts as a method to force NBA CEOs to use their power and influence to truly bring about change. Imagine those in the 50s who criticized Elgin Baylor. Who said that he was overstating his importance and his power. His courage to hurt powerful figures in a segregated city caused the NBA and the Lakers to change the way they treated their Black players. The likes of LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo can effect similar change now. All they have to do is demand it.\nEtan Thomas played in the NBA from 2001 through 2011.

Boris Johnson was urged to do more to get a grip on factory outbreaks.\nThe Banham Poultry site, about 15 miles south-west of Norwich, had been partially closed and all staff who worked on its cutting floor sent home, local health officials said.\nThe prime minister assured MPs in June that the government was taking the prevalence of outbreaks in meat processing plants seriously. However, when asked last week, Whitehall officials were not able to produce any data that even measured the scale of the problem.\nOn Wednesday, the chief operating officer of the Food Standards Agency reportedly said it was looking at about 40 outbreaks in factories in England. According to the industry magazine Food Manufacture, Dr Colin Sullivan acknowledged there was evidence of increased prevalence but he admitted he did not have reliable data to hand.\nResponding to the announcement about the partial closure of the Banham site on Thursday, the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: \u201cThis is more evidence that Boris Johnson\u2019s test-and-tracing system simply isn\u2019t \u2018world-beating\u2019, as promised.\n\u201cIt is vital detailed data is collected when testing and tracing, including place of work, so hotspots can be quickly identified and decisive action taken \u2013 including temporarily closing factories where necessary \u2013 by local public health officials.\u201d\nNorfolk officials declared the Banham outbreak on Tuesday, saying at that point that seven positive tests had been returned. That was increased to 46 the next day and 75 on Thursday as more test results came in.\nNorfolk county council said: \u201cAs a result of this infection rate, which is at about 22%, Banham Poultry has voluntarily agreed to close part of their site following advice from Public Health England and Norfolk Public Health.\n\u201cThose who have tested positive will be asked to isolate for 10 days. Those who have tested negative will be asked to isolate for 14 days.\u201d\nParts of the factory remained open, with staff in those areas told to continue working, but their numbers are not known.\nNorfolk\u2019s director of public health, Dr Louise Smith, said: \u201cThis action has been taken because we believe it is the most effective way to protect the wider public from further transmission ... There is no evidence of increased risk to the general public. The risk of infection from food products is very low.\u201d\nThe Banham case is the latest in a string of outbreaks in food processing plants around the country. Last week, a Guardian analysis found at least 1,454 confirmed infections linked to such sites across England, Scotland and Wales, including several in recent weeks. More were expected to have occurred in Northern Ireland, but authorities there will not publish specific statistics.\nJohnson told the Commons about two months ago: \u201cWe will certainly look into what is happening to meat processing ... We need to get to the bottom of what is happening.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cCurrently, two theories have been advanced to me: one is about the cold environment in the plants, which may be propitious to the virus, and the other is the possibility that staff are congregating in such a way as to spread the virus. We do not know what it is, but we are investigating.\u201d\nBanham Poultry has been approached for comment.",

On Tuesday Briatore was confirmed to have tested positive for Covid-19 after being admitted to hospital in Milan, according to a statement from his staff.\nOfficials are now facing the challenge of contacting everyone who has been at the club in recent weeks.\nMarcello Acciaro, the director of an anti-Covid unit in northern Sardinia, has made an official request for the names of the club\u2019s visitors, which it has to record under Italian regulations. \u201cThat register will prove very useful in order to trace the whereabouts of anyone who frequented the nightclub,\u201d he told the Corriere della Sera.\nItalian media reports, suggest Billionaire welcomed between 8,000 and 11,000 guests in the first weeks of August, and authorities fear many registered with false names or phone numbers.\nNew cases of Covid-19 have increased rapidly in Italy in recent days. The country reported 1,367 new cases on Wednesday, its highest daily tally since May when the country was still under lockdown. Half of the new cases in the Lazio region have been traced to holidaymakers returning from Sardinia, some of whom frequented Billionaire.\nBriatore harshly criticised the Italian government in mid-August when it ordered the closure of all nightclubs. \u201cThis new decree was written by a madman,\u201d he said at the time.\nThe businessman has said he was taken to hospital because of an inflammation of the prostate and was given a coronavirus test while there.\nHe has also been forced to close his Cipriani restaurant in Montecarlo after two members of staff tested positive for Covid-19.\nThe Bologna coach, Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107, who socialised with Briatore in Sardinia, has also tested positive for coronavirus.\nBriatore also met the former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi at his compound on Sardinia\u2019s Emerald Coast in August. \u201cI came to visit my friend, the president: I love him so much and find him in good shape. Bravo Silvio,\u201d Briatore said in a short video posted on Instagram.\nBerlusconi said this week he had taken a test and did not have Covid-19.\nSardinia was one of the Italian regions least affected by the epidemic.

The amounts equate to about a fifth of the median weekly wage in Greater Manchester, where part of the trial is being held.\nThe move follows weeks of campaigning by regional mayors, councils and trade unions who said millions of people across the country could not afford to isolate without pay for a fortnight.\nWorkers will have to show proof of employment or self-employment, be unable to work from home, and be receiving universal credit or working tax credit in order to be eligible for the scheme.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said stringent checks would be carried out on people to prevent fraud, and the payments would aim to be made within 48 hours of evidence being provided.\nMatt Hancock, the health secretary, said the amount was based on statutory sick pay (SSP) of \u00a395.85 a week, but it was roundly criticised as going \u201cnowhere near far enough\u201d.\nThere are an estimated 300,000 people in Greater Manchester who may not be able to afford to self-isolate, including self-employed people and 90,000 workers who do not qualify for SSP because their incomes are too low. These include hospital porters, cleaners, warehouse workers and hospitality staff.\nProf Susan Michie, the director of the Centre for Behaviour Change at University College London and a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours, a government advisory group, said the payments were not enough and should not be limited to people living in areas with high infection rates. \u201cThis is a question of guaranteeing no financial loss,\u201d she said.\nStephen Reicher, another member of the Sage subcommittee on behavioural science, described the scheme as \u201cwoefully inadequate in multiple ways\u201d, adding that the financial support should be increased and expanded across England.\nMohammed Iqbal, the leader of Pendle borough council, one of the areas where the scheme is being trialled, said: \u201cI welcome the fact that there is a financial package in place but the figures that the government has introduced are really a slap in the face for those people who sadly test positive.\u201d\nDominic Harrison, the director of public health at Blackburn with Darwen council, said the self-isolation payments should be equivalent to the jury service fee of \u00a364.95 a day.\nSteve Rotheram, the mayor of the Liverpool city region, said the figure \u201cfalls far below what people need\u201d and would force people to \u201cchoose between putting food on the table or keeping their communities safe\u201d. He said people should be able to claim back any lost wages from the government.\nHancock told Times Radio the scheme was \u201cthe first step in paying people to self-isolate\u201d and suggested the payment could be raised if the trial were expanded.\nJim McMahon, the Labour MP for Oldham West and Royton, said it was nowhere near enough to replace the lost income of people such as taxi drivers, warehouse workers, delivery drivers and security operators who would face a choice between self-isolating without pay or providing for their families.\nAndy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, who led calls for low-paid workers to be paid their full normal wage for the quarantine period, said he was pleased ministers had acknowledged the issue but the scheme it went \u201cnowhere near far enough\u201d and would \u201cleave people without enough to live on\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cThe health secretary has already said that he couldn\u2019t live on statutory sick pay at \u00a395 a week.

It is chaired by Lord Faulks, a former Conservative justice minister who is now sits in the upper house as an independent. Among other legal experts on the panel are Prof Alan Page, a constitutional specialist who is an adviser to the Scottish parliament.\nIn his letter to Cherry, the justice secretary wrote that the review would examine \u201cthe balance of the interest of the citizen being able to challenge the lawfulness of executive action through the courts with the importance of the executive being able to govern effectively under the law\u201d.\nIn her reply, Cherry said: \u201cThe authority and privileges of the court of session including its inherent supervisory jurisdiction are protected by article 19 of the Acts of Union and the underlying treaty of union. The scope of the review also raises serious questions for the rule of law which will be of concern across the United Kingdom.\u201d\nThe Acts of Union were passed in 1706 and 1707 in both the Scottish and English parliaments.\n Jolyon Maugham QC, the founder of the Good Law Project who brought judicial review challenges in the prorogation case in the Scottish courts, supports Cherry\u2019s concerns.\nHe said: \u201cLegislation to narrow the jurisdiction or powers of Scotland\u2019s court of session would likely offend against article 19 of the Acts of Union which guarantees for all time \u201cthe same authority and privileges\u201d as before the union.\n\u201cIt would be punchy of Westminster to rewrite that ancient constitutional settlement and undermine Scotland\u2019s separate legal system at a moment when Brexit had already generated majority support for Scottish independence.\u201d\nHe suggested that if on the other hand the Scottish legal system was left unaltered and restrictive judicial review regulations introduced into England and Wales, it could result in some challenges moving from London to the Edinburgh courts.\nA Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \u201cJudicial review is an essential part of our democracy. The independent panel will ensure this important check on government power is maintained, while making sure the process is not open to abuse and delay.\n\u201cThe Scottish legal system has been distinct but entwined with the English and Welsh system for over 300 years and this panel has no intention of changing that.\n\u201cNonetheless, we have appointed an esteemed Scottish law academic to the panel to assess whether any changes might impact Scotland.\u201d",

        "content": "Melanie Wolfson was asked to move twice because men refused to sit next to a female \nA British-Israeli woman is suing easyJet after the low-cost airline asked her to move seats on a flight from Tel Aviv to London following objections from ultra-Orthodox Jewish men who refused to sit next to a female passenger.\nMelanie Wolfson, 38, is claiming 66,438 shekels (almost \u00a315,000) compensation in a lawsuit filed on her behalf by the Israel Religious Action Center (IRAC), which won a similar case in 2017 brought against El Al, the Israeli national carrier.\nWolfson, a professional fundraiser who moved to Israel 13 years ago and lives in Tel Aviv, is also asking that easyJet bans its cabin crew from asking women to switch seats because of their gender.\nAccording to the lawsuit, Wolfson paid extra for an aisle seat on her flight last October. An ultra-Orthodox man and his son, who were sitting in the row when she arrived, asked Wolfson to switch seats with a man a few rows ahead.\nWolfson says she was \u201cinsulted and humiliated\u201d by the request. \u201cIt was the first time in my adult life that I was discriminated against for being a woman,\u201d she told Haaretz.\n\u201cI would not have had any problem whatsoever switching seats if it were to allow members of a family or friends to sit together, but the fact that I was being asked to do this because I was a woman was why I refused.\u201d\nA flight attendant intervened and offered Wolfson a free hot drink as an incentive to move. Concerned that the flight might be delayed on her account and feeling that she had little choice in the matter, she agreed to switch seats. \u201cThere were passengers watching this happen who said nothing,\u201d she said.\nAccording to the suit, several flight attendants told Wolfson during the flight that women were often asked to switch seats in order to accommodate ultra-Orthodox men.\nTwo months later, on another easyJet flight to London, Wolfson was again asked to move seats by two ultra-Orthodox men. She refused their request but two female passengers agreed to change seats with the two men sitting next to her.\nMembers of the cabin crew did not intervene or try to defend her right to stay seated where she was although again she was offered a free hot drink, according to the suit.\nWolfson complained to the airline on both occasions but when it failed to respond, she decided to sue for violation of Israeli law, which prohibits discrimination against customers on the basis of race, religion, nationality, land of origin, gender, sexual orientation, political views or personal status.\nAlthough easyJet is not based in Israel, lawyers will argue that the airline was subject to Israeli law while its plane was on the ground at Ben-Gurion airport, where the incident took place.\nIn a statement, easyJet said: \u201cWe take claims of this nature very seriously. Whilst it would be inappropriate to comment, as this matter is currently the subject of legal proceedings, we do not discriminate on any grounds.\u201d\nThree years ago, Renee Rabinowitz, an 82-year-old Holocaust survivor, won a landmark ruling against El Al. The Israeli judge hearing the case said that \u201cunder absolutely no circumstances can a crew member ask a passenger to move from their designated seat because the adjacent passenger doesn\u2019t want to sit next to them due to their gender\u201d.\nAt the time, IRAC said almost 7,500 emails had been sent to El Al by members of the public objecting to requests made to female passengers to change seats.\n This article was amended on 28 August 2020 to restore the wording \u201cultra-Orthodox\u201d, which had been mistakenly changed during the editing process.",

        "content": "Lewis Hamilton will compete at the Belgian Grand Prix this weekend after speculation he could withdraw in protest at the police shooting of Jacob Blake in the US.\nHamilton is the only black driver in Formula One and has been forthright in urging the sport to adopt an anti-racist stance and in his support of the Black Lives Matter movement. However, despite widespread boycotts in US sports over the Wisconsin shooting, the British driver has chosen to take part in the race believing his withdrawal would have little effect on the situation in the US.\nDuring their briefing on Friday the drivers will have a discussion on what action they might take but, speaking before the Belgian GP, Hamilton had decided that despite his huge global appeal his withdrawal would not be effective.\n\u201cSo many people are standing with the players and pushing for change it\u2019s a shame that\u2019s what\u2019s needed over there in order to get a reaction,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that is in America and I don\u2019t know if me doing anything here will particularly have any effect. We are in Belgium not in the United States.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to anybody about it but I am really proud of so many of them out there. I stand unified with them trying to do what I can over here. I don\u2019t know how us not doing the race, it [racism] will still go on is the thing. I will try to speak to F1 to see what else we can do to continue to raise awareness.\u201d\nIn the wake of the shooting of Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, 40 miles from Milwaukee, a number of sporting events were called off and the Black tennis player Naomi Osaka withdrew from her semi-final in the Western & Southern Open in protest. Thursday\u2019s matches at the tournament, taking place in New York as the precursor to the US Open, were suspended.\nOsaka had tweeted that she felt as a Black woman compelled to pull out of the tournament to put a focus on police shooting Black people. She was supported by other players on the WTA tour. Hamilton reposted her withdrawal message on Instagram with the words \u201cI am so proud of you\u201d. She has since agreed to play in Friday\u2019s rearranged matches.\nOn Wednesday the Milwaukee Bucks had boycotted their play-off game against the Orlando Magic and subsequently all that evening\u2019s NBA and WNBA games were called off although the NBA play-offs are expected to resume. With athletes demanding racial justice three Major League Baseball games and five of six Major League Soccer games were also called off.\nEvery event in F1 counts towards the title and choosing not to race would have had an impact on Hamilton\u2019s attempt to secure his seventh world championship. He has won four of the six races so far and enjoys a comfortable lead. He is 37 points in front of Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen and 43 clear of his teammate Valtteri Bottas. However either driver could have closed the gap with a 25-point swing if Hamilton had not taken part and they won this weekend.\nHamilton has vigorously committed to the anti-racist cause since the killing of George Floyd. He has led F1 in committing to anti-racism statements and gestures before races, taking the knee alongside the majority of fellow drivers at all the meetings thus far. He has repeatedly called for the sport, its teams and drivers to embrace anti-racism. In July after he won the Styrian GP Hamilton gave the Black power salute on the podium and made a clear statement of the seriousness of his commitment afterwards.\n\u201cRacism is going to be here for longer than our time here,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of work needs to go on in F1, the FIA need to be part of it, the drivers need to be a part of it. We are going to be fighting and pushing for it all year. For me this is going to be a lifelong thing.\u201d\nRenault\u2019s Daniel Ricciardo, a prominent supporter of anti-racism, confirmed he believed the sport should act collectively in response to the shooting.\n\u201cUntil there is a change you keep banging on the door until it falls down,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen is it enough? You shake your head in disbelief how it can keep going on, it still blows my mind. If there is something we can do of course we will. Let\u2019s try to do something but we have to have that discussion.\u201d",

Or maybe they subscribe to the Michael Gove school of thought, believing \u201cwe\u2019ve had enough of experts\u201d.\nAdvice does change and evolve as the scientific community learns more about this virus. However, MPs should acknowledge this fact rather than making ill-informed statements regarding \u201cilliterate guff\u201d. If they really want all students and staff back in the learning environment, working in a socially distanced safe setting, maybe they could investigate setting up Nightingale annexes for schools and recruiting newly retired and student teachers. This will provide the extra resource that the education system desperately needs, in addition to adding some weight to this government\u2019s claim to be \u201clevelling up\u201d the country.Kevin McCreadySheffield\n Your coverage of the twin challenges in education presented by the exam results fiasco and the return to classrooms early next month was illuminating. Justine Greening\u2019s voice carries some authority. She is almost certainly right to claim that Gavin Williamson would have known the implications for more disadvantaged students, well before having the mendacity to blame others or errant algorithms (Justine Greening: exams crisis could be Boris Johnson\u2019s Black Wednesday, 25 August).\nA similar straw man argument unsurprisingly came from the prime minister when he claimed the moral high ground in demanding full returns to schools and colleges. Of course, this is precisely what nearly all parents, students, teachers and heads also want.\nYet, as was well-demonstrated by another report (Headteachers launch stinging criticism of education secretary, 24 August), they know that to safely reopen schools and, crucially, to re-establish confidence, is a huge task requiring far more than the vague words that are often the prime minister\u2019s only contribution to all difficult issues. As a parent of a year 4 pupil, due to go back to school next week, I have full confidence that her headteacher will make well-informed decisions, grounded in compassion and wisdom, when deciding how to safely manage the welfare of all children and adults in her care. If only Johnson or Williamson could show any of those qualities, we might all better face the coming challenges of autumn.Ian RichardsonBeverley, East Riding of Yorkshire\n I woke from a bad dream in the night. My husband and I teach at schools with 1,500-plus pupils. Two of our children go to the same school with 1,500 students and my son is starting at a college with 3,000. That\u2019s 7,500 plus community contacts between us.\nI don\u2019t want to trigger anxiety in my children, but we are going to have to talk to them about strictly no physical contact at school or on the way home, and regular use of hand sanitiser gel (as access to sinks will be limited), no public transport, except in an emergency, showers on return from school and all clothes in the wash every day.

Her lawyer said she only found out later that the college had not yet considered the allegations to have been officially made because they were not in writing.\n\u201cS\u201d alleges that in the intervening period the same male perpetrated a \u201cviolent and sexual assault\u201d against her.\nThe women\u2019s lawyer, John Watkins, of Bater Law, told the Guardian he believed at least 16 women had made similar allegations against the same person, including his two clients, though not all of them were willing to go on the record. \u201cA\u201d and \u201cS\u201d have threatened the college with legal action, claiming it failed in its duty to them.\nWatkins said on Thursday he believed the college\u2019s investigating officer had incorrectly downgraded many of the allegations made by other women, including those of \u201cS\u201d.\nHe said the investigator did not consider all of the allegations as being corroborative of those made by \u201cA\u201d, which were taken alone.

There weren\u2019t. There was one allegation against him on a sexual assault. There were numerous allegations of inappropriate touching.\u201d\nA college spokesperson said it would be inappropriate to comment on the specific allegations because of the legal process, but that every report of inappropriate behaviour was treated with the \u201cutmost seriousness\u201d.\n\u201cThe safety and wellbeing of our students and staff is of the highest importance and we have formal mechanisms in place to both safeguard and support members of the college community who wish to report incidents.\u201d\nThey said the college\u2019s policies and procedures were kept under constant review.\n\u201cWe remain committed to listening openly to any member of our community, current or previous, who wish to report an incident through our formal processes \u2013 whether recent or historic.

It quoted the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) as saying this had created \u201csignificant uncertainty\u201d about the risks of debris blocking channels for cooling the reactor and causing fuel cladding to melt.\nAfter a two-year investigation, the ONR said on Thursday that reactor 3 at Hunterston would be allowed to restart as planned, but it would only be allowed to generate electricity for approximately six months.\nEDF then plans to apply next spring to extend its life for one final six-month run. EDF said it would begin the process of decommissioning Hunterston no later than the first week of 2022.\nEDF also operates Scotland\u2019s second nuclear power station, Torness, on the east coast south of Edinburgh. Running since 1988, its two reactors can produce up to 1.2GW of electricity. It is due to remain operational until 2030 at the earliest.\nHunterston\u2019s closure has reignited concern over energy policy. Both the UK and Scottish governments aim to increase low-carbon energy supplies to help meet climate goals.\nGary Smith, the regional secretary of the union GMB Scotland, said the job losses from the closure \u201cwould pose massive long-term challenges for what is quite a deprived area of Scotland. The Scottish government now has a huge problem with its energy policy: more imported gas will be burnt to keep the lights on. Renewables on their own won\u2019t do that.\u201d\nThe Scottish National party government in Edinburgh has an anti-nuclear policy but has backed efforts to extend the life of Hunterston and Torness, while phasing out coal-fired power stations and building up renewable sources in Scotland.\nIn 2016 Scotland\u2019s two nuclear stations produced 43% of its electricity. In 2018, the year Hunterston went offline after the reactor cracks were uncovered, that fell to 28%.\nRichard Dixon, the director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: \u201cIn terms of energy security, clearly there\u2019s no problem. Its reactors haven\u2019t been running and the lights haven\u2019t gone out. What\u2019s more urgent now is to build up renewables and energy efficiency, to make sure the gap left by Hunterston is filled by zero-carbon electricity or energy saving.\u201d\nSimone Rossi, EDF\u2019s UK chief executive, said the decision to shut the nuclear plant \u201cunderlines the urgent need for investment in new, low-carbon nuclear power to help Britain achieve net zero and secure the future for its nuclear industry, supply chain and workers.\u201d\nAcross the UK there are eight operational nuclear power plants, which generate a steady supply of electricity about two-thirds of the time. In total they supplied 18.7% of the UK\u2019s electricity in 2018, down from just over 20% the year before. All but one are due to close within the next decade.\nTom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said a nuclear programme would help create \u201ctens of thousands of secure, skilled and well-paid jobs\u201d while helping to meet the UK\u2019s future electricity demand, which is projected to quadruple in the coming decades.\nEDF said in a letter to the local community this month that it had invested more than \u00a3200m in investigating whether Hunterston\u2019s graphite reactor would remain safe under a range of worst-case scenarios, including a one-in-10,000-years seismic event, which is much larger than the UK has ever recorded.",

The most common sexual assault injuries requiring hospital care were burns and injuries to the trunk and head.\nThe report, Sexual Assault in Australia, brings together data from a variety of sources and includes new analysis. In 2018, police recorded roughly 18,300 sexual assaults against victims who were aged 15 and over, but that figure only includes those reported to police. The sexual assault rate was higher for those aged 15\u201319 (455 assaults per 100,000) than any other age group. Overall, the rate of sexual assaults reported to police was seven times higher for women compared with men.\nAccording to estimates from the Personal Safety Survey, the proportion of women aged 18 and over who were sexually assaulted at least once in the 12 months prior to the survey increased from 1% in 2012 to 1.6% in 2016. The proportion of men assaulted was similar for both years (0.4% in 2012 and 0.6% in 2016). In 2018\u201319, 97% of sexual assault offenders recorded by police were men, the report found. The Personal Safety Survey does not rely on police data, but collects information directly from men and women aged 18 years and above about the nature and extent of violence they have experienced since the age of 15, whether they reported it to police or not.\nThe CEO of Gender Equity Victoria, Tanja Kovac, said despite the high-profile MeToo movement, high-profile prosecutions of men and increased investment in behavioural change, statistics around violence against women were worsening.\n\u201cThis problem is so deep and intergenerational that we need permanent significant investment to address it. Violence prevention services across Australia will tell you we don\u2019t get that,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIf we spent the same amount on ending violence that we spend on ending traffic accidents and workplace deaths, we might start to see changes in behaviour. But there is a gendered bias in the way we address this dangerous behaviour which is leading to deaths of women.\u201d\nGender Equity Victoria was especially worried about how high male violence is in Australia against other men and gender diverse people. \u201cWe\u2019re also particularly concerned about male violence towards women \u2013 including journalists, sports stars, politicians \u2013 online,\u201d she said.\nSexual harassment and technologically-facilitated abuse wasn\u2019t included in the Australian Bureau of Statistics definition of sexual assault, so these attacks were not included in the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report.\n\u201cWe argue that they should be,\u201d Kovac said. \u201cTimes are changing and we live a lot of our public lives online now. Especially during Covid-19. When women receive rape threats online, or her personal images are published online without her consent, it is sexual assault.\u201d\nThe data in the report covered a time period before the Covid-19 pandemic. However, findings from an online survey of 15,000 women aged 18 years and over published by the Australian Institute of Criminology, found that 2.2% of all women and 4.2% of women in cohabiting relationships experienced sexual violence in the first three months of the pandemic.\nThe CEO for Our Watch, Patty Kinnersly, said sexual assault is \u201cdevastatingly common in Australia\u201d.\n\u201cIt is also a highly gendered issue,\u201d she said. \u201cAs the data consistently shows, what links all forms of violence against women is that they are overwhelmingly perpetrated by men.\u201d\nShe said more needed to be done to address individual men\u2019s attitudes and behaviours as well as attitudes embedded across society.\n\u201cWe must also challenge some men\u2019s rigid adherence to harmful masculinities \u2013 this is the expectation that says men should be strong, stoic, competitive, or aggressive. This rigid adherence often creates attitudes of sexual entitlement and promotes or excuses aggressive behaviour and dominance and control over women,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt is the responsibility of all levels of government as well as businesses, sporting organisations, the media and individuals to continue to challenge gender inequality and disrespect towards women.\u201d\nThe Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report also examined criminal court cases for sexual assault. Young men aged 15\u201319 when police proceedings commenced had the highest offender rates (103 per 100,000) of any age group. For finalised defendants with a principal offence of sexual assault found guilty in 2018\u201319, the most common sentence was custody in a correctional institution (57%). Custodial sentence length ranged from under three months (2.5% of custodial sentences) to 10 or more years (5.8%). Sentences of at least two but less than five years were most common (30%).\n Institute spokeswoman Louise York said sexual assault can have a range of ongoing consequences for a victim.\n\u201cVictims can experience physical injury, but also many other, ongoing effects, such as fear, anxiety, and changes to their sleep, diet and social routines, as well as their ability to work,\u201d she said.\nIf you or someone you know is impacted by sexual assault, family or domestic violence, call 1800RESPECT on 1800 737 732 or visit www.1800RESPECT.org.au.

        "content": "The 2020 Tour de France, scheduled to start in Nice on Saturday, is edging closer to collapse after the Alpes-Maritimes region, site of the opening stages of the race, was placed on red alert owing to the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nTensions surrounding the race ramped up further still on Thursday evening after the Lotto-Soudal team announced two of their team\u2019s support staff has tested \u201cnon-negative\u201d for Covid-19 and had been sent home from Nice. \u201cSafety remains priority number one,\u201d the statement read.\n\u201cOnly world wars have stopped the Tour de France,\u201d the Tour director, Christian Prudhomme, said in March this year, but the rapidly growing concerns over the wisdom of going forward with this year\u2019s race led to a cross-examination of the prime minister, Jean Castex, by journalists on Thursday.\n\u201cWe have taken numerous precautions and health protocols and I\u2019d remind you that this is an open-air event,\u201d Castex said. \u201cThe places where the virus spreads and there is transmission have no organisation. The Tour has an organiser.\u201d\nConfirming that Nice was one of 19 new regions to be placed under red alert, Castex stated that \u201cthe pandemic is regaining ground and now\u2019s the time to intervene\u201d, adding: \u201cFrance must do everything to prevent a new lockdown.\u201d\nBut the French education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, echoed Prudhomme in saying the Tour should go ahead. \u201cIt is a sign that we can continue to live, and of the resilience of our society,\u201d he said.\nStages one and two both finish in central Nice on Saturday and Sunday and are sure to attract large numbers of roadside fans. They also include several of the major mountain climbs just inland from the city.\nPrudhomme had also vowed that the race promoter ASO would not stage the Tour without crowds, or \u201cbehind closed doors\u201d yet the prefecture of the Alpes-Maritimes has now suggested that on this weekend\u2019s major climbs at least this may well be the case. Bernard Gonzalez, prefect of the Alpes-Maritimes, said a \u201creduced scale\u201d of Grand D\u00e9part would take place \u201calmost behind closed doors\u201d.\nThat sense of caution was confirmed by the city\u2019s mayor, Christian Estrosi. \u201cWe want zero mistakes by Monday [when the race leaves Nice],\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to show people around the world that we are beyond reproach.\u201d\nBut an increased scepticism that this year\u2019s Tour will make it to Paris or even to the first rest day, on 7 September, has taken hold, including some of the peloton\u2019s star names.\n\u201cThe way 2020 has been going, nothing surprises me any more,\u201d the Irish sprinter Sam Bennett said. \u201cWe just have to stay open-minded. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it did make it to Paris, but I also wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it didn\u2019t make it past the weekend.\u201d\nWith uncertainty over the duration of the Tour gripping the Grand D\u00e9part bubble, some teams have hinted they will race day by day, while others have insisted it will not change their long-term tactics.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a strategic plan to be in the lead in case the race stops after one and a half weeks,\u201d Tom Dumoulin, former Giro d\u2019Italia champion, and teammate to Primoz Roglic, said.\n\u201cThe winner after one and a half weeks isn\u2019t the real winner of the Tour de France. That\u2019s not a Tour de France, that\u2019s a 10-day race. It\u2019s a completely different race. We\u2019re preparing for a Grand Tour and we want to win the Tour de France.\n\u201cAt the moment it doesn\u2019t look good with some of the numbers around Nice and France but at the moment we are just in our own bubble and we\u2019re just looking to be back racing,\u201d the Dutchman said.\nYet speculation is growing that ASO has made a contingency plan, in the event that the Tour is stopped and that a winner would be declared only after the race had passed the midway point on stage 10. But the current rules of cycling, both those composed by the UCI and ASO\u2019s own regulations, are unclear and do not take into account the prospect of a truncated or cancelled Tour.\nThe Tour\u2019s current rules state the \u201cgeneral individual classification by time is established by each rider in the 21 stages taking into account penalties and time bonuses\u201d and when referring to the green points jersey or the King of the Mountains jersey state specifically that \u201cthe winners [...] must complete the Tour de France\u201d. But while the race still hangs in the balance, there was confirmation from the UCI president, David Lappartient, that a women\u2019s stage race, organised by ASO, was expected to be launched in 2022, staged immediately after the finish of the men\u2019s Tour in Paris.\n\u201cWhether this race will also be called Tour de France, I don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Lappartient told the Dutch website Wielerflits.nl. \u201cI am assured that ASO will be ready to put this event on the calendar in 2022. This is a very good step in the further development of women\u2019s cycling.\u201d",

        "content": "Permanent secretary accepts complaint over use of term in deportation video as charter flight carrying asylum seekers is cancelled\nThe most senior civil servant at the Home Office has conceded that officials should not have used the phrase \u201cactivist lawyers\u201d in a promotional video posted on Twitter, although the tweet remains online.\nThe post on Wednesday described the department\u2019s efforts to deport people with no right to remain in the UK and attacked \u201cactivist lawyers\u201d for frustrating the process, prompting a furious response from barristers and solicitors.\nMatthew Rycroft, the Home Office\u2019s permanent secretary, said in response to a complaint that he had told his team the term should not be used again.\nOn Thursday night, the Home Office confirmed that a charter flight that was due to depart to Spain carrying asylum seekers who arrived in the UK on small boats had been cancelled.\nHome Office sources said the reason for the cancellation was due to a high volume of legal challenges. While its statement on the cancellation did not make any reference to \u201cactivist lawyers\u201d it suggests that without the last-minute challenges the flight could have gone ahead.\nEarlier, writing to Jonathan Portes, a professor of economics at King\u2019s College London, Rycroft had said: \u201cThe general point the video is making is that our efforts to facilitate legitimate and legal returns are often frustrated by individuals and lawyers putting in last-minute claims. These claims are very often entirely without merit, but have the effect of timing out a return due to stringent Dublin regulations.\n\u201cHowever, I agree that the phrase you quote should not have been used on an official government channel. I have made clear to the team that this post should not be used again from Home Office accounts or anywhere else by civil servants.\u201d\nThe Dublin regulation is an EU law that broadly determines which member state is responsible for the examination of an asylum application.\nSmall boat crossings are totally unnecessary and we continue to return migrants with no right to be in the UK. Another flight left today with more planned in the coming weeks. pic.twitter.com/RCnLlqNGVM\nThe Guardian approached the Home Office for comment, which declined to issue a refreshed statement and instead pointed to a tweet sent by Portes in which an extract of Rycroft\u2019s response was included.\nUpdate: Response from @ukhomeoffice PermSec to my complaint:\"I agree the phrase you quote should not have been used on an official government channel. I have made clear to the team this post should not be used again from Home Office accounts or anywhere else by civil servants.\" pic.twitter.com/mZbLiZV58D\nReferring to the cancelled charter flight, a Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe government\u2019s efforts to facilitate entirely legitimate and legal returns of people who have entered the UK through illegal routes are too often frustrated by last-minute challenges submitted hours before a scheduled flight. These claims are very often baseless and entirely without merit, but are given full legal consideration, leading to removal being rescheduled.\u201d\nPortes had written directly to Rycroft arguing that the video was not consistent with the Government Communications Service (GCS) \u201cpropriety guidance\u201d stating that messages should \u201cbe objective and explanatory, not biased or polemical\u201d, as well as \u201csensitive to tone and guard against perceived attacks on particular interests, organisations or individuals\u201d.\nPortes told the Guardian: \u201cOne of the jobs of civil servants is to communicate government policy. But they\u2019re not allowed to use polemical language like this or target a particular group. This was way over the line. The prompt reaction of the permanent secretary is very welcome. I hope comms teams across Whitehall take note.\u201d\nLawyers condemned the video. Simon Davis, the president of the Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, said: \u201cAttacks on the integrity of the legal profession undermine the rule of law. Solicitors advise their clients on their rights under the laws created by parliament. To describe lawyers who are upholding the law as \u2018activist lawyers\u2019 is misleading and dangerous.\u201d\nToufique Hossain, director of public law at Duncan Lewis, one of the \u201cactivist lawyers\u201d the Home Office is referring to, demanded an apology from the Home Office.\n\u201cIn the light of the senior Home Office official accepting that it as wrong for the Home Office to use this term we would like an apology from Priti Patel. The cancellation of today\u2019s charter flight shows that lawyers simply made legal representations. It was not us who forced the Home Office to cancel today\u2019s charter flight. They took that decision themselves.\u201d\nAmanda Pinto QC, the chair of the Bar Council, which represents all barristers in England and Wales, said: \u201cIrresponsible, misleading communications from the government around the job that lawyers do in the public interest are extremely damaging to our society.\n\u201cLegal professionals who apply the law and follow parliament\u2019s express intention are not \u2018activists\u2019. They are merely doing their jobs, enabling people to exercise their statutory rights and defend themselves against those in power. Without those lawyers, our system would crumble.\u201d\nDavid Lammy, the shadow justice secretary, said: \u201cThe Home Office\u2019s misleading attack on solicitors who represent migrants is a deeply troubling attack on the rule of law.\n\u201cThe British legal system is respected around the world because of its reputation for fairness and independence. We should be proud that everyone who needs it is entitled to legal representation.\n\u201cThe Home Office should recognise its misjudgment by deleting the video.\u201d\nMark Serwotka, the general secretary of the PCS union, which represents civil servants, said the video was \u201ca callous and inaccurate portrayal of a complicated issue which needs compassionate and calm discussion. People fleeing persecution have the right to seek asylum in the UK, and they have the right to be treated with dignity and humanity.\n\u201cTo use a graphics similar to Dad\u2019s Army and equating that with migrants fleeing war and famine is politically and morally repugnant.\n\u201cHome Office staff do an important job often in very difficult circumstances. And the last thing they need is the home secretary [Priti Patel] playing crude political games.\u201d",

Crews had been able to hold a line against the northern edge of the CZU Lightning Complex fire, which had threatened to spill into Silicon Valley, he said at a press conference early on Thursday morning. \u201cAs far as the operation to fully extinguish it, it\u2019s a slow, painstaking process,\u201d he said.\nAlthough climate scientists and firefighters have \u201cknown for a long time\u201d that fires in California are going to get more extreme and more destructive due to climate change, the scope and size of the current flames are \u201csurprising\u201d, said Chris Field, who directs the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s shocking to see the number of fires occurring concurrently \u2013 just hundreds,\u201d Field told the Guardian. \u201cAnd it\u2019s shocking to see the fires grow to over a million acres. This is a truly gigantic event.\u201d\nDespite successes in containing the flames in that region, they grew about 200 acres overnight and crews were continuing to search for two men who had gone missing. Firefighters and utility workers are clearing debris to make way for those returning home.\nMany, however, were left with nowhere to return.\nSarah Fulop-Furlano, 41, had evacuated with her husband and three children nearly two weeks ago, not long after she saw the first flashes of lightning behind the redwood trees that stood near the family\u2019s home in a remote community called Bonny Doon in the Santa Cruz mountains.\nShe assumed they would soon return to join their cat, Mama Kitty and their five chickens. As the blaze moved furiously up the mountainside, it became increasingly clear that wouldn\u2019t be the case.\n\u201cIt got really big and out of control really fast,\u201d Fulop-Furlano said of the fire. As her husband raced toward the house in one last effort to salvage what he could, the sky was glowing orange and he could feel the encroaching heat of the blaze.\n\u201cIt was just eerie. There was no sound \u2013 no birds, no wildlife, nothing,\u201d said Fulop-Furlano. As he stood contemplating what else he could save, a gust of wind blew a children\u2019s toy across the driveway, and he knew the flames had arrived.\nA day after the blaze and still unable to return to their home, Fulop-Furlano recognized her son\u2019s burnt tricycle, standing amid smoldering ashes, in a photo that was circulating the internet. \u201cSeeing that photo was the first time it sunk in for me just how devastating this fire was,\u201d she said.\nSome of her neighbors are among those who defied evacuation orders and formed pop-up firecrews that stayed behind to protect their homes from blazes.\n\u201cI know this has been catastrophic across the state and Cal Fire is stretched so thin, but there was just a mentality that \u2018If Cal Fire isn\u2019t up here, we\u2019re going to do it ourselves\u2019,\u201d she said.\nNow, the Fulop-Furlano family is undergoing the \u201cgutting experience of trying to itemize what we lost\u201d, knowing that the toughest losses are the priceless heirlooms that can\u2019t be claimed on an insurance list.\nIterations of her story are scattered all across and around the San Francisco Bay area, where residents have been confronted with a barrage of blazes \u2013 including the second and third largest wildfires on record \u2013 before California\u2019s peak fire season has even kicked off.\nThe LNU Lightning Complex fires, searing through California\u2019s wine country, had burned through nearly 369,000 acres and in recent days had been neck and neck with the concurrent SCU Lightning Complex fire east of the San Francisco Bay for the rank of second largest fire in recorded California history.\nThough reinforcements from other states and countries have aided fire crews, spread thin as hundreds of concurrent fires burned across the state, harsh, dry weather conditions over the preceding fortnight has desiccated fire-fueling vegetation, which fed and stoked giant, unwieldy blazes.\nFresh evacuation orders were issued after the LNU fire jumped a highway and threatened homes in Colusa and Yolo counties. The fire has killed at least five people, including Douglas Mai, 82, and Leon Bone, 64, of Vacaville.\nSmoke from fires across the west has carried across the country, choking some regions with toxic smoke \u2013 and leaving those with respiratory conditions who are already susceptible to deadly complications from contracting Covid-19, especially vulnerable.\nEvacuees throughout the state have had to weigh the risks of staying with family or at evacuation centers, where they might spread or contract coronavirus, against the costs of isolating up in pricey hotel rooms or staying in their vehicles.\nWildfire scientists and state officials have warned of a bleak outlook over the coming months. \u201cWe are putting every single asset we possibly can, pointing every conceivable resource, to battle these historic wildfires,\u201d Governor Gavin Newsom said at a press conference on Wednesday. The onslaught of flames this month, \u201cputs us not only on pace to have a historic wildfire season but actually sets the pace for a historic wildfire season\u201d, he said.\nAutumn, when powerful offshore winds have traditionally stoked the biggest, most destructive fires in California, is still to come. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019ve had really serious fires in August doesn\u2019t decrease the risk of serious fires in October and November at all,\u201d Field said.\nAlthough California\u2019s landscape is adapted to fires, climate change has fueled more extreme, destructive blazes \u2013 and each day, the risks of bigger and more catastrophic disasters are gaining traction, Field said. \u201cI think of it like \u2013 we\u2019re in a car, trying to make a sharp turn at 85 miles per hour,\u201d he explained. As the climate crisis accelerates, \u201cit\u2019s that we could barely stay on the road, and now the risk is we\u2019re going to swerve off.\u201d",

A nothing. The latter two accusations made against Brenton Tarrant in the high court of Christchurch this week were the most factual; convicted of 51 counts of murder and an act of terrorism, his sentence of life without parole has consigned him to the void. He will cease to exist.\nGood. He was bad rubbish, sentenced with all the beautiful and solemn efficiency of English law as practised in New Zealand, but the thing everyone will remember about the past few days is the testimony from those who survived the attack and the families of the victims.\nThey transformed the sentencing, reclaimed it, made it their own story \u2013 again, Tarrant was obliterated, made nothing. The images of the killer in his grey prison rags and his balding head are not going to burn themselves into the national consciousness. He was a forgettable sort of person.\nAnd while no one is going to fall over themselves in a mad rush to ascribe any kind of virtue to the man who executed defenceless men, women, and children, at least he got out of the way at the high court.\nFor all the fears he would use the sentencing to make a hate speech, he opted to keep quiet. He didn\u2019t laugh or stare down or confront, or anything like that. Dignity is probably going too far but he showed something resembling restraint. \nJustice Mander asked him if he\u2019d like to address the terms of his sentence.\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d he said. And that was all he ever did say, a polite little sign-off from an otherwise blank presence.\nTarrant\u2019s sentencing will act as some kind of cleansing. Justice was seen to be done.\n\u201cThe harm to the survivors, the victims families, the Muslim community of Christchurch, and to the rest of New Zealand, is irreparable,\u201d prosecutor Mark Zarifeh said in court.\nThat\u2019s a pretty big claim to make about the rest of New Zealand. It\u2019s true that we\u2019ll continue to live with the knowledge and the horror of Tarrant\u2019s attack; even school children know what 15 March means. But the sentencing has removed him from sight.\nWe learned from a psychiatric report that: \u201cHe said he was terribly unhappy\u201d. You don\u2019t say. \u201cThe offender described it [the attack] as non-personal, chaotic, and confusing\u201d.\nThe vague terrorist, the baffled perpetrator of the worst case of murder in New Zealand history. He regretted to police that he hadn\u2019t killed more people \u2013 he was on his way to nearby Ashburton to attack another mosque when officers rammed his car \u2013 and there was a new piece of information revealed in court about a Fijian man who Tarrant drew up alongside in his car, and tried to shoot, but the gun failed to fire.\nTarrant is extraordinary as a terrorist and the only man to be given life without parole \u2013 \u201cwhole life\u201d they rather satisfying call it in the English courts \u2013 since legislation was introduced in 2010. But little else about him seems very interesting. He\u2019s gone from not much to nothingness.\n\u201cNew Zealanders,\u201d wrote the historian Michael King, \u201cwhatever their cultural backgrounds, are good-hearted, practical, commonsensical and tolerant. Those qualities are part of the national cultural capital that has in the past saved the country from the worst excesses of chauvinism and racism seen in other parts of the world.\u201d\nKing\u2019s resounding sentences conclude his great work The Penguin History of New Zealand, a book so massively popular that it was as though it had been mailed to every household in New Zealand. It was published in 2003. You will note the words \u201cin the past\u201d.\nThe worst excesses of racism and sheer hatred visited New Zealand on 15 March, 2019. But the nobility shown in the law courts in Christchurch this week from one Muslim New Zealander after another, and the outpouring of public sympathy and support, affirmed King\u2019s assessment of a good-hearted country.\nYesterday was a good day.\nSteve Braunias is a journalist and author who lives in Auckland, New Zealand",

Although we\u2019re now starting to see a steady but slow recovery, the pandemic has taken away almost a decade of growth at Pret.\u201d\nThe chain is the latest in a long line of businesses to cut jobs in response to lower urban footfall, with only 17% of staff back in their workplace by early August, according to research by the Centre for Cities.\nThe global advertising giant WPP said on Thursday that just 3% of its 10,000 UK staff are regularly in the office.\nGrab-and-go food outlets that rely on hungry office workers and commuters have been particularly hard hit by the shift in working patterns. The airport and train station specialist SSP, which owns Caf\u00e8 Ritazza and Upper Crust, said in July it would cut 5,000 jobs because of dwindling passenger numbers, while the high street cafe Le Pain Quotidien shed 200 staff after it was bought out of administration.\nAs Pret added to the pile of job losses, the Labour party urged Boris Johnson to come up with an urgent plan to save city centres.\nThe shadow minister for business and consumers, Lucy Powell, called for a package of financial support to make up for lost footfall, including the relaxation of restrictions on which businesses can apply for \u00a312.3bn in grant money.\nAbout \u00a31.4bn of the grants, only available to businesses below a certain size, are set to be clawed back by the government because they are unused.\n\u201cThe bigger city centres are very, very hard hit,\u201d said Powell. \u201cIt\u2019s a double whammy. It\u2019s not just the office workers, which is a big part of what makes up retail and hospitality, but also for somewhere like Manchester, all that is added to by the footfall from football matches, massive concerts, weddings, hen nights and conferences.\n\u201cThe government\u2019s got to recognise that the economic support does need to follow whether companies are allowed to reopen or not,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need a bigger plan for city centres. This is a whole ecosystem.\u201d\nEarlier on Thursday, the CBI\u2019s director-general, Carolyn Fairbairn, writing in the Daily Mail, called on the prime minister to do more to get office workers back to their desks to prevent cities from becoming ghost towns.\nPlans being put into place by large employers indicate that hundreds of thousands of mostly white-collar workers will continue working from home, in some cases permanently, despite the reopening of schools in England over the next fortnight.",

The 27-year-old immediately launched an appeal and, close to tears, on Thursday night spoke publicly for the first time about the episode on BBC News at Ten.\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel I owe an apology to anybody. An apology is something when you have done something wrong,\u201d Maguire said. \u201cI regret putting the fans and club through this but I did nothing wrong.\n\u201cIt was horrible, not something I would want to do again. I don\u2019t wish it on anybody. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been inside a prison.\u201d\nThe reference to an apology came after the prosecution lawyer, Ioannis Paradissis, stated on Wednesday that if Maguire said sorry this could \u201cpave the way for \u201ca different sentiment\u201d to prevail when his appeal is heard. Maguire\u2019s defence had claimed during Saturday\u2019s hearing that his younger sister, Daisy, had been injected with a substance.\nHe reiterated this claim: \u201cThese two men approached my little sister, asked her where she was from, she responded and then my fiancee, Fern, saw my little sister\u2019s eyes going into the back of her head. She was fainting and was in and out of consciousness and \u2026\u201d Maguire said, before breaking down. \u201cSorry.\u201d\nMaguire tried to get his sister to a hospital but instead he and his party were taken to a police station.\n\u201cMy initial thought was that we were being kidnapped,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got down on our knees and put our hands in the air and they just started hitting us.\n\u201cThey were hitting my legs saying my career is over. Saying: \u2018No more football. You won\u2019t play again\u2019.\n\u201cAt this point I thought there was no chance these are police so I tried to run away. I was in that much of a panic, fear. Scared for my life. All the way through it.\u201d\nMaguire was asked if he did try to bribe the police. \u201cNo, for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cAs soon as I saw that statement \u2013 [I thought]: \u2018It\u2019s just ridiculous\u2019.\u201d\nUnited are supporting the defender and he remains the captain. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive privilege to play for Manchester United and be captain but obviously it\u2019s not my decision to make,\u201d Maguire said.\n\u201cI have great faith in Greek law that the retrial will give us more time to prepare, gather the evidence and allow witnesses into the court. I\u2019m really confident the truth will be told and come out.\u201d\nMaguire had been out with family and friends. They included his brother Joe, one of his two co-defendants, who were each sentenced to 13 months \u2013 again suspended. His appeal may take between one to two years to be heard.",

Plus, the drawbacks of gas-burning stovetops \nGood morning, this is Emilie Gramenz bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 28 August.\nMore than 100 ancient Aboriginal sites in Western Australia \u2013 some of which date before the last ice age \u2013 could be destroyed by mining companies which have already obtained legal permission to do so. Guardian Australia has spoken to traditional owners in the iron ore-rich Pilbara who reveal their fears for sacred sites, including rock shelters with painted walls and scar trees. A federal inquiry was established in response to the destruction by Rio Tinto of a 46,000-year-old rock shelter at Juukan Gorge deemed to be of the highest archaeological significance.\nThe UK has recorded the highest number of new coronavirus cases since 12 June. Both the daily case number and the seven-day rolling average are now higher than on 23 March, the day national lockdowns were announced. France has recorded a new post-lockdown record of daily cases and Italy has the country\u2019s highest daily tally since 6 May. The World Health Organization warns Europe is entering \u201ca tricky moment\u201d as children go back to school, with Germany set to ban large events. Italian health authorities are tracing visitors to the former Formula One team boss Flavio Briatore\u2019s Sardinian nightclub amid fears of a cluster after more than 60 cases were linked to the venue.\nPrivately operated aged care homes are behind the devastating Covid-19 infection rates in Victorian health workers. Nurses would not be infected at such rates if more of the homes had surge workforce plans in place and were audited regularly to ensure those plans were adequate, the nurses\u2019 union says. Australian Twitter users focused on panic buying, while tweets with anti-China language and hashtags were predominantly from the US, a Monash University analysis of 2.5m tweets from six countries in the early months of the pandemic shows. And Anthony Albanese says Australia\u2019s aged care sector will need \u201cstructural changes\u201d after the royal commission has completed its work.\nBusiness, industry, farming and environmental leaders have joined forces to warn Australia is \u201cwoefully unprepared\u201d for the impact of climate change over the coming decades. The statement urges the government to do far more to cut emissions and improve the country\u2019s resilience.\nWomen in their late teens are more likely than other Australians to be victims of sexual assault, while young men of the same age group are most likely to be perpetrators. The findings come from a new report by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.\nGoogle is lobbying Labor and crossbench MPs to oppose a proposed code that would require digital platforms to pay news media companies for content. The tech giant\u2019s lobbying efforts supplement a major digital campaign to mobilise its huge user base against the proposal. \nAn analysis shows a NSW mining industry push for approval of 21 new coal projects would add seven years\u2019 worth of Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere, if they were all developed.\nPolice in Kenosha, the Wisconsin city rocked by protests and deadly violence since the shooting of Jacob Blake, have named the officer who fired multiple bullets into Blake\u2019s back.

The world\u2019s largest retailer wants to become a force in the fast-growing digital media sector.\nAnti-war campaigners in the UK are calling on the army to drop proceedings against a soldier who was arrested after he staged a one-man protest against Britain\u2019s involvement in the Saudi bombing of Yemen near Downing Street.\nThe appointment of former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott as a British trade envoy is a baffling choice, writes Malcolm Farr: \u201cHis lack of sales craft is exposed by the fact he was sacked by his own party as prime minister in 2015, and by his local constituents as an MP in 2019. Certainly he won the prime ministership, but it was from a Labor party which had changed leaders three times in six years. The ALP was begging to be defeated. Abbott is the hairy-chested variety of deal maker, preferring bulldozer tactics to finesse.\u201d\nShould you give up cooking with gas? Beloved by chefs and home cooks alike, gas-burning stovetops come with drawbacks for human, financial and planetary health. A future without gas stoves is already looking likely for some Australians. In the ACT, plans are under way to phase out domestic gas use.\nIf you\u2019re looking for something new to read this weekend, The Labyrinth by Amanda Lohrey is a meditative and sprawling novel to lose yourself in.

        "content": "One fundraiser for Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, was shared more than 17,700 times by groups with more than 3.9m aggregate followers\nFundraisers, messages of support and celebratory memes for the alleged Kenosha, Wisconsin, mass shooter are being shared widely on Facebook and Instagram, despite the company\u2019s assurance on Wednesday that it was working to enforce its policy banning content that \u201cpraises, supports, or represents\u201d mass shooters.\nOne fundraiser for Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, was shared more than 17,700 times on Facebook, including by 291 public groups and pages with more than 3.9m aggregate followers, according to data from CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned data analytics tool. A second fundraiser garnered 1,698 shares on the platform, including by an additional 17 pages and groups with nearly 400,000 followers.\nRittenhouse was arrested on Wednesday and charged with first degree intentional homicide in connection with the fatal shooting at a Black Lives Matter protest in Kenosha late Tuesday night. The deceased victims have been identified as Anthony Huber, 26, and Joseph Rosenbaum, 36. A third victim, Gaige Grosskreutz, 26, was wounded and is expected to survive.\nFacebook designated the shooting a \u201cmass shooting\u201d \u2013 a ruling that invokes the company\u2019s ban on praise, support, or representation of a mass shooter or the shooting itself, a spokesperson said on Wednesday. And yet those types of posts continue to be spread widely on the platform, according to a Guardian analysis of CrowdTangle data.\nHundreds of Facebook posts and memes featuring the phrase \u201cFree Kyle\u201d or \u201cFree Kyle Rittenhouse\u201d had garnered more than 70,000 interactions as of Thursday morning. Many of the posts include stills captured from videos of Rittenhouse carrying his assault rifle before, during and after the shooting. One meme posted on Wednesday afternoon by the page \u201cAll About Trump 2020\u201d, which has more than 32,000 followers, shows Rittenhouse with his arm raised in the air and includes the caption, \u201c3 commies down\u201d.\nDozens of similar \u201cFree Kyle\u201d memes were also attracting significant support and engagement on Instagram, where they had been liked nearly 60,000 times. The Instagram hashtags #KyleRittenhouseIsAHero and #KyleRittenhouseDidNothingWrong revealed hundreds of pro-shooter memes and posts.\nThe fundraisers that were shared on Facebook were removed by the fundraising platforms they were started on, Fundly and GoFundMe respectively, but many posts sharing the link alongside messages of support for Rittenhouse remain live on Facebook. The fundraisers were largely shared by groups and pages with pro-Donald Trump, anti-Joe Biden, and pro-gun or militia themes. One notable group that shared it was one of Facebook\u2019s largest anti-vaccine groups.\nCrowdTangle only includes data from public pages and groups, so the analysis does not account for content that may be spreading in private groups or among individual users.\nSome of those sharing pro-Rittenhouse content appeared aware of Facebook\u2019s ban on content that praises or supports mass shooters. Some users are attempting to blur the wording in their memes to evade Facebook\u2019s AI systems; others are using the threat of censorship to inspire more dissemination of the pro-shooter material.\nOn Thursday morning, Joshua Feuerstein, an Evangelical Christian social media influencer best known for a viral video in which he complained about Starbucks\u2019 red holiday cups, shared a meme showing a photo of Rittenhouse during the shooting with the slogan, \u201cI stand with Kyle Rittenhouse\u201d. \u201cSHARE THIS BEFORE THEY TAKE IT DOWN AGAIN!\u201d Feuerstein wrote to his 2.6 million fans. His fans responded, sharing the image more than 3,700 times over about two hours before the image was removed.\nFacebook is facing increased scrutiny over the use of its platform by groups threatening or intending to commit violence. A newly formed local militia called Kenosha Guard used Facebook to organize an event for \u201cArmed citizens to protect our lives and property\u201d in Kenosha on the night of the shooting. It is not yet clear if Rittenhouse responded to the Facebook \u201ccall to arms\u201d, which was also amplified by the conspiracy site InfoWars.\nFollowing the shooting, Facebook removed the Kenosha Guard page and its event for violating its new policy against US-based militias with links to violence. Two Facebook users told tech news site The Verge that they had reported the page and the event invitation to Facebook before the shooting, out of concerns that violence would occur, only to have Facebook moderators say that the pages did not violate any rules.\n\u201cWhat happened in Kenosha was preventable but Facebook chose to look the other way yet again,\u201d said Madihha Ahussain, Muslim Advocates\u2019 special counsel for anti-Muslim bigotry. \u201cBefore any more people are threatened by armed bigots and any more lives are lost, Facebook must finally take responsibility for the horror it continues to enable and stop militias and hate groups from using its platforms to organize hate.\u201d\nHenry Fernandez, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said: \u201cFacebook must ensure that its event pages will not be used to kill people. If it cannot do so, then it should get out of the events page business.\u201d\nFacebook did not immediately respond to multiple requests for comment. Brian Fishman, Facebook\u2019s head of counter-terrorism and dangerous organizations, said in a Twitter thread that the company was \u201cstill scaling up enforcement\u201d on its new policy against militias and other groups linked to violence. Fishman also said that the alleged shooter\u2019s accounts had not been reported by anyone before the shooting, and that the company had not found any evidence to suggest Rittenhouse followed the militia page or was invited to the event.\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019ve had too many tragedies like those in Kenosha. Companies like Facebook owe it to everyone to closely examine the influence of online content on such violence \u2013 and to take action to stop it.\u201d\nThe social media company\u2019s efforts to crack down on the posts supporting Rittenhouse are probably complicated by the behavior of the rightwing media. The Fox News host Tucker Carlson justified Rittenhouse\u2019s actions on Wednesday, though he stopped short of praising the alleged murderer. Facebook has long been sensitive to complaints of anti-conservative bias from Republican politicians and rightwing publications. If the American right adopts Rittenhouse as a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, Facebook may be forced to pick sides.",

        "content": "Andrew Hastie says China\u2019s Thousand Talents Plan may be designed to harvest research, talent and intellectual property\nThe Morrison government is facing calls from its backbench to launch its own inquiry into foreign interference in Australian academia, with the head of the powerful security committee saying he is ready and willing to take on the task.\nAndrew Hastie, the chairman of the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, told Guardian Australia the inquiry should be broad enough to investigate \u201cmurky, undeclared\u201d research collaboration along with foreign interference in academic freedom on university campuses.\nHastie\u2019s concerns included that China\u2019s Thousand Talents Plan \u2013 a research collaboration program \u2013 may be \u201cdesigned to harvest research and talent and intellectual property from other countries for the benefit of the Chinese government\u201d.\nLabor is also open to backing such an inquiry, with Guardian Australia learning that senior opposition frontbenchers are seeking a briefing from security and intelligence officials to hear about their concerns very soon.\nThe major parties are considering their position after independent MP Bob Katter gave notice that he would move a motion in the lower house next week calling for an investigation into alleged efforts by the Chinese Communist party \u201cto exert influence over Australia\u2019s universities\u201d \u2013 a proposal that the Liberal MP Craig Kelly has said he would second.\nKatter\u2019s motion also references concern over the 13 Australian universities that have Confucius Institutes \u2013 Chinese language and culture centres that are linked to China\u2019s education ministry.\nKatter said PJCIS members would have the \u201ccourage\u201d to fully investigate the issues and he sensed the government was open to an inquiry. \u201cI think that we are watching tectonic plate movement here,\u201d Katter said.\nIt is understood Coalition backbenchers are lobbying ministers to take the initiative rather than leaving it to an independent\u2019s motion.\nThere has been intense focus on China\u2019s Thousand Talents Plan after reports in the Australian newspaper this week indicated some Australian participants were subject to secretive arrangements and an understanding that China would retain the intellectual property of any inventions or research.\nThe intelligence agency Asio has been briefing universities on the risks of such programs.\nHastie said while no one was opposed to research collaboration, it should be done transparently. He said he was concerned that Australian taxpayers \u201cmay be indirectly funding Chinese military research\u201d and \u201cresearch that further grows the unblinking eye of the Chinese surveillance state\u201d.\n\u201cIf the Australian government\u2019s committing millions and millions of dollars towards research, every single taxpayer has a stake in that research,\u201d Hastie said in an interview.\n\u201cMany of us aren\u2019t confident that our universities are properly regulating themselves, or that they\u2019re managing conflicts of interest, or that they\u2019re actually aware of what\u2019s going on with many of these scientists who haven\u2019t declared their involvement in the Thousand Talents Plan or indeed the transfer of technology and intellectual property to China.\u201d\nHastie said there was a fair amount of support on the backbench for a thorough inquiry, and the PJCIS was willing and able to conduct the inquiry if referred.\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready to go,\u201d Hastie said. \u201cWe already have a number of relationships of trust across across government and our intelligence and law enforcement agencies. We can do both classified and unclassified hearings.\u201d\nHe said the inquiry should also address academic freedom \u2013 such as the case of University of NSW adjunct lecturer Elaine Pearson being censored over an article on the Hong Kong crackdown, for which the university apologised.\nWhen informed of Hastie\u2019s position, the Labor deputy chair of the committee, Anthony Byrne, said he was \u201chappy to support the chair in this matter proceeding to the PJCIS if required\u201d.\n\u201cI think there is now sufficient evidence in the public domain to warrant an appropriate inquiry into this matter,\u201d Byrne said. \u201cI\u2019m aware of the excellent work that\u2019s been done by the agencies tasked with countering foreign interference but there is more to be done and I do think we need to shine some sunlight on this issue.\u201d\nLabor\u2019s foreign affairs spokesperson, Penny Wong, confirmed her party was \u201ccertainly open to a discussion about it\u201d.\nWong noted she had spoken last year \u201cabout the importance of the government actually giving universities greater guidance and more resources to understand how to manage\u201d these engagements.\nPressed on whether such an inquiry could be done without becoming a witch hunt, Wong said: \u201cUnfortunately we\u2019ve seen, at times, a fair bit of theatre, but I hope people can be sensible about these issues.\u201d\nThe Liberal senator James Paterson said an inquiry would help deliver \u201ccomplete transparency about foreign government attempts to recruit Australian academics\u201d.\nA spokesperson for the education minister, Dan Tehan, said decisions about parliamentary inquiries were \u201cfor the parliament\u201d to make.\nThe spokesperson said Tehan had already arranged for the education department to provide private briefings on \u201cthe government\u2019s work to strengthen protections against foreign interference\u201d to several committees including the PJCIS.\nThe debate comes as the government pushes for new powers allowing the foreign affairs minister to cancel agreements between public universities and foreign government entities.\nUniversities have already been under intense financial pressure over the loss of revenue from international students during the Covid-19 crisis and an inability to access the jobkeeper wage subsidy, with many announcing job cuts.\nThe Universities Australia chief executive, Catriona Jackson, said the sector was working alongside government agencies in the Universities Foreign Interference Taskforce on \u201crobust guidelines that build on measures to keep our institutions and intellectual property secure\u201d.\nBut she said it was important to \u201cstrike the right balance between national security and the research collaboration which is driving so many advances in knowledge \u2013 including the search for a Covid-19 vaccine\u201d.\nWang Xining, the deputy head of China\u2019s embassy in Australia, defended the Thousand Talents Plan at the National Press Club this week, when he said his country was not interested in interfering in Australia\u2019s internal affairs or undermining its sovereignty.\nWang said many of the criticisms were based on \u201chearsay and gossip\u201d. While diplomats and scientists were \u201ctrying very hard to spread sunshine over our relationship\u201d, some reporters were \u201ctrying to cast a shadow\u201d.",

An additional seven imported cases were in quarantine after arriving in New Zealand on an Air India flight.\nThe Auckland outbreak is New Zealand\u2019s largest cluster with 123 cases. The Pasifika community has been disproportionately affected and Robertson thanked south Auckland churches for hosting pop-up testing centres.\nAs of Friday there were 11 people with Covid-19 in hospital, three of them in intensive care.\nRobertson urged Aucklanders to stay the course with two days left before restrictions would be eased. Local people have said they have found the second lockdown \u201cmuch tougher\u201d than the first.\n\u201cAs a result of your actions New Zealand remains in a comparatively positive position to other countries who have experienced second-wave outbreaks, with a small number of daily cases, no additional cases and no spread of the virus beyond the cluster, so thank you,\u201d Robertson said.\n\u201cWe are nearly there but the job is not quite done.\u201d\nWhen lockdown ends at midnight on Sunday restrictions will continue to apply to social gatherings, with gatherings like church services and birthdays limited to 10, while funeral and tangi will be limited to 50.\nMask-wearing would become compulsory on public transport, Robertson said, at midnight on Sunday. The requirement would apply nationwide.\nSome epidemiologists have expressed concern at the easing of restrictions but the government has insisted it is safe to open up, as contact tracing has been successful and the outbreak has been restricted to a single cluster.\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about what it means for us moving out of level 3 on Sunday here in Auckland,\u201d said Siouxsie Wiles, a microbiologist and expert on infectious diseases at the University of Auckland, saying it could lead to \u201ctransmission happening that would have hopefully been slowed or stopped at level 3\u201d.\nMeanwhile it emerged that the US ambassador, Scott Brown, had bypassed hotel quarantine when returning to New Zealand and instead self-isolated in his Wellington home. Brown has diplomatic immunity meaning the government could not force him to enter the mandatory facilities. Brown said he and his wife tested negative for the virus before leaving the US.\n\u201cWe have been very careful about wearing masks and observing social distancing guidelines during transit. We were successfully screened by health authorities on arrival in Auckland and again in Wellington,\u201d he told Stuff.",

Of these, 651 \u2013 less than 1% \u2013 were children and young people under 19. Six of these patients \u2013 less than 1% \u2013 died. All had severe underlying health conditions.\n\u201cThey were children with profound co-morbidities \u2013 not a touch of asthma and not cystic fibrosis,\u201d said Calum Semple, professor in child health and outbreak medicine at the University of Liverpool, and co-lead of the study by the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium. Their conditions included cancer and serious neurological, blood or heart issues.\nCo-author of the paper published in the BMJ, Dr Olivia Swann, clinical lecturer in paediatric infectious diseases at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u201cThe absolute risk of being admitted to hospital is tiny.\u201d The risk of severe disease and death was also very small.\nBut among those children who were admitted to critical care, they found those under the age of one were at three times the usual risk, although that included premature babies born and diagnosed in the hospital.\nAlso at two to three times higher risk of ending up in critical care were black children. \u201cThe issues around ethnicity are very complicated,\u201d said Semple. \u201cThey are issues which can partly be explained by deprivation. Some are explained by exposure in the community.\u201d\nThere were also underlying conditions, such as high blood pressure, which are more prevalent in black people, he said. But black children who were completely healthywere at no extra risk, said Semple. The message to the mother of a black child in Brixton or Glasgow was \u201cthey are safe to go back to school\u201d, he said.\nChildren with obesity were at higher risk. So were children in the 10-14 age bracket, who were the ones more likely to suffer from multisystem inflammatory syndrome, a new condition thought to be linked to Covid-19.\nThe researchers said they have identified symptoms that should help doctors diagnose the syndrome and they hope will lead to an expansion of the World Health Organization definition of it. These were a rash, conjunctivitis, abdominal pain, vomiting, and a low blood platelet count. \u201cThe skin, gut and whole child\u2019s body is quite inflamed,\u201d said Swann.\nSemple said parents should be reassured that their children would not be at harm from returning to school. He and Swann were both sending children back in September. Among children, \u201csevere disease and death is vanishingly rare\u201d, he said.",

        "content": "Six fatalities recorded in Louisiana, including a teen girl who died after a tree fell on her home and a man who died of carbon monoxide poisoning\nHurricane Laura, the most powerful hurricane to strike the US this year, moved across Louisiana on a northerly path on Thursday, after threatening an \u201cunsurvivable storm surge\u201d on the coast and tropical force weather as far as Tennessee.\nThe storm slammed into western Louisiana overnight with gusts of up to 150mph and could cause \u201ccatastrophic conditions\u201d, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. Not until 11 hours after landfall did it finally weaken.\nOn Thursday night, Donald Trump said during his speech to close out the Republican National Convention that his thoughts were with the \u201cwonderful people who have just come through the wrath of Hurricane Laura\u201d.\nThe US president said he would visit the Gulf Coast this weekend to tour the damage.\nForecasters said an eastern turn would again make the storm a looming threat, this time to the densely populated Atlantic seaboard. Trees were down and power was out as far north as Arkansas, where remnants of the storm were centered as the once fearsome Category 4 hurricane weakened to a depression after dark.\nAdditional damage was possible as new tornado warnings were issued on Thursday evening in Mississippi and Arkansas.\nConcern was growing for people in the path of the storm in Louisiana who did not evacuate on Wednesday. Louisiana recorded six fatalities as of Thursday afternoon, including a 14-year-old girl in Vernon parish who died after a tree fell on her home, a 24-year-old man who died of carbon monoxide poisoning inside his home and a man who drowned while aboard a sinking ship.\nLaura blasted through the Louisiana coast and made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane early Thursday, wreaking damage on the industrial, casino city of Lake Charles. The storm has left more than 875,000 people without power.\nAuthorities had ordered coastal residents to get out, but not everyone did in an area devastated by Hurricane Rita in 2005. By Thursday morning, many buildings had partially collapsed or were missing chunks. Windows were blown out, awnings ripped away and trees split in half. At the local airport, planes were overturned, some on top of each other.\nLaura headed north towards Shreveport, Louisiana, on Thursday rather than west across Texas as had been one of the leading predictions, meaning the city of Houston has probably dodged a bullet, although coastal Port Arthur is threatened by storm surge flooding.\nOn Thursday morning it was confirmed a chemical plant outside Lake Charles had caught fire. Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards advised residents in the area to shelter in place. Footage of the BioLab plant in Westlake showed vast plumes of emissions billowing from plant.\nAlthough authorities had urged residents in Louisiana municipalities dotted along the coastline to evacuate there were concerns that up to 150 people in Cameron parish \u2013 where the storm landed on the US mainland \u2013 had stayed in place, leading to fears of loss of life.\n\u201cWe know anyone that stayed that close to the coast, we\u2019ve got to pray for them, because looking at the storm surge, there would be little chance of survival,\u201d Louisiana\u2019s lieutenant governor, Billy Nungesser, told ABC\u2019s Good Morning America.\nLaura is the region\u2019s most powerful hurricane in over a century, and ties for the fastest storm in Louisiana history. Experts warned earlier in the year that the hurricane season would be unusually active. Evidence suggests that the Atlantic hurricane season is becoming worse due to warming waters linked to the climate crisis.\nIn Lake Charles the fierce wind battered tall buildings, blowing out windows as debris flew around, more than 30 miles from the ocean. The highway into Lake Charles was littered with downed power lines and mobile home parks had been flattened by the high winds.\nSocial media footage showed torrents of rain rushing sideways past lampposts, and streets covered with water closer to the coast.\n\u201cThere are some people still in town and people are calling \u2026 but there ain\u2019t no way to get to them,\u201d Tony Guillory, president of the Calcasieu parish police jury, said on Thursday morning over the phone as he was battened down in a Lake Charles government building that was shaking from the storm.\nThe centre earlier warned that an \u201cunsurvivable storm surge with large and destructive waves will cause catastrophic damage from Sea Rim state park, Texas, to Intracoastal City, Louisiana\u201d.\nThe National Hurricane Center said Laura will move across south-western Louisiana on Thursday morning, and continue northward across the state through the afternoon.\nForecasters said the storm surge could be six metres (20ft) deep and unsurvivable.\nThe storm system arrived during high tide, drawing energy from the warm Gulf of Mexico.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very sad situation,\u201d said Ashley Buller, the assistant director of emergency preparedness. \u201cWe did everything we could to encourage them to leave.\u201d\nThe parts of Louisiana that were under evacuation orders included areas with high rates of Covid-19.\nThe Texas governor, Greg Abbott, and his Louisiana counterpart, feared the dire predictions were not resonating with the public, despite authorities putting more than 500,000 coastal residents under mandatory evacuation orders.\nHurricane warnings were issued from San Luis Pass in Texas to Intracoastal City in Louisiana, and reached inland for 200 miles. Storm surge warnings extended from Freeport in Texas to the mouth of the Mississippi River.\nTrump tweeted that coastal residents should heed advice from officials.",

India also recorded more than 1,000 new deaths taking total fatalities, to 61,529, the fourth highest total in the world, behind the US, Brazil and Mexico.\nThe country has recorded the highest single-day caseload in the world every day since 7 August. The largest ever one day rise is 78,427, reported by the US on 25 July.\nThe worst affected part of India is the western state of Maharashtra, home to the country\u2019s financial centre, Mumbai. The state has recorded more than 23,000 deaths. The densely populated cities of Dehli and Chennai has also experienced large outbreaks.\nThe virus has now however spread into rural and isolated communities that have limited healthcare resources. The remote Andaman and Nicobar Islands, which have a population of 400,000, have reported a total of 2,944 coronavirus cases among its non-tribal population.\nMany experts say that with India not testing enough people and many deaths not properly recorded, its death toll could be considerably higher than official data records. Several antibody tests have suggested a much wider-spread outbreak than .\nDemand for personal protection equipment has soared in the country of 1.3 billion people, leading to a booming black market in used face masks and surgical gloves scavenged in some cases from hospitals. Police in the western city of Navi Mumbai on Friday said they seized from one gang 3.8 million pieces of refurbished single-use surgical gloves that were washed, dried and packed ready for sale.\nCases also rose in Indonesia, which reported its biggest rise in new cases for a second successive day on Friday. It passed the 3,000 mark in new daily cases for the first time and added 105 new deaths, as authorities in West Java tackled outbreaks in three factories that the provincial governor said could be due to workers not following health measures.\nAmong those was at a plant owned by Japanese automaker Suzuki, which cut operations by half after 71 employees tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\u201cWhen it turns out there are clusters, there was action that didn\u2019t really abide by the protocols, such as not wearing masks diligently, not keeping a safe distance, not washing hands, or there were asymptomatic people running around doing activities,\u201d said West Java\u2019s governor, Ridwan Kamil.\nFriday\u2019s new cases nationwide brought the infections total to 165,887 and the death toll to 7,169. Indonesia\u2019s deaths are the most in Southeast Asia and its infections are the second highest after the Philippines.\nChina, where the virus was first identified, meanwhile reported nine new Covid-19 cases, all imported. It marked the twelfth consecutive day of no local transmissions, according to the National Health Commission.\nGlobal infections from Covid-19 now stand at 24.3m, with deaths totalling more than 830,000.\nIn the US \u2013 the worst hit country \u2013 Donald Trump wrapped up the Republican convention in the US suggesting a vaccine could be available before the end of the year \u201cor maybe even sooner\u201d, but Washington University warned 317,000 Americans could die from the virus by 1 December.\nTrump lauded his administration\u2019s handling of the virus at the Republican convention\u2019s final night in front a large crowd who sat close together, mostly without face masks. Trump said to \u201csave as many lives as possible, we are focusing on the science, the facts and the data\u201d.\nThere was no mention of the US\u2019s 180,000 death toll, or the 5.8m infections, as Trump recounted what he saw as the US\u2019s successes on fighting the virus, including the familiar refrain of stopping flights form China and Europe months ago.\nHe suggested a vaccine may be available in 2020 and criticised his presidential opponent:\u201cJoe Biden\u2019s plan is not a solution to the virus, but rather a surrender,\u201d Trump said.\nOn Thursday, the University of Washington expanded its forecast on US virus fatalities, projecting more than 317,000 deaths in the United States by 1 December.\nThe new forecast, by the university\u2019s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation reflected an increase of about 8,000 deaths from its previous forecast. However, the report also suggests that if 95% of Americans wore a mask, the death toll could be reduced by about 67,000 lives.\nThe IHME\u2019s projections have been cited in the past by the White House and are watched closely by public health officials.\nEurope meanwhile, faced rising infections and from Friday morning, all Parisians pedestrians had to wear face coverings. Cyclists and those using other open-air transport were included in the new directive, but not people in cars.\nThe new restriction followed the government\u2019s announcement that 21 of 101 French administrative regions, or departments, were now in the red zone where the virus was actively circulating, and where local authorities could impose stricter rules on gatherings and movements.\nThe Tour de France was reported to be in doubt after the race\u2019s starting region, the Alpes-Maritimes, was included in the red alert.\nOn Thursday France reported its second-highest level of cases ever and a new post-lockdown high, with 6,111 cases. The highest daily total of 7,578 was set on 30 March.\nMeanwhile, Spain announced schoolchildren aged six and over must wear masks to class, just days before the start of the new academic year.\nAsked whether concerned parents would have the right to keep their children at home, education minister Isabel Celaa said schools were safer than other places.\n\u201cIt is mandatory to go to class.

        "content": "As the national debt breaches the \u00a32tn mark, here is our snapshot of what is happening\nDaily new coronavirus infections peaked in early April and fell between May and early July. Since then there has been an increase in daily cases \u2013 although some of this can be attributed to increased testing. Infections have risen in some places more than others, leading to local lockdowns and other restrictions. Infections are also rising in some European countries including Spain and France, leading to quarantine controls for travellers arriving in Britain. In the UK as of 27 August, 330,368 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed and 41,477 deaths.\nDriving on Britain\u2019s roads has risen above pre-lockdown levels, as restrictions are gradually relaxed nationwide. According to Apple mobility data \u2013 which records requests made to Apple Maps for directions \u2013 driving is up by 19% compared with January. However, public transport use remains 30% down and is taking longer to recover due to the continuing risks to health. In a sign of reduced commuting, Department for Transport figures show car traffic remains lower during the week, while train journeys are still only a quarter of pre-Covid levels and London underground trips are 30% below normal. Cycling, however, has risen sharply.\nTreatments for Covid-19 and hopes that a vaccine can be developed have driven a recovery in global financial markets in the past month, fuelling optimism among investors that medical advances will limit further damage to the economy. The US approved a treatment using the plasma of recovered patients, while Oxford University scientists are making progress towards a vaccine. US stock markets laden with big tech companies \u2013 which are benefiting from more activity online during the pandemic \u2013 have hit record highs. The FTSE 100 has held steady in the past month, roughly unchanged at just over 6,000.\nUK inflation unexpectedly rose in July after the largest monthly increase in petrol prices for almost a decade and a lack of summer sales on the high street as non-essential shops reopened. The consumer price index (CPI) measure of inflation rose to 1% from 0.6% a month earlier. Retailers normally slash prices in the summer before the arrival of autumn product ranges. However, clothing and footwear prices fell by just 0.7% between June and July, compared with a fall of 2.9% in 2019. Some prices rose due to businesses passing on the extra cost of buying personal protective equipment and putting in place distancing measures.\nBritain\u2019s private sector expanded at its fastest pace for seven years in August after the lifting of lockdown for most of the country, boosted by the release of pent-up demand. The IHS Markit CIPS flash UK composite output index rose to 60.3 in August, from 57 in July. A figure above 50 indicates expansion. Activity also increased in the US. However, growth slowed in the eurozone and China, raising fears for other countries following in the path of the first country to be struck by the pandemic.\nAlmost three-quarters of a million jobs have been lost from company payrolls since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in March, as job losses begin to mount across the country. According to the Office for National Statistics, the number of workers on company payrolls fell by 730,000 between March and July, with the youngest and oldest workers most heavily affected. However, the pace of decline slowed in July with just 81,000 jobs lost since June. With millions of workers furloughed, the headline unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.9%. However, economists expect the official jobless rate to rise dramatically this autumn as the scheme is withdrawn.\nRetail sales in July jumped above pre-pandemic levels after the first full month since the reopening of non-essential shops. In a sign of pent-up demand being unleashed, the total value of sales increased by 4.4% and volume of sales by 3.6% compared with June. Internet shopping dipped slightly as physical stores reopened, but online sales remained more than 50% higher than in February, reflecting the difficulty facing some retailers as they close stores and cut jobs. Some sectors performed better than others, including food and DIY, while clothing sales remained 25.7% lower than in February.\nThe government\u2019s emergency response to the coronavirus pandemic and shrinking tax receipts as Britain falls into recession has triggered a sharp increase in public borrowing. Against this backdrop, national debt has risen to more than \u00a32tn and now exceeds the size of the UK economy for the first time since the early 1960s. Borrowing in the financial year to July is estimated to have been \u00a3150.5bn \u2013 as much as \u00a3128.4bn more than in the same period last year. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has said \u201ctough choices\u201d must be made to tackle the size of the deficit. However, economists say the cost of borrowing is at a record low and warn against cutting back state support too soon.\nBritain\u2019s economy is in the deepest recession since modern records began, after gross domestic product (GDP) fell by more than any other major nation in the second quarter. GDP plunged by 20.4% in the three months to the end of June, following a decline of 2.2% in the first three months of the year. Economists define a recession as two consecutive quarters of falling GDP. The later launch of lockdown and slower relaxation of restrictions were among key reasons for the UK suffering the sharpest fall of any G7 and EU nation. However, growth continued to strengthen in July as lockdown was gradually lifted. GDP grew by 8.7% on the month, although still remains 17.2% below its level in February before the pandemic struck.\nHouse prices have gone through a post-lockdown mini-boom, fuelled by last month\u2019s temporary stamp duty cut. Following the intervention by the chancellor to prop up the market, average property values jumped by 1.6%, or \u00a33,770, month on month in July, according to Halifax, Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender. After the market was effectively put in the deep freeze during lockdown, house prices had slumped in the previous four months. However, economists said the return to growth could be short-lived as the economy grapples with recession, and unemployment mounts.\nMore than 64m discounted meals were claimed in the first three weeks of the government\u2019s \u201ceat out to help out\u201d scheme, in a boon for the embattled hospitality sector. Figures from Opentable, a restaurant booking platform, show the numbers of people in UK restaurants on Mondays to Wednesdays, when the scheme is running, were 61% higher than this time last year. Smaller cities and seaside towns have benefited more than bigger urban centres such as London and Manchester. There are concerns, however, that more social interaction could spread the virus, while the boost for hospitality firms could fade once the scheme ends.",

        "content": "Guardian analysis shows pace of job cuts on back of Covid-19 crisis remains the concern\nBritain\u2019s economic recovery from Covid-19 gathered pace in the past month, fuelled by consumer spending and people taking advantage of the government\u2019s \u201ceat out to help out\u201d scheme, despite fears mounting over rapid growth in unemployment.\nOn the Guardian\u2019s latest monthly tracker of economic news since the pandemic spread to Britain this spring, the release of pent-up demand with the easing of lockdown is driving the sharpest rebound in economic growth among the G7 advanced economies, while retail spending has returned to pre-crisis levels.\nHowever, after the country plunged into the deepest recession on record in the three months to June, companies have started making job cuts at a faster pace than during the 2008 global financial crisis, with hundreds of thousands of redundancies announced in the past few weeks alone.\nSounding the alarm as the UK government prepares to remove its furlough job retention scheme this autumn, Frances O\u2019Grady, the director general of the TUC, warned that continued support would be required to avert a jobs catastrophe and long-term damage to the economy.\nWriting in the Guardian, she said: \u201cWithout urgent action we face the prospect of mass unemployment on a scale not seen since the 1980s.\u201d\nIssuing an appeal to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, she said: \u201cThere is still time to stop mass unemployment. We worked together once before as this crisis began: I will work with you again if you are serious at stemming the haemorrhage of jobs.\u201d\nThe Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, as well as the level of the FTSE 100, to track the impact on jobs and growth from Covid-19 and the measures used to contain it. Faced with the deepest global recession since the 1930s Great Depression, the Covid Crisis watch will also monitor how the UK is faring compared with other countries.\nIn the past month, private sector business activity has risen at the fastest pace in seven years as companies race to catch up on work put on hold during lockdown. The increase in demand for services and manufactured goods, which followed the easing of restrictions during the summer, sent the IHS Markit CIPS flash UK composite output index to 60.3 in August, up from 57 in July. On a scale where a figure above 50 indicates expansion, the latest figures suggest the UK is recovering faster than the US, China and the eurozone.\nThe recovery comes after Britain was officially confirmed to be in the deepest recession since modern records began in the 1950s, with gross domestic product (GDP) falling by 20.4% in the second quarter.\nIn the deepest decline of any nation in the G7 and the EU, the slump was worsened by the later launch of lockdown and prolonged use of controls to limit the spread of the virus. In a reflection of the deeper downturn for Britain, non-essential shops were closed for just 50 days in Germany, compared with 84 days in the UK.\nRetail sales jumped above pre-pandemic levels in July during the first full month since the relaxation of restrictions, as shoppers gradually returned to the high street. The hospitality sector also received a shot in the arm from the \u201ceat out to help out\u201d scheme, with a Monday-to-Wednesday boom at restaurants, pubs and cafes in August. More than 64m discounted meals \u2013 the equivalent of one for almost every person in Britain \u2013 have been claimed by venues taking part in the scheme so far.\nHowever, significant pressure remains for firms, threatening a sharp increase in unemployment this autumn. Online spending remains higher than before the crisis struck, footfall remains down in several big cities amid the continued absence of office workers, and demand remains weak in certain sectors more reliant on social interaction or travel, such as entertainment, aviation and tourism.\nMillions of workers have been brought back from furlough as firms gradually reopen with physical distancing measures in place, with the total number of people on the government\u2019s wage subsidy scheme down from a peak of about 9 million in May to about 4.5 million at the start of August.\nHowever, more than half of the workforce in the arts, entertainment and recreation industry remains furloughed, compared with only 13% still away from work for the economy as a whole, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nDespite the government scheme protecting millions of jobs, official figures show almost three-quarters of a million jobs have been shed from company payrolls since March. Economists say unemployment is set to more than double as the government rolls back the furlough scheme this autumn and as firms cut their costs amid weaker levels of demand while Covid-19 remains a risk to health.\nWarning that the crisis is far from over, O\u2019Grady said employers would need continued government support to protect jobs and create new ones as the risks from the pandemic gradually recede.\n\u201cMass unemployment is not inevitable. If the government acts fast to keep people in work, our economy will recover faster and our country can build back better,\u201d she said.",

If you\u2019ve just bought a new bike, here\u2019s how to lock it up properly.\nDon\u2019t buy an amazing bicycle\nArguably the strongest anti-theft measure going. A carbon frame and wheelset might make for a quick commute, but your bike will be target number one if it\u2019s seen in the same location day after day. Even if it\u2019s locked up like Fort Knox, a thief only has to be handy with an allen key and cable cutter in order to make off with potentially hundreds of pounds worth of components. The crappier your bike appears, the more likely you are to find it where you left it. If there was ever a better excuse for skipping washing your bike at the weekend, this is it.\nUse two locks\nNever lock your bike up with just a cable lock; you\u2019re better off using dental floss. A gold standard D-lock is essential. Stick to brands such as Kryptonite, Oxford, OnGuard or Abus. The Kryptonite Evolution Mini-5 is small enough to be portable but strong enough for quick trips to the shop, park or pub. If you\u2019re leaving a bicycle outside, out of view for longer than an hour, try the Kryptonite Fahgettaboudit or New York Standard. Decent locks are expensive and heavy but thieves would rather go for cheaper, weaker locks. Two D-locks is ideal, but a D-lock with a cable lock for the front wheel should be enough to ensure you return to a bike that\u2019s in one piece. A set of locking security skewers are a good option if you don\u2019t fancy lugging a second lock around with you, and can also be used to secure saddles too.\nLearn how and where to secure your bike\nLock your bike tightly, keeping everything off the ground and leaving no space for power tools, bolt cutters, pry bars or lock pickers. Use your second lock to secure the front wheel to the frame. Leave your bike within eyeshot, among other bikes, somewhere bright and busy where there\u2019s CCTV. Quiet, leafy, posh side streets are never good. Look for dedicated Sheffield stands or cycle hoops. Avoid flimsy racks which only lock the front or rear wheel, wooden posts or trees, and anything your bike can be lifted over. Check whatever you\u2019re locking to hasn\u2019t been cut and covered. (It happens.)\nBring your bike inside\nGoing to a friend\u2019s house? Bring your bike in. Going to the pub? Ask if you can leave your bike out of the way in the beer garden. Your work might have a bike/storage room you can use; if they don\u2019t, petition for one. If you live in a tiny flat, congrats on your new piece of bicycle furniture. Alternatively, ask your council to install secure hangers. This might involve befriending your cycling neighbours and getting them behind your cause.\nPrepare for the worst\nMake a note of your bicycle\u2019s serial number (it\u2019s on the bottom bracket, underneath the bike), take a few pictures and register it on Bike Register and Immobilise. If it\u2019s lost and found you\u2019ll need to prove it\u2019s yours. If it\u2019s stolen, keep an eye on eBay, Gumtree and Facebook Marketplace. Avoid setting up a sting if it does appear \u2013 there\u2019s a chance you\u2019ll be going up against professional bad people and they\u2019ll be far more experienced at this kind of thing than you are. Instead, call the police and let them know you\u2019ve found your bike. Otherwise, bicycle insurance is well worth considering.",

        "content": "The latest in our series of writers highlighting underseen movies is a recommendation for Steve Buscemi\u2019s tough, well-acted prison drama\nSteve Buscemi is one of our most prolific actors (164 credits and counting, according to IMDb), which is perhaps why his directorial output seems so comparatively, frustratingly slender. Though augmented by a fair amount of television (including episodes of both The Sopranos and 30 Rock), he\u2019s helmed only four feature films, the most recent dating clear back to 2007. He began modestly, with an inaugural effort, Trees Lounge, that\u2019s about what you\u2019d expect from the indie stalwart: a seriocomic, Jarmuschian character study, laid-back and intimate.\nHis sophomore film, Animal Factory, is a notable step up, bigger and broader and far more ambitious. Based on the novel by Edward Bunker, who co-starred with Buscemi in Reservoir Dogs, it\u2019s a busy, character-driven take on one of cinema\u2019s most durable genres: the prison picture. The story of a long-timer and a newbie, culminating in an attempted escape, it\u2019s easiest to summarize as The Shawshank Redemption \u2013 minus all the hope and good feeling.\nBunker appears in the film, briefly (like a ghost haunting his own story), co-wrote the screenplay adaptation and is credited as an executive producer \u2013 alongside his pal and protege Danny Trejo, another con turned actor, who plays a supporting role. But the focal character is Ron Decker (Edward Furlong), a new inmate in on a minor drug charge. Luckily, he quickly finds an advocate in Earl (Willem Dafoe, sporting a shaved head and well-worn sneer), the kind of resourceful inside man who can get things, and get things done: \u201cBetter to reign in hell than serve in heaven,\u201d explains this big fish in the prison\u2019s little pond.\n\u201cYou need friends,\u201d Earl tells the newcomer, so he shows Ron the ropes, and imparts pearls of prison wisdom like \u201cInmate\u2019s an insult \u2013 convict\u2019s the term solitudes prefer\u201d and \u201cHalf of knowin\u2019 how to do time is getting\u2019 the right job\u201d.\nRon\u2019s wide-eyed naivety makes him something of an audience surrogate, but Bunker and co-screenwriter John Steppling resist the urge to overwork him as an expositional device; much of their script is about the logistics and routines of prison life, filled with jailhouse lingo and patter (\u201cshow pass\u201d, \u201clay-in\u201d) that\u2019s dropped in and left for the viewer to puzzle out. Bunker also colors the narrative with the kind of details only an insider would know (Earl, needing to pass information while in solitary, communicating with an ally by yelling into a toilet).\n\u201cI\u2019m just not in my element in here, y\u2019know,\u201d Ron moans early on, but the prison eventually breaks him, as it does everyone. Furlong\u2019s work here is subtle but steady, as he catalogs the close calls and self-preservation that create this slow transition from a tourist to, potentially, a lifer. Dafoe makes a good mentor, convincingly putting across Earl\u2019s hard shell, and finding the fleeting moments to let his cracks show. Earl is an honest man, and he admits that the relationship fills a need for him, without explaining what that need is; maybe it\u2019s a public service, or a wish for connection. Or maybe it\u2019s just a desire to be important to another human being.\nBuscemi casts Animal Factory with a carefully cultivated mixture of non-professionals and ace character actors, including Seymour Cassel, John Heard, Mark Boone Junior, Chris Bauer, Mickey Rourke (playing Ron\u2019s trans cellmate with earthy humor and genuine humanity), Tom Arnold (playing against type, wide-eyed and shockingly scary) and Buscemi himself, in a short but welcome appearance as a prison official. What\u2019s striking \u2013 but unsurprising, considering his background \u2013 is how much Buscemi trusts his actors to tell the story implicitly, in pauses, between the lines. He frequently skips dull, obligatory scenes and eschews deadening exposition, letting the emotional narratives of their faces and eyes fill in those blanks.\nBuscemi is clearly fascinated by the carefully controlled politics of a place like this, which runs on an ecosystem of favors, allegiances, respect and retaliation; he also keys in on how the intense racial divisions contribute to an environment where violence can flare up quickly, and at any given moment. His patient, lived-in directorial style sniffs around the joint so thoroughly and convincingly that it feels like the viewer knows where everything is, and how everything works; it\u2019s tempting to say one could make their way in this facility by the film\u2019s end, but who are we kidding? Earlier this year, Ellen DeGeneres fueled one of several backlashes by comparing self-quarantine to prison. If Animal Factory does nothing else, it makes abundantly clear that the prison experience is, well, nothing like that.\nAnimal Factory is available to stream on Amazon Prime in the US and UK",

        "content": "Revenues plunge by 61%, with Covid-19 continuing to take toll on aviation industry\nGatwick airport has reported a \u00a3343m pre-tax loss after passenger numbers plummeted by two-thirds in the first half of the year, as the coronavirus takes a heavy toll on the aviation industry.\nBritain\u2019s second-busiest air hub, which earlier this week announced plans to cut 600 jobs, said revenues had plunged by 61% in the first half from \u00a3372m to \u00a3144m.\nGatwick is operating flights from only one of its two terminals and said passenger numbers had fallen by two-thirds year on year in the first six months, from 22 million to only 7.5 million. The airport is forecasting it will take four to five years for air traffic levels to return to pre-pandemic levels.\n\u201cThe negative impact of Covid-19 on our passenger numbers and air traffic at the start of the year was dramatic and, although there are small signs of recovery, it is a trend we expect to continue to see,\u201d said Stewart Wingate, the chief executive of Gatwick airport. \u201cAs with any responsible company we have protected our financial resilience by significantly reducing our operational costs and capital expenditure.\u201d\nThe company, which said passenger numbers were down 80% year on year this month, is slashing capital expenditure by more than \u00a3300m over the next two years and has cut costs by in excess of \u00a3100m. More than 70% of staff remain on furlough.\nGatwick\u2019s dire results come as Norwegian, traditionally one of the airport\u2019s four biggest customers, reported a $610m (\u00a3459.1m) first-half loss and warned that it needed another cash injection.\nNorwegian, Europe\u2019s third-largest low-cost airline, said passenger numbers had dropped 99% in the second quarter. The airline, which already has a $340m loan guarantee from the Norwegian government, said it would not be enough to get it through the crisis.\nRoyal Schiphol Group, the operator of airports in the Netherlands, is to cut several hundred jobs after reporting a \u20ac246m (\u00a3220.6m) loss in the first half. The state-owned group, which employs 3,000 staff, said passenger traffic had declined 62% year on year in the period. RSG, which operates airports in Rotterdam, The Hague and Eindhoven, is seeking to cut costs by 25% by 2022.\nIn April, British Airways said it planned to drastically cut back its operation at Gatwick as part of a plan to make 12,000 redundancies.\nLast month, Heathrow airport reported a \u00a31bn loss in the first half as passenger numbers fell by 96% in the second quarter. John Holland-Kaye, the airport\u2019s chief executive, accused the government of playing \u201cquarantine roulette\u201d by failing to introduce a passenger testing regime at the UK\u2019s major entry points.\nWingate said the government needed to look at adopting the policies of some other European countries that have seen air travel pick up faster because they are not making snap decisions to introduce quarantines.\n\u201cThe way other countries are operating seems to have led to more activity at their airports,\u201d he said. \u201cShould we just be using the infection rate \u2013 20 per 100,000 people \u2013 [as the threshold to introduce quarantine measures] or should we also be looking at things like hospitalisation rates?\n\u201cWe want to work with government to see if there are other factors that should be taken into account to make the decision to open or close the travel corridors. Can we make better decisions by broadening the data set we use?\u201d",

        "content": "When I boycotted the 1968 Olympics because of racial inequality I was ostracized. Now white athletes are joining their black teammates in protests\nDo you want to know what it feels like to be black in America this week? Think about Survivor, or Naked and Afraid, or Alone \u2013 or any of those wilderness shows in which a person\u2019s survival in a hostile environment depends on keeping that crucial campfire burning bright. Inevitably, some disaster occurs and the fire nearly goes out. Then, on their hands and knees, the person tries desperately to fan one dying ember back to life.\nFor the African American community living in a hostile environment, that dying ember is hope. Hope that America was finally committed to racial equity. Hope that being black wasn\u2019t a crime and the punishment wasn\u2019t death. The popularity of the Black Lives Matter movement that swept through America this summer after the killings of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd stoked that hope inside us into a small but powerful sun.\nThen this week, a black man, Jacob Blake, was shot seven times in the back by police, a 17-year-old was charged with intentional homicide after two men were killed at a subsequent protests, and the Republican National Convention featured speakers who, instead of voicing outrage over systemic racism and vowing to end it, complained about the audacity of ungrateful black people protesting that their husbands, sons, daughters, mothers, fathers, sisters, and brothers were being murdered by police while President Trump and the GOP conspired to take away their right to vote.\nYeah, hope in the black community took a big hit this week. The small sun set quickly. The dying ember had been extinguished.\nBut then along came the Milwaukee Bucks, my old team, who announced they would boycott Game 5 of the NBA playoffs, explaining, \u201cDespite the overwhelming plea for change, there has been no action, so our focus today cannot be on basketball.\u201d They demanded that the Wisconsin state legislature, after months of inaction, \u201ctake up meaningful measures to address issues of police accountability, brutality and criminal justice reform.\u201d And just like that, the ember of hope was flickering to life again.\nOther NBA and WNBA teams followed. Games were postponed. That both leagues spoke out immediately was courageous, especially given the hundreds of millions of dollars involved and all the expense and effort it took to create their sports bubbles. But it wasn\u2019t that great of surprise because 81.1% of the NBA and 88% of the WNBA are black and their families and friends don\u2019t live in a protective bubble.\nAs LeBron James explained, \u201cI know people get tired of hearing me say it, but we are scared as black people in America. Black men, black women, black kids, we are terrified.\u201d As tired as white people may be of hearing it, black people are even more tired of living it.\nFor me, what really brought the hearth fire of hope back to life was the instantaneous support of other sports teams and athletes. Major League Soccer, in which only 26% of players are black, postponed five games that day, with players from two teams, Inter Miami and Atlanta United, locking arms and refusing to play. Major League Baseball, with only about 8% African American players, also joined in with players from the Milwaukee Brewers and Cincinnati Reds sitting out their games and the Seattle Mariners voted unanimously to postpone their Wednesday game. More baseball teams joined the boycott on Thursday.\nIn tennis, perhaps the whitest of all the sports, former US Open champion Naomi Osaka walked away from her semi-final match at the Western & Southern Open on Thursday, tweeting, \u201cI don\u2019t expect anything drastic to happen with me not playing, but if I can get a conversation started in a majority white sport I consider that a step in the right direction.\u201d Professional tennis organizations USTA, ATP, and WTA issued a statement in support of her stance and postponed tournament play on Thursday. I have never been prouder of my athlete colleagues.\nIn the past, these mostly white sports would have taken days, even weeks, to respond, let alone join in any form of protest, especially boycotting games. When I boycotted the 1968 Olympics because of the gross racial inequities, I was met with a vicious backlash criticizing my lack of gratitude for being invited into the air-conditioned Big House where I could comfortably watch my community swelter and suffer.\nFor those who think this isn\u2019t personal for elite athletes because they are highly paid, read Sterling Brown\u2019s story in the Players\u2019 Tribune in which he describes being confronted by police over a parking violation in 2018 that resulted in them using a stun gun on him and one officer stepping on his career-dependent ankle. Body camera video shows the police worrying about the publicity of what they\u2019ve done, then calling their commander to inquire about receiving overtime pay while one officer sings the \u201cmoney, money\u201d lyric from the O\u2019Jays\u2019 For the Love of Money. What amusing scamps the police can be.\nOur work is not done because, as we see on nearly a weekly basis, the threat to black lives is real and imminent. The Kenosha police have been recorded giving water to the armed civilians, many from out of town, who roamed the streets during the protests, telling them, \u201cWe appreciate you guys. We really do.\u201d One of those appreciated was the 17-year-old kid who has been charged with killing two protestors.\nThe threat is exacerbated by the GOP, who have made it their mission to equate protestors with looters in order to dismiss their proven concerns. In his keynote speech at the RNC, vice-president Mike Pence commented that \u201cin the midst of this global pandemic ... we\u2019ve seen violence and chaos in the streets of our major cities.\u201d He\u2019s right. But it\u2019s been caused by the kind of racism the Trump administration has promoted.\nIn Pence\u2019s speech, he told America: \u201cDave Patrick Underwood was an officer of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Federal Protective Service, who was shot and killed during the riots in Oakland, California.\u201d What he neglected to mention was that federal authorities say Underwood was killed by Steven Carrillo, an Air Force staff sergeant who was a member of a right-wing extremist group whose purpose is to start a race war.\nIt\u2019s Los Angeles Clippers coach Doc Rivers who so powerfully expressed the feelings of most African Americans, myself included. Both our fathers were police officers, which we are proud of, though we cringe at how the systemic racism in police departments across the county tarnishes their accomplishments. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing why we keep loving this country, and this country does not love us back,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cIt\u2019s really so sad ... I\u2019m so often reminded of my color \u2026 We got to do better. But we got to demand better.\u201d\nThis week American athletes demanded better. And rekindled our hope in America.",

The star is Mark Dacascos, erstwhile straight-to-video stalwart aiming to convert his nifty John Wick 3 cameo into a second leading-man career. Behind the camera is Wych Kaosayananda, formerly just Kaos, the wildly overhyped Thai tyro exported at the height of Hollywood\u2019s millennial Asian-cinema fetish to oversee megaflop Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever in 2002.\nHis latest is a baby step up from that \u2013 cheap, self-produced tat being preferable to aggressively expensive corporate tat \u2013 but still feels underpowered. Ironically, it\u2019s the kind of B pic a studio would have bulked up, cut tighter and transformed into a halfway worthy rental prospect.\nThe pitch would be Collateral updated for the age of Uber; it plays, alas, like Collateral with the handbrake on. Dacascos\u2019s Kai is the mysterious stranger with a score to settle who jets into Bangkok at 4pm, hails the cab of fresh-faced Fha (Vanida Golten) and spends the next 12 hours shooting people clean through the forehead.\nUnusually for an action movie, there\u2019s next to no real action for an hour: the plot sets Kai in front of his targets, and \u2013 pop \u2013 off we drive to the next location. We\u2019re left with all the lowish-octane thrills that follow from watching a man ticking items off his to-do list, and Kaosayananda makes such a deathly plod of it that vast stretches appear to be proceeding in real time.\nAlways one of the more likable DTV stars, Dacascos brings a supermarket own-brand appropriation of Keanu\u2019s Zen chivalry to Kai\u2019s task; we just about buy why Fha doesn\u2019t kick him out after he starts bleeding all over her back seat. His future employment isn\u2019t in doubt.\nHowever, bigger question marks hang over Kaos. He gives the Bangkok sights a basic nocturnal sheen \u2013 even reviving the kind of strip-joint safari we all thought went out with the demise of Nuts magazine \u2013 but also floods scenes with the deadest of dead air in a vain push for atmosphere, and seems to think two negligibly different angles of the same dull shot will make for a dynamic, DePalma-like split screen. Stick to the Murray Head song.",

        "content": "The video-sharing app has 800 million users, many of them conscious young eco-influencers campaigning on issues from climate change to biodiversity\nPhilip Aiken has received more than 1.4m likes on the video-sharing app TikTok. But his videos don\u2019t feature cute animals and there are no celebrities to be seen. Aiken\u2019s posts are about soil restoration.\nThe 27-year-old is one of a growing number of TikTok users discussing the benefits of boosting biodiversity in green spaces and gardens against a backdrop of viral sounds. \u201cI see it as like planting seeds, and hopefully that germinates and that person wants to learn more,\u201d says Aiken, known as Phil the Fixer on TikTok.\n Millennials and Generation Z are increasingly engaging with environmental issues by creating and sharing memes on social media. The hashtags \u201cmoss\u201d, \u201cbiodiversity\u201d and \u201cnative biodiversity\u201d have 84.3 million, 12.6 million and nearly 800,000 views respectively on TikTok.\nThe most-viewed biodiversity TikToks poke fun at monoculture lawns, praise the qualities of moss, provide explainers, support indigenous practices and warn of mass extinction. TikTok has around 800m active users worldwide and is particularly popular with Generation Z: an estimated 60% of users were born after the mid-90s. The images and clips go on to reach new audiences when reposted on Twitter and Facebook.\nA subculture known as \u201cgrass TikTok\u201d \u2013 which has gathered nearly 380 million views \u2013 has also emerged on the app. Its community interacts with content about plant species. Top creator Evan Phillips, who has more than half a million followers, rates different types of grass and posts pictures of fans\u2019 gardens; he has even brought out grass-themed merchandise.\nAiken downloaded the app in October 2019 after interviewing a group of youth climate activists \u2013 who were all talking about TikTok \u2013 for his podcast just to save the world.\nHe regularly receives messages asking about gardening, sustainability and university degree choices, while others exchange resource recommendations in his comments section. Aiken, who is based in the US but studied for a master\u2019s in renewable energy in New Zealand, hopes to become a teacher. \u201cIt\u2019s been cool being able to influence the younger generation in that way,\u201d he says.During lockdown, Aiken also co-founded EcoTok, a collective of young creators aiming to become the environmental \u201cHype House\u201d (a group of the biggest stars on the app who live and film in a mansion in Los Angeles), as well as the Intersectional Environmentalist Instagram account, which was initially set up after a post by environmental activist Leah Thomas in response to the killing of George Floyd went viral. The Intersectional Environmentalist, which campaigns for an inclusive version of environmentalism, highlighting injustices experienced by marginalised communities, has now gained 121,000 followers, with an audience mainly made up of millennials.\n  Young-Woong Kee, a 16-year-old Hawaiian high school student, is a keen follower of biodiversity TikToks: \u201cSeeing them and talking about them with my friends has definitely impacted us and made us want to look more into it.\u201d\nHe has acquired a collection of succulents and hopes other viewers will look more deeply into wider environmental issues. Kee, who has also started watching National Geographic\u2019s YouTube videos and the Netflix documentary series Our Planet, cited coral bleaching, deforestation and overhunting as key issues.\n  A recent survey of Generation Z and millennials by Deloitte found climate change and protecting the environment was a top concern, both before and during the coronavirus pandemic. This follows the rise to prominence of Greta Thunberg and the growth of Fridays for Future, Zero Hour and Extinction Rebellion over recent years.\nAnother EcoTok creator, Casey Shultis, 18, believes lockdown has further increased engagement. \u201cPeople are sitting at home and now have the time to learn more about biodiversity and the environmental crisis,\u201d he says. \u201cI encourage people to understand the importance of planting native biodiversity while also seeing the beauty that comes along with it.\u201d\nShultis, who is about to start an environmental studies degree in the US, previously called his 62,300 TikTok followers the Greta Gang and hopes one day to have as much impact as Thunberg.\nAn Xiao Mina, author of the book Memes to Movements, says the full extent of the influence of these platforms will only become apparent by tracking the digital content over time. She highlighted the influence of, for example, #BlackLivesMatter and the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong. \u201cOften, the most visible thing is the meme,\u201d says Mina. \u201cWhat may not be apparent is the networks that are being built, the narratives being shaped and the organisational structures that ultimately might help us yield effective change.\u201d\nEducators have also been using biodiversity memes to get their messages across in the classroom and lecture halls, while environmental organisations have been attempting to inspire younger audiences on social media, which can ensure the accuracy of information shared. The Royal Horticultural Society\u2019s (RHS) Instagram following grew from 99,500 to 125,000 between April and June. Prof Alistair Griffiths, RHS Director of Science and Collections, says: \u201cIt would be wonderful if there were a way for RHS scientific content to be co-created with the key environmental influencers of TikTok.\u201d\nHowever, the potential ban on TikTok in the US over national security concerns looms over creators, and could result in a loss of biodiversity engagement online.\n\u201cIt would be really unfortunate because TikTok is such a unique platform,\u201d says Aiken. \u201cPeople are genuinely learning things they never learned in school or from their communities.\u201d But he remains optimistic. \u201cThere\u2019s something different about Gen Z. I don\u2019t necessarily think that\u2019s gonna go away with TikTok.\u201d\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

        "content": "The flanker endured 18 months of injuries but vowed to return stronger, and recent displays may earn him an England call-up\nLife as an English flanker can be precarious. Just last week Jack Clifford \u2013 the first player to turn the head of Eddie Jones \u2013 announced his retirement at the age of 27, the countless injuries too much to bear. Sam Jones is another whose career was ended in his prime and there were undoubtedly occasions during Jack Willis\u2019 18 months of injury hell when he pondered whether his time was up.\nWillis \u2013 who was captained by Sam Jones at Wasps \u2013 was part of what he calls \u201cthe knee gang\u201d after suffering a hideous injury in the 2018 Premiership semi-final against Saracens, just days after being first named in an England squad for the summer tour of South Africa. The other gang members were Jimmy Gopperth, Marcus Garratt and Alex Reider; the latter two have also since retired.\nWillis even enrolled in a plumbing course with his brother and club-mate Tom, such was the brutal realisation that those who call time on their own terms are the fortunate ones. The 23-year-old not only suffered knee and ankle injuries that kept him out for 10 months, but another ankle problem after just a couple of matches back sidelined him for a further eight.\nIt is to his immense credit then, that after slowly returning to action around the turn of the year, he has emerged as one of the form players since the Premiership restart. Talk a player up enough and Jones will seemingly find a reason not to pick them, but it is unlikely to be coincidence that the England head coach has watched both of Willis\u2019s appearances this month \u2013 the latter involving a back-and-forth tussle with Ben Curry, another who is hopeful of Test recognition this autumn.\nWillis has dreamed of representing England since he was a young lad and it is easy to wonder how many caps he may have accrued had those debilitating injuries not occurred. His head coach at Wasps, Lee Blackett, sees it as a matter of if, not when, and Jones often takes a liking to players who have overcome adversity.\n\u201cAt the beginning of my rehab I started to put a bit of pressure on myself to make sure I came back at the same level,\u201d Willis says. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard one to put that pressure on yourself \u2013 you may not be coming back as the same player, you\u2019re coming back and remodelling your body, you move in a different way.\n\u201cIt was looking at my wider game and the closer I got to coming back I thought I didn\u2019t want to come back as the same player, I wanted to improve on the areas I wasn\u2019t good enough in, anything I was doing well try and do it even better,\u201d he adds. \u201cThere\u2019s always a constant improvement to become a better player, whether that\u2019s coming back from injury or on a day-to-day basis reviewing a game. Constant improvement is something I strive for.\u201d\nBlackett agrees, describing Willis as the one member of his squad most likely to be picking the brains of his coaches after training, always looking for an extra edge. A menace at the breakdown, the new interpretations \u2013 designed to protect players such as Willis as much as they have been to speed the game up \u2013 play to his strengths. Blackett believes he could well be the best \u2018jackaller\u2019 in the Premiership and he has already reached double figures in the try-scoring charts.\n\u201cLet\u2019s not forget Jack was getting turnovers before [the new interpretations]. He just found a way beforehand. So it\u2019s only going to help him,\u201d says Blackett. \u201cHe is really aggressive in his mindset, breakdown-wise he is proving himself to be one of the best in the Premiership \u2013 if not the best.\u201d\nDespite his return to the field, the plumbing has not dried up for Willis either \u2013 he fitted a tap in his parents\u2019 kitchen recently \u2013 and both brothers will learn the results of their diploma course next month. He has also started a property business, RockCap, with Alex Lundberg, another former Wasps teammate who was forced into early retirement through injury.\n\u201cIt probably did hit home a bit when I had the injury that rugby is not going to last forever and to have something outside of it is going to be crucial,\u201d adds Willis. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to have that other focus, I put everything into my training when I\u2019m here, put my work in, my analysis after training \u2013 but once that is done it\u2019s nice to get home, put the business hat on and have that other focus.\u201d",

This is Mostafa Rachwani and it\u2019s Friday 28 August.\nThe federal aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, has continued to face scrutiny over the government\u2019s handling of aged care during the pandemic. The senator has been criticised for the tragic failings in the sector, at one point appearing to turn his back on questions from the Senate floor.\nMore than 350 aged care residents have died because of the virus, with Labour pursuing the government on the matter when parliament resumed this week.\nThis came after the royal commission blasted the Morrison government for failing to establish independent monitoring and reporting.\nThe Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said in a speech at the National Press Club on Thursday that the sector would need \u201cstructural changes\u201d and pointed the blame at for-profit care \u2013 but stopped short of saying Labor would end the practice.\nThe Victorian chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, said daily case numbers were \u201cclearly trending in the right direction\u201d but he did not expect the figures to drop below 100 until next week.\nCase numbers have fallen to their lowest point since July, with 113 new cases reported on both Thursday and Friday. The state\u2019s death toll now stands at 496, with all 12 deaths on Thursday linked to aged care.\nThe premier, Daniel Andrews, has yet to outline how the state will ease its lockdown, with restrictions due to expire on 13 September, instead saying the plan will be dependent on the data at the time.\nMelbourne\u2019s hotel quarantine inquiry continued this week, with details emerging of poor behaviour from security guards and of senior officials saying police should have taken a leading role.\nThe inquiry, which began last week, heard of security guards re-using personal protective equipment, \u201chitting on\u201d staff, slipping notes under guests\u2019 doors and intimidating nurses during the program. The inquiry has also heard of concerns from guests about a lack of food and the cleanliness of their rooms.\nThis comes as a senior staff member at the Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions revealed that state authorities had advised against the use of masks and gloves among hotel staff to conserve PPE.\nShe also outlined that the decision to use private security companies \u2013 a key focus on the inquiry \u2013 was presented as a \u201cfait accompli\u201d. She said Victoria police had \u201cpreferred\u201d that private security guards acted as the \u201cfirst line of security\u201d.\nThe Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has announced that schoolies \u2013 the huge end-of-school celebrations on the Gold Coast \u2013 would be cancelled.\nThe annual bonanza, a right of passage for many high school students, usually attracts thousands of revellers but in 2020 the risk is too high for the state government. Palaszczuk encouraged high school students to still book a holiday with friends but to make it a quiet affair.\nThe announcement came as the state\u2019s number of active cases rose to 20. The state has introduced limits on people living in the Gold Coast, including restricting the number of people allowed to gather to 10 people.\nAustralian church leaders raised questions about the government\u2019s decision to enter a deal with the University of Oxford to provide Australia with its potential Covid-19 vaccine, if it clears trials.\nThe religious objections centred on the use of cell-lines from an \u201celectively aborted human foetus\u201d and were outlined in a letter to the prime minister, cosigned by the Catholic archbishop of Sydney, Anthony Fisher, the Anglican archbishop of Sydney, Glenn Davies, and the Greek Orthodox archbishop of Australia, Makarios Griniezakis.\nThe cell-line in question is a well-known cellular \u201cworkhorse\u201d and has been used for medical research and vaccine development for decades.\nThe prime minister rebuffed the church leaders\u2019 objections on Friday, saying on 2SM radio that the cells were cloned from those extracted from the original cell-line. Scott Morrison, a practising Christian, also went on record saying he and his family would be taking the vaccine.\nFinally, Tasmania has extended its state of emergency until the end of October. The current state of emergency was due to expire on Sunday, but the premier, Peter Gutwein, announced the extension on Friday, citing the advice of state health authorities.\nLooking for more coverage?

Plus, 17-year-old charged with murder after two shot dead at Kenosha protests over police brutality \nGood morning.\nDonald Trump formally accepted the Republican presidential nomination last night, in a whopping 70-minute acceptance speech in which he peddled the dominant message of the Republican National Convention (RNC) \u2013 that Joe Biden was a danger to America. However, for the first time this election season, the president also shared his policy ideas, which ranged from creating more jobs to landing a woman on the moon.\nSpeaking at a rally of 1,500 people at the White House, where social distancing and mask-wearing were not enforced, Trump ignored criticism of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and claimed Biden would have led to \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d further US deaths. His speech built the perception that coronavirus was over, despite more people having died from it during this week\u2019s RNC than in the 9/11 attacks. The rally\u2019s format also raised further questions over the ethical and legal implications of holding a political rally at an official site.\nDespite its focus on law and order, Trump\u2019s speech also largely ignored the anti-racism protests that have swept across the US in recent months. Just one speaker mentioned Jacob Blake, the black man left paralysed after police shot him several times in front of his children on Sunday, while others focused on the \u201cviolent anarchists\u201d demonstrating against racism.\n\u2018Donald Trump has failed\u2019: Hours before he took to the stage, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris issued a scathing attack on Trump, saying: \u201cThe Republican convention is designed for one purpose: to soothe Donald Trump\u2019s ego, to make him feel good.\u201d\nThe US coronavirus death toll passed 180,000, despite little mention of the pandemic at the RNC.\nSeventeen-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse was charged with first degree murder yesterday, after two men were shot dead on Tuesday at demonstrations against the shooting of Jacob Blake. However, police faced questions of their own over their interactions with Rittenhouse, after witness reports and videos appeared to show police letting the gunman walk past them while crowds call for his arrest.\nOnline support for Rittenhouse remains widespread, with Facebook criticised for allowing fundraisers and praise for the alleged gunman to be shared widely. Earlier this week, the company said it was working to ban content that supports mass shooters, but one fundraiser has been shared almost 18,000 times.\nRittenhouse\u2019s alleged victims were identified yesterday as a father and a 26-year-old skateboarder. A third victim, 26-year-old Gaige Grosskreutz, who is recovering in hospital, had reportedly volunteered as a medic at Black Lives Matter protests this summer, and may have been volunteering while he was shot.\nSix people have died in Louisiana after Hurricane Laura battered the state, including a 14-year-old girl who died when a tree fell on her home. The hurricane made landfall on Thursday on a northerly path with wind speeds of 150mph, with forecasters warning of \u201ccatastrophic conditions\u201d still to come.\nIt wasn\u2019t until 11 hours after landfall that the hurricane finally weakened and was downgraded to tropical storm status, with maximum wind speeds of 40mph and heavy rainfall. While fears of a 20ft storm surge were avoided as the hurricane moved further east, the storm left nearly 900,000 people without power, with power shortages and trees collapsing as far as Arkansas.\n\u201cThere\u2019s devastation everywhere\u201d: Lake Charles was one of the areas most severely hit by Hurricane Laura.

The shock announcement came after a chronic bowel condition left him unable to lead the country through the coronavirus pandemic, despite officials earlier insisting he would finish his term in September 2021.\nThe risk of severe illness and death to children from Covid-19 is extremely small, according to a study of two-thirds of all patients admitted to hospitals across England, Scotland and Wales with coronavirus.\nWalmart has partnered with Microsoft in a bid to take over the US operations of TikTok, following Trump\u2019s ultimatum that the popular app\u2019s Beijing-based parent company had to sell its US business to an American company or face being shut down.\nHow TikTok could save the planet\nThe video sharing app, which boasts 800 million users, has seen a rise in discussion of biodiversity and sustainability.

        "content": "Armed rightwingers have attacked leftwing protesters and reporters, supplanting the nightly standoffs with police\nOver the last three months in Portland, mass protests against police violence and racism gradually gave way to nightly often violent standoffs between a core of pro-Black Lives Matter and anti-fascist protesters and law enforcement.\nBut in the past week the city has fallen back into a pattern of more politically polarized street violence which has marked the city throughout the Trump era, with broadly leftwing and anti-fascist activists sometimes facing off against far-right groups.\nLast weekend a rightwing \u201cSay no to Marxism in America\u201d rally saw serious, widespread violence. Much of it came from rally attendees \u2013 who included members of far-right groups like the Proud Boys \u2013 and was directed not only at leftist counter-protesters, but also reporters.\nOne rightwing protester drew a firearm on opposing protesters. Earlier, he had fired a paintball gun into the crowd, and a local journalist was caught in the crossfire. Others appeared to be armed with firearms and knives. Some carried wooden shields with nails driven through them.\nOne pro-Trump protester took to a snack van with a baseball bat. Others joined in and destroyed the vehicle.\nNear the peak of Saturday\u2019s violence, a reporter\u2019s hand was broken by a rightwing protester with a baton, and video of the incident went viral on social media. That reporter, Robert Evans, has been covering the protests since they began, for Bellingcat and other outlets.\nThat assailant was identified by Bellingcat on Tuesday as Travis Taylor, a Portland-based Proud Boy who has been previously observed attending violent street demonstrations in the city.\nIn a telephone conversation, Evans told the Guardian that the rightwing demonstrators \u201cabsolutely came prepared to fight\u201d, were \u201cvery aggressive from the jump\u201d and were equipped with \u201cknives, guns, paintball guns with frozen pellets, batons\u201d.\nNeither the Portland police bureau (PPB) nor the Multnomah county district attorney (MCDA) responded to questions about whether Taylor would be charged or prosecuted over the incident.\nIt was the worst violence of its kind in the city since an infamous afternoon in 2018, also involving Proud Boys, who came from all over the country to attend a rally that culminated in another vicious street brawl.\nBut as that precedent indicates, the polarized violence was not so much a new development linked to the massive anti-racism protests that have continued around the US, as a return to the dynamic that has afflicted Portland since the election of Donald Trump.\nFrom 2017 to 2019, the city was a magnet for street protesters and street fighters from groups like Patriot Prayer and the Proud Boys, who were regularly met by antifascist counter-protesters.\nAt rallies in 2018 and 2019 hundreds of rightwingers from all around the country descended on Portland, and rightwing media and e-celebrities worked hard to identify the city with \u201cantifa\u201d, a movement that conservatives from Trump down have sought to demonize.\nThroughout this period, PPB were regularly accused by protesters and media outlets of heavy-handed, one-sided enforcement.\nThis year, however, as the Black Lives Matter protests sprang up in Portland, members of far-right groups had not been a significant factor during an unbroken 85-night streak of protests. Instead the focus of many protesters was the presence of federal agents in the city \u2013 which became a national scandal as local elected officials sought to force the Trump administration to withdraw them.\nMainstream media attention was then diverted after the apparent resolution of the conflict over the unwanted presence of federal agents. But now the renewed presence of rightwing groups in the city has some fearing the fresh violence will continue, especially because activists say the PBB has a record of not intervening to prevent rightwing violence.\nAmy Herzfeld-Copple, the deputy director of Portland-based progressive non-profit, the Western States Center, wrote in an email that: \u201cPortland police allowed alt-right and paramilitary groups to sow chaos and deploy violence against the community with apparent impunity.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cThere\u2019s a real risk that protests for racial justice and police reform will be subsumed by alt-right mayhem if city leadership doesn\u2019t change its approach.\u201d\nThe office of Portland\u2019s mayor, Ted Wheeler, did not directly respond on Monday to questions on last weekend\u2019s violent events.\nNot all locals blame PPB for the violence.\nJames Buchal, chair of the Multnomah county Republican party, wrote in an email that \u201cas Republicans, we condemn the cowardly and totalitarian attacks on the pro-police demonstrators\u201d by leftist demonstrators.\nAnd not all locals consider the confrontation with far-right groups to be a distraction from the cause of protesting against police brutality against Black communities.\nA spokesperson for Rose City Antifa, a long-established local anti-fascist network which has supported the protests downtown, wrote in an email: \u201cPolice brutality and white nationalist organizing are two sides of the same coin, and they should be addressed as such.\u201d",

But our kids loved it from the start. My son Joseph promptly built grandpa a Lego replica of the White House. The president still displays it on the mantel in the Oval Office and shows it to world leaders, just so they know he has the greatest grandchildren on earth.\u201d\nPeople observed the similarity to a story that Ivanka Trump had told previously about herself. Andrea Bernstein, a WNYC reporter who wrote the book American Oligarchs about the Trumps, noted that in 2007 Ivanka said she had once made a Lego model of Trump Tower for her father, only to have it criticised by him several days later because it wasn\u2019t accurate enough. Bernstein also cast doubt about the veracity of the earlier story.\nOMG, Ivanka is telling a story about her son Joseph building a lego model of the White House. She told the same story about herself once, building a lego Trump Tower. The story was made up.  AMERICAN OLIGARCHS, P 176 pic.twitter.com/hwGR2q43Q1\nThere is, however, photographic evidence that, as recently as March 2019 at least, there was a Lego model of the White House in the White House.\nAnd the president has even posed with it.\nI absolutely cannot believe that reporters are really trying to cast doubt on the validity of a 6 year old\u2019s gift to his grandfather. Be better. https://t.co/t3qIh9rWTo pic.twitter.com/uL42qJjpg1\nIt doesn\u2019t look to be the official Lego replica of the White House available as part of its Architecture series, aimed more at adults than children. Although there is a previous smaller Lego version of the White House which it resembles. The model is slightly out of date, as it does not feature Melania Trump\u2019s much-maligned remodelled rose garden.\nThe first lady also had her social media moment in the spotlight on the final night of the convention, wearing a dress that easily allowed her to be \u201cgreen-screened\u201d. The internet soon went to work and before long she appeared variously to be endorsing Joe Biden, the nation\u2019s coronavirus death toll, and the weather.\nEveryone will be talking about Melania's dress after this is all over. #RNC2020 pic.twitter.com/KosqGenMwc\nGorgeous dress pic.twitter.com/JV0Da0RLrU\n pic.twitter.com/rLyKJJHonF\nIf there were an award for awkward moment of the night, it would have to go to this exchange between Ivanka and Melania Trump.

        "content": "The one-off 50-over competition is a relief to those who feared no cricket this summer and showcases a new elite structure\nThe new elite women\u2019s domestic structure which replaces county cricket officially gets off the ground on Saturday, with the first round of matches taking place in the one-off 50-over Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy.\nThe Trophy is being contested by the eight new regional women\u2019s teams which broadly align geographically with the Hundred sides, and which are formed of conglomerations of counties. While six of the regional team names have carried over from the Kia Super League \u2013 including Western Storm (which covers the south-west and Wales), Southern Vipers (Hampshire and Sussex), South East Stars (Surrey and Kent), Lightning (which covers the east Midlands), Thunder (Lancashire, Cheshire and Cumbria) and Northern Diamonds (Yorkshire, Durham and Northumberland) \u2013 two are brand new. The West Midlands side which will feature players from Warwickshire and Worcestershire, for example, will be known as the Central Sparks.\nThe eight teams \u2013 split into a North group and a South group \u2013 will each be in action twice across the bank holiday weekend, going on to play in four further matches, with the top team in each group progressing to a final at Edgbaston on 27 September, which will be televised live on Sky Sports. The matches are all taking place behind closed doors at first-class men\u2019s county grounds, with action on Saturday at Chelmsford, Edgbaston, Trent Bridge and Beckenham.\nWhile the England players will be available for the first two rounds before re-entering a separate biosecure bubble for their series against West Indies, the competition is being viewed largely as a development opportunity for younger, less-established players to make their mark \u2013 a sentiment echoed by Trevor Griffin, head coach of the new Sunrisers team, which is based at Lord\u2019s and covers Middlesex, Essex and Northamptonshire.\nGriffin, who previously won the KSL twice as head coach of Western Storm, said: \u201cIf we go back to March, there was real concern that we wouldn\u2019t see any cricket at all. It\u2019s a real bonus.\n\u201cI want to focus on building the future of the Sunrisers, and developing these players ready for full competition next year. This [new setup] gives me the opportunity to work with players all year round. A lot of these players have got ambitions to play for England and this is an opportunity to help them achieve that.\u201d\nWhile the competition is a one-off, designed to allow the teams a chance to play competitive cricket despite Covid-19 disruptions, the new regional set-up is a permanent move away from the now defunct Women\u2019s County Championship and is aimed at professionalising the domestic structure. Twenty-five of the players across the eight squads are currently on professional \u201cretainer\u201d contracts, with 15 more to be added to the payroll in October. All players are being paid match fees to participate.\nThe establishment of the new structure has been overseen by eight regional directors of women\u2019s cricket, who were appointed pre-lockdown but have had to move at speed in recent weeks to ensure that their sides have full cohorts of coaching staff in place before the competition commences. Many of those involved have long pedigrees in the women\u2019s game: Laura MacLeod, who represented England between 1997 and 2007, is the regional director of the Sparks, while the former England captain Charlotte Edwards has taken up the mantle as head coach of Southern Vipers.\nThe competition has been named in honour of one of the pioneers of women\u2019s cricket, the former England captain Heyhoe Flint, who died in 2017. She was the driving force behind the first Women\u2019s Cricket World Cup in 1973 and went on to lead a successful campaign for women\u2019s admission to membership of the MCC in the 1990s.",

Visitors who choose to sleep outdoors receive stern warnings from the authorities that people must carry firearms when moving outside settlements.\nThe last death from a polar bear encounter in Svalbard happened in 2011 when Horatio Chapple, a 17-year-old boy from Salisbury, south-west England, was killed at a campsite while on a trip organised by the British Schools Exploring Society.\nIn 2015, a polar bear dragged a Czech tourist out of his tent as he and others were camping north of Longyearbyen, clawing his back before being driven away by gunshots.\nAccording to a spokesperson for the Svalbard governor\u2019s office: \u201cPolice were notified at 3.50am that a person at the campsite had been attacked and injured by a polar bear. The bear was shot at by people on the spot and walked towards the airport, which is located nearby,\u201d said the assistant governor S\u00f8lvi Elvedahl.\nElvedahl said it was not clear if a guard against bears had been stationed at the campsite. \u201cIt will be part of the investigation. We are in bear territory, and polar bears are a danger to humans.\u201d\nSix other people were staying in tents at the campsite when the attack took place. According to NRK, the campsite does not allow guests to have firearms on the site and does not advise bear alarms or the use of flares as bear deterrents during the summer season when bear approaches are less frequent.\nThe campsite\u2019s owner, it emerged, had recently purchased electric bear fencing to protect the site.\nThe attack took place amid several recent sightings of bears around Svalbard. A female bear with young was darted and moved, while on Tuesday night two bears were observed near Longyearbyen.\nAccording to the local paper Svalbardposten, researchers at the local university field centre, Unis, avoid spending the night in tents near the shoreline \u2013 where the campsite is located \u2013 because of a recent increase in the presence of polar bears.\nThis week, there are thought to be more than 200 overnight visitors in hotels and guesthouses on Svalbard.",

        "content": "Lake Charles felt the full force of Hurricane Laura and now residents who rode out the disaster are picking up the pieces\nClassie Ballou lives on the fifth floor of Chateau du Lac, an eight-story retirement home in the Louisiana city of Lake Charles. \u201cI made it through Rita,\u201d he said from a park bench in the rubble of downtown as he reflected on the fury of Hurricane Laura that had just roared through his home town. \u201cHonestly, I thought it wasn\u2019t going to be that bad.\u201d\nHe shook his head. \u201cIf I were doing it over, I would leave.\u201d\nAt 2am Thursday, he woke up to feel the building \u2013 which provides a home for disabled residents \u2013 swaying back and forth as the category 4 storm hit. His neighbors on the eighth floor felt the roof go at about the same time. Soon, his room was full of water from the rain running through the building.\nShalonda Brouchet, who also lives in the building, didn\u2019t trust her car to make it to Houston, so she spent the night as well. Windows began to blow out, and a set of dumpsters began to crash around in the parking lot. \u201cThe wind, it just kept coming.\u201d\nIn the morning, Ballou and Brouchet walked the streets of downtown to assess the damage, and then gathered in a covered area under the building with neighbors.\n\u201cThere\u2019s devastation everywhere,\u201d said Ballou, pointing towards the collapsed roof of a home-goods store across the street. \u201cThis is the worst I\u2019ve ever seen, and I came up remembering Audrey,\u201d a storm that killed 416 people in the same part of Louisiana in 1957.\nMatthew Dubone, another resident, said they didn\u2019t expect to hear from their property manager about the habitability of their apartments till Monday. \u201cThis building is out of commission,\u201d said Brouchet. There is no electricity and no water, although the rooms are soaked.\nNow, Dubone said, they survey the wreckage that was Lake Charles and wait for help to come.\nThe cars in the parking lot of their building are mostly ruined, smashed by pieces of the falling roof, and the Texas-bound interstate \u2013 where most residents say they would go - is blocked. They have piled frozen chicken thighs and pork chops on a picnic table, along with a bottle of lighter fluid and bag of charcoal briquettes, and are getting ready to cook the meat before it rots.\nBy Friday morning, the storm had moved on, unleashing heavy rain hundreds of miles inland from where the hurricane made landfall, and prompting tornado warnings from Alabama to Tennessee and heavy weather forecasts all the way up the eastern seaboard into Connecticut.\nBut as of early afternoon on Thursday, nobody had told them when or where aid workers might distribute food in the days ahead. On the street outside, a steady stream of trucks rolled by, which they said were focused on clearing downed trees.\n\u201cEveryone who lives here is disabled. A lot of them left or were evacuated and we was the ones who couldn\u2019t make it,\u201d said another resident, Kelvin Lamplin.\nLouisiana is still under restrictions designed to cope with the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 such as a mask mandate \u2013 but in Lake Charles masks were nowhere to be seen on residents, rescue workers and even the soldiers on the crowded national guard convoys rolling through town. Near the town a chlorine plant erupted with thick, billowing smoke after being damaged by the storm. Authorities ordered people around the plant to stay in their homes with windows and doors shut.\nLaura has headed north of the state as a tropical storm after hitting the Louisiana coast with blasts of wind up to 150mph strong. Officials warned of \u201ccatastrophic conditions\u201d and more than 600,000 people fled its path.\nBut not Chrystal and Ben Johnson. They rode out the storm with their family in the historic office building they own downtown. They live 30 miles north of Lake Charles in Ragley, Louisiana, but thought that the building was safer. \u201cThis place has 2ft-thick walls, and a pump in the basement,\u201d said Ben. \u201cHouses roar,\u201d said Chrystal, but this building, which was once a post office and court, stayed quiet.\nNow, anticipating weeks without power, they are planning to drive back north and gather their belongings, and then leave the state. The family is receiving a steady stream of updates about relief efforts nearby. Another family member, chiming in from behind them, said the national guard had begun guarding the local CVS store, and had heard that the Cajun Navy, famous for its civilian rescue effort during Katrina, was still looking for somewhere to set up a base.\nIn front of one of Lake Charles\u2019 few high-rise buildings downtown, a volunteer rescue worker who identified himself only as James described spending the night inside a jammed elevator. He said that he had been in at least 20 storms, and came to Lake Charles on Wednesday to prepare for the aftermath. A friend let him stay inside the tower, home to a Capitol One office, but in the middle of the night, he got antsy about the storm surge, and decided to take a service elevator to the 16th floor.\nHalfway up, he heard a voice through the speaker that said \u201cElevator out of service\u201d, and then he was stuck. He had brought meteorological equipment, and watched the pressure drop as the eye of the hurricane passed over. \u201cThe barometer dropped an inch. I\u2019ve been in a lot of storms, and I\u2019ve never seen that before.\u201d\nAs the eyewall whipped the city, \u201csomething gave, and the whole building shredded\u201d.\nJames was sure that the others who had taken cover inside the tower were gone. But in the morning, he pried open the door and then used a piece of metal to scratch his way through the sheetrock elevator shaft. From there, he had enough service to call for help, and rescue workers smashed the rest of the way through.\nA few blocks from downtown, 18-year-olds Draven Smith and Aidan Abshire wound through debris-covered streets in a rattling pickup, gathering fallen traffic signs.\nThe pair had waited out the storm in their house just outside Lake Charles after realizing that all the gas stations were closed, and they didn\u2019t have enough gas to evacuate. Like others, the wind, and the shaking, roaring, is what stuck with them. \u201cSurprisingly,\u201d said Abshire, \u201cours is the only house that\u2019s OK. Roofs are ripped off, fences are all down, windows broken.\u201d\nAs an army corps truck rolled by, they changed the conversation to the rumors of looting they had heard, although they hadn\u2019t seen any themselves.\n\u201cA hurricane, when it comes through, feels like a big warning, from God,\u201d says Abshire, \u201cA big push that things should change. The looting, the riots. The way people are treating our Earth.\u201d",

        "content": "After outrage at her death in Glasgow, people who knew her recall her vibrant spirit and devotion to her son\nMercy Baguma loved colourful lipsticks: red, blue, purple \u2013 the brighter the better. It was a reflection of her personality, says a close friend. \u201cMercy was a rainbow,\u201d she said. \u201cShe had such a vibrant spirit. As a friend, she would always put you first. She really was the best of the best.\u201d\nBaguma, 34, was found dead in a flat in Glasgow at the weekend next to her distressed one-year-old son, prompting outrage as reports circulated that she and the boy had been \u201cstarving\u201d, the latest victims of a brutal asylum system.\nBut as the week has progressed a more complex picture has emerged. Through speaking to close friends and associates, the Guardian has pieced together a fuller picture of Baguma as a mother, a friend and a daughter, whose father was a former Ugandan MP. Above all, a person, rather than a symbol of systemic failure.\nThe friend who described Baguma as a rainbow first met her in 2014 at the Calabash, an African restaurant in Glasgow city centre where Baguma was a popular member of staff until her immigration status changed and she was barred from working or claiming benefits.\n\u201cMercy was a hard worker and she paid every single tax. When she wasn\u2019t working she got support from family and friends. I just don\u2019t recognise these reports that she was alone and starving.\u201d\nShe recalled nights after work with Baguma when they would bring food home from the restaurant and watch a film together. \u201cWe were all about the African food,\u201d she said.\nAfter Baguma\u2019s son was born, everything changed. \u201cShe was devoted to him. He was so happy and healthy and she made sure he had everything he needed.\u201d\nBecky Duncan, a photographer, was asked by the Refugee Survival Trust in Glasgow to take portraits of Baguma and her baby in July 2019 after Baguma agreed to help with their campaign material. She also got to know Baguma at the Wee Welcome group run by the charity.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely group that\u2019s open to everyone. They sing some songs, the kids play with toys and the mums have a cup of tea and a natter. She went regularly and it was obvious that she was well liked, well supported, and giving support to other mums.\u201d\nShe was an easy subject to photograph, Duncan said. \u201cMercy was beautiful. Every time I saw her she looked impeccable and radiant. Mercy really appreciated and understood what the Refugee Survival Trust was doing, and helping them with their campaigning was her way to give back.\u201d\nOne photograph, taken on the airy top balcony of the Briggait, the city\u2019s fish market, shows Baguma holding her baby aloft, her long braids spilling down behind, as mother and son look rapt into each other\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cI was really awestruck by how great she was with her young baby,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cI\u2019ve got two young ones myself and I know how hard it can be. I remember meeting her once when she was on the way to visit friends for the weekend. Everything was so neat and perfectly packed. I was smiling at her thinking: wow, she\u2019s doing so well in spite of everything.\u201d\nAll of those who knew Baguma, even in passing, remark upon her warmth. Her friend Bridget, who set up an online fundraiser for her funeral expenses that has amassed more than \u00a345,000, said: \u201cHer smile made everyone so welcome and comfortable.\u201d\nBaguma is believed to have arrived in the UK as a student in the mid-noughties. The daughter of a well-established Ugandan family, she studied at a college in Paisley. Afterwards she went through immigration and asylum processes and, like many caught in the \u201chostile environment\u201d, it appears that at times she endured hardship despite being willing and able to support herself.\nDuring this hardship, Baguma was supported by family, friends and a number of charities, which all emphasise that it was a mutual process, with Baguma keen to give back to those who helped her. It is also clear from those who knew her that her child was much-loved and well provided for.\nNonetheless, there were inevitable strains and stresses, and the agencies helping her say it became clear this summer that she was struggling with the effects of hardship, and that owing to the Covid lockdown she had fewer places to get support.\nEve, an outreach worker with Glasgow\u2019s grassroots, migrant-led support group More, spoke to Baguma in late July. \u201cShe spoke about feeling overwhelmed but not isolated: she said that she had good friends and a support network. Her concern was for her baby\u2019s welfare, and about how powerless she felt because she wasn\u2019t able to work to support herself, and how lockdown was exacerbating that.\u201d\nBaguma\u2019s elder sister, a human rights lawyer living in Uganda, released a statement to the BBC in Kampala on Thursday in which she expressed concerns about the media reporting of her sister\u2019s death, in particular some suggestions that Mercy or her child had been starving. She cautioned against jumping to conclusions until the full facts had emerged.\nAnother friend said parcels of African food of the kind seen being delivered to Baguma during lockdown in a widely shared charity video were sent not only to people in extreme poverty but to many others struggling to source specific foodstuffs during the pandemic.\nPolice Scotland have said they are treating Baguma\u2019s death as \u201cunexplained but not suspicious\u201d. The Crown Office has received a report and the death is under investigation by the Scottish fatalities investigation unit. Bridget said that although her friend was known to have health problems, her death was sudden and unexpected.\nWhile the circumstances of Baguma\u2019s death, and her relationship with the asylum system, remain unclear, those close to her are anxious that she is presented as a person rather than a victim.\nHer family in Uganda hope to bring her home for burial, but face practical difficulties as the principal airport in Uganda remains closed because of the pandemic.\nMeanwhile, Mercy\u2019s son is said to be thriving. A friend of the family said he is learning to walk.\nBut he will be reaching out for other hands for balance.",
