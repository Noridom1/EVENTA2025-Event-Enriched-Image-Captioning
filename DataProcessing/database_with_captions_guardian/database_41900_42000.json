        "content": "The shale industry made the US a major producer once again. But Covid-19 looks likely to ruin many prospectors\nThe US shale industry was forecast to deliver record high oil production this year. Only a few months ago the Permian basin was expected to increase its oil output to a new high of 4.8 million barrels per day, on the way to spurring the entire US market to a record daily output rate of 9 million bpd in 2020.\nThe Permian, North America\u2019s largest shale basin, has been one of the biggest drivers of a shale oil boom that helped make the United States the biggest oil producer in the world, ahead of Saudi Arabia and Russia.\nInstead, the region \u2013 which stretches from western Texas to eastern New Mexico \u2013 has endured its biggest one-month production decline in history. Now observers expect to see a string of oil-well closures, rising debts and bankruptcies as the coronavirus pandemic slashes demand for crude and threatens to wipe out hundreds of startup frackers. Suddenly, reaching 9 million bpd has become highly unlikely.\nThe impact of the virus has slashed demand for oil across the globe, triggering a race to fill the world\u2019s remaining storage facilities with unwanted crude to avoid shutting down wells entirely In the US, this has forced producers to pay customers to take their barrels, and caused the worst price collapse in market history.\n\u201cThe current price environment is more or less a complete disaster for the majority of shale companies,\u201d says Artem Abramov, head of global shale research at the consultancy Rystad Energy. \u201cAt $30 a barrel, many companies would be able to adapt gradually. But at $20 a barrel, many players \u2013 especially those with poor balance sheets \u2013 will struggle financially.\u201d\nThe benchmark price of US crude, known as the West Texas Intermediate (WTI), crashed below zero for the first time last week for May deliveries, and the price for June dropped by a third to just over $15. The rest of the price curve for 2020 shows prices under $30 a barrel \u2013 well below the $55 that most US producers need to break even.\nThe US largest storage facility \u2013 at Cushing in Oklahoma \u2013 is already two-thirds full and the remaining capacity is understood to have been snapped up by oil traders and brokers. Meanwhile, off the US coast, supergiant oil tankers \u2013 each filled with around 2 million barrels of crude \u2013 have been paid to stand idle as makeshift storage. Oil producers without storage space have limited options: sell crude at a loss to those still willing to take it, or shut down oil wells and risk financial ruin.\n\u201cThere are no good answers for the industry in a $30-per-barrel environment,\u201d says Stephen Richardson, an analyst at Evercore ISI. \u201cLet\u2019s not fool ourselves: it\u2019s all uneconomic and likely to stay that way.\u201d\nAbramov says: \u201cMarket forces will ultimately regulate the industry in a very brutal manner, forcing massive \u2018shut-ins\u2019 [well closures] across the country before the market imbalance can improve.\u201d\nThe crash threatens to change the face of the industry, say experts. The number of fracking projects in America\u2019s shale heartlands has already fallen by two-thirds as oil producers struggle to find buyers for their crude, or space to store it.\nFracking, also known as hydraulic fracturing, involves pumping water, chemicals and sand underground at high pressure to fracture tightly packed shale rock and release trapped oil and gas. It is a controversial method, with environmental groups warning that it could pose a health hazard by poisoning water aquifers \u2013 on top of producing more carbon-intensive fossil fuels. But it has made the US a powerhouse in oil and gas production once more.\nContinental Resources, the largest oil producer in North Dakota, has reportedly stopped all drilling and shut in most of its wells in the state\u2019s Bakken shale field. The company, owned by billionaire Harold Hamm, is understood to have told customers it will not be supplying oil after the collapse in oil markets last week.\nThe US oil giants ExxonMobil and Chevron have also set out plans to rein in production and spending. Exxon will cut planned spending by 30% or $10bn (\u00a38.1bn) this year, while Chevron will cut spending by a fifth, or $4bn, compared with last year.\nThe downturn is likely to hit the thousands of small, sometimes family-owned, US fracking companies, which will be forced into administration or into mergers with more financially resilient rivals.\n\u201cThis will be oil\u2019s last dance for many US producers, as the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to save the shale industry will fall short,\u201d says Konstantinos Venetis, a senior economist at research firm TS Lombard. \u201cNorth American shale oil producers will be forced to shut in very soon and most of the smaller players will not be able to survive this low-price and dismal-demand environment.\u201d\nPresident Trump is preparing to use treasury funds to buy US oil to store in the government\u2019s strategic reserves, and is understood to be considering blocks on all imports of crude from Saudi Arabia which are already en route. The measures may offer respite to a few producers but are too little too late, analysts say.\nThe industry cannot expect the same help from investors that was offered following the 2015 oil market crash either. Investors ploughed about $50bn into the industry in 2016, but rising debt and low returns have now sharpened investor expectations and eroded their appetite for risk. In February Moody\u2019s, the credit rating agency, warned that a \u201cstaggering\u201d $86bn worth of shale-industry debt was due to be repaid by 2024.\n\u201cEven before the oil price crash, the business models began to change. Investors historically provided a lot of capital to the industry to finance the capital growth. Last year, they began asking these companies to come up with more disciplined and balanced capital programmes and focus more on profitability,\u201d Abramov says.\nThe companies that survive will be the leanest left standing, he adds. \u201cIt won\u2019t be the same industry once prices recover.\u201d\n This article was amended on 29 April 2020 to correct the heading above the oil well graphic. It originally said that fracking had fallen by \u201cmore than a third\u201d, when that should have been two thirds.",

We\u2019re seeing the dissemination of material claiming that immigrants spread coronavirus, and that authoritarian regimes outperform western liberal democracies in tackling the health crisis.\u201d\nZinc Network said British far-right groups such as Britain First and the Knights Templar International, as well as the BNP\u2019s former leader, Nick Griffin, have used the crisis to promote themselves as supporters of the community during the lockdown. Griffin has posted images of himself on social media distributing food parcels.\nZinc Network, which in the past has attracted scrutiny for its work promoting the Home Office\u2019s anti-radicalisation strategy, Prevent, studied social media posts, photos, videos, journals, official records and media reports to produce the analysis.\nIt said one key narrative being pushed by the far right is that the spread of coronavirus is the consequence of illegal immigration. Allied to this is the claim that nations with tightly-controlled borders are better prepared to deal with the pandemic. Another is the premise that modern liberal states are on the verge of collapse, and that their fall can be accelerated through armed action or by a major crisis.\nThe promotion of survivalist material by far-right groups is also becoming a trend. Zinc says neo-Nazi publisher Arktos has been publishing updated and expanded editions of far-right survivalist texts.\nA favoured tactic among far-right groups is to put fake documents into circulation, designed to look like real medical or government communications. According to Zinc\u2019s monitoring, far-right Telegram channels have been instrumental in circulating a fake scan of a positive Covid-19 test for the former vice-president and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.\nThe same channels have also been distributing government pandemic response documents with a view to helping would-be attackers plan their actions.\nSome far-right organisations are using the crisis to impersonate other groups, Zinc claims. Fake Extinction Rebellion flyers have been found in several cities in the UK proclaiming \u201cCorona is the cure \u2013 humans are the disease\u201d.\nMost of the leaflets condemn immigration, with some calling for the public to \u201clearn about the JQ\u201d \u2013 the \u201cJewish question\u201d. Others promote conspiracy theories or deny the Russian novichok attack in Salisbury.\nBrooke said: \u201cThese extremist groups are using the coronavirus as an opportunity to further their ideological objectives by spreading fear and division and exacerbating social tensions.\u201d",

        "content": "There are reasons for optimism as the UK economy and much of the rest of the world plunges into recession. That might seem like a bizarre statement when the recession is forecast to be the deepest in several centuries.\nYet there are several arguments for remaining hopeful. Looking back, it is clear that previous pandemics have reduced inequality. And this one could, at least in the short term, be no exception. As the Nobel prize-winning economist Sir Angus Deaton has written: \u201cIt is an equal opportunity infection that does not pass over world leaders, senior politicians and celebrities.\u201d\nWriting in the Financial Times, the Harvard economist Amartya Sen, another Nobel prize winner, says there is room for optimism as collective action is appreciated (rather than being denigrated as the first steps towards communism). \u201cThe need to act together can certainly generate an appreciation of the constructive role of public action.\u201d\nThe Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, is another who is hopeful that collective action will be appreciated long after a vaccine is found for Covid-19. His emphasis is on voluntary groups and the spontaneous urge of the community-minded to come together, appreciating the need to take on issues such as climate change, or to care for those less well equipped to deal with modern life.\nOf course, any action to improve living standards and general wellbeing once the lockdown is lifted will need money, and the potential for governments to access plentiful funds is another reason for optimism. After the 2008 financial crash, the largely conservative governments that ran the developed world were emotionally averse to persistently high levels of debt, even when their purpose was to spur a recovery and ultimately reduce the debt as a proportion of national income (GDP).\nThe intellectual veneer put on this was an argument about debt markets and interest rates. The central thesis was that a debt-to-GDP ratio above 80-90% ran the risk of triggering a panic sale of government bonds. The result would be rocketing interest rates and a return to deep recession. As chancellor, George Osborne addressed the bond markets as if he were a modern-day Uriah Heep, \u2019umbly begging their pardon while he dutifully visited a long-lasting and painful austerity upon the poorest sections of society.\nA pandemic means all countries must raise funds on the debt markets to bail out vital industries and prevent mass unemployment. The bond investor has nowhere to go other than to lend to highly indebted governments. Another factor determining the impotence of these investors is the crazy risk of switching their funds into equities when so little is known about which companies will survive and prosper in the post-pandemic age, Amazon notwithstanding.\nThe UK may enter 2021 with a debt-to-GDP level above 100% and few will think it a cause for concern. The sheer volume of funds in the bond markets looking for investment opportunities will mean interest rates stay low, allowing nations to pay their interest bill with room to spare. The UK will have the scope to support campaigns to write off developing-world debt while also repairing the country\u2019s tattered social fabric and investing in new infrastructure, healthcare provision and educational facilities.\nThere is a cost to this, which is the investment returns usually enjoyed by pension funds in the developed world, including those in the UK. They are the major bond investors, along with Middle East sovereign wealth funds, that must accept lower returns for lending governments their savings.\nFor a long time now, pension funds have wrestled with how to match steadily declining returns with unreasonable demands from savers for sky-high retirement incomes. The post-pandemic world is going to make that circle even harder to square.\nAnd this problem is not a side issue. Unless governments can work out a way to persuade older voters that their best interests lie, not in protecting their house prices and pension entitlements, but in rejecting austerity to favour a world where their savings are put to use \u2013 in part, to enhance health and social care \u2013 for them and their families, spending cuts and higher taxes will be the result.\nDeaton and Sen are ultimately gloomy about overcoming the long-term drift to inequality. For the British, who must soldier on with Boris Johnson as prime minister, that concern must be writ large.\nLet\u2019s hope the old, who traditionally vote Conservative in droves, see that the collective response to the pandemic should be maintained, not least for their own good.",

Arsenal decided to act after a week in which Granit Xhaka, David Luiz, Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 and Alexandre Lacazette were all reminded of their social distancing responsibilities, with all bar the latter being photographed training or playing in north London parks. The squad will now be able to operate, albeit to strict guidelines, in their usual workplace with a sharply decreased risk of flouting government regulations.\nA club spokesperson confirmed: \u201cPlayers will be permitted access to our London Colney training grounds next week. Access will be limited, carefully managed and social distancing will be maintained at all times. All Colney buildings remain closed. Players will travel alone, do their individual workout and return home.\u201d\nIt is understood that the players will be operating on a strict rota basis, with small groups on site at any one time. The training ground\u2019s 10 pitches, which have been maintained by a skeleton staff over the past six weeks while the complex was officially closed, will be put to full use in order to ensure there is no overcrowding while members of the team work alone. Drills overseen by coaching staff are not yet in Arsenal\u2019s thinking.\nWhile the training ground\u2019s availability to the squad \u2013 44 days after it was shut upon news of Mikel Arteta\u2019s Covid-19 diagnosis \u2013 is a positive development it seems borne more of a desire to ensure professional behaviour from players than an indication that football\u2019s return has taken a significant leap forward. But other clubs may take note, with Tottenham landing themselves in hot water twice recently over workouts held in public spaces.

Death toll figures are also controversial, with some countries reporting deaths as confirmed Covid-19 cases on the basis of symptoms and in the absence of a positive test, while others are not including them.\nBritain has become the fifth country in the world to reach the grim milestone of exceeding 20,000 coronavirus-related deaths.\nGovernment figures released on Saturday showed that a further 813 people died in hospital after testing positive for Covid-19, taking the country\u2019s total to 20,319. These figures do not include the thousands of more deaths known to have taken place in care homes.\nIt comes almost six weeks after the UK government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, said that keeping the toll under 20,000 would be \u201ca good outcome in terms of where we would hope to get\u201d.\nThe South African government has ordered citizens to wear face masks from 1 May when coronavirus lockdown restrictions will begin to be eased.\n\u201cIt is going to be mandatory to use a cloth mask as you step out of your home,\u201d the traditional affairs minister, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, told a press conference in Pretoria. She added that people could use a scarf or T-shirt if they do not have a mask. South Africa has been on lockdown since 27 March.\nFar-right groups in the UK, US and EU are exploiting the coronavirus crisis to push their anti-minority agendas and win new support, Jamie Doward reports. A report by the Zinc Network, a communications agency that tracks disinformation and propaganda, suggests there has been a clear pivot among far-right movements to \u201cutilise the pandemic to bring new relevancy, attention and support for their key grievances\u201d.\nDozens of doctors and nurses in Pakistan have launched a hunger strike over a lack of protective masks and other equipment for treating patients with Covid-19. More than 150 doctors in Pakistan have tested positive for coronavirus and several have died, according to the Young Doctors Association in Punjab, the country\u2019s worst-hit province.\nSalman Haseeb, head of the Punjab\u2019s Grand Health Alliance, said about 30 doctors and nurses in Punjab were on hunger strike. \u201cWe do not intend on stopping until the government listens to our demands. They have been consistently refusing to adhere to our demands,\u201d Haseeb told AFP.\nThe World Health Organization has warned that deaths from malaria could double this year as a result of the disruption caused by Covid-19. The UN\u2019s global health agency said that if countries failed to maintain delivery of insecticide-treated nets and access to antimalarial medicines, up to 769,000 people could die of malaria this year.

Of all the solutions being suggested over the past few weeks this is the obvious one and the easiest to put into practice.\nYes, something will have to be done about the loose ends, some formula found to come up with an order of \u201csporting merit\u201d, but this should not be beyond the wit of a worldwide game with profits measured in the billions.\nEveryone knows the real desire to see leagues completed and matches played behind closed doors comes from the money men anyway. There certainly seems to be little enthusiasm for such plans from players and coaches and for that reason alone justifications of sporting integrity ought to be treated with suspicion.\nThe Premier League season is hopelessly compromised. Playing out every single fixture at some point in mid-summer might seem the fairest option, yet the artificiality of the exercise would quickly become apparent once games got under way. Liverpool were on course for a record-breaking season before the shutdown, probably about to overtake the 100-points total Manchester City reached two years ago.\nDoes anyone imagine that trajectory will be maintained if fixtures are completed behind close doors? Liverpool\u2019s desire to claim the title by playing rather than points-per-game ratios is understandable, though given that a win or two is all they now need would their enthusiasm to reach new heights last until their final fixture, whenever that might be?\nIn the event of the league being completed in empty stadiums, it is highly unlikely all 20 teams would be equally motivated. There would be a huge difference between playing a side pre-lockdown and a post-lockdown version anxious to get the formalities out of the way and begin looking forward to next season, so obtaining a final league table might still turn out to be something of a lottery. Traditionally, teams with nothing much to play for near the end of a season still pride themselves in putting on a performance, but whether that logic would apply in stadiums devoid of fans is anyone\u2019s guess.\nThe point is, really, that playing out the season just for the sake of it would be utterly pointless and quite possibly dangerous. The determination of Premier League clubs to find a way to do it is based only on a desire to avoid paying back large amounts of broadcast revenue. Yet if we are all supposed to be in this crisis together then surely BT and Sky, who disclosed profits of \u00a32bn and \u00a31.2bn on the back of football in their most recent results, should not now be holding the game to ransom.\nFootball has been living in the bubble of silly money for too long if it cannot see that these are extraordinary circumstances. No one wants a truncated season, but no one asked for self-isolation and physical distancing either.\nEveryone is making sacrifices and, with the government constantly warning the situation will go on for weeks if not months, it would be folly to place relegation and promotion issues above health concerns when a little adaptability is all that is required.\nAs has already been suggested, no one need be relegated this season, just for once. If a mechanism can be agreed upon to determine which teams deserve promotion, each division could be allowed to bulge a bit until the danger is over.\nWhat happens to the Champions League is a thornier problem and one Uefa is unlikely to relax its stance of wishing to see it played out, though even if it ends up impinging on next season it involves relatively few teams and matches, as does the Europa League.\nGermany is ahead of most in terms of testing, tracking and containing the coronavirus, yet taking advantage of that to reintroduce a football programme is still likely to prove hugely controversial. Though large public gatherings are banned until October, the earliest possible date at which football with spectators could resume, Bundesliga players are back in training and clubs have asked government permission to commence games behind closed doors next month.\nNot everyone is impressed. Though anything half-decent to watch on television would be welcome in most households at the moment, Germany is not yet out of lockdown and the question of propriety has been raised. One fans\u2019 organisation said restarting the football season in the middle of a pandemic would be \u201csheer mockery for the rest of society\u201d. Hard to argue. Just how important does football think it is?",

The fees were introduced in 2015.\nThe move was described as a perverse deterrent to workers the government needed to attract, and there have been reports of nurses facing fees of thousands of pounds a year in both visa charges and the surcharge so they and their families can access the health service and remain in the UK.\nAsked if this was the right time to abolish it for NHS workers, Patel said: \u201cYou\u2019ll be aware of many changes we have already made around the immigration status, the visa status for NHS workers, extending their visas already if they were coming up for expiry.\n\u201cWe have a range of measures that are, like most things in government, under review, and we are looking at everything including visas, surcharge \u2026 We are looking at everything we can do to continue to support everyone on the frontline in the NHS.\u201d\nAt the end of March, the Home Office said that NHS workers \u2013 and their family members \u2013 would automatically have their visas extended free of charge for one year.\nSpeaking at the daily briefing for the first time, Lynne Owens, the director general of the National Crime Agency (NCA), also warned that \u201camoral, corrupt and exploitative\u201d criminals were seeking to take advantage of the crisis.\nMore than 2,000 online scams relating to coronavirus have been taken down including fake shops selling bogus testing kits and PPE, she said.\nPatel sought to warn criminals seeking to exploit the current situation that they would be pursued. She said the NCA had flagged up 1,300 possible child sexual offences to police.\nIn her closing remarks, the home secretary said: \u201cAny criminal seeking to exploit this virus for their own gain, our outstanding police and law enforcement agencies are absolutely on to you.\u201d\nThe press conference came amid apparent concern in government about waning respect for physical distancing measures.\nNHS England\u2019s medical director, Stephen Powis, exhibited a slide showing a slight increase in the number of journeys taken and warned people to avoid travel and to physically distance \u2013 with the measures now in place until at least 7 May \u2013 during the UK\u2019s fifth weekend under lockdown.\nThe Home Office said: \u201cWe are immensely grateful for the work NHS doctors, nurses and paramedics are doing to tackle coronavirus, and this is why we applied a one-year visa extension to all those whose visas are due to expire before 1 October 2020 \u2013 this is completely free of charge and includes an exemption from the immigration health surcharge.\n\u201cWe will continue to look at whether we can provide further assistance during the fight against this virus.\u201d\n This article was amended on 29 April 2020. An earlier version said the UK had become the fifth country to pass 20,000 deaths in hospital from coronavirus. This should have referred to all deaths, not just those in hospital.

        "content": "Dozens of health workers were infected and thousands quarantined, stretching medical resources. But how did it spread so quickly?\nMore than 1,000 Tasmanian health workers in mandatory quarantine following a Covid-19 outbreak in two hospitals are preparing to return to work \u2013 but they are no closer to understanding how the virus spread so rapidly.\nThe secretary of the health and community services union, Tim Jacobson, said the morale of the workers had plummeted since the quarantine began on Easter Sunday, when staff from the North West Private and North West Regional hospitals and their families were ordered to stay home for 14 days following a cluster of more than 110 cases. The lockdown represented almost 5% of the region\u2019s population and removed a significant proportion of its workforce, leaving GP clinics to fill the gap.\nWhile a passenger from the Ruby Princess cruise shop is thought to be the origin of the north-west outbreak, it does not explain how the infection then spread so rapidly and widely throughout the hospitals between staff, patients and wards, Jacobson said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been difficult for us to determine when it was known there was a virus outbreak at the hospital and to find out which work areas people contracted it in,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has been a significant level of secrecy around this from the department and the government.\n\u201cAs we move closer to reopening the hospitals people are confused about the circumstances about getting back to work, even simple things like rostering and the provision of personal protective equipment haven\u2019t been communicated, or the cleaning that\u2019s to be undertaken in their work areas.\n\u201cIt\u2019s shameful and disgraceful that the department hasn\u2019t put the systems in place to ensure those workers sent home receive information, or even a courtesy call from managers to ask how they are and if they need anything.\u201d\nGuardian Australia contacted the state\u2019s health minister, Sarah Courtney, for comment but did not receive a response. On Thursday the premier, Peter Gutwein, said four more cases connected to the north-west outbreak had been identified overnight. More than 200 cases have been confirmed across the state since the pandemic began. Tighter restrictions in the north-west as a result of the cluster, that were due to be lifted on Sunday, were likely to remain in place for an extra week, Gutwein said. Schools are unlikely to reopen as planned. The testing threshold is also lower in the region.\nThe state\u2019s public health unit told Guardian Australia an interim epidemiological report of the outbreak was almost complete.\n\u201cEpidemiological and microbiological analyses are expected to provide further understanding of the sources and patterns of transmission of coronavirus in this outbreak,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cThis is a complex process and does take time to deliver accurate findings.\u201d\nThe emergency department of the public hospital reopened on 17 April, but is not admitting patients. The maternity ward will be reopened next, with a date not yet confirmed. Patients in the two hospitals were transferred to the Mersey Community hospital. Most new patients requiring admission are in the meantime being sent to Launceston hospital or, if they need high-level care, Hobart. But it takes more than 1.5 hours to drive from Burnie, where the north-west hospitals are located, to Launceston, and almost four hours to drive to Hobart.\n\u201cMassive distances are now being covered by ambulance,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cThere is also a major problem with ambulance resourcing. There was a rescue package allocated to the ambulance service but we don\u2019t have the bodies on the ground to pick up all those extra shifts to cover the workload in north-west. Paramedics from the south and north are working overtime where they can to meet the north-west paramedics along the route and take over. Fatigue is an issue.\u201d\nSenator for Tasmania Jacqui Lambie says it is likely several factors will be found to have led to the devastating cluster.\n\u201cHow did it get out of control in the first place and what procedures should have been in place that weren\u2019t? What happened between the Ruby Princess passenger becoming sick and being in hospital?\u201d Lambie said people in the region of Burnie were particularly vulnerable to the virus, with a large elderly population and people in poor health.\n\u201cWe have a fairly high unemployment rate, we have fourth-generation welfare recipients, and we know people on welfare often don\u2019t have the best health outcomes,\u201d Lambie said. \u201cWe are among the oldest, poorest and sickest in the country.\u201d\nInfection control procedures will be examined as part of the public health investigation into how the virus took hold. Golden staph infections acquired in hospitals are one of the indicators health departments use to examine how strong a hospital\u2019s infection control procedures are. While private hospitals are not required to report this data, Australian Institute of Health and Welfare data for 2018 show Tasmanian public hospital infection rates were well below the national benchmark of two cases per 10,000 patient days. The North-West Regional hospital has the lowest rate in the state.\nHowever, there have been serious concerns raised about how some hospitals have handled aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic. In late March, a unit manager from Launceston general hospital told staff in an email to \u201ccollect all used, undamaged and unsoiled P2 masks\u201d so the masks could be investigated for reuse. But P2 masks are recommended for single use only.\nIt wasn\u2019t until Sunday, almost three weeks later, that the Tasmanian health service issued a notice to all staff clarifying the masks were being collected as part of a trial to see if they could be successfully decontaminated, but were not to be reused, and that there was sufficient mask stock.\nAustralian Nursing and Midwifery Federation Tasmanian branch secretary, Emily Shepherd, said \u201cit does appear there was a miscommunication in terms of the rationale for collecting the masks\u201d.\n\u201cThat\u2019s now been very firmly clarified,\u201d she said.\nBut Jacobson, from the health services union, is sceptical. \u201cWe raised the issue weeks ago and it\u2019s only after media attention the email went out clarifying what the masks were to be collected for, so that makes me suspicious and cynical,\u201d he said. \u201cAgain, there has been a lack of clarity.\u201d\nShepherd and Jacobson both say doctors, nurses, paramedics and other health staff have been through a traumatic time. Blame incorrectly assigned to the health workers by the prime minister added to this distress. Away from their workplaces and left to manage their entire household in isolation, health workers are still unclear on what the return to work will look like or how the hospitals will be progressively reopened.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if we will ever be clear about how this outbreak started,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cLessons need to be learned and processes put in place to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again. The government needs to come clean and say \u2018here\u2019s what we uncovered, here\u2019s what went wrong, this is why we had this outbreak\u2019. Simply cleaning the hospitals and putting in place new standards and procedures when staff return doesn\u2019t tell the story.\u201d",

One species, monga waratah, had 50% of its range burned.\n\u201cSome species were considered threatened before the fires, and the fires have now likely increased their risk of extinction,\u201d the department\u2019s summary said.\nThe plant analysis, led by Dr Rachael Gallagher from Macquarie University, said some species such as the forrester\u2019s bottlebrush, betka bottlebrush and grey deua pomaderris are at imminent risk of extinction because all their known or modelled range has been burned, and they are exposed to significant other stresses such as pre-fire drought conditions, high fire frequency or severity, or diseases.\nIt said the Wollemi pines were a priority for immediate action to mitigate post-fire impacts, along with several species of ground orchid.\nThe Greens environment spokeswoman, Sarah Hanson-Young, said she was concerned that EPBC review would not account for \u201cthe full impact\u201d of the bushfires because much of the assessment work was still to be done.\n\u201cHow could you have a comprehensive and extensive review without factoring in that information, given the baseline has now changed?\u201d she said.\nThe government has committed to $50m in funding for wildlife recovery after the bushfires. As part of that, it has set aside $12m for grants for recovery work for plants and invertebrates.",

It was quite horrific \u2013 the hospitality sector was reduced by a quarter, and overall there were 6% fewer Australian with a job in the first week of April compared to a month earlier.\nEven if we assume that is the full impact this month (which is optimistic), such a fall is utterly unprecedented.\nIt is roughly equivalent to the amount of jobs lost during the 1990s recession. But whereas that occurred over 30 months, this took just one.\nThe problem of course is that as a rule it takes longer to recover the jobs than it does to lose them. And so we see the government, economists and (to paraphrase Paul Keating) every pet-shop galah talking about what is needed to get the economy moving again.\nThe obvious point is that until the health situation returns to some level of normalcy, all talk of snapping back is just pabulum.\nBut that aside, what is clear is that any thought that we\u2019re about to see a kumbaya moment of coming together of opposing views on the economy is completely gone.\nThe coronavirus may have seen the government engage in the largest economic spending in history but do not expect it to remain of the view that a large government is needed.\nThis week the head of the RBA, Philip Lowe, gave a speech which was variously reported and commented on by the prime minister and treasurer as being a sort of a game changer.\nScott Morrison suggested the speech showed \u201cit\u2019s not business as usual\u201d.\nYet governor Lowe\u2019s speech was hardly revelatory \u2013 the things he was calling for are things he has long been calling for. The Reserve Bank has also spent the better part of three years calling for more fiscal stimulus from the government, which was studiously ignored, and yet now apparently the RBA needs to be listened to with intent.\nAnd when we look at the things Morrisons listed as being needed, we see he is actually talking about business as usual: \u201cIt\u2019s about the federal government and the state governments working together in a whole field of areas from tax to industrial relations to infrastructure to skills and, of course, to cutting red tape and deregulation\u201d.\nMorrison and Frydenberg both spoke of productivity and referenced the Productivity Commission\u2019s \u201cShifting the Dial\u201d report issued in 2017 as needing to be revisited.\nBut it\u2019s business as usual when it comes to the government dismissing policy ideas it disagrees with, such as putting a price on carbon, and promoting things it does agree with, such as cutting red tape, as necessary \u201creform\u201d.\nIndeed we\u2019ve already seen this week the government looking to reduce environmental regulations.\nIt is worth nothing that economists do not agree on what will improve productivity and when politicians say \u201creform\u201d they mostly mean \u201cpolicy I am in favour of\u201d.\nStephen Kirchner, for example, says we need to encourage foreign investment flows and migration as well as a reduction of regulations, while John Quiggin argues that the impact of \u201cmicroeconomic reform\u201d such as industrial relations \u201chas been, and is likely to remain, marginal\u201d. He argues instead we need technology growth and a better skilled workforce.\nWe should also note that the Productivity Commission itself, when looking at industrial relations in 2015, noted that \u201cthere is little robust evidence that the different variants of [workplace relations] systems over the last 20 years have had detectable effects on measured economy-wide productivity\u201d.\nThe job losses are going to be dire, but don\u2019t let the crisis blind you to thinking any \u201creform\u201d is needed. While the government hopes to keep its stimulus spending (including the doubling of dole payments) to the short term, any changes to industrial relations and taxation \u2013 for good or ill \u2013 will be here for the long-term.\n Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

        "content": "There is a perception stillbirth \u2018just happens\u2019 but experts say 20% of the 2,170 babies born still a year could be saved\nAnne-Marie Imrie\u2019s first pregnancy was cruising along well. She\u2019d fallen pregnant quickly and she was healthy. As the months progressed, she started preparing \u2013 bought a pram and other baby items. And then, six and a half months in, baby Xavier\u2019s movements started to change. She didn\u2019t want to be a burden, so she didn\u2019t call her doctor when she became worried in the night. When she did see her GP, she was sent to hospital, and they did a scan. That\u2019s when she discovered Xavier had died.\n\u201cI was expecting \u2026 well, not that,\u201d she says.\nShe booked in to return the next day to be induced. On 31 January 2015, Xavier was born \u2013 one of six babies a day in Australia who are born still.\nFor nearly two decades, Australia\u2019s stillbirth rate has remained effectively unchanged. In 2016, it was assessed to be more than a third worse than the best-performing countries. Some 2,170 babies are stillborn each year. But that intransigence may be in the process of being disrupted as a new national program aims to slash the rate of stillbirth in late pregnancy by up to 20% by closing the gap between research and clinical practice across the country. And it aims to do so within just three years.\nThe national Safer Baby Bundle, launched in Canberra in October, intends to drive down Australia\u2019s stillbirth rate with a suite of eLearning modules, workshops and a campaign for pregnant women targeting five key areas.\nThe program, inspired by similar initiatives in Europe and the UK, builds on established research into stillbirth causes and prevention and emphasises support for women to cease smoking, encouraging pregnant women to sleep on their side and increasing expectant mothers\u2019 awareness of decreased foetal movements. For clinicians, the program aims to improve the way irregular foetal growth is monitored and managed, and how decisions are made regarding the timing of birth for higher-risk pregnancies.\nImrie, who is an ambassador for the Stillbirth Foundation, says that a program like this validates the trauma of experiences like hers, and treats it as a problem which needs addressing. It shines a light on those experiences, and on the children, like Xavier, who were lost.\n\u201cMany stillbirths are preventable,\u201d says Prof Vicki Flenady of the Stillbirth Centre for Research Excellence, which is leading the rollout of the Safer Baby Bundle nationally. \u201cWe can prevent this dreadful tragedy.\u201d The centre expects the program will be able to prevent up to 200 stillbirths after 28 weeks gestation each year.\nThe lack of movement on Australia\u2019s stillbirth rate despite the available research and devastation it wrecks on those impacted has caused consternation and despair among researchers, advocates and families.\n\u201cA lack of understanding and a lot of misperception about stillbirth are really at the core of the problem,\u201d says Flenady. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a reduction in newborn deaths and a lot of other adverse outcomes for mothers and newborn babies. But we haven\u2019t seen the reduction in stillbirth.\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s really the result of a reluctance to confront this tragedy. Pregnancy is supposed to be this wonderful happy time and everyone comes home with a baby, but all of a sudden it turns to tragedy, so it\u2019s not spoken about.\u201d\nLabor senator Kristina Keneally, who led a Senate select committee into stillbirths which preceded the development of the Safer Baby Bundle, says a sense of fatalism and stigma has pervaded the treatment of infant loss as a medical issue.\n\u201cWe have viewed stillbirth as a private tragedy, not a public health problem,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have had the view that there is nothing we can do to prevent stillbirth. It just happens.\u201d\nThe new program, she says, is a \u201cgiant step forward for Australian healthcare\u201d in equipping clinicians with the information, and vocabulary, for talking to expectant families about stillbirth prevention.\nImrie says removing the fatalism and taboo around stillbirth is important both for pregnant women, and for families who have suffered loss.\n\u201cI just want the subject of stillbirth to be more mainstream. It has been so hidden, so taboo, that when it does happen to people, they\u2019re extremely shocked. The perception of stillbirth is that it was something that happened historically, and it doesn\u2019t happen these days,\u201d she says.\n\u201cI think women are capable of handling this information in pregnancy, so they can be educated about prevention measures.\u201d\nThe Safer Baby Bundle is currently in its first stage of implementation. Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland have developed their own versions. Other states will come online in stage two, later this year, which will build in possible changes on the basis of findings from the initial rollout.\nSo far, about 3,700 clinicians have signed up to do the courses. Flenady says that it is too early for any results but early signs are encouraging.\nProf Michael Nicholl is leading the rollout of the program in NSW and says it has been embraced by midwives. He is working to bring more senior medical professionals and GPs on board. The program in NSW is initially being implemented in four local health districts which have a larger proportion of high-risk pregnancies, enabling the districts to tailor the messages for their own communities.\n\u201cWhat we have lacked in this space for a long time is a coordinated approach to the problem, and one of the things I hope we can embed in this work is a much more coordinated, and locally targeted, approach.\u201d\nNicholl says that the goal of preventing one in five late stillbirths is achievable.\nStill, there are yet more changes which could make a significant impact not only on stillbirth rates but to the families who have suffered a stillborn baby.\n\u201cI can\u2019t emphasise enough how significant the Safer Baby Bundle is for Australia,\u201d says Keneally. \u201cHowever, the Safer Baby Bundle alone will not be enough. Where countries have made massive reductions in stillbirth it is as a result of investigating every stillbirth and feeding the learnings from that back into the health system.\u201d\nFlenady says continuity of care \u2013 that is, a pregnant woman seeing the same midwife, GP or obstetrician throughout the course of her pregnancy \u2013 is key to improving outcomes, \u201cbut these things take a little more time\u201d.\nCritical, say Flenady and Nicholl, is ensuring all stillbirths are investigated and the data about the causes of these deaths is standardised. At present, the rate of stillbirth autopsy is lower than recommended and a significant proportion of stillbirth deaths are recorded as \u201ccauses unknown\u201d.\n\u201cWe have a national guideline on care after stillbirth and neonatal deaths,\u201d Flenady says. \u201cWe have had that for many years, and it says that all services should conduct an audit and look at the contributing factors, but the reality is that it has been a bit haphazard.\n\u201cWe need to improve that. And we need a consistent approach so we can compare apples with apples across the country and combine our data to determine where we really need to focus our attention.\u201d\nKeneally says that determining the cause of a stillbirth is not just important for the purpose of public health interventions but for individual families who hope to one day fall pregnant again. She says that stillbirths are often the last priority for autopsies, but that in her own experience of having a stillborn daughter, \u201cit was absolutely crucial in a subsequent pregnancy to know how to minimise risk\u201d.\nA draft national stillbirth action and implementation plan released in February identifies both developing a nationally consistent stillbirth auditing system, and supporting continuity of care, as goals that will have a substantial impact on further driving down Australia\u2019s stillbirth rates.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite remarkable,\u201d says Flenady, that a series of relatively small interventions could make such a significant difference in terms of the loss of life. \u201cBut we\u2019re here now, and I think it\u2019s going to make a big difference.\u201d\nImrie had a second son after Xavier, and is pregnant now with her third. She elected not to have a full autopsy of Xavier, and so his cause of death was determined as \u201cinconclusive\u201d. She sometimes wonders, had the Safer Baby Bundle been around when she was pregnant with Xavier, whether things may have turned out differently for her. \u201cBut, you know, that can\u2019t be changed. At least I can be a part of it and be a voice for my son and other families.\u201d",

        "content": "The wage subsidy was designed to support businesses and workers through the coronavirus crisis, but some simply can\u2019t afford it\nWhen the Australian government announced a $130bn wage subsidy employers, unions cheered.\nHere was the solution to growing queues for unemployment benefits, and a neat way to support workers\u2019 livelihoods without sending businesses broke, keeping them in jobs until coronavirus restrictions were lifted.\nBut while both still support the jobkeeper program, some of the shine has come off as employers and workers are bogged down in eligibility questions and fights for their share of the $1,500 fortnightly payment.\nThe subsidy was the first of its kind in Australia, requiring changes to industrial laws so employers could order employees to work at their usual rate of pay for as many hours as matched the payment.\nBut those powers \u2013 and employees insisting they want to stay home during the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 are now the source of class conflict, with payment or exclusion from jobkeeper the ultimate carrot and stick.\nThe first controversies about jobkeeper centred on eligibility. While Labor and unions welcomed the scheme, they criticised the exclusion of 1 million shorter-term casuals and 1.1 million temporary visa holders.\nNot every business can meet the 30% revenue downturn threshold to participate. Many industries are excluded explicitly, such as the public sector, including all local government employees, or in practice \u2013 such as those with high rates of contract work or short-term engagements including education, construction and the arts. Partnerships can only claim jobkeeper for one partner and employees.\nEmployment barrister Ian Neil says many employers are not applying for the scheme because they are concerned about uncertainty if they make a claim but then fall short of the 30% revenue reduction to be eligible.\nNeil says the Australian Tax Office has issued guidance that it will \u201csubstantially accept their self-assessment\u201d, provided the employer has an objective basis for predicting the revenue downturn and the assessment was reasonable. But most employers are unaware of this flexibility.\nThe biggest hurdle is the month-long gap in payments that must be bridged. Although jobkeeper is backdated to 30 March, employers must stump up the $1,500 payment all through April until reimbursement in the first week of May in order to be eligible.\nThe one-in all-in rule, that every eligible employee who nominates must be given a payment if the employer chooses to participate, prevents employers playing favourites and requires every worker to be paid.\nAnd because workers are entitled to $1,500 even if their regular pay packet is less, in many cases businesses will have a larger wage bill than usual, while suffering from the downturn.\nFor Blossom McKenzie-King\u2019s employer, that month of above-average wage bills was the difference between dropping out and participating in the scheme.\nMcKenzie-King, who worked for four years in a retail store in Melbourne\u2019s CBD, tells Guardian Australia she and her co-workers \u201cgot all our hopes up\u201d when jobkeeper was announced. \u201cWe thought \u2018we\u2019ll be fine, and this is really good news for the employer too\u2019.\u201d\nBut the business, which had already suffered poor sales as bushfire smoke blanketed Melbourne over summer, did not have enough cash to pay McKenzie-King and others until jobkeeper was reimbursed.\n\u201cSpeaking for my employer \u2013 they\u2019ve said they might not be able to reopen the store \u2026 and if another opportunity comes up I should take it.\n\u201cThey want to keep me employed, but it\u2019s hard to make promises when you can\u2019t be 100% sure you can keep them, when everything is so uncertain. It\u2019s a bit disappointing \u2013 I was expecting to be able to ride this out.\u201d\nEmily Bitto, the co-owner of Heartattack and Vine, is one such employer who couldn\u2019t afford to make a month of payments for employees to access jobkeeper at her small cafe and wine bar in inner-city Melbourne suburb Carlton.\nThe cafe managed to keep its eight permanent staff, but with the business reduced to a takeaway window and home delivery, revenues are down about 80% and it could not afford to keep 18 casuals.\nBitto says that Heartattack and Vine had 11 casuals eligible for the scheme, but the business would have to pay them $48,000 to cover the first month, before it was reimbursed.\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t have the cash flow to do it without a loan,\u201d she says.\nBendigo Bank offered \u201ca regular sort of loan at 12% interest\u201d.\n\u201cWe considered that but then we realised that because the scheme is continuously paid in arrears, even if we took out that loan to cover the first month, we get that reimbursement, pay back the bank, then we\u2019re essentially in the exact same position for the next month and the next month up until the end of the six-month period where we get the last payment.\u201d\nOn Thursday, the Morrison government offered a stop-gap: the big four banks agreed to set up \u201cdedicated hotlines\u201d for customers calling asking for bridging finance to pay staff ahead of receiving jobkeeper payments.\nBitto said a bank hotline might not help. \u201cI already feel like it\u2019s, not too late, because it goes for six months,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve already missed the boat for the first month.\n\u201cIf you lose two months of the program trying to get that bridging finance it\u2019s an issue.\u201d\nDespite the teething problems, more than 900,000 employers registered their interest in the scheme, and 400,000 businesses covering 2.4m employees have completed applications. Half of those are sole-traders and 90% are microbusinesses.\nAustralian Council of Trade Unions secretary, Sally McManus, says \u201cthe slow uptake of jobkeeper is concerning\u201d.\n\u201cIf workers are missing out on payments because companies are simply choosing to opt out, that\u2019s a serious problem that people can address by applying pressure through their union.\u201d\nOpting to participate in the scheme is just the first hurdle. Employers and employees increasingly find themselves locked in battles about attendance at work and duties while physical distancing restrictions are still in place.\nLuke, a hairdresser in Sydney\u2019s inner west, asked his employer to apply for jobkeeper after the salon shut down in late March.\nWhen the salon reopened last week, Luke offered to work from home, answering phone calls, taking bookings and preparing salon equipment for use but the boss insisted he come back in to work.\nHe refused, citing his roommate\u2019s asthma and his fears that working in close proximity to customers in the personal services industry wasn\u2019t safe.\nLuke is not sure if his employer will pay jobkeeper to other employees or start his payments in May, and will approach the ATO rather than ask his boss.\n\u201cWe stopped \u2026 contact the last week. It really exploded \u2013 our discussion over it \u2013 with the reopening of the salon.\u201d\nLuke says he loves his job and coworkers but \u201cnow that I\u2019ve had this massive disagreement with my boss I feel like I can\u2019t return\u201d.\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost a really good workplace \u2013 in just trying to get \u2026 what I\u2019m owed, or what\u2019s mine.\u201d\nParticipation in the scheme is more complicated than a straight $1,500 payment to workers. Employers can use jobkeeper to pay down leave entitlements until just two weeks of annual leave remain, and Qantas has innovated by using it to pay penalty rates.\nUnions are on the lookout for employers that go beyond pushing the envelope to outright illegal practices, such as paying workers less than $1,500 fortnightly or demanding they repay a portion of jobkeeper, a practice resembling the infamous \u201ccash-back\u201d scam at some 7-Eleven franchise convenience stores.\nNeil said enforcement \u201cwill be very strict\u201d for employers who don\u2019t pass on the full amount, but the epidemic of wage theft has unions worried.\nFrom employers\u2019 perspective, staff expecting to get paid the subsidy not to work is the biggest potential abuse.\nAustralian Industry Group chief executive, Innes Willox, accused \u201csome employees\u201d of \u201ca misguided view that they can choose not to come to work if their employer is accessing the jobkeeper scheme\u201d.\n\u201cIf the employee is not stood down or on approved or authorised leave, the employee must comply with any lawful and reasonable direction given by their employer,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis includes any reasonable and safe direction to carry out work.\u201d\nThe Council of Small Business Organisations Australia, Peter Strong, blames unions, who he claims are \u201cnot being helpful, they\u2019re saying everyone should be allowed to work from home\u201d.\n\u201cEmployers are busting their guts out and the majority of employees are doing the right thing,\u201d Strong says.\n\u201cBut we\u2019re getting enough people saying \u2018you can\u2019t tell me what to do\u2019, \u2018I won\u2019t come to work because it\u2019s unsafe\u2019 \u2013 but then they also say \u2018you can\u2019t tell me what to do at home\u2019 either.\u201d\nMcManus rejects the \u201cbizarre\u201d charge, explaining that \u201cmany businesses just can\u2019t operate at the moment because of the decisions governments have rightly made regarding social distancing to keep us safe\u201d.\nBoth sides hope jobkeeper will be a $130bn lifeline for struggling employees and employers, but in practice it is already bringing out the adversarial nature of the industrial relations system.",

The president wrote the tweet on Saturday evening, when he would usually be taking the podium to address journalists.\nWhat is the purpose of having White House News Conferences when the Lamestream Media asks nothing but hostile questions, & then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately.

Not worth the time & effort!\u201d\nIn recent weeks Trump has used the briefings to dole out unproven and debunked medical advice, suggesting that things like sunlight and an anti-malaria drug are cures to Covid-19, often causing his own medical experts to try to correct the record.\nBut on Friday Trump surprised observers by taking no questions and stalking out of the room after an unusually short briefing of just 22 minutes. Some took the move as an acknowledgement from Trump himself that he may have taken things too far when he said on Thursday that disinfectant could be used to cure Covid-19.\nThose comments sparked shock and ridicule \u2013 and warnings from healthcare experts \u2013 and prompted Trump to make a ham-fisted attempt at a clawback when he later said he had made the remarks sarcastically \u2013 despite video proving he had not.\nWhile the press briefings are meant to give members of the coronavirus task force an opportunity to provide updates on the state of Covid-19 in the country, the attention around the briefings has been centered on Trump\u2019s use of the podium as his bully pulpit.\nThe president has used the briefings as uncensored airtime, praising his administration for its response to the crisis while criticizing the media and Democrats for any negative comeback.\nAdvisers close to the president told him to stop making appearances at the briefings unless special announcements needed to be made, according to multiple reports published Saturday morning. The advice comes as Trump trails Joe Biden in polls from swing states. Perhaps, his advisers believe, because his appearances are overkill.\n\u201cI told him it\u2019s not helping him,\u201d one adviser told Axios. \u201cSeniors are scared. And the spectacle of him fighting with the press isn\u2019t what people want to see.\u201d\nTrump has reportedly been hesitant to end his briefing appearances, Axios reported, because he said they bring in good television ratings.\nThe president has also used the briefings as an opportunity to rile up his base in a way that would typically be done at his rallies. Trump has criticized Democrats and attacked Biden, referring to him as \u201cSleepy Joe\u201d during briefings, veering far away from the subject of Covid-19.\nIt is unclear whether Trump can stay away from the podium, or whether his instincts as a reality television star will kick in and the show will go on.\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to want to get media attention and control his message,\u201d Sam Nunberg, a political consultant who briefly worked on Trump\u2019s campaign in 2016, told Politico. \u201cHe is the only one who thinks he can do his message best, and that\u2019s just the reality.

        "content": "Mike Coupe is preparing to deliver Sainsbury\u2019s annual results on Thursday, his last presentation to investors as head of Britain\u2019s second biggest supermarket chain. After almost six years at the top, the 59-year-old is retiring on 31 May, and will hand over to Simon Roberts, the group\u2019s retail and operations director.\nYou wonder how Roberts might be feeling about that. Few could have predicted the challenges facing the retailer, and the country, when Coupe\u2019s departure was announced in January \u2013 just as Public Health England was declaring that the risk to the British public from coronavirus was low.\nEven for a business that goes back 150 years, Sainsbury\u2019s (and its retail rivals) are dealing with truly historic circumstances, and huge pressure on supply chains. Demand for food in stores and online grocery deliveries has soared as sales of general merchandise and clothing have evaporated among consumers confined to their homes. Sales at food stores rose by more than 10% in March, the strongest showing on record, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nYet Sainsbury\u2019s upcoming results will not show much evidence of that sales boost, given they cover the 12 months to 7 March. It was only in the final fortnight of that period that frantic stockpiling of toilet paper and store-cupboard essentials such as pasta began in the run-up to the government lockdown.\nAnalysts forecast that Sainsbury\u2019s will have made \u00a3584m in underlying profits before tax over the past year \u2013 higher than the previous year, when it was hit by one-off costs related to its attempted merger with Walmart-owned Asda.\nSainsbury\u2019s will also tell its investors how it expects trade to be affected by the lockdown. Supermarkets should be enjoying a purple patch, as consumers queue outside stores and flock online to buy groceries.\nHowever, as competitor Tesco noted in its results this month, higher demand is accompanied by higher costs. Sainsbury\u2019s has had to take on \u201cthousands\u201d of new staff and redeploy workers from its catalogue-retail subsidiary Argos to fill its shelves, while ramping up its online service to meet a 75% increase in demand for delivery slots. The supermarket says it is working with the government to prioritise deliveries for the elderly and vulnerable, even those who haven\u2019t previously shopped with Sainsbury\u2019s.\nThe closure of cafes and restaurants has benefited food retailers, and analysts are optimistic about the outlook for Sainsbury\u2019s share price, although it is currently sitting at about 201p, 14% lower than where it started the year, due to the market turmoil triggered by coronavirus.\nAnalysts and investors will be closely watching the announcement about the retailer\u2019s dividend. The group will be well aware of the criticism that met Tesco\u2019s decision to pay out \u00a3635m to shareholders, having received a similar-sized handout from the government by way of a business rates holiday for the rest of the year.\nSince the coronavirus crisis began, Coupe has become a regular correspondent in his customers\u2019 inboxes, urging them not to stockpile, reassuring them about the availability of groceries and explaining social distancing measures in stores.\nAs his tenure comes to an end, he will be best remembered for the deal he didn\u2019t manage to pull off \u2013 the intended merger with Asda \u2013 rather than the one he did: the acquisition of the catalogue retailer Argos. But although he will probably leave Sainsbury\u2019s with the share price lower than when he took over in 2014, the boost to the supermarket\u2019s online capabilities from the Argos deal may have helped it cope with the virus-induced demand for deliveries.\nThe anticipated recession will bring more challenges for Sainsbury\u2019s under its new boss. Analysts warn that cash-strapped consumers will start searching out cheaper alternatives, and may switch to discounters Aldi and Lidl, while a fall in disposable incomes could hit discretionary spending at Argos. Supermarkets have performed comparatively well during the lockdown, but the longer this crisis drags on, the more difficult it will be for grocers to avoid its economic consequences.",

The global death toll increased to 202,368 on Saturday, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally.\nThe figures for infections are likely to underestimate the true scale of the pandemic because of suspected under-reporting and differing testing regimes. Death toll figures are also controversial, with some countries reporting deaths as confirmed Covid-19 cases on the basis of symptoms and in the absence of a positive test, while others are not including them.\nBoris Johnson will return to work on Monday and is \u201craring to go\u201d, a Downing Street spokeswoman has confirmed. The prime minister has been recovering in his official country residence after spending three nights in intensive care in April. He returns to face a dilemma over whether to ease the coronavirus lockdown, as leading scientists warn that the number of new cases remains much too high.\nGerman police arrested dozens of protesters in Berlin on Saturday for flouting the coronavirus lockdown measures they were demonstrating against. About 1,000 people turned out for the rally, which has become a weekly event in the German capital. Saturday\u2019s protest attracted mainly far-left activists but there were also far-right supporters and members of other fringe groups.\nParaguayan authorities have laid out details of a plan to begin lifting the country\u2019s total quarantine. Health minister Julio Mazzoleni announced at a press conference on Friday that a new \u201cintelligent quarantine\u201d will begin on 4 May. It will gradually reintroduce public freedoms and economic activities through a four-stage plan set to run until early July.\nThe UK\u2019s biggest steel producer needs about \u00a3500m in government support to see it through the coronavirus crisis, according to Welsh MP Stephen Kinnock. Tata Steel has reportedly approached the UK and Welsh governments for a bailout after its big European customers halted production. The company employs 8,385 people across the UK, including more than 4,000 workers at the Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales.\nSpain could lift more lockdown restrictions and allow adults out to exercise from 2 May if efforts to contain the spread of the virus continue to pay off, the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has said. The strict lockdown enacted after the declaration of a state of emergency on 14 March has been extended until 9 May, but children under the age of 14 will be allowed out for an hour\u2019s exercise each day from Sunday.\nAddressing the nation on Saturday night, S\u00e1nchez said: \u201cIf things keep going in a positive direction with the pandemic, from 2 May people will be allowed out to exercise individually or to go out for a walk with the person they live with.\u201d\nAs rumours of Kim Jong-un\u2019s death circulate on social media, one news agency has suggested that he may be sheltering from Covid-19 in a North Korean resort town. On Friday, South Korean news agency Newsis said that a special train for Kim\u2019s use had been spotted by intelligence sources in the town of Wonsan.\nA Washington-based North Korea monitoring project called 38 North has captured satellite images that also appear to show a special train, possibly belonging to the North Korean leader, in Wonsan. Though the group said it was probably Kim Jong-un\u2019s train, Reuters has not been able to confirm that independently, or whether he was in Wonsan.",

The site said the train appeared to have been repositioned for departure on the latter date, but added that there had been no indication of when it might leave. The station is reserved for the use of the Kim family, it added.\n\u201cThe train\u2019s presence does not prove the whereabouts of the North Korean leader or indicate anything about his health but it does lend weight to reports that Kim is staying at an elite area on the country\u2019s eastern coast,\u201d the 38 North report said.\nSpeculation about Kim\u2019s health grew quickly following his absence from the anniversary of the birthday of North Korea\u2019s founding father and Kim\u2019s grandfather, Kim Il-sung, on 15 April. On Saturday, Kim missed another national holiday, North Korea\u2019s Military Foundation Day, further fuelling speculation about his health.\nAccording to a report in Newsweek, US intelligence has seen no sign of unusual military activity in the country but are continuing to monitor the situation closely.\nNewsweek quoted a senior unnamed Pentagon official as saying: \u201cWe have observed no indications or received any additional information to make a conclusive assessment on the status of North Korean leadership or health of Kim Jong-un.\u201d\nBut the official went on to say the presence of the train in Wonsan and Kim\u2019s absence from recent events lent credibility to reports that he was ill. Kim\u2019s status meant North Korea could conceivably delay announcing his death to ensure security measures were in place, the official said.\nNorth Korea\u2019s state media last reported on Kim\u2019s whereabouts when he presided over a meeting of the ruling party\u2019s politburo on 11 April.\nOn Friday, Reuters reported that had China dispatched a team of medical experts and officials to North Korea to advise on Kim.\nSouth Korea\u2019s government has dismissed reports that Kim is seriously ill, saying last week that he appeared to be handling state affairs normally and that there had been no suspicious activities, such as an emergency readiness order issued by the North\u2019s military or the ruling Workers\u2019 party.\nSome South Korean media outlets, citing unidentified government officials, have reported that Kim was staying at Wonsan, located about 200km east of the capital, Pyongyang. The broadcaster TBS said last Thursday that Kim had been in the resort for the previous four days and would soon make a reappearance.\nNorth Korea\u2019s state media has not commented on Kim\u2019s health or offered clues as to his whereabouts. On Sunday, state radio said he had sent a message of thanks to building workers in a northern border town but did not say when or offer any other details, according to South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency.\nKim\u2019s two-week absence from public life has sparked speculation among North Korean defectors living in the South.\nAccording to the Korea Times, Ji Seong-ho, a defector who won a seat in last week\u2019s national assembly elections in the South, claimed a source inside North Korea had confirmed to him that Kim was \u201cseriously ill\u201d and that the country was in the grip of a succession struggle.\nBut Thae Yong-ho, the most senior North Korean diplomat to have defected, said it was impossible to speculate about the state of Kim\u2019s health.\nThae, a former North Korean deputy ambassador to the UK who also won a national assembly seat, said: \u201cThe supreme leader\u2019s whereabouts are protected with intense secrecy, so very few people know these details. Considering the gravity of the situation, it is impossible for news of his poor health to spread to the border with China.\u201d\nKim, who came to power after the death in 2011 of his father, Kim Jong-il, has no clear successor, and a prolonged power vacuum is certain to raise international concerns about the security of the country\u2019s nuclear arsenal.\nKim\u2019s younger sister, Kim Yo-jong, has recently emerged as a powerful force within the regime, while other possible candidates include premier Kim Jae-ryong, who conducted a number of site visits around the country on Friday.\nDonald Trump has played down reports that Kim is ill. \u201cI think the report was incorrect,\u201d Trump told reporters on Friday, but declined to say if he had been in contact with North Korean officials.\nTrump has met his \u201cfriend\u201d Kim three times in an attempt to persuade him to abandon his nuclear weapons. Under Kim, North Korea has developed missiles capable of reaching the US mainland, but denuclearisation talks remain deadlocked.\nReporting from inside North Korea is notoriously difficult because of tight controls on information. A Trump administration official said days of North Korean media silence on Kim\u2019s whereabouts had heightened concerns about his condition.\nOn Monday, Daily NK, a Seoul-based website that reports on North Korea, cited one unnamed source in North Korea as saying that Kim had undergone heart surgery in the resort county of Hyangsan, north of Pyongyang, on 12 April.\nKim, believed to be 36, has disappeared from coverage in North Korean state media before. In 2014, he vanished for more than a month amid rumours about his heath. North Korean state TV later showed him walking with a limp.\nSpeculation about Kim\u2019s health has been fuelled by his heavy smoking and weight gain since taking power. His family also has a history of cardiovascular problems.\nIf Kim Jong-un dies or is incapacitated, the North Korean regime would have little time to prepare for a smooth transition of power. But who might replace him?\nKim Yo-jong\nThe most obvious candidate is Kim\u2019s younger sister, Kim Yo-jong, who has been his most trusted confidante over the past year, accompanying him to nuclear summits and advising him on his image, both at home and during his diplomatic engagement with the US and South Korea.\nYo-jong would become the fourth member of her family to rule North Korea, part of a powerful cult of personality built around the family\u2019s mythical Mount Paektu bloodline \u2013 a reference to the country\u2019s highest, and most revered, mountain.\nBut some experts have said military and party elites could oppose the appointment of a woman as supreme leader, given the country\u2019s strong patriarchal principles.\nChoe Ryong-hae\nAn alternative scenario would be a collective leadership, possibly with Yo-jong as a figurehead at the outset, but stripped of the absolute power enjoyed by her brother, father and grandfather.\n A collective leadership would most likely be led by Choe Ryong-hae, North Korea\u2019s ceremonial head of state and the country\u2019s official second-in-command.\n Choe, however, is not a member of the Kim family, so his elevation could prompt questions over his legitimacy and trigger a power struggle, plunging the country into chaos.Kim Pyong-il\nAnother candidate is Kim Pyong-il, Kim Jong-il\u2019s 65-year-old half-brother, who spent decades in Europe as a diplomat and whose age and experience could make him more acceptable to other senior officials.\n This article was amended on 4 May 2020 to remove a reference to Kim Yo-jong possibly becoming the \u201cfourth generation\u201d of her family to rule North Korea; she would be the fourth family member.",

        "content": "The co-leader of New Zealand\u2019s Green party is uneasy with power, but is embracing the chance to make a difference \nWhen Marama Davidson, ahead of an official trip to New Zealand\u2019s Hawkes Bay, found out that low-income families living in motels there would be evicted to make way for visiting dignitaries like her, she refused to be part of it.\nAfter Davidson \u2013 co-leader of the left-leaning Green party that is part of New Zealand\u2019s power-sharing government led by Jacinda Ardern\u2019s Labour \u2013 saw the headlines, she cancelled the booking and packed a tent in her suitcase instead.\n\u201cThey were kicking people out of motels that were being used for emergency housing,\u201d she says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, I hate that we\u2019ve got people living in motels, but I don\u2019t want to be the reason for them to live in the car for a week.\u2019\u201d\nDavidson had an even better time at the campground during the trip to visit the M\u0101ori performing arts festival Te Matatini, she says. The young performers and their families were staying there too; she fixed her hair and makeup for official events in the communal bathroom block alongside them and \u201cwas stealing all their babies\u201d while groups rehearsed.\n\u201cCamping is my deal,\u201d Davidson, 46, says. So are the arts; her father is the actor Rawiri Paratene and her mother an activist; she was raised at the heart of a kind of M\u0101ori cultural renaissance \u2013 political, linguistic, creative \u2013 with some of New Zealand\u2019s most towering Indigenous writers, artists and agitators as her doting babysitters. Leadership was natural; parliamentary politics was not.\nWhen the Guardian visited her office in the capital, Wellington, in February \u2013 before parliament closed for the national lockdown intended to eliminate Covid-19 from New Zealand \u2013 Davidson was barefoot and dispensing hugs to anyone who arrived.\nThere is tension between her idealism and her pragmatism in the story about sleeping in a tent while on official business. \u201cI understand that we need to solve the systemic issue and me camping for two nights does not solve the systemic issue,\u201d she says. \u201cI got all that.\u201d\nIt is also reflective of the Greens\u2019 uneasy relationship with power: the party of activists and environmentalists returned its best electoral results while in opposition against the previous centre-right government, and the current electoral term is the first time the party \u2013 with its eight parliamentarians \u2013 has been part of the ruling group.\nBut the trade-off for the discomfort, Davidson says, are policies such as the one she was shortly to announce: a plan to reduce the housing agency\u2019s reliance on motel rooms for emergency accommodation for the homeless, and to build more short-term housing for those on New Zealand\u2019s longest-ever public housing waiting list, at a cost of $300m.\n\u201cEssentially, we are operating in a system which goes against our values,\u201d she says of the Green party. Parliament is \u201ca little, insulated bubble of disconnection,\u201d inhabited by a \u201chostile\u201d politics.\n\u201cBut if I wasn\u2019t here, if we weren\u2019t here, people would be missing out on the difference that we are making,\u201d she adds. That will be the pitch for the Green party at September\u2019s election, Davidson says: telling stories about what its lawmakers did when they touched the levers of power.\nShe mentions bolstered protections for victims of domestic abuse, safeguards for water and the environment, collective M\u0101ori approaches to Indigenous matters. Her party has to prove it\u2019s not just \u201csimilar to Labour\u201d in order to survive.\nThat was in February; by April, New Zealand had been shut down in the government\u2019s efforts to combat the coronavirus and Davidson\u2019s parliamentary world had collided, hard, with her refuge at home where time \u201con the couch with my babies\u201d is prized.\nThe household \u201cbubble\u201d in self-isolation at her South Auckland home numbers eight people: Davidson, her husband of more than 20 years, her eldest daughter and three youngest children, her son-in-law and her baby granddaughter. Two other adult children live nearby. Davidson is working \u201c14 to 16 hour\u201d days in politics, representing the Green party on a parliamentary committee set up to scrutinise the government\u2019s response to the virus. She seeks refuge from the chaos in the garage, or with her laptop balanced atop a stack of books on two bar stools in the bedroom.\n\u201cOn the one hand I\u2019ve been able to put my children to bed every night and that has been an absolute luxury for me,\u201d she says, adding that in order to spend time with her family in the evenings, she is often still working at 2am.\nPolitics is emphatically not \u201cfor life\u201d for Davidson, but her husband and children agreed that the chance to lead a political party was worth the sacrifice.\n\u201cI think what helps us all get through as a family is going, \u2018Holy crap, what an opportunity this is for me, for them, for us,\u2019\u201d she says.\nDavidson has helmed the party jointly with Shaw since 2018, after the spectacular downfall of her friend, the former co-leader Metiria Turei \u2013 the woman who \u201cshowed me that it was possible to be in this space and still operate as authentically as I can,\u201d Davidson says.\nTurei resigned her post after a media furore when she volunteered that she had claimed larger benefits than she was entitled to as a young mother on social welfare. Her point about the difficulties of survival on welfare in New Zealand was drowned out by rancour over her wrongdoing, but Davidson says Turei\u2019s \u201cbravery\u201d had \u201cchanged the narrative\u201d about poverty in New Zealand.\nJournalists who ask her about welfare payment increases these days, she says, are on the side of the beneficiaries. But when Davidson learned the woman who mentored her into politics was stepping aside less than two months before the 2017 election , she had \u201ca very raw moment of grief and feeling quite bewildered as to whether I could carry on\u201d.\n\u201cThe way I reconciled it was: \u2018Do the work. Get it done,\u2019\u201d she recalls. She cried in her car outside a campaign event. Less than a year later, she was the party\u2019s co-leader.\nBefore Turei had urged her into politics, Davidson worked at New Zealand\u2019s human rights commission for a decade. Her penchant for activism, combined with an absence of ministerial portfolios allows Davidson more flexibility to petition the government than she might otherwise have.\nHer best-known stand came as an opposition MP when she was thrown out of parliament for objecting to the then-prime minister John Key\u2019s accusation that his opponents supported \u201crapists.\u201d She stood in the debating chamber and referred to her own sexual assault; the demand that she leave prompted a walk-out in support from other lawmakers, many of whom said they had been assaulted too.\nShe spoke further about the abuse, which had happened when she was a young child, on a news podcast in 2018. It generated a huge outpouring \u2013 talkback callers, messages, headlines \u2013 of support and recognition.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to affect you until you see it in broad daylight out in the world,\u201d Davidson says, of sharing the story. \u201cAnd then I saw I saw it all around the place and then I was like, \u2018What have I done? What have I done?\u2019 And I felt raw and overexposed.\u201d\nHer activism had always been personal, but this was \u201cone of the most deeply personal things,\u201d she says, because she had carried not anger, but shame, about the incidents.\n\u201cThis is mine. And now everyone else has got it,\u201d she thought at the time. It prompted a scary, but ultimately cathartic, phone call with her father, who had not known the details of the episodes.\n\u201cI was like\u2026 \u2018Forget it\u2019s out there. It\u2019s out there. I\u2019ve got my dad. I\u2019ve got my whole family,\u201d Davidson says. \u201cI am invincible. I\u2019m done. We\u2019re good.\u201d\nIn the remote parliamentary committee hearings she participates in while the Covid-19 lockdown rolls on, Davidson often asks the captains of industry and government ministers about the plight of low-wage workers after the crisis ends.\nBut she does not believe, as some of her parliamentary colleagues do, that the country will have to choose between jobs and wellbeing.\n\u201cI do have to continue to both reject that narrative and put up the new, the better story.\u201d",

An app for tracing contacts of confirmed cases is also due to be unveiled. Seventeen priorities have been identified \u2013 these include reopening schools, companies returning to work, getting public transport back to normal, the supply of masks and sanitiser, policies on testing, and support for the elderly.\nBeijing\u2019s city government has banned \u201cuncivilised\u201d behaviour such as not covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, in a new set of regulations to improve public hygiene and combat the coronavirus. Rule-breakers will be slapped with fines for offences including not wearing a mask in public when ill, and citizens must also \u201cdress neatly\u201d in public and not go shirtless \u2013 an apparent reference to the so-called \u201cBeijing bikini\u201d, in which men roll T-shirts up to expose their stomachs in hot weather.\nThe World Health Organization has warned against \u201cimmunity passports\u201d for recovered patients, seen as a possible tool for countries preparing to reopen their economies. \u201cThere is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection,\u201d said a WHO statement.\nReports have emerged that Donald Trump\u2019s administration is considering replacing its secretary of health and human services, Alex Azar, because of early missteps in the handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The Wall Street Journal, which cited six people familiar with the discussions, said frustration with Azar was growing but the administration was reluctant to make big changes while the country was seeking to stop the virus, which has killed more than 53,000 people in the US. A White House spokesman told the newspaper that there was no plan to replace Azar.\nMexico\u2019s health ministry on Saturday reported 970 new cases of coronavirus infection and 84 additional fatalities, bringing the total in the country to 13,842 cases and 1,305 deaths. The government has said the real number of infected people is likely considerably higher than the confirmed cases.\nAs rumours about the health of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un continue to circulate, including reports that he is sheltering from Covid-19, a US-based monitoring group released satellite images of what may have been his train parked at an exclusive resort town in the country\u2019s east.\nA preliminary report, cited by Australia\u2019s chief medical officer as the government advocates the reopening of the country\u2019s schools, says children are unlikely to transmit Covid-19 between each other or to adults. The study, which is still be peer reviewed, was conducted by the Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance (NCIRS). It examined transmission of the virus in New South Wales schools and childcare centres between March and mid-April.\nState media in Saudi Arabia are reporting that the curfew will be partially lifted for all regions starting Sunday, but that a 24-hour curfew will be maintained in Mecca, according to Reuters. Some economic and commercial activities, including retail stores, will be reopened during Ramadan, from 29 April to 13 May.\nAustralia\u2019s coronavirus tracing app was set to launch on Sunday, despite lingering privacy concerns. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, confirmed downloading the app would not be mandatory, and instead has likened it to a civic duty, such as buying war bonds in the second world war. He also flagged it as a necessary step to relaxing restrictions.\nBoris Johnson will return to work on Monday and is \u201craring to go\u201d, a Downing Street spokeswoman has confirmed. The prime minister has been recovering in his official country residence after spending three nights in intensive care in April. He returns to face a dilemma over whether to ease the coronavirus lockdown, as leading scientists warn that the number of new cases remains much too high.",

        "content": "The US model of capitalism is deeply flawed. It is highly unequal, and an inadequate welfare system means that millions of people are either living in poverty or constantly teetering on the edge. Citizens of the EU have it cushier, with more generous pensions, unemployment pay and in-work benefits.\nBut as the events of the past month or so have shown with brutal clarity, in a crisis the American system works better. It is more flexible, more innovative and much faster to act. The Federal Reserve in Washington has acted more speedily and provided more stimulus than the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, but the contrast has been even more marked when it comes to fiscal policy \u2013 the tax and spending measures for which governments are responsible.\nLast week saw yet another can-kicking exercise by EU leaders, who have been at odds for weeks over whether to issue common bonds in response to the economic devastation caused by Covid-19. The matter now looks as if, with luck, it might be finally resolved in early June, but that\u2019s a long time in the current circumstances.\nDelay is potentially disastrous, for two obvious reasons: the parlous state of the EU economy requires an immediate coordinated response; and the lack of unity puts at risk the goal of ever-closer union.\nIt is not as if the countries that are blocking the mutualisation of debt through coronabonds are doing especially well. The latest survey of German business sentiment was dire, and the outlook will remain so until there is a pick-up in demand for the country\u2019s exports. This, though, does not seem to have forced Angela Merkel to rethink her opposition to coronabonds, which remains resolute whatever the circumstances.\nThis is not the way things work in the US. Policy is driven by events, not dogma, and as a result is far more creative. So while it was Groundhog Day in Europe, Congress was passing a fresh stimulus bill and the US treasury was doing its utmost to ensure that loans promised to small businesses were actually delivered.\nThere is a pattern here. In 2008-09, the Fed moved more quickly than the ECB to cut interest rates and to introduce the money-creation scheme known as quantitative easing. President Barack Obama\u2019s stimulus package would ideally have been bigger, but it was better than the fetish for fiscal discipline that the EU insisted on. Moreover, it didn\u2019t take long for the Americans to work out that the economy would never really recover unless the banking system was cleaned up. It took years for the Europeans to twig this, which is why the US went into the current crisis with its banks in relatively good health and the EU did not.\nIndeed, there are justifiable fears about how Italian and \u2013 to a lesser extent \u2013 German banks will withstand the sort of bad-loan losses that look all too likely given the impact of the lockdown on business activity. That\u2019s another reason why the hardliners in Germany and the Netherlands need to think again about coronabonds.\nNo question, the US system has its drawbacks. The lack of a proper social safety net is the main reason Donald Trump is desperate to get the economy out of hibernation, and moving too rapidly could easily backfire.\nBut, as things stand, history is about to repeat itself. As in 2008-09, all developed economies will go into a deep recession, but the US will rebound first and fastest. Europe\u2019s timidity will result in deeper scars. Last time they were just economic. This time they could be political too.\nIt should not require a pandemic for the business \u201celite\u201d to realise that Davos should be junked from the corporate calendar. The World Economic Forum\u2019s annual shindig became a laughing stock a long time ago. All those denunciations of global inequality, when made by corporate captains clinking champagne glasses in a Swiss ski resort at shareholders\u2019 expense, are ridiculous.\nThe penny finally seems to be dropping, for which we should give modest thanks. Standard Life Aberdeen, the FTSE 100 asset manager, says its executives won\u2019t go next time and it will allocate its \u00a33m budget \u2013 yes, really \u2013 to something more useful.\n\u201cWEF has done a lot of good over the years,\u201d claimed its chief executive, Keith Skeoch, contentiously, in an email to staff last Friday, \u201cbut I believe we should focus our efforts and resources closer to home in the locations where we operate around the world. The money will be directed to high-impact community projects to provide relief to people most in need.\u201d\nOne of the WEF\u2019s thin justifications for the existence for Davos is that a gathering of politicians and business leaders helps to create global responses to global risks. The evidence for such a claim was always hard to spot, but never more so than now. Lack of international cooperation has been a defining feature of the world\u2019s early response to the spread of Covid-19.\nCome next January, attendance by corporate bosses at Davos will be very hard to defend. The global economy, almost certainly, will still be depressed. The fleets of corporate jets at Swiss airports, carrying millionaires and billionaires anxious to express their concern over the climate emergency, will be more offensive than usual.\nStandard Life Aberdeen is the first major name to pull out. It won\u2019t be the last. Try teleconferencing.\nCommercial landlords know they\u2019re never going to win a popularity contest. And, after a quarter of century of comfortable growth in rental income, during which time some spectacularly ugly shopping centres were built, nor should they.\nBut landlords also make a fair point in the current Covid-19 stand-off over rents: if a tenant can afford to pay, it should. That, formally, is also the government\u2019s position. It\u2019s just that Alok Sharma, the business secretary, seems to have created a free-for-all in his attempt to curtail some landlords\u2019 strong-arm tactics on rent collection.\nThe reasoning behind the government\u2019s temporary ban on winding-up orders is fair enough: most high street shops are shut and those companies at risk of collapse should be given some financial breathing space. But then Sharma followed up with a woolly call for other tenants to \u201cpay what they can in recognition of the strains felt by commercial landlords too\u201d.\nThat loose wording is an open invitation for even strong retailers to try their luck. Boots, the chemists\u2019 chain, says it has \u201cpaused some payments\u201d in the hope of reaching a \u201cfair\u201d agreement with some of its biggest landlords. Why? It\u2019s not even remotely in the struggling camp.\nBoots is part of the enormous Walgreens Boots Alliance empire, valued on the US Nasdaq market at $38bn. Most of its UK shops are open, as the pharmacies are classed as an essential service. Footfall may be down 65% but, on the other hand, Boots benefits from the government\u2019s scrapping of business rates for retail, leisure and hospitality firms this year. It can clearly afford to fulfil its contractual obligation to pay its rent in full, on time.\nIn practice, landlords will probably lose most of these skirmishes since their biggest fear is empty space, and retail rents were falling anyway before the crisis. But some tenants are exploiting the situation. For a change, a slice of sympathy for landlords is in order.",

Hundreds of thousands of images from our collection are now available on Rijksstudio to view, download, print, turn into puzzles \u2026 Our best-known artwork is Rembrandt\u2019s The Night Watch: catch up with the current restoration project at Operation Night Watch, or take a virtual tour of the museum with our free app.\nWe have started doing some things specially for the lockdown, such as Masterpieces Up Close, an interactive platform exploring 18 paintings, including Vermeer\u2019s The Milkmaid. We\u2019re also producing three-minute video talks by curators \u2013 mine will be about 19th-century British amateur photographer Anna Atkins: the first person to come up with the idea of putting photographs in a book, she took striking cyanotype images of plants, which look like modern art, and it took her 10 years (1843-1853) to make her books by hand.\nThe Van Gogh Museum has lots of ways to enjoy the museum at home, such as reading Vincent\u2019s letters or using the Unravel Van Gogh app, for details you can\u2019t see with the naked eye. At the Anne Frank House, virtual visitors can look around the Secret Annex online. The Stedelijk Museum of modern art is streaming live tours of its permanent collection and one of its temporary exhibitions, such as the new show by Korean video artist Nam June Paik, every Friday at 2pm; the tours are then available on Facebook and YouTube.\nAnd outside of the city\u2019s museums, sightseeing company Stromma is working on a virtual cruise along the city\u2019s canals.\nA writer who gives a good introduction to the city is Nescio, pen name of Jan Hendrik Frederik Gr\u00f6nloh (1883-1961), who is famous in the Netherlands. He wrote novellas and short stories about penniless artists and poets, mostly before or during the first world war. His work wasn\u2019t translated into English until 2012, and is published as Amsterdam Stories.\nI also recommend two photographers \u2013 some of their images are on the City Archives website. The first is George Hendrik Breitner (1857-1923), who walked the streets of Amsterdam for years, taking snapshots. His fascinating body of work is the best record we have of the city from that period.\nThe second is Ed van der Elsken (1925-1990), a street photographer and film-maker. He is best-known for Love on the Leftbank, his photobook of Paris, but he also took great portraits of 1950s Amsterdam. Martin Parr is a big fan. Breitner and Elsken are the two best guides you could have to the streets of Amsterdam.\nMy Rembrandt, a 2019 documentary by Oeke Hoogendijk, is a fascinating story about various people and their relationship with the artist. It is partly set in Amsterdam, and you can watch it online, for example on mubi.com. By contrast, The Hitman\u2019s Bodyguard is a recent Amsterdam-based comedy-thriller starring Samuel L Jackson and Ryan Reynolds.\nRamses Shaffy (1933-2009) was the country\u2019s most famous singer and actor. He was born in France \u2013 his mother was a Polish-Russian countess, his father an Egyptian diplomat \u2013 and lived in Amsterdam for much of his life. Most of his songs are in Dutch, but they are still enjoyable for English speakers. He was a fan of French chanteurs, and that shows.\nAnd while live music is off the agenda, watch past performances of classical music on the Royal Concertgebouw\u2019s website\nThis article includes content provided by Instagram.

One of the few traditional Dutch dishes we cook in my house is a kind of comfort food called stamppot. You boil potatoes with one or more other vegetables (carrots, endive, kale, onions), then drain, add hot milk and mash. We serve it with smoked sausage and pickles.\nWe drink a lot of beer in the Netherlands, so visit virtually with a Dutch beer. Heineken is the most famous, but there are lots of small breweries in Amsterdam, such as Brouwerij \u2019t Ij. We also like making home brew \u2013 a good activity during lockdown. And jenever, Dutch gin, is having a revival among young people. They drink it neat, but it\u2019s strong, so you should eat something with it! It goes well with beef sausages, cheese and mustard.",

But despite a growing clamour for coffee chains to make their cups more environment-friendly, the vast majority are used only once, which critics say is a considerable waste of natural resources.\nOne company vying to produce a truly recyclable alternative claims that the UK\u2019s caffeine addiction is responsible for the felling of a million trees a year. An independent study it commissioned suggests that almost 1.5 billion litres of water go into making the cups the UK uses annually.\nThe study, by product-testing company Intertek, claims to be the first to measure the environmental impact of producing, using and disposing of all types of single-use coffee cup. It found that a typical cup requires 0.58 litres of water to produce and has a carbon footprint equivalent to up to 60.9 grammes of carbon dioxide.\nA 2017 report from the UK\u2019s House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee found that only one in 400 cups end up being recycled, with the vast majority going straight to landfill. This suggests that coffee cups that end up in the UK\u2019s landfill sites produce an annual carbon footprint equivalent to over 152,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide, similar to what 33,300 cars produce in a year.\nThe audit committee called on the government to set a target to recycle all single-use cups by 2023. It said: \u201cIf an effective recycling system is not established\u2026 by this date, the government should ban disposable coffee cups.\u201d\nBut a major issue for the industry is that even cups promoted as compostable cannot be recycled conventionally. They have to be transported by lorry to one of the UK\u2019s 53 high-temperature industrial composting facilities, which increases their carbon footprint.\n\u201cThe problem with conventional, coated and compostable cups is that they\u2019re all made from virgin paper, and the laminated plastic coating is very hard to remove,\u201d said Malcolm Waugh, chief executive of Frugalpac, an Ipswich-based company that produces an alternative called the Frugal Cup, which is made almost totally from recycled paper, and which funded the study.\n\u201cOur answer was to redesign the cup by scrapping the laminated virgin paperboard and instead make the cup out of 96% recycled paper with no waterproofing chemicals, and then lightly attach a separately made plastic food grade liner. Not perfect yet but a damn sight better than the alternatives.\u201d\nWaugh predicted that using cups made from recycled paper would save a million trees a year in Britain and more than 200 million worldwide.\nProducing a truly recyclable coffee cup is a key issue for environmental groups. The WWF forecasts that by 2030 the UK will use 33% more cups than it does now.\nSome major chains are starting to act. Last month, Starbucks announced that it is trialling NextGen compostable cups, which are made without the polyethylene lining that makes normal cups hard to recycle.",

A crowdfunding page to support the challenge was due to go live on Saturday night.\nThe row threatens to become a major embarrassment for the government. The Telegraph has reported that Cygnus\u2019s findings were deemed \u201ctoo terrifying\u201d to be made public.\nLast week, the Observer revealed that minutes of the government\u2019s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group suggested the report had included four key recommendations, including one that the department of health strengthen the surge capability, and capacity of hospitals to cope with a pandemic.\nA freedom of information request to see the report has been refused.\nQureshi argues that there is exceptionally strong public interest in publication of the report, given that its lessons and recommendations are \u201cdirectly relevant\u201d to the procedures developed to combat Covid-19.\n\u201cThere is no persuasive argument for secrecy when managing a healthcare crisis,\u201d Qureshi said. \u201cSuccessful science and healthcare depend on transparency, peer review, collaboration and engagement with the public.\n\u201cI believe that if the government had followed the Cygnus exercise by engaging transparently with health and social care partners, with industry and the public, then many of the deaths of my heroic healthcare colleagues and the wider public during the Covid-19 pandemic could have been avoided.\u201d\nTessa Gregory, a solicitor at Leigh Day, said: \u201cOur client believes that the NHS workforce and wider public have a right to know what Exercise Cygnus revealed about what needed to be done to keep NHS staff and the public safe in a pandemic.\n\u201cIt beggars belief that the information the exercise revealed is being kept hidden when a public debate about its contents may well inform important decisions about how to best protect lives going forward.\u201d\nA spokeswoman for the Department of Health said that she could not comment \u201cbecause of the legal procedures in place\u201d.",

        "content": "UK will need extension to agree Brexit deal as pandemic derails talks\nBoris Johnson must extend the UK\u2019s transition out of the EU for up to two years to avoid compounding the economic damage of the coronavirus pandemic with a hugely disruptive and disorderly Brexit, according to a close ally of Angela Merkel.\nIn an interview with the Observer, Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, chair of the Bundestag\u2019s foreign affairs committee, said it was now impossible to see how the UK and other EU countries could agree even a minimal outline free trade agreement this year because the talks were so behind schedule.\nThe transition period is due to end on 31 December unless the UK asks for a prolongation by 30 June. The maximum extension would be two years, under the terms of the withdrawal agreement. R\u00f6ttgen said he could not see any sensible option other than for the UK to apply for the extension to avoid even more damage to the British and European economies. On Friday, Michel Barnier said there had been \u201climited progress\u201d in the initial stages of \u201cvirtual\u201d negotiations, which he said was disappointing.\nR\u00f6ttgen, a member of Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union party, said: \u201cBefore the current coronavirus crisis, I think it would have been possible to have a minimum agreement with the UK on the broad outlines to avoid a crash [the UK crashing out with no deal], with more detailed negotiations then taking place afterwards.\n \u201cI can\u2019t imagine now that this is possible, given the fact that all the EU countries, Brussels and London are so absorbed by the pandemic \u2013 and this will go on. Given this situation, I don\u2019t believe that there is a realistic possibility any longer to even achieve the necessary minimum. So you have to extend.\u201d\nBut he said it would be up to Boris Johnson to realise the consequences of a disorderly exit amid this pandemic.\n\u201cThe pandemic will cause more economic damage than we can now imagine. To think that you could then add to this extraordinary situation a very disorderly exit, to me is not imaginable. I think everyone will say that this is not in the British interest or in the interest of any of us.\u201d\nThe Brexit transition began when the UK left the EU on 31 January. The arrangement \u2013 under which the UK is outside the EU but continues to be subject to its rules and a member of the single market and customs union \u2013 was negotiated by both sides to smooth the UK\u2019s exit.\nThe transition was also designed to allow the UK to continue much of its previous relationship with the EU while the fine details of a future trading relationship and security co-operation were negotiated.\nBarnier cited an alarming lack of progress in four of the most crucial areas of the talks. Sources said he was greatly frustrated that the UK did not appear ready either to discuss detail or make compromises.\nThe four areas of difference were the so-called \u201clevel playing field\u201d (the extent to which the UK would adopt EU standards to have access to the single market); fisheries, particularly EU access to UK waters; security co-operation and governance issues.\nThe German MEP David McAllister, who chairs the UK co-ordination in the European Parliament (correct) said both sides were now \u201cunder enormous time pressure to organise a half-way orderly exit of the UK from the single market and the customs union.\u201d\nIt had been hoped that an outline deal could be concluded over the coming months, in time for it to be signed off over the summer by EU leaders. But talks between the UK and EU sides are well behind schedule, although the second set of discussions, effected by video link, ended last week.\nEU officials have said that concluding deals on such complex issues \u2013 already a lengthy and tortuous process \u2013 is far more difficult without face-to-face meetings. One high-level EU source said: \u201cYou can get so far but what you can\u2019t do is go away into small groups of six or eight people in a dark room and hammer out the final, vital details. That is not possible in a virtual meeting.\u201d\nThe UK is also understood to have redeployed some of its staff who were posted to the EU trade talks to coronavirus duties since the Covid-19 pandemic developed.\nThe issue of whether to apply for an extension is now emerging as a huge additional problem for Johnson, who prides himself on having \u201cgot Brexit done\u201d. Until now, Downing Street has said it will not contemplate asking the EU for an extension under any circumstances.\nTo do so, Johnson would have to reverse legislation that, in effect, bars him from seeking an extension, and he would have to agree additional financial contributions to the EU to pay for that extension.\nAnother senior EU politician involved in the talks said there were signs of division appearing on the UK side, with some civil servants and Tory MPs believing the UK had to find a way to abandon its opposition to extending the transition: \u201cI think there is a recognition by some on the UK side that they have to extend but no one knows how to do it. The question is what Johnson will decide when he returns to Downing Street after his illness. It is a big political problem for them.\u201d\nThe terms of the withdrawal agreement allow a UK\u2013EU joint committee to extend the transition period by up to two years, but it must sign off on the length of any extension before 1 July. EU lawyers say that once that window is missed, EU law makes it very difficult to agree to any extension.\nCharles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, who is regularly in touch with diplomats in EU capitals, said: \u201cIt will be very hard for both sides to reach the outlines of a free trade agreement by autumn, or indeed by June, which is when the PM wants to take a decision on whether it is worth pursuing a free trade agreement.\n\u201cLast week should have been the fifth round of negotiations, but it was the second. The bottom line is that on both sides the top politicians\u2019 attention is focused on coronavirus, not Brexit, which makes a deal in the short term highly unlikely.\u201d",

A series of delays and U-turns cost time \u2013 and the country could pay a price for months to come\nThe pay-and-display sign still marks the entrance to the Milton Keynes coronavirus testing hub \u2013 a cluster of tents in a car park across from a shuttered Toys R Us shop \u2013 that is the heart of the UK\u2019s drive to contain and control the disease.\nOn Friday afternoon a queue of about 20 cars had formed up on the road outside, carrying key workers from schools, hospitals and care homes.\nMen in high-vis jackets working for the accountancy giant Deloitte, which runs the centre, patrolled the street and tried to clear it of anyone not coming to be tested, even though they admitted they had no legal authority to do so.\nThose who had arrived had been given the postcode to put into their satnavs but there were almost no signposts to the hub on nearby ring roads or streets, perhaps to keep it a secret from curious locals or passersby.\nLess than 24 hours earlier, the health secretary, Matt Hancock \u2013 desperate to \u201cramp up\u201d testing (and then contact tracing) in the hope of getting somewhere near his target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April \u2013 had announced that all key workers with symptoms could apply to be checked for coronavirus.\nHuge pent-up demand from people would defeat the system within hours of it going live. On Friday morning the testing website could not cope and it told applicants that there were no more tests available, an administrative hitch for which the government swiftly apologised.\nThose in the queue on the outskirts of Milton Keynes had, however, logged on before the crash. Several told the Observer they wanted tests as much for their patients, or the people they worked and lived with, as for themselves. Many had signed up in the small hours, including a school key worker who had gone online at 2am to register.\n\u201cI work around Covid patients, although we wear full PPE,\u201d said one nurse who asked not to be named. \u201cThis is the first opportunity we\u2019ve had to get tested. It\u2019s for my patients as well as myself, so I don\u2019t risk infecting them.\u201d She had travelled with her sister who works in care, and her parents who are isolating with them. Their father\u2019s diabetes makes him a high risk if he contracts Covid-19.\nOnce inside the car park the symptom carriers were directed into one of five bays, and greeted by a worker in full protective equipment, holding up a mobile phone number to ring from inside the car. The person on the phone explained how to take the test, and then provided a kit.\n\u201cYou had to get a swab and rub it along the back of your throat and tonsils, and then use the same swab up your nose,\u201d said Charlie Dawkins, a pre-school worker who signed up for a test after coming down with a fever and sore chest. \u201cI\u2019m quite glad we got to do it ourselves, I feel that if someone else did it I would have been sick. We had to keep stopping.\u201d\nDawkins had driven for around half an hour with her mother, a key worker in a school who received an email saying she was eligible for tests the previous day. She too registered in the middle of the night.\nDawkins said she found the experience as smooth as testing for a terrifying disease could be ever be. \u201cThe people were really nice, everyone was so friendly.\u201d She has been told to expect results by text or email within 48 hours, linked to a QR code she was given on registration, and scanned when collecting the test kits.\nAcross the country key workers and their families and friends, some who had worried about their exposure and health for weeks, were going through this extraordinary, novel and anxiety-inducing procedure.\nNic Mitchell, a property and financial services adviser, began developing symptoms a few days ago, which forced her partner, the head engineer at a food processing factory, to go into isolation with her. She has a complex underlying medical condition. \u201cA test would help me manage my other underlying conditions better,\u201d she said. \u201cThe symptoms may be related to something else \u2013 this would help me rule it in or rule it out.\u201d Mitchell\u2019s partner is considered to be an essential worker, so they managed to book a test online.\nThe nearest centre for her was in Worcester, 22 miles from her home in Cheltenham. Before attending, she said it would be \u201cvery scary\u201d because she hadn\u2019t left the house since 4 January when she got back from holiday incredibly ill. \u201cActually, going into the outside world is something that gives me a high level of anxiety, so going 22 miles makes it worse,\u201d she added.\nWhen Mitchell arrived at the testing site at Worcester Warriors rugby club just before 3pm on Saturday, she was told that there would be a two and a half hour wait \u2013 but the centre would shut at 5pm regardless. The only option was to attempt to rebook. \u201cThey told me they couldn\u2019t cope,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was very disappointing.\u201d\nThe tents of the Milton Keynes test centre are visible from nearby roads, normally busy with shoppers and office workers, and now emptied by coronavirus. The silent streets, with the test queue the only sign of life, were a reminder of the abrupt distortion of normality.\nThe UK government has expanded the criteria for who qualifies for a free test for coronavirus to all essential workers and their families in England \u2013 up to 10 million people. The list of essential workers is the same as the one used to allow the children of key workers to carry on going to school during the lockdown:\nHealth and social careFrontline health and social care staff such as doctors, nurses, midwives, paramedics, as well as support and specialist staff in the health and social care sector. In addition it includes those working in supply chains including producers and distributors of medicines and personal protective equipment.\nEducation and childcareNursery, teaching staff and social workers.\nKey public servicesThose required to run the justice system, religious staff, as well as those responsible for managing the deceased, and journalists providing public service broadcasting.\nLocal and national governmentAdministrative occupations essential to the effective delivery of the Covid-19 response or delivering essential public services.\nFood and other necessary goodsThose involved in the production, processing, distribution, sale and delivery of food.\nPublic safety and national securityPolice, support staff, Ministry of Defence civilian staff and armed forces personnel, fire and rescue staff, and those responsible for border security, prisons and probation.\nTransportThose who will keep air, water, road and rail passenger and freight transport modes operating.\nUtilities, communication and financial servicesStaff required to keep oil, gas, electricity, water and sewerage operations running. Staff in the civil nuclear, chemical and telecommunications sectors. Those in postal services and those working to provide essential financial services.\nThe swabs are not tested on site, because they need sophisticated laboratory processing. Milton Keynes has one of the biggest labs in the country, based at the UK Biocentre, just a few miles from the car park test centre, which handles swabs sent from at least 20 testing centres across the country.\nThe labs are largely manned by scientists who volunteered to step away from their usual research to carry out testing, which is labour-intensive work.\nAt Milton Keynes, the scientists operate in pairs working 12-hour shifts, and together can handle around 400 to 500 swabs a day. The lab\u2019s daily capacity, at full stretch, is around 8,000 tests.\nInside the lab there are three work stations, the first of which is protected by a biosecurity hood, where samples are treated with a solution to kill everything inside. In the second, the virus\u2019s genetic material (or the material of anything picked up by the sample) is extracted. In the third, that genetic material is put through a machine that multiplies it, so that there is enough for the test to detect, then checked for coronavirus. The biggest challenge, experts say, is not the science but the logistics of getting the tests in, then scaling up and bringing in robots.\nThe Milton Keynes lab is part of a centralised approach to testing in the UK that has puzzled many scientists and may have been a key contributor to the slowincrease of testing capacity.\nOther countries that have rolled out more rapid testing programmes have relied at least in part on letting existing labs become testing centres with their own teams and equipment, who are able to start testing almost immediately on site.\nIn the UK, by contrast, authorities have chosen to bring equipment and scientists together in government-established centres, which are slower to get going because logistics and supply issues need to be worked out.\nProf Allyson Pollock, of Newcastle University, says one of the many reasons the UK\u2019s reaction has been late and, until now at least, fairly ineffective is that it can no longer respond to local need, because of endless reorganisations and years of austerity. She also says the government is treating this pandemic as a national one, when actually it is a series of local ones, requiring dedicated local responses.\nBut what angers scientists, health workers, experts and others more is why it was left until so recently \u2013 when Hancock was already admitting the peak was near \u2013 for this mass process of testing and contact tracing to be ordered across the country. And why has it all seemed so chaotic and poorly planned?\nThe criticism of ministers and their advisers is all the greater because they know the UK started on the right road only to halt, change course, then resume when the virus had spread and all that could be achieved was damage limitation.\nIn early March, during the \u201ccontainment phase\u201d, Public Health England (PHE) began testing and contact tracing of the few cases identified. Just under 300 staff were hired at that time. The team, working around the clock, traced 3,500 people and supported the 3% of contacts found to be infected to self-isolate. But tracing was then scaled back when the UK moved to the \u201cdelay phase\u201d.\nGovernments that have contained larger scale outbreaks once they are under way, perhaps most notably South Korea, which at one point was the worst affected country outside China, have done it through large-scale testing and rigorous tracing of the contacts of infected people.\n\u201cThe fact is that the UK was not able to operate a testing and tracing campaign like the one used in South Korea,\u2019 says Prof James Naismith, of Edinburgh University. \u201cWe, like many countries, did not have the infrastructure in place to maintain a testing programme in the first wave. South Korea - and Germany - did. However, as with being on the Titanic after it hit the iceberg, there is no time for recriminations, we need to act now to save lives. While we have lagged behind in testing and tracing, if we focus we can catch up.\u201d\nAfter the UK stopped its testing and contact tracing, the World Health Organization ordered all countries to \u201ctest, test, test\u201d. But in a vital period last month, the UK resisted. Only recently, as pressure to limit the lockdown has grown from businesses, Conservative MPs and a frustrated public, and as Hancock\u2019s testing target looked in danger, has the government completely changed course.\nThere is dismay among health workers who see daily the effects of Covid-19, that early efforts to \u201cramp up\u201d testing (before key workers were included from last Thursday) were suboptimal to say the least.\nSaffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said: \u201cThere has been a lot of zig-zagging and veering on what is the policy, who is responsible for mobilising it, what is the plan.\u201d When Hancock first announced his target of 100,000 tests a day she says no one really knew how it would work. \u201cIn our view it was not clear. It was just a number that was put out there.\u201d Cordery says it is not clear who the 100,000 should be initially, nor who would be involved in the testing. Should those to be tested include NHS staff, patients, who?\nThis lack of action was irksome for scientists, who last week pointed to the UK\u2019s massive but ignored capacity for carrying out genetic testing. Medical virology, molecular cancer and regional genetic laboratories as well as other academic centres around the country routinely use PCR [polymerase chain reaction] technology, which could easily have been turned to Covid-19 work a long time ago, they say.\n\u201cOnly the US has a greater capacity to do testing,\u201d said ProfGerome Breen, of King\u2019s College London. \u201cBut the NHS has refused to reply to many offers of help from research centres to supply tests.\u201d One of these offers came from Breen, a geneticist whose department already carries out PCR testing on a large scale. \u201cA month ago we offered to turn our laboratory over to Covid-19 work and test medical staff at King\u2019s College Hospital to find out who might have been infected with the virus. We could have started within a fortnight and would have been doing thousands of tests a day by now. We had a couple of emails from the department but heard nothing from them after that. It was intensely frustrating.\u201d\nProf Martin Marshall, the chairman of the Royal College of GPs, suggested GPs should have been able to play a bigger role in referring patients for testing and helping the testing process. This admittedly would have required them to have the correct PPE, which has proved another challenge altogether.\n\u201cHave they been a bit slow in getting to general practice, understanding the needs of general practice, understanding the PPE needs, for example, which took a time, understanding the role of general practice in identifying vulnerable patients understanding the testing needs for general practice? I think all of that has been slower than we would have liked to see.\u201d\nAsked if the government knew who it ought to be testing, he said: \u201cI think the testing programme has been influenced more by the politics of the availability of testing than it has by the epidemiology of what\u2019s required.\n\u201cYou can have a good policy on testing, but you can only deliver it if you\u2019ve actually got the kit.\u201d\nThis weekend, with the UK passing 20,000 hospital deaths from Covid-19 , and the WHO insisting that testing and contact tracing is essential before life can go back to normal, both are suddenly back at the heart of government policy.\nBut have the U-turns and the delays cost? And what if the lockdown has to continue for months more because effective testing and contact tracing has not been put in place?\nAlready business leaders and Conservative MPs are beginning to warn that without an easing of the lockdown based on testing and contact tracing, the economy faces ruin. Last week, the crisis facing small businesses and the need for a balance to be struck between saving lives and saving the economy was raised in a heated, virtual meeting of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers.\nThe former cabinet minister, David Davis, said: \u201cThere is deep concern among backbenchers about the fate of the vast numbers of small businesses, which will determine how fast we come out of this economic slump. Unless we are very quick and very effective at bringing as many as possible back into work in a few weeks\u2019 time, the scars of this problem will go on for a decade.\u201d\nGraham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee, said: \u201cAll members of parliament must be receiving representations from businesses large and small needing further assistance or some sense of when they can start to plan for at least a partial release from these measures.\u201d\nCharles Walker, the committee\u2019s vice-chair, added: \u201cOur inboxes are full of desperate people who own small businesses, some of which are their lives\u2019 work, who now risk losing everything. We need to have a cabinet minister put in charge of small business.\u201d\nThere is another, even more pressing need to start testing in increasing numbers, says Prof Charles Swanton, of the Francis Crick Institute in London, who is an oncologist and the chief clinician at Cancer Research UK. He said studies of infected hospital patients in Wuhan, in China, where Covid-19 first emerged, indicated that around 40% had contracted the disease inside the hospital. \u201cHospital transmission is a very likely source of ongoing Covid-19 infection in the middle of a lockdown,\u201d he said.\nFor some patients \u2013 for instance, those with life-threatening cancers \u2013 this is a very serious issue. \u201cPatients are avoiding going to their GPs and GPs are making fewer hospital referrals. There are also 200,000 fewer cancer screenings taking place each week in the UK, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. That, in turn, means there are approximately 2,000 to 2,500 cancer diagnoses being missed each week.\u201d\nMany scientists now believe reliable testing on a large scale really does offer the UK a route out of its Covid-19 crisis. However, merely reaching a figure of 100,000 tests a day on its own is not enough, warned Naismith.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t matter if we can test numbers of that order if we cannot then rapidly trace the contacts of those who are found to be positive and then isolate them. Once a person is found to be positive we will have to trace their contacts very, very quickly \u2013 within a day \u2013 and then test them.\u201d\nSuch tracing will inevitably require technological aids \u2013 mainly by using mobile phones to track a person\u2019s movements, said Naismith. \u201cInevitably, that will have privacy issues,\u201d he added. \u201cHowever, these will have to be dealt with because testing and tracing offers us the best chance we have for dealing with Covid-19 at the moment.\u201d\n This article was amended on 26 April 2020 to correct a quote from James Naismith.",

        "content": "More than 100 birds have been living wild in England as part of conservation scheme\nThe first wild stork chicks to hatch in Britain for centuries are expected to emerge next month after three pairs of the huge white birds built nests in West Sussex.\nDisdaining platforms constructed especially for them, the storks have created their stick nests in the heights of oak trees on the Knepp estate, the centre for a reintroduction project.\nWhite storks are traditionally thought to bring fertility and good luck but have been extinct as breeding birds in Britain since 1416, or possibly during the English civil war.\nMore than 100 birds have been bred in captivity and released at three locations in West Sussex and Surrey, including Knepp, a 3,500-acre former dairy farm that was rewilded at the turn of the century.\nKnepp is close to the West Sussex village of Storrington, known as Estorchestone or \u201chomestead of the white storks\u201d in the Domesday Book.\nStorks are monogamous and last year a young pair laid three eggs in a treetop nest at Knepp but the eggs did not hatch. This year, cameras were rigged up beside this old nest but the couple constructed a new nest instead, in which they have laid five eggs.\nWith four other birds having paired up and made nests, conservationists have high hopes that the first wild-born storks \u2013 which eat insects, earthworms and small mammals \u2013 will hatch and fledge this summer.\nLucy Groves, the white stork project officer for Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, one of the partners in the reintroduction scheme, said: \u201cThe female was just coming up to four years old last spring and was a little bit too young to breed but they obviously know what they are doing this year and were ahead of the game. It\u2019s really exciting. It\u2019s going to be a fantastic year.\u201d\nThe Greeks created the myth that storks deliver newborn babies and nesting pairs herald good luck in numerous European cultures. Reintroduction programmes have successfully returned storks to France, the Netherlands and Poland where wild populations build their towering stick nests in villages and towns.\nIsabella Tree, the co-owner of Knepp with Charlie Burrell, said: \u201cIt\u2019s so funny. We thought we needed to \u2018manage\u2019 them and put up nest platforms and so we did and they\u2019ve turned their beaks up at all of this \u2013 where they want to nest is in the tops of oaks. That\u2019s where they would\u2019ve nested when they were here centuries ago.\n\u201cI love the storks\u2019 association with rebirth and bringing new life. They are such a hopeful symbol for rewilding.\u201d\nWhite storks migrate south in the winter and some conservationists initially feared that captive-bred birds released in Britain would be unable to cross the Channel.\nBut 22 of the 24 birds bred in captivity by the Cotswold Wildlife Park and released into West Sussex last summer have migrated south to the Mediterranean and north Africa. Storks are faithful to where they are raised and these birds are expected to return to England when they are ready to breed.\nMore than 100 birds are now living wild and in fenced pens at Knepp and nearby sites in a reintroduction scheme masterminded by Burrell and Tree, who have seen wildlife roar back onto their rewilded farm.\nKnepp is now a hot spot for endangered species including nightingales, turtle doves and purple emperor butterflies. Beavers have been reintroduced in the fenced part of the farm, alongside free-roaming cattle and horses that mimic the grazing of extinct herbivores.\nSome of the storks are fenced in open-top pens to protect them from predators and ensure they bond with their \u201chome\u201d range. The birds can fly out when they are ready and also draw in passing wild birds. The male in Knepp\u2019s first pair is an un-ringed wild bird from continental Europe.\nThe chicks are expected to hatch in mid-May, and take 60 days to grow large enough to fly. The British-born wild storks are likely to fly south for three years or more before returning to England when they are ready to breed.\nThe project aims to have 30 wild pairs of storks by 2030 and can take heart from the successful return of another large white bird \u2013 the crane.\nBritain\u2019s crane population has reached its highest level for more than 400 years with 56 breeding pairs last summer. Natural recolonisation saw cranes return to east Norfolk in 1979 and reintroduction and conservation efforts led by the RSPB, the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust and Pensthorpe Conservation Trust have now returned them to the Somerset Levels, Wales, Scotland and the Humberhead Peatlands.",

        "content": "As 26 million Americans lose their jobs, the billionaire class has added $308bn to its wealth\nNever let a good crisis go to waste: as the coronavirus pandemic sweeps the world, America\u2019s 1% have taken profitable advantage of the old saying.\nSome of the richest people in the US have been at the front of the queue as the government has handed out trillions of dollars to prop up an economy it shuttered amid the coronavirus pandemic. At the same time, the billionaire class has added $308bn to its wealth in four weeks - even as a record 26 million people lost their jobs.\nAccording to a new report from the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive thinktank, between 18 March and 22 April the wealth of America\u2019s plutocrats grew 10.5%. After the last recession, it took over two years for total billionaire wealth to get back to the levels they enjoyed in 2007.\nEight of those billionaires have seen their net worth surge by over $1bn each, including the Amazon boss, Jeff Bezos, and his ex-wife MacKenzie Bezos; Eric Yuan, founder of Zoom; the former Microsoft chief Steve Ballmer; and Elon Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX technocrat.\nThe billionaire bonanza comes as a flotilla of big businesses, millionaires and billionaires sail through loopholes in a $349bn bailout meant to save hard-hit small businesses. About 150 public companies managed to bag more than $600m in forgivable loans before the funds ran out. Among them was Shake Shack, a company with 6,000 employees valued at $2bn. It has since given the cash back but others have not.\nFisher Island, a members-only location off the coast of Miami where the average income of residents is $2.2m and the beaches are made from imported Bahamian sand, has received $2m in aid.\nIts residents seemed to be doing fine even before the bailout. This month, the island purchased thousands of rapid Covid-19 blood test kits for all residents and workers. The rest of Florida is struggling. About 1% of Florida\u2019s population has been tested for the coronavirus, behind the national figure of 4%. The state is also in the midst of an unemployment claims crisis, with its underfunded benefits system unable to cope with the volume of people filing.\nThe banks that were the largest recipients of bailout cash in the last recession have also done well, raking in $10bn in fees from the government loans, according to an analysis by National Public Radio.\n\u201cHeads we win, tails you lose,\u201d said Chuck Collins, director of the program on inequality and the common good at the Institute for Policy Studies and co-author of the new report.\nCollins said the pandemic had further exposed fault lines in the US body politic that have been widening the gap between the really rich and the rest over decades.\n\u201cThe rules of the economy have been tipped in favor of asset owners against everyone else,\u201d said Collins.\nBy 2016 \u2013 seven years after the end of the last recession \u2013 the bottom 90% of households in the US had still not recovered from the last downturn while the top 10% had more wealth than they had in 2007.\nThroughout the recovery, stock market gains disproportionately favored the wealthy. The top 1% of households own nearly 38% of all stock, according to research by the New York University economist Edward Wolff. Even before the coronavirus hit, homeownership in the US \u2013 a traditional source of wealth growth \u2013 was well below its 2004 peak.\nNor did Americans earn more. Wage growth remained sluggish during the decade-long record-breaking growth in the jobs market that came after the last recession.\nFor black and Latinx Americans, the situation is worse. The black-white wage gaps are larger today than they were in 1979.\nMeanwhile, billionaires have been unable to put a well-heeled foot wrong. Billionaire wealth soared 1,130% in 2020 dollars between 1990 and 2020, according to the Institute for Policy Studies. That increase is more than 200 times greater than the 5.37% growth of median wealth in the US over this same period. And the tax obligations of America\u2019s billionaires, measured as a percentage of their wealth, decreased 79% between 1980 and 2018.\nSo when the pandemic struck, those at the apex of the wealth pyramid were better positioned than ever to take advantage of the chaos. The rest, not so much.\nCollins has been studying income inequality for 25 years and has seen the really rich win victory after victory. But even he was surprised by how quickly America\u2019s billionaires have turned pandemic into profit. \u201cI still get shocked,\u201d he said.",

He also flagged it as a necessary step to relaxing restrictions.\nThe app will store 21 days of data of people you have come into contact with, and the data will be held on your phone in that time.\nIt is only uploaded to a government server, housed in Australia and run by Amazon, in the event that you test positive for coronavirus, and then consent for your log to be uploaded to the server.\nHealth officials in each state and territory will then be able to access the list of contacts to then call those people and inform them they need to isolate and get tested.\nHealth minister Greg Hunt has published a determination that prevents the data being used for other purposes, including for law enforcement purposes or court orders, and the data must be held within Australia. He said legislation would be introduced in parliament in May to back this determination up.\nAlong with the app\u2019s release, the government has published a privacy impact assessment, and has said the source code will be released subject to Australian Signals Directorate giving it the go ahead.\nThe Law Council of Australia president, Pauline Wright, has previously urged the government to sign up to a series of \u201ccore design principles\u201d for the app, to ensure privacy would be safeguarded.\nShe said in a statement: \u201cThe series of core principles include clear governing laws and administrative frameworks, adoption of a voluntary \u2018opt-in\u2019 model, limitations on the collection of users\u2019 personal information, a prohibition on any secondary use or disclosure of information collected by the app, security of personal information, and limited use of de-identified information for specified public health purposes, amongst others.\u201d\nHome affairs minister Peter Dutton, who has recently recovered from the coronavirus after contracting it during a visit to the United States, also flagged stronger biosecurity measures at Australian airports, once international travel is permitted to resume.\nHis department came under scrutiny for how it handled airport arrivals once Australia had declared a pandemic, before the borders were closed to international travellers.\nWhile not addressing those concerns, Dutton said home affairs would examine additional biosecurity measures it could put in place to check the health of arriving passengers, once travel restrictions were lifted.\n\u201cIn this downtime, we can look at some of the emerging technologies [in how we can assess] if people are healthy or not,\u201d he said, while admitting there were \u201cmassive limitations\u201d.\nAustralia\u2019s border closure was put in place for at least six months while the world waits for a vaccine for the coronavirus, but the prime minister has said he would like Australia to \u201creconnect\u201d with New Zealand as soon as possible.\nNew Zealand has embarked on an ambitious eradication regime, with stricter lockdowns in place in an attempt to eliminate Covid-19 from the country completely.\nAustralia\u2019s suppression strategy has succeeded to the point where eradication of the virus is being touted as a potential outcome, with both countries optimistic, but hesitant, to re-start trans-Tasman travel any time soon.",

I\u2019d work from home in the mornings and swim in icy lakes in the afternoons. Instead, I occupied the shadow side of mountain culture, one not portrayed in tourism brochures. What came next was internet addiction, isolation, social anxiety and insomnia, much of it fuelled by my crippling fear of bears.\nThe one place where I felt safe to walk by myself was a small clearing in the woods on the edge of town. There were long sightlines between the conifers, so I could watch for approaching animals. Still, walking the same 500-metre route between a train track and a small cluster of hotels soon gets old. To mix things up \u2013 and because a glamorous early aviator named Beryl Markham used to do it \u2013 I began going barefoot.\nOf course, I felt like an idiot doing this. But I was far from bored. Not now I had to pay attention to rocks and roots. Now I could recognise the small joy of finding a dandelion stalk caught between the toes. It\u2019s true I was missing out on epic things: on mountain climbs and swims. But as spring turned to summer, here were trees seeding clouds, a twig like a chicken foot, and birds singing \u201cchubby cheeks\u201d and \u201ccheeseburger\u201d as they flew away, startled. Here was more than enough.\nMy fear of bear attacks has now faded, but I\u2019ve continued with these barefoot walks, because now I think the joy of gripping rock and feeling sensation exists not just for skilled climbers picking their way through ice to a snowy summit. A softer version can occur while walking under a cleared line of pylons, on a short and familiar walk without needing to hit our body\u2019s maximum rate of oxygen use during exercise, or VO2 max.\nIf you read the hippie articles online, you\u2019ll read that going barefoot is called \u201cearthing\u201d or \u201cgrounding.\u201d You\u2019ll read that negative ions from the Earth\u2019s surface spill into a person\u2019s feet as they come into contact with the ground\u2019s electrical charge. These ions, apparently, can charge a person up like a depleted iPad. They can make a person feel happier, calmer, less anxious.\nMaybe this is true. But maybe scrambling at ground level, touching rocks and roots, just feels good. And we need all the help we can get to feel good right now.\nAilsa Ross is the author of the illustrated children\u2019s book The Woman Who Rode a Shark: And 50 More Wild Female Adventurers",

        "content": "17 Arm, advised by Malcolm Rifkind, Ken Macdonald and others, is financing claim by Alexander Tugushev\nA firm advised by a former Conservative foreign secretary and a former chief prosecutor is funding a large-scale legal action in the English courts by a convicted Russian fraudster once banned from Britain.\nThe firm, 17 Arm, which is advised by Malcolm Rifkind, Ken Macdonald and other establishment figures, is financing the legal claim by Alexander Tugushev against a Russian billionaire in an expensive and lengthy court battle.\nTugushev was jailed for six years for fraud in Russia in 2007 after he was convicted of receiving an illicit payment while holding a government post. He disputes the conviction.\nIn the legal action in London, he alleges that his former business partner has cheated him out of his share of a substantial fishing empire. He is suing to recover the share, which he values at $350m. 17 Arm would be paid a slice of that sum \u2013 running to millions of pounds \u2013 if he wins.\nThe case throws a spotlight on a relatively novel and risky area of legal practice known as litigation funding. In such actions, a commercial firm backed by private investors pays the upfront cost of barristers and solicitors to fight a case for an individual who has a legal claim. If the individual wins, the commercial firm is rewarded with a cut of money won in court. If the individual loses, the firm gets nothing.\nThis winner-takes-all approach is funding a significant number of lawsuits in Britain. But critics such as the former justice minister Lord Faulks say it can mean that, for example, litigation is started to make a profit rather than to redress grievances.\nIn a statement, 17 Arm said: \u201cLitigation funding is a common mechanism which empowers aggrieved people, who couldn\u2019t otherwise afford to bring litigation, to fight their cases and win justice.\u201d\nLord Clanwilliam, 17 Arm\u2019s chairman, declined to respond when asked how much it would win if Tugushev were victorious in his legal claim. \u201cWe pride ourselves on discretion and do not discuss the specifics of our work,\u201d he said.\nThe Eton-educated businessman described 17 Arm, which was set up three years ago, as being involved in litigation finance management as well as recovering and returning assets to their owners through investigative and legal means. It is based in Dubai and Jersey.\nIts advisory board consists of Rifkind, a former foreign and defence secretary, Lord Macdonald, who was the director of public prosecutions between 2003 and 2008, Pauline Neville-Jones, a former security minister and chair of the joint intelligence committee, and another peer, Lord St John of Bletso.\nThe board gives advice on potential legal claims to see if, for example, they have a reasonable claim of winning.\nAsked if the advisory board was giving credibility to a legal claim advanced by a convicted fraudster, the firm and its advisers said: \u201cWe believe in the right of every individual to have their case heard in a court of law.\u201d\nThe firm added: \u201cA disputed conviction in a jurisdiction notorious for corrupt and unfair trials is no bar to bringing an arguable and admissible case in London, where a just outcome can be expected. The English high court agreed that this case was properly brought here \u2013 and its ruling was so patently correct that the court of appeal has refused the defendants\u2019 permission to appeal against it.\u201d\nThe dispute, initiated by Tugushev in London\u2019s civil courts two years ago, has yet to reach a full trial, although there have been preliminary hearings and other skirmishes.\nA judge at one hearing described it as a \u201cbitter battle\u201d between two Russians that had generated a \u201cdepressingly vast amount\u201d of legal paperwork. More than \u00a35m has already been spent on teams of barristers and solicitors for both sides.\nThe legal fight is centred on Norebo Group, an international fishing business worth an estimated $1.5bn (\u00a31.2bn). Based in Russia, it catches 400,000 tons of fish a year and sells to customers including Birds Eye, McDonald\u2019s and Tesco.\nTugushev claims two former partners have dishonestly conspired to deny that he owns a third of the firm he helped set up in 1998.\nTugushev has told the English court that he was jailed after he and others were accused of receiving $3m for awarding a fishing quota while he was deputy chairman of an official Russian committee. He said the allegation was politically motivated and untrue.\nHe said that in 2013 he applied to travel to England to attend meetings at Norebo\u2019s office in Maidenhead, Berkshire, but was refused \u201con the ground of my conviction\u201d. 17 Arm said he held a UK visa and currently lived in London.\nVitaly Orlov, the Russian billionaire, and two other businessmen deny his claims, alleging that Tugushev is resorting to extortion.",

        "content": "From a California stylist to an Oregon bookshop, west coast business owners say government assistance has been little help\nLeAna McKnight survived Hurricane Katrina, and now she\u2019s fighting for her business to survive Covid-19.\n\u201cOnce you\u2019ve lost everything, including your home, nothing stresses you out too much,\u201d said McKnight.\nLike millions of small businesses across the US, McKnight\u2019s Stylist Lee Hair Studio in West Hollywood, California, had to close indefinitely in mid-March because of stay-at-home orders aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus.\nAnd like fellow entrepreneurs around the country, she is struggling to figure out how her salon will rebound from the crisis whenever she is able to reopen.\nThe Small Business Administration loan programs established under the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act were meant to provide a lifeline for businesses like McKnight\u2019s. But the effort has been overwhelmed by the needs. The $350bn set aside for SBA Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans was exhausted before many small businesses were even able to get overwhelmed bank systems to accept their applications. And at least some of the loans went to businesses most would not consider \u201csmall\u201d, including the restaurant chains Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House, Potbelly Sandwiches and Shake Shack; multimillion-dollar publicly traded biotech companies; coal producers and hedge funds.\nWhile elected officials and policymakers look to add as much as $500bn for additional loans, some small business owners say the program isn\u2019t just underfunded but fatally flawed. The PPP is only forgiven if at least 75% of the money is used to cover payroll costs \u2013 leaving little for business supplies, rent, or utilities. What was first announced as a forgivable $10,000 advance on an SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) was changed days later to $1,000 per employee a business previously had on staff.\nSmall businesses on the west coast appear to have had a particularly hard time securing aid. According to two analyses of how SBA funds were allocated, California, Oregon and Washington received some of the smallest shares of aid compared with the eligible payroll in each state.\nEach of the country\u2019s over 30 million small businesses has unique needs and challenges in the face of a common disaster. Five owners on the west coast told the Guardian how they\u2019re working to stay afloat.\nTo McKnight, government aid has so far proved elusive: \u201cI\u2019m living off my savings,\u201d she said.\nMcKnight\u2019s small studio, which specializes in natural hair and extensions, opened in 2014 and is largely a one-woman operation. She works with a remote assistant and an agency that helps book her clients, but she has been forced to pause those relationships.\nIn normal times, her total costs per month, including rent, are roughly $7,000, and she typically makes between $3,000 and $4,000 a week. Her online leather business is on hold due to manufacturing shutdowns. That means her only continuing source of income is her online hair products store. She\u2019s on track to lose roughly $5,000 a month.\nMcKnight applied to the PPP loan and the EIDL advance but hasn\u2019t yet had luck. She also applied for unemployment but has not been approved, and she hasn\u2019t yet received her stimulus check. Even if the loans came through, she would suffer thousands of dollars of losses each month the lockdown continues.\nFor now, McKnight is staying optimistic, noting that her clients are desperate to get back into the salon. \u201cI promised myself I would not lose everything again,\u201d she said.\n\u2013 SC & SL\nGuerrilla Tacos, too, overcame huge obstacles to open in 2018. Chef Wes Avila started Guerrilla as an unauthorized Los Angeles food cart that was repeatedly shut down by police. After officers threatened to confiscate his supplies, he turned the business into a truck, eventually transitioning to a bricks-and-mortar location.\nIt was a \u201cmiracle\u201d that Guerrilla had thrived even this long, said Brittney Valles, managing partner who opened the restaurant with Avila. Valles fundraised for the taco joint when she was only 23 years old, and she is the first in her family to graduate college. \u201cPeople took a chance on me.\u201d\nThe shutdowns have sent the owners scrambling: \u201cWe don\u2019t operate with hundreds of thousands in our bank account. We don\u2019t have this crazy backing of capital and tech to maintain a business in a pandemic.\u201d\nValles previously employed 58 people. Now, doing take-out and delivery only, the restaurant is down to seven employees (plus her boyfriend, who is working for free). She furloughed the rest of staff.\nGuerrilla\u2019s rent is $25,000 a month. In February, pre-Covid, the restaurant made $400,000 in sales. That dipped to $150,000 in March, and she estimated April would bring in $60,000 or less. She successfully secured the disaster loan and was told she was approved for PPP, though that money hasn\u2019t arrived yet.\nUltimately, with an eviction moratorium in place, she held off paying rent to instead cover healthcare for her furloughed workers. While she may be in a better position than other taquerias, the long-term future is uncertain, especially if she has to operate with reduced tables or other restrictions.\nShe did not plan for a pandemic when she negotiated rent, she said, and fears her landlord would quickly replace her with a more financially stable chain if she continues to be short.\n\u201cIt feels like my entire dream and all the people who work for me and alongside me are all just getting fucked. It\u2019s so exhausting,\u201d she said.\nFor now, Guerrilla is offering \u201cemergency taco kits\u201d to go, which provide customers with ingredients to make their own tacos at home. One of the chefs is also offering a specialty dinner each week. First up was a nod to Ruth\u2019s Chris, the American steakhouse corporation that received $20m in loans, and a lot of backlash.\n\u2013 SL\nWhen a car careened into the front of her tiny Oakland, California, bakery in early 2019, Jen Angel thought she\u2019d been through the worst of it as a small business owner. Angel established the business with a catering and events service and opened the first storefront in the spring of 2016. Almost exactly four years later, the parties, corporate events, weddings and other advance orders that make up the majority of her income dried up in mid-March. Sales dropped from an average of $18,000 a month to about $4,500 at the start of what is usually the busiest season for Angel Cakes.\n\u201cAside from Valentine\u2019s Day, January and February are really slow, so we work hard in the spring and summer to make sure we have enough cash flow in the winter,\u201d said Angel.\nAngel spoke while prepping in her small kitchen for the weekly orders that are still keeping the business afloat, clearing nearly all monthly rent, insurance and utility costs. It\u2019s work she does entirely on her own now, having been forced to lay off five part-time employees not only because she couldn\u2019t pay them, but because there\u2019s no room for more than one person to work in the Angel Cakes kitchen at a time and stay at a safe distance from anyone else. Those workers are now receiving unemployment benefits, but Angel is drawing no personal income.\n\u201cI have basically applied for every loan and every grant,\u201d said Angel, from the US Chamber of Commerce (full) to a Facebook small business aid program (no response yet) to a City of Oakland grant for low-income business owners (rejected). \u201cThey said they had $5,000 to give to 90 businesses, and they received 1,200 applications. Every program is overwhelmed.\u201d\nAngel did receive a $5,000 forgivable advance from the EIDL emergency grant, $1,000 for each employee \u2013 \u201cThe way I found out I got it was it just appeared in my bank account. There was no email, no letter, nothing.\u201d But she hesitated to apply for the larger PPP loan.\n\u201cWhat if the shelter in place order goes past 30 June ? What if some of my employees have different jobs? They might have moved, they might not be available. What if I can\u2019t get back up to my previous payroll? As somebody who has no cushion, the idea of taking on debt with the chance it\u2019s going to be forgiven, but might not, is just not an option,\u201d said Angel.\nA $15,000 zero-interest loan from the not-for-profit Kiva will help cover what costs she can\u2019t make in her weekly orders, but it\u2019s still debt she\u2019ll have to pay back once the business is truly up and running again \u2013 a timeline that remains vague at best.\n\u201cAs a small-business person, I always think: this is the year I\u2019m going to get ahead and have some savings,\u201d Angel said. \u201cAfter having built the business for 10 years, it\u2019s just such a disappointment that it\u2019s still a struggle even though I\u2019m doing everything else right.\u201d\n\u2013 SC\nStacey Sampson started teaching body-positive yoga classes at a local community center in Spokane, Washington, a few years ago. The response was so enthusiastic, she said, she was soon looking for a space of her own.\nSampson, 38, rented and renovated a studio and brought on two other yoga instructors to help her teach daily classes. Before coronavirus shut the studio last month, it had grown to about 100 members: not the biggest yoga studio in town, but one that offered \u201ca niche that was not being met\u201d.\nSince the shutdown, Sampson has continued paying her instructors to offer members or drop-in customers the same classes, now livestreamed. But attendance has dropped. \u201cPeople have had to cancel memberships,\u201d Sampson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a luxury they can\u2019t afford right now.\u201d\nShifting a yoga studio online \u201cis a model that works in theory\u201d, she said, but so far, the math isn\u2019t adding up. The rent for her studio is still $1,100 a month, plus another $250 in utilities. Drop-in classes online are still $15 each. A year-long membership is $600.\nSampson has applied for emergency assistance, including a normal Small Business Administration loan, and the EIDL emergency grant, which promised up to $10,000.\n\u201cThe application said that we would have funding within three days, and that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Sampson said. A week later, she heard there had been problems with the system and that she should apply again, so she did. Once again, nothing. \u201cI still haven\u2019t seen a dime.\u201d\nBecause she runs a very small business, and one that works with independent contractors, not employees on payroll, the government relief programs aren\u2019t really designed for her, Sampson said. She\u2019s still waiting to see if she will get individual pandemic unemployment support from Washington state.\n\u201cEvery road I\u2019ve gone down has hit a dead end,\u201d she said.\nSampson has been told her landlord is willing to work with businesses to find a way through the crisis, but she is still waiting to hear more. Some of the studio\u2019s supporters have stepped up with PayPal donations or early membership renewals, \u201cwhich is amazing, but so far it\u2019s not been enough\u201d.\nBeing a relatively new business is particularly challenging. \u201cIf you\u2019re a more well-known business in the community, you\u2019re more likely to get the help you need,\u201d she said.\nAnd even if the shutdown ends soon, Sampson said, she will still face uncertainty: should she reopen the studio and risk the chance that an instructor or a customer might spread the infection? Will people still want to sweat together in a crowded room, even once legal restrictions are lifted?\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know when people are going to feel safe to be in my type of space,\u201d she said.\n\u2013 LB\nSince it was founded in 1981, Jan\u2019s Paperbacks has always been owned by women. Its romance novel section is 20ft long.\nIts owner, Lori Carroll, bought the bookstore in 2018 from a friend who had been struggling to find another buyer. \u201cI just wanted to keep the store open,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cI want independent bookstores to survive.\u201d\nEven before the pandemic, Carroll had been running the store, in Beaverton, Oregon, as a one-woman operation. In normal times, her sales barely covered her costs: $3,000 a month in rent and another $3,000 a month in other expenses, including paying off the loans she took out to buy the business and move it to a new location. She has done other work on the side, including editing and dog-walking, to support herself.\nDuring coronavirus shutdowns, Carroll has actually seen the bookstore\u2019s sales go up, as she has shifted her business model to offer curbside pickups, books by mail, and very socially distanced browsing, with only one customer allowed inside the store at a time. (Anything a customer touches but does not buy must be put on a special table, to be disinfected later.)\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten a ton of new customers,\u201d she said. \u201cThey walk in and they just say: you need to stay open.\u201d She\u2019s been given a $20 tip on one order, a $60 tip on another. \u201cSomebody mailed me a check for $100.\u201d\nCarroll is now working seven days a week. With the growing sales, her expenses, too, have shot through the roof since many customers are now ordering new books, which Carroll has to pay to order herself, rather than the used books that are already in her inventory.\n\u201cFor March, I was able to pay my rent [on time] but not my utilities,\u201d Carroll said. Her landlord has offered her some flexibility, she said, but he also has bills to pay.\nCarroll said she received an EIDL emergency grant from the federal government in her bank account a few days ago, but it hasn\u2019t helped much. After she applied for the grant on 31 March, she said, she was told the emergency fund would only offer $1,000 per employee. That meant, for her, exactly $1,000.\n\u201cI find it humorous,\u201d she said. \u201cYou said it was going to be $10,000 in three days, and it became $1,000 after three weeks.\u201d\nShe was told she had been approved for a normal SBA business loan of $25,000, but she is still waiting on paperwork to complete the loan.\nWhile access to government assistance has been frustrating, she said, small businesses in downtown Beaverton have stepped up to help each other. From her bookstore, she is selling cookies for a local bakery and skincare products for a boutique.\nOn the day the federal government announced it had run out of emergency funding to help small businesses and was not accepting any more applications, Carroll tried to offer some consolation to her banker across the street. \u201cI was like, here\u2019s some cupcakes, enjoy,\u201d she said.\n\u2013 LB",

        "content": "Using the Fifa archive we rewatch a series of memorable games in search of answers we didn\u2019t find at the time\nIn his brilliant, dashed-off book U and I the novelist Nicholson Baker invented something called closed book examination. This involves taking a much-cherished object \u2013 in his case the books of John Updike \u2013 and writing down everything you can remember about it without ever looking at the original.\nThe idea is to contrast the internalised version with the cold hard text. Often Baker\u2019s preciously guarded version of Updike tallies up with the real thing. Often it doesn\u2019t. Lines, phrases, details take on a life of their own, distended by time and distance.\nThis is also the way we tend to recall big sporting events. A lot of the stuff we know as fact turns out to be closed book fiction, a version of the truth steeped in the memory and settled now as a matter of certainty. Talking of which: England versus Argentina, 1986. What actually happened there?\nThe closed book history of that World Cup quarter-final, an event most people will have watched once, 34 years ago, states that the game was pretty much even. Diego Maradona punched the ball into the net. He scored a wonder-goal from nowhere. Towards the end something freakish happened to stop Gary Lineker heading an equaliser.\nJimmy Hill, co-commentating for the BBC in Mexico, announced that Bobby Robson\u2019s team had been \u201cknocked out of the World Cup by an act of blatant cheating\u201d. England were unlucky, derailed by a muscular man in shiny shorts with a Malvinas grudge and a streak of ragged genius.\nThis version also elides with a broader picture of Argentina\u2019s World Cup win as basically a one-man affair. The players lived in wooden huts in Mexico. They shaved outside, cooked barbecues, horsed around on the bus to the games. How did we lose to this lot? How did we lose a clear chance to actually win the World Cup?\nAt which point: rewind. The Fifa archive film comes in vivid, slightly grainy square-screen. The pictures capture a world that was still pre-modern: cotton shirts, adverts for Camel cigarettes, skinny men in Union Jack shorts frazzling in the midday sun. The players\u2019 heads flash up on screen and you remember how young and handsome Maradona was in those pre-meltdown days. England are in white shirts and light blue shorts.\nThe names of the starting XI are: Pete, Gary, Kenny, Terry, Terry, Trevor, Glenn, Pete, Steve, Pete, Gary. Little wonder that in this company being called \u201cGlenn\u201d could mark you out as a bit of a maverick.\nEngland\u2019s pre-tournament first-choice midfield, Bryan and Ray, is absent for this game, one as a result of injury and the other not being recalled after suspension. At which point it is worth dwelling on the mood, the vibe, the outlook. The Madness Of England Football Part 1.\nIn the buildup to Mexico 86 Bryan Robson had written an article in which he revealed that he felt tortured by the famous picture of Bobby Moore lifting the World Cup. When he saw it he wanted to rip it up. This was because England had gone a full 20 years \u2013 imagine! \u2013 without winning the World Cup again. Never mind the fact England had managed to qualify only twice since then. Robson was tortured by the failure to actually win it, something that could still be cast as a transgression against the natural order.\nBut then, four years previously the England World Cup squad had sung \u201cthis time, more than any other time\u201d, a tournament song ode to yearning and missed chances that ignores the fact England had actually won the World Cup just 16 years previously. There had only been 11 World Cups at that stage. England had no right being this upset, this thwarted. This Time is proof of only one thing: that England as a nation is hardwired to see nostalgia and lost sovereignty on every available stage.\nEngland football has always been to some degree about scale and loss of scale. Being cheated, not just out of a goal, but out of everything; well this was always going to be an irresistible twist.\nBack in Mexico, the referee, Ali Bin Nasser, appears on screen, an ambling figure with a range of oddly formal gestures. He\u2019s described by the Fifa commentator as the \u201crelatively inexperienced Tunisian\u201d.\nThe game kicks off and England pass the ball around slowly at the back. Steve Hodge is kicked to the ground. Kenny Sansom launches a startlingly long, flat throw. And almost immediately everyone looks fried in the midday heat, the players barely moving off the ball. This is the biggest textural difference. Nobody stands still these days.\nOnly Peter Reid is really running around. He dispossesses Maradona, loses his boot and keeps on running. For 15 minutes he\u2019s the best player on the pitch. His opposite number is Sergio Batista, who despite being only 23 has perfected the classic bearded serial killer midfielder look. The crowd noise is an ambient hum through this, with sudden vague hisses of excitement.\nEngland\u2019s full-backs stay very wide. The whole team is arranged in a series of rigid squares. Argentina are more fluid, easier in possession, and more prone to breaking up those tight lines. It takes Maradona 10 minutes to drop deep and play his first high-speed one-two. He beats Sansom twice and is violently hacked down by Terry Fenwick, just back from suspension, and rewarded with his fourth yellow card of the tournament. The free-kick deflects off Glenn Hoddle\u2019s head and Peter Shilton palms it awkwardly over the bar, barely getting off the ground. He looks very small in that moment.\nDoes anyone else think Shilton gets away with it a bit? There was a real sense of English goalkeeping exceptionalism in the 1980s. Our keepers were scowling, nerveless, un-clown-like. They were the Best In The World. But Shilton should probably have caught that ball back from Hodge, the one that hasn\u2019t happened yet. Aged 40, he didn\u2019t get off the ground against West Germany in 1990, or get anywhere near any of those penalties.\nMaradona pops up on the left and whips in a lovely cross. Thirty minutes gone and we haven\u2019t had a shot. Gary Lineker gets his first touch and is hacked down by Oscar Ruggeri. Jorge Valdano holds the ball well, striding from wing to wing, much more than just a target man. And by now England are under pressure. They can\u2019t really keep the ball. The players are relentlessly committed and forceful in the challenge. But they also kick the ball like they hate it. In possession they run through the same drilled patterns.\nDoes it have to be like this? The Madness of England Football Part 2: for decades the national team played this way as a matter of choice. There is a notion that England looked like a regressive footballing force because they had no plan. But this isn\u2019t true. They did have a plan. They had a bad plan.\nCharles Hughes was the FA\u2019s de facto technical director in 1986. The plan was clear, developed out of the garden-shed direct football data of Wing Commander Charles Reep. This Reep-Hughes ideology stated that direct forward passes were the way to win at football, that set pieces and crosses into the Position of Maximum Opportunity were the dictum, and that players who were willing to deliver this would be selected. It seems odd now that so many influences \u2013 the progressiveness of Bobby Robson, the grace of Hoddle \u2013 could be subsumed by this. But Hoddle was always chafing against the orthodoxy, and England doomed to battle against the limits of their own vision.\nAs half-time approaches Maradona goes to take a corner, removes the flag, and has to literally tie the material back on to the pole himself before the game can continue. The interval arrives as a bit of a relief to everyone. We\u2019ve yet to see a shot on target. But there is a feeling of ascent, of one team playing with the flow.\nThe commentator reminds us England have conceded once in six and a half games. In fact they\u2019ve kept 17 clean sheets in their last 26 games. All of which helps to explain the startling nature of what happens six minutes into the second half.\nMaradona takes the ball deep on the left side and beats three men with five touches. He veers past Hoddle with ease. Reid and Fenwick just can\u2019t get there. The ball is chipped towards Valdano. At which point Hodge does something odd, skying the ball back on the volley towards his keeper. Shilton is surprised. Maradona is standing in what would have been an offside position. He runs forward and punches the ball into the goal.\nSo many questions. Why didn\u2019t Shilton just clean him out? Why didn\u2019t he take the ball with both hands? Why didn\u2019t the referee or assistant referee see it? In his autobiography Maradona says he was running to the far side screaming for everyone to follow before the referee disallowed it.\nEngland are winded by this. Argentina have been the better team, but there\u2019s no doubt the gut-wrench of the first goal has something to do with the brilliance of the second. Suddenly there is space, a relax of air. It takes a genius to do this with it.\nLet us ponder Maradona for a moment. He is already playing a different kind of game to anyone else in this tournament. Football was a brutal environment. People didn\u2019t dribble and hurdle challenges or try to break the whole game open on their own.\nMaradona has talked about how he found the right tempo in Italy. He knew if he played at full speed nobody could live with him. But he knew he couldn\u2019t do it all the time, partly because of exhaustion, partly because he\u2019d be kicked to death. How much of this can I cope with, how far can I extend myself? In Mexico he found the perfect timing, the perfect set of rhythms.\nWith 55 minutes gone Maradona takes the ball facing his own goal in his own half to the right of the centre circle. Eleven seconds later it\u2019s in the England net. First he pirouettes away from Peter Beardsley, then he dodges Reid. Reid runs back with him, losing ground. Terry Butcher has charged out to fill the space. Maradona hurdles him. He\u2019s at the edge of the area now. Something is clarifying. He veers past Fenwick, who puts an arm across his throat.\nHe takes a soft, rolled touch with his left foot that puts Shilton off balance. Butcher has got back, but Maradona shifts his feet to block the lunge from behind, then prods the ball into the empty net as the world starts to erupt around him. Argentina\u2019s No 10 has beaten seven challenges and run straight through the middle of all that English muscle, a man playing with a kind of light around him.\nTo their credit England rally. Beardsley begins to affect the game. Batista is finally booked. Reid is replaced by a pre-mullet Chris Waddle, hair forming a wondrous pomp-rock tangle down his shoulders. Hoddle has a shot. Waddle produces a fine dipping cross with the outside of his boot.\nArgentina\u2019s players are shouting at each other. And England are finally bringing their version of the game to bear, putting the ball into the box, creating some aerial confusion. At which point, enter John Barnes, who comes on for Trevor Steven.\nThis is not the full Barnes, not yet the player who would illuminate the First Division with Liverpool. But it is also his first appearance of the tournament. Lads, he\u2019s your most talented player. There you go, Barnesey, have 15 minutes. And by the way we\u2019re 2-0 down.\nSome shithousery has broken out by now. England players are grabbing their opponents and hoisting them to their feet. There are sneaky kicks and trips. Hoddle is furious as Maradona punts the ball away as he stands over a free-kick.\nBarnes gets his first touch on 79 minutes. A minute later he gets his first pass of the World Cup. He ducks outside, beats his man, gets to the line and crosses. Throughout all this Lineker has kept on making his finely judged runs, playing with wonderful patience. He\u2019s in the perfect spot to head it in, a goal that captures a different kind of brilliance.\nArgentina go back down the other end of the pitch and hit the inside of the post. Maradona takes the ball and waggles his foot over it by the corner flag, waiting for someone to kick him. There are seven minutes to go.\nSoon after we get the final significant act. Barnes gets his second pass of the tournament. This is how England might have played. Hodge wins the ball from Maradona. Hoddle plays an instant pass. Barnes goes for the line, beats two men and puts a cross to the back post.\nA while back I asked about what happens next on Twitter. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Lineker just punch the ball into the net, he knew he wasn\u2019t going to reach it?\u201d At which point something very modern happened. \u201cHe did reach it,\u201d a voice interjected, like some unanswerable deus ex machina.\nThe Voice of Football? Jehovah himself? In fact it was Lineker himself, lurking once again in just the right spot. He is of course right. The cross produces an astonishing piece of defending from Julio Olarticoechea, who somehow gets around Lineker just as he makes contact and deflects the ball away. This is what denied England in that moment: not bad luck, but brilliance.\nLineker is hurt, dumped into the back of the net. In the stands lads are singing and waving their union flags. Argentina have started to triple-mark Barnes, blue shirts in full panic-defence mode. Imagine if he\u2019d been on for an hour. The final whistle is blown and Argentina\u2019s players bounce around, rejoicing in a moment that isn\u2019t just to do with football.\nWatching the game back has clarified some things. It\u2019s obvious why England didn\u2019t win the World Cup. They weren\u2019t good enough. Or rather, they were good for 10 minutes and so-so for 80. Argentina may have had a (cheating) genius at the height of his powers. But they also looked a lot more like a modern football team.\nWhereas England still couldn\u2019t help themselves. The Madness of English Football Part 3. Bobby Robson took a better team to Italy in 1990. He shifted the formation to suit his players. He trusted his instincts, playing Waddle, Barnes, Lineker, Beardsley and Paul Gascoigne in the same XI. England really were a bit unlucky in Turin. They might have had their revenge for the Azteca at the final in Rome. And yet within two years they would be back at Euro 92, managed by an arch-zealot of direct football in Graham Taylor, and producing something that looked almost like a pastiche of that cod-science long-ball island game.\nEngland were cheated in Mexico. But nobody was robbed. Destiny wasn\u2019t altered. Something was still being worked through here. And while the dynamic may have changed now, with the arrival of a global top-tier league and the systems-football of the Southgate era, it is also possible to miss that note of variation; the days when England, who thought they were the state of the art, the once and future kings, were still playing a different game altogether.",

        "content": "A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreak\nKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:\nThe number of overnight coronavirus deaths in the country has dropped below 300 for the first time in weeks. On Sunday, children under 14 were allowed out to exercise for the first time since mid-March, and the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has announced that adults could also be allowed to exercise outside from next weekend if efforts to contain the spread of the virus continue to pay off.\nThe number of confirmed deaths in the coronavirus pandemic increased to 203,332 on Sunday, according to Johns Hopkins University, with 2,908,527 confirmed cases.\nThe prime minister of France, Edouard Philippe, will on Tuesday present a national strategy for emerging from the coronavirus lockdown to the \u200bnational \u200bassembly, his office told AFP.\nThe British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has rejected calls for setting out the options for easing the lockdown saying this risked confusing the public. Raab said: \u201cUntil we can be confident, based on the scientific advice, that we\u2019ll make sure-footed steps forward which will protect life but also preserve our way of life, frankly, it\u2019s not responsible to start speculating about the individual measures.\u201d He said it would be \u201cunimaginable\u201d to open schools without social distancing measures and said the resumption of amateur sport this summer would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d. But professional sport \u201ccould be different,\u201d he said.\nDominic Raab said a vaccine is \u201cnot likely to come to fruition this year\u201d. He confirmed the government is considering ordering millions of antibody tests to gauge how many people have had the virus, but he cautioned that there was still doubt about the reliability of the tests.\nNarendra Modi gave a radio address to urge its 1.3 billion citizens to strictly comply with the nationwide lockdown as the number of confirmed cases increased steadily despite the month-long curfew. He said the country was in the midst of a \u201cwar\u201d and said Indians must maintain the \u201cpeople-driven\u201d fight and not be misled into believing the spread of the virus has been brought fully under control.\nBeijing\u2019s city government has banned \u201cuncivilised\u201d behaviour, such as not covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, in a new set of regulations to improve public hygiene and combat the coronavirus.\nOfficials in Iran, the worst-hit country in the Middle East, said there were 60 deaths from the coronavirus in the past 24 hours, taking the total to 5,710 \u2013 but down from an average of about 90 over the past 10 days,\nThe World Health Organization has warned against \u201cimmunity passports\u201d for recovered patients, seen as a possible tool for countries preparing to reopen their economies.\nReports have emerged that Donald Trump\u2019s administration is considering replacing its secretary of health and human services, Alex Azar, because of early missteps in the handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\nAs rumours about the health of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un continue to circulate, including reports that he is sheltering from Covid-19, a US-based monitoring group released satellite images of what may have been his train parked at an exclusive resort town in the country\u2019s east.\nA preliminary report, cited by Australia\u2019s chief medical officer as the government advocates the reopening of the country\u2019s schools, says children are unlikely to transmit Covid-19 between each other or to adults.\nState media in Saudi Arabia are reporting that the curfew will be partially lifted for all regions starting Sunday, but that a 24-hour curfew will be maintained in Mecca, according to Reuters. Some economic and commercial activities, including retail stores, will be reopened during Ramadan, from 29 April to 13 May.\nBoris Johnson will return to work on Monday and is \u201craring to go\u201d, a Downing Street spokeswoman has confirmed. He returns to face a dilemma over whether to ease the coronavirus lockdown, as leading scientists warn that the number of new cases remains much too high.",

        "content": "Trans people fear more discrimination as Orb\u00e1n pushes through law defining gender based on \u2018sex at birth\u2019\nHungary\u2019s rightwing government looks likely to push through legislation that will end the legal recognition of trans people by defining gender as \u201cbiological sex based on primary sex characteristics and chromosomes\u201d and thus making it impossible for people to legally change their gender.\nTrans people and rights activists say the law, which has been introduced into parliament as attention is focused on the coronavirus pandemic, will increase discrimination and intolerance towards trans people. Many will try to leave the country, while those who do not have that chance will face daily humiliations.\n\u201cIn Hungary, you need to show your ID to rent a bike, buy a bus pass or to pick up a package at the post office. It basically means coming out as trans to complete strangers, all the time. The good version is they are nice about it, but there are situations where people turn quite hostile,\u201d said Ivett \u00d6rd\u00f6g, a 39-year-old trans woman living in Budapest.\nHungary\u2019s anti-immigration prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has prompted a wave of international criticism during the coronavirus pandemic by adopting legislation that allows him to rule by decree indefinitely. Parliament is still sitting, but instead of focusing on fighting coronavirus, it is dealing with issues such as the new trans legislation.\nBernadett Sz\u00e9l, an independent MP who has opposed the law in parliament\u2019s judicial committee, described it as \u201cevil\u201d and \u201ca step back in time\u201d. During a hearing in the committee, she tried to read out a letter from trans people explaining how harmful the law would be for them, but was shut down by the committee\u2019s chair, who described the letter as \u201cnot relevant\u201d.\nSz\u00e9l also criticised the timing of the bill. \u201cWe have a pandemic going on and all of us should be focusing on two things: healthcare issues and helping people financially to secure their wellbeing. What is happening in Hungary is a scandal,\u201d she said. It is not clear when the bill will be put to a vote, but observers say its passage through committees suggests the government is pushing ahead with it.\nThe law also opens up the possibility that it could target people who have already made a legal change and now live with a gender that does not match their \u201csex at birth\u201d, the planned new gender category on official documents.\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s likely that they don\u2019t plan to go after people who already changed, but we just don\u2019t know,\u201d said Tam\u00e1s Dombos, a board member of the H\u00e1tt\u00e9r Society, a Hungarian organisation focused on LGBTQI rights.\nLegal experts say the new law will be in violation of European human rights case law, leaving it open to challenge in both the Hungarian supreme court and the European court of human rights (ECHR).\n\u201cThere\u2019s very clear case law on this in the ECHR, so it\u2019s very likely it will be challenged soon after it\u2019s implemented. But the court takes years, and the decisions are always individual. People will probably get compensation but it won\u2019t mean they get new documents,\u201d said Dombos.\nUntil 2016, the procedure for legally changing gender in Hungary was fairly straightforward, said Dombos, but for the past three years, authorities have been reluctant to implement the law, meaning there is a backlog of people waiting for decisions on their applications for gender changes. \u201cMy request has been sitting there for a year, and this new law will mean it will be fully rejected,\u201d said \u00d6rd\u00f6g.\nOrb\u00e1n\u2019s government has become more hostile towards the LGBTQ+ community in the past two years, moving from generic language about traditional values and the benefits of heterosexual marriage to openly discriminatory language, such as comparing homosexuality to paedophilia.\n\u201cThis kind of language was not present before, and now it is no longer just discourse, it\u2019s going to become policy,\u201d said Dombos.\nAlthough it will still be possible for people to change their names, in Hungary there is an official register of allowed names compiled by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and this list is gendered. There are no names approved for both genders. \u201cI cannot change my legal name to anything that doesn\u2019t give me away as a trans person,\u201d said \u00d6rd\u00f6g.\nEven without the new law, life for trans people in Hungary is filled with obstacles. Amanda Malovics, a 30-year-old trans woman, left Hungary in 2015 for London, with one suitcase and enough money to last a month, she said, as she felt uncomfortable starting her transition in Hungary.\nIn Britain she has changed her name by deed poll, which means that bank accounts, bills and the rest of her life in London can be conducted under her new name. As soon as she needs to travel, however, she is faced with using her Hungarian passport with her old name and gender. She applied to change her gender in Hungary last year but, like others, has had the application stalled.\n\u201cI live and breathe as a woman, I look like a woman, I am present in myself as a woman and I identify as a woman, but my ID says otherwise. I absolutely hate travelling, because of this. There\u2019s massive fear and anxiety every time,\u201d she said.\nNow, she says, she is waiting until she qualifies for UK citizenship to receive a passport in her new name, and at that point will consider making the difficult decision to revoke her Hungarian citizenship. She believes many other Hungarian trans people will also leave.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pointless for me to belong somewhere where I\u2019m not wanted or welcome,\u201d she said.",

        "content": "Germany\u2019s leading coronavirus expert Christian Drosten on Merkel\u2019s leadership, the UK response and the \u2018prevention paradox\u2019\nChristian Drosten, who directs the Institute of Virology at the Charit\u00e9 Hospital in Berlin, was one of those who identified the Sars virus in 2003. As the head of the German public health institute\u2019s reference lab on coronaviruses, he has become the government\u2019s go-to expert on the related virus causing the current pandemic.\nIn an exclusive interview, Drosten admits he fears a second deadly wave of the virus. He explains why Angela Merkel has an advantage over other world leaders \u2013 and why the \u201cprevention paradox\u201d keeps him awake at night.\nQ: Germany will start to lift its lockdown gradually from Monday. What happens next?\n   A: At the moment, we are seeing half-empty ICUs in Germany. This is because we started diagnostics early and on a broad scale, and we stopped the epidemic \u2013 that is, we brought the reproduction number [a key measure of the spread of the virus] below 1. Now, what I call the \u201cprevention paradox\u201d has set in. People are claiming we over-reacted, there is political and economic pressure to return to normal. The federal plan is to lift lockdown slightly, but because the German states, or L\u00e4nder, set their own rules, I fear we\u2019re going to see a lot of creativity in the interpretation of that plan. I worry that the reproduction number will start to climb again, and we will have a second wave.\nQ: If the lockdown were kept in place longer, could the disease be eradicated?\n  A: There is a group of modellers in Germany who suggest that by prolonging lockdown here for another few weeks, we could really suppress virus circulation to a considerable degree \u2013 bringing the reproduction number below 0.2. I tend to support them but I haven\u2019t completely made up my mind. The reproduction number is just an average, an indication. It doesn\u2019t tell you about pockets of high prevalence such as senior citizens\u2019 homes, where it will take longer to eradicate the disease, and from where we could see a rapid resurgence even if lockdown were extended.\nQ: If there were such a resurgence, could it be contained?\n  A: Yes, but it can\u2019t happen based on human contact-tracing alone. We now have evidence that almost half of infection events happen before the person passing on the infection develops symptoms \u2013 and people are infectious starting two days prior to that. That means that human contact-tracers working with patients to identify those they\u2019ve been exposed to are in a race against time. They need help to catch all those potentially exposed as quickly as possible \u2013 and that will require electronic contact-tracing.\nQ: How close we are to achieving herd immunity?\n  A: To achieve herd immunity we need 60-70% of the population to carry antibodies to the virus. The results of antibody tests suggest that in Europe and the US, in general, we are in the low single digits, but the tests are not reliable \u2013 all of them have problems with false positives \u2013 and herd immunity is also not the whole story. It assumes complete mixing of the population, but there are reasons \u2013 in part to do with the social networks people form \u2013 why the whole population may not be available for infection at any given time. Networks shift, and new people are exposed to the virus. Such effects can drive waves of infection. Another factor that could impact herd immunity is whether other coronaviruses \u2013 those that cause the common cold, for example \u2013 offer protection to this one. We don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s possible.\nQ: Should all countries be testing everybody?\n  A: I\u2019m not sure. Even in Germany, with our huge testing capacity, and most of it directed to people reporting symptoms, we have not had a positivity rate above 8%. So I think targeted testing might be best, for people who are really vulnerable \u2013 staff in hospitals and care homes, for example. This is not fully in place even in Germany, though we\u2019re moving towards it. The other target should be patients in the first week of symptoms, especially elderly patients who tend to come to hospital too late at the moment \u2013 when their lips are already blue and they need intubation. And we need some kind of sentinel surveillance system, to sample the population regularly and follow the development of the reproduction number.\nQ: What is known about the seasonality of the virus?\n  A: Not a lot. The Harvard modelling group led by Marc Lipsitch has suggested that transmission might slow over the summer, but that it will be a small effect. I don\u2019t have better data.\nQ: Can we say for sure that the pandemic started in China?I think so. On the other hand, I don\u2019t assume that it started at the food market in Wuhan. It is more likely to have started where the animal \u2013 the intermediate host \u2013 was bred.\nQ: What do we know about that intermediate host \u2013 is it the \u201cpoor pangolin\u201d, as it\u2019s come to be known?\n  A: I don\u2019t see any reason to assume that the virus passed through pangolins on its way to humans. There is an interesting piece of information from the old Sars literature. That virus was found in civet cats, but also in raccoon dogs \u2013 something the media overlooked. Raccoon dogs are a massive industry in China, where they are bred on farms and caught in the wild for their fur. If somebody gave me a few hundred thousand bucks and free access to China to find the source of the virus, I would look in places where raccoon dogs are bred.\nQ: Will it be useful to identify patient zero \u2013 the first human to have been infected with this virus?\n  A: No. Patient zero is almost certain to have acquired a virus that is very similar to some of the first sequenced viruses, so it wouldn\u2019t help us solve our current problem. I don\u2019t think you could even argue that it would help us prevent future coronavirus pandemics, because humanity will be immune to the next Sars-related coronavirus, having been exposed to this one. Other coronaviruses could pose a threat \u2013 a prime candidate is the Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) virus \u2013 but to understand that threat we have to study how Mers viruses are evolving in camels in the Middle East.\nQ: Are human activities responsible for the spillover of coronaviruses from animals into people?Coronaviruses are prone to switch hosts when there is opportunity, and we create such opportunities through our non-natural use of animals \u2013 livestock. Livestock animals are exposed to wildlife, they are kept in large groups that can amplify the virus, and humans have intense contact with them \u2013 for example through the consumption of meat \u2013 so they certainly represent a possible trajectory of emergence for coronaviruses. Camels count as livestock in the Middle East, and they are the host of the Mers virus as well as human coronavirus 229E \u2013 which is one cause of the common cold \u2013 while cattle were the original hosts for coronavirus OC43, which is another.\nQ: Flu has always been thought to pose the greatest pandemic risk. Is that still the case?\n  A: Certainly, but we can\u2019t rule out another coronavirus pandemic. After the first Ebola outbreak, in 1976, people thought it would never come back again, but it took less than 20 years to do so.\nQ: Is all the science being done around this coronavirus good science?\n  A: No! Early on, in February, there were many interesting preprints [scientific papers that have not yet been peer-reviewed] around. Now you can read through 50 before you find something that\u2019s actually solid and interesting. A lot of research resources are being wasted.\nQ: Angela Merkel has been praised for her leadership during this crisis. What makes her a good leader?She\u2019s extremely well-informed. It helps that she\u2019s a scientist and can handle numbers. But I think it mainly comes down to her character \u2013 her thoughtfulness and ability to reassure. Maybe one of the distinguishing features of a good leader is that they are not using this present situation as a political opportunity. They know how counterproductive that would be.\nQ: From where you stand, how is the UK handling the situation?\n  A: It\u2019s clear that testing was implemented a little bit too late in the UK. Public Health England was in a position to diagnose the disease very early on \u2013 we worked with them to make the diagnostic test \u2013 but rollout in Germany was driven in part by market forces, which made it fast, and that wasn\u2019t the case in the UK. Now, though, I have the impression that the UK is really gaining momentum in this regard, and that it is coordinating testing efforts better than Germany.\nQ: What keeps you awake at night?\n  A: In Germany, people see that the hospitals are not overwhelmed, and they don\u2019t understand why their shops have to shut. They only look at what\u2019s happening here, not at the situation in, say, New York or Spain. This is the prevention paradox, and for many Germans I\u2019m the evil guy who is crippling the economy. I get death threats, which I pass on to the police. More worrying to me are the other emails, the ones from people who say they have three kids and they\u2019re worried about the future. It\u2019s not my fault, but those ones keep me awake at night.",

        "content": "Evidence grows that many Covid-19 patients do better with non-invasive help\nOnly about half of the sickest Covid-19 patients, admitted to intensive care struggling to breathe, are being put on mechanical ventilators, it has emerged, as evidence grows that many do better with non-invasive help.\nThe rush to increase the number of ventilators in Britain from 8,000 to 18,000 was a response to early assumptions that intubation was the only way to save the lives of those who become severely ill. Industry was urged to switch production, and Dyson was among the companies volunteering to help, but it has now been told by the government its services are not needed.\nThis may now look like an over-reaction, but one leading intensive care expert said the government had little choice. The Imperial College modelling prediction of 250,000 UK deaths was based partly on a shortfall in the number of ventilators in the NHS.\n\u201cIt is easy in retrospect,\u201d said Mervyn Singer, a professor of intensive care medicine at University College London. \u201cGovernments had to prepare for the worst and hope for the best. The truth is usually somewhere in the middle.\u201d\nSinger talked to colleagues in China and in Italy about their experiences before the UK\u2019s intensive care units started to fill up. \u201cWe started off with a strategy to try to avoid intubation,\u201d he said.\nThe alternatives to mechanical ventilation include continuous positive airway pressure (Cpap). Cpap machines are a type of ventilator that uses a mask but delivers air at mild pressure without taking over the function of the lungs. It is believed Boris Johnson was treated with Cpap.\nIn recent days the UK has seen a sudden sharp increase in Covid-19 infection numbers, leading to fears that a second wave of cases is beginning.\nEpidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u00a01918 influenza pandemic\u00a0that killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics. Until now that had been what was expected from Covid-19.\nHow and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.\nIs there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?\nThis is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u00a0resurgence in infections\u00a0despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.\nAlthough Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u00a0cramped dormitory accommodation\u00a0used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.\nSingapore\u2019s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.\nIn June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that China had previously been able to lift. In the UK, the city of Leicester was unable to come out of lockdown because of the development of a new spike of coronavirus cases. Clusters also emerged in Melbourne, requiring a re-imposition of lockdown conditions.\nWhat are experts worried about?\nConventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.\nHowever Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, says \u201c\u2018Second wave\u2019 isn\u2019t a term that we would use at the current time, as the virus hasn\u2019t gone away, it\u2019s in our population, it has spread to 188 countries so far, and what we are seeing now is essentially localised spikes or a localised return of a large number of cases.\u201d\u00a0\nThe overall threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.\nIn general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry is that with\u00a0a vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.\nPeter Beaumont,\u00a0Emma Graham-Harrison and Martin Belam\nEarly fears were that healthcare workers would be more likely to be infected by Cpap patients, but at University College hospital that turned out to be unfounded.\nSinger and his colleagues wrote an algorithm for deciding which patients needed intubation and which could be given other forms of breathing support. They launched their care pathway on 20 March, the day that London\u2019s Northwick Park hospital had to declare an emergency and send Covid-19 patients to other hospitals. \u201cThey were intubating everyone as per guidance and ended up with no ventilators left and had to declare a critical emergency,\u201d said Singer.\nAround the world, doctors are increasingly reluctant to use mechanical ventilation for any but the severest cases. A study of outcomes in New York published on Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 88% of those put on mechanical ventilation in critical care units died.\nBut that\u2019s a Catch 22 situation, say UK experts. These were probably the sickest patients, whose lungs were barely functioning and would have died without invasive ventilation.\nProf Anita Simonds, a consultant in respiratory medicine at Royal Brompton hospital, said the very poor outcome in New York patients was \u201cprobably not a fair assessment\u201d because there were still patients in intensive care, so the survival rate may yet go up.\n\u201cMy view, which I think is fairly widely held, is that some of the comparisons being made are not apples and apples. As is appropriate with evolving information, these plans are iterative in how you manage patients. We\u2019ve learned as we\u2019ve gone along,\u201d she said.\nFor maybe 30% or even 50% of Covid patients, non-invasive Cpap ventilation with extra oxygen at high levels can be sufficient. \u201cIf that is sufficient for them, the outcome in that cohort \u2013 survival and other measures like length of time in hospital \u2013 will be better than those who had invasive ventilation. That\u2019s largely because they include a less-ill group of patients,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe group who go on to be intubated, often they\u2019ve had a trial of Cpap which has failed or they\u2019ve deteriorated so rapidly you have no hope of treating them so they have to be intubated. They are sicker patients and their outcome will be poorer.\u201d\nCpap is not the only non-invasive ventilation method being tried for Covid-19 patients. It is one of three now included in a trial called Recovery RS, sister to the Recovery trial for new drug treatments for the disease. Mechanical ventilation is not included.\nSinger said hospitals had to be very careful how they ventilated patients, given the staffing pressures in intensive care units. \u201cI think the general view is that if you can keep a patient off a ventilator, they will do well,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s catch 22. Sicker patients have sicker lungs.\u201d",

Such a condition would amount to coercion, Liberty claims.\nThe academic developing the app has said that tens of millions of people would need to sign up to the app to make it effective.\nClare Collier, the advocacy director at Liberty, said: \u201cBy presenting surveillance tools as a solution to lockdown, the government is drawing on the willingness we have all shown to make sacrifices in the face of this crisis while refusing to show it is taking seriously the enormous risks presented by invasive technology.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cContact-tracing technology may require us to sacrifice deeply sensitive personal information and there can be no question of state bodies or private companies sharing our personal data other than what is absolutely necessary. It is vital no one is coerced into having the app installed, and using it as a condition for returning to work or everyday life will inevitably lead to discrimination.\n\u201cThe opportunities presented by technology should be fully investigated, but seeking quick solutions in surveillance tools that rely on our personal data creates serious long-term threats to our rights and ways of life.\n\u201cContact-tracing technology will only work if 60% of people use it. But people will only use it if they trust their rights are being protected. For this approach to have any hope of helping us beat the virus, privacy safeguards must be hard-wired into the design from the outset.\u201d\nProf Christophe Fraser, of the University of Oxford, who is leading a team developing the app, said it would a require a very high take-up to be effective.\n\u201cFor this intervention alone to stop a resurgence of the epidemic, about 60% of the population would have to use the app,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cThe app is going to be one of the building blocks of how to get out of the epidemic. For every one to two users who download the app and who adhere to the instructions, you will prevent one infection.\u201d\nHe that if a person became infected, the app would send warning messages to anyone who had come within Bluetooth range of their phone. He said: \u201cYou\u2019ll either get a message which says you\u2019ve been in contact with a suspected case of Covid-19. Or you may later get a message and you\u2019ve been a contact of a confirmed case. At that point, we would recommend quarantine of 14 days after the contact has taken place.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cWhen you install the app, this is an opt-in system so it will work in the background. Your phone builds up a memory of the sort of anonymous IDs of the other phones you come into contact with. It needs to be a contact long enough that there\u2019s a risk of transmission.\u201d\nAsked about privacy concerns he said: \u201cThe NHS records patient data already and we trust the NHS to look after private data. This is being developed with a minimal amount of data \u2013 enough to make it work. It\u2019s a public health intervention with data collected within a health system.\u201d",

        "content": "Co-hosts in 2002, South Korea stunned an Azzurri side that included Maldini, Del Piero and Totti\nWatching the highlights online 18 years later really doesn\u2019t bring home how loud it was, from kick-off all the way to the golden goal.\nThe constant noise that came from an ever-rippling sea of red made the instant of silence after 117 minutes of frenzied football all the more jarring. It was replaced by a deafening roar and the sight of local journalists, sweating in the warm South Korean evening, running up and down the press box steps at Daejeon World Cup Stadium.\nAnd there was Ahn Jung-hwan running towards the corner flag, men in blue sinking to the ground and looks of wonderment on the faces of hardnosed hacks. If it was surprising that a striker who was struggling for playing time at Perugia had climbed above Paolo Maldini to send South Korea into the quarter-finals of the 2002 World Cup what really shocked was that Italy were out, losing 2-1 to the Taeguk Warriors.\nHours earlier on the buses that left the city centre to the stadium, packed full of red, there was a feeling that it could be done. Victories over Poland \u2013 a first World Cup win \u2013 and Portugal led Korea to top the group. The nightmare scenario, the reason why Guus Hiddink had been hired, was avoided and South Korea were not going to be the first hosts to exit at the group stage.\nThere was no pressure against Italy and when the Red Devils held up white cards to spell out \u201cAgain 1966\u201d in reference to North Korea\u2019s famous win over the Azzurri in Middlesbrough, the belief that spread around over 40,000 fans was electrifying. Until that is, you looked at the opposition and saw names such as Gianluigi Buffon, Alessandro Del Piero, Francesco Totti and Maldini among others. By contrast, only the two South Korean players, Seol Ki-hyeon at Anderlecht and Ahn in Italy, had any kind of European experience.\nItaly played the group stage in Japan and arrived in central South Korea already unhappy at having had no less than four goals disallowed against Croatia and Mexico. They were to leave the Land of the Morning Calm feeling spicier than the local cuisine though as British commentator Barry Davies said on TV: \u201cAnd the Italians are out because they never learn.\u201d\nThe three-time world champions had sat back on the 18th-minute lead from a Christian Vieri header and allowed the high-energy Koreans to come at them. It almost worked as, with full-time approaching, the Asians looked short of ideas. Three minutes from the end, however, the future Fulham and Reading star Seol took advantage of a Christian Panucci stumble and Ahn, who went on to have an unremarkable club career, did the rest.\nOf course, there was more to the tale such as the red card given to Totti, the second booking for simulation, and a Damiano Tommasi goal being ruled out for offside. It all looks fairly tame when viewed now and, Italians apart, there were few complaints at the time. The defeated team blamed the Ecuadorian referee Byron Moreno, imprisoned nine years later in New York on drug smuggling charges, but they would have gone through had Christian Vieri, who earlier escaped a red for an elbow that broke Kim Tae-young\u2019s nose, not missed an absolute sitter in the final seconds of normal time.\nThe host nation, beneficiaries of clear officiating errors in the quarter-final against Spain, didn\u2019t care and partied like never before. \u201cWe beat one of the world superpowers,\u201d said Hiddink. \u201cWe must celebrate tonight and we will celebrate.\u201d Millions were already on the streets watching and many more soon poured out of homes and restaurants. Hours later, downtown Daejeon was still packed with people.\nThe next day however it was reported that Ahn was to be shown the door at Perugia by the club\u2019s chairman, Luciano Gaucci. \u201cHe was a phenomenon only when he played against Italy,\u201d Gaucci was quoted as saying. \u201cI have no intention of paying a salary to someone who has ruined Italian football.\u201d\nAhn didn\u2019t ruin Italian soccer, as the 2006 World Cup win would show, but he did give me (as well as South Korea and surely Asia) my favourite game.",

After his daily GP work, he would set aside time in the late afternoon for adults, and held group sessions for children on Saturdays.\nHis interest in gender reassignment also began in the early 60s, after he had to help a man who had applied acid to his genitals because he wanted to be a woman. Thereafter Don forged links with various people, both medical and otherwise (including the transgender pioneers April Ashley and Jan Morris), in a bid to gain a better understanding of the issue. He soon became one of the few GPs at the time who was competent in the medical assessment of people who wanted sex reassignment surgery.\nDon was born in Cape Town in South Africa, one of six children to Florrie (nee Bruinders), a \u201cCape coloured\u201d, and Mohamed Ebrahim, a self-employed businessman who had migrated from India in 1899. After school, Don enrolled at the University of Cape Town medical school in 1948, just as apartheid was introduced. He opted to complete his training in the UK, with the idea of returning as the first Cape coloured doctor in the inner city District Six of Cape Town.\nAfter qualifying at Sheffield University medical school in 1952 he married Marjorie Evans, a British nurse, and they had four children. He did two years of UK national service in the Royal Army Medical Corps, stationed in Trieste and Hanover, and then in 1956 attempted to return to Cape Town to set up his GP practice. However, the South African government blocked his re-entry on the grounds that he was now in a mixed-race marriage.\nInstead he remained in the UK to set up his practise in Coventry, providing services for more than 3,500 people in the local area. His surgery was an integral part of the family home and he was on call most nights.\nDon continued to practice hypnotherapy until he was in his 80s. He lectured widely on the value of hypnosis for common mental health problems, and was awarded the Annie Fasth Foundation prize for his development of traumatic separation theory, which traced the roots of some mental health problems to unresolved and painful separations (for instance, through parental divorce) at a young age.\nMarjorie died in 1971, aged 40, and Don got married again, in 1982, to Ivy Brinley-Richards, who died in 1992. He is survived by four sons from his first marriage, Rusty, Kim, Omar and me.",

Among her most notable feats was her participation, in the 1950s, in the first all-female expedition to the Himalayas, about which she wrote a book.\nMonica was born in Kotagiri, India, to Scottish parents, Heather (nee Kinloch) and her husband, Ralph Morris, who had bought land in the state of Mysore, where they set up a coffee plantation.\nLargely self-taught up to the age of 10, Monica was eventually sent, with her sister, Sheila, to boarding school in the UK, in the village of Arlesey in Bedfordshire. At 16 she went to Benington College in the US, but when the second world war broke out she cut off her studies and returned to India.\n There Monica met and married Bob Jackson, an advertising executive. They had two children, Sue and me, and the family moved in 1949 to London, from where we would often go on long visits to a family cottage in the highland village of Tomintoul in Scotland.\nIt was there that Monica became a member of the Ladies Scottish Climbing Club. In 1955 she and two Scottish climbers, Evelyn Camrass (later McNicol) and Betty Stark, set off on the first all-female expedition to the Himalayas, exploring an unvisited area of the Jugal Himal in Nepal and making the first ascent of a 20,000ft peak which they named Gyalgen after one of their Sherpas. She and Stark wrote a book about their adventures, Tents in the Clouds, which was published in 1957. \n  Thereafter Monica was a very active climber in Britain and abroad. She climbed in the Cilo Da\u011f\u0131 in eastern Turkey (an expedition recorded in her 1966 book The Turkish Time Machine), in the Atlas mountains in Morocco and in the Alps and Dolomites.\nWhile her children were at boarding school, Monica was based permanently for several years at Tomintoul until, after a spell in the south of England, she and Bob ran the Stein Inn on the Isle of Skye. In her 50s she took a degree in archaeology and anthropology at Cambridge University and subsequently undertook research in India funded by the Ministry of Overseas Development. Based in an area not far from where she was born, she wrote a thesis on caste and kinship, and finished her doctorate at Edinburgh University in 1976, followed by a book, Going Back, describing both her early years in India and her later demographic research in the country.\n  From the mid-1970s she was based in Edinburgh, and though she no longer climbed, she continued to go regularly to the Highlands to walk up as many Munros (Scottish mountains over 3,000ft) as she could. She remained young in spirit until the last few months of her life.\nBob died in 1986. She is survived by her two children, three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.",

        "content": "Letter signed by hundreds of creative figures including PJ Harvey, Anish Kapoor and Rufus Wainwright calls on government support\nMore than 400 of the UK\u2019s leading artists, musicians and creative figures including Nick Cave, PJ Harvey, Meera Syal, Simon Callow and Johnny Marr have signed a letter calling on the government to release funds to support the creative industries, warning that unless more is done the country could become \u201ca cultural wasteland\u201d because of the economic damage done during the Covid-19 outbreak.\nThe letter, which is written by Creative Industries Federation (CIF) and addressed to the chancellor and culture secretary, appeals for urgent funding for creative organisations and professionals who, it says, are \u201cfalling through the gaps of existing government support measures\u201d.\nSignatories of the letter also include Anish Kapoor, Jeremy Deller and Jonathan Pryce, who argue the government \u201ccannot allow the UK to lose half of its creative businesses and become a cultural wasteland\u201d.\nThe singer Rufus Wainwright, who also signed, told the Guardian artists \u201cprotect the minds and souls of a nation\u201d, and it could be \u201ccriminal\u201d for the UK to not support them during the crisis.\nHe said: \u201cArtists are creating so much content online that people can experience in their homes. They have not stopped producing and it would be a crime as a society to not support them through this crisis as they are nourishing us.\u201d\nWainwright added that Germany, which announced a federal aid package worth \u20ac50bn (\u00a343 bn) for freelancers and small businesses with Berlin distributing \u20ac5,000 payments to individual freelancers (including artists), was a country that has effectively supported the arts and the creative industries.\nIn March, the UK chancellor, Rishi Sunak, unveiled plans to pay self-employed workers up to 80% of their recent earnings, but was criticised when industry groups claimed many were ineligible for any financial support under the scheme.\nArts Council England also announced a \u00a3160m emergency response package that gives artists access to cash grants of up to \u00a32,500, with \u00a350m available for organisations outside its national portfolio, and another \u00a390m going to national portfolio organisations.\nCaroline Norbury, CEO of CIF, said the creative sector was in \u201cdeep trouble\u201d despite the government funding meant to support workers who have been affected by Covid-19 lockdown measures.\nShe said: \u201cWhile government support measures for businesses and the self-employed are welcome, we know that there are still thousands of creative organisations and freelancers who are falling through the gaps, and who simply will not get through this crisis without urgent cash support.\u201d\nThe letter also references CIF research that shows that one in seven creative organisations have reserves to last until the end of April, with half having money that will last beyond June.\nThe letter is the latest appeal for support from the government by leading British cultural figures. Last week, the artistic director of the National Theatre, Rufus Norris, told the Guardian that some theatres had only days before they could go out of business and urged the government to offer more support to freelancers.\n\u201cIf the furlough scheme doesn\u2019t continue, yet we stay closed as an industry, then it\u2019s very hard to imagine how the sector will survive,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like the government to increase and broaden the support of freelance artists who are suffering very badly.\u201d\nNorris\u2019s comments followed those of the playwright James Graham who said an \u201caggressive government bailout\u201d was the way to ensure the sector survived Covid-19 and that \u201cworking-class actors and artists might be the ones who struggle to find themselves back on those platforms and in those spaces\u201d.\nThe international curator Hans-Ulrich Obrist told the Guardian a multimillion pound public arts programme, similar in scale to Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s Public Works of Art Project (PWAP) and Works Progress Administration (WPA), which was rolled out during the Great Depression in the 1930s, was needed to support artists during and after the Covid-19 outbreak.",

A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy did not dispute that Covid-19 Sage meetings marked the first time political advisers had attended.\n\u201cThe nature and scale of this emergency, which is impacting the UK in a more direct manner, differs from those that Sage has been mobilised for in the past and, as such, the rotating expert attendance and list of government officials involves a broader set of representatives,\u201d the spokesperson said. Downing Street did not dispute the minutes.\nThe government has been adopting an unusually combative approach to journalists in recent weeks after a slew of articles by investigative reporters raised questions about how ministers are responding to the Covid-19 pandemic.\nOn Friday, when the Guardian revealed Cummings had attended Sage, Downing Street released a statement saying: \u201cPublic confidence in the media has collapsed during this emergency partly because of ludicrous stories such as this.\u201d\nLast week, after the Sunday Times investigative report criticised Boris Johnson for failing take the pandemic seriously, the Department of Health published a blogpost saying the article contained \u201ca series of falsehoods\u201d and \u201cactively misrepresents\u201d the government\u2019s response. The Sunday Times flatly denied the \u201ckremlinesque\u201d accusations from the government.\nAfter the Financial Times last week exposed the \u201cmuddled thinking\u201d behind the government\u2019s ventilator procurement plan, the Cabinet Office reacted with an almost 3,000-word retaliation, which also took aim at the personal tweets by the newspaper\u2019s journalist Peter Foster.\nReacting to Downing Street\u2019s trenchant criticism of the Guardian\u2019s reporting on Cummings and Sage over the weekend, Foster tweeted it was reminiscent of techniques used by Donald Trump\u2019s White House to \u201cmuddy waters, create world of equal and alternative \u2018facts\u2019 and traduce media\u201d.",

        "content": "Scientists on UK government\u2019s coronavirus advisory group say Dominic Cummings was an active participant\nThe involvement of the prime minister\u2019s chief political adviser, Dominic Cummings, in meetings of the scientific group advising the UK government\u2019s response to the coronavirus has left other attendees shocked, concerned and worried for the impartiality of advice, the Guardian can reveal.\nOne attendee of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said they felt Cummings\u2019 interventions had sometimes inappropriately influenced what is supposed to be an impartial scientific process.\nA second Sage attendee said they were shocked when Cummings first began participating in Sage discussions, in February, because they believed the group should be providing \u201cunadulterated scientific data\u201d without any political input.\nThe Guardian\u2019s revelation on Friday that Sage attendees have included Cummings and Ben Warner, who worked together on the Vote Leave campaign for Brexit, caused a storm of controversy over the weekend.\nIn recent days the UK has seen a sudden sharp increase in Covid-19 infection numbers, leading to fears that a second wave of cases is beginning.\nEpidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u00a01918 influenza pandemic\u00a0that killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics. Until now that had been what was expected from Covid-19.\nHow and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.\nIs there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?\nThis is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u00a0resurgence in infections\u00a0despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.\nAlthough Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u00a0cramped dormitory accommodation\u00a0used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.\nSingapore\u2019s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.\nIn June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that China had previously been able to lift. In the UK, the city of Leicester was unable to come out of lockdown because of the development of a new spike of coronavirus cases. Clusters also emerged in Melbourne, requiring a re-imposition of lockdown conditions.\nWhat are experts worried about?\nConventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.\nHowever Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, says \u201c\u2018Second wave\u2019 isn\u2019t a term that we would use at the current time, as the virus hasn\u2019t gone away, it\u2019s in our population, it has spread to 188 countries so far, and what we are seeing now is essentially localised spikes or a localised return of a large number of cases.\u201d\u00a0\nThe overall threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.\nIn general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry is that with\u00a0a vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.\nPeter Beaumont,\u00a0Emma Graham-Harrison and Martin Belam\nDowning Street is insisting there is nothing untoward about the pair\u2019s attendance at Sage meetings, saying they are largely taking part as silent observers.\n\u201cIt is factually wrong and damaging to sensible public debate to imply [Sage] advice is affected by government advisers listening to discussions,\u201d a Downing Street spokesperson said. \u201cIt is entirely right that No 10 advisers attend to better understand the scientific debate and the decisions that need to be taken.\u201d\n However, the two other Sage attendees the Guardian spoke to painted a different picture to that presented by No 10, which has been striving to play down the influence of the two advisers. Both Sage attendees declined to be named.\n\u201cI have been concerned sometimes that Sage has become too operational, so we\u2019ve ended up looking as though we are making decisions,\u201d one of them said, making clear that Cummings had been involved on those occasions. \u201cIt contravenes previous guidelines about how you make sure you get impartial scientific advice going through to politicians, who make the decisions.\u201d\nReferring to both Cummings and Warner, the Sage attendee added: \u201cWhen a very senior civil servant or a very well-connected person interrupts, then I don\u2019t think anyone in the room feels the power to stop it. When you get to discussing where advice might be going, there have been occasions where they have been involved, and a couple of times I\u2019ve thought: that\u2019s not what we are supposed to be doing.\u201d\nA second Sage attendee said Cummings had played an active role meetings from February onwards. They said they were initially shocked to discover Cummings was taking part in a meeting of supposedly independent scientific experts.\n\u201cHe was not just an observer, he\u2019s listed as an active participant,\u201d the source said. \u201cHe was engaging in conversation and not sitting silently.\u201d The second attendee said Cumming\u2019s involvement was worrying because of his reputation in Whitehall and the questions his participation raises about Sage\u2019s role as a neutral body of expert advisers.\nThe reaction from the two Sage attendees contrasts with that of Prof Neil Ferguson, the Imperial College epidemiologist whose models have played a guiding role in the government\u2019s response to Covid-19. He appeared unconcerned when asked, in a video interview, about Cummings attending Sage meetings. \u201cThere have been a number of observers at those meetings, who have not interfered with business at all,\u201d he replied.\nSage membership is not fixed, but changes according to the nature of the crisis being faced. Independent scientific experts on the group are supposed to assess evidence impartially and pass their advice to Cobra, the civil contingencies committee convened in the Cabinet Office.\nThe advisory group is chaired by the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, who also decides which experts take part. Asked whether Vallance had also given his approval to Cummings and Warner coming to his meetings, a government spokesperson said Vallance \u201cwould not have to sign off\u201d observers or representatives from government departments.\n The chief medical officers and chief scientific advisers from the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are classified as observers on Sage. However, unlike Cummings and Warner, they are unable to ask questions unless they are submitted in writing in advance.\nGeorge Eustice, the environment secretary, was asked about the makeup of Sage during Sunday\u2019s Downing Street press conference.\nHe said it was \u201cconvened in response to specific emergencies, and the scientists that go on to that group will change, depending on the type of emergency.\u201d He said minutes of its deliberations would eventually be published.\nStephen Powis, the national medical director for England, appearing alongside Eustice, said he would have \u201cno problem\u201d with the names of those who attend being made public, provided their personal permission had been sought. Chief medical officer Chris Whitty has previously said the same thing.\nOn Saturday, Labour urged the government to ban political advisers from attending Sage. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said there were significant questions for the government to answer over the credibility of its decision-making and how non-scientists have influenced policy.\nHe said Cummings was \u201ca political adviser, not a medical or scientific expert. If the public are to have confidence in Sage, the government must make clear Dominic Cummings can no longer participate or attend.\u201d\nThe Conservative former Brexit secretary, David Davis, also criticised the attendance of Cummings and Warner at the Sage meetings. \u201cThe whole point of having Sage is you\u2019re getting scientific advice based on the data, based on the best theories, and the best models we have at the time,\u201d he told Sky News. \u201cYou don\u2019t want any outside influences, either direct or indirect, either deliberate or accidental.\u201d\nHowever the former Conservative chancellor, Sajid Javid, argued it would be \u201cworrying\u201d if Cummings was not present at the Sage\u2019s Covid-19 meetings, and criticised the Guardian\u2019s reporting. \u201cMedia have a hugely important role in holding government to account, but some are courting public mistrust with non-stories,\u201d Javid tweeted. \u201cTime to act more responsibly.\u201d\nThe foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said the government does not release the membership of the Sage committee because of the risk of pressure on members: \u201cSage do release their advice subsequently, normally a couple of weeks down the track, so it is properly tested carefully before being put out. We don\u2019t release, as a matter of practice, the names of all the members of Sage because the risk of them being subject to pressure, undue influence.\u201d",

        "content": "The US Olympic gold medallist, and the last person to beat Simone Biles, has seen her final year of competition come to an abrupt end\nFor most of the past 20 years, gymnastics is the only thing that Kyla Ross has known. She was doing handstands by four years old, she was an Olympic gold medallist by 15 and this year at 23 she was finishing an exceptional college gymnastics career at UCLA. This was supposed to be the season that tied all the loose ends as she achieved her final goals and then departed into the night. Instead, Ross watched helplessly as the coronavirus outbreak had the final say, briskly sending her into retirement.\nFor a full week in mid-March, each new day brought one more blow in a series of gut punches for college athletes. First they learned that their meets would be audience-free, then the Pac-12 national competition was scuppered, then the entire season was cancelled. By 12 March, universities were closing down. After teams held emergency meetings filled with tears and farewells, senior athletes across the United States spent the trip home trying to come to terms with the mortality of their careers.\nAs a gymnast, the sting was even more severe for Ross. Even in a world of questionable judging and suffocating coaches, a gymnast steps up on to the podium alone. Only their actions determine the quality of their performance. As the world shut down, so too did her autonomy.\n\u201cHonestly, that was probably one of the longest weeks of my life,\u201d says Ross in a phone interview. \u201cIt was all out of our control. Usually, you have this expectation in your mind of how you want your season to end and you usually have control of being out there on the competition floor. But just having the news given to you and told that you\u2019re done is the hardest.\u201d\nRoss is a rarity among the college athletes. She also happens to be one of the best gymnasts of the past decade. The youthful nature of women\u2019s gymnastics means that those who attend university complete the cycle back to front; they chase their Olympic dreams, retire from elite level, and only then head off to class.\nIn Ross\u2019s first year as a senior gymnast, she marched into the monstrous 2012 US Olympic team at 15 and projected all the composure in the world to help USA win team gold. She says she was too young to open her eyes and take it all in. She does not really remember much.\n\u201cI think it was just like: \u2018OK, this is another meet. Yes, it may be the Olympics but this is my life.\u2019 Now looking back, it\u2019s sunk in more. Being at UCLA, seeing how people react. People my age are still like: \u2018Oh my god, I watched you growing up!\u201d\nFor her teammates, her presence is like Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 rolling up to college after winning the World Cup. She is famed for her smoothness on every single skill, her consistency and the mental grit that glued her routines together. In 2013 she won three world championship silver medals and led Simone Biles going into the final rotation of the all around. She remains the last person to beat Biles.\nThe conditions in which she and her teammates competed have come to define recent gymnastics headlines. As the entire 2012 Olympic team stepped forward against Larry Nassar, the toxic culture of Marta Karolyi\u2019s camps was revealed. However, college is often different. The gymnasts are hellbent on pairing fierce competition with enjoyment, friendship and an enriching culture. Ross\u2019s UCLA head coach, Chris Waller, describes college gymnastics as \u201ca pep rally for learning life lessons\u201d.\nWhen Ross first entered the UCLA training gym, the environment unsettled her. People were actually smiling. The tension and pressure she associated with training for big events was absent. It took time for her to feel comfortable actually enjoying herself.\n\u201c[At elite level] we\u2019re just so used to being in high-pressure situations, which is good, but I think we would take it a little bit too seriously. The same as in training - in college, I was honestly more nervous to train than compete.\u201d\nSimilar awakenings came away from the gym. During her youth, Ross\u2019s siblings would head to the beach every day, enjoying their regular childhoods while her life revolved around gymnastics. It never occurred to her that she was missing a vast array of life experiences and she never questioned it. Reality struck as she met her peers in her first year.\n\u201cIt was crazy just talking to other student athletes,\u201d she says. \u201cEven though they still devoted a lot of time to their sport, they were able to experience a lot more things than I had. Just coming into my freshman year, it sunk in how many sacrifices I did have to make compared to my peers who were the same age as me.\u201d Ross initially struggled to open up, but by the end of her freshman year she had grown into an adventurous young adult and was transforming for good.\n\u201cFrom everything I\u2019ve heard, she\u2019s always been that athlete who would stop at nothing to win,\u201d says Waller. \u201cShe didn\u2019t really have a rounded life. What she did over the course of her time at UCLA is figure out how to have integrity in everything. To balance academic, athletic, friendship, teamwork, fun \u2026 she literally does it all and we\u2019re all still trying to figure out how she does.\u201d\nThe personal growth was reflected clearly in competition. Ross\u2019s final years were a stream of perfect 10s and collegiate records. She has one year left of her molecular, cell and developmental biology major and after a short internship in a medical company she will spend it as a coach. She is still processing the end of her career, but the greatest gift of her maturation is that she is equipped with sufficient perspective to know that she is just fine.\n\u201cLooking back at my elite career, I kind of had the same ending,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the perfect ending I was looking for. But I can\u2019t just think that competition is what\u2019s going to define my career. I have to think about all the other accomplishments and experiences, and I think by doing that it helps people get that sense of closure to be happy with how they were able to handle what was given to them.\u201d",

        "content": "Reports of angry residents blocking roads and confronting cyclists during coronavirus lockdown cause concern\nSome rural dwellers in England have turned to vigilantism by attempting to block roads, confront cyclists and erect signs in an effort to deter people from travelling to the countryside for exercise during the lockdown, the Guardian has been told.\nThe National Rural Crime Network has received reports of \u201csmall-scale vigilantism\u201d by some residents growing angry at people driving long distances to the countryside, including beauty spots, for walks or cycle rides. In a worrying development, the organisation\u2019s chair said people had even been \u201caggressively driving at cyclists\u201d.\nTheir behaviour has caused concern with those who point out people enjoying the countryside to exercise are not necessarily breaking government rules if they maintain physical distancing, with one police leader warning vigilantes not to take the law into their own hands.\nThe Guardian has learned of a case in the Lake District where an abusive note was left on the windscreen of a family\u2019s car by a man who also threatened to damage their vehicle after they drove four miles from their home to go for a walk.\nThe reports come after the National Police Chiefs Council and the National College of Policing issued new advice earlier in the month clarifying that driving to the countryside for walks \u2013 where more time is spent walking than travelling \u2013 is among a list of reasonable excuses for people leaving their home during the coronavirus lockdown. It followed criticism of perceived heavy-handed examples of policing during the lockdown, including Derbyshire police using drone footage to shame people going to the countryside to walk. Forces have powers to impose \u00a360 fines to people who break lockdown measures.\nThe National Rural Crime Network, along with the National Farmers\u2019 Union, Countryside Alliance and Country Land and Business Association wrote to the justice secretary on 20 April, calling for an urgent review of the guidance as they highlighted concerns the guidance would \u201cencourage even more people to carry out unnecessarily long journeys to exercise in rural areas, which will in turn put increased pressures on rural police forces and communities\u201d.\nJulia Mulligan, the National Rural Crime Network chair who is also the Conservative police, fire and crime commissioner for North Yorkshire, said people travelling to the countryside for exercise was causing anxiety. She told the Guardian: \u201cWe\u2019ve had small-scale vigilantism, if you like, so communities blocking off roads, people driving aggressively at cyclists.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cPeople have been making it clear that people coming from long distances to enjoy our local beauty spots that are not local to them are not welcome \u2026 There have been signs put up, we\u2019ve had people calling cyclists out. All sorts of little things, nothing that is criminal but people really making it clear how anxious they feel.\u201d\nBut she made clear it was not acceptable for people to be abusive to cyclists. Asked whether she was concerned that those involved in vigilantism may themselves end up falling foul of the law, she said: \u201cYes, absolutely. And what it\u2019s doing is creating tension in communities. And we don\u2019t want tension \u2013 we\u2019ve all got to come out of this the other side of this.\u201d\nSeparately, a mother-of-two from Cumbria \u2013 who does not wish to be named \u2013 said her family returned to their car parked on a main road after driving four miles for a walk in the Lake District on 7 April to find an abusive note.\nThe local man who left the note also threatened to damage their car, the woman said, adding: \u201cI then phoned Cumbria police to check if we were at fault and they assured me we were perfectly at liberty to walk locally and drive a couple of miles to start our walk. Since then we haven\u2019t dared drive from our house and our two kids are quite nervous about meeting anyone.\u201d She declined to press charges against the man. Cumbria police confirmed it offered advice to a woman who called on 7 April asking about walking on the fells.\nPaul Griffiths, the Police Superintendents\u2019 Association president, Paul Griffiths, said he did not encourage vigilantism and instead urged people to contact the police.\nA NPCC spokeswoman also encouraged people to report concerns to police, adding: \u201cPolice forces and the government have rightly continued to advise the public not travel to travel long distances in the car to exercise, and police will use discretion and judgment in deciding what is and what isn\u2019t \u2018necessary\u2019 and \u2018reasonable\u2019 in the circumstances \u2013 being mindful of the purpose of the regulations to prevent transmission of infection. \u201d\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cThe overwhelming majority of people are doing the right thing by staying home \u2026 The police have the powers to both encourage people and, if necessary, enforce these measures.\u201d",

        "content": "Geoffrey Robertson recommends Australian model allowing defendants to opt for trial by judge only\nDefendants should be allowed to opt for trial by judge rather than in front of a jury, a prominent human rights lawyer has proposed, as a means of partially restarting the criminal justice system.\nGeoffrey Robertson QC, a barrister who has served as an international tribunal judge, believes British courts could follow many Australian states that permit the accused to choose a hearing without the traditional jury of 12 men and women.\nJury trials in England and Wales have stopped due to the coronavirus lockdown. Even before then, backlogs were building up in the criminal justice system because the Ministry of Justice rationed the number of sitting days in order to save money.\nJury trials involve packing a dozen people in close proximity into a court and retiring room. Like pubs and restaurants, juries may be one of the last institutions to resume if the threat of coronavirus lingers.\nIn recent days the UK has seen a sudden sharp increase in Covid-19 infection numbers, leading to fears that a second wave of cases is beginning.\nEpidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u00a01918 influenza pandemic\u00a0that killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics. Until now that had been what was expected from Covid-19.\nHow and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.\nIs there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?\nThis is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u00a0resurgence in infections\u00a0despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.\nAlthough Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u00a0cramped dormitory accommodation\u00a0used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.\nSingapore\u2019s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.\nIn June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that China had previously been able to lift. In the UK, the city of Leicester was unable to come out of lockdown because of the development of a new spike of coronavirus cases. Clusters also emerged in Melbourne, requiring a re-imposition of lockdown conditions.\nWhat are experts worried about?\nConventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.\nHowever Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, says \u201c\u2018Second wave\u2019 isn\u2019t a term that we would use at the current time, as the virus hasn\u2019t gone away, it\u2019s in our population, it has spread to 188 countries so far, and what we are seeing now is essentially localised spikes or a localised return of a large number of cases.\u201d\u00a0\nThe overall threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.\nIn general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry is that with\u00a0a vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.\nPeter Beaumont,\u00a0Emma Graham-Harrison and Martin Belam\nIn an article for the Guardian, Robertson, who was born in Australia, argues: \u201cWe believe sentimentally that trial by jury is a defendant\u2019s fundamental right \u2013 but why not give them the additional right to choose instead a reasoned verdict from a judge \u2013 as they have, for example, in most Australian states.\n\u201cThat would get some courts back and running, even if barristers and judges have to argue through their face mask,s and it would be a boon to defendants with good cases who do not want justice delayed,\u201d he wrote.\nFurthermore, Robertson said: \u201cThere are cases in Britain where justice would be better served, and defendants would be better off, if they could choose trial by judge alone.\n\u201cProvision of [the Australian states\u2019] jury waiver option will not lead to the demise of a form of trial that has so much public acceptance, in particular because it involves the public in the delivery of justice. None of the Australian states which allow defendants (but not prosecutors) to waive jury trials have moved on to abolish juries.\u201d\nTrial by a jury is a venerated practice, dating back to Anglo-Saxon times. However, there are already significant exceptions.\nDuring the Troubles in Northern Ireland, cases involving paramilitaries were heard without a jury for fear of jury intimidation. Judges would hear evidence then sum up as though addressing a jury before delivering a verdict.\nIn 2007, Diplock courts, as they were known, were abolished except where Northern Ireland\u2019s director of public prosecutions certifies the administration of justice might be impaired by a jury trial. A former soldier, Dennis Hutchings, is due to face trial in Belfast in a Diplock court this year.\nNon-jury trials are also permitted in England and Wales where jury tampering is suspected. In one 2011 case, a recorder in north London had to discharge a jury and complete the trial on her own.\nEarly in the lockdown, the Scottish government suggested abandoning jury trials temporarily but had to drop the proposal following an outcry.\nThis month, Justice, a legal reform organisation, experimented with online trials in which jury members heard a case remotely from their homes. HM Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS) has said it has no plans for trials with juries participating from home.\nLast week, it was announced \u201ca judicial working group\u201d has been established \u201cto consider ways to restart some jury trials once it is safe to do so\u201d. It includes representatives from the Law Society, Bar Council, Criminal Bar Association (CBA), HMCTS, Crown Prosecution Service and other agencies.\nThe Lord Chief Justice, Lord Burnett of Maldon, has said: \u201cI personally don\u2019t think it realistic to think the jury could be in a different place ... jury trials are the clearest example of what will be most difficult to get back to normal.\u201d\nThe CBA, which represents barristers in England and Wales, fears jury trials are under threat. Its chair, Caroline Goodwin QC, said: \u201cThere is no substitution for both open and efficient justice by having a live trial in a physical space with jurors, barristers, a judge, witnesses and defendants all able to engage fully and solemnly with the full range of verbal, non-verbal and visual cues.\u201d\n This article was amended on 30 April 2020 because an earlier version was incorrect to refer to the latest edition of the Crown Court Compendium as making changes to the language judges can use when addressing jurors about the standard of proof.",

They include an agreement that no customers should be cut off during the lockdown.\nNatalie Hitchins, from the consumer group, Which?, said: \u201cMany customers will have been financially impacted by the coronavirus, so it is concerning to hear that any energy supplier is using debt collectors to place pressure on customers who could be struggling during this difficult time, despite agreeing with the government to support customers in financial distress.\u201d\nThe UK\u2019s largest energy suppliers, British Gas and Ovo Energy, said they were continuing to use debt collectors to engage with their customers. Both companies said they had instructed their debt collectors to offer financial help on their behalf.\nE.on UK, which merged with npower last year, said it was not handing any new customer details to third-party debt collection agencies but that its debt collectors would continue to pursue long-standing debts built up before the outbreak.\nA spokesman for Shell Energy said a letter from a debt collection company \u201cis a last-resort attempt to engage with a customer and only after we\u2019ve repeatedly asked them to get in contact to see how we can help\u201d.\nAccording to a government spokesman, some suppliers had offered to defer payment deadlines by up to three months and had also suspended following up on debts as part of a package of measures to help households weather the Covid-19 crisis.\n\u201cThis is a worrying time for people across the country and we would expect energy companies to take the current circumstances into account as they carry out their business,\u201d the spokesman said.\nThere are also growing concerns over debt collectors who are targeting the UK\u2019s microbusinesses, which are often family-run and may have been hard-hit by the lockdown measures put in place to stop the spread of the virus.\nEd Dodman, a director at the Energy Ombudsman, said: \u201cWhat we have noticed in the early days of the lockdown is that the proportion of financially vulnerable microbusinesses coming to us for assistance is higher than it was before the outbreak, indicating that small businesses, in particular, may be struggling with these issues.\n\u201cThe guidance is quite clear that energy suppliers must consider whether their customers are in financial difficulty and whether they can offer assistance. This is not a carte blanche for customers to avoid paying bills but suppliers should be sensitive to the circumstances of their customers on a case by case basis.\u201d",

        "content": "Several other EU countries have already announced a tentative easing of restrictions\nFrance, Italy and Spain are preparing to loosen coronavirus restrictions, with other countries watching closely to see how some of the first and hardest-hit countries in Europe might safely emerge from their crippling lockdowns.\nAfter the US, where the number of infections is heading towards the 1m mark, with more than 53,000 deaths, the three countries have the highest numbers of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University.\nThe global death toll from the coronavirus pandemic passed 200,000 on Saturday, with more than 2.9m confirmed cases, rising rapidly in many countries but slowing in others because of lockdowns.\nDecisions on how and when to reopen will be vital to how people and businesses can cope with the pandemic, balancing the need for economies to restart with the risks of new outbreaks and further shutdowns.\nIn Italy, which was the first European country to impose a lockdown in March, and where there have so far been close to 200,000 infections and at least 26,384 deaths, Giuseppe Conte said manufacturing could restart as soon as 4 May.\nThe Italian prime minister said schools, however, would not reopen until September. Measures would be announced early this week, he told Italian daily La Repubblica.\nTight lockdowns have been seen as a blunt but effective tool to halt infections until a vaccine is developed.\nSome countries have imposed less restrictive measures, for example Sweden, where shops, restaurants and junior schools have stayed open. Possibly as a result, Sweden\u2019s death rate from Covid-19 is nearly 200 per million people, compared with 31 per million in neighbouring Finland and 36 per million in Norway.\nThe country\u2019s chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, has argued that the effectiveness of lockdowns and border closures has not yet been properly analysed and that Sweden\u2019s high infection rate might help it in the future as more people will become immune.\nHowever, Sweden\u2019s deputy prime minister, Isabella L\u00f6vin, told the BBC it was not yet fully clear if people who had been infected would be immune. She also said the country had a \u201cbig problem\u201d with its main strategy after outbreaks in elderly care homes.\nThere was debate at the weekend on the topic of immunity after the World Health Organization (WHO) said there was no evidence that people who had recovered were immune. After criticism from scientists, the agency rowed back, clarifying that it expected people to develop some level of protection but that it was not clear how much and how long it would last.\nUnlike Sweden, France has imposed a mandatory tight lockdown for weeks. The country\u2019s prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, said he would present a national exit strategy to parliament on Tuesday, which would then debate and vote on the recommendations.\nThe pandemic has killed at least 22,614 people in France, with officials on Saturday reporting 369 new deaths in the previous 24 hours.\nSeventeen priorities have been identified for bringing France out of lockdown. These include reopening schools, companies returning to work, getting public transport back to normal, the supply of masks and sanitiser, testing policy and support for elderly people.\nIn Spain, health authorities have also begun to outline plans for a move towards \u201ca new normality\u201d as the number of overnight coronavirus deaths in the country dropped below 300 for the first time in weeks. As of Sunday, children under 14 were allowed out to exercise for the first time since mid-March, and the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, announced that adults could also be allowed to exercise outside from next weekend.\nSpeaking on Sunday, Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the head of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies, said recent figures showed a \u201cclear descending trend\u201d. The government\u2019s decision to allow some non-essential workers to return to their jobs a fortnight ago had not had any negative impact so far, he said.\nSpain has confirmed a total of 207,634 cases and recorded 23,190 deaths, its health ministry reported. The growth rate of new cases stands at 0.8% \u2013 down from 3% in recent weeks and 38% when the state of emergency was declared on 14 March.\nSeveral other European countries, including Belgium, Greece and Malta, have already announced a tentative easing of restrictions. Elsewhere, there has been pressure to lift the lockdown. In Jerusalem, Israeli police clashed with merchants at a fruit and vegetable market that was prevented from reopening on Sunday while other highstreets shops were.\nIn Berlin, dozens of protesters were arrested on Saturday for a demonstration against the lockdown.\nHowever, Hong Kong\u2019s top epidemiologist has warned against easing lockdowns in Europe too soon, saying \u201cyou need a sledgehammer\u201d to bring down the rate of infections first.\nWorldwide, a lack of testing and discrepancies in reporting from country to country make it impossible to fully track where and how the virus is spreading.\nIn Africa, the crisis appeared to be just beginning. A sudden rise of more than 40% in the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases during the last 10 days across the continent \u2013 to 30,300 \u2013 and a similar increase in the number of deaths \u2013 to 1,374 \u2013 has worried specialists.\nThe WHO has warned of 10 million cases in Africa within three to six months, though experts say that the death toll could be lower if authorities can move swiftly to contain outbreaks of the disease.\n\u201cWe are at the beginning in Africa,\u201d Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO\u2019s health emergencies programme, said last week.\nSouth and Central America, by contrast, are already deep in crisis, with Brazil emerging as a significant epidemic hotspot. Cases of Covid-19 are overwhelming hospitals, morgues and cemeteries, even as President Jair Bolsonaro insists it is a relatively minor disease.\nOther developments around the world include:\nRussia reported 6,361 new cases of coronavirus on Sunday, pushing its national tally above 80,000.\nThe daily death toll in Iran, the worst-hit country in the Middle East, has fallen to its lowest level in weeks. Officials said there were 60 deaths from coronavirus in the past 24 hours, down from an average of about 90 over the past 10 days.\nIn the UK, the death toll at hospitals also appeared to show a slowdown, with an increase of 413 in the last 24 hours, the lowest daily rise since the end of March.\nState media in Saudi Arabia are reporting that the curfew there will be partially lifted for all regions starting on Sunday, but that a 24-hour curfew will be maintained in Mecca. Certain economic and commercial activities, including retail stores, will reopen during Ramadan, from 29 April to 13 May.\nIndia\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, urged the country\u2019s 1.3 billion citizens to strictly comply to a nationwide lockdown as the number of confirmed cases increased steadily despite the month-long curfew.",

        "content": "Experiment aims to understand how iron-age brochs developed and what they signified\nStone upon stone, the towering embodiment of their builders\u2019 wealth, status or hunger for defence, Scotland\u2019s iron-age brochs have fascinated and confounded archaeologists for centuries.\nThe precise constitution of these architecturally complex roundhouses, and why they remain unique to Scotland, is the subject of ongoing research, but there is broad agreement that a broch is a drystone tower built between around 2,500 and 1,800 years ago, in the mid-iron age, often with cells and stairs built within the walls.\nAccording to Historic Environment Scotland (HES), between 500 and 600 have been identified using this definition, scattered across the country but with the densest distribution in Orkney, Shetland, and Caithness.\nOn the Caithness coastline, north-east of Helmsdale, conservation work on the broch at Ousdale \u2013 now among the best preserved in the country and one of the few with evidence of a second floor \u2013 was weeks away from completion when it was abruptly halted by the lockdown.\nWith fresh gravel flooring ready to lay when restrictions allow, the Caithness Broch Project, which coordinated the \u00a3180,000 Ousdale preservation, will then be ready to proceed with its flagship experiment: building a new broch from the ground up for the first time in the modern age, with the aim of understanding through construction how these structures developed and what they signified to the people who built them.\n\u201cExperimental archaeology is a more practical and innovative way of dealing with the difficult questions posed by these enigmatic constructions,\u201d explains Kenneth McElroy, the director of the Caithness Broch Project. \u201cIn turn, this helps us to better understand peoples of Scotland, and what drove them to build such impressive constructions.\u201d\nA handful of the most impressive brochs \u2013 Gurness, dominating the shoreline of Eynhallow Sound in Orkney, or the 13-metre Mousa broch in Shetland, which features in two Norse sagas \u2013 are open to the public. Many are cared for by HES or local authorities, but still more are lost beneath grassy tors, evidenced only by a few protruding stones.\nDr John Raven, the deputy head of casework at HES, suggests that a series of factors combined to create the context for the development of brochs. \u201cIn the background is a social crisis throughout north-western Europe in the mid-iron age which resulted the creation of hierarchies who sought to express their status and ownership by building complex structures. This was also a period of climate change which resulted in a significant expansion of peat growth in north and west Scotland, which limited the extent of good agricultural land and placed pressure on communities.\n\u201cIt is also possible that communities were reacting to slave trading with communities to the south and later the knock-on effects of the expansion of Rome. The structural complexity of brochs also suggests the development of specialised building techniques which largely limited the spread to inter-connected communities.\u201d\nAs well as a thrilling exercise in experimental archaeology, the construction of a new broch will preserve and promote the skills of drystone dyking, says McElroy. He is working with a firm of architects to identify a suitable site for the project before fundraising stars in earnest. Crucially, he adds, the newbuild broch could serve as a world-class tourist attraction to draw visitors to Caithness, an area often bypassed on the way to more familiar island destinations.\nMcElroy says: \u201cThere are so many unanswerable questions in archaeology, and in the past, but this should go some way to revealing more about our iron-age ancestors.\u201d",

        "content": "My father, Wilfred Beckerman, who has died aged 94, was a renowned economist who combined a distinguished academic career, primarily as fellow of Balliol College, Oxford, with equally influential periods as an economic adviser for government. He was highly active (skiing into his 80s), a twinkly-eyed man with a good sense of humour whose love of learning and intellectual debate never left him.\nBorn in London, the fifth of six children of poor Jewish immigrant parents, Moishe, a tailor, and Mattl, a seamstress, he left school at 15 but continued to study in his spare time. In 1943, aged 18, he joined the Royal Navy and quickly rose to officer rank. Having persuaded the LSE to let him briefly study there before joining up, despite not having the required academic qualifications, he was then eligible for the government\u2019s scheme to allow ex-servicemen to complete their tertiary education free after the war had ended.\nOnce demobbed in 1946, he donned his officer\u2019s uniform and armed with only chutzpah and any documents that might impress college authorities, he walked along King\u2019s Parade, Cambridge, going into college after college, asking if they might allow him to study economics there. The first few said \u201cno\u201d but eventually, Trinity College said yes. \u201cLuck,\u201d Wilfred always said, \u201cplays such a big part in life.\u201d\nIn 1952, he joined the OECD (the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) in Paris, and in the same year married Nicole Ritter. They went on to have three children, Stephen, Sophia and me. At the OECD he rose to be head of division, developing his interests primarily in welfare economics. In 1964, he was appointed fellow of Balliol College, Oxford, although from 1967 he also worked as economic adviser to the president of the Board of Trade, Anthony Crosland, a post which placed him at the heart of the economic policies of the Wilson government.\nIn 1969, he became professor and head of the department of political economy at UCL and, whilst there, was a key adviser on the first Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution.\nHe returned to Balliol in 1975, and continued to teach there until mandatory retirement, aged 67. Among the many pupils who came to him for weekly tutorials were Yvette Cooper, Seumas Milne, Matthew Syed and Stephanie Flanders.\nAfter Oxford, he continued to write books and taught a highly popular course at UCL. His last lecture was delivered six weeks before his death.\nNicole died in 1979 and my father married Joanna Pasek in 1991. She survives him, as do their daughter, Beatrice, Joanna\u2019s daughter, Agnieszka, and Stephen, Sophia and me.",

In the short term, we have to do a really major catch-up exercise to stop this backlog causing harm,\u201d Prof Derek Alderson, the president of the Royal College of Surgeons in England, told the Sunday People.\nOperations for hip and knee replacements, cataracts and hernias have all been delayed to make beds available to cope with coronavirus cases. Outpatient procedures are also on hold.\nThe disruption to operations will have consequences for scores of patients, ranging from those with cancer, whose tumours may grow while they are waiting for surgery, to those who are less able to exercise and become unfit in the run-up to physically demanding operations.\n\u201cThe consequences are really serious,\u201d Alderson said. \u201cThere are some patients who have cancers that are usually slow-growing but this may impact on long-term survival. A patient\u2019s condition may deteriorate so they are no longer fit for the operation. Someone may be waiting for a hip replacement and may not be able to exercise and become even less fit for surgery. They may become addicted to opiates to manage their pain. Then there are all the mental health consequences.\u201d\nThe warning follows concerns raised by Cancer Research UK that the number of patients with suspected cancer who are being referred to hospital specialists has fallen dramatically. The charity believes more than 2,000 cancers are being missed each week and that many will become inoperable if they remain undetected. As estimated 400 cancers a week are being missed because normal screening programmes for breast, cervical and bowel cancer have been suspended.\nAn NHS spokesperson said: \u201cWhile NHS staff have pulled out all the stops to manage coronavirus cases, they have continued to work hard to ensure patients can safely access services.\n\u201cNext week we will set out new guidance on redeploying some of the treatment capacity that was created while the number of Covid-19 patients rose sharply. A public information campaign is reminding people the NHS remains open for business. It is important that non-Covid-19 patients can still safely access care and treatment.\u201d",

        "content": "Prime minister expected to press EU leaders to dedicate attention to faltering negotiations\nBoris Johnson is expected to push for an intervention from EU leaders in the faltering trade and security negotiations with the bloc after being warned by advisers that the current talks are on course to fail.\nThere is recognition on both sides of the talks that there is little prospect of agreement on the most contentious issues without a major reset of positions.\nWith the prime minister set to return to Downing Street on Monday, Johnson is expected to press the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and EU nation governments to dedicate attention to the negotiation with the British government.\nSources suggested that there would need to be a rethink over the next fortnight in order to rescue the negotiation. The UK will leave the single market and customs union at the end of 2020, after which tariffs will be applied to the trade in goods unless there is a deal agreed.\nBoth sides have said they need to see progress by June, with Downing Street warning that they may need to walk away from the talks at that point to prepare solely for a no-deal outcome.\nThere are just two scheduled rounds of video-conference talks, and senior sources on both sides said these were not likely to deliver a deal, due to principled differences as well as the difficulties presented by the technology.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t see all the faces of the people around the table; you don\u2019t see the body language, you cannot have discussion in the margins\u201d, an EU official said. \u201cBut having said that, this is how we are working now; we need to make the best of it.\u201d\nThe EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and his British counterpart, David Frost, came out fighting from last week\u2019s round of talks on the future relationship, only the second since the UK left the EU on 31 January.\nBarnier accused the UK of not engaging with key issues of particular importance to the EU, including access to British waters for European fishing fleet and the so-called level playing field conditions to ensure neither side can undercut environmental, labour and social standards.\nEU sources added that UK officials \u201clistened politely\u201d to their proposals but did not seek to negotiate on them. \u201cI regret it, and this worries me\u201d, Barnier told reporters at a press conference at the end of last week\u2019s talks.\nThe British negotiating team has rejected the claim, instead questioning the value of the deal being proposed by Brussels, which would tie the UK to EU regulations while also constructing significant non-tariff barriers on trade.\nWhitehall sources said there was a difference between not engaging and simply disagreeing with the EU approach. There is a particular frustration on the UK side that the EU has rejected proposals to remove unnecessary technical barriers to trade, including some sanitary and phytosanitary checks on animal products, despite British commitments to maintain high standards and there being precedent in previous trade deals.\nOn security cooperation, the UK has argued in the negotiating room that the EU\u2019s offer is based on existing deals but comes with unprecedented obligations, including a direct role for the European court of justice in dispute settlements: a red line for Downing Street.\nTwo areas in which there have been better talks are civil nuclear cooperation and UK involvement in EU programmes. \u201cThe UK has expressed interest in participating in [the research and science programme] Horizon, for example\u201d, said an EU official. \u201cSo there\u2019s certainly some useful discussions ongoing in this area.\u201d\nHowever, there is growing concern about the UK\u2019s implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol in the withdrawal agreement, which was designed to avoid a border on the island of Ireland.\nThe protocol requires checks on goods passing from Britain to Northern Ireland. \u201cYou need to have customs checks on goods arriving in Northern Ireland, veterinary controls, a VAT system needs to be put in place\u201d, said an EU official.\nThe two sides are expected to have a stock check on 30 April at the next meeting of the joint committee, the body established to ensure implementation of the provisions in the withdrawal agreement.\nFrost has ruled out an extension of the transition period. The UK believes there is ample time to agree and ratify a free-trade deal if the EU changes its position.",

        "content": "The PM is back at work on Monday, with tough decisions to be made\nPressure has been mounting from backbench Conservative MPs \u2013 and some cabinet ministers \u2013 for elements of the stringent distancing rules imposed on 23 March to be lifted.\nWhitehall has been working on options \u2013 \u201cdoing the homework\u201d, as Johnson\u2019s deputy, Dominic Raab, put it on Sunday \u2013 but ministers have been reluctant to make any decisions without the prime minister.\nThe health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, is determined that the transmission rate of the virus \u2013 the R0, as it is known \u2013 be suppressed well below 1 before the lockdown is eased. He is also racing to get a track-and-trace system up and running to help control the virus when restrictions are eased.\nMeanwhile, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who unlike Hancock was present at a three-hour meeting in Chequers on Friday, is known to be keen to allow some businesses to reopen, given the catastrophic impact of a total shutdown on the economy.\nThere are also growing anxieties over the impact of an extended lockdown on mental and physical health, domestic abuse and the welfare of vulnerable children.\nJohnson will have to make the ultimate decision about how to balance these and other concerns, with a formal review of the measures due by 7 May.\nMatt Hancock\u2019s self-imposed deadline of completing 100,000 tests a day by the end of April expires this week.\nCapacity has ramped up significantly in recent days, with all key workers now able to apply for a test \u2013 but self-administered testing kits have been running out within minutes on the government\u2019s website, and workers have complained that they cannot book a test slot anywhere locally.\nThe government announced at the weekend that the army will now be involved in setting up mobile testing units.\nHancock has insisted his goal remains achievable \u2013 but it looks a stretch, and some colleagues feel it was always a hostage to fortune.\nJohnson will have to choose whether to maintain No 10\u2019s staunch backing of Hancock, or to distance himself from the pledge (though the prime minister himself suggested 250,000 tests a day would be achievable).\nHe will also have to decide how much of the government\u2019s effort should be focused on the tracking-and-testing approach Hancock now regards as crucial.\nJohnson will have to decide whether the decision-making structure in place through the peak of the crisis remains the right one for managing its next phase.\nIn his absence, key decisions have been made by a \u201cquad\u201d of ministers: Sunak, Hancock, Raab and the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, each of whom chair one of the four powerful Covid-19 committees that have been managing the government\u2019s day-to-day response.\nAt key turning points, decisions have also been rubber-stamped by the Cobra emergency committee, which includes representatives of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London, as well as ministers and experts.\nIn turn, Cobra receives advice from the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage). The government has repeatedly insisted its approach has been \u201cled by the science\u201d, but the independence of Sage has been thrown into doubt by the revelation that Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, has been attending its meetings, to the disquiet of some members.\nThe prime minister will have to decide whether Cummings should continue to attend and more broadly, which stakeholders should be included in decision-making from now on.\nSome Tory MPs would like to see the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, bound in to deliberations about lifting lockdown, for example \u2013 and as parts of the economy reopen, the TUC have called for the formation of a national council for reconstruction and recovery, including unions and employers as well as government.\nKeir Starmer confronted Raab at his first prime minister\u2019s questions as Labour leader in a largely empty House of Commons chamber last Wednesday.\nThis week, it will be Johnson who has to face an interrogation, without the usual supportive roar from Tory backbenchers. It comes amid mounting questions about whether the prime minister was slow to react to the crisis at the start of the year: including whether he was right to allow Hancock to lead five early Cobra meetings on the virus.\nA series of early decisions have been challenged, including halting the tracing of cases, allowing mass events such as the Cheltenham Festival to go ahead, and failing to act quickly enough to secure supplies of PPE.\nStarmer made clear in a letter to the prime minister this weekend he will try to make some of this criticism stick \u2013 and will continue to press for more details on the government\u2019s planned exit strategy.\n\u201cI fear we are falling behind the rest of the world,\u201d the Labour leader wrote, urging Johnson to promise that no one will have to travel more than 20 minutes to have themselves tested for the virus.\nThe latest round of the (physically distanced) Brexit talks ended on Friday, with both sides blaming the other for the lack of progress.\nThe government is accusing the EU of treating the UK more harshly than other counterparts in recent trade deals, while the EU fears ministers are backsliding on aspects of the Brexit deal struck last October.\nBoris Johnson is expected to ask the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and EU leaders to intervene in the negotiations in the hope of breaking the deadlock.\nThe government must decide in June whether to seek an extension to the status quo transition period, something ministers have repeatedly insisted they are determined not to do.\nOnly two more rounds of videoconference negotiations are currently scheduled, but Johnson may hope that his personal involvement could help, as it did last autumn.\nGove is likely to reveal more about the government\u2019s thinking when he appears before the House of Commons EU future relationship committee on Monday.\nThe Whitehall ethics adviser Alex Allan has reportedly completed his investigation into events surrounding the resignation of the former Home Office permanent secretary Sir Philip Rutnam, who accused Priti Patel of bullying \u2013 but it was set aside in the prime minister\u2019s absence.\nRutnam resigned on 29 February, claiming he had been \u201cthe target of a vicious and orchestrated briefing campaign\u201d .\nHe has already announced that he is taking legal action against Patel under whistleblowing laws, with the case expected to focus on her treatment of civil servants.\nThe prime minister tasked Allan with examining Patel\u2019s alleged conduct, and whether it contravened the ministerial code. Johnson has previously backed Patel, saying he is \u201csticking by her\u201d, but that could change if Allan finds she has broken the rules.",

We need to know whether he used his influence to delay UK lockdown by those few crucial weeks in March.Dr Richard MilneUniversity of Edinburgh\n Sir Patrick Vallance tells us that by not making members of Sage known to the public he was protecting the scientists from \u201clobbying and other forms of unwanted influence which may hinder their ability to give impartial advice\u201d. His change of heart about this protection is undoubtedly driven by the leaked information about the makeup of the group, as reported by the Guardian.\nHowever, possible damage may have already been done regarding \u201cunwanted influence\u201d on the group\u2019s impartiality by the participation in several meetings of two ardent Brexiter government advisers. What Sir Patrick needs to do is ensure these two characters do not attend such meetings in future.

If this proposal were to be made law, I would immediately seek to crowdfund a legal challenge on the grounds that 1) there is no power in the Public Health Act to lock down people not reasonably believed to be infectious, and 2) that this would be disproportionate to the danger, and discriminatory, and therefore contrary to the human rights convention.\nUnless one suffers from a form of dementia, age does not impair one\u2019s wits \u2013 over-70s with impaired health can be relied upon to take proper precautions. If, however, like me, they are healthy and in their right minds, they should be allowed their freedom like anyone else. There are no laws against dangerous sports, and it is many years since suicide was a criminal act.\nOne is entitled to take reasonable risks and, if necessary, I would be willing to sign a declaration waiving my rights to a hospital bed or a ventilator. I would hope that Keir Starmer, as an experienced human rights lawyer, would refuse to support this approach. For older people to be summarily deprived without good reason of precious time spent in crucial family relationships, when their days are necessarily naturally numbered, is cruel and I suspect and hope would be found illegal.Salley VickersWilcot, Wiltshire\n Gaby Hinsliff (Social distancing isn\u2019t going to end soon. So how do we live with it?, 23 April) makes the interesting observation that \u201cIf an octogenarian who has lived a long and fulfilling life would rather take their chances with Covid-19 than never see their grandchildren again, is it morally justifiable in the interests of containing the virus to keep them at home, or must we eventually seek the safest way of letting human nature express itself?\u201d\nThis raises interesting wider questions. We allow people to make plenty of unwise decisions about their health, especially in relation to what and how much they eat and drink. These decisions, while not directly affecting others, can have unpleasant or even disastrous consequences. They certainly put pressure on the NHS.\nSo might we expect to see some debate over whether we remove liberties that affect other people and society in general in the way that we have done in the current crisis, or will we treat this as something exceptional?Bob WolfsonRudford, Gloucestershire\n I take great umbrage at David Blunkett\u2019s comments against age-based restrictions in emerging from lockdown (Older people could face extended coronavirus lockdown, Lords hears, 23 April). Until a vaccine is found we have to continue to shield older people, but we also have to face our economy shrinking. Since our welfare system is largely based on income taxes, we need young people to earn and pay those very taxes upon which our pensions depend.\nThe young have been the heroes in lockdown. They have stalled their futures to help protect older relatives. They have lost jobs, homes, incomes and education. They have volunteered, delivered food, and stocked shelves to feed the nation. The young have proved themselves to be the packhorse heroes of the pandemic and the least old-age lobby groups can do is support young people\u2019s exit from lockdown to get the economy going.Ashley SeagerCo-founder, Intergenerational Foundation \n Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters\n Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

And while I understand that the finer details are still being sketched out by a cross-sport working group, the broader brushstrokes \u2013 restarting the Premier League, horse racing and cricket behind closed doors, with frequent testing for Covid-19 and appropriate physical distancing measures in place \u2013 have been teased and trailed for weeks.\nWhatever happens next in these discombobulating times it is probably safe to assume that the Premier League will emerge relatively unscathed. True, players might end up a touch less remunerated. And, yes, transfer fees and TV rights will come down. But when the circus cranks up again, it will still be swimming in money and attention. It\u2019s the rest of sport that we should be worried about. Because right now the darkest economic cloud in our lifetime is fast looming into view, and I am not sure we have grasped the potential consequences for sport \u2013 and for us.\nAcademics have long noted \u201cthe recession effect\u201d whereby sporting activity among the public falls during times of economic downturn because people are less able to pay for team sports or gym membership \u2013 or are worried simply about keeping their heads above water financially. But when I spoke to a leading figure in sport this weekend, they warned of a \u201cgrave danger\u201d that much of the infrastructure that enables us to do sport might not survive for the 18 months it might take for a vaccine to be found.\nMany leisure chains and gyms are already in serious financial trouble. This month UK Active, which represents more than 3,500 commercial gyms and community leisure centres, warned that landlords were \u201ccoercing gyms into paying rent that has been withheld as a result of Covid-19\u201d \u2013 and there was a \u201cgrowing number of cases where the reaction of landlords has been to instigate legal proceedings against operators when rent cannot be paid\u201d.\nIt\u2019s not like councils can step into the breach, either. Massive cuts to local authority budgets during the austerity years have made it difficult for them to deliver their statutory functions, such as looking after vulnerable children and pensioners, let alone provide parks, swimming pools and leisure centres. In fact in some cases it is councils which have been the most vociferous in demanding gyms continue to pay their rents.\nMeanwhile according to one recent report, more than 200 school football pitches have been sold and 700 council-owned pitches closed since 2010 \u2013 while nearly 700 publicly accessible tennis courts and 80-plus school cricket pitches have also gone. That is bad enough. But what will be the effect for kids who may be deprived of PE lessons and sport for months? All these issues are likely to have greater knock-on effects than is realised. If leisure centres go out of business, for instance, that is fewer courts for people to play badminton or netball, to swim or do senior citizens yoga when things return to normal.\nPeople may not return to their weekly class, either. We also know that habits can easily bend or break \u2013 or simply change. Do you know what the third most popular sporting activity was in the UK in 1977, after walking and swimming? It was playing snooker and pool \u2013 with 9.3% of adults in the annual Great Household Survey saying they had a game regularly. Fourth was darts with 5.8%.\nAlso in 1977 just 3.3% of respondents said they had done keep fit or yoga in the previous four weeks, with 2.7% playing football, and 1.9% cycling. Nowadays things have changed, with more of us riding bikes or going to the gym. We also have a far better understanding of how much activity helps the body and mind. But there are understandable fears that a downward spiral of an economic recession, fewer facilities and less activity could lead to the UK becoming more of a two-tiered sporting nation.\nIncidentally, I am told that any decision affecting sport will not happen in isolation. Instead it will fit in to wider plans to ease the lockdown \u2013 the key question being where sport fits in to the sequencing of removing some restrictions over the weeks and months ahead. It might be June. Perhaps later. But while I expect racing and Premier League football to be back behind closed doors before too long, the working assumption of most of the scientists and senior sportspeople I speak to is that there won\u2019t be packed stadiums again until next year.\nThat, of course, could be devastating for sports such as rugby league, athletics and basketball. The British Basketball League play-off finals at the O2 Arena, for instance, are reckoned to generate around a third of the League\u2019s income. UKA will also take a big financial hit if the Anniversary Games in July is cancelled. Across multiple sports, organisations and clubs are looking grimly at their balance sheets. Not all will survive.\nMeanwhile Sport England is already highlighting that the trend for those in lower socioeconomic groups to be less active appears to be growing during the pandemic \u2013 with research already showing that people on low incomes are finding it harder than normal to be active. Last week its chief executive, Tim Hollingsworth, urged sport to begin thinking collectively about how to sustain the nation\u2019s wellbeing after the pandemic. That is a conversation that really can\u2019t start soon enough.",

Virgin Atlantic is 51% owned by Branson\u2019s Virgin Group and 49% owned by Delta Air Lines.\nBranson\u2019s attempt to secure taxpayer money has been met with criticism from the public and politicians, who have said the billionaire should fund the airline himself. It has been pointed out that Branson has paid the exchequer no personal income tax in 14 years, since he moved to his private island in the tax-free British Virgin Islands. Branson is the UK\u2019s seventh richest person, with an estimated \u00a34.7bn fortune.\nBranson has said previously: \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots of comments about my net worth, but that is calculated on the value of Virgin businesses around the world before this crisis, not sitting as cash in a bank account ready to withdraw.\u201d\nBranson\u2019s spokesman said on Sunday: \u201cVirgin Group is providing liquidity to help support its companies and save jobs. Richard and the Virgin Group are committed to the airline and are not looking to sell Virgin Atlantic. They recognise that further investment will be necessary to make up for the total loss of revenue due to Covid-19 and are working with Houlihan Lokey to approach private investors about the investment opportunity.\u201d\nEarlier reports on Sunday said Branson had set a deadline of May to sell the airline, which he founded in 1984 and has often referred to as \u201cone of my children\u201d.\nDelta has ruled out pumping fresh funds into the airline as it faces its own cash crisis.\nVirgin Australia called in administrators last week after it failed to secure a A$1.4bn (\u00a3715m) bailout from the Australian government. That airline is 10% owned by Virgin Group.\nBranson has pledged to inject $250m (\u00a3197m) into Virgin Group, his empire which stretches from planes and trains to health clubs and spaceships, and which employs about 70,000 people. The pledge \u2013 of which $100m is thought to be earmarked for the airline \u2013 represents 5% of his fortune.\nA Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said: \u201cBecause of significant costs to our business caused by unprecedented market conditions which the Covid-19 crisis has brought with it, we are exploring all available options to obtain additional external funding. Houlihan Lokey has been appointed to assist the process, focusing on private sector funding. Meanwhile, we continue to take decisive action to reduce our costs, preserve cash and protect jobs.\u201d\nBritain\u2019s airline industry has urged the government to extend the coronavirus job retention scheme as people are expected to delay all flight for months to come.\nTim Alderslade, the chief executive of Airlines UK, asked the Treasury to provide certainty about the scheme, according to Sky News.\n\u201cWe believe that the scheme will need to be extended beyond June, and that consideration should be given to measures \u2013 including a \u2018tapering\u2019 of the scheme or a review on a sectoral basis \u2013 to avoid aviation facing a cliff-edge post-June whilst services are scaled up,\u201d he said.\n This article was amended on 27 April 2020 because Virgin Atlantic has not grounded all of its planes, as an earlier version said. It is operating some cargo-only and repatriation flights.",

Eduardo Bolsonaro, who is the South America representative of Steve Bannon\u2019s far-right group The Movement, claimed on Twitter the claims were \u201can attempt to confuse the population\u201d. He also retweeted an image of a dog defecating on the newspaper\u2019s masthead.\nJair Bolsonaro and his backers have been battling to regain control of the narrative since Moro\u2019s damaging exit, painting the former judge as a pro-choice, anti-gun traitor to their far-right cause.\nBolsonaro denied any wrongdoing in a rambling speech in which he claimed he was the victim of a political conspiracy. \u201cPowerful people have risen up against me. This is a reality. This is the truth. I\u2019m fighting against the system \u2013 against the establisher [sic],\u201d he claimed.\n\u201cWe are, in the figurative sense, going to get shot in the face loads. But we will fulfil our mission,\u201d Bolsonaro vowed.\nBut claims investigators had identified the president\u2019s son as part of the alleged fake news network \u2013 something political foes have long suspected \u2013 prompted fresh calls for the president\u2019s impeachment and reinforced growing doubts over whether the rightwing populist would complete his four-year term.\n\u201cThe government is crumbling,\u201d said Eliane Cantanh\u00eade, a political commentator for the conservative Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t bet on an impeachment \u2013 either for or against,\u201d she added, pointing to reluctance among some politicians to impeach a third president in less than three decades. \u201cBut it\u2019s also hard to imagine Bolsonaro making it through nearly three more years in the midst of this chaos. It\u2019s a real pickle.\u201d\nMarcelo Freixo, a leftwing congressman, said he would take legal action to block Ramagem\u2019s appointment.\n\u201cBolsonaro wants to control the federal police ... because he doesn\u2019t want the federal police to advance in its investigations related to his sons. There\u2019s no doubt about it,\u201d Freixo claimed. \u201cBolsonaro is protecting his children.\u201d\nThe Guardian has approached Brazil\u2019s presidential communication secretariat for comment.",

The death toll now stands at 26,644, while the number of people who have recovered has risen to 64,928.\nSpain\u2019s daily death toll dropped below 300 for the first time in weeks as it partially relaxed the lockdown. On Sunday, children aged under 14 were allowed outside to exercise for the first time since mid-March.\nThe daily rise in the death toll in the UK announced on Sunday was the lowest since the end of March. The number of deaths in UK hospitals from coronavirus rose to 20,732, an increase of 413 in the last 24 hours.\nThe daily Covid-19 death toll in New York state was markedly lower on Sunday than it was on Saturday, with officials recording 367 fatalities, compared with 437 a day earlier.\nNarendra Modi gave a radio address to urge the country\u2019s 1.3 billion citizens to strictly comply with the nationwide lockdown, as the number of confirmed cases increased steadily despite the month-long curfew.\nOfficials in Iran, the worst-hit country in the Middle East, said there were 60 deaths from the coronavirus in the past 24 hours, taking the total to 5,710.\nThe new set of regulations to improve public hygiene and combat the coronavirus include a ban on behaviour such as not covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.\nThe country reported 6,361 new cases on Sunday. Sixty-six people died with the virus in the past day, bringing the total death toll to 747, Russia\u2019s official crisis response centre said.",

Together, the courts cover all jurisdictions, except Western Australia, which operates under a different system.\nWomen\u2019s legal and domestic and family violence services have warned that the restrictions put in place to address the health pandemic have exacerbated existing issues within vulnerable families.\nA spokeswoman for the courts said it had been advised of an increase of inquiries to those services since the restrictions were put in place last month, in relation to Covid-19 and parenting matters.\nThe chief justice the courts, Will Alstergren, said the new list had been created to better identify those urgent cases.\n\u201cApplications that are eligible to be dealt with through the Covid-19 List, especially those involving issues of risk and family violence, will receive immediate attention and will be triaged by a dedicated registrar who will assess the needs of the case and allocate it to be heard by a judge within 72 hours of being assessed,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt is important that these urgent Covid-19 applications are closely managed on a national basis so that they can be heard as swiftly as possible given the unprecedented circumstances we are facing.\n\u201cI would also like the public to know that if they need to file an urgent application because they have been directly impacted by Covid-19, it will be heard electronically as quickly as possible by a judge from any registry of the courts.\u201d\nThe jurist said court staff had been working to have applications heard as quickly as possible, simplifying the process to deal with cases via electronic means, which means parties can file their applications through email and attend the hearing through a teleconference.\nThe new arrangements will remain in place for at least three months.\n If you or someone you know is impacted by sexual assault, domestic or family violence, call 1800RESPECT on 1800 737 732 or visit 1800RESPECT.org.au.",

        "content": "Voting starts as Bill Beaumont and Agust\u00edn Pichot battle to control World Rugby, and their backstories are just as contrasting as their visions for the sport\nSo concludes the election campaign to be World Rugby\u2019s top dog. Voting has begun, though we will not know for sure whether Bill Beaumont or Agust\u00edn Pichot has prevailed for more than two weeks. There are, of course, mitigating circumstances but, as convoluted processes go, you might have thought lessons would be learned from the contest to host the 2023 World Cup (more on that later).\nIt may yet prove to be the smoothest of ballots, but a fortnight is a long time in sports politics. That the vote is secret and heavily weighted so that the Six Nations countries each get three votes, Fiji or the USA one, serves only to muddy the waters further.\nOn to the candidates and Beaumont has had a trying couple of weeks, what with his campaign being backed by a convicted killer who has been condemned by Amnesty International. The Fiji rugby union chairman, Francis Kean, has been denied a visa for the US but astonishingly he emerged as a key supporter of Beaumont\u2019s bid. It is just one of this campaign\u2019s great ironies that a key part of Sir Bill\u2019s manifesto is a fit and proper persons test for elected officials.\nTo briefly recap, Beaumont has been nominated by France and seconded by Fiji. In turn, Bernard Laporte, who is running unopposed as his vice-chairman, has been nominated by the Rugby Football Union while Kean was seconded by France for a role on World Rugby\u2019s executive committee. This was all announced nearly two weeks ago but then fresh allegations of homophobia by Kean came to light and Beaumont had to act, with Fiji pressured to stand down Kean from the World Rugby council and the election. Meanwhile, Fiji\u2019s vote falls to Frank Bainimarama, the president of the union and who happens to be Kean\u2019s brother-in-law and his country\u2019s prime minister. Bainimarama, lest we forget, took charge of the country in 2006 via military coup.\nIt is against this backdrop that Beaumont has also had to deal with the white knight in white trainers coming up the rails. Pichot has portrayed himself as the underdog but he has gathered late momentum. For this is an election fought on the north-south divide, the traditionalist Beaumont against the revolutionary Pichot, the dinosaur versus the dynamo. Accordingly, Beaumont has undergone a bit of a rebrand, trying to come across as a bit more avuncular. Pichot has called for a new rugby computer game to spin the world game on its axis, Beaumont insists: \u201cI\u2019m not bad with modern technology.\u201d You get the gist.\nWhile Beaumont has the backing of the European stronghold, Pichot has the Sanzaar votes and has been canvassing for the support of the tier two nations. This new radical wants to shake up the existing order. Indeed, Pichot wants to spread the British & Irish Lions gospel in the Americas. That\u2019s Argentina\u2019s Pichot, who was appointed to the USA Rugby board in late 2018.\nThere is also the matter of the 2027 World Cup. Argentina had been expected to bid but Pichot recently revealed that was no longer the case and instead the union would be getting behind Australia. Pichot\u2019s nomination in the election was seconded by Rugby Australia. It is only a couple of years ago that RA was furious to learn of his relationship with the Australian iron ore billionaire Andrew \u2018Twiggy\u2019 Forrest \u2013 the brains behind the rebel World Series Rugby competition.\nIndeed, eyebrows were raised when he appointed Pichot, not previously famous for being an expert in the field, as head of his South American mining operation. So much so that one of RA\u2019s leading officials, Brett Robinson, reportedly demanded that Pichot declare his conflict of interest to World Rugby. It seems the pair have made up, however, because Robinson\u2019s nomination to World Rugby\u2019s executive committee was seconded by the Argentinian union.\nBeaumont and Pichot have spent the past four years as chairman and vice-chairman respectively, but this election battle has long since been coming. According to one well-placed source, they were \u201cwatching each other\u2019s every move\u201d throughout the Japan World Cup and their manifestos do not differ greatly from each other. But while Pichot has decided to go it alone, Beaumont has enlisted Laporte\u2019s services. And Laporte is a political animal.\nIt was he who, despite an official recommendation that South Africa should be awarded the 2023 World Cup, convinced the voters to plump for France. It seems likely Laporte fancies a crack at the top job, a year after delivering that tournament, and while that 2023 fiasco came at great embarrassment to Beaumont, clearly he recognised the Frenchman\u2019s influence. Indeed, it was Laporte who almost convinced the uber-conservative Six Nations to back the Nations Championship proposal.\nHaving Laporte as his No 2 has not been without its difficulties, however. There is his role in the Kean affair and Beaumont was also forced to row back on Laporte\u2019s recent claims that World Rugby would run a proposed Club World Cup and the Champions Cup would be ditched as a result. It is unlikely that was a slip of the tongue by Laporte who, crucially, understands the balance of power within the global game and just how much of it lies with the clubs in England and France.\nWe have heard plenty about a new-found cooperation between unions and clubs in recent weeks, but already the cracks are beginning to show. World Rugby wants to play Tests in October, the European clubs have balked at the idea. The best way to interpret Laporte\u2019s comments is as planting a flag, the Frenchman aware that the coronavirus crisis has rendered the clubs weaker than usual. Because, for all that Beaumont and Pichot have both promised change, it will only happen with the say-so of the clubs, regardless of whoever accrues most votes on 12 May.",

Sleeping in his own bed, cooking his own food, watching his own television; the happiness in recovering these simple freedoms has been profound, even if he cannot stop his mind drifting to an experience that will never leave him. \u201cThis is a year I\u2019ll never forget,\u201d he tells the Guardian. \u201cA very, very strange moment. Many things have happened to me that I will never forget in my life.\u201d\nIt is hard to know where to start given that, until 18 April, Kouassi and his teammates had spent 104 days away from Wuhan. The end of their involuntary exile was facilitated after the city\u2019s Covid-19 lockdown was lifted on 8 April, and they eventually returned to a rapturous welcome from several hundred supporters at the local railway station. \u201cAt this moment, I felt as if I was in the stadium again,\u201d says Kouassi. Flickers of light appeared behind the eyes of a squad whose morale had long since hollowed.\nWuhan Zall had been in pre\u2011season training 520 miles away in Guangzhou when their home city, by then established as the origin of the Covid-19 outbreak, was put under quarantine on 23 January. It meant none of their players could return to visit family or friends before flying to M\u00e1laga and beginning a pre-season camp in the Costa del Sol six days later. They had been expected to travel back from Spain in mid-February \u2013 in time for the new Chinese Super League campaign \u2013 but that was postponed and, with nowhere to go, their stay was extended by a month.\nThe problem was that, as fears took hold in Europe, the name of Wuhan carried an inescapable stigma upon arrival. Their original hotel booking was cancelled and interaction with those outside the complex into which they eventually settled was, on a personal or professional level, sometimes impossible. \u201cIt was difficult in Spain, very difficult,\u201d Kouassi says. \u201cWe had to wear club uniform when we went out, so it was obvious who we were and people looked at us very differently. Particularly the Chinese players, who had some bad experiences in supermarkets.\n\u201cIt was hard for the coaching staff too. We trained, but nobody would play friendly games with us. Every week we wanted to play against someone, but couldn\u2019t find an opponent. It meant the coach\u2019s plans kept changing and he constantly had to think differently. And it affected the team because we were just training, one day, two days, three days. Everyone needs a bit of variety but instead it was all the same.\u201d\nIf it was a test of strength for Zall\u2019s five foreign players and their Spanish coach, Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez, the weight upon the majority of the side was almost impossible to bear. Most of their Chinese players came from the Wuhan area and, in any case, the virus was spreading in other areas of the country too. The worry was too much and meant training sessions, conducted under a cloud nobody could shift, were often truncated.\n\u201cThe atmosphere was very, very bad,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen we were training you could see the Chinese players didn\u2019t want to be out there. They were very nervous and everything felt really strange. Every day news would come through from Wuhan and it was often bad; maybe someone would hear one of their relatives was sick. It was hard to play football so the coach tried to make the sessions shorter. We tried to keep ourselves happy, and every week we\u2019d get a day off for some free time outside. But it was very tough, and especially for the Chinese guys.\u201d\nKouassi describes how happy he felt for his teammates, much more than for himself, when their high-speed train pulled into Wuhan. Many were met by their families and that could not have seemed a more remote prospect when they were told to bed down for a longer spell in Europe. Kouassi was able to briefly visit family in Ivory Coast as training fizzled to a halt, but he was called back on 14 March. Spain was by now also in the grip of coronavirus and, to considerable relief, a return to China was deemed the safest course of action.\nYet there were still hurdles to confront and, for Kouassi, what followed was the bleakest period of all. The Zall squad flew to Shenzhen, adjacent to Hong Kong, and were immediately quarantined for a fortnight. Over that period he saw nothing but the bare walls of a hotel room. \u201cAhhhh \u2026 I call it a jail,\u201d he says, gasping as he recalls the stifling boredom. \u201cIt was like being in jail. The quarantine was very difficult; one of those moments that will always stay with me. We could not go out for 14 days and it was so hard.\u201d\nHe would do push\u2011ups and abdominal exercises but that, he admits, was about it in terms of physical activity or entertainment. It seemed to drag on forever, but the quarantine had its desired effect and Zall were cleared to recommence their pre-season campaign with a further camp near Guangzhou. They were then finally allowed to return home and, on Wednesday, trained in Wuhan for the first time since December.\n\u201cWe\u2019re given a blood test before training every day,\u201d Kouassi says. \u201cIt\u2019s very fast and everything is OK. I don\u2019t feel Covid-19 affects our daily lives as footballers at the moment. If we respect the things we are asked to do, like wearing a mask when we go out and just travelling between home and training, everything can be all right.\u201d\nHe describes a city that, in his words, is \u201cnot like before\u201d but shows signs of returning to normality. Shops and restaurants are opening again; the streets are hardly teeming but, while the long-term ramifications remain uncertain, he sees more residents going about their normal business with each passing day. Like others in Wuhan, Kouassi has downloaded an app that scans a \u201cgreen code\u201d when entering a premises or using public transport, only allowing entry if the user is free of Covid-19 symptoms or recent contact with an infected person. \u201cWhen we were away we heard a lot of things. But now we can see life is starting to be OK.\u201d\nIt may only seem complete to Kouassi, a 25-year-old winger who has scored 34 goals in 72 appearances since joining the club in 2017, when he can play football again. Nobody knows when that will be, although a resumption has been mooted for June or July.\n\u201cFirst I just hope everything becomes normal in the world, not only in China.\u201d He has seen, across three continents, how 2020 has been anything but ordinary.",

Health and safety measures, including Covid-19 immunity certificates, will be high on the agenda. The possibility of passengers being subject to temperature checks and pre-flight blood tests is also likely to be raised.\n\u201cI will be pushing for agreement on a common set of [EU] rules,\u201d Theoharis told the Guardian. \u201cWe need them if we are to start moving people from one country to another by road, air or sea. Temporary rules that will have to make economic sense. If, for example, you can only fly with 10 people on a plane to be deemed safe then obviously there will be no flight,\u201d he said.\nGlobal tourism has been among the hardest hit industries by the public health emergency, impacting the lives of some 75 million people employed in an industry brought to a near standstill by travel bans and closed borders. In Greece, where tourism accounts for 20% of GDP and provides one in five jobs, the economy is expected to suffer an immense blow \u2013 contracting by as much as 10% - just as it was emerging from its worst crisis in recent times.\nTheoharis, who assumed the post last July when the centre-right government was catapulted into office, predicts the country could have \u201cless than a third\u201d of the tourists it hosted last year.\nIn 2019, Greece attracted a record 33 million arrivals, more than three times its total population, and double the number it lured a decade ago. The boom brought in an unprecedented \u20ac18.2bn \u2013 revenue that played a crucial role in reviving an economy thrown into depression by a near-decade long public debt crisis that cut output by a quarter.\nOn the back of mass cancellations, the Hellenic chamber of hotels forecasts that 65% of its members could be forced to declare bankruptcy. Christina Tetradis, who runs a resort on the Ionian isle of Zakynthos and is the chamber\u2019s vice-president, says any desire to resurrect tourism is also tempered by concerns over keeping Greece virus-free. Industry figures, she says, are acutely aware of the dangers inherent in removing travel restrictions too fast. \u201cNo one wants to blamed for putting staff at risk or endangering lives.\u201d\nBut, like Theoharis, she is also persuaded that Athens\u2019 handling of the pandemic will reap rewards.\nIn contrast to other European countries, Greece, which is poised to ease lockdown measures with the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, addressing the nation on Tuesday, applied tough restrictions to contain coronavirus early on.\n\u201cWhen health and security are so important for travellers worldwide, the way the government has managed to keep the numbers down does, I think, give us a competitive edge,\u201d said Tetradis. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be complicated especially for bigger hotels. There are so many questions, like how many people can you have in a pool, are buffets out and what if someone falls sick? But there is also a sense of safety regarding coronavirus that we can project too.\u201d\nWith 2,517 confirmed cases of the disease and a death toll of 134, Greece has to date fared far better on the Covid-19 battlefront than expected.\nTurkey to its east and Italy to its west have suffered hugely, by Sunday registering mortality rates of 2,706 and 26,386 respectively.\nReimagining travel will be as paramount to tourism\u2019s survival as the precautions needed to prevent possible infections, say officials. After the 9/11  terror attacks in 2001 the sector took three years to recover but rose dramatically when it rebounded.\nTheoharis acknowledges that the future is fraught with uncertainty. Already, fears abound of a second wave of the epidemic later this year and, ultimately, much will depend on the discovery of a vaccine.\nBut if the warm weather brings a reprieve, as epidemiologists hope, Greece, he says, could open to holidaymakers in July \u2013 later than usual but in time for the peak summer months when most revenue is made.\nSelective tourism is not ruled out: traditional markets in the UK, Germany and France, may be replaced by tourists from eastern and central Europe used to accessing the country by car if air links continue to be suspended.\n\u201cOnce measures are relaxed a good month will be required to prepare the ground for the [tourism] engine to get started,\u201d he said. \u201cTour operators are waiting and hoping we can come up with the right rules so that we can start bringing visitors in. We have to strike the right balance \u2026 be cautious, tough it out and make the best of it.\u201d",

Brady, who led the Pats to six Super Bowl titles, signed with Tampa Bay last month.\n\u201cThe bottom line is that we\u2019re evaluating that position along with all the other ones,\u201d Belichick told reporters Saturday. \u201cIf we feel like we find the right situation, we\u2019ll certainly draft them.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve drafted [quarterbacks] in multiple years, multiple points in the draft,\u201d Belichick added. \u201cDidn\u2019t work out last three days. That wasn\u2019t by design. It could have, but it didn\u2019t.\u201d\nESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter has reported that the Patriots will sign Brian Lewerke, an undrafted quarterback from Michigan State, in free agency. Belichick\u2019s current starting options are Stidham, a fourth-round pick in 2019, and 34-year-old Hoyer, who returned to Foxboro last month on a one-year contract.\n\u201cI like both those players,\u201d Belichick said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had Brian [Hoyer] a couple times. I think he certainly gives us a very solid level of play. We have a lot of confidence in him.\nOn second-year prospect Stidham, Belichick said: \u201cJarrett had a good year last year. He improved a lot. We\u2019ll see where that takes him. I have confidence in both players.\u201d\nLewerke passed for 3,079 yards with 17 touchdowns and 13 interceptions in 13 games for the Spartans as a 2019 senior. He is ranked first in the school\u2019s history in total offense with 9,548 yards. Stidham appeared in three games as an NFL rookie, completing two passes for 14 yards with one interception.\nThe Patriots\u2019 highest draft pick this year was safety Kyle Dugger, taken at No 37. The franchise also signed tight ends Devin Asiasi and Dalton Keene, plus three linebackers and three offensive linemen. Kicker Justin Wohrwasser, taken in the fifth round, has already attracted controversy with a tattoo, which he has denied represents a right-wing militia group.\nElsewhere, NFL teams are making free-agency moves following the completion of the draft. The New Orleans Saints have re-signed versatile quarterback Taysom Hill to a two-year, $21m contract, and are reportedly close to agreeing a surprise one-year deal with Jameis Winston, released by Tampa Bay to make way for Brady.\nThe Chicago Bears have signed Ledarius Mack, the brother of star linebacker Khalil Mack. Undrafted defensive end Ledarius collected eight sacks and led Buffalo with 12 tackles for loss in his senior year.\n\u201cWith Khalil\u2019s brother, that\u2019s definitely something that we\u2019re looking forward to,\u201d the Bears general manager, Ryan Pace, said. \u201cIt will be unique having two brothers on the same team.\u201d\nLSU tight end Thaddeus Moss, the son of Hall of Fame wide receiver Randy, will sign with Washington. The title-winning Tigers had a record 14 players drafted this year, but attention is already turning to 2021.\nClemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence has been installed as the heavy favorite to be next year\u2019s No 1 pick, ahead of fellow QBs Justin Fields (Ohio State) and D\u2019Eriq King (Miami), and Oregon offensive tackle Penei Sewell.",

        "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s coronavirus response coordinator, Dr Deborah Birx, has cautioned that social distancing measures are likely to stay in place throughout the summer, as she sought to downplay the president\u2019s dangerous suggestion that injected disinfectant and ultraviolet light could play a role in the medical treatment of Covid-19.\nBirx made a number of appearances on the Sunday morning TV news shows, where she was asked about Trump\u2019s outlandish comments made at a White House briefing on Thursday, which prompted immediate backlash from medical experts and industrial manufacturers who cited the potentially fatal outcome of such a process. Trump has falsely claimed the comments were sarcastic.\nAppearing on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, Birx was asked if she was bothered by the fallout from the president\u2019s remarks.\n\u201cIt bothers me that this is still in the news cycle, because I think we\u2019re missing the bigger pieces of what we need to be doing as an American people to continue to protect one another,\u201d Birx said. \u201cAs a scientist and a public health official and a researcher, sometimes I worry that we don\u2019t get the information to the American people that they need when we continue to bring up something that was from Thursday night.\u201d\nIn a later appearance on NBC News, Birx also responded to a suggestion from the vice-president, Mike Pence, in which he claimed that the US would \u201clargely have this coronavirus epidemic behind us\u201d by Memorial Day, on 25 May.\nBirx said that while downward trends in infections and deaths in certain locations such as Houston and Detroit \u201cgives us great hope\u201d, she said \u201csocial distancing will be with us through the summer\u201d.\nShe added that the US required a \u201cbreakthrough innovation in testing\u201d to speed up the reopening, by testing for those who have already had coronavirus but displayed little to no symptoms, in order to track the virus\u2019s spread.\nThe comments came as New York governor Andrew Cuomo said some less affected regions of the state could partially re-open when his statewide shelter in place order expires on 15 May. New York, the worst hit state in America, reported a drop in the number of deaths again on Sunday.\nMeanwhile, Georgia\u2019s governor, the Republican Brian Kemp, has partially lifted social distancing guidelines, meaning restaurants will be allowed to reopen to the public on Monday with other businesses, including gyms and salons already allowed to re-open. The order has been criticized by Democrats and Republicans because of the state\u2019s increasing infection rate and lack of testing.\nBirx\u2019s cautious wording underlined the difficulties faced by health experts working for the administration throughout the pandemic, who have attempted to balance sound scientific advice without directly contradicting haphazard and sometimes dangerous political rhetoric from political figures, including the president.\nTrump\u2019s promotion of injected disinfectant was only the latest example of reckless promotion of unfounded or potentially harmful medical advice during the pandemic. The president had previously touted an unproven antimalarial drug, hydroxychloroquine, which the FDA has now ruled cannot be used outside of clinical trials or a hospital settings because of its potential cardiac risks.\nOn Sunday, Dr Birx told CNN she had \u201cmade it clear\u201d to Trump that injected disinfectant \u201cwas not a treatment\u201d, but added the president\u2019s advocacy on the issue should be viewed as a \u201ckind of dialogue will happen\u201d between scientists and politicians.\nAlthough Trump has not specified where the idea of using injected disinfectant as a possible remedy for Covid-19 came from, the Guardian revealed on Friday that a prominent group peddling the use of bleach as a \u201cmiracle cure\u201d had written to the president earlier in the week.\nTrump had also pushed the potential use of ultraviolet light on the body as a treatment for coronavirus, pushing research by the Department of Homeland Security exploring how heat and sunlight affect the virus on surfaces. Experts have also long cautioned against the dangerous, potentially lethal side effects of UV light on the human body.\nOn Sunday, Birx also sought to distance herself from the president\u2019s suggestion, and instead cited research from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that suggested sunlight can affect the aerosolization of the virus outdoors.\nThe back-and-forth comes as senior state Republicans showed signs of being more forceful in their criticism of Trump\u2019s wild claims.\nLarry Hogan, the Republican governor of Maryland, told ABC News on Sunday that the state received \u201chundreds of calls come into our emergency hotline at our health department asking if it was right to ingest Clorox or alcohol cleaning products \u2013 whether that was going to help them fight the virus\u201d.\nThe calls forced the governor to issue a warning against doing so.\n\u201cI think when misinformation comes out or you just say something that pops in your head, it does send a wrong message,\u201d Hogan added, with reference to Trump\u2019s press conferences.\nTrump indicated over the weekend he could halt the daily press briefings that have underpinned his shambolic response to the pandemic, drawing widespread criticism for their similarity to campaign rallies rather than public health briefings.\n\u201cWhat is the purpose of having White House News Conferences when the Lamestream Media asks nothing but hostile questions, & then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately,\u201d he tweeted on Saturday at roughly the same time in the evening that the briefing would have taken place.\n\u201cThey get record ratings, & the American people get nothing but Fake News. Not worth the time & effort!\u201d\nThere were no reports of a White House briefing on Sunday by the late afternoon.",

        "content": "From schools to shops, with jobs at risk, the government must balance the interests of economy and public safety\nAs the prime minister, Boris Johnson, heads back to Downing Street, he faces calls from Labour to be clearer about how Britain might start lifting the coronavirus lockdown, now entering its fifth week. On Sunday, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, Dominic Raab, warned the outbreak remained at a \u201cdelicate and dangerous\u201d stage and said it was irresponsible to speculate about steps to modify the rules underpinning government\u2019s \u201cstay home, protect the NHS, save lives\u201d strategy.\nMore than 20,000 people have died from Covid-19 in NHS hospitals and thousands more in care homes. But there are growing concerns about the economic impact of lockdown. Gerard Lyons, Johnson\u2019s economics adviser when he was London mayor, warned on Sunday the UK could be the hardest-hit western economy if it does not unlock soon. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, also called on ministers to start talking to teachers, businesses, trade unions and town hall leaders and open \u201chonest conversations with the public about what new arrangements might look like\u201d. Unions insist worker safety must not be compromised by any changes and questions remain about public appetite for risking a new peak of contagion, but plans to modify restrictions are starting to emerge.\nOne-way systems and plastic till barriers are among strategies to be used by retailers to reopen non-food stores. The DIY retailer Homebase tested the waters by reopening 20 of its stores on Saturday while the electronics retailer Dixons Carphone said it will launch \u201czero-contact\u201d stores. Its Norwegian shops have remained open using contactless ordering and payment, prepaid pickups and increased cleaning and hygiene. This could be replicated in the UK, the firm said.\nClothes shops could reopen, but with changing rooms off limits, according to guidelines published on Sunday by the British Retail Consortium. It has recommended store managers designate different entrances and exits and send shoppers through aisles in a one-way system to limit contact. Shopper numbers should also be restricted, promotional displays pared back to give customers more space and product demonstrations avoided to deter clustering. Tills will be shielded with plastic screens, as seen in some supermarkets, and floor markings in payment queues will keep customers two metres apart.\nRaab confirmed on Sunday that people arriving at ports and airports could be quarantined for 14 days as part of emerging plans to lift Britain out of its lockdown. Officials at the Home Office, which is responsible for border security, and the Department for Transport are reported to have drafted plans for 14-day \u201cstay at home\u201d notices, similar to those currently issued to Singaporean citizens returning from abroad. Such a rule would apply to foreign arrivals as well as UK citizens, with fines for failure to remain at the address given for isolation. Raab told the BBC\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show: \u201cWhether it is a quarantine period, or testing or other measures that might be taken, it is possible.\u201d\nIbstock, one of Britain\u2019s biggest brick-makers, will restart production on Monday, and ministers appear keen for builders to catch up on time lost during the lockdown. Construction sites have been kept open since the 23 March lockdown, with physical distancing rules in place. Due to sickness and self-isolation, however, many contracts are well behind. Two of the UK\u2019s biggest housebuilders, Persimmon and Vistry (formerly Bovid) are due to reopen sites on Monday, with Persimmon\u2019s chief executive, David Jenkinson, saying the firm has \u201cnew site protocols that incorporate the necessary social distancing and protective measures\u201d.\nBuilders could be allowed to work through evenings and weekends, in temporary lifting of noise abatement rules, it was reported at the weekend. Planning conditions currently limit how late builders can work and tend to prohibit Sunday working.\nAfter the deaths of taxi drivers, care workers, nurses and doctors from Covid-19 picked up at work, trade unions are demanding that all employers produce risk assessments before lockdown is eased. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) said that two in five workers are concerned about not being able to phyiscally distance from colleagues, and more than a quarter are concerned about not being able to physically distance from customers or clients. Building workers organised by Unite said that because workers on housebuilding sites are mostly self-employed, enforcing health and safety guidelines will be difficult.\n\u201cWe need tough new measures from government to reassure working people that their health and safety is a priority,\u201d said Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC. \u201cToo many workers have already been forced to put their health on the line during this pandemic. We all want everyone to get back to work and start rebuilding Britain. But workers need confidence that they won\u2019t have to put themselves or their families at unnecessary risk.\u201d\nThe headteachers union ASCL has said it does not think schools could reopen until 1 June at the earliest. The home secretary, Priti Patel, said at the weekend the government would not put a date on it because it would be \u201cirresponsible and get hopes up\u201d. Raab, said it would be \u201cinconceivable\u201d to send children back to school without physical distancing. This all points to schools being one of the later steps in any lockdown lifting.\nLabour is applying pressure though, with shadow cabinet member Rachel Reeves warning \u201cyoung people are missing out on vital days and weeks and months of their education\u201d. The Sutton Trust has found that two-thirds of pupils have not taken part in any online learning while at home, with independent school pupils more likely to be keeping up remotely. Social workers are concerned that the most vulnerable children will suffer most as the schools remain closed.",

Many of the areas facing the biggest job losses are in Conservative heartlands. Last week Visit Britain estimated that Covid-19 would cost the tourism industry around \u00a315bn in 2020, with 22 million fewer visitors to the UK.\n\u201cOur analysis finds a stark geographical divide in terms of how Covid-19 could impact local labour markets with rural areas and coastal towns most at risk of high job losses,\u201d said the report\u2019s authors, Fabian Wallace-Stephens and Alan Lockey. \u201cMany of the most vulnerable areas are located in the north and south-west of England. Cities and other urban areas tend to be at less risk, particularly in London or in its surrounding commuter belt.\u201d\nThe RSA found that younger workers aged 16 to 24 were more than twice as likely to be furloughed as middle-aged workers.\nA separate study, also published on Monday, says black and minority ethnic citizens will find the coming economic conditions hardest to weather because they have much less money saved to fall back on.\nThe Runnymede trust found that for every \u00a31 of wealth and savings held by white British citizens, Pakistani households have about 50p, black Caribbean households about 20p and black African and Bangladeshi households approximately 10p.\nThere is increasing evidence that black and minority ethnic people are disproportionately represented among the victims of the coronavirus, with many Asian doctors, nurses and taxi drivers among those known to have died.\n\u201cAs well as the cost in life of Covid-19, economic gaps in society are being exposed and even widened, and the effects may last for a generation, affecting ethnic minorities particularly,\u201d said Omar Khan, the director of the Runnymede Trust.\n\u201cDuring this lockdown, children are being educated at home and some adults are working from home. Many are having to dip into savings, but little consideration is given to those who have no savings to fall back on are not able to work from home and have no IT equipment or not enough space to effectively school their children.\u201d",

As such, the Item Club believes the economy should benefit later in the year from a degree of pent-up demand as people are allowed to travel again and return to the shops.\nHoward Archer, the chief economic adviser to the Item Club, said the report assumes that the government\u2019s measures aimed at supporting businesses and saving jobs would have a significant positive impact. \u201c[The support] is absolutely crucial to limiting the potential longer-term damage to the economy,\u201d he said.\nIn a separate report, the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce said one in three jobs in parts of Britain were at risk due to Covid-19.\nIt said Richmondshire in North Yorkshire \u2013 which includes chancellor Rishi Sunak\u2019s constituency \u2013 tops the list of areas likely to be most affected, with 35% of jobs vulnerable owing to the area\u2019s reliance on hospitality and tourism. Jobs in London, Oxford and Cambridge, and the London commuter belt were least at risk, it said.\nThe Item Club said GDP would fall by about 13% in the second quarter amid the widespread lockdown measures in place across Britain and in other big economies, sliding six times faster than in the deepest quarterly decline of the 2008 financial crisis. Unemployment could hit 6.8%, surging from a rate of 4% before the crisis struck.",

Urgent action is needed to protect victims and prevent perpetrators from exploiting the lockdown to increase abuse.\n\u201cThere are already alarming signs of the rise in domestic abuse. Our cross-party committee is calling for an urgent action plan from government setting out practical measures to tackle domestic abuse as an integrated part of the fight against Covid-19.\n\u201cWe are calling for new emergency funding for support services, new ways for victims to access help through supermarkets and pharmacies, outreach visits to known vulnerable households, support for children, and a new guarantee of safe housing for anyone needing to leave their home during lockdown because of abuse.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cThings are particularly hard for vulnerable children. We can\u2019t abandon them in the middle of this crisis. Local authorities, schools, the police and other professionals involved in child welfare need to ensure they are working together to contact and visit homes where children are at risk.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about supporting victims in periods of lockdown. When restrictions are eased and victims try to leave or to return to normal life, the threat to them could be even greater and the need for support will be acute. The emotional, physical and social scars from domestic abuse can last a lifetime. If we don\u2019t act to tackle it now, we will feel the consequences of rising abuse during the coronavirus crisis for many years to come.\u201d\nA pioneering project called Counting Dead Women has recorded at least 16 domestic abuse killings of women and children between 23 March, when the lockdown began, and 12 April.\nWhile the committee welcomed a public information campaign launched by the government this month, the report says ministers need to go further with a full action plan led and coordinated by the home secretary, Priti Patel.\nA cross-government strategy would need to cover support services, housing and the criminal justice system, the report says, and should extend to the period immediately after the lockdown is lifted when the need for assistance is likely to be acute.\n\u201cWithout strong action to tackle domestic abuse and support victims during the Covid-19 pandemic, society will be dealing with the devastating consequences for a generation,\u201d the report says.\nIt says the plan should include access to information and support, prevention and outreach, housing support and refuge accommodation, as well as a \u201cstrong criminal justice response\u201d.\nIn particular, it says support services for domestic abuse and vulnerable children need urgent and direct funding, otherwise victims will be put at much greater risk of harm.\nIt urges ministers to set up an emergency funding package, ringfenced within the \u00a3750m fund that the government has promised for charities dealing with the coronavirus crisis.\nThe home secretary previously announced \u00a32m of funding for domestic abuse helplines and online support, while \u00a3600,000 of funding will go to six charities that specialise in supporting victims of domestic and sexual abuse.\nThe safeguarding minister, Victoria Atkins, said: \u201cThe government has prioritised those at risk of domestic abuse in this national health emergency. This has included a dedicated national campaign to provide practical help to victims, and supporting charities by giving them the funding and the resources they specifically said they needed to help people through this crisis.\n\u201cWe are taking action across government. Alongside the #youarenotalone campaign, we are increasing funding to boost online services, helplines and technology support at the request of charities, and I am working with the domestic abuse commissioner about how they can use the government\u2019s \u00a3750m fund to further support victims.\u201d",

The were accused of taking part in anti-government protests during the Arab Spring uprisings while they were under the age of 18.\nUnited Nations human rights experts made an urgent appeal to Saudi Arabia last year to halt plans to execute them.\n\u201cThis is an important day for Saudi Arabia,\u201d said Awwad Alawwad.\n\u201cThe decree helps us in establishing a more modern penal code.\u201d\nThe reforms underscore a push by de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to modernise the ultra-conservative kingdom long associated with a fundamentalist strain of Wahhabi Islam.\nThe October 2018 murder of vocal critic Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, and the increased repression of dissidents at home, have overshadowed the prince\u2019s pledge to reform the economy and society.\nThe kingdom has one of the world\u2019s highest rates of execution, with suspects convicted of terrorism, homicide, rape, armed robbery and drug trafficking facing the death penalty.\nSaudi Arabia executed at least 187 people in 2019, according to a tally based on official data, the highest since 1995 when 195 people were put to death.\nSince January 12 people have been executed, according to official data.\nHuman rights groups have repeatedly raised concerns about the fairness of trials in the kingdom, an absolute monarchy governed under a strict form of Islamic law.\nOn Saturday, the HRC announced Saudi Arabia had effectively abolished flogging as a punishment, which have long drawn condemnation from human rights groups.\nThe most high-profile instance of flogging in recent years was the case of Saudi blogger Raif Badawi who was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes in 2014 on charges of \u201cinsulting\u201d Islam.\nBut \u201chudud\u201d or harsher punishment under Islamic law such as floggings are still applicable for serious offences, a Saudi official said.\nHudud, which means \u201cboundaries\u201d in Arabic, is meted out for such sins as rape, murder or theft. But \u201chudud\u201d punishments are rarely meted out as many offences must be proved by a confession or be verified by several adult Muslim witnesses, the official added.",

State media have carried several reports in recent days referring to statements or actions taken in Kim\u2019s name, although none has been accompanied by pictures of the leader.\nSatellite images reviewed by 38 North, a Washington-based North Korea monitoring project, showed that a train thought to belong to Kim had been parked at his compound in Wonsan for several days.\nCiting an analysis of recent satellite photos of the area, 38 North said at the weekend that the 250m-long train was not present on 15 April but was seen at the \u201cleadership station\u201d on both 21 and 23 April.\nThe site said the train appeared to have been repositioned for departure on the latter date, but added that there had been no indication of when it might leave. The station is reserved for the use of the Kim family, it added.\n\u201cThe train\u2019s presence does not prove the whereabouts of the North Korean leader or indicate anything about his health but it does lend weight to reports that Kim is staying at an elite area on the country\u2019s eastern coast,\u201d the 38 North report said.\nReporting from inside the isolated North is notoriously difficult, particularly when it comes to the regime\u2019s leadership.\nThis is not the first time Kim\u2019s absence from public life has sparked rumours about his health. He dropped out of sight in late 2014 but reappeared more than five weeks later using a walking stick. Days later, South Korea\u2019s spy agency said he had undergone surgery to remove a cyst from his ankle.",

So my food budget means I have to ration myself to eating every second day. Sometimes I\u2019ll go as long as four or five days without eating. I\u2019m very, very much looking forward to the supplement because it means for the first time in a long time I\u2019ll be able to buy fresh vegies, fresh fruit.\nIt also means so much more. I haven\u2019t bought my daughter a birthday present since 2012. She\u2019ll be 33 in June. I\u2019ll be 59. I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll buy her some art supplies \u2013 she\u2019s very artistic. She only uses the cheap stuff to experiment, but when she makes something she wants to sell, she uses the expensive stuff. As for me, there are all sorts of things I used to do that I\u2019ve forgotten because I can\u2019t afford to do them. I used to knit and crochet, but wool is expensive if you want to make anything like a jumper. I even used to dragon boat race. It\u2019s the only sport I\u2019ve loved and used to train three times a week when I had a job. I even competed nationally. Got medals and everything. But the membership costs money I didn\u2019t have, so I stopped.\nI\u2019ve been on the full independent youth allowance payment since I was 16 and became homeless. At the moment, the payment is $100 less than jobseeker, which is based on a highly outdated notion that young people are supported by their family.\nWhen the initial $750 stimulus pay came through, I used it to pay off some bills and buy some groceries. It was hard to find some things because of all the panic buying, but I was able to buy fresh food like mince and put that in the freezer, which I haven\u2019t been able to do until recently. Beforehand, skipping meals was definitely something I had to do. I still do it, but it\u2019s less of a necessity. I\u2019ve just gotten used to not eating as much.\nThe $550 fortnightly supplement basically means I can breathe easier. It means I won\u2019t be so stressed about managing every cent like I\u2019m used to. I can use it to pay off an Afterpay bill from when I replaced my jeans and shirts that had been worn past repair. Longer term, I\u2019d like to save for a better computer as my current laptop was given to me by my school years ago, and has been put through the wringer. In the very long term, I\u2019d like to save some money to visit my partner who lives in the US. That\u2019s quite expensive, so I\u2019ll hope to squirrel away some money to get me there someday.\nI\u2019ve worked part time and lived on what used to be called Newstart for around ten years. I live in a small town where there\u2019s limited chance for any kind of full-time occupation, any type of full-time paid work and because I\u2019m 65 it\u2019s hard to find a job at that age. I\u2019m lucky though, Wonthaggi is a beautiful place and I have lots of friends who help take care of each other. It\u2019s still tough at times. You get that sort of knot in the stomach when you think you\u2019ve spent too much on food that week. I suppose that big change with that temporary increase is what will lessen that feeling.\nThe moment I heard about the supplement payment, I immediately started to mentally budget on what I could spend it on. It was instant. The first thing I am going to buy is some cream cheese, some crusty bread and one of those packets of smoked salmon. That\u2019s the luxury food that you don\u2019t buy at all when you\u2019re on that tiny amount. After that are the big things like house repairs and saving for dental work. The stuff on the house you just put off for a long time. There is a leak at the back of my toilet which I\u2019m going to be getting fixed. And my chimney is pretty rusted. Get my car serviced. These are things you put off as a long as you can because no matter what you calculate one repair will lead to another. Same with teeth, really.\nRight now I\u2019m working at Dominos to support myself while I do a social work degree. I usually get $300 to $400 a week from Dominos, with Centrelink topping up my wage. Before the $750 stimulus, I was overcharging my bank account by $50. Usually we were just getting by, month-to-month.\nI\u2019ve got $300 in savings \u2013 not much for an emergency. It was tough even getting basics like veggies and fuel. I help my partner out as well. She struggles with her mental health and studies. I work so she can take care of herself.\nThe payment was announced pretty much on my birthday, so it was happy birthday from the Australian government. The money\u2019ll basically mean we\u2019re buying time. One day me and my partner would like to get married, have kids. We\u2019re thinking about moving to Melbourne one day, but we have to sort out work first, finish the degrees. Right now though we\u2019re just trying to survive, so the money means we\u2019ll be able to do that. I\u2019ll be able to cover car registration. I\u2019ll be stocking up on food a little bit \u2013 we go to the Asian grocer because no one tends to buy from there because they\u2019re worried about getting the coronavirus from Asian people. Which is stupid. Migraine medication is not on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme so that\u2019s $50 every time, which will be easier to get now. What it means is time to study. Less time to work. Time to prepare to make a big change.\nI\u2019ve variously been on what was called Newstart and the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme for nearly two years \u2013 I run an Airbnb, which gives me opportunities others don\u2019t have, though with the recent fires and now the pandemic, we\u2019re not getting any visitors.\nWhen I heard they were giving additional money, I was cynical. I was under the impression this money was only going to people who were laid off because of the virus. Change might be happening, but it\u2019s government isn\u2019t it? I did not trust that there would not be some loophole. I\u2019m still not sure if I qualify. I haven\u2019t heard from anyone directly, though I\u2019m not thinking about it. I\u2019m in survival mode.\nIt would be great if it happens. It means I can pay my friend back the thousand dollars I borrowed when I needed it. Then there\u2019s the house \u2013 there\u2019s always something that needs repairing. I can plan and organise for my small business food van to get up and running again. It\u2019ll mean I can buy bulk ingredients and because of the pandemic and social distancing rules I will need to rethink how to operate. I plan to take orders and deliver orders directly to homes.\nMy life could change, but realistically, I won\u2019t believe it until I see it. I try not to get my hopes up, because I can\u2019t risk feeling hopelessness.\nI walked to work at my part-time job this morning. A middle-aged man on a bike yelled at me because I didn\u2019t have cigarettes for him. The cops were surprised when I told them I\u2019m homeless too.\nI\u2019m so close to living in my car again. I\u2019ve got a bed this week in a $50 apartment. It\u2019s just a bed and bath with no other facilities \u2013 not even garbage collection. No cooking or laundry. At least I can lock my door and not worry about creeps staring in my car window.\nThe extra $550 a fortnight is a great relief, but it was luck the government decided to do this. I\u2019ve been kicked off the public housing list so maybe I\u2019ll use that money to get a pair of glasses so I can see and write my re-application and housing appeal? It\u2019s not enough to pay my car rego. Definitely a good pair of shoes ... some new clothes. A bit of dignity. Is that a luxury? I\u2019ll eat a little better, if I can have a fridge to store food in. My overall health will improve with the certainty of a good night\u2019s sleep. Without a home I can\u2019t get my cat back.\nWhen Covid-19 clears up, I\u2019ll get back to studying my law and criminology degree. Maybe the money will help. Though it\u2019s terrifying there is an end date \u2013 afterwards people are going to be shunted back to abject poverty. Me? Next week, it looks like I\u2019ll be couch surfing in Brisbane again, where my tribe is.\nI\u2019m a single mum with two kids and usually a full-time chef. The transition from the parenting payment to Newstart, back when my eldest was eight, was rough. We spent three months living in a car. Now I use it to top up my income, but I lost my job in the pandemic. I don\u2019t think that pub will open again.\nUntil they announced they were going to do the coronavirus supplement, I was honestly terrified. I didn\u2019t know what we were going to do for money. I was selling things to keep us going. Until it comes I\u2019ve only got $48 to survive on, and that\u2019s to feed my two girls. I did my grocery shopping this week on $19. Right now my bank balance is 42 cents. When the money does come through, I\u2019ll be replacing some of the stuff I sold.\nThe main thing is to keep paying for my girls\u2019 education. I want them to have a better life than I had so I want to buy them a future. VET courses are $900 a year, combined. Then there\u2019s school books. E-books. Pens and pencils. School bags for when they go back. Uniforms. Their laptops were $1,000 each. Then there\u2019s the internet, which I have to have now at $90 a month. A printer.\nThat supplement is going to make a huge difference to my household, being able to pay the rent, buy food. It\u2019s hope, but then there\u2019ll also be despair at the end. A bit of grief and loss. Because all of a sudden, in October, we\u2019ll go back to nothing again.\nAs told to Royce Kurmelovs. The interviews have been edited for length and clarity\n*Name has been changed",

The drift of pale feathers drew my eye first, left in a generous arc where they had fallen after being plucked from the body. Apart from the tail, legs and sternum, little remained of the bird itself, a small adult female, possibly one of those raised in the same hedge last summer. It seemed to have been eaten from the top down, perhaps the same direction from which it had been attacked, and I ran over in my mind the list of possible assailants.\nIn this quiet wooded corner my suspicions soon fell on our local sparrowhawk. Only an occasional, solitary visitor to the garden, this hawk has shown an especially messy interest in the growing number of collared doves that frequent the beech trees along the lane. They are almost the perfect prey \u2013 large, slow-moving and seemingly not very observant \u2013 and I have seen them fall victim to the hawk on at least two occasions.\nThe first time was an early July morning a few years ago. As I opened the curtains to look across the valley, the sparrowhawk was directly below me in the rough grass, just a few yards from where I would find today\u2019s blackbird, standing on top of a dove and starting to eat. The window was open and the wooden clunk of the curtain rail made it look up. I stayed perfectly still as we regarded each other \u2013 then it took flight and jinked away through the trees, leaving me to literally pick up the pieces.\nMore recently, at dusk in early October, I was alerted by a heavy impact against the glazed back door. It sounded as though a football had hit it, but the perfectly defined bird-shaped grease mark left on the glass told another story. The sparrowhawk perched briefly on a nearby bench, shaking its head as though stunned, before lurching away, leaving its kill behind. This second collared dove was eventually scavenged by a red kite, as perhaps were the remains of the blackbird. Very little goes to waste in the rural food chain.",

The city was locked down, with police blocking all travel in and out, except for essential services.\nThe Fiji Times, an independent newspaper that has been sued by the Fiji government for sedition, were blocked from distributing their newspaper to Lautoka, but allowed delivery drivers carrying the Fiji Sun, the Times\u2019 competition, which is seen as more pro-government, to pass through the blockade.\nThe Fiji police were contacted for comment about why they the Fiji Sun was allowed into Lautoka, but the Fiji Times was blocked.\nConcerns were also raised about Vanuatu, whose government declared it illegal for media outlets to publish reports on coronavirus without the approval of government authorities, citing the need to prevent the spread of misinformation about the disease.\n\u201cThe Vanuatu government\u2019s Orwellian ruling is tantamount to prior censorship,\u201d Bastard said.\n\u201cIt turns itself into a \u2018ministry of Truth\u2019 who could decide what information can be made public and what other information must be hidden from Ni-Vanuatu citizens.\u201d\nDr Shailendra Singh, head of Journalism Programme at the University of the South Pacific, said it was crucial that governments did not intervene in ways that meant: \u201cmedia lose their independence\u2026 the separation of powers is eliminated and media become an arm of the government information ministry.\u201d\nHe said the media\u2019s role in any crisis was crucial, but the challenge was to provide a factual picture without causing undue fear, stress or panic.\n\u201cDuring a crisis the media and government form a partnership where the public safety is paramount. The exchanges should not degenerate into the kind of acrimony we see between the US media and President Trump, where one-upmanship and point-scoring have become the order of the day.\u201d",

        "content": "A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreak\nKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:\nCases are nearing the 3 million mark, according to Johns Hopkins University, with 2,971,669 confirmed. At least 206,549 people have lost their lives in the coronavirus pandemic, though the true toll is likely to be much higher due to underreporting and some countries not including deaths among those with underlying conditions in their tolls.\nThe government reported only one new confirmed case of Covid-19 and said it had eliminated the virus. At 11.59pm on Monday, New Zealand will lift its level-4 lockdown which has been in place for more than four weeks. Jacinda Ardern said the nation had \u201cwon the battle\u201d against widespread community transmission.\nThe US states Colorado, Mississippi, Minnesota, Montana and Tennessee will join other states in the lifting of lockdown restrictions, as economists predict an unemployment rate of 16% or higher for the month of April. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said some regions of the state might qualify to open sooner, \u201cwith certain precautions\u201d, such as upstate New York, as the daily death toll was markedly lower on Sunday than it was on Saturday.\nIt will take the UK economy three years to fully recover from the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, according to EY, a leading forecasting group. As the damage for jobs and growth unfolds, the EY Item Club said it would take until 2023 for the the economy to return to the level reached at the end of last year due to the depth of the crisis, Richard Partington reports.\nBoris Johnson returned to Downing Street on Sunday night for the first time since he was admitted to hospital with Covid-19 on 6 April. The UK reported its lowest daily rise in the death toll since the end of March. The number of deaths in UK hospitals from the coronavirus has risen to 20,732 \u2013 an increase of 413 in the last 24 hours\nUS President Donald Trump, who for a second day skipped the White House press briefing, took to Twitter to deny reports that he planned to fire Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. He said Azar was doing \u201can excellent job!\u201d. Trump also attacked the press, and was roundly mocked after tweeting about \u201cNoble\u201d prize for journalists, seeming to mean the Nobel prizes \u2013 which aren\u2019t awarded in the field of journalism \u2013 or Pulitzers.\nDemonstrators blocked roads through Lebanon late Sunday to protest the deteriorating economic situation, despite a lockdown and curfew imposed because of the coronavirus. Lebanon\u2019s worst economic crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war is now compounded by the coronavirus lockdown. Poverty has risen to 45% of the population, according to official estimates. Its economy is forecast to contract 12% in 2020, according to the International Monetary Fund.\nHealth Minister Greg Hunt said 1.13 million Australians downloaded the tracing app CovidSafe as of 6am (20.00 GMT) on Monday, nearly 4.5% of the country\u2019s population. The app is designed to help medical workers and state governments trace close contacts of Covid-19 patients. Australia has been one of the most successful countries in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, recording just 83 deaths and 6,700 cases, due to border closures, movement restrictions and a stay-at-home policy. It has lowered its infection rate to currently around 1% from 25% in March.\nItaly recorded lowest daily deaths since mid-March and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told the nation \u201cif you love Italy, maintain distance\u201d as he announced a plan that will see the country slowly ease lockdown measures from 4 May. The prime minister of France, Edouard Philippe, will on Tuesday present a national strategy for emerging from the coronavirus lockdown to the national assembly, and Spain partially relaxed its lockdown as its daily death toll dropped below 300 for the first time in weeks.\nEgypt declared on Sunday that it had asked the International Monitory Fund (IMF) for financial assistance to deal with the economic fallout caused by the coronavirus. Neither Egypt nor the IMF specified the size of the one-year bailout loan.",

We have won that battle. But we must remain vigilant if we are to keep it that way,\u201d she said.\nAt 11.59pm on Monday, New Zealand will lift its level-4 lockdown which has been in place for more than four weeks. During that time, almost all businesses have been closed, along with schools while the population has been asked to remain in their homes for all but supermarket visits and short walks.\nArdern said there was no way of knowing what may have happened without the level-4 lockdown.\nBut she warned that in level-3 there were new risks \u2013 namely people coming into more contact with others.\nLevel 3 will see retailers, restaurants and schools allowed to reopen on a smaller scale. Schools will reopen on Wednesday for children up to Year 10 who cannot study from home, or whose parents need to return to work.\nWorkers will also be able to resume on-site work, provided they have a Covid-19 control plan in place, with appropriate health and safety and physical distancing measures. It is expected one million New Zealanders will return to work on Tuesday.\nHowever, Ardern warned the public of bringing too many people into expanded family \u201cbubbles\u201d.\n\u201cWe are opening up the economy, but we\u2019re not opening up people\u2019s social lives,\u201d Ardern said.\nThe director general of health, Ashley Bloomfield, said that the transmission of the virus had been \u201celiminated\u201d. This did not mean zero cases, but that health officials knew where all new cases were coming from.\nArdern was also optimistic \u2013 asked if New Zealand had eliminated Covid-19, she replied \u201ccurrently\u201d.\nNew Zealand\u2019s transmission rate \u2013 the number of people each infected person can pass the virus to \u2013 was now under 0.4, compared to the average overseas transmission rate of 2.5.\nBloomfield said Covid-19 was a \u201ctricky virus\u201d and New Zealanders needed to remain vigilant. He reported one more Covid-19 related death on Monday. The nation\u2019s 19th victim was a woman in her 90s. There was one new confirmed case and four probably cases, he said.\nArdern said the country would remain at level 3 for two weeks before cabinet decided on whether to move to level 2.\n\u201cWe can only do this if we continue to pull together. If we need to stay at level 3 [for longer] we will.\u201d\nShe also said she was hopeful that New Zealand and Australia might be able to create a trans-Tasman bubble at some time in the future, possibly allowing travel between the two countries, but the focus was making sure both countries were domestically managing the virus.\nDespite the optimistic numbers, both Bloomfield and Ardern warned against complacency.\n\u201cTo succeed we must hunt down the last few cases of the virus,\u201d said Ardern. \u201cThis is like looking for a needle in a haystack.\u201d\nTo that end, a contact tracing app for Covid-19 would also be available in the next fortnight, however, Ardern said that had limitations.",

This is Martin Farrer bringing you the top stories to start the week.\nBoris Johnson will resume control of Britain\u2019s faltering response to the coronavirus crisis today as pressure mounts on his government to spell out how it will begin to ease the lockdown and reopen schools and businesses. The prime minister last night returned to Downing Street where the question of how to lift restrictions is the most pressing matter in an overflowing in-tray, which also includes fixing the government\u2019s decision-making structure and dealing with the Brexit talks impasse. How to reach the target of 100,000 tests per day is also a key issue and ministers are considering ordering millions of antibody testing kits in the hope of establishing immunity levels across the country.\nAs countries across Europe plan to ease some lockdown restrictions this week, pressure on Johnson to do the same is especially strong from business leaders who have appealed for more clarity about Britain\u2019s exit strategy. The tourism sector faces the worst of the job losses, a new report says today, with areas such as the Yorkshire Dales, Cornwall and Wales worst hit. The latest EY Item Club forecast says the economy could take three years to recover from the impact of Covid-19. But businesses themselves could face scrutiny thanks to a thinktank report that says FTSE100 companies using the taxpayer-funded furlough scheme paid their bosses an average of \u00a33.6m last year.\nHospital coronavirus deaths in Britain were 413 yesterday, taking the total to 20,732 out of 154,037 cases. There are almost three million cases around the world and more than 200,000 deaths, although Wuhan now officially has no coronavirus cases.

The prime minister\u2019s advisers have warned him that the negotiations that started last week are on track to fail. Europe\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has accused the UK of not engaging with key issues such as fishing rights, and the so-called level playing field conditions to ensure neither side can undercut environmental, labour and social standards.\nKim \u2018is alive\u2019 \u2013 Kim Jong-un is alive and well despite widespread rumours that he was seriously ill with heart trouble, according to a security adviser to the South Korean president. Moon Chung-in said overnight: \u201cOur government position is firm. Kim Jong-un is alive and well\u201d, adding that the North Korean leader had been staying in Wonsan \u2013 a resort town on the country\u2019s east coast \u2013 since 13 April.\nChildren stabbed \u2013 A one-year-old girl and a three-year-old boy have been stabbed to death at a home in Ilford in east London. The girl was pronounced dead at the scene on Sunday evening, while the boy died in hospital, police said. A 40-year-old man was taken to hospital for treatment. A murder investigation has been launched although no one else is being sought for the crime. All three were known to each other.\nPoet\u2019s corner \u2013 A host of actors and celebrities will publish online readings of William Wordsworth to mark the 250th anniversary of the romantic poet\u2019s birth. They include Stephen Fry, Brian Cox, Caroline Quentin, Ruth Wilson and Hugh Bonneville. The Hollywood star William H Macy will read She Dwelt Among the Untrodden Ways. It comes after the poet\u2019s descendants were forced by the Covid-19 outbreak to scrap plans for a series of celebrations in the Lake District.\nNew Zealand claims it has eliminated the virus after recording only one confirmed case in the past 24 hours and will now ease its lockdown restrictions. One million Australians have downloaded an app to help health officials with contact tracing as some state governments start to ease the lockdown.\nDonald Trump\u2019s coronavirus coronavirus response coordinator, Dr Deborah Birx, has warned that Americans should expect social distancing measures to remain in place throughout the summer. The US needed better testing before it could reopen more fully, she said, as the president failed to deliver a media briefing for the second day running. For light relief, read our review of Saturday Night Live, in which Brad Pitt appears as another of Trump\u2019s advisers, Dr Anthony Fauci, to explain the president\u2019s claims about treating the virus.\nThe scientist leading Germany\u2019s much-praised response has given us a fascinating question and answer session in which he thinks Britain was too late to start testing and suspects China\u2019s raccoon dog-breeding industry could be linked to the outbreak.\nFrom his temporary home in Rio de Janerio, the Guardian\u2019s Latin America correspondent, Tom Phillips, can hear the nightly protests against Brazilian president Jair Bolsorano\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, where cases are steadily rising.

Dominic Thiem has firmly rejected the idea that the world\u2019s top tennis players should chip in to help lower-ranked competitors who are struggling financially. Sports stars were among the fundraisers for the 2.6 Challenge, which in the absence of the London Marathon has so far raised more than \u00a35m for charities during the coronavirus lockdown. Serie A has edged closer to resuming behind closed doors after Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, gave the go-ahead for professional sports teams to resume training in May. UK politicians spoke up in support of racing\u2019s ruling body and its chief executive, Nick Rust, after leaked emails showed high-profile trainers had called on Rust to quit and criticised him for a lack of leadership during the coronavirus crisis. And the New England head coach, Bill Belichick, has said not taking a quarterback in the Patriots\u2019 first post-Tom Brady draft \u201cwas not by design\u201d.\nVirgin Atlantic is seeking emergency backers as it teeters on the brink of collapse. The UK government has rejected Richard Branson\u2019s suggestion that it could receive state funds to help prevent bankruptcy while its fleet is grounded. Asian stocks rose overnight and the FTSE100 is on course for a healthy 1% lift at the opening bell. The pound is worth $1.233 and \u20ac1.145.\nThe PM\u2019s return to work is the lead in most papers. \u201cPM returns to face critics and talk of a \u2018new normal\u2019\u201d, says the Guardian, while the Telegraph has a blunt promise: \u201cJohnson to ease the lockdown this week\u201d.

        "content": "No new patients in city at centre of pandemic but fears over new infections persist\nThe Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus pandemic began, has discharged all of its coronavirus patients, as the nation reported only three new cases and no new deaths.\nAccording to the National Health Commission, as of Sunday the number of new coronavirus patients in Wuhan was at zero. \u201cThanks to the joint efforts of Wuhan and medical staff from around the country,\u201d said a spokesman for the commission, Mi Feng.\nTwo of the three new cases on Sunday were imported infections, while the third was a locally transmitted case in the northeastern border province of Heilongjiang, which has seen an uptick in cases as Chinese nationals have rushed back home from Russia.\nChina, which has recorded more than 82,000 cases and a total of 4,633 deaths, has begun to gradually reopen after months of paralysis. On Monday, almost 50,000 high school students in their third year, the most important for preparing for the national university entrance exam known as the gaokao, returned to class in Beijing. Other cities and provinces have announced various dates for reopening schools.\nAt the same time, authorities are still worried about a second wave of infections. On Sunday, Beijing announced new regulations for \u201cpromoting civilised behaviour\u201d that include requiring residents to cover their mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, not eating on public transport, and wearing a mask in public when sick.\nRestaurants are also required to provide serving utensils and to encourage separate portions, over the traditional shared family-style meals, when possible. The regulations come into force on 1 June.\nChina has faced questions over its officially reported figures and recently revised the death toll in Wuhan from the virus upwards by 50%. Among residents, worries about a second wave of infections, caused by asymptomatic patients or imported cases, persist, especially as authorities implement new restrictions. Beijing has added seven days of \u201chealth observation\u201d to those who have completed 14 days of quarantine, in which residents are discouraged from going outside.\nIn Shenzhen, which is home to 461 infections, port authorities said that as of Tuesday, anyone entering the city through one of its ports must undergo quarantine. Since late last month, all international arrivals to the city have had to undergo a nucleic acid test for the virus as well 14 days of quarantine.\nTensions between China and other countries suffering from the virus have continued to flare. At the weekend, China\u2019s ambassador to Australia said that the country\u2019s pursuit of an independent query into the origins of the virus could result in consumer retaliation from China.\nTies between the US and China have also deteriorated. A Republican party memo seen by Politico called on candidates to target China in public remarks on pandemic.\n\u201cDon\u2019t defend Trump, other than the China Travel Ban \u2014 attack China,\u201d the memo said, according to Politico. \u201cCoronavirus was a Chinese hit-and-run followed by a cover-up that cost thousands of lives\u201d.\nOn Sunday, Hu Zhaoming, a former ambassador, and spokesperson for the Chinese Communist party\u2019s international liaison department, called for \u201csome people\u201d in the US to swallow disinfectant, mocking Donald Trump\u2019s recent widely-mocked suggestion that people inject disinfectant to fight the virus.\nMr. President is right. Some people do need to be injected with #disinfectant, or at least gargle with it. That way they won't spread the virus, lies and hatred when talking.\nAs China\u2019s cases appeared to fall, several of the hardest-hit countries in Europe are plotting a way out of lockdown.\nSpain partially relaxed its lockdown on Sunday as its daily death toll dropped below 300 for the first time in weeks. Children under 14 were allowed out to exercise for the first time since mid-March, and the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has announced that adults could also be allowed to exercise outside from next weekend.\nItaly\u2019s Giuseppe Conte announced a plan to begin easing lockdown measures starting on 4 May, telling the nation \u201cif you love Italy, maintain distance\u201d.\nFrance\u2019s prime minister \u00c9douard Philippe is to present an exit strategy to parliament on Tuesday. In the US, several states including Colorado, Montana, Minnesota, Mississippi and Tennessee will start lifting restrictions.\nOther coronavirus developments include:\nIn the UK, the prime minister Boris Johnson will return to work on Monday after recovering from coronavirus and will be under pressure over his government\u2019s handling of the crisis.\nThe New Zealand prime minister has said that the country had \u201cwon the battle\u201d against widespread transmission of coronavirus as the nation prepares to ease lockdown measures.\nOne million people have downloaded a new app in Australia designed to help medical workers and state governments trace close contacts of Covid-19 patients.\nDonald Trump, who skipped another White House briefing on Sunday night, denied he plans to fire health and human services secretary Alex Azar.",

        "content": "In growing impasse, government signals it might force homes to ease restrictions\nAged care residents and their families are caught in the crossfire of an escalating stand-off between the federal government and the sector over visiting rights during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nAhead of a meeting with providers on Friday, the government suggested it was prepared to force homes to allow each resident two visitors a day, in line with official health guidelines, if operators did not ease their own rules.\nOn Monday, a coalition of 1,000 aged care homes and their representatives roundly rejected the government\u2019s request and disputed claims elevated by the prime minister that some homes were simply locking residents in their rooms.\n\u201cAged care providers have made extremely difficult decisions for enhanced resident protections on visitation in order to reduce the number of potential exposures to the vulnerable people in our care,\u201d they said in the statement.\nThe impasse leaves families and residents at times abiding by vastly different rules at different homes, regardless of whether there have been confirmed cases within a facility.\nIn March, the government launched new guidelines that stated aged care homes could allow residents to have two visitors per day.\nBut the Guardian reported that many of country\u2019s largest operators had gone beyond that, banning visits in what some providers described as \u201cvoluntary lockdown\u201d, prompting concerns from advocates of a knee-jerk reaction.\nThe Council on the Ageing chief executive, Ian Yates, told Guardian Australia on Monday he remained concerned about the level of visitor restrictions imposed by some providers.\n\u201cI\u2019m listening to some saying their members are very flexible, for example about people who are dying or residents who have severe dementia, but we have too many cases where that is not happening,\u201d he said.\nYates acknowledged there were \u201ctwo sides\u201d to the debate and proposed a code of conduct to providers as a middle ground.\n\u201cBut so far we haven\u2019t had that reciprocated,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIf the provider feels the need to be stronger than the national guidelines, there [should be] certain guarantees. In that case then everybody would know what is happening.\n\u201cAt the moment it\u2019s quite arbitrary. Two providers in the same suburb will be doing something different.\u201d\nGlobally, aged care facilities have been ravaged by Covid-19, with the WHO reporting that up to half of all deaths in Europe were in nursing homes.\nIn New South Wales, authorities are dealing with a cluster at Newmarch House, run by non-profit Anglicare, which was sparked when a staff member tested positive, and has killed six residents and seen more than 50 residents and staff contract the virus.\nPatricia Sparrow, chief executive of non-profit peak body Aged and Community Services Australia, told the Guardian on Monday providers needed the right to impose restrictions beyond the AHPPC guidance.\nShe acknowledged that providers had instituted extra visitor restrictions in an \u201cnumber of instances\u201d but said the peak body did not have data stating how many of its members had gone beyond the government guidelines.\nAlthough the outbreak at Newmarch had been sparked by a staff member, Sparrow said it highlighted why aged care homes were so insistent that they be able to further limit visits.\nThe decision of providers to dig in sets up a showdown with the government after Morrison took a hard line on Friday, saying the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee\u2019s \u201cvery clear medical advice\u201d was that visits were safe.\nHe said unless providers voluntarily loosened restrictions, he would force them to apply for an exemption to impose rules that were tougher than the health guidelines.\n\u201cThere are quite valid reasons why you would have exemptions, particularly as we\u2019ve seen in north-west Tasmania at the moment, or what we\u2019ve seen in western Sydney or in other places,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut more broadly, having people stuck in their rooms, not being able to be visited by their loved ones and carers and other support people, that\u2019s not OK.\u201d\nSparrow outright rejected claims that residents were locked in their rooms in facilities where visitors had been banned.\nSome providers have adopted the use of iPads and other digital tools to allow residents to communicate with loved ones, while others have established other novel methods such as \u201cwindow visits\u201d.\nWhile he pointed to these positive examples, Yates said there was also a need for provider peak bodies to pull their \u201crecalcitrant members into line\u201d.\nHe cited cases such as an operator threatening to call the police on a family attempting to communicate with a loved one from afar.\n\u201cThey were just trying to communicate through a window,\u201d he said.\nYates added that only \u201ca minority of people in residential care\u201d had family coming to visiting them.\n\u201cThe idea that there will be a flood of people coming in is a bit carried away,\u201d he said.\nThe Guardian contacted the aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, for comment.",

Two were found on fire at his house, and officers in Halifax located the third at another one of [Gabriel] Wortman\u2019s properties.\u2019\n\u2018The whole thing, from first frame to the last, was really rough. And even a bit offensive. I get annoyed when people criticise movies from the 1940s for being politically incorrect, but for something as recent as 1994 Forrest Gump is one sexist film.\u2019\n\u2018Every morning I wake up at seven when our gibbon, Jimmy, starts singing loudly. I take a coffee into the garden and chat to the harrier hawks and the ibis in the aviary. We\u2019ve hand-reared baby animals in our lodge. We took turns to feed our sloth, Edward, through the night when his mother couldn\u2019t. Beanie, a newborn giant anteater, lived with us, too.\u2019\n\u2018Riley has described [Laura] Murray\u2019s tweet as an \u201cappalling distortion of the truth\u201d and is now suing for damages. She says Murray\u2019s tweet contained \u201cdefamatory statements of fact\u201d about her. In her defence, Murray argued that the tweet was not defamatory and was a statement of her opinion.\u2019\n\u2018The problem with watching a show so late is that you can\u2019t discuss it with other people. I\u2019m not going to phone my friends and say, \u201cDo you remember in Game Of Thrones about seven years ago when they had that Red Wedding? That was mad, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\u2019\n\u2018After slipping on rocks as slippery as polished ice, Abramovi\u0107 and her guide found themselves hanging over an abyss. She found homes and stables built into the winding wall, and other parts that had been dismantled by locals who, under Mao\u2019s encouragement to \u201ckill the dragon\u201d, had removed the clay and stones to build with. Once, Abramovi\u0107 claimed to have walked through a kilometre of human bones.\u2019\n\u2018He says he just knew: \u201cIt just felt so comfortable that I knew this would be the person I\u2019d spend the rest of my life with. Margaret agrees: \u201c[It was like] putting the key in the lock and it fits and you turn the key and your life was on the other side of the door.\u201d\u2019\n\u2018What did you talk about? Cricket, bad chat-up lines, the fact that my friend encouraged me to do this because I\u2019m apparently single and desperate, the accents we do when we get drunk and lie about our identities (me: scouse, him: South African). Everything but coronavirus.\u2019\n\u2018In August, it will be 65 years since the battered and bloated body of the 14-year-old Till was fished from the muddy waters of the Tallahatchie River in Mississippi. His kidnapping, torture and murder on 28 August 1955 for having whistled at a white woman was a defining moment of postwar American history, sparking the civil rights movement.\u2019\n\u2018Until recently, one of the best British postwar ceramics collections was to be found on a council estate in east London. \u201cIt was a bit like walking into a reliquary,\u201d says the ceramicist Annie Turner. \u201cYou\u2019d go into a pretty brutal-looking 1970s building and up a dull concrete stairwell and think, \u2018Am I in the right place?\u2019. Then you opened this door, and it was like entering another world.\u201d\u2019\n\u2018Only Peter Reid is really running around. He dispossesses Maradona, loses his boot and keeps on running. For 15 minutes he\u2019s the best player on the pitch. His opposite number is Sergio Batista, who despite being only 23 has perfected the classic bearded serial killer midfielder look. The crowd noise is an ambient hum through this, with sudden vague hisses of excitement.\u2019\n\u2018Behold the British restaurant chain. Now that we all speak fluent independent bistro, taqueria and live fire grill, we are, of course, meant to look disdainfully upon them and all their works. Which, in true Carrie Bradshaw style, raises the simplest of questions: are the chains a valuable part of the British restaurant landscape?\u2019\n\u2018Though Biden has been coy about his preferences, he has been consistent in his requirement that his running mate be someone he \u201ccompletely trusts\u201d to carry out his agenda yet is unafraid to challenge him on major decisions. Biden told a Pittsburgh radio station that he would select Michelle Obama as his running mate \u201cin a heartbeat\u201d but suspected that she has no \u201cdesire to live near the White House again\u201d.\u2019\n\u2018My mood during the weeks before the operation was the kind of hysterical calm you\u2019d expect from someone who\u2019s just made an appointment to get hit by a lorry.

The Fiji rugby union chairman has been denied a visa for the US but astonishingly he emerged as a key supporter of Beaumont\u2019s bid.

Similarly, there have been problems with women\u2019s matches staged on the same day as the men\u2019s - often in different cities \u2013 ensuring supporters are not able to attend both.\nThere was also considerable disbelief at the decision to stage France v England \u2013 effectively the title decider \u2013 on the opening weekend of the 2020 tournament. That match, won 19-13 by England, attracted a bumper crowd of 14,000 while 11,000 saw them thrash Wales on 7 March at the Stoop.\nThis year was the second in a row organisers failed to attract a title sponsor for the women\u2019s championship. There is no prize money either while \u00a316m is available in the men\u2019s tournament, and there is a growing sense that a new window would help resolve that. The most recent World Cup, in August 2017, gives an idea of the audiences available to a standalone women\u2019s competition. The final attracted a peak audience of 2.6m on ITV.\n\u201cWe are studying a possible specific window different to the men\u2019s as part of an update to the global calendar for the women\u2019s international game,\u201d said a Six Nations spokesperson. \u201cThis is a working option right now, no decision is made yet.\u201d\nIt is understood the proposal was being considered before the coronavirus pandemic but the disruption could accelerate the move when rugby returns. The women\u2019s calendar has already been disrupted by the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics to 2021. There are just six weeks between the end of the Games and the start of the World Cup in New Zealand and far more women move between sevens and XVs than in the men\u2019s game.\nFirstly, however, the 2020 Six Nations needs to be completed. England, with four wins from four, are the champions elect with Italy left to play, but six matches need to be rescheduled owing to the coronavirus outbreak.",

Samal was inspired to create the series when the Guardian invited her to contribute an idea to an article proposing an \u201caction plan for theatre\u201d after venues were closed by coronavirus. \u201cThat was the first time I thought practically about how to stay creative and connected in isolation,\u201d said Samal. \u201cOnce I\u2019d written it down, I had to see if it worked.\u201d\nIn the article, and on social media, Samal invited creatives to get in touch if they were interested in collaborating. She then devised a questionnaire for them to complete and, based on their answers, matched up trios of actors, writers and directors. \u201cIt was quite confusing and involved a very complicated spreadsheet. The idea was to introduce people to each other digitally, and have a mix of experience levels, disciplines and styles. Some people set up their own partnerships as well. It was all fairly fluid. People want to make stuff.\u201d\nThe pieces have sprung from creative discussions on Skype and apps such as Houseparty and many of them reflect on our new dependence on digital communication, whether it be colleagues holding meetings on Zoom or couples separated by quarantine struggling to stay connected through the lockdown.\nWhen You Host Your First Zoom is written by Stefanie Reynolds and directed by Leon Lopez. In the film, Esther Uwejeyah plays a team leader whose fuzzy jargon fails to unite her employees. It\u2019s an initially comic piece that gradually emphasises how remote working has left many frayed, frustrated and unsure of their rights. Digital Detox by James McDermott, also directed by Lopez, stars Kane Surry and Elliot Hadley as partners whose relationship is put under strain when one of them is forced to remain in Italy with an ex he is visiting.\nSamal has written two pieces herself and one of them, Bangers, is striking in its intimate depiction of touch at this time of social distancing. The piece, she said, explores \u201cthe residue that misogynistic music leaves on us and our attitude to sex, gender and relationships\u201d. It is directed by Nadia Papachronopoulou, with music by Theo Ogundipe.\nMore than a dozen videos are planned, to be released over the next fortnight, and Samal will be spotlighting the different artists involved on her Twitter and Instagram accounts. The videos will be featured on the Guardian and shared on YouTube and the Virtual Collaborators website. Among the individuals involved with the project are Nikesh Shukla, Anjli Mohindra, Sacha Dhawan, Joseph Adelakun, Milli Bhatia and J\u00falia Levai.\nSamal\u2019s previous plays include Out of Sorts, staged at London\u2019s Theatre503 in 2019, and Busking It, which she performed herself at the Edinburgh fringe and HighTide festivals and was based on her 10 years as a London Underground busker. Her upcoming acting credits include a role in The Great, a Hulu TV series that stars Elle Fanning as Catherine the Great. \u201cAs an actor, shutdown initially felt like it had taken away my future,\u201d Samal said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming so looking ahead felt pointless. But I\u2019m beginning to adapt. I write a lot (it\u2019s escapism), and start projects like this.\u201d\nSince venues were forced to close in mid-March, a huge number of digital theatre projects have been announced. The National Theatre of Scotland, Home in Manchester, HighTide and Headlong were among the first companies to commission major online programmes of work exploring life in lockdown. For Graeae\u2019s Crips without Constraints, deaf and disabled writers were commissioned to create monologues written in isolation that either focus on the current crisis or something completely different.\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to see what people are making online, how creative they\u2019ve become,\u201d said Samal. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard to rebuild theatre, it won\u2019t be the same, but I think artists will work hard to adapt and support each other. The funny flipside of this is that suddenly we\u2019re all unemployed and worried so the judgment about being \u2018successful\u2019 has eased. Artists are being much nicer to each other.\u201d As for the forthcoming Virtual Collaborators dramas , she said: \u201cI\u2019m as excited as anyone to see what is made each week.\u201d\nWatch all of the Virtual Collaborators films",

        "content": "Kylie Minogue, leather jackets, grown-up sex scenes ... no wonder we backcombed our hair to blag our way in\nJanuary 1990: the first month of a thrilling new decade. I am embracing the mood by jumping on the 111 bus from my small South Walian village, jetting off to the buzzing metropolis of Swansea. I am joined on this illicit adventure by three school-friends. We have spent hours debating what coloured jeans we should wear and spraying our backcombed fringes into frosty tsunamis. We have to pass a huge test at the newly opened UCI cinema, after all. We have to look 12, and I\u2019m a few months off that yet.\nMy favourite film when I was 12 \u2013 and yes, honestly, Mr UCI, I\u2019m really, genuinely 12, ignore my quivering knees and my huge bag of strawberry shoelaces \u2013 was the first film I was brave enough to fake my age for (and yes, I got in). That film was The Delinquents, starring my ultimate heroine, Kylie Minogue. I\u2019d convinced myself I had known Minogue well since I was nine. She regularly accompanied my tea in front of the TV, on Neighbours. She was cute, she was funny, but her car mechanic character, Charlene, also stood her ground; her first appearance on the show involved her punching Scott Robinson (Jason Donovan), who later became her husband. She was quick-tempered, as I was, but also rebellious in a safe, gentle way. She was everything I wanted to be.\nBut in The Delinquents, Minogue turned up the trangressiveness. This was clear from the moment I saw the poster for it in the pages of Smash Hits: she was dressed in a leather jacket and bodice, passionately stretching her neck back, which was being kissed by Charlie Schlatter. The display felt impossibly provocative. Going through the confusion of puberty, I didn\u2019t quite know what to do with it. Looking back, I\u2019m sure it felt like she was growing up for all of us, getting interested in things we were getting interested in, despite the fact that those things \u2013 to most of us, anyway \u2013 still felt totally alien.\nThe Delinquents was set in the 1950s, a period well-known to any kids who had grown up in the 1980s. That whole decade had been obsessed with commercialising the neon-lit nostalgia of early rock\u2019n\u2019roll, and the growing chasm between the generations, and what that all meant for the ignition of the new spirit of accessible culture. Watching the film again all these years later, its rebelliousness begins gently. Minogue plays Lola Lovell, a vision in a pastel-blue, A-lined dress, noticing an American boy that she likes on the roof of the cinema. She laughs \u2013 he\u2019s taking down the letters advertising the latest film \u2013 then she politely approaches the cinema\u2019s owner outside. \u201cExcuse me, will you be getting Rock Around the Clock back again any time? It was really popular!! She beams, like a giddy head girl. \u201cNot with normal people,\u201d he grouches.\nThen Brownie Hansen \u2013 the boy taking down the letters \u2013 jumps down. They get talking. They like books. They like music. Names of their favourites rush out, instant connections suddenly fizzing together \u2013 this, precisely this, is what love will be like, I bet I thought. Brownie teaches Lola rock-and-roll dancing. They end a practice with their legs wrapped around each other on floor: they approach each other breathing slowly, and they kiss. This was courting as I knew it would be: heady and feverish, but also blissfully simple.\nThen things got hotter (predictably, The Delinquents was known in our school by the boys as the film where Kylie got her boobs out). Then they get darker: Lola gets pregnant, and the couple run away, but get caught, then Lola\u2019s mother forces her to have an abortion. Things go downhill quickly from here \u2013 Lola gets sent away to live with her aunt, then gets put in a young offenders\u2019 institute for underage drinking, then her friend dies in labour, all of which seems a bit of a harsh learning curve \u2013 but the scenes I remember best are still oddly delightful. In one, she\u2019s bleach-haired, telling her mother what she does with the the boy she\u2019s not allowed to love. \u201cI love the way he kisses me,\u201d she says, lustily. Then she puts her face right up to her mother\u2019s. \u201cI love the way he looks when he\u2019s \u2026 just \u2026 about ... to \u2026\u201d Kylie, come, come.\nI kept up my obsession with The Delinquents for a while, but then I moved on (New Kids on the Block had arrived by that point). I never really abandoned Kylie, though, buying her records and watching her films as I moved from adolescence to adulthood. I finally met her properly years later, interviewing her for a magazine in 2014 \u2013 we even talked about her Welsh family on the side of her mother, Carol, which made me feel that we had our own fizzing connection.\nI mentioned faking my age to see her in the Swansea UCI nearly 25 years earlier, and she laughed. \u201cWhat a rebel!\u201d she said, bouncily, politely, and I nearly caved in. The backcombed-fringed wannabe delinquent had achieved her dream, after all.",

        "content": "Seaside mayors debate idea to ensure Covid-19 distancing, amid claims of discrimination\nA proposal by the mayor of the Belgian seaside resort of Ostend for locals to get priority beach passes this summer to ensure physical distancing has ignited claims of discrimination and a debate about access to the coastline.\nThe Belgian government outlined a plan to gradually lift its coronavirus lockdown last week, but with holidays abroad likely to remain impossible, the burgemeester Bart Tommelein has received tentative backing from the government\u2019s top virologist for his plan of a system of passes to keep people on beaches safe this summer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be an ants\u2019 nest here,\u201d Tommelein said when he proposed the beach passes plan, or strandpas in the local Flemish dialect used in the north of Belgium.\nThe mayor\u2019s sliding scale of priority, with tax-paying locals, second home owners and hotel guests given preference, has provoked criticism among the other nine coastal municipalities, and sparked a discussion about the right of all Belgians to access the country\u2019s sandy beaches.\n\u201cAre we going to have to put gates at the entrance to the beaches?\u201d asked Daphn\u00e9 Dumery, the mayor of Blankenberge, 12 miles (19km) north of Ostend. \u201cIf a train full of vacationers arrives, will I have to send them home? Do I need to hire new police to deal with this?\u201d\nL\u00e9opold Lippens, the mayor of Knokke-Heist, a resort 30 miles (48km) north of Ostend, said: \u201cEither the beaches are open or they are closed. I do not differentiate between the Flemish, the Walloons, the Brussels residents, the Germans.\u201d\nBelgium has three national languages and communities: French, spoken by the Walloon community in the south; Dutch, by the Flemish in the north; and German by a small community on the eastern border.\nThe country\u2019s coastline has been heavily developed over the years, in part because of a longstanding Belgian ethos that everyone should have access to cheap accommodation for holidays by the beach.\nJean-Marie Dedecker, a former coach of Belgium\u2019s national judo team who is the mayor of Middelkerke, a seaside resort south of Ostend, told the Guardian that the proposed policy was doomed.\nA video conference last Friday for the mayors failed to reach a consensus, with the technology only adding heat to the discussions. \u201cWith a video conference you can\u2019t discuss things \u2026 and I have a big mouth,\u201d said Dedecker.\nDedecker said he would join his fellow mayors at a face-to-face meeting of Belgium\u2019s coastal mayors on Wednesday to debate the issue and present a single policy for endorsement by the national government.\nDedecker said: \u201cThe mayor of Ostend said we have to close the beach, let us say, for foreigners. Residents can go to the beach, or if they don\u2019t go then people in hotels and those who have second homes on the coast can go \u2026 Only then the normal day-trippers could go on the beach.\n\u201cI absolutely disagree \u2013 it is discrimination for the first thing. Not only against Walloons but a lot of Flemish people are coming to the coast. About 30% of our tourists are Walloons, 70% are others, mostly Flemish people. It is discrimination. Beaches are for everyone.\u201d\nBelgium\u2019s coastline is heavily built-up with what is commonly described as an Atlantic wall of apartment blocks, built in the 1950s and 1960s when the philosophy was that all Belgians should be able to find comfortable and affordable accommodation by the sea.\n\u201cThe idea was that everyone can come to the coast and can find a proper apartment or go camping, rich and poor,\u201d said Dedecker. \u201cThat was the politics of 50s and 60s. Then you have an ugly coast but everyone can go.\u201d\nDedecker said he believed distancing between beachgoers could easily be organised on Belgium\u2019s broad sandy beaches.\nHe said: \u201cI am expecting a lot of people this summer. People will not travel to Spain, Turkey or Italy.\n\u201cWe have a huge beach in Middelkerke. We have 12 swimming zones and we have made a calculation that we can put 65,000 people sitting in the sun and they all have a space of 36 sq metres. We have very fresh air. And everybody is already doing social distancing so they will do that on the beaches.\u201d\nThe Belgian prime minister, Sophie Wilm\u00e8s, announced plans on Friday to lift restrictions over the next two months, with restaurants reopening and, potentially, permits for day trips being introduced in time for the summer.\n\u201cPeople have to come because our economy is falling down,\u201d said Dedecker. \u201cIf we start choosing who can come we will die. We have had an \u2018English\u2019 winter \u2013 a lot of rain. Stormy weather. We need a beautiful summer.\u201d",

I was upset, very upset. I slept on the street,\u201d the 30-year-old said.\nPolice eventually found a hotel willing to rent Nnabugwu a room.\n\u201cWe use the receptionist to order food,\u201d Nnabugwu said. \u201cIf they [food delivery companies] know it is a foreigner ordering food they will not come. You cannot buy anything in a shop; if you go in they will cover their face and chase you out.\u201d\nKidus Mulugeta, an Ethiopian who moved to China four years ago to study mechanical engineering, said the atmosphere in Guangzhou had changed rapidly.\n\u201cIt was so fast,\u201d he said. \u201cI went into quarantine \u2026 We were treated fine. Then we came out. Everything was different, uncomfortable. Like Chinese people changed their minds.\u201d\nMulugeta, who has a job offer at a Chinese company when he graduates, said many African people found it impossible to rent accommodation and hadn\u2019t been allowed into supermarkets.\n\u201cThey say \u2018no foreigners\u2019, but if it\u2019s a Russian or European, they allow white people to enter,\u201d he said.\nA Ghanaian computer science student said he had been in a hotel when police officers took him to another hotel to be mandatorily quarantined and he was tested more than five times. \n The 25-year-old, who requested anonymity, said he was denied entry at \u201cabout 15 hotels\u201d and slept on the streets. \u201c I have been denied entry into public places, denied into restaurants. All the tests they did have been negative.\u201d\nAnger in Africa rose earlier this month when images of African residents in Guangzhou being barred from various locations began circulating on social media. Other images showed evicted Africans sleeping on the streets.\nChina has maintained strict screening protocols, concerned about any resurgence in infections by virus carriers who exhibit no symptoms or by infected people arriving from abroad.\nAuthorities have limited international flights and blocked almost all foreigners from entering the country, as well as required mandatory centralised quarantines for those returning from overseas. Experts say such wariness has given rise to new levels of xenophobia and that Africans have borne the brunt of this.\nGuangzhou tightened measures after reporting more than 100 imported cases of Covid-19, including 25 involving foreign nationals, some from Africa, Chinese state media reported. The new measures included retrospective screening of previous arrivals.\nAfrican leaders are generally reluctant to criticise China, which has loaned governments massive sums and provided medical assistance in recent weeks, but the reports provoked rare official protests to Beijing.\nMany African leaders were shocked by the vehemence of the online reaction in Africa to the incidents, said Cobus Van Staden, an expert in China-Africa relations at the South African Institute of International Affairs. \u201cThey realised there was domestic pressure \u2026 They usually tend to downplay [problems] but I think they realised that would be politically impossible this time,\u201d he said.\nA number of African states called in Chinese ambassadors and the African Union, which represents more than 50 states, said the discrimination had caused grief, pain and humiliation to all Africans.\nGhana\u2019s information minister, Kojo Oppong Nkrumah, told the Guardian his government had summoned the Chinese ambassador for \u201ca very stern conversation\u201d.\nChinese officials moved quickly to deal with the initial accusations of discrimination. The Chinese embassy in Nairobi, for instance, told Kenya\u2019s foreign ministry that authorities in Guangzhou \u201chave been tasked to take immediate action to safeguard the legitimate rights of the Africans concerned\u201d.\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian acknowledged at the time that \u201cthere might be some misunderstandings in the implementation of measures\u201d designed to prevent \u201coverseas imports\u201d of the virus. China treated all foreigners equally, Zhao said.\nHowever, Beijing has also tried to suggest that reports of Africans targeted in Guangzhou are a plot to smear the country. An editorial in the state-run Global Times said western media, US politicians and \u201cHong Kong separatists\u201d were among those \u201chyping\u201d such incidents.\nRoberto Castillo, an assistant professor at Lingnan University in Hong Kong who has been researching the African presence in China, said: \u201cUnsurprisingly, China\u2019s response was to deflect and spin the narrative as yet another situation distorted by western media and fake news, and to point out that China does not discriminate against any foreigners.\u201d\nChina has made massive strides in its political, commercial and cultural presence in Africa in recent years and launched a diplomatic offensive at the beginning of the pandemic. The row over racism threatens some of these gains.\n\u201cThe images of black people sleeping under bridges, families with children being evicted from their legally rented places of abode, as well as entrance and service denial to blacks, were seen by many as Chinese racism and as a Chinese betrayal of African solidarity in these difficult times,\u201d said Castillo.",

        "content": "In 2017, just three adult females remained in the wild, now a much larger group will leave Tasmania to fly north for the winter\nThere has been little good to say about the recent history of the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot. Numbers of the small migratory bird, which makes a return trip from Tasmania\u2019s south-west wilderness to the mainland\u2019s coastal scrubland each year, have fallen so sharply scientists consider it at risk of extinction within five years.\nJust 23 birds arrived at the species\u2019 breeding site at Melaleuca, deep in the Tasmanian World Heritage Wilderness Area, last spring.\nBut six months on there are tentative positive signs, with the number of birds heading north for the winter reaching 118, the first time the flock has topped 100 in more than a decade.\nDr Shannon Troy, a wildlife biologist with the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment, says the population has swelled in three ways, some of them the result of work undertaken by a national recovery team.\nThe group of migrating birds arriving in Melaleuca for the breeding season were met by a further 34 adult birds released from captivity, including some from a new breeding facility at Five Mile Beach, near Hobart airport. The adults from different backgrounds together produced 37 fledglings, and were joined by another 49 captive-bred juveniles.\nNot every bird survived the warmer months until the parrots headed north between February and April, and the rigours of long-haul travel means less than half those that leave are likely to return.\nTroy says a good scenario would be 40-to-50 parrots turning up in Melaleuca from September for the next round of breeding. While still a perilously low number, it would be more than double the wild population of a couple of years ago, when it fell to 17.\n\u201cThere\u2019s years when things are not good and it really is disheartening so you decide to celebrate the wins,\u201d Troy says.\n\u201cIt is an amazing feeling to have had over 100 birds migrate together, but at the same time it\u2019s one step. The real change we need to see is the number of birds in spring. That\u2019s census time.\u201d\nOne of the challenges in attempting to build a population from such a low base is its limited genetic diversity. In the spring of 2017, there were just three mature females remaining in the wild. That grew to 13 before last breeding season, but the reduced gene pool increases the risk of disease having a species-wide impact as the remaining birds have similar patterns of immunity.\nTroy says there is precedent for rebuilding a species from numbers this small. She gives the example of the black robin in New Zealand, which was reduced to one mature female in the wild before numbers rebounded into the hundreds.\n\u201cThere are plenty of populations of bird around the world where genetic diversity is low, but a species has still been able to recover,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is definitely a concern, but not necessarily a showstopper.\u201d\nDejan Stojanovic, leader of Australian National University\u2019s difficult birds research group, says the good breeding season is great news \u2013 obviously enough, there need to be more parrots in the wild for it to recover \u2013 but also stresses the greatest threat to the species is survival during the winter migration months.\n\u201cHopefully more birds leaving Tasmania corresponds to more survivors returning next spring to breed,\u201d he says. \u201cThe big test for all these parrots is still to come.\u201d",

And yet we must also recognise the risk of a second spike, the risk of losing control of that virus and letting the reproduction rate go back over one.\n\u201cThat would mean not only a new wave of death and disease but also an economic disaster and we will be forced once again to slam on the brakes across the whole country, and whole economy, and reimpose restrictions in such a way as to do more and lasting damage.\n\u201cI want to get this economy moving as fast as I can, but I refuse to throw away all the effort and sacrifice of the British people and risk a second major outbreak and huge loss of life and the overwhelming of the NHS.\u201d\nHe asked businesses to contain their impatience and understand that while there had been success in suppressing the illness, it was still a moment of significant national risk, despite \u201chaving begun together to wrestle [coronavirus] to the floor\u201d.\n\u201cSo it follows this is the moment of opportunity, this is the moment when we could press home our advantage. It is also the moment of maximum risk,\u201d he said.\nThere would be a point at which the UK could \u201cfire up the engines of this vast UK economy\u201d, Johnson said, but that would depend on meeting the five tests the government had set itself: the death rate falling, the NHS not being overwhelmed, the infection rate going down, getting on top of testing and personal protective equipment supplies, and avoiding a second peak of the disease.\nJohnson said there would also be \u201cmaximum possible transparency\u201d from now on, which may have been a direct response to mounting pressure on the government to release the scientific data it was relying on to make decisions, and to make public exactly who was sitting on its scientific advisory group, Sage.\nThe prime minister is expected to meet ministers throughout the week and regularly host the morning Covid-19 response meetings as he gets back to work since being admitted to hospital with the virus.\nEarlier, the health minister Edward Argar played down speculation that Johnson was expected to ease lockdown measures before 7 May, the next date by which ministers are due to review it.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very clear at the moment the science isn\u2019t saying we are ready to lift the restrictions that have been placed on people,\u201d Argar said. \u201cWe\u2019ve made huge progress, we\u2019ve seen that curve flattened in recent weeks \u2026 but we\u2019re not there yet.\u201d\nHe said the lockdown had been working and \u201cnow is not the time to let up\u201d.\nThe government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, has said the reproduction rate of the virus was now below one (an infected person is passing it on to fewer than one other person), but Argar would not be drawn on it in a round of morning media interviews.",

        "content": "Exclusive: only one species is responsible for coronavirus \u2013 humans \u2013 say world\u2019s leading wildlife experts\nThe coronavirus pandemic is likely to be followed by even more deadly and destructive disease outbreaks unless their root cause \u2013 the rampant destruction of the natural world \u2013 is rapidly halted, the world\u2019s leading biodiversity experts have warned.\n\u201cThere is a single species responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 us,\u201d they said. \u201cRecent pandemics are a direct consequence of human activity, particularly our global financial and economic systems that prize economic growth at any cost. We have a small window of opportunity, in overcoming the challenges of the current crisis, to avoid sowing the seeds of future ones.\u201d\nProfessors Josef Settele, Sandra D\u00edaz and Eduardo Brondizio led the most comprehensive planetary health check ever undertaken, which was published in 2019 by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). It concluded that human society was in jeopardy from the accelerating decline of the Earth\u2019s natural life-support systems.\nIn an article published on Monday, with Dr Peter Daszak, who is preparing the next IPBES assessment, they write: \u201cRampant deforestation, uncontrolled expansion of agriculture, intensive farming, mining and infrastructure development, as well as the exploitation of wild species have created a \u2018perfect storm\u2019 for the spillover of diseases.\u201d\nThese activities cause pandemics by bringing more people into contact and conflict with animals, from which 70% of emerging human diseases originate, they said. Combined with urbanisation and the explosive growth of global air travel, this enabled a harmless virus in Asian bats to bring \u201cuntold human suffering and halt economies and societies around the world. This is the human hand in pandemic emergence. Yet [Covid-19] may be only the beginning.\u201d\n\u201cFuture pandemics are likely to happen more frequently, spread more rapidly, have greater economic impact and kill more people if we are not extremely careful about the possible impacts of the choices we make today,\u201d they said.\nThe scientists said the multitrillion-dollar economic recovery packages being rolled out by governments must be used to strengthen and enforce environmental protection: \u201cIt may be politically expedient to relax environmental standards and to prop up industries such as intensive agriculture, airlines, and fossil-fuel-dependent energy sectors, but doing so without requiring urgent and fundamental change essentially subsidises the emergence of future pandemics.\u201d\nA global \u201cOne Health\u201d approach must also be expanded, they said. \u201cThe health of people is intimately connected to the health of wildlife, the health of livestock and the health of the environment. It\u2019s actually one health,\u201d said Daszak.\nFurthermore, surveillance programmes and health services need to be properly funded in nations on the frontlines of pandemic risk, they said: \u201cThis is not simple altruism \u2013 it is vital investment in the interests of all to prevent future global outbreaks.\u201d\nDaszak said: \u201cThe programmes we\u2019re talking about will cost tens of billions of dollars a year. But if you get one pandemic, even just one a century, that costs trillions, so you still come out with an incredibly good return on investment.\n\u201cBusiness as usual will not work. Business as usual right now for pandemics is waiting for them to emerge and hoping for a vaccine. That\u2019s not a good strategy. We need to deal with the underlying drivers.\u201d\nIn March, the UN\u2019s environment chief, Inger Andersen, told the Guardian \u201cnature is sending us a message\u201d with the coronavirus pandemic and the ongoing climate crisis. She said failing to take care of the planet meant not taking care of ourselves.\nLast week, the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said governments must seize the opportunity to \u201cbuild back better\u201d after the pandemic by creating more sustainable and resilient societies.\nProf Thomas Lovejoy, at the United Nations Foundation and George Mason University in the US, who coined the term \u201cbiological diversity\u201d in 1980, said on Saturday: \u201c[The pandemic] is not nature\u2019s revenge; we did it to ourselves.\u201d\n\u201cIt is the consequence of our persistent and excessive intrusion in nature and the vast illegal wildlife trade, and in particular the wildlife markets, the wet markets, of south Asia and bush meat markets of Africa,\u201d he said. Earlier in April, a major study found that the human impact on wildlife was to blame for the spread of viruses.\nIn the new article, the biodiversity experts said: \u201cWe can emerge from the current crisis stronger and more resilient than ever, [by] choosing actions that protect nature, so that nature can help to protect us.\u201d",

        "content": "Gilberto Ramirez hoped to give his son a better life in the US. Instead the 13-year-old was killed blocks from his new home\nGilberto Ramirez spent three years in Oakland, California, working long hours pruning trees and grooming lawns with one goal in mind: saving up enough money for his wife and four children back in San Pedro Necta, Guatemala, to come join him.\nIn March 2016, Ramirez got his wish when his wife, three sons and daughter reunited with him in East Oakland. They joined the fast-growing number of Central American immigrants building new lives in the Bay Area, many of whom came escaping violence and poverty in their home countries.\nBut within 19 months, the family\u2019s youngest son, eighth-grader Anibal Andres Ramirez was shot and killed. Police found his body on a bench on the evening of 10 October 2017 near the intersection of Foothill Blvd and Seminary Ave, blocks from the apartment the family rented.\nAnibal became the city\u2019s youngest gun homicide victim that year at just 13 years old.\nThe case has not been solved, and nearly two and a half years later, Gilberto Ramirez is still trying to make sense of how his plan to give his son a better life in Oakland backfired so badly.\n\u201cIt was my dream to have my family together in the United States,\u201d Ramirez told the Guardian in a recent interview in Spanish, which is his second language after the indigenous language Mam. \u201cSo much effort and suffering to raise the money to bring my son here, only to have some lowlife cut off my son\u2019s life. It hurts.\u201d\nAnibal Andres Ramirez\u2019s arrival in Oakland coincided with a surge in the local immigrant youth population.\nThe number of \u201cnewcomers\u201d \u2013 immigrant students who have arrived in the last three years and speak a language other than English \u2013 has nearly doubled in the Oakland unified school district since 2014. This year, one in seven high schoolers in the district are newcomers.\nThe kids come from countries all over the world, but the majority are from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. Some arrived with their parents, but many came as unaccompanied child migrants. Alameda county, where Oakland is located, has received more than 2,500 unaccompanied child migrants from federal shelters since 2015, making it California\u2019s top destination for these young people after Los Angeles county.\nBefore arriving in Oakland, many newcomer kids have already lived through trauma in their home countries or on the journey to the US. And for some, violence continued to haunt them even after their arrival.\n\u201cWhen I first arrived here in Oakland, I felt less safe than in Guatemala,\u201d student Kevin Xiloj said in Spanish, his second language after the native indigenous language K\u2019iche.\nXiloj left Guatemala when he was 17 to get away from the gangs that dominated his rough neighborhood in the city of Huehuetenango. But when he finally made it to East Oakland in 2015, he was greeted by frequent gunfire in his new neighborhood.\nHe said his American peers mocked him for not speaking English and were eager to pick fights. Xiloj followed the same rules he had learned growing up in Huehuetenango: Listen. Watch. Stay quiet.\nYet he found Oakland\u2019s unfamiliar streets more intimidating. At least back in Huehuetenango, Xiloj explained, \u201cI knew people, I knew my neighborhood, I knew who was who.\u201d\nEven as the gun homicide rate in Oakland fell by 44% between 2007 and 2017, it remains a persistent problem. More than 60 people have been killed by gunshot wounds each year in the city for the past several years. People of color are disproportionately affected. Latino Bay Area residents are 3.5 times more likely to be victims of gun homicides than their white counterparts. Black residents are 22 times more likely.\nThere are also signs that new immigrants in Oakland may be increasingly vulnerable.\nRicardo Garcia-Acosta of Youth ALIVE!, an Oakland-based violence intervention organization, found the tally of recent immigrant gun homicide victims have inched up in the past four years, even as total gun homicides in the city have fallen. In 2019, Youth ALIVE! documented 11 such cases in Oakland, up from six in 2016.\nMany victims were Latin American adult men fatally shot in what appeared to be robberies, Garcia-Acosta said. He noted non-English speaking immigrants may be targeted because they are less likely to notify police and are often unfamiliar with \u201cthe landscape and rules of the uniquely challenging streets of Oakland\u201d.\nIn Anibal\u2019s case, older teenage boys seemed to have been after him, his parents said. On a few occasions, the boy came home beaten up. Once, he was robbed of his cellphone. \u201cHe was bullied,\u201d his father, Gilberto Ramirez, recalled.\nThe 13-year-old often wore red clothing, which may have been a show of support for the gang that operated in his neighborhood, or a way to gain protection from it.\nNathaniel Dunstan, who oversees refugee and newcomer students for the district\u2019s English language learners and multilingual achievement team, said he grew concerned about Anibal months before he was killed and initiated a number of home visits.\n\u201cAt that time, the best way I knew to engage students at risk was to get them involved in Soccer Without Borders,\u201d Dunstan recalled, referring to a soccer program for immigrant and refugee youth.\nBut Anibal was not interested in soccer, and Dunstan said his outreach efforts \u201cfelt really inadequate\u201d.\nCapt Trevelyon Jones of Oakland police department\u2019s Ceasefire violence intervention program was one of the first officers on the scene the night Anibal was shot.\n\u201cI was there like maybe 45 seconds after he got shot,\u201d Jones recalled. \u201cI remember seeing him sitting there, [and] thinking like, \u2018Wow, this is a little kid.\u2019\u201d\nAnibal was wearing red the night he was shot. His clothing may have made him a target from rival groups. Sgt Brad Baker of Oakland police department declined to provide details about the open homicide investigation, but said there were \u201cgang connections\u201d to the case.\nAnibal\u2019s shooting catalyzed Dunstan and other educators to take action.\n\u201cAfter Anibal was killed, my office and administrators from across the district realized that we needed another tool, another intervention, to support newcomers that had safety concerns,\u201d Dunstan said.\nThe district had already hired bilingual social workers and therapists to work specifically with newcomers and their families. It had also forged relationships with local pro bono immigration attorneys to take on students\u2019 immigration cases. And since many older newcomer students must support themselves, the district had opened a new continuation high school, Rudsdale Newcomer high school, with a class schedule designed to make it easier for students to juggle classes and jobs.\nWhen Rudsdale first opened its doors, Emma Batten-Bowman, the founding assistant principal, noticed her incoming students often faced danger walking to and from school. \u201cOur newcomers are targeted. They\u2019re jumped. They\u2019re held at gunpoint,\u201d she said.\nIn the months following Anibal\u2019s murder, educators, community partners and newcomer students met periodically to brainstorm about what else to do. They identified dozens of factors making newcomer students vulnerable to becoming victims or perpetrators of violence, including dangerous local neighborhoods, past trauma, poverty, debts to smugglers and a lack of support systems. It became clear no existing local youth violence prevention program addressed the specific challenges facing newcomers.\nUltimately, the school district partnered with a local not-for-profit, Bay Area Community Resources, to hire safety specialists to implement a school district-wide violence prevention program for newcomers.\nThe new initiative launched the following school year.\nStarting up the new violence prevention program fell to Ernesto Qui\u00f1onez, the district\u2019s first newcomer safety specialist.\nQui\u00f1onez, who was born in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District, was gang-affiliated as a teenager and had been incarcerated for a string of offenses he committed as a juvenile, including assault and battery with a deadly weapon and armed robbery.\nBy August 2018, Qui\u00f1onez had been out of prison three years, and wanted to spend his time helping youth and \u201cundo some of the violence that I\u2019ve done\u201d.\nHe spent the fall of 2018 based out of Rudsdale Newcomer high school, a small campus of portable classrooms clustered around a courtyard.\nQui\u00f1onez\u2019s background allowed him to understand the unique pressures her students were facing, Batten-Bowman, the assistant principal, said: \u201cYou need somebody who knows the streets.\u201d\nRight away, Qui\u00f1onez was busy.\nA new student who had arrived only months earlier from Guatemala and did not yet understand the seriousness of gang colors, wore red T-shirts to school and was followed home and shot at by another student with a realistic-looking BB gun. A recent graduate was hospitalized after he was shot twice in the stomach. Students were jumped.\n\u201cThere were so many violent incidents that I was responding to them as fast as I could,\u201d Qui\u00f1onez recalled.\nQui\u00f1onez needed to help newcomer students across the school district, so he recruited Jose Garcia to take over as safety specialist for Rudsdale Newcomer.\nGarcia, a youth educator, activist and artist who had himself immigrated to Oakland as an 11-year-old from Mexico, discovered that adults involved in local criminal organizations were manipulating some newcomer students. The students were coerced into selling drugs or stealing in exchange for housing, he said. Some female students were ensnared by sex trafficking rings.\n\u201cA lot of these kids are falling into a lot of predatory dynamics just because they have no family,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cThey have no support system, they really have nobody.\u201d\nThe new safety specialists became that support system for the most at-risk newcomers. Qui\u00f1onez and Garcia designed a program to cycle the most vulnerable students into intensive case management \u2013 supporting them as they got out of dangerous situations, assisting them if they had run-ins with the criminal justice system, checking whether they had safe housing, linking them to social services, and eventually, helping students plan for their futures.\nThey created a class where at-risk students practice non-violent conflict resolution techniques, learn about commonalities between their Central American cultures, express themselves through art projects and burn off frustration with physical exercises like boxing.\nGarcia named the program \u201cYoung Hawks\u201d because hawks are sacred to many indigenous groups in the Americas. \u201cBut the problem with the hawk\u2019s energy is that if it\u2019s not channeled or is not given a purpose, then it can be destructive,\u201d Garcia said.\nHe noticed many students came to the US fleeing gangs and violence from Central America, but had little knowledge of the historical context that created those conditions.\n\u201cThey just blame [themselves] automatically for everything wrong with them and their communities,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cThey just feel like that\u2019s how the world works.\u201d\nGarcia responded by immersing his students in history, teaching about the violence indigenous peoples suffered during Europe\u2019s colonization of the Americas, and the United States\u2019 record of fueling violent conflicts in Central America. He explains that a high portion of guns in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador can be traced back to the United States.\n\u201cWe dive into those things so that they don\u2019t blame themselves or their parents for the world they inherited,\u201d Garcia said.\nAt the beginning of this school year, the Bay Area violence that Ernesto Qui\u00f1onez had been helping to quell struck close to home. His 19-year-old younger brother was shot and killed in San Francisco.\nThe tragedy deepened his resolve. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to this work,\u201d Qui\u00f1onez said. \u201cAnd we need to keep doing it.\u201d\nQui\u00f1onez has moved on to an oversight role of the Young Hawks program at Bay Area Community Resources and Garcia now supervises two other full-time safety specialists. The three safety specialists manage caseloads for about 120 newcomer students district-wide.\nEarlier this year, Garcia said his workday began \u201cwhenever that phone rings\u201d.\n\u201cSometimes it starts at 3 in the morning,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might not be on my contract. But that\u2019s what it takes to get the job done correctly.\u201d\n\u201cWhenever I need him, he is there,\u201d said Michael, a 17-year-old student who asked to only be identified by his first name for safety reasons. In an interview in Spanish, he called Garcia, \u201cA loyal friend.\u201d\nMichael said he left El Salvador when he was 13 because a cousin insisted he had to either join his gang, or be killed. Other relatives helped smuggle him out of town, and he eventually made it to Oakland.\nHe described feeling a mix of surprise and disappointment when he discovered gangs were also active in his new neighborhood, and a sense of relief when he realized safety specialists could help him.\nMichael said last year he and a friend crossed paths with a group of men on Oakland\u2019s Bancroft Avenue who claimed to be gang members and tried to start a fight. Police arrived. At the time, Michael was attending Castlemont high school, and called that school\u2019s newcomer safety specialist, Daniel Silva, for advice.\nSilva\u2019s response was immediate.\n\u201cHe arrived to help me,\u201d Michael said. \u201cThe police let me and my friend go.\u201d\nMichael transferred to Rudsdale Newcomer last fall. He sometimes went to class after spending the entire previous night on his feet packing produce at a warehouse.\n\u201cIt relaxes me,\u201d he said about being on campus. Other Rudsdale Newcomer students echoed the same sentiment.\nRudsdale Newcomer had turned a corner.\nEmma Batten-Bowman, the assistant principal, said there has not been any violence on campus or shootings involving her students so far this school year. She credits the safety specialists and Young Hawks.\n\u201cHaving a support person on campus who really understands what the kids are going through, the kids open up about their actual needs rather than make a bad decision,\u201d Batten-Bowman said.\n\u201cIt was just such a huge shift,\u201d she added.\nBut just as the Young Hawks program was showing signs of sustained success, the Covid-19 pandemic upended the routines educators had worked hard to build. Oakland unified school district closed school campuses in mid-March, and Garcia and his colleagues now keep up with students individually by phone and social media.\nMany students are facing financial emergencies after losing jobs at the same time school abruptly shuttered.\n\u201cKids were using school to get food, encouragement and support,\u201d Batten-Bowman said. \u201cNow they don\u2019t have that outlet.\u201d\nOakland police department does not track homicide victims by immigration status or country of origin, but in an interview in early March, Capt Jones of the Ceasefire program said it had been several months since he had heard of a new shooting involving Central American newcomer youth.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing compared to what we typically see with our traditional groups and gangs in the city of Oakland, which we spend most of our time focusing on,\u201d Jones said.\nHe said therapeutic approaches to gang intervention seem to be lowering Oakland\u2019s overall gang population and gun violence. \u201cWe know now we don\u2019t have a huge influx of gang members like we used to. So something\u2019s working.\u201d\nBefore the coronavirus pandemic hit, both Nathaniel Dunstan at the school district and Jose Garcia hoped to see the Young Hawks program expand to all six Oakland unified school district schools serving high school-age newcomers.\nBut more funding is needed to hire additional safety specialists, and Garcia said fundraising for newcomer safety was challenging even before the outbreak-related economic crisis.\nGarcia said although it is common to hear outrage in the Bay Area about how child migrants are treated by the federal government \u2013 including protests over \u201ckids in cages\u201d \u2013 that has not translated into resources for children when they are released into the community.\nLast month, Rudsdale Newcomer school administrators launched a GoFundMe to help their students pay for rent, bills and food through the summer. School staff, including Garcia, are assisting students to avoid eviction, pick up food at school sites, get internet access, find new jobs and apply for unemployment benefits if they qualify. They are also pleading with cellphone companies to not shut off students\u2019 phones over unpaid bills.\n\u201cWe are all social workers now,\u201d Batten-Bowman said.\nGarcia said he is grateful he had the chance to help at-risk students practice healthy habits and create positive support systems before this crisis hit. But he worries about very recent newcomers who have not yet enrolled in school or established a safety net.\n\u201cI\u2019m just kind of afraid that this [pandemic] is going to roll the boulder down the hill,\u201d Garcia said from his home where he is working remotely. \u201cIt might create a spike in violence or crime just out of sheer survival.\u201d\nThese days, Gilberto Ramirez, his wife and children are cloistered together at home, sheltering in place.\nAfter Anibal\u2019s death, they moved away from their old neighborhood and now live in a rental home closer to the city\u2019s Fruitvale district. They don\u2019t hear nearly as many gunshots any more.\nA framed photo of Anibal hangs over the family\u2019s couch. He is pictured with neatly gelled black hair, holding his hands up in the shape of a heart.\nRamirez has not been able to work since everything in the Bay Area shut down last month.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen,\u201d Ramirez said about whether his job delivering office furniture will ever start up again. \u201cWe are waiting to see.\u201d\nThe long days at home, sharing simple meals of rice, beans and chicken soup with his children, give Ramirez time to ponder whether anyone will ever be punished for Anibal\u2019s murder. He is growing agitated that nearly two and a half years have passed and police have not arrested anyone.\n\u201cWhy won\u2019t they do justice in this case?\u201d Ramirez questions. \u201cPolice will arrest you for speeding, but how come if someone is doing violence, harming your family, why not then?\u201d\nHe said he can\u2019t help wondering if justice for a poor Latino boy is not a police priority.\nThe Oakland police department\u2019s Sgt Brad Baker said the homicide was \u201cstill an open, active investigation\u201d, and that, \u201cwe treat all these cases equally across the board\u201d.\nAnibal\u2019s mother, Florinda, described him in her limited Spanish as \u201ca good son\u201d who always offered to help her by running errands for her at the store.\nIn the period after his death, Ramirez said his wife wept constantly and was too distraught to leave the house.\nLate last year, they welcomed a new baby girl.\nRamirez has started to wonder if he should think about moving his family of six out of Oakland for safety reasons.\n\u201cThere are a lot of criminals and murderers here,\u201d Ramirez said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t fight with their hands \u2013 they fight with guns.\u201d\nStill, he is grateful to Oakland for one kindness. A city official raised money for Anibal\u2019s funeral expenses.\nThe donations helped Ramirez send Anibal\u2019s body back to Guatemala, where the boy is buried in his home town.",

        "content": "States are banding together to fend for themselves, raising fears \u2013 or hopes \u2013 that the federal government\u2019s grip will be lessened\nGroups of American states have banded together to form regional partnerships to battle the coronavirus pandemic. The new unions, which now encompass 17 states, have potentially far reaching implications for how the US handles the virus and deals with Donald Trump\u2019s administration in the process.\nCalifornia, Oregon and Washington have formed the Western States Pact. Seven east coast states, stretching from Delaware to Massachusetts, have formed another alliance. And seven mostly midwestern states \u2013 encompassing a vast region that includes Minnesota, Ohio and Kentucky \u2013 have created a third group.\nThe development has even raised fears \u2013 or hopes \u2013 that the federal government\u2019s grip on America\u2019s states will be loosened, perhaps threatening the union itself. Minnesota\u2019s governor, Tim Walz, likened his midwestern alliance to \u201csort of a loose Articles of Confederation approach.\u201d California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, has even referred to his state as a \u201cnation state\u201d.\nThe groups coalesced quickly and organically through conversations between states\u2019 governors, who have been trading notes and ideas on how to respond to the pandemic. The motivation was partially in response to a White House that has wavered from taking full responsibility for the US\u2019s response to Covid-19 to saying that state governors are essentially responsible for tackling the pandemic.\nOregon\u2019s governor, Kate Brown, told the Guardian she had been texting with neighboring governors Jay Inslee in Washington and Newsom in California when the idea emerged.\n\u201cAs I started to think through how difficult it was to intentionally \u2013 literally \u2013 shutter our economy, I thought that it would be really good, even if we weren\u2019t taking the same steps, that we at least hold hands, that we create a shared framework,\u201d Brown recalled.\nBrown texted the two other governors asking them if they were interested in \u201cworking on a shared framework for reopening their states\u2019 economies\u201d.\nOn 13 April, the three governors announced their Western States Pact.\nThe coordination between the members of the Western States Pact has gone beyond the governors themselves. Brown said their chiefs of staff have been sharing strategy. Their directors of public health have been sharing resources.\n\u201cI think we could say we are aligned in the framework. We\u2019re all carving a path, but we\u2019re each taking individual directions in terms of the path,\u201d Brown said.\nSimilarly, Illinois\u2019 governor, JB Pritzker, had been texting and talking on the phone with his fellow midwestern governors. He had had a conversation with New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, where Pritzker suggested \u201cwe maybe need to all band together\u201d. In mid-April Pritzker, along with six other governors in the midwest, announced a partnership to reopen the regional economy. The partnership includes both Democratic and Republican governors.\n\u201cI think what we\u2019re looking to do is share best ideas first of all,\u201d Pritzker said in an interview. Second, he said, they want to make sure they\u2019re working together as they go through the phases of reopening their states\u2019 economies.\nCuomo and a swath of east coast governors have set up their own \u201cmulti-state council\u201d to \u201cto restore the economy and get people back to work\u201d.\nThe uniting idea behind the pacts is to formulate plans for easing restrictions and lockdown orders once the coronavirus threat dissipates. Those plans so far vary from the Trump administration\u2019s recently released guidelines for easing restrictions.\nOther governors have formed informal regional alliances. Maryland\u2019s governor, Larry Hogan; Washington DC\u2019s mayor, Muriel Bowser; and Virginia\u2019s governor, Ralph Northam, hold regular calls. New Hampshire\u2019s governor, Chris Sununu; Maine\u2019s governor, Janet Mills; and Vermont\u2019s governor, Phil Scott, have remained in contact throughout the pandemic, although those states aren\u2019t in the same formal east coast council with New York and others.\nPublicly and privately governors have groused that the Trump administration has been frustratingly inconsistent and unhelpful in directing the federal government to fight the pandemic, pushing states to go at it alone or in the groups they have formed.\nJared Leopold, a Democratic strategist and former communications director of the Democratic Governors Association, said the alliances were partially a result of a lack of national leadership.\n\u201cNature abhors a vacuum and with a vacuum of national leadership on the coronavirus crisis, states are having to fend for themselves,\u201d Leopold said. \u201cThat means putting together coalitions however they can.\u201d\nAlliances among governors aren\u2019t unprecedented in America. Governors have formed an alliance during the Trump presidency to fight the climate crisis. Nor do the partnerships mean the moves by each governor are uniform. Restrictions and executive orders approved by the Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer, are not the same as the ones by Ohio\u2019s governor, Mike DeWine.\nPritzker said it made sense that states in the same regions banded together rather than ones far apart.\n\u201cMy state is a little bit like Michigan in this sense: we have one big city, a very big city. And then we have some very small cities and a lot of agricultural territory in Illinois. Seventy per cent of our landmass is agricultural. And that\u2019s very similar to Indiana and Michigan,\u201d Pritzker said.\n\u201cCalifornia\u2019s very different. It\u2019s got multiple big cities, many \u2013 San Diego, San Francisco, and LA and so on. These are very big cities. So that\u2019s a different way of thinking than what we would need to do here. So that\u2019s some of the reason that these regional pacts work. We share a lot of similarities from state to state.\u201d\nThere are ongoing differences in the regional responses to the pandemic as well. A few southern states \u2013 Georgia, Tennessee and South Carolina \u2013 have been much more eager to loosen restrictions than other states across the country. Those states have not set up a formal pact.\nScott Pattison, a former executive director of the National Governors Association, expects that the states in the regional pacts will work together closely as they move forward.\n\u201cI\u2019m anticipating that they really do follow through,\u201d Pattison said. \u201cThat Washington state won\u2019t necessarily take substantive measures without consulting with Oregon and California \u2013 both for this moment but also to hopefully to create some precedence for effective groupings for the future.\u201d",

Beyond the horizon I imagine launching myself on wild journeys: trekking Nepal\u2019s high Annapurna trail or paddling a canoe across the dark mirror of a Canadian lake and leaving a trail of twisting whirlpools in my wake. In our changing new age, and with the need to limit long-haul air travel, I know that I\u2019ll never reach many of my fancied, far afield destinations. Yet I\u2019m determined to get back outdoors as soon as possible, starting in Berlin.\nI\u2019ve known three Berlins: West Berlin, where I made movies with David Bowie and Marlene Dietrich; East Berlin, where I researched my first book, Stalin\u2019s Nose; and today\u2019s united capital.\nTo the west of the city \u2013 starting at the end of the U3 U-Bahn line \u2013 spreads a lattice of pristine lakes and waterways: urban Krumme Lanke and Schlachtensee, narrow Templiner See with dozens of intimate beaches, idyllic Lake Glienicke, which was once cut in half by the Berlin Wall.\nIn the Havelseengebiet nature reserve, just south of Potsdam, water flows through the land like blood through a body. The rivers are the arteries; the streams are the veins. In summer it is a place best discovered by bicycle: step off a train in Wannsee or Potsdam, pedal west along bankside cycle lanes and pine-needle paths, find a quiet cove, then plunge into the water.\nAround and about, dragonflies mate in mid-flight, their wings knocking the rushes to make a sound like licking flames. Water spiders skate over the surface like minute balls of mercury. Birch tree branches are reflected in the water.\nOn my wished-for journey, lunch will be an alfresco picnic or \u2013 if I\u2019m feeling flush \u2013 trout and chanterelles at the F\u00e4hrhaus Caputh, overlooking the water from a deckside table. Of course today the F\u00e4hrhaus is closed, as are all other restaurants. The beaches are empty. On top of Germany\u2019s stringent lockdown restrictions, foreign citizens on \u201cnon-essential travels\u201d are refused entry to the country. But once the borders are open again, I\u2019ll be on my bike, and in that water, and out in the open air.\nRory MacLean is a travel writer and historian.

        "content": "Country eases coronavirus measures after quick response helped it limit cases to 7,400\nMany shops outside shopping malls are reopening in the Czech Republic after the government brought forward its five-stage lockdown exit plan, amid reports that the British government is closely watching the country\u2019s back-to-business strategy.\nUnder increasing pressure to lift parts of the UK\u2019s lockdown and limit the damage to the economy, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is understood to be studying the Czech Republic\u2019s approach to lifting the tight restrictions it imposed earlier than most countries further west, which have helped it limit cases to 7,400, with just 221 deaths.\nPrague was one of the few governments to declare a state of emergency before the country had recorded its first coronavirus death. By 11 March it had closed all schools, limited public gatherings, banned all public events, sealed its borders and shuttered all non-essential stores. It also made face masks obligatory in public.\nEarly this month it became the first European country to relax its restrictions, initially by allowing citizens to cycle, jog and walk in the countryside without wearing their masks, as long as they stayed 2 metres apart.\nSome sports facilities, such as tennis courts and golf courses, were allowed to reopen as long as no more than two people played together, and selected non-essential shops \u2013 including cycle stores, repair shops and hardware and DIY stores \u2013 also returned to business on 9 April.\nOn 15 April the government unveiled a detailed five-step plan to reopen the broader economy, with the deputy prime minister, Karel Havl\u00ed\u010dek, dividing businesses and activities into five main groups which would reopen their doors in stages over the following eight weeks.\nCraft shops, car dealerships and farmers\u2019 markets were the first to reopen from 20 April, with smaller shops outside shopping malls scheduled to follow on 27 April, then larger shops outside malls, driving schools and fitness centres.\nThe final stages were to happen in late May and early June, with restaurants allowed to serve customers outside, and hairdressers and beauty salons permitted to reopen, followed by shopping malls. Bars and restaurants were to be allowed to resume indoor service by 9 June, with hotels also allowed to reopen.\nPublic amenities and meeting places, such as museums and galleries, as well as cultural venues including theatres, would be among the last facilities to reopen, while schools were to start returning from 11 May. Havl\u00ed\u010dek stressed that the government reserved the right to adjust its dates.\nAs its infection curve continued to fall, however, the government last Thursday brought forward its exit plan, speeding up the process. Most venues are now to reopen two weeks earlier than initially planned, with gyms and all stores smaller than 2,500sq m outside shopping malls allowed to reopen on Monday.\nThe five-stage plan is now a four-stage plan: outdoor restaurant and bar areas reopen from 11 May, along with hairdressers and beauty salons, with restaurants expected to resume indoor service and hotels allowed to reopen from 25 May, two weeks earlier than the previous 8 June date.\nThe government also unexpectedly announced it would open its borders for outbound foreign travel after recording a decline in the number of infections. The health minister, Adam Vojt\u011bch, said returning travellers would have to prove they were uninfected or spend 14 days in quarantine.\nFace masks will remain mandatory until the end of June, but restrictions are being eased on movement within the country, with groups of up to 10 now permitted to gather, compared with a previous limit of two.\nThe full breakdown of the country\u2019s lockdown exit plan is as follows:\nAlready open (since 20 April):\nCraftspeople and tradespeople with shops\nFarmers\u2019 markets\nCar dealerships\nWeddings for up to 10 people\n27 April:\nMost shops below 2,500sq m, unless in big shopping malls\nDriving schools\nGyms, although changing rooms and showers remain closed\nLibraries\nOutdoor areas of zoos and botanical gardens\nChurch services for fewer than 15 people\n11 May:\nRetail stores in malls\nRetail stores larger than 2,500sq m outside malls\nHairdressers, beauty salons, massage parlours\nOutdoor and garden areas of restaurants, pubs and cafes\nMuseums, galleries, and art halls\n25 May:\nIndoor service in restaurants, bars and cafes\nHotels\nTaxis\nTheatres\nTattooists",

At least 206,803 people have lost their lives in the coronavirus pandemic, though the true toll is likely to be much higher due to under-reporting and some countries not including deaths among those with underlying conditions.\nFrance is due to announce plans to ease strict lockdown measures in its promised \u201cdeconfinement plan\u201d. Germany has urged states to \u201cgo carefully\u201d with the lifting of restrictions. Primary school children in Norway have gone back to class after the government declared it had controlled the outbreak. Spain announced 331 more deaths as it begins to loosen lockdown rules. Greece is preparing to lift restrictions on movements to the islands. European stock markets have rallied.\nThe prime minister said the UK is turning the tide on tackling coronavirus but still facing a moment of \u201cmaximum risk\u201d and he will not be forced to end the lockdown prematurely. Speaking outside 10 Downing Street on Monday, his first day back after recovering from coronavirus, he urged the public and business to contain their impatience to lift the restrictions.\nA further 96 people have died of coronavirus in Iran taking its death toll to 5,806, the ministry of heath announced. But Iran plans to go ahead with reopening mosques in areas where the virus has not struck.\nRussia has confirmed 6,198 new coronavirus cases over the past day, bringing the total number in the country to 87,147 in all regions, the anti-coronavirus crisis centre reported on Monday. This is more than the 84,500 confirmed cases in China. Meanwhile, China has denied it is spreading disinformation about the virus.\nThe government reported only one new confirmed case of Covid-19 and said it had eliminated the virus. At 11.59pm on Monday, New Zealand will lift its level-4 lockdown which has been in place for more than four weeks. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said the nation had \u201cwon the battle\u201d against widespread community transmission.\nColorado, Mississippi, Minnesota, Montana and Tennessee will join other US states in the lifting of lockdown restrictions, as economists predict an unemployment rate of 16% or higher for the month of April. The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, said some regions of the state might qualify to open sooner \u201cwith certain precautions\u201d, such as upstate New York, as the daily death toll was markedly lower on Sunday than it was on Saturday.",
